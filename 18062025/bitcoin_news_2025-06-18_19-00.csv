2025-06-18T16:56:37,"Gambling with bitcoins: what is a live casino?","BitcoinWorld Gambling with bitcoins: what is a live casino? A live casino with bitcoins is a new and exciting way to enjoy gambling from the comfort of your own home. It’s pretty cool, isn’t it? In such casinos, you can not only feel the atmosphere of a real establishment, but also bet using cryptocurrency. Las Atlantis bitcoin live casino is no longer a fantasy, but a reality! The platform provides access to games with live dealers, where everything happens in real time, and at the same time you can use bitcoins for betting. The main advantage of this format is convenience. Payments with bitcoins are fast and secure. You don’t have to worry about long transfers and commissions, as in the case of traditional currencies. And the process of playing with live dealers becomes much brighter when you see the cards being dealt right in front of you, instead of waiting for the machine to process them. It’s like being at the center of the action, just on the screen. Gambling and bitcoins are a combination that opens up new possibilities. At a casino with bitcoins, you can not only bet, but also withdraw your winnings quickly and hassle-free. And when it’s all backed by real people, the game becomes much livelier. So if you want to try your luck and enjoy the real gameplay, a live bitcoin casino is the way to go. Why choose a bitcoin casino? Using bitcoins for betting is not just a fashion trend, but a practical and convenient solution. Firstly, cryptocurrency greatly simplifies financial transactions. Payments are instant and commissions are minimal. No bank transfers and long waits. Bitcoin is a direct way to fast and convenient transactions, which in turn makes the gaming process much more pleasant. In addition, bitcoins give you more freedom. You can play casino games with bitcoins from almost anywhere in the world. Blockchain allows transactions without intermediaries, which means that you can avoid the restrictions that are often imposed by traditional banks or payment systems. This is especially important for those who want to play casino games without worrying about banking restrictions. And of course, bitcoin as a cryptocurrency provides users with a high level of security. Every transaction is recorded on the blockchain, making it transparent and safe from hacking. In traditional casinos, there is always a chance that the transaction information will fall into the wrong hands. In the case of bitcoins, you don’t have to worry about the security of your data, and this is a significant advantage. Live bitcoin games: how does it work? Live casino games with bitcoins are no different from standard games with live dealers. The only difference is that you use cryptocurrency instead of traditional currencies. For example, if you play roulette, blackjack or baccarat, everything will happen the same way as in a regular casino: the dealer deals the cards, spins the roulette or conducts the game. The only difference is that you pay for your bets with bitcoins. This format of playing with bitcoins has a lot of advantages. It not only allows you to enjoy the real game, but also to conduct transactions with minimal fees. Payments are fast and no one interferes with the process. All bets and winnings are recorded in the blockchain, which gives you confidence in the integrity of the game. You see everything in real time and can follow the croupier’s every move. Live casino for bitcoins also allows you to play with real people. And that’s a huge plus! Instead of playing with machines, you interact with live dealers who are ready to comment on the game or make jokes. This adds even more atmosphere to the process. And most importantly, everything happens in real time, with no delays like in a classic casino. Games with bitcoins: what to choose? There is a wide range of games available at live casinos with bitcoins. If you like classic card games, blackjack or baccarat will definitely suit you. In blackjack, the goal is to score 21 points or get close to that number without exceeding it. A simple but fun game that requires a bit of strategy. And if you want something more dynamic, you can try poker with a live dealer. For many players, poker is not just a game, but a real art, where not only luck is important, but also the ability to read your opponents. Roulette is another classic choice. European, French or American – any version of roulette for bitcoins will be exciting. Like other games, you’ll have to place bets and hope the ball stops on the right number or color. But how exciting it is to watch the wheel spin and wait for the result! If you want something unusual, you can try sic-bo, monopoly or other non-standard games that are often found in live cryptocurrency casinos. Each of these games has its own peculiarities and brings a special excitement. And, of course, we should not forget that bets in such games can be made with bitcoins, which adds another facet to the gameplay. Tips for beginners: how to start playing? If you are just starting to play live casino for bitcoins, the main thing is to take your time. Of course, excitement can be strong, and you want to bet a large amount at once. But it is best to start with small bets to get used to the process. Watch a few rounds and observe how the dealers work is always useful. This will give you time to get used to the interface and understand how transactions work. The second tip is to choose tables with minimal stakes. This will give you a chance to learn the rules of the game without risking a lot of money. Gradually, when you feel more confident, you can increase the stakes. This way you will get all the benefits of playing with a live dealer without worrying about spending too much. Don’t forget to communicate with the dealer and other players. In chat rooms you can ask questions and discuss the game. This is not only useful, but also pleasant, because all players communicate with each other, creating the atmosphere of a real casino. Why try a live casino for bitcoins? Live casino with bitcoins is convenience, security and excitement in one flacon. Fast transactions, minimal fees and the ability to chat with real people create a unique experience. And it doesn’t matter where you are – all you need is an internet connection, and there you are at the center of the action. Even if it’s morning and you’re sitting in your pajamas with a cup of coffee, the excitement doesn’t disappear, because a real game with live dealers doesn’t require special attire or a strict dress code. Playing with bitcoins adds to the freedom. You are not tied to banks, do not worry about currency restrictions and do not waste time on currency exchange. All it takes is a few clicks and a small balance in cryptocurrency. And don’t forget that for many people this is also a way to try out new technologies, because cryptocurrency is rapidly developing and its popularity continues to grow. So if you want to try something new, with live dealers and bitcoins, you should give this casino a chance. With each new round, the excitement will grow, and the pleasure of playing with real people in real time will only increase.

2025-06-18T16:55:54,"Accountant Nearly Pulls Off $19,000,000 Bank Fraud Scam After Tricking Lenders With Forged Documents and Fake Rent Rolls: DOJ","A certified public accountant is pleading guilty to defrauding banks by giving false information in order to obtain loans, according to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). The DOJ says Christine Gendron was a financial manager at real estate firm JLL Realty Developers, where her sister, Jeanette Norman, and brother-in-law, Masaschi, were partners. According to the DOJ, Gendron entered into a conspiracy with her brother-in-law and, allegedly, her sister to defraud financial institutions. “Specifically, Masaschi, Gendron, and allegedly Norman, provided materially false, fictitious and fraudulent financial information, including false rent rolls and forged lease agreements, to obtain loans for their companies.” Gendron’s brother-in-law and, allegedly, her sister were partners in several other limited liability companies, which mostly owned commercial and residential properties in, among other places, Connecticut and Western Massachusetts. The DOJ says that after obtaining the loans, Gendron’s brother-in-law and, allegedly, her sister, as well as their firms, only partially repaid the loans or didn’t pay at all. This resulted in financial institutions incurring substantial losses of over $19 million, per the Justice Department. Gendron could now spend decades in prison once convicted of her criminal charges. “The charge of conspiracy to commit bank fraud provides for a sentence of up to 30 years in prison, five years of supervised release and a fine of up to $1 million or twice the gross gain or loss.” Gendron’s sister, who has pleaded not guilty, is scheduled to stand trial in October.

2025-06-18T16:51:36,"Cardano Price Prediction: Hoskinson’s Bitcoin Fund Could Trigger Long-Awaited ADA Breakout","Cardano may be on the brink of a major DeFi transformation, with founder Charles Hoskinson proposing a $100 million sovereign wealth fund to supercharge the network’s ecosystem, an idea that could add weight to bullish long-term Cardano price forecasts . The proposal would see 5% to 10% of the protocol’s treasury diversified into assets like Bitcoin and “yield-bearing instruments” like USDM—Cardano’s native stablecoin . The stablecoin strategy centers around a self-reinforcing feedback loop: earn passive income by providing liquidity through staking, then use that income to buy back ADA and refill the treasury. A Sovereign Wealth Fund Could Challenge Ethereum and Solana Hoskinson estimates the strategy —if annualised—could grow the Cardano stablecoin treasury to $1 billion within 5-10 years, creating a more stable floor to encourage DeFi activity. Cardano Founder Proposes Deploying $100M of $ADA Treasury to Boost #Cardano DeFi and Reinvest in $ADA . pic.twitter.com/JSNAIIYfkv — Altcoin Daily (@AltcoinDaily) June 12, 2025 He noted that Ethereum and Solana are ahead in terms of stablecoin-to-TVL ratios, which enables them to lead in DeFi. With this strategy, Cardano could close the gap. The inclusion of Bitcoin would serve as a hedge against the inflationary risks of fiat-pegged stablecoins, adding a defensive layer to the fund’s composition. However, community governance stands in the way of its implementation, and not everyone is on board. While Hoskinson maintains that the conversion is unlikely to negatively impact the ADA price, community members do not support 9-figure sell pressure in an already fragile market. “If you hope to sell 140m at $0.7 next month, the market will ensure you sell it for $0.5,” commentator Cardano Whale added on X . Cardano Price Analysis: Could the Fund Push a Breakout? While the Cardano community governance process could delay implementation, a buy-the-rumor response from the market could fuel the breakout of the huge 7-month falling wedge pattern. After several failed attempts breakout, the last rejection has set the Cardano price on the path to retest its lower boundary. ADA / USDT 3-day chart, falling wedge pattern. Source: TradingView, Binance. It currently holds the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level as interim support at $0.60—a level which typically coincides with local bottoms in a shallow retracement. $0.60 has also acted as a significant demand zone since late 2024, but momentum indicators now cast doubt over its strength. The RSI reversed sharply after being rejected at the neutral 50 mark. This reflects fading bullish strength, especially after bears failed to capitalize on recent seller exhaustion. More so, the MACD confirms early signs of sustained downside, having widened its gap below the signal line after a death cross to start June. If ADA loses the $0.60 level, it could delay a breakout, ruling out the current $1 technical target based on the 1.618 Fib extension—an 80% gain from current prices. This bearish case could see the Cardano price fall 14% to the $0.50 support that marked the mid-April market bottom. Looking further ahead, the July 15 Cardano ETF decision could be the next solid fundamental catalyst ADA needs to renew momentum, increasing demand in traditional investment markets. Traders Could Maximise Their Gains Potential With This Simple Tool When it comes to large coins like Cardano, timing is everything. It takes months for breakouts to build, and as short as a week for them to unfold—holders spend most of their time waiting. Meanwhile, newer coins making the rounds like Aura are posting 46x gains in a single day. That’s where Snorter ($SNORT) steps in. Its purpose-built trading bot is engineered to spot early momentum, helping investors get in before the crowd—where the real gains are made.

The cryptocurrency's response to this event could either stabilize its price or send it tumbling. Investors and traders are on edge, eager to learn which coins might thrive amid the turbulence. Stay tuned to uncover potential winners in this tense market scenario. Bitcoin Struggles to Break Key Barriers, Bears in Control Source: tradingview Bitcoin is currently facing challenges, hovering between around $102K and almost $110K. The bulls are struggling as BTC battles to break past the nearby resistance at just over $114K. In contrast, the bears seem strong with support just under $99K. If bears continue, Bitcoin could drop further, nearing $91K. However, if bulls gain momentum and push Bitcoin above the $114K mark, the next big target would be about $121K. This could mean a rise of almost 18% from the current lower range. With Bitcoin's current indicators showing weakness, the market is waiting to see if bulls can rally soon. Conclusion Bitcoin’s struggle at key resistance zones signals a fragile market sentiment heading into the FOMC decision. If bulls can’t reclaim momentum soon, a deeper correction could follow. But for sharp-eyed investors, volatility also breeds opportunity. The next few days could separate short-term panic from long-term positioning—and spotlight which assets are truly built to endure.

In a recent post on X, ZachXBT spoke about the growing scale of crypto-related crime and estimated that the so-called “Black U” market operating on the Tron blockchain may be worth between $5 billion and $10 billion. However, much of it remains untraceable. Is Crypto “Ripe For Abuse”? He pointed to attacks on platforms such as Bybit , DMM Bitcoin, and WazirX, where stolen assets were laundered “with ease,” and added that laundering groups have “seemingly won the battle” over enforcement. The investigator further criticized protocol teams that continue to earn fees while turning a blind eye to illicit activity, and noted that over 50% of some protocols’ usage may stem from stolen funds. ZachXBT’s comments also reflect broader frustration over what he terms a “crime supercycle” – an era marked by minimal accountability. He cited a surge in abuse following the launch of meme coins by politicians and the dismissal of key court cases, which has allowed malicious actors to operate with little fear of repercussions. With influencers scamming followers and courts siding with smart contract exploiters, he warns that without meaningful enforcement or public pressure, the long-term consequences for the crypto ecosystem could be severe. “Can we fix the system if the vast majority of people still do not care unless they lose money? It’s concerning about what the long term ramifications may be even if these decisions benefit us in the short term. If you ever wanted the opportunity to extract from the industry there’s not been much of a better time. Take a chance what’s the worst thing that could happen if everyone’s already doing it?” Lazarus Group’s Latest Trap Lazarus Group was recently reported to have been shifting its social engineering tactics, now targeting centralized finance (CeFi) job seekers with a new malware campaign dubbed “ClickFix,” according to a recent report by cybersecurity firm Sekoia. Unlike previous attacks on developers, this method zeroes in on non-technical professionals by impersonating major crypto firms like Coinbase and Tether. Victims are tricked into running PowerShell commands to “fix” fake webcam issues during interviews, unknowingly installing malware. With 184 fake invitations referencing 14 companies, this strategy marks a disturbing evolution in Lazarus’s targeting and psychological manipulation techniques within the crypto sector.

2025-06-18T16:30:53,"Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Could Rise 3x To $300,000 As AVIV Levels Resemble Previous Bull Cycles","Bitcoin has continued to hover above the $100,000 mark over the past few days, and its price action has stabilized around $105,000 in the wake of recent market tensions and despite inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs. A new analysis shared by crypto market commentator Gert van Lagen suggests that this current phase is going to precede an explosive move similar to those seen in previous market cycles. Backing his prediction with historical data and Glassnode’s AVIV Ratio chart, the analyst noted that the current on-chain structure echoes moments before Bitcoin’s major rallies in past bull markets. AVIV Ratio Flashes Familiar Pattern Before Market Top Bitcoin’s price volatility has slightly cooled since the initial surge to a new all-time high above $111,800 in May, and the latest candlestick structure suggests it may be preparing for another leg higher. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Price Bounce To $120,000 Or Will It Break Below $100,000? Taking to the social media platform X, Gert van Lagen revealed a Bitcoin price prediction that centers around the true market Deviation metric known as the AVIV Ratio. This orange-colored line on the chart tracks a specific deviation in Bitcoin’s market behavior and has always crossed a red line denoting +3 standard deviations at or just before cycle tops. The current AVIV behavior can be compared to previous price points before market tops in previous cycles. For instance, in 2013, the AVIV Ratio flagged a major rally when Bitcoin was trading near $200, shortly before the price pushed past $1,200. In 2017, the metric behaved similarly when Bitcoin was trading at $3,700 and later peaked near $20,000. The current AVIV Ratio can also be compared to when Bitcoin was priced at $13,000 in the 2021 bull market run, before its surge to an all-time high of $69,000. According to the analyst, today’s AVIV ratio level is closely aligned with those previous mid-cycle breakouts. The current ratio has not yet crossed the red +3σ line, which the analyst refers to as the cycle top trigger. As such, its current reading suggests Bitcoin may be in the early phase of a major bull market expansion. If history repeats itself, a 3x move from today’s levels would be a standard price move in line with previous price action. $300,000 Target Within Sight If AVIV Behavior Holds Crypto analyst van Lagen stops short of calling for an immediate top, but his analysis implies that Bitcoin could be preparing for a new parabolic surge to the upside. Using the AVIV model as a reference, a conservative 3x multiplier on the current Bitcoin price places a possible target around $300,000. Related Reading: Key Fractal From 2023 Says Bitcoin Price Is Still Bullish, But A Crash To $90,000 Could Be Coming At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,997, having decreased by 1.4% in the past 24 hours. This decline has brought its price down from an intraday high of $106,795 back into its consolidation range around $105,000.

This comes as the meme coin retests the key historic support zone that marked the mid-April market bottom. Since a local top in mid-May, a 30% drop has put this level back in question. 2-Hour Chart Could Soon Flip the Scales According to analysis shared by Crypto Sat on X , Dogecoin is showing signs of accumulation following its sharp correction, with a potential double bottom pattern forming on the 2-hour chart. DOGE / USDT 2-hour chart, double bottom pattern. Source: X, @cryptosatred. This classic reversal pattern could signal a local bottom and pave the way for a bullish continuation, provided key technical levels hold. The first bottom formed around $0.168, where buyers stepped in to defend support following a sharp selloff. A second bounce here—accompanied by supporting volume—would be an “early bull sign,” though the key focus is placed at the $0.20 neckline resistance. The neckline could “decide the next big move”—a break above it would confirm the pattern and signal a sentiment shift favoring bulls. That said, a lower low below $0.165 could suggest increasing bearish pressure as buyers fail to defend the once strong support. Dogecoin Price Analysis: How This Ties into the Bigger Picture Zooming out, the $0.168 level aligns with a historically critical support zone, repeatedly marking local bottoms since mid-2024—the most recent being the mid-April market reversal. This support crosses a descending channel, forming the handle of a wider 4-year cup-and-handle pattern—a potential confluence zone for a breakout setup. DOGE / USDT 1-week chart, cup-and-handle confluence zone. Source: TradingView, Binance. A confirmed breakout would set a technical target around $0.75—a staggering 345% gain from current levels in line with the 1.618 Fibonacci extension. However, this bullish case only holds if the $0.168 support level is maintained, and momentum indicators are flashing caution. The golden cross from May has proven to be short-lived as the MACD line widens its gap below the signal line after a death cross to start June—a sign of a prevailing longer-term downtrend. The RSI also lends to weakening buy pressure, continuing its decline below the neutral line to its current position at 42. Below $0.168 lies a dangerous “gap area”—a price range with sparse previous buying activity, creating little historical support to limit downside. If lost, the next major support zone sits around 47% lower at $0.90, last tested during mid-2024. From there, all eyes turn to the June 15 US spot Dogecoin ETF decision, as a potential external catalyst, opening the doors to demand from traditional investment markets if approved. Bitcoin Could Have the Edge, With Some Help Those who jumped to speculative plays like Dogecoin over the leading crypto may be forced to reconsider as the Bitcoin ecosystem finally addresses its biggest limitation: scalability. Slow transactions, high fees, and limited programmability have held it back from competing with the Ethereum and Solana networks—until now. And this shift starts with Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Bitcoin’s first real-time Layer 2 that brings Solana-level speed and smart contracts directly to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and anchored by a decentralized Canonical Bridge, it enables fast, cheap, and composable dApps—all while staying secured by Bitcoin. With over $1.3 million in its third presale week, investors are already rallying behind $HYPER , potentially credited to its huge 651% APY on staking that rewards early investors.

2025-06-18T16:26:51,"Prenetics joins Bitcoin arms race with $20m buy and bold new board","In a move straight from the Strategy playbook, Prenetics has become the first health sciences firm to execute an aggressive Bitcoin treasury strategy, securing $20 million worth of BTC and appointing crypto veteran Andy Cheung to its board. According to a press release on June 18, Nasdaq-listed health sciences firm Prenetics Global has bought $20 million worth of Bitcoin ( BTC ), at an average price of $106,712 per token via Kraken. The move positions the company as the latest to join the corporate Bitcoin accumulation race started by Michael Saylor’s Strategy in August 2020. The Tysons Corner, Virginia-based firm pivoted to BTC with an initial purchase of $250 million and has accumulated over $60 billion worth of the original cryptocurrency in the last five years, proving that corporate treasuries can thrive under a Bitcoin standard. You might also like: Why are Bitcoin and crypto prices down today? Bitcoin meets biotech: a new vision for healthcare and finance Now, Prenetics is betting that healthcare, a sector traditionally cautious with capital allocation, can follow suit. With a $117 million war chest, zero debt, institutional financing partnerships, and a board now stacked with crypto heavyweights, the company isn’t just mimicking Strategy’s approach, it’s adapting it to an industry where digital assets remain uncharted territory. “We’re at the dawn of a new era where genomics, personalized medicine, and digital assets will intersect in ways that could revolutionize how we approach human health, longevity and wealth. To execute this vision at scale, we need substantial Bitcoin holdings – which is why we’re building one of the most significant Bitcoin treasuries in healthcare,” Danny Yeung, CEO of Prenetics, said. Alongside the Bitcoin purchase, the company made a strategic power move by appointing Andy Cheung, former COO of OKX, to its board. Cheung brings over a decade of experience at the highest levels of the crypto exchange world, having overseen billions in daily trading volume and architected complex trading infrastructure. Now the CEO of both OEX and PredicXion, Cheung’s insight into institutional-grade crypto strategies, from derivatives trading to yield optimization, embodies the kind of expertise Prenetics needs to transform its Bitcoin holdings from a static reserve into an active treasury engine. But he’s not alone. Prenetics has also enlisted Tracy Hoyos Lopez, the Kraken executive who orchestrated Donald Trump’s pro-Bitcoin pivot, and Raphael Strauch, founder of TOKEN2049, the world’s largest crypto conference. Together, they form a crypto advisory team that blends regulatory savvy, institutional connections, and hardcore trading expertise. Meanwhile, Prenetics’ Bitcoin strategy extends beyond the initial purchase. The company said it has secured board approval to allocate a majority of its balance sheet to BTC and deploy alpha-generating strategies, including yield farming and structured products. It also plans to begin accepting Bitcoin payments across its health platforms by year’s end.

Based on historical price patterns, Bitcoin could rise to $145,000 by September 2025, according to a June 18 post on TradingView by TradingShot Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView The analysis highlighted the weekly timeframe as a key bullish signal, with Bitcoin closing five consecutive weekly candles above an important pivot trendline. This same level acted as strong resistance between December 9, 2024, and January 27, 2025, when all weekly closes remained below it. In contrast, recent candles have closed above the trendline, suggesting a change in market structure. The past two weekly candles were nearly flat, showing market consolidation led by a balance between buyers and sellers. Bitcoin’s possible 40% rally Using Fibonacci analysis, TradingShot set the 1.0 level at the pivot line, projecting the 2.0 extension just above $145,000, an almost 40% rally from the current prices. The positive outlook comes shortly after Bitcoin faced a notable downturn amid rising geopolitical tensions involving Iran. As reported by Finbold, the asset led a broader market sell-off during this time. However, institutional interest remains strong. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded over $1.46 billion in inflows since June 9, according to on-chain data from Santiment as of June 17, signaling continued confidence despite recent volatility. Bitcoin price analysis By press time, Bitcoin had reclaimed the $104,000 resistance level, trading at $104,760, up nearly 1% on the day. On a weekly basis, the asset is down a slight 0.1%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Short-term indicators hint at further gains. Bitcoin is trading just above its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $104,236, while the 200-day SMA sits at $87,557, confirming a strong long-term uptrend. Meanwhile, the 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) stands at 50.63, reflecting neutral momentum with no signs of overbought or oversold conditions.

2025-06-18T16:03:39,"Bitcoin DeFi Project Elastos Debuts BTC-Backed Stablecoin BTCD","A Bitcoin-blockchain based decentralized finance (DeFi) project debuted a stablecoin fully backed by bitcoin BTC tokens as part of its effort to build a financial system centered on the largest and oldest cryptocurrency. Elastos , developer of the BeL2 protocol, unveiled its bitcoin dollar (BTCD) on Wednesday. The project aims to create a digital version of the Bretton Woods system , the post-World War II agreement that pegged the U.S. dollar to gold, making the greenback the world's reserve currency as a means of fostering monetary stability. Elastos said it is ""reimagining [Bretton Woods] with Bitcoin at its core."" Stablecoins are tokens pegged to the value of a traditional financial asset, such as a fiat currency, usually the dollar. They're an important cog in the cryptocurrency machine because they counter the volatility of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, allowing users to hold capital in digital assets without having to factor in wild price swings. Dollar-pegged stablecoins are usually backed by short-term U.S. Treasuries that can easily be cashed in or purchased to meet fluctuating demand. BTCD is backed by bitcoin, a counterintuitive choice for a token that's mean to hold a stable value. Elastos deals with this through overcollateralization of 160%-200% of BTCD's value in bitcoin, Ahmed IJ, the head of marketing, told CoinDesk on Telegram. ""Oracles feed the BTC-USD rate each block,"" he said. ""If cover falls to 110%, arbitrage may repay the debt, grab the BTC at a small discount, and erase the risk. ""When BTCD trades above a dollar, holders burn it to reclaim BTC, supply falls and the price slides. If it dips below a dollar, users mint it with fresh BTC and sell, supply rises, price lifts."" The development of a BTC-backed stablecoin forms part of the broader development of bitcoin-powered DeFi , in which the security of the Bitcoin network and the vast reserves of BTC are used to secure and fund decentralized activity elsewhere in the blockchain world.

2025-06-18T16:02:00,"Here’s why Michael Saylor’s Strategy stock price is about to surge","Strategy stock price has remained in a tight range in the past few weeks as Bitcoin has consolidated. MSTR was trading at $375 on Tuesday, down by over 12% from its highest point this year and 30% lower than the all-time high. This article provides a MSTR stock forecast and the key levels to watch. Strategy stock price technical analysis The daily chart shows that the MSTR share price bottomed at $231.70 in February, where it formed a double-bottom pattern with a neckline at $342.80. A double bottom is one of the most bullish reversal patterns, which explains why it rebounded and reached a high of $429.87. The stock has now formed a bullish pennant pattern, comprising of a vertical line and a symmetrical triangle, a popular bullish reversal sign in technical analysis. The two lines of this triangle are now nearing their confluence level, which happens before it stages a breakout. The profit target in a bullish pennant is estimated by first subtracting its lower side from its upper point. In this case, one subtracts $231 from $429, giving the flagpole height of $198. The next stage is where one adds the breakout point to the height. This breakout level could be about $385, which will bring the target to $583, which is about 55% above the current level. A drop below the support at $340 will invalidate the bullish Strategy stock price forecast. If this happens, the next point to watch will be the double-bottom point at $230. MSTR stock price chart | Source: TradingView Read more: This stock could nearly double your money in 2025—here’s why The bullish case for MSTR stock The main catalyst for Strategy stock is Bitcoin’s price action. A strong Bitcoin price surge will boost the value of its holdings and push its stock higher. Strategy has continued to accumulate Bitcoins. In a statement this week, the company said that it acquired over 10,000 new coins, bringing its cumulative total to over 590,000. Michael Saylor @saylor · Follow Strategy has acquired 10,100 BTC for ~$1.05 billion at ~$104,080 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 19.1% YTD 2025. As of 6/15/2025, we hodl 592,100 $BTC acquired for ~$41.84 billion at ~$70,666 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK $STRF $STRD strategy.com/press/strategy… 3:03 PM · Jun 16, 2025 6.1K Reply Copy link Read 777 replies Strategy has also insisted that it will not sell its coins anytime soon. Instead, the company is aiming to raise $84 billion to buy Bitcoin over time. A bullish case can be made for Bitcoin, as we wrote here . First, the world is running out of Bitcoin as the supply on exchanges plunge. There are now over 1.1 million coins on exchanges. While this is a big number, the supply stood at over 1.5 million in January and 3 million in 2021. Because of last year’s halving event, the number of Bitcoins being mined each day has crashed from 900 in April last year to 450 today. Companies like Strategy, MetaPlanet, and ETF issuers are buying all these coins. Therefore, the supply and demand dynamics mean that Bitcoin price will continue doing well in the long term. Michael Saylor believes that the coin will jump to $1 million in the near term and $5 million in the medium term. Ark Invest sees Bitcoin price surging to $2.4 million by the end of the year, while BlackRock sees it rising to $700,000. Therefore, if Bitcoin jumps to these levels, it means that the MSTR stock price will be higher even if the current premium ends. Bitcoin price technical analysis BTC price chart | Source: TradingView The long-term Bitcoin price chart points to more gains. It has formed a giant megaphone pattern, which is made up of two ascending and diverging trendlines. This is one of the most bullish patterns in technical analysis. Bitcoin price is attempting to break past the eight-year trendlines that connect the highest swings since December 17. It has also formed two large, rounded bottom patterns. Therefore, Bitcoin price will likely have a strong bullish breakout in the next few months. The initial target will be $150,000, followed by $200,000.

2025-06-18T15:57:07,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Dips As Trump’s Iran Threats Spark Macroeconomic Uncertainty","Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader crypto market tumbled on Tuesday as the conflict between Israel and Iran escalated. The US, under President Trump, has also taken a hardline stance, demanding the complete disarmament of Iran’s nuclear program. Trump also threatened Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. BTC has struggled this week, losing momentum after reaching an intraday high of $108,944. The flagship cryptocurrency plunged to a low of $103,395 before moving to current levels. Bitcoin (BTC) Tumbles After Trump’s Remarks Spark Panic Bitcoin tumbled after President Trump threatened Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, claiming the leader was an easy target as the US and its allies knew where he was hiding. Trump took to his social media platform, Truth Social, stating, “We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding. He is an easy target, but is safe there — We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now. We don’t want missiles shot at civilians or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” He also demanded Iran’s unconditional surrender. Trump’s comments come amid an escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. BTC dipped over $1,000 after Trump’s comments, dropping to a low of $103,395. Chinese Bitcoin ASIC Makers Bringing Production To The US Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT are set to begin US production as tariff pressures continue to grow. The three companies collectively produce nearly all of the world’s Bitcoin mining application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). The shift is in response to reciprocal tariffs imposed on China by US President Donald Trump. Chinese goods and services are subject to a 25% tariff after previously crossing 100%. Bitmain is responsible for 82% of Bitcoin ASIC production, while MicroBT accounts for 15% and Canaan around 2%. This gives them a combined 99% share of the global ASIC market. A study by the University of Cambridge noted, “The digital mining hardware market exhibits an oligopolistic structure, with the top three manufacturers — Bitmain, MicroBT, and Canaan — commanding over 99% market share.” This is not the first time geopolitics has impacted the Bitcoin mining industry. In early April, Hashlabs Mining CEO Jaran Mellerud had said that sweeping tariffs could lead to a collapse in demand for Bitcoin mining rigs in the US. Mellerud stated that tariffs would benefit mining operations based outside the US, as manufacturers would look to sell surplus inventory abroad at a lower cost. The Blockchain Group Adds To Bitcoin (BTC) Holdings Technology firm The Blockchain Group has added to its Bitcoin reserves, purchasing 182 BTC for around $19.6 million. The latest purchase takes the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 1,653 BTC , valued at around $170 million at current prices. The latest acquisition was funded by a series of recently completed convertible bond issuances of around 18 million euros ($20.7 million). Notable investors include UTXO Management, Moonlight Capital, TOBAM, and Ludovic Chechin-Laurans. According to the announcement, each investor purchased a different part of the company’s bond offerings. The Blockchain Group claimed a year-to-date Bitcoin yield of 1,173%, reflecting a notable increase in the ratio of Bitcoin held to its fully diluted share count. The company has added 469 BTC since the beginning of the year and reported over $49 million in gains in the value of its holdings. The acquisition cost stands at $103,000 per Bitcoin, lower than current market prices. The company is also planning to purchase an additional 70 BTC , which would take its holdings past 1,700 BTC . Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has rebounded to reclaim $105,000, with the price up nearly 1%, trading around $105,235. The flagship cryptocurrency has struggled to regain momentum after dropping from $110,000 last week as market sentiment flipped to bearish. As a result, it dipped to a low of $102,832 by Friday before recovering over the weekend. Analysts believe BTC still risks further downside but must stay above $102,000-$103,000 to remain on track for a potential recovery. Bitfinex analysts stated in a market report, “If Bitcoin can hold above the $102,000 - $103,000 region for a sustained period, it would suggest that the market is absorbing the selling pressure effectively.” They added that while some downside risk persists thanks to macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions, it presents a potentially risky yet rewarding opportunity for investors. “This environment now reflects a high-risk, high-reward opportunity for upside continuation if buyer confidence returns.” The analysts added that even if the price trends lower, the decline will not be as steep as seen during previous years. Some analysts presented a bleaker outlook, believing that current market and geopolitical conditions could push BTC below the psychological $100,000 price level. Some, like analyst Doctor Profit, believe the flagship cryptocurrency could retreat as low as $93,000. Markets were optimistic about BTC testing its all-time high after it surged past $110,000 last week. However, those hopes were dashed after Israel carried out airstrikes on Iran. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs continued to see strong inflows despite market uncertainty. BTC traded in positive territory over the previous weekend, rising nearly 3% and moving to $104,378 on Friday. Price action remained positive over the weekend as the flagship cryptocurrency rose 1.15% on Saturday and registered a marginal decline on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,784. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as BTC surged over 4% to cross the 20-day SMA and $110,000 to settle at $110,251. The price fell to an intraday low of $108,335 on Tuesday but recovered to reclaim $110,000 and settle at $110,253. BTC lost momentum on Wednesday, falling 1.42% and settling at $108,687. Source: TradingView Selling pressure intensified on Thursday as BTC fell nearly 3%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,828. The price plunged to an intraday low of $102,832 on Friday. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase, reclaim $106,000, and settle at $106,106. Price action was mixed over the weekend as BTC fell 0.59% on Saturday before registering a marginal rise on Sunday to settle at $105,562. BTC raced to an intraday high of $108,944 on Monday as it started the week positively. Despite the positive start, it could not stay at this level and settled at $106,806, ultimately registering an increase of 1.18%. Sentiment turned bearish on Tuesday thanks to the deteriorating situation in the Middle East. As a result, BTC fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $105,000 to settle at $104,518, but not before dropping to a low of $103,395.

2025-06-18T15:48:44,"Sberbank spearheads Russia’s AI ambition with GigaChat","Sberbank, Russia’s largest bank, is set to launch a version of its own Large Language Model (LLM), GigaChat, which is said to have advanced reasoning capabilities. First Deputy CEO Alexander Vedyakhin said in an interview that the model’s beta version is currently in testing and would be rolled out in the near future. Sberbank spearheads Russia’s AI ambition with GigaChat Most LLMs are primarily designed for chat and basic tasks; however, Sberbank claims that GigaChat features advanced reasoning capabilities, which make it capable of solving complex science and mathematical problems, and even code, making it on par with other models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT . Vedyakhin admits that the model is about six to nine months behind AI leaders like the US and China. However, he emphasized that GigaChat is tailored towards Russian language fluency, domestic cloud performance, and alignment with the local corporate needs. Vedyakhin believes this specialization makes GigaChat more valuable and preferred by Russian clients. He also claims that about 15,000 Russian companies are already adopting the model. Sberbank isn’t content with solo advances. In February 2025, Vedyakhin revealed plans to conduct joint research on AI projects with China. “Sberbank has many scientists. Through them, we plan to conduct joint research projects with researchers from China”. This was driven by Russia’s strategic “no limits” partnership and the emerging innovation of the low-cost LLM model, DeepSeek. The partnership also echoes Russia’s ambitions to enhance sovereignty and forge deeper ties with BRICS nations that are advanced in tech fields. Russia’s Roscosmos space corporation also plans to embed the GigaChat model into the International Space Station’s (ISS) IT systems. Roscosmos chief Dmitry Bakanov said the next ISS mission, planned for November 27, will deliver everything needed for the model integration. Bakanov said this will provide direct assistance for the cosmonauts, helping the crew process satellite imagery and increase image resolution. Sberbank is creating a hybrid tech-finance powerhouse Parallel to its AI drive, Sberbank is also taking a dive into the crypto market. In early June, it launched structured bonds, which are tied to the Bitcoin price and the USD/RUB exchange rates. The bonds are available over-the-counter (OTC) for qualified investors on the Moscow Stock Exchange. It also plans to launch more crypto exchange-traded products, including BTC futures. This move follows the Bank of Russia’s regulatory stance, which permits regulated crypto-based instruments for accredited investors. With the simultaneous dive into AI and crypto finance, Sberbank is positioning itself as an innovator in both emerging fields. It also reflects Russia’s efforts to reinforce its domestic capabilities and carve out its share in global technology. The coming months will reveal whether this pivot will pay off or stretch the bank thin in a highly competitive market, especially with the search engine Yandex, Sberbank’s main domestic rival in AI, saying its LLM has reasoning functionality.

2025-06-18T15:40:57,"Bitcoin: The Blockchain Group Achieves Milestone in BTC Holdings with Strategic Purchase","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: The Blockchain Group Achieves Milestone in BTC Holdings with Strategic Purchase In a move signaling growing corporate confidence in digital assets, The Blockchain Group, a French firm focused on blockchain technology, has significantly increased its Bitcoin holdings. This recent acquisition is part of a clear strategic pivot towards becoming a Bitcoin treasury company, placing them among a growing list of publicly traded entities embracing digital assets. Boosting The Blockchain Group’s BTC Holdings The core of this recent news revolves around a substantial purchase. The Blockchain Group acquired an additional 182 Bitcoin (BTC). This acquisition, valued at $19.6 million, brings their total reported BTC holdings to an impressive 1,653 Bitcoin. This isn’t just a minor addition; it represents a significant commitment and expansion of their digital asset reserves. The scale of this investment highlights the company’s belief in Bitcoin as a valuable asset for their corporate treasury. Increasing their BTC holdings by 182 coins demonstrates a proactive approach to managing their balance sheet in the current economic climate. Funding The Blockchain Group’s Bitcoin Strategy How did The Blockchain Group fund this notable purchase? According to reports, the $19.6 million acquisition was financed through a combination of convertible bonds and the conversion of share warrants. This approach indicates a deliberate financial strategy to acquire assets without solely relying on existing cash reserves, potentially leveraging future equity or debt structures. This funding method is also tied to a broader initiative announced earlier. On June 17, the firm revealed it had successfully raised $7.7 million. This capital raise was specifically earmarked to support its stated ambition: to transform into a Bitcoin treasury company . The recent Bitcoin purchase is a direct execution of this strategic fundraising and long-term vision. What is a Crypto Treasury Strategy? The term Crypto treasury strategy refers to a corporate finance approach where a company holds cryptocurrencies, primarily Bitcoin, on its balance sheet as a primary treasury reserve asset, alongside or instead of traditional assets like cash or gold. Companies adopting this strategy often view Bitcoin as: A hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. A potential store of value with long-term appreciation potential. A way to diversify corporate assets. A signal of innovation and forward-thinking in the digital economy. For The Blockchain Group , adopting this strategy means aligning their corporate finance with the very technology sector they operate within. It’s a bold move that positions them uniquely in the market. The Rise of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption The Blockchain Group’s move is part of a larger, undeniable trend: Institutional Bitcoin adoption . Over the past few years, we’ve seen a growing number of corporations, investment funds, and even some governments explore or actively acquire Bitcoin. Companies like MicroStrategy have become synonymous with this trend, holding vast amounts of Bitcoin on their balance sheets. This increasing Institutional Bitcoin adoption signifies a maturing market. It suggests that Bitcoin is moving beyond just individual retail investors and is being recognized by larger, more conservative financial players as a legitimate asset class. Each company that adds Bitcoin to its treasury validates this trend further. Why Companies Embrace Bitcoin: Benefits of BTC Holdings So, why are companies like The Blockchain Group deciding to accumulate significant BTC holdings ? The motivations are varied but often include: Inflation Hedge: With global central banks expanding monetary supply, companies seek assets perceived as scarce and resistant to devaluation. Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it an attractive option. Potential for Appreciation: Despite volatility, Bitcoin has historically shown significant long-term growth potential, offering the possibility of increasing the value of corporate reserves. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin provides diversification away from traditional financial assets which may be correlated with economic cycles or inflation risks. Balance Sheet Strength: For some, holding Bitcoin is seen as a way to strengthen the balance sheet and signal financial prudence in an uncertain economic environment. Alignment with Mission: For blockchain-focused companies like The Blockchain Group , holding Bitcoin aligns their financial strategy with their core business and values. Navigating the Challenges of a Bitcoin Treasury While the benefits are compelling, a Crypto treasury strategy is not without its challenges. Companies must navigate: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience dramatic swings, which can impact the reported value of corporate holdings and earnings.

2025-06-18T15:34:31,"Four U.S. Firms Commit $844M to Crypto Investments, Target Bitcoin and HYPE","At least four publicly traded companies in the U.S. announced a combined $844 million in fresh capital commitments toward cryptocurrencies on Tuesday, signaling a growing appetite for digital assets across diverse sectors. The largest contribution came from DDC Enterprise Ltd, which secured $528 million to aggressively build its Bitcoin (BTC) treasury . DDC raised the amount through a mix of a $300 million convertible note, a $200 million credit facility, and a $26 million equity investment. Major investors included Anson Funds and the venture capital arm of Animoca Brands. The company declared plans to acquire 5,000 BTC over the next three years, furthering its goal of building the “world’s most valuable Bitcoin treasury.” DDC had earlier purchased 21 BTC on May 23, marking its first foray into crypto by trading $2.28 million worth of equity. Fold and BitMine Expand Bitcoin Holdings Fold Holdings Inc., a Bitcoin financial services firm, said it secured a $250 million equity purchase facility. Proceeds will be primarily used to acquire additional BTC. If executed in full, the funds could add up to 2,390 BTC to Fold’s treasury at current market prices. Even a partial allocation would significantly bolster the firm’s current holding of 1,490 BTC. The funding agreement allows Fold to issue new shares through a private placement, pending SEC registration approval. Separately, BitMine Immersion Technologies, a Bitcoin mining equipment rental company, announced it had purchased $16.3 million worth of BTC using proceeds from a recent stock offering. The firm now owns 154.16 BTC, with an average purchase price of $106,033. BitMine said the acquisition aligns with a broader strategic pivot toward accumulating Bitcoin through both mining and capital raises. Eyenovia Bets Big on HYPE Token In a move that extends beyond Bitcoin, biotech firm Eyenovia revealed a $50 million private placement to acquire and stake Hyperliquid’s native HYPE token . The company plans to accumulate over 1 million HYPE tokens — currently worth around $40.1 million — and will stake them via Anchorage Digital. The company, which specializes in digital eye examination technology, also announced a full rebrand to “Hyperion DeFi” with the ticker symbol HYPD. It appointed Hyunsu Jung as Chief Investment Officer to lead its DeFi strategy. Jung called Hyperliquid “one of the fastest growing, highest-revenue generating blockchains in the world.” The post Four U.S. Firms Commit $844M to Crypto Investments, Target Bitcoin and HYPE appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",thecoinrise,https://thecoinrise.com/four-u-s-firms-commit-844m-to-crypto-investments-target-bitcoin-and-hype/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION","Bitcoin News|Bitcoin DDC|Crypto Treasury",cryptocompare
2025-06-18T15:30:55,"Altcoin Alert: Expert Reveals Hottest Opportunities For The Summer Season","As geopolitical tensions in the Middle East continue to impact cryptocurrency prices, with Bitcoin (BTC) recently dipping below the $105,000 mark, market analyst VirtualBacon has shared insights suggesting that altcoins are gearing up for a potentially robust summer. Emerging AI Memecoins In a recent update on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), he highlighted several promising developments within the altcoin space. VirtualBacon pointed to an emerging wave of AI-focused Layer-1 blockchain projects, many backed by prominent figures in both the cryptocurrency and traditional finance sectors. He mentioned several names to watch, including Sahara Labs, Sentient AGI, and Gaianet, among others. While these projects have yet to release tokens, many are expected to conduct airdrops or early access rounds, presenting opportunities for early investors. Related Reading: On-Chain Analyst Warns: Bitcoin Peak Expected, Altcoins Facing -95% Plunge For those seeking “higher-risk, high-reward investments,” VirtualBacon noted the impressive performance of artificial intelligence (AI) agent memecoins. He cited the launch of IRIS, which skyrocketed from a $220,000 fully diluted valuation (FDV) to $120 million, representing a 600x return. Platforms such as Virtuals, CreatorBid, and SeedifyFund are turning user engagement into allocation opportunities, likening this phenomenon to a form of airdrop farming on steroids. In addition, VirtualBacon highlighted a relatively overlooked area: Bittensor subnet tokens. He mentioned that seasoned investors can now acquire early-stage subnets directly on Bittensor’s chain, with projects like SN65_TPN and inference_labs raising capital through token auctions at valuations below $4 million. Stablecoins Take Center Stage Turning to real-world assets (RWAs), VirtualBacon advised focusing on mid-cap infrastructure projects with tangible revenue streams. He pointed to CHEX and CPOOL, which has shown consistent upward movement, as examples of promising investments. Another emerging narrative is the merger and acquisition activity involving public companies and crypto projects. VirtualBacon noted that Tron is set to go public through a Nasdaq reverse merger, while Mixie has been acquired by Netcapital, which boasts a team that includes notable figures like Tim Draper and a co-founder of Helium. A particularly intriguing development is World Liberty Financial (WLF), co-founded by Eric and Donald Jr. Trump, which aims to become a major player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. With plans for its own stablecoin, USD1, and expected to launch in October, the token could have an estimated FDV of $10–15 billion, a conservative projection given its potential. VirtualBacon also pointed out that stablecoins are becoming central to macroeconomic strategies. Tether now ranks as the fifth-largest holder of US Treasuries, highlighting the increasing need for buyers in the market. The analyst urged investors to keep an eye on stablecoin projects that integrate artificial intelligence technology and yield generation, such as USD1, Circle’s USDC, and others. Liquidity Shifts To Altcoin Platforms In the gaming sector, liquidity is coalescing around BlackholeDex, a decentralized exchange (DEX) backed by the AVAX Foundation. With a fee-sharing model similar to Aerodrome and Shadow, BlackholeDex has launched veNFT staking, aligning long-term incentives for users. Related Reading: Ethereum Slows Down In June: Historical Data Says More Losses To Come Lastly, in the Solana ecosystem, Saros DLMM is emerging as a strong competitor to existing platforms like Jupiter and Meteora, utilizing similar bucket-based liquidity pools but with lower fees. It also plans a RADY meme airdrop for SAROS stakers, which could attract early adopters and fuel rapid growth, thus closing the list of highlighted altcoins. As of this writing, Ethereum, the market’s leading altcoin, is trading at $2,521. It has consolidated above this level after dropping sharply from its two-week high of $2,878.

2025-06-18T15:30:26,"Bitcoin Reserve Bill Enters Ukrainian Parliament In Historic Move","Ukraine’s Verkhovna Rada has registered draft law No. 13356, a measure that would add “virtual assets” such as Bitcoin to the roster of instruments the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) may hold in its gold-and-foreign-currency reserves. The bill was filed on 10 June during the legislature’s 13th session of the ninth convocation and lists eight cross-party sponsors, including first deputy finance-committee chair Yaroslav Zheleznyak. The parliamentary bill card confirms that the Finance, Tax and Customs Policy Committee has been designated main rapporteur, with the Digital Transformation, Budget, Anti-Corruption and EU-Integration committees assigned as co-reviewers. Ukraine Introduces Bill To Add Bitcoin To NBU Reserves According to an explanatory note published by the LigaZakon legal portal, the draft would insert virtual assets into the list of internationally recognised reserve assets under the 1999 Law “On the National Bank of Ukraine.” It would also authorise three new channels for acquiring such assets—direct market purchases, acceptance of income denominated in virtual assets and borrowings of virtual assets from multilateral lenders or foreign central banks—and would permit their disposal either through open-market sales for monetary-policy purposes or through repayment of virtual-asset liabilities to official creditors. Zheleznyak emphasises that the language is permissive rather than compulsory. “We give the National Bank the right to include virtual assets in Ukraine’s reserves. How, when and how much is left entirely to the regulator,” he told Korrespondent.net after the filing, adding that the proposal “does not oblige” the NBU but positions Ukraine “within global financial innovation.” In a separate comment to business daily LIGA.net he stressed that timing, method and volume would remain “the discretion of the central bank,” reiterating that the bill is written broadly on purpose. The full text of the bill has yet to be posted on the Rada portal; several Ukrainian legal outlets note that the PDF remains inaccessible as of 18 June. Nonetheless, the outline now before committees is the clearest legislative attempt to date to give the NBU explicit authority to hold Bitcoin alongside its existing reserve assets—monetary gold, IMF Special Drawing Rights, foreign-currency cash, and high-grade securities. Ukraine’s international reserves stood at $44.53 billion on 1 June, according to the NBU data cited by Sudova Yurydychna Hazeta. Supporters argue that allowing a crypto component would diversify that stockpile and could serve as a back-up settlement rail if wartime disruptions sever traditional channels. If enacted, Kyiv would join a very small group of sovereigns whose law explicitly permits Bitcoin to be held as a reserve asset; El Salvador , which disclosed a strategic holding of just over 6,200 BTC, remains the only country currently reporting such positions. Under Rada procedure the draft now awaits a first-reading recommendation from the Finance Committee, after which it can be scheduled for plenary debate. No timetable has been announced, but the bill’s cross-factional sponsorship and the absence of immediate objections from the central bank suggest the proposal will receive serious consideration in the coming months.

2025-06-18T15:30:09,"K33 Secures $8.88M for Ambitious Bitcoin Acquisition","BitcoinWorld K33 Secures $8.88M for Ambitious Bitcoin Acquisition In the ever-evolving world of digital assets, a significant trend continues to gain momentum: companies strategically adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. This isn’t just for tech giants anymore. Recently, Swedish Crypto Broker , K33, formerly known as Skilling, made waves with an announcement that underscores this growing institutional confidence in the leading cryptocurrency. K33 is embarking on a substantial BTC Acquisition plan, aiming to purchase up to 1,000 BTC, funded by a successful capital raise. What is K33’s Bold Bitcoin Acquisition Plan? K33, a prominent player in the Nordic crypto market, recently revealed its ambitious plan to significantly increase its holdings of the flagship digital asset. The company announced on its official website a successful fundraising round, securing SEK 85 million, which translates to approximately $8.88 million USD. This capital was raised through a directed share issue, a common method for companies to quickly raise funds by selling shares directly to selected investors. The primary stated purpose of this substantial capital injection is to finance the firm’s strategic goal of acquiring up to 1,000 Bitcoin . At current market prices, 1,000 BTC represents a considerable asset base, potentially valued in the tens of millions of dollars, depending on the exact timing and price of the purchases. This move signals a strong conviction from K33 ‘s leadership in the long-term value proposition of Bitcoin. The decision to fund this BTC Acquisition through a share issue indicates investor support for K33 ‘s strategic direction. It allows the company to use external capital rather than existing operational funds to build its Bitcoin reserves, potentially preserving liquidity for other business needs. Why Would a Crypto Broker Pursue Corporate Crypto Holdings? One might ask why a Crypto Broker , whose core business is facilitating crypto trading for clients, would want to hold a significant amount of Bitcoin on its own balance sheet. This strategic decision is multifaceted and aligns with broader trends in Corporate Crypto adoption. Several key reasons likely underpin K33 ‘s move: Balance Sheet Strength and Asset Diversification: Holding Bitcoin can be seen as a way to diversify the company’s treasury assets beyond traditional fiat currencies and investments. Given Bitcoin’s potential for appreciation, it could enhance the overall value and strength of the company’s balance sheet over time. Long-Term Conviction in Bitcoin: As a Crypto Broker , K33 is deeply embedded in the crypto ecosystem. Holding Bitcoin signals a strong belief in its future as a store of value and a global reserve asset. This aligns their corporate strategy with the asset class they serve. Enhanced Credibility and Trust: By holding a substantial amount of Bitcoin , K33 demonstrates to its clients and the market that it has ‘skin in the game.’ This can build trust and credibility, showing they are not just facilitating trading but are also participants and believers in the market’s long-term potential. Potential for New Products and Services: A significant BTC Acquisition could potentially pave the way for K33 to offer new financial products or services backed by their Bitcoin holdings, although the announcement specifically mentions treasury purposes. This strategy positions K33 not just as a facilitator but also as an active participant in the Corporate Crypto movement. Understanding the Mechanics: Funding the BTC Acquisition The SEK 85 million ($8.88 million) was raised through a directed share issue. This means that new shares of K33 were created and sold directly to a pre-selected group of investors, rather than through a public offering. This method is often faster and more efficient for companies needing to raise capital quickly for specific purposes, like a significant asset purchase. The funds raised from this share issue will provide the capital needed for the planned BTC Acquisition . K33 will then use this cash to purchase Bitcoin on the open market or through over-the-counter (OTC) desks, aiming to accumulate up to 1,000 BTC. The execution of this purchase will depend on market conditions and K33 ‘s trading strategy to minimize price impact and acquire the asset efficiently. It’s important to note that the value of the acquired Bitcoin will fluctuate with market prices, introducing volatility to K33 ‘s balance sheet. However, the decision to proceed suggests that K33 and its investors are comfortable with this volatility, viewing Bitcoin as a long-term holding rather than a short-term speculation. What are the Potential Benefits for K33? Embarking on this significant BTC Acquisition strategy offers several potential upsides for K33 : Asset Appreciation: If the price of Bitcoin increases over time, the value of K33 ‘s holdings will grow, positively impacting the company’s net worth and potentially its share price. Increased Market Confidence: This move can be perceived positively by the market, signaling that K33 is confident in the future of the asset class it operates within. This could attract more clients and investors. Enhanced Brand Positioning: Holding substantial Bitcoin reserves strengthens K33 ‘s position as a serious and committed player in the crypto space, differentiating it from brokers who might only facilitate trading without holding significant assets themselves. Potential Hedging: For a Crypto Broker , holding Bitcoin could potentially act as a hedge against certain market dynamics or regulatory shifts, though this is a complex consideration. These benefits are contingent on the performance of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Are There Challenges or Risks Involved? While the potential benefits are clear, a significant BTC Acquisition also comes with inherent risks, especially for a publicly traded company like K33 : Market Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price swings. A significant downturn in the Bitcoin price could negatively impact the value of K33 ‘s holdings and its overall financial performance. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and companies holding them is still evolving in many jurisdictions, including Sweden and the broader EU. Changes in regulations could impact the value or usability of K33 ‘s Bitcoin holdings. Execution Risk: Acquiring a large amount like 1,000 BTC requires careful execution to avoid significant price impact during the purchase process. Shareholder Reaction: While the share issue was successful, the long-term reaction of shareholders to K33 ‘s performance will be tied, in part, to the performance of its Bitcoin reserves. Managing these risks will be crucial for K33 as it integrates this Corporate Crypto strategy. How Does K33’s Move Compare to Other Corporate Crypto Strategies? Corporate Crypto adoption gained significant attention with companies like MicroStrategy making massive BTC Acquisition s, positioning Bitcoin as their primary treasury reserve asset. Tesla also made headlines with its Bitcoin purchase, although its strategy has been more dynamic. While K33 ‘s target of 1,000 BTC is smaller in scale compared to MicroStrategy’s hundreds of thousands of BTC, its significance lies in the nature of the company. K33 is a Crypto Broker – a company whose very existence is tied to the digital asset market. Their decision to hold substantial Bitcoin on their balance sheet is arguably a stronger endorsement of the asset class than that of a software company or an electric vehicle manufacturer. It reflects a belief that holding the underlying asset is a core part of being a Crypto Broker in the modern financial landscape. This move might encourage other crypto-native companies to consider similar strategies. Here’s a simple comparison: Company Primary Business Approx. BTC Holdings (as of late data/announcement) Funding Method (for BTC) MicroStrategy Business Intelligence Software ~220,000+ BTC Debt issuance, Equity offerings, Cash flows Tesla Electric Vehicles, Energy ~10,000+ BTC (fluctuates) Cash flows K33 Crypto Broker Target: up to 1,000 BTC Directed Share Issue (Note: BTC holdings are approximate and change frequently.) This table highlights that while the scale differs, the intent – integrating Bitcoin into the corporate treasury – is a shared strategic goal across different types of companies engaging in Corporate Crypto . Actionable Insights: What Can Investors Learn from This K33 Strategy? The K33 announcement provides several insights for both institutional and retail investors interested in the crypto market: Confirmation of Institutional Interest: This move further validates the trend of companies viewing Bitcoin as a legitimate treasury asset. It’s not just a few outliers; the movement is broadening. Belief in Long-Term Value: Companies making significant BTC Acquisition s, funded by external capital, are signaling a strong long-term bullish outlook on Bitcoin . They are willing to take on the volatility risk for potential future gains. Diversification Strategy: The rationale behind Corporate Crypto adoption often includes diversification. Investors might consider how digital assets could fit into their own diversified portfolios. Focus on Crypto-Native Companies: For investors looking for exposure to companies directly involved in the crypto space, examining the balance sheet strategies of Crypto Broker s and exchanges can be informative. K33 ‘s strategy is one example. While K33 ‘s specific situation is unique to its business model and market position, the underlying motivations and strategic considerations are relevant to understanding the broader trend of Corporate Crypto adoption. In conclusion, K33 ‘s successful $8.88 million raise to fund the purchase of up to 1,000 Bitcoin is a notable development in the Corporate Crypto space. It highlights the increasing confidence of companies, especially those within the digital asset industry, in holding Bitcoin as a strategic treasury asset. This move by a prominent Crypto Broker like K33 not only strengthens its own position but also serves as another data point in the ongoing institutional adoption narrative surrounding Bitcoin .

2025-06-18T15:28:38,"Best Crypto To Buy Now As EU’s Bearish View On Bitcoin Starts to Fade","While Asia and the U.S. have taken turns fueling bull cycles, the European Union, long regarded as one of crypto’s most skeptical zones, is now stepping into the arena with real intent. For years, hesitation ruled policy. Now, the hesitation is fading. What’s being introduced now is a framework designed not to restrict crypto, but to regulate it into the mainstream. With clear licensing pathways, unified passporting rights, and accelerating approvals for top-tier exchanges, the EU is positioning itself as a serious contender in the next phase of crypto growth. What was once a fortress of red tape is quickly becoming one of crypto’s most strategic gateways. Across continents, institutional adoption is accelerating, and governments that once dismissed crypto outright are now establishing frameworks to bring it into the mainstream. It’s visible in the pace of approvals, licensing, and market access granted to some of the world’s largest crypto exchanges. The EU Greenlights Crypto’s Next Phase of Expansion For years, Europe’s relationship with crypto was defined by caution and constraint. That posture has changed. Since the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation officially came into effect, the speed at which top exchanges have begun establishing a legal presence inside the bloc has surprised even longtime industry watchers. Malta and other jurisdictions have moved quickly to approve licenses for Gemini, Crypto.com, and OKX; companies that represent massive volumes of daily trading activity. These aren’t fringe players; they are foundational pillars of the global crypto economy. Coinbase is now finalizing entry through Luxembourg, a move that underscores the new priority status the EU is commanding. MiCA is coming into full force by the end of June.Not just for exchanges or stablecoins, but for anyone building infrastructure for tokenized assets in Europe.MiCA = Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation.It became law in the EU last year. Parts are already in force, like… — Dusk (@DuskFoundation) June 12, 2025 The deeper significance lies in the mechanics. Under MiCA, any exchange approved in one EU country can legally offer services across all 27 member states. This passporting effect radically simplifies expansion and removes the need to battle with inconsistent national rules. For large exchanges, this opens the door to a highly banked, economically mature, and regulation-first population, all of which are ideal conditions for crypto adoption at scale. Beyond just access, the EU has reinforced its stance with coordinated enforcement rules, standardized anti-money laundering procedures, and a formal crypto tax reporting framework through CARF. Rather than pushing exchanges away with ambiguous policy, the EU is now offering the one thing the crypto sector has long craved: legal clarity paired with market opportunity. If momentum continues at this pace, the European crypto market won’t just grow. It could become the most professionally regulated in the world. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Tokens that Could Attract the European Investor-Base Solaxy Solaxy is simply building the bridge the current crypto infrastructure desperately needs, one that connects Solana’s speed and Ethereum’s reach under a single layer. For investors and developers within the European Union, this approach holds particular appeal. As the MiCA framework begins to shape the future of compliant blockchain operations across the continent, Solaxy’s architecture answers a very real demand: performance without compromise. Speed without security risks, and compatibility without chaos. Europe’s crypto evolution will not be driven by hype coins or experimental chains. It will be built on ecosystems that can support both institutional onboarding and public utility. That is where Solaxy shines. Its network is fast, cost-efficient, and engineered to handle high-volume transactions, making it a prime choice for both consumer-facing apps and backend enterprise infrastructure. It's time to break out the fireworks. 🛸🪐54M Raised! 🔥 pic.twitter.com/j4o0a6bqDn — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) June 17, 2025 The project is already enroute to being listed across top exchanges, since the ongoing presale is likely to end soon, having raised $54 million at the time of writing. From a regulatory perspective, Solaxy has the bones to thrive under scrutiny. Its focus on verifiable on-chain activity, auditable data structures, and smart contract transparency aligns neatly with what European policymakers are looking to reward. If European exchanges begin curating assets based on long-term viability and technical maturity, Solaxy is the kind of token that passes both tests. Its cross-chain capability means it is not confined to one camp. It pulls liquidity and users from multiple ecosystems, positioning it as a foundational layer rather than a single-use play. In a region that now favors structured expansion over speculative chaos, Solaxy offers exactly the kind of clarity that could bring long-term capital into its fold. SUBBD SUBBD is being built as a cultural creator-themed movement. As Europe's content economy explodes across platforms, creators are seeking more than just visibility. They are searching for sovereignty. SUBBD provides it in the most direct way possible; by turning audience support into tokenized income, without relying on a central platform to handle the flow. Unlike social apps that dictate payout cycles or censor content based on opaque policies, SUBBD allows creators to own their audience and monetize their output through a decentralized platform. For the EU, which is tightening its stance on platform accountability and creator rights, this is more than just a crypto use case. It is a digital policy solution waiting to be scaled. Its smart-contract framework allows for transparent payments, dynamic pricing models, and layered subscription tiers, all of which meet the growing demand for fair digital labor practices. The content economy in the EU is massive, but fragmented. SUBBD offers the infrastructure to unify that market across borders, backed by code instead of bureaucracy. The project’s potential was highlighted by popular crypto YouTuber ClayBro in one of his videos as well. With MiCA opening the gates for compliant innovation, platforms like SUBBD that focus on clear user identity verification, revenue tracking, and localized governance have a real opportunity to thrive. Whether it is used by influencers in Berlin or educators in Barcelona, the mechanics remain the same. A creator produces, while an audience pays. There is no platform gatekeeping and no surprise suspensions. Just direct digital ownership. In the post-MiCA Europe, SUBBD’s model may become the blueprint, not the exception. Best Wallet Token The importance of a reliable crypto wallet cannot be overstated, especially in a region like the EU where regulations are no longer speculative but active. Best Wallet Token is positioning itself not just as a tool for users, but as a central access point for an increasingly compliance-focused digital economy. In a landscape where every transaction may need to meet KYC, tax, and reporting standards, Best Wallet is not just relevant. It is necessary. Best Wallet is built for the modern crypto user. It integrates fiat onboarding, secure multi-asset storage, and cross-chain functionality, all in a format that feels intuitive even to those new to the space. This is crucial in the EU, where retail participation is high, but so are regulatory demands. Users want to engage, but they need platforms that can guarantee transparency, security, and support if things go wrong. Best Wallet delivers on all fronts. Its token is not a gimmick. It plays a central role in enabling in-app utilities, from transaction fee discounts to governance rights, and staking for advanced features. As more exchanges move into the EU, Best Wallet could become their preferred retail partner, offering an off-the-shelf custody solution that meets local requirements without sacrificing user experience. More importantly, it fits the EU’s new direction: accessible, compliant, and easy to scale. For investors looking at infrastructure plays instead of just narrative coins, Best Wallet Token represents the kind of utility-first product that could ride Europe’s crypto wave for years. Conclusion As the European Union transitions from skepticism to structured support, the playing field is changing fast. For investors, this marks a rare moment where macro-level policy shifts align with project-level readiness. The kinds of crypto assets that can thrive in this new environment are not just speculative plays. They are built for functionality, speed, compliance, and market fit. The tokens and platforms positioned to benefit most are those that understand what the next chapter of crypto adoption actually looks like. It will not be driven by hype cycles or social media noise. It will be driven by infrastructure, retail access, developer flexibility, and seamless integration into financial and digital ecosystems. Europe is finally ready for that shift, and the projects mentioned above represent some of the most compelling opportunities for those looking to take advantage of it. At press time its also rumored Donald Trump is in peace talks with Iran, mentioning ‘nothing is too late’ and that Iran has ‘reached out’ to him.

At this point, attention today turned to the FED decision, an important macro event that could determine the short-term direction of Bitcoin. After January, when the FED kept interest rates constant, dollar, gold, stock market and cryptocurrency investors are wondering when the first interest rate cut of 2025 will be made. When Will the June FED Interest Rate Decision Be Announced? The FED will announce its June interest rate decision on May 18, 2025 at 21:00 Turkish time. Following the decision, FED Chairman Jerome Powell will make oral statements at 21:30. What Will the FED's Decision Be? Despite inflation in the US falling to 2.4 percent and President Donald Trump's calls for drastic interest rate cuts, the Fed is not expected to make any changes to interest rates. While the overwhelming majority of the market, 99.9%, expects the FED to keep the policy rate constant between 4.25% and 4.50%, only a small portion, 0.1%, expects interest rates to be reduced to 4.00% and 4.25%. In general, experts expect the Fed to remain cautious despite the decline in inflation, amid ongoing uncertainty over tariffs and tensions in the Middle East. Atlanta FED President Raphael Bostic, drawing attention to the uncertainties in the economic outlook, said that they need a period of 3 to 6 months to make a more accurate assessment. BoF Does Not Expect a Cut from FED! Bank of America economist Aditya Bhave said the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged in June and will not make any cuts this year. However, the analyst added that they left the door open to a decision to cut only one rate in 2025. “The Fed's main message at its June meeting will be that it remains comfortably committed to a wait-and-see mode. Ongoing uncertainties are preventing interest rate cuts. “Investors should focus on Powell's assessment of softening labor data, recent benign inflation data, and persistent inflation risks from tariffs.” In light of all these statements and according to current pricing in money markets, the FED is expected to make its first interest rate cut in September 2025. A total of 2 interest rate cuts are expected by the end of the year. Powell Statements Are Very Important! While it is unlikely that the FED will make a surprise rate cut as expected, signals from the policy text and Powell's statements are expected to have an impact on the direction of the markets. At this point, Powell's stance on inflation, growth and interest rate cuts will guide the Bitcoin and crypto markets. Experts say Powell is cornered and that Powell and the FED have a difficult choice to make. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-18T14:55:48,"Trump’s Truth Social Eyes SEC Nod for BTC-ETH ETF Launch","Donald Trump's Truth Social website has once again made headlines, this time filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to list a first-ever dual Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). The new fund, supported by Yorkville America Digital, aims to give investors exposure to BTC and ETH in a single regulated product—a daring move that comes just months before the 2025 presidential election and when crypto policy just so happens to be a hot campaign issue. In the Dual-Asset ETF Structure Unlike the single-asset ETFs that have dominated U.S. markets since 2024, the Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF would allocate 75% of its investments to Bitcoin and 25% to Ether, according to the S-1 filing. The fund's shares would be directly supported by BTC and ETH held in custody with Foris DAX Trust Company, doing business as Crypto.com. This product aims to simplify access for traditional investors, allowing them to diversify between the two largest cryptocurrencies without having to handle individual products or wallets. The ETF will trade on NYSE Arca, though the final ticker and cash custodian details are not yet known. Truth Social's filing also indicates that it plans to file further amendments, including a summary of its agency agreement with Crypto.com, which will also be providing trading execution, staking, and liquidity services for the fund. Election-Year Tailwinds and Political Calculus The timing of the filing is not coincidental. Trump Media's ETF attempt follows the SEC's approval of a $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury plan for the firm, and as Trump himself has focused crypto in his campaign messaging. By leveraging the Truth Social brand and user base, the ETF could potentially attract a politically engaged retail group and help to further establish Trump as a crypto-friendly candidate. Analysts add that the ETF's launch could serve as a rallying point for crypto-friendly voters, especially with the Biden administration coming under criticism for regulatory uncertainty in the space. The move also comes as other issuers, including BlackRock and Fidelity, still dominate the single-asset ETF space, with Truth Social's dual-asset approach being a differentiation. How It Compares to Single-Asset Funds Most U.S. crypto ETFs are focused exclusively on Bitcoin or, more recently, Ethereum. Truth Social's product is unique in that it offers both assets under the same roof, which could appeal to investors seeking diversification without the burden of holding multiple funds. While the SEC has already approved several dual-asset ETFs, like the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF, none have been paired with a high-profile political brand or social media site. The twin structure would also have a tendency to smooth out volatility as Bitcoin and Ether move in tandem but can decouple during periods of market stress or protocol upgrades. The fund's direct custody model, with Crypto.com as the trusted provider, is designed to provide assurance to investors of asset security—an issue that has dogged some earlier ETF launches. Will the SEC Say Yes? Legal professionals state that the chances of approval are higher than they would've been a year ago, due to the SEC's recent approvals of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Nevertheless, the Truth Social ETF's prominent political affiliations and twin-asset structure may attract additional attention. Some analysts caution that possible conflicts of interest—due to Trump's ownership in both the media firm and the ETF sponsor—may be a point of contention during the SEC's review process. However, the regulatory winds appear to be shifting. The SEC has been willing to approve new crypto products, provided they have robust transparency and surveillance mechanisms in place. The involvement of well-established partners like Yorkville America Digital and Crypto.com could also serve to reinforce the ETF's bid. “Given the SEC’s recent approvals, a dual Bitcoin-Ether ETF now has a real shot—especially in an election year where crypto is front and center,” — ETF legal analyst, June 2025 What's Next for Truth Social's ETF Bid? With the S-1 filed and the NYSE Arca listing application pending, the SEC's court now has the ball. Barring approval, the Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF could launch as soon as Q4 2025 into a growing crypto investment product market. Meanwhile, both investors and political pundits will be monitoring the SEC's next step—and the potential ripple effects on both the crypto markets and the campaign trail. The Bottom Line Truth Social's double bid for Bitcoin and Ether ETFs is a gamble that combines political branding with financial innovation. With the SEC ruling, the outcome could set a precedent for both crypto regulation and the intersection of digital assets with U.S. politics.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9615/trump-s-truth-social-eyes-sec-nod-for-btc-eth-etf-launch,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION","News|Business",cryptocompare
2025-06-18T14:54:30,"Shanghai’s new e-CNY hub marks China’s subtle play for global monetary influence","Shanghai’s new e-CNY operations center is China’s answer to the stablecoin-led disruption of cross-border finance, signaling that the digital yuan isn’t just for domestic trials anymore, but for an open audition on the global economic stage. On June 18, People’s Bank of China Governor Pan Gongsheng took the stage at Shanghai’s Lujiazui Forum to unveil what may become the digital yuan’s most consequential maneuver yet. Among eight sweeping reforms, the establishment of an e-CNY international operations center stood out, designed to pilot blockchain-based trade finance tools and streamline cross-border settlements. Pan was deliberate in his speech . While acknowledging that stablecoins and CBDCs are “reshaping traditional payment infrastructure,” he positioned the digital yuan as something distinct: a state-backed alternative that leverages blockchain’s efficiency while rejecting its decentralization ethos. You might also like: GENIUS Act could bring trillions in institutional crypto capital: experts weigh in From domestic trials to global playbook The establishment of Shanghai’s international e-CNY hub is more than just a pilot program. It marks China recalibrating its digital currency strategy in the face of slowing domestic traction and a shifting global financial order. Despite four years of pilots across 29 cities, the digital yuan remains a niche product within China’s vast payment ecosystem. As of mid-2025, e-CNY transactions accounted for just 0.16% of China’s total payment volume, dwarfed by Alipay and WeChat Pay, which dominate daily commerce. Even state-backed incentives, like expiring cash airdrops to spur usage, have failed to shift consumer habits. Yet, Beijing isn’t retreating, it’s pivoting. China views CBDCs as a long-term infrastructure play, not a quick retail win. The Shanghai hub signals a shift in focus from convincing street vendors to accept e-CNY to rewriting the rules of cross-border trade finance. In his speech, Pan tied the digital yuan to a broader vision of monetary multipolarity, where no single currency dominates global trade and finance: “The development of the international monetary system towards multipolarity will help promote sovereign currency countries to strengthen policy constraints, enhance the resilience of the international monetary system, and more effectively maintain global economic and financial stability.” Pan said in a translated statement. The governor made clear this isn’t just about currency politics. He emphasized how emerging technologies enable faster payment settlements. By integrating smart contracts into cross-border transactions, China aims to harness blockchain’s speed while maintaining centralized oversight. This hybrid approach targets stablecoins’ core appeal, instant settlements, while rejecting what Pan described as their “insufficient regulatory oversight.” The gamble? That developing economies will trade crypto’s openness for China’s promise of dollar-free, real-time infrastructure.

2025-06-18T14:47:59,"Interview: XRP a great hedge and alternative to other top 10 digital assets, says 3iQ CEO Pascal St-Jean","XRP, the cryptocurrency associated with Ripple, is witnessing a sharp rally. Since January 2015, XRP’s price has surged from just $0.02 to over $2.19 — a staggering increase of more than 10,800%. The latest rally is being fuelled by a confluence of factors: rising optimism around a potential resolution to the ongoing SEC lawsuit, which saw Ripple’s fine cut from $125 million to $50 million in a proposed joint settlement motion; increased institutional interest; and the beginning of a wave of XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) launches. On Wednesday, prominent Canada-based alternative asset manager 3iQ launched its XRP ETF — trading under the tickers XRPQ and XRPQ.U — on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Ripple is an early investor in the fund. XRPQ is one of the first ETFs in North America to offer direct exposure to XRP, currently the third-largest digital asset by market capitalization. The move closely follows Purpose Investments’ debut of Canada’s first spot XRP ETF, highlighting growing demand for regulated XRP investment vehicles. “XRP has demonstrated significant growth potential over the past decade, and this groundbreaking strategy offers Canadian and qualified global investors a transparent, low-cost and tax-efficient way to securely access that opportunity. Ripple Labs’ investment support reflects our shared leadership in advancing the digital asset space,” Pascal St-Jean, President and CEO of 3iQ, said. Invezz spoke with St-Jean to learn more about 3iQ’s decision to include XRP in its offerings, key trends shaping the crypto market, the firm’s investment positioning, and his perspective on ETH’s institutional role. Excerpts: How XRP differs from BTC, ETH, and SOL and why it is a great hedge? Invezz: You have just launched the 3iQ XRP ETF, what led you to add this digital asset to your existing suite of ETFs that include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana? Retail demand remains high for XRP in our view. What’s fascinating about XRP and XRPL is that the launch, development, and marketing for the technology is very centralized – a stark contrast to BTC, ETH, SOL, and others through Ripple Labs and its foundation. This approach is so radically different than those seen in other decentralized protocols that we see some investors actually prefer there to be “faces to the name”, and the ability for the technology to market and develop the XRPL directly to institutions and governments. They have an ambitious goal to replace the SWIFT system, which is something compelling that may be made possible by a known, centralized business rather than a decentralized protocol. We see it as a great hedge and alternative to other digital assets in the Top 10 by market capitalization. Bitcoin’s dominant performance to lead to adoption of other digital assets Invezz: What are some of the trends in the crypto market that you are taking note of, and how is 3iQ positioning its investments? One of the most significant trends we’ve noted throughout this cycle is Bitcoin’s dominant performance. This dominance can largely be attributed to two key factors: the increasing institutional adoption of Bitcoin and the rise of public Bitcoin treasury companies. These developments are incredibly positive for the entire digital asset space, as they lend considerable legitimacy and bring substantial capital into the ecosystem. We believe this institutional engagement with Bitcoin will naturally lead to a trickle-down effect into other high-quality digital assets. We are already seeing clear evidence of this, with more and more institutions actively seeking to educate themselves on Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) now that they have a foundational understanding and comfort level with Bitcoin. Beyond asset-specific trends, we are observing a crucial overarching development: regulatory clarity is rapidly becoming more aligned on a global scale. The proactive stance of the USA in fast-tracking crypto as a priority is having a ripple effect, with other significant economies, such as Japan, actively preparing to open up their markets to digital assets. This increasing regulatory certainty is vital for institutional participation and further legitimizes the industry. 3iQ is exceptionally well-positioned to navigate this evolving landscape, as we have established footprints in multiple jurisdictions, allowing us to adapt and grow as frameworks solidify worldwide. Hedge fund world in crypto seeing increasing migration of talent from TradFi Furthermore, a powerful trend we’ve been closely observing, and indeed acted upon, is the migration of top-tier talent from traditional finance (TradFi) into the crypto space, particularly within the hedge fund world. This inflow of experienced professionals brings invaluable expertise and a sophisticated understanding of market dynamics to digital asset investing. Recognizing this as a key accelerant for the industry, 3iQ was a pioneering firm in building a dedicated managed account platform, which we call QMAP. This platform was specifically designed to cater to the needs of these sophisticated investors and allows for flexible, institutionally-compliant access to digital asset strategies. These trends, encompassing institutional adoption, clearer regulation, and the influx of TradFi talent, are not just happening; they are accelerating. At 3iQ, our investment strategy is built on recognizing and capitalizing on these evolving market dynamics. For instance, we launched North America’s first publicly traded Bitcoin and Ether funds, and more recently, the 3iQ Solana Staking ETF (SOLQ). This focus on providing regulated, secure, and accessible investment vehicles for leading digital assets allows us to cater to the growing institutional appetite while offering opportunities for both capital appreciation and, in the case of staking-enabled products, yield generation. Stablecoins seen as portfolio components but regulation is key Invezz : Stablecoins are piquing institutional interest from JPMorgan to PayPal to Uber also looking to adopt it. Tokenised assets are seeing rise in interest too. How do you view their potential as portfolio components or competitors to your existing offerings? We certainly see them as portfolio components. Stablecoins are an excellent example of public blockchains in action. Centralized corporate issuers are now able to launch their own versions of a digital dollar, while keeping them fungible and interoperable with competitors. These issuers can choose to mobilize their equivalent USD holdings in securities like T-bills and retain or pass through these earnings. However, regulations are key here and we expect the GENIUS act in the US to accelerate this crypto use case, just like MiCA regulations are doing in the EU. 3iQ already incorporates stablecoins in a variety of business activities and within some of our fund operations. Why ETH is internet’s ‘trust machine’ and can be a good institutional asset Invezz : Ethereum’s post-merge narrative has shifted towards staking and programmability. What’s your view on ETH as an institutional asset post the merge? Ethereum is the internet’s trust machine. Including all its major tokens, layer 2 networks, stablecoins, and corporate economy systems. It’s by far the most adopted technology today. The total economic value being settled on Ethereum today rivals G20 countries, yet it remains fully decentralized and adopted by many in countries with opposing views. The network has never been hacked or sustained downtime, yet it has maintained credible neutrality in a world that has been surrounded by anything but. Ethereum’s current architecture allows for any entity to create its own systems, financial or not, which each require financial trust, assurance, and interoperability on the modern internet. Demand for ether (ETH) will come from increasing demand for Ethereum’s role in the modern internet. Programmability on Ethereum allows for corporate entities to develop their own circular, native internet economies and currencies, including stablecoins. Ultimately, we see ETH as an economic imperative for businesses wishing to excel in an environment where artificial intelligence hyper-financializes and dramatically shifts legacy trust systems (inc. government systems., legal systems, corporate systems, etc.). ETH could be a compelling institutional asset as its token distribution from an early inception in July 2015 and current adoption rate are favourable, while proposing solutions to long-term chain security, including quantum computing, and its network consensus health. If there’s anything closest to a digital nation state, then Ethereum is it, and 3iQ are huge believers in the technology. Cayman and Japan next in 3iQ’s expansion plan Invezz : You partnered with Monex group which is now your majority owner, and continue to increase your partnerships globally, such as with Criptonite Asset Management in Switzerland and AltNovel in the UAE. What are other international markets that you are eyeing? Our journey began in Canada, and we are truly grateful for the clients, relationships, and business that we have built out here. However, it is difficult to build a business that relies on a single regulatory body. Budgeting for new initiatives and forecasting future revenue is a near-impossible task. Expanding to other jurisdictions beyond Canada is both opportunistic and adds resilience and diversification. We have begun speaking with major institutions in these jurisdictions with real capital, waiting to allocate. The next frontier for 3iQ following Switzerland and the UAE will be Cayman and eventually Japan, leveraging off our parent company Monex who are one of Japan’s most respected financial services institutions. Asset managers playing an increasing role in staking; see it as a feature of institutional portfolios Invezz: You were early in launching staking within regulated fund structures. Do you see staking yields as a long-term feature of institutional portfolios? Yes. Asset managers play an increasing role in supporting the consensus and governance of blockchains, which is what staking implies. Staking is a duty involving running the blockchain software and voting and attesting to blockchains, and signalling support for network state changes. We are trusted by our clients to custody and hold crypto assets on a diverse range of networks. This, by nature, implies we are important users of the blockchain and therefore have a fiduciary responsibility to represent our clients in consensus matters. In terms of yields, asset managers have the opportunity to outperform competitors, so we believe there is a lot of opportunity to outperform others in a way that is more technology-related than purely financial. This is where deep crypto asset expertise plays a role. It is certainly a feature of institutional portfolios as managers are incentivized to outperform holding the raw asset in question. Regulations bringing clarity to digital assets; pensions also actively exploring the sector Invezz: What’s the biggest barrier today for institutions still hesitant about entering digital assets? Is it volatility, custody, compliance or something else? Until now, it has been a toxic cocktail of uncertainty around regulatory status, tax treatment, and lack of institutional custody solutions known to the institutional investors (i.e. Northern Trust, BONY, State Street). In addition, consultants have been reluctant to embrace the asset class for various reasons. In the last 6 months, there has been a noticeable shift with regulators bringing more clarity to the digital asset space, more robust custody and risk-managed solutions becoming available, with talented, experienced hedge fund managers applying more traditional trading and market-neutral strategies to this rapidly maturing asset class. At the same time, we have recently witnessed Pensions becoming more proactive in their approach to education and exploration of the sector.

Table of Contents Retail vs. institutional: Diverging strategies Neo Pepe sparks retail excitement with strategic presale momentum Crypto craze unmasks Neo Pepe: An honest take to heed Neo Pepe’s path to rapid returns Ready to escape memetrix’s hold? Some leading market analysts forecast Bitcoin soaring to an impressive $600,000 by October 2025, emphasizing robust long-term institutional confidence. Veteran Wall Street analyst Fred Krueger highlights significant bullish indicators, including the U.S. government’s proposed Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and steadily increasing institutional adoption. Furthermore, Larry Fink, CEO of global investment giant BlackRock, has made even more ambitious forecasts, suggesting Bitcoin could reach valuations as high as $700,000, particularly due to potential sovereign wealth fund allocations ranging from 2–5% into cryptocurrencies. Analysts from well-respected institutions like Unchained and Binance concur, projecting valuations between $250,000 and $600,000 within the same timeframe, underlining Bitcoin’s growing role as a digital store of value and economic hedge. Yet, while Bitcoin ’s institutional future appears promising, retail investors have been actively seeking alternative cryptocurrency projects that offer immediate and substantial returns. Enter Neo Pepe, an emerging memecoin rapidly gaining traction in the crypto community. Neo Pepe has quickly captivated the attention of retail investors, swiftly raising over $1.3 million in its current Stage 4 presale, now available at an enticing token price of $0.08.

Deflationary Tokenomics: Neo Pepe features advanced deflationary mechanics, including automatic liquidity provision and strategic token burning. These mechanisms ensure sustained token scarcity, enhancing long-term value and stabilizing market conditions. Staged Presale Structure: The project offers an intricately designed 16-stage presale, each stage featuring progressively increasing token prices. This structure incentivizes early participation, rewards early backers, and generates ongoing engagement and urgency within the community. Additionally, Neo Pepe employs an hourly token unlocking schedule post-launch, designed meticulously to maintain market stability, mitigate volatility, and protect investor interests. These features surely position Neo Pepe as one of the top presales of recent memory. Crypto craze unmasks Neo Pepe: An honest take to heed Breaking away from the cookie-cutter crypto chatter, Crypto Craze delivers an insightful and refreshingly candid exploration of Neo Pepe ’s intriguing presale strategy.

2025-06-18T14:45:00,"These Altcoins Are Defying the Crypto Slump with Double-Digit Gains","Select altcoins outperform despite Bitcoin’s slowdown in mid-June 2025. Social sentiment varies widely, influencing price volatility across tokens. DeFi and real-world asset tokens show strong gains amid cautious market conditions. The crypto market has seen a general slowdown in mid-June, with many large-cap altcoins struggling as Bitcoin’s momentum falters. Since Bitcoin’s all-time high of $112,000 on May 22, the altcoin market has largely mirrored Bitcoin’s retreat, experiencing major pullbacks. However, market analytics firm Santiment has identified a select group of tokens that are bucking this bearish trend. These outliers have posted impressive returns over the past 30 days, demonstrating that specific narratives and project developments can drive growth even when the wider market is faltering. Among the best large cap 30-day returns in crypto are Newton, SPX6900, Whiterock, WhiteBIT, and Hyperliquid. We break down several notable altcoins you may have in your portfolio, and hone in on whether social signals will allow for continued rallies. https://t.co/zHPeBtNIVR pic.twitter.com/kB9hXEQjIP — Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 18, 2025 To… The post These Altcoins Are Defying the Crypto Slump with Double-Digit Gains appeared first on Coin Edition .",coinquora,https://coinedition.com/top-performing-altcoins-june-2025-santiment/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Market|Market News|News|Altcoin News",cryptocompare
