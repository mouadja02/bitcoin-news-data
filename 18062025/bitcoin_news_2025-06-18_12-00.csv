2025-06-18T09:45:58,"Gemini slams CFTC over alleged misconduct, calls seven-year probe baseless","The Winklevoss twins-owned crypto exchange Gemini has filed a formal complaint against the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), pushing back against a legal battle from 2022. In a recently submitted 13-page letter to CFTC Inspector General Christopher Skinner, Gemini accused the agency’s enforcement division of waging a years-long “lawfare” campaign driven by litigators’ personal ambition rather than public interest. The dispute stems from the 2022 lawsuit filed by the CFTC against Gemini . At the time, the agency claimed that the exchange made misleading statements back in 2017 about how its Bitcoin ( BTC ) auction prices could be manipulated, resulting in a $5 million settlement.

The exchange added that despite this, the agency pursued the case for years without producing any evidence of actual wrongdoing or market harm. “It did not matter that Gemini Trust was, in fact, the victim of fraudulent activity by multiple bad actors or that the claims against it originated with a lie-riddled whistleblower submission by a discredited former employee. The DOE Staff was willing to burn millions of dollars of taxpayer money to sue an innocent party—all because “victory” would serve their personal interests and agenda,” the letter read. Gemini further argued that the enforcement division strayed from its mission to serve the public’s interest and treat market participants fairly, and instead abused its power. The exchange now calls for internal accountability to straighten out the misconduct, pointing to the calls for reform within the system by the current head of the agency, Caroline Pham. CFTC Acting Chair calls for better regulatory era Since taking office, Pham has advocated for a higher standard of oversight in regulating the crypto industry. According to her, the CFTC “must take a forward-looking approach” to address conflicts of interest and gaps left by the previous administration. Earlier this year, Pham called for a roundtable meeting with industry figures to promote more balanced oversight and constructive dialogue. Her most recent comments came during the Coinbase Annual Summit, where she reiterated the agency’s focus on fair but firm regulations that tackle real concerns. Caroline Pham has also emphasized that the agency will not overlook misconduct, stressing that both service providers and regulators must operate within the law.

2025-06-18T09:45:09,"XRP could be gearing up for a major rally despite weak ETF reaction","XRP price continued to slide for the second straight day despite getting approval for the first spot ETF listing in Canada. According to recent reports, asset manager Purpose Investments has received final approval from Canadian regulators to launch the country’s first spot XRP ETF. Trading for the Purpose XRP ETF will begin on Wednesday, June 18, on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the ticker XRPP. Despite the approval giving Canadian investors an easy and regulated way to access XRP, it didn’t lift sentiment, and the token stayed under pressure. XRP ( XRP ) price dropped 3.4% in the past 24 hours to $2.17, with its market cap falling to $127 billion. The decline came as the broader crypto market cap dropped 3.6% over the past day, with Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other major tokens also sliding amid weak overall sentiment. This was largely driven by heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and growing uncertainty surrounding the U.S. Federal Reserve’s upcoming interest rate decision. Rising inflation risks have dimmed hopes of imminent rate cuts, prompting a risk-off mood across financial markets. You might also like: XRP, SOL ETFs face SEC delay, but approval hopes remain Despite the bearish short-term pressure, several bullish catalysts are emerging for XRP. A recent court filing in the SEC v. Ripple case revealed that both parties have agreed to a $50 million settlement . If approved, this settlement could finally resolve the long-standing legal battle that has overshadowed XRP’s regulatory clarity and hindered its broader adoption. In addition, former CFTC Chair Chris Giancarlo, appointed during the Trump administration, proposed the idea of issuing government bonds for crypto assets such as Bitcoin and XRP. He shared these insights during the XRPL Apex 2025 conference in Singapore, signaling a growing policy shift in favor of regulated crypto finance. Ripple also continues to push forward on product and regional expansion. The company is preparing for the rollout of its RLUSD stablecoin, a key addition to its ecosystem. Simultaneously, Ripple has been strengthening regulatory footholds in key crypto hubs like Dubai and Singapore, which could enhance XRP’s cross-border utility. From a technical standpoint, XRP is forming a multi-month bull pennant pattern on the 1-week/USDT chart. This bullish continuation setup typically precedes a breakout, with price targets based on the length of the initial flagpole. XRP 1-week price, 50-day and 200-day SMA chart — June 18 | Source: crypto.news In XRP’s case, a breakout could project a move to $4.61, representing a 114% gain from current levels. Supporting this thesis, technical analyst Mikybull Crypto drew parallels with XRP’s 2017 chart structure, noting that a similar bull pennant breakout preceded a rally of over 1,300% to all-time highs near $3.40. Momentum indicators, however, present a mixed picture. On the weekly chart, a golden cross has recently formed, with the 50-day SMA crossing above the 200-day SMA, typically a bullish signal suggesting trend continuation. XRP 1-day 50-day, and 200-day SMA chart — June 18 | Source: crypto.news In contrast, the daily chart has turned more bearish. The 200-day SMA has crossed above the 50-day SMA, forming a death cross, which is viewed as a bearish reversal indicator in technical analysis. In addition, both the MACD and RSI are trending lower, reinforcing short-term downside risks. XRP 1-day MACD and RSI chart — June 18 | Source: crypto.news Investor uncertainty was further amplified after the SEC delayed its decision on Franklin Templeton’s proposed spot XRP ETF, extending the review period into late July. The delay, coupled with market-wide caution, has likely contributed to XRP’s underperformance. If XRP loses the key psychological support at $2.00, further downside toward $1.62, its April 2025 low, appears likely before any sustained rebound. Conversely, holding above this level and breaking above the pennant’s resistance could reaffirm the bullish scenario and pave the way toward a retest of cycle highs.

2025-06-18T09:41:57,"Canada-based AgriFORCE launches Bitcoin mining site powered by stranded gas","AgriFORCE Growing Systems Ltd., a Canadian agricultural company, has launched a Bitcoin mining operation in Alberta, powered by stranded natural gas. In its June 17 announcement , AgriFORCE said the site was launched in partnership with energy provider BlueFlare Energy. The site, located in Berwyn, Alberta, is the company’s first operational deployment under its Power & Compute Initiative. It uses 425 kilowatts (kW) of power to support 120 Bitmain S21 ASIC miners, delivering over 32 petahashes per second (PH/s) of computing power. The deployment includes a custom-engineered mining pod with high-efficiency airflow, thermal controls, and BlueFlare’s proprietary telemetry system for performance monitoring. AgriFORCE said the Berwyn facility is powered entirely by stranded natural gas, which is natural gas that cannot be sold or accessed through traditional infrastructure. The site also features BlueFlare’s emissions tracking system, Carbon Cube, to ensure environmental compliance and real-time monitoring. Phase 2 of the project is currently underway and is expected to increase the capacity of the site by an additional 200 kW, bringing the total to over 625 kW. To date, AgriFORCE has mined seven Bitcoin across its Alberta and Ohio operations, valued at roughly $735,000. The company stated it may retain up to 50% of the mined BTC in its corporate treasury, while the remainder will be used to fund infrastructure expansion. You might also like: Tether to start open-sourcing its Bitcoin mining OS It also plans to allocate up to half of its capital raised toward direct Bitcoin purchases as part of its treasury strategy. In addition to the Berwyn site, AgriFORCE signed a binding letter of intent with BlueFlare to deploy two more sites in Alberta, located in Oyen and Hinton. Each of these will replicate the Berwyn model and include modular, off-grid gas-to-power units rated at approximately 640 kW. The new sites will support workloads beyond Bitcoin mining, including AI inference, industrial IoT processing, and edge computing. AgriFORCE aims to scale its operational capacity to over 0.5 exahashes per second (EH/s) by the fourth quarter of 2025, with a long-term target of reaching 1 EH/s by Q1 2026. As Bitcoin mining becomes more energy-intensive, operators are increasingly seeking alternative power sources to reduce costs and improve sustainability. Recent trends point to a move away from coal-based energy sources, with renewable energy adoption among miners growing at an annual rate of 5.8%. Around the world, new initiatives are emerging to support more sustainable mining practices . For instance, earlier this year, United States Senator Ted Cruz introduced the FLARE Act, a bill that offers tax incentives for crypto miners using flared natural gas to power operations. The legislation proposes 100% expensing for systems that repurpose otherwise wasted gas into electricity or computational power. Meanwhile, Pakistan recently announced plans to allocate 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity to Bitcoin mining and AI data centres as part of a broader national strategy to prevent energy wastage and attract tech investment.

2025-06-18T09:40:56,"Altcoin Season Update: Crucial Index Signals Bitcoin Dominance","BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Update: Crucial Index Signals Bitcoin Dominance Are you tracking the pulse of the Crypto Market ? If so, you’ve likely heard of the Altcoin Season Index. This crucial metric offers insights into whether altcoins are broadly outperforming Bitcoin or if Bitcoin is currently leading the charge. The latest reading suggests a significant shift is underway. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index The Altcoin Season Index, tracked by platforms like CoinMarketCap (CMC), is a valuable tool for investors trying to gauge market sentiment and potential trends. But what exactly does it measure? It focuses on the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens. The analysis looks at the performance of these top 100 altcoins relative to Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The index ranges from 1 to 100. Essentially, the index asks: How many of these major altcoins have managed to outperform Bitcoin in the last three months? Altcoin Season vs. Bitcoin Season The index clearly defines the two primary market phases: Altcoin Season: Occurs when at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The index score is typically high (often above 75). Characterized by broad rallies across many altcoins, often seeing significant percentage gains. Bitcoin Season: Occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The index score is typically low (often below 25). Characterized by Bitcoin’s dominance, where BTC might be performing strongly, consolidating, or even dipping, but altcoins are generally performing worse or stagnant. The Current Reading: Altcoin Season Index at 21 As of 00:27 UTC on June 18, the Altcoin Season Index registered a score of 21. This is a slight drop from the previous day’s figure. According to the index’s definition, a score of 21 falls squarely into the Bitcoin Season category. What does this specific number tell us? It means that in the last 90 days, less than 25% of the top 100 altcoins have managed to outperform Bitcoin. The vast majority of large-cap altcoins have either underperformed Bitcoin or seen larger losses during this period. This confirms the market’s current state: Bitcoin is the dominant force, and capital is either flowing primarily into BTC or remaining cautious regarding broader altcoin exposure. This reading is a clear signal to market participants about the prevailing trend. Why Are We Seeing Bitcoin Season Now? Several factors could contribute to the current Bitcoin Season : Post-Halving Dynamics: Historically, Bitcoin often sees a period of consolidation or slower growth after its halving event before potentially resuming an uptrend. Capital might be stabilizing or re-evaluating after the initial excitement. Institutional Inflows: The approval and activity of Bitcoin ETFs in the US have brought significant institutional capital into the market, primarily directed at Bitcoin. This sustained demand for BTC can naturally lead to its outperformance relative to altcoins. Macroeconomic Uncertainty: In times of global economic uncertainty, investors often move towards assets perceived as less risky or more established. Within the crypto space, Bitcoin is often seen as the primary ‘safe haven’ or store of value compared to the more volatile and less established altcoins. Market Consolidation: After periods of significant gains (which some altcoins saw earlier in the year), markets often enter a phase of consolidation where gains are less uniform, and capital might rotate back into the market leader (Bitcoin) before identifying the next potential movers. Understanding these potential drivers helps frame the current index reading within the broader market context. Implications for Cryptocurrency Investing During Bitcoin Season For individuals involved in Cryptocurrency Investing , a market in Bitcoin Season has practical implications: Altcoin Underperformance: Expect many altcoins, especially smaller and less established ones, to struggle to keep pace with Bitcoin, or even decline while Bitcoin holds steady or rises. Increased Volatility for Altcoins: While altcoins are generally more volatile than Bitcoin, this volatility can be amplified during Bitcoin Season, with sharp drops possible. Focus on Bitcoin: Investors primarily focused on riding the dominant trend might allocate a larger portion of their portfolio to Bitcoin. Selective Altcoin Opportunities: Not all altcoins will underperform. Specific sectors or individual projects with strong news, developments, or unique narratives might still see positive price action, but these are often exceptions rather than the rule during this phase. This is a time when careful portfolio management and realistic expectations for altcoin returns are essential. Navigating Bitcoin Season: Actionable Insights How can investors navigate the current Bitcoin Season effectively? Here are a few strategies to consider: Risk Management is Key: Review your portfolio’s altcoin exposure. Is it higher than you’re comfortable with during a period of potential underperformance? Consider setting stop-losses to limit potential downside on altcoin holdings. Avoid taking excessive leverage on altcoins during this phase. Rebalance Your Portfolio: You might consider increasing your allocation to Bitcoin or stablecoins if your goal is capital preservation or riding the BTC trend. Conversely, if you are comfortable with higher risk and believe certain altcoins are undervalued, this period might present accumulation opportunities, but exercise caution. Focus on Fundamentals: During periods of slower price action, focus on the underlying technology, adoption, development progress, and tokenomics of altcoin projects. Strong projects with real-world use cases are more likely to survive and thrive when market sentiment eventually shifts. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on the Altcoin Season Index for potential shifts. Monitor Bitcoin’s price action and overall market sentiment. Follow news related to institutional adoption, regulatory developments, and major project milestones. Approaching the market strategically during Bitcoin Season can help protect capital and position you for future opportunities. When Might Altcoin Season Return? The market is cyclical, and Bitcoin Season doesn’t last forever. What signs might indicate a potential shift back towards Altcoin Season ? Rising Altcoin Season Index: The most direct signal would be the index climbing back above the 25 threshold and heading towards 75. This would show that a growing number of altcoins are starting to outperform Bitcoin again. Broad Altcoin Rallies: Look for sustained positive price action across a wide range of altcoins, not just a few isolated pumps. Increased trading volume in altcoin pairs is also a good sign. Rotation of Capital: As Bitcoin’s rally potentially matures or consolidates at higher levels, capital might begin to rotate out of BTC and into altcoins in search of higher percentage gains. Sector-Specific Strength: Sometimes, a new Altcoin Season is kicked off by strong performance in a specific sector (e.g., DeFi, NFTs, AI tokens) that then spills over into the broader market. Predicting the exact timing is impossible, but monitoring these indicators can help identify when the tide might be turning. Conclusion: Navigating the Current Crypto Market Landscape The Altcoin Season Index currently sitting at 21 is a clear indicator that the market is firmly in Bitcoin Season . This means that, for the time being, Bitcoin is the dominant force, and most altcoins are likely to underperform it. For those engaged in Cryptocurrency Investing , this phase calls for a cautious and strategic approach. Focus on risk management, consider your portfolio allocation, and prioritize understanding the fundamentals of the projects you invest in. While Bitcoin Season presents challenges for altcoin holders, it also offers opportunities for strategic positioning. Stay informed, be patient, and prepare for when the market eventually shifts back towards favoring altcoins.

2025-06-18T09:39:21,"Chinese Bitcoin mining hardware giants are closing in on U.S. markets, what are the risks?","Three Chinese firms that control more than 90% of Bitcoin mining hardware market are reportedly setting up manufacturing hubs in the U.S. as direct result of President Trump’s tariff war. According to a recent report by Reuters, the world’s top three Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining hardware manufacturers, all originating from China, are gearing up to penetrate the U.S. market. The three companies, which are Bitmain, Canaan and MicroBT, have a stronghold on 95.4% of the machinery used in global mining rigs, according to an estimation from Consultancy Frost & Sullivan in 2023 . The biggest firm of the three by sales, Bitmain, had already established U.S. production of mining rigs back in December, right after Trump’s presidential win just a month prior. Meanwhile, Canaan started its initial U.S. production foray in April, aiming to shield itself from Trump’s Liberation Day tariffs . Senior executive Leo Wang said the initiative was a necessary exploration, considering the high tariffs could lead to heavy investments. MicroBT declared in a statement that it is currently trying to implement a localization strategy in the U.S.” to “avoid the impact of tariffs”. You might also like: U.S. vs China: How Bitcoin factors into the trade wars Are U.S. Bitcoin mining rigs in trouble? The strategic move made by each firm signifies their efforts to combat the effect of Trump’s tariffs on overseas imports. By establishing manufacturing bases in the U.S., they could effectively shy away from the tariffs in place for Chinese exports. On the other hand, their presence could potentially raise alarms in the U.S. regarding security concerns held by the federal government against Chinese technology firms, as seen in previous cases involving Chinese manufactured chips and energy-related businesses. U.S. crypto-law attorney, John Deaton, said that U.S. overreliance on Chinese hardware for Bitcoin mining “creates a choke point for U.S. miners.” He said this is because China has the upper hand, in the sense that they could restrict exports or manipulate supply and “disrupt Bitcoin’s network stability and affect U.S. users and investors.” Not only that, local players in the U.S. Bitcoin mining industry have also brought up concerns about Chinese firms coming for the market in the U.S. MARA Holdings-backed U.S. mining manufacturer Auradine is one of the rival companies that are currently lobbying to restrict Chinese supplies to stimulate competition in hardware. Auradine’s chief strategy officer, Sanjay Gupta said that Chinese mining rigs pose a “security risk,” and hundreds of thousands of them are plugged into the U.S. electrical grid. “While over 30% of global Bitcoin mining occurs in North America, more than 90% of mining hardware originates from China representing a major imbalance of geographic demand and supply,” said Gupta. According to the report, China used to dominate the entirety of the Bitcoin supply chain, from rig-making to mining to BTC trading. All of that changed after the Chinese government banned cryptocurrency in 2021 due to financial security reasons. As a result, many Chinese miners, traders and exchanges set up operations abroad. For example, Canaan moved its headquarters to Singapore, though it still has Chinese operations.

2025-06-18T09:38:06,"Is Bitcoin Done Falling? Market Metrics Say the Worst May Be Over","Bitcoin (BTC) has been consolidating over the past few days following a significant correction triggered by geopolitical tensions last week. As the consolidation continues, analysts at the crypto exchange Bitfinex have found reasons to believe that the digital asset may have hit its bottom for this correction. According to the latest Bitfinex Alpha report , market behavior, historical data, and certain metrics, such as Bitcoin Net Taker Volume, suggest that the correction may not extend further than it already has. BTC Reacts to Geopolitical Tensions Last week, BTC started with a strong rebound and recovery from earlier lows. The asset reclaimed key support levels around its previous all-time high (ATH) of $109,900, marking a 4.7% gain from the weekly open. This was supported by a temporary pause in profit-taking activity and improving market sentiment. However, things took a turn for the worse after tensions in the Middle East increased and Israel attacked Iran. BTC experienced a 7.33% peak-to-trough decline, losing much of its early-week gains amid heightened uncertainty in the markets. The cryptocurrency ended the week at 0.09% despite earlier gains. “The swift reversal highlights the marketʼs fragility in the face of exogenous shocks, and underscores how quickly sentiment can shift even during strong trend conditions. Heading into this week, all eyes are on the macro newsflow and whether BTC can maintain support above the $103-105K region,” Bitfinex stated. Is The Bottom In? While global markets continue to react to the effects of ongoing geopolitical tensions, Bitcoin is experiencing a spike in selling activity. This is evident in the Net Taker Volume, a metric that measures the balance between market buys and sells. The indicator has dropped to -$197 million, its most negative level since June 6, which suggests that traders are offloading BTC at market prices rather than waiting with passive bids. Such low readings in Net Taker Volume, especially below -$160 million, have coincided with local BTC bottoms. This is because panic selling exhausts weaker market participants, allowing larger players to accumulate the asset. One more reason for believing that BTC has hit its bottom for this decline is that the magnitude of this plunge closely aligns with the cycle median drawdown of roughly 7%, which is neither extreme nor anomalous. Analysts say this reflects a healthy consolidation phase during an ongoing uptrend rather than the onset of a deeper structural correction and that BTC is likely to recover soon.

2025-06-18T09:30:50,"Crypto Exchange Gemini Accuses CFTC Of Lawfare Campaign, ‘Toxic Culture’ In New Complaint","Gemini has accused the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) staff of waging a “trophy-hunting lawfare” campaign based on “fabricated” statements and unfairly weaponizing the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) against the crypto exchange for over seven years. Gemini Slams DOE Staff Conduct Last week, Gemini Trust sent a letter to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s Inspector General, Christopher Skinner, to raise multiple concerns and complaints about the agency’s Division of Enforcement (DOE) conduct against the crypto exchange over the past seven years. The June 13 letter accuses the DOE staff of “selectively and unfairly” weaponizing the Commodity Exchange Act to “bring dubious false statements charges against Gemini Trust” and “taking a series of legal positions that are contrary to basic principles of due process and good governance.” In 2022, the CFTC sued Gemini, claiming that the exchange issued “false and misleading statements” regarding its actions to prevent market manipulation in Bitcoin (BTC) prices in 2017. The complaint alleged that the crypto exchange gave deceiving information to the CFTC as it evaluated a possible self-certification for a BTC futures contract. In January 2025, Gemini Trust agreed to pay $5 million to the CFTC to resolve the allegations. However, it claims in Friday’s letter that it didn’t settle because it had done anything wrong, but rather “because it had no other choice” at the time. According to Gemini, the agency’s staff conduct over the past seven years shows that its “trophy-hunting lawfare” was not motivated by a desire to protect the commodities markets. Instead, it was allegedly driven by the DOE personnel’s “selfish desire to advance their careers by misusing their offices to obtain a high-profile ‘win.’” Additionally, the company argues that the DOE ignored the fact that Gemini Trust was “the victim of fraudulent activity by multiple bad actors” or that the claims originated from a “lie-riddled whistleblower submission by a discredited former employee,” former CPO Benjamin Small, who reportedly embarked on a “vindictive campaign” after he was fired. Based on this, the letter claims that the DOE Staff consistently abused their office and willingly burned millions of dollars of taxpayer money to sue an “innocent party” and “pursue fabricated and manufactured claims against Gemini Trust.” CFTC To Restore Regulatory Clarity The crypto exchange also claimed that “there is something deeply wrong with the DOE and its culture,” adding that it is well known that the division is “out of control” with a “toxic” philosophy. They consider that the public statements and remarks from CFTC acting chair Caroline Pham have shown how the DOE “has lost its way.” Recently, she criticized the previous administration’s “regulation by enforcement” approach, affirming that the agency is working to restore regulatory clarity. As reported by Bitcoinist, Pham slammed the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the CFTC’s previous reinterpretation of existing laws to persecute what they perceived as “bad” or “evil” sectors, like crypto and blockchain technology. The agency’s acting chair claimed that the CFTC will no longer “twist the law to criminalize an asset class or a technology,” focusing instead on its “core mission” to catch bad actors and prevent fraud, manipulation, and scammers in the market. However, she clarified that regulations won’t be easy on the crypto industry, or anybody, despite the agency’s new pro-innovation approach. As such, “restoring the well-settled legal precedents, how the CFTC has applied and interpreted the law for decades,” has been a priority under her leadership. Gemini Trust concluded in the letter that the CFTC’s transformation “will require serious introspection and long-term commitment from the agency as a whole to ensure that this bad-faith behavior never happens again,” and offered to “assist the Commission and Inspector General in whatever capacity they would deem helpful.”",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-exchange-gemini-accuses-cftc-of-lawfare-campaign-toxic-culture-in-new-complaint/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Caroline Pham|CFTC|CFTC acting chair|crypto exchange|Crypto exchange Gemini|gemini|Gemini Bitcoin|Gemini lawsuit|Gemini Trust|SEC",cryptocompare

Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Before we delve into the implications of the recent drop, let’s quickly recap what the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is and how it works. Provided by the software development platform Alternative, this index aims to quantify the two primary emotions that drive investor behavior in volatile markets: fear and greed. The index operates on a simple scale from 0 to 100: 0: Extreme Fear – This suggests investors are overly worried, potentially indicating a buying opportunity for those brave enough. 0-24: Fear 25-49: Neutral – This is where we currently stand. It indicates a lack of strong conviction in either direction. 50-74: Greed 75-100: Extreme Greed – This suggests the market might be due for a correction, as investors could be getting ahead of themselves. The index isn’t just a random number; it’s calculated using a blend of six key factors, each weighted differently to provide a comprehensive snapshot of crypto market sentiment: Let’s break down the components: Volatility (25%): This measures the current volatility and maximum drawdown of Bitcoin compared to its average values over the past 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility often signals increased fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This compares the current volume and market momentum to average values over the past 30 and 90 days. High buying volume in a positive market is a sign of greedy or bullish behavior. Social Media (15%): This factor analyzes posts on platforms like Twitter, looking for specific hashtags related to crypto. It checks the speed and number of posts, alongside sentiment analysis of those posts, to gauge public interest and mood. Surveys (15%): (Currently paused) This component historically incorporated weekly sentiment surveys. While paused, its potential inclusion highlights the value of direct investor opinion. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): This measures Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. Rising Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate fear, as investors might be moving funds out of smaller altcoins and into the perceived safety of Bitcoin. Conversely, falling dominance might suggest increasing confidence in altcoins (greed for higher returns). Google Trends (10%): This analyzes Google search data for crypto-related search queries. Rising search volume for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” or “crypto crash” might indicate fear, while searches for terms like “buy crypto” or specific altcoin names could signal growing interest and potential greed. The Recent Drop: From Greed to Neutral The move from 68 (Greed) to 52 (Neutral) is more than just a number change; it reflects a palpable shift in the collective mood surrounding the Bitcoin market and the wider crypto ecosystem. After a period where the market felt confident, perhaps even overly optimistic, the sentiment has cooled down significantly. What could be driving this change? Several factors might contribute to such a shift: Price Consolidation: If Bitcoin or other major cryptocurrencies have been trading sideways or experienced minor pullbacks after a run-up, this can dampen momentum and volume, impacting two key index components. Lack of Fresh Catalysts: Sometimes, markets cool off simply due to the absence of major positive news or developments that could fuel further price increases. Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Broader economic news, such as inflation data, interest rate decisions, or global geopolitical events, can easily spill over and affect risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies, leading to increased caution. Regulatory Discussions: Ongoing discussions or potential regulatory actions in various jurisdictions can introduce uncertainty, causing investors to become more hesitant. Whale Activity: Large movements of funds by major holders (‘whales’) can sometimes signal potential selling pressure or accumulation, influencing market sentiment. This shift to ‘Neutral’ doesn’t scream panic, but it certainly whispers caution. It suggests that the aggressive buying or strong bullish conviction that characterized the ‘Greed’ phase has waned. Investors are now potentially more hesitant, waiting for clearer signals before making significant moves. Why Does Crypto Market Sentiment Matter? Understanding crypto market sentiment is crucial because emotional biases heavily influence financial markets, especially one as volatile and driven by retail participation as crypto. The old adage, “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful,” highlights the contrarian approach often advocated when using sentiment indicators. When the index is in ‘Extreme Greed’, it might signal that the market is overheated and due for a correction. Conversely, ‘Extreme Fear’ often coincides with market bottoms, presenting potential accumulation zones for long-term investors. The ‘Neutral’ zone, however, is less clear-cut. It represents a state of equilibrium, or perhaps indecision. It can be a precursor to a move in either direction, depending on what catalysts emerge next. It’s a time when the market is catching its breath, potentially consolidating before the next significant trend develops. Navigating the Neutral Zone: Actionable Insights So, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is at 52, sitting comfortably in the ‘Neutral’ zone. What does this mean for you as an investor or trader? Here are some actionable insights, keeping in mind this is not financial advice: Exercise Caution: Neutrality suggests uncertainty. Avoid making impulsive decisions based purely on emotion. Stick to your pre-defined investment strategy. Focus on Market Analysis: This is a good time to dive deeper than just sentiment. Look at technical analysis (price charts, indicators), fundamental analysis (project developments, news), and macroeconomic factors. The index is a sentiment tool, not a complete trading strategy. Prepare for Volatility: The neutral zone can be a period of increased choppiness. Prices might swing back and forth as market participants wrestle for direction. Re-evaluate Positions: Use this calmer period to review your portfolio. Are you comfortable with your current allocations? Is now the time to trim some positions or look for entry points if your analysis supports it? Stay Informed: Keep up with the latest crypto news update. Major news events, regulatory clarity, or technological breakthroughs can quickly shift sentiment out of neutral. Think of the ‘Neutral’ zone as a yellow light. It’s not a red light (stop, extreme fear) or a green light (go, extreme greed, maybe proceed with caution!). It’s a signal to slow down, observe the intersection carefully, and be prepared for potential changes. Challenges and Benefits of Using the Index While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a valuable tool, it’s essential to understand its limitations. Benefits: Quick Snapshot: Provides a simple, easily digestible overview of general market sentiment. Counter-Signal Potential: Can help identify potential contrarian opportunities when sentiment is at extremes. Educational: Helps new investors understand the impact of fear and greed on markets. Challenges: Not Predictive: The index tells you the current sentiment, not where the market will go next. A high ‘Greed’ score doesn’t guarantee a crash, and a high ‘Fear’ score doesn’t guarantee a bounce. Bitcoin-Centric: While it reflects broader crypto sentiment, it is heavily weighted towards Bitcoin data (volatility, dominance, Google Trends). Altcoin-specific sentiment might differ. Factor Limitations: The chosen factors might not capture every nuance of market sentiment, and their weighting is determined by the index provider. Surveys Paused: The temporary absence of the survey component means a piece of direct investor feedback is missing. Using the index effectively means integrating it with other forms of market analysis rather than relying on it in isolation. Historical Context and Examples Looking back, we can see how the index has behaved during different market cycles. During the depths of bear markets, the index often lingers in the ‘Extreme Fear’ zone for extended periods. Conversely, during bull market peaks, it can reside in ‘Extreme Greed’. For example, during the significant price drops in past years, the index hit single digits, reflecting widespread panic. These periods, in retrospect, often represented strong accumulation opportunities for those with a long-term view and conviction. Similarly, during the euphoric phases of bull runs, scores above 80 or 90 were common, signaling a potential top or at least a point where caution was highly warranted. The current ‘Neutral’ reading is less dramatic than these extremes but equally important. It suggests a period of re-calibration after recent price action and a potential pause before the market decides its next major move. It highlights that while the extreme fear or greed has subsided, a clear directional consensus has not yet formed in the Bitcoin market and beyond. Conclusion: A Moment of Equilibrium The drop in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 52, placing it in the ‘Neutral’ zone, is a significant crypto news update for anyone following the market. It signals a shift away from the recent ‘Greed’ phase towards a state of balance or indecision. While not indicating imminent danger or opportunity like the extreme zones, ‘Neutral’ is a crucial signal for investors to remain vigilant. This period calls for careful market analysis, a focus on strategy over emotion, and preparedness for potential volatility. The index serves as a valuable reminder that market sentiment is dynamic and constantly reacting to the myriad factors influencing the Bitcoin market and the broader crypto landscape. Use this neutral period wisely to assess, plan, and stay informed.

2025-06-18T09:24:32,"Best crypto presales to buy as analysts bank on BTC’s resilience","Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market declined sharply after US President Donald Trump reignited geopolitical concerns with a pointed threat directed at Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Prices of major tokens such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) hovered near key technical levels on Wednesday following a broader sell-off the previous day. The market turned risk-averse amid growing fears that the United States may become directly involved in the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. Geopolitical flashpoints like this often trigger a flight to safety. With markets entering a defensive posture, analysts warned of further downside risk for cryptocurrencies if tensions intensify. However, one early-stage project that has shown considerable resilience during such a volatile time is Bitcoin Pepe . The project’s presale saw inflows of over $300,000 after the team made a listing announcement on June 17. Analysts bank on Bitcoin’s resilience Bitcoin remains vulnerable to further declines and must hold above $102,000 to stay positioned for a potential rebound, according to analysts at Bitfinex. In a market report published Tuesday, analysts at Bitfinex said that Bitcoin, which was trading around $104,913, must maintain support in the $102,000–$103,000 zone to indicate effective absorption of selling pressure. “Some downside risk still lingers,” the analysts noted, citing continued macroeconomic uncertainty and escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. Despite the volatility, they said the current environment represents a “high-risk, high-reward opportunity” should buyer confidence return. Crypto trader Matthew Hyland echoed the sentiment in a post on X, noting “choppy price action but still in an uptrend for BTC.” Matthew Hyland @MatthewHyland_ · Follow Choppy price action but still in an uptrend for #BTC 3:08 am · 18 Jun 2025 180 Reply Copy link Read 2 replies Expectations that Bitcoin would retest its all-time high of $111,940 were upended last week after a series of Israeli airstrikes on Iran triggered risk-off moves across global markets. Still, the Bitfinex report added that even if Bitcoin trends lower, any decline is unlikely to mirror past sharp drawdowns. Bitcoin Pepe’s presale sees strong inflows Bitcoin’s resilience amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty is helping lift sentiment across the broader crypto market, rekindling speculative appetite among investors. Historically, such environments have often preceded wider market rallies—particularly in high-volatility segments like meme coins. In this risk-on backdrop, capital is once again rotating into early-stage bets, with meme tokens emerging as early beneficiaries. Among the standout names is Bitcoin Pepe, a project that blends internet meme culture with a Layer 2 infrastructure vision. Positioned as an effort to “build Solana on Bitcoin,” Bitcoin Pepe seeks to pair the base-layer security of the Bitcoin network with the scalability and speed associated with Solana. This sets it apart from meme tokens that rely purely on community hype. The team has also released some images to showcase the real work being done. Bitcoin Pepe has gained momentum during its ongoing presale, raising close to $15 million. As per the team behind the project, the BPEP token is set to list on MEXC and BitMart, a move that is expected to enhance its visibility, liquidity, and perceived legitimacy ahead of a broader market debut. A major listing announcement is expected on June 30, adding to investor anticipation. With risk appetite recovering across crypto markets, Bitcoin Pepe appears well positioned to capitalise on speculative inflows as it enters the final stretch of its presale.

Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin continues to hold critical support around the $100,000 mark—a level that many view as the market’s last line of defense. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is down by more than 1.5% and is trading slightly above the $105k mark. On the upside, resistance sits near $109,000–$110,000, creating a narrow trading range where each bounce and pullback tests both buyers and sellers. Technical patterns point to a classic bull flag formation, hinting that once Bitcoin carves out a higher low here, it could break upward. If that happens, the next major challenge would be clearing the $109,000–$110,000 zone, after which relatively little stands in the way of a run toward $180,000–$200,000. However, the bears still have potent support levels to contend with: Fibonacci walls near $93,000 and $92,000, followed by additional floors at $85,000 and $77,000. A sustained break below these would require an extraordinary “black swan” event to shift sentiment decisively bearish. Outside of pure crypto factors, wider market moves are playing a role. A looming inverse head-and-shoulders pattern in U.S. stocks could spark a 5–10% drop there, which in turn might spill over into digital assets. For now, traders are in “protection mode,” wary of taking fresh altcoin positions until Bitcoin’s trend becomes clearer. Yet history shows these rocky phases often mark market bottoms, setting the stage for the next leg up once confidence returns. In short, Bitcoin is at a pivotal moment: hold above $100,000 and the path to new highs remains open; slip below the key support walls and deeper pullbacks become more likely.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-price-at-risk-of-falling-below-100k-heres-why/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis",cryptocompare

In a new interview on the Schwab Network, Novogratz says Bitcoin will eventually increase 850% from its current value due to increased adoption and a weakening US dollar. “The price moves on two metrics. One is adoption, more and more people being introduced to it. We call it orange pilling them. Somebody orange pilled Larry Fink, that was a big deal, because now he got all BlackRock engaged. In Invesco, our partners engaged, and more and more financial institutions are engaged. The other is the macro backdrop, which I think continues to be government spending too much money.” He also believes that younger generations will prefer investing in the top crypto asset over gold, which would send Bitcoin higher. “And so how do I think Bitcoin can go to a million? Well, gold is roughly a $20 trillion asset, and Bitcoin is roughly a $2 trillion asset. We had Warren Buffett retire. Charlie Munger passed away. They didn’t like Bitcoin. They’re not Bitcoin people, but I bet you their grandkids are right. Kids like digital stuff. And as we have this wealth transfer from baby boomers, who are all, rest their souls, going to slowly pass away and that money gets passed down, they’re going to be more willing to buy Bitcoin than gold.” Novogratz previously said Bitcoin has become an “institutionalized macro asset” just like gold or silver. Bitcoin is trading for $105,270 at time of writing, down 2.3% in the last 24 hours.

2025-06-18T09:14:58,"Washington’s Spokane City Bans Bitcoin ATMs, 11,000 Scam Complaints Received in 2024","The city of Spokane in the US state of Washington has banned crypto kiosks within city limits. The Spokane City Council has directed existing crypto ATM operators to remove dozens of machines found in convenience stores and gas stations. The Council, on Monday, voted unanimously on an ordinance that eliminates and prohibits crypto ATMs located within the Spokane city. According to a local report , the overall ban arrives as the city is seeing an uptick in scams related to Bitcoin kiosks. “This ordinance will protect vulnerable Spokane residents from scams involving virtual currency kiosks, and I am proud we are the first city in the state to move this legislation forward,” said Council Member Paul Dillon, who presented the ordinance. Per Coin ATM Radar data , there are nearly 45 Bitcoin kiosks in and around Spokane. Some of the well-known Bitcoin ATM operators in the city include Coinflip and Bitcoin Deposit. Scammers Disguised as Revenue Personnel Target Spokane Residents Police detective Tim Schwering initially raised the issue of increasing crypto ATM fraud cases. “I’ve had a number of cases where this money that’s placed in there will end up in places like China, North Korea, Russia,” Schwering told the Council . “What is happening is people are getting scammed.” Further, scammers pose as representatives from the Internal Revenue Service and ask users to buy crypto from kiosks to protect their money. In some cases, they even threaten victims, particularly senior citizens, to either follow their instructions or face jail term. Schwering applauded the Council’s decision to ban all crypto kiosks in Spokane. “This is a vital first step in protecting Spokane residents,” he said. Nearly 11K Crypto ATM Scam Complaints Received in 2024: FBI According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) estimates, there were nearly $5.6 billion in losses due to crypto ATM scams in the US. The losses amounted to over $141 million in Washington alone. The FBI 2024 report said that the agency received 10,956 complaints, amounting to $246.7 million in losses. The report added that complaints from residents increased by 99% from 2023. Source: FBI Scammers particularly target victims above 60. The FBI recorded $107 million in losses in this age category alone in over 8,000 cases. “There were cases I was confident I knew the name and bank account, but he was sitting in mainland China, and there was nothing I could do about it,” Schwering told early this month to the Spokane Council. Other cities like Stillwater, Minnesota have barred crypto ATMs in April and more cities in that state are considering similar regulations.

Accordingly, Spain's second largest bank, BBVA, recommended its clients to invest up to 7% in cryptocurrencies. Philippe Meyer, Head of Digital and Blockchain Solutions at BBVA Switzerland, said that since September 2024, they have been advising their high-net-worth clients to allocate up to 7% of their portfolio to cryptocurrencies. The bank recommends a crypto allocation between 3% and 7%, depending on the client’s risk appetite. Meyer said that BBVA currently recommends its clients to invest mainly in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), but they will expand the scope of crypto advice to other altcoins later this year. “We started advising on Bitcoin and Ethereum with private clients since September last year. We allow clients to invest up to 7% of their portfolio in crypto, depending on risk appetite. As such, we believe BBVA is one of the first major global banks to advise its clients to purchase cryptocurrencies.

2025-06-18T09:07:26,"Crypto market sinks by 2% despite GENIUS Act win","The global crypto market continues to tumble on Wednesday as escalating tensions in the Middle East prompted investors to flee riskier assets. The cumulative crypto market cap dropped by almost 2% over the last day to stand at $3.26 trillion. The 24-hour trading volume took a hit of around 9% to drop to $121 billion, suggesting that traders might take a halt now. The sell-off comes in when the US Senate made a historic move on crypto regulation. The assembly passed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act with a 68-30 bipartisan vote. However, the biggest crypto, Bitcoin, didn’t react to the positive update and dipped by 2% over the last 24 hours. Altcoins dip as tensions rise The top altcoins led the decline as Ether and Solana prices dropped by around 7-8% before slightly recovering. Ethereum price took a nose dive from trading above the $2,550 zone straight to the $2,450 zone. As the downtrend continues, Ether price is now down by 10% in the last 7 days. ETH is trading at an average price of $2,532 at press time with a trading volume of $23.2 billion. Cardano (ADA) also slid by as much as 8% during the session. The sharp reversal came after a brief rally earlier in the week. ADA has been bleeding through this year and is down by more than 27% year to date (YTD). Cardano is trading at an average price of $0.61 at press time. It is already down by 80% from its all-time high (ATH) of $3.10, registered on September 2, 2021. Bitcoin price dropped to hover around the $104k area, marking its sixth daily loss in the past seven trading sessions. BTC price still flashes green index on the frame period, but it has lost 5% of its gain over the last 7 days. The decline in crypto prices coincided with a broader market selloff driven by fears that worsening conflict in the Middle East could draw the US into deeper involvement. As per the CoinGlass data , more than $260 million in leveraged long crypto positions were liquidated over the past 24 hours. Over 105K traders were liquidated as the total liquidations hit the $320 million mark. However, the largest liquidation order of ETH/USDT was valued at $4.23 million happened on Binance. Source: CoinGlass The latest slump seems like another blow to the idea that Bitcoin serves as a hedge against geopolitical instability. US spot Bitcoin ETFs posted a total net inflow of $216 million on June 17. It marked seven consecutive days of net inflows, which is quite the opposite of the trading market situation. Even Ethereum ETFs also recorded a total net inflow of $11.09 million in the same session. Crypto’s biggest bill yet moves forward As the turbulence continues in the digital assets market, the US Senate is done with the GENIUS Act . The bill is now headed to the House of Representatives, as it represents the most significant crypto legislation to date. It is expected to bring much-needed clarity to stablecoin issuers such as Tether and Circle. The bipartisan support has given the bill strong momentum in the House, where lawmakers can either pass it as-is or make adjustments that would send it back to the Senate for final approval. Another positive move will land the bill on President Donald Trump’s desk. The stablecoin market is already $261 billion strong. Tether’s USDT is leading the tally with $155.5 billion in market cap, while Circle’s USDC is the second in the race with a cap of $61.4 billion.

2025-06-18T09:02:40,"Every Fintech Firm Will Run Its Own Blockchain `in Next Five Years:' Optimism","It’s only a matter of time until every cryptocurrency exchange and fintech firm is running its own blockchain, according to OP Labs, builder of Ethereum overlay protocol Optimism. The logic is straightforward and simple, says OP Labs head of product, Sam McIngvale, pointing to the runaway success of Coinbase’s layer-2 (L2) network Base since its debut in 2023 . For a start, Base has accrued an incredible ecosystem of users and developers to back the exchange, McIngvale said. But the biggest no-brainer is how a system like Base, combined with Coinbase’s bitcoin-backed loans , allows dormant crypto assets sitting in custody to be monetized by lending them out, he added. Base was built using Optimism's OP Stack, a software product that helps users to develop layer-2 blockchains that work with Ethereum but provide faster, cheaper transactions. McIngvale said Base's success, it's the largest layer 2 by a number of metrics including total value locked, is an illustration of how the industry is likely to develop. “I expect every crypto exchange and every fintech company to run their own blockchain in the next five years,” McIngvale said in an interview. “If you own bitcoin on Coinbase, in one button, they will take that bitcoin, move it to Base, which then lets you borrow USDC from it. And now you can go do whatever you want with that USDC.” Both Optimism and rival Arbitrum assume a transaction is valid — hence “optimistic” — with potential fraud detected through permissionless fault proofs. Optimistic rollups boost the throughput of Ethereum's base layer by processing transactions off-chain to reduce the computation load, deriving security by publishing transaction results on the underlying, or layer-1, blockchain. Another approach is to use zero-knowledge proofs to create rollups that publish cryptographic proofs of validity for off-chain transactions. McIngvale, who was instrumental in building the custody business at Coinbase, makes the further point that simply holding crypto in cold storage on a platform works out relatively expensive. “Traditionally, there’s been a cost to custody a lot of crypto, because of all the security implications,” McIngvale said. “Unlike custodying equities, where you don't really pay for that, those equities are lent out and things happen to them under the hood. Crypto is still much more nascent, but it’s moving in that direction.” There’s clearly been a bit of Base envy happening in crypto land. Global exchange Kraken has introduced Ink , a layer-2 blockchain that also uses Optimism, as have Bybit , Bitget and OKX . Fintech firms like Robinhood, for example, are also exploring their own L2s linked to Ethereum. Optimism’s modular vision of an interoperable “Superchain” would ideally allow users to go from one blockchain to another just as their browser moves from one website to another, McIngvale said. “Early adopters in crypto were way more willing to put up with kind of crappy UX,” McIngvale said. “People would wait 12 seconds for something to confirm and pay $50, because it was this new technology that they were exploring, probably akin to being online in the mid 90s. Like, it was painful.”",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/06/18/every-fintech-firm-will-run-its-own-blockchain-in-next-five-years-optimism,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|OP","Finance|Layer 2s|Base|Optimism|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-18T08:53:20,"Bitcoin Price Settles at $105K Ahead of US Fed’s Interest Rate Decision Today (Market Watch)","The volatile bitcoin price moves continued in the past 24 hours due to the quickly developing situation in the Middle East, but the asset seemed to have calmed at around $105,000. However, more fluctuations are expected today as the US Federal Reserve concludes its fourth FOMC meeting of the year, although most anticipate no changes in interest rates. BTC Back to $105K Israel’s rather surprising attack against Iran last Friday morning caused an immediate turmoil in the cryptocurrency market, as bitcoin slumped from $108,400 to under $103,000 within hours. Although both sides continued to exchange missile blows for the next several days, BTC started to recover some ground over the weekend and even went on the offensive at the start of the current business week. The culmination transpired on Monday evening and Tuesday morning when the bulls drove the primary cryptocurrency to a multi-day peak of roughly $109,000. However, the asset faced immediate rejection at that point and was pushed south hard once again. After the latest developments on the Middle East front, which include Trump’s threats against Iran, bitcoin plunged beneath $103,500 yesterday. It has bounced off since then and even tapped $105,600, but that was short-lived, and the asset is back to just under $105,000 now. As mentioned above, volatility is expected to pick up later today as the US Fed will announce its interest rate decision. For now, BTC’s market cap has dropped below $2.090 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts is close to 62%. BTCUSD.

2025-06-18T08:50:39,"EMCD: The Crypto Mining Ecosystem Powering Real-World Profitability in 2025","The post EMCD: The Crypto Mining Ecosystem Powering Real-World Profitability in 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As the crypto market continues its shift from speculation to utility, one segment of the industry remains a quiet essential: mining. While headlines focus on ETFs, memecoins, and AI integrations, miners are still the ones building the foundation of value in crypto — and they’re demanding better tools. Enter EMCD, one of the world’s top 10 Bitcoin mining pools and a rapidly expanding crypto-fintech ecosystem. Since launching in 2017, EMCD has evolved into a full-service platform for miners, offering instant asset swaps, hosted mining solutions, high-yield savings, and multi-coin support — all in one place. In an industry that often overpromises and underdelivers, EMCD is delivering consistent results, serving over 400 000 people in more than 120 countries and maintaining a real-time BTC pool hashrate of 23.67 EH/s. Built for Today’s Miners, Not Just Traders EMCD’s vision is simple: empower miners with the tools they need to maximize earnings, protect profits, and stay in control. Unlike trading-first platforms or passive wallet apps, EMCD’s ecosystem is optimized for active, income-focused users who live by the block reward. With support for 14+ mineable coins, including BTC, LTC, BCH, DOGE, DASH, KAS, and merged mining, EMCD helps users diversify their earnings across chains — and convert them instantly when needed. Complex: A Turnkey Mining Solution That’s Gaining Global Momentum One of EMCD’s standout offerings in 2025 is EMCD Complex, a remote mining service that lets users purchase ASIC hardware, hosted and maintained by EMCD. It’s fully plug-and-play: mining begins on the same day of payment, with 0% pool fees through the end of 2025. Complex is gaining popularity in Latin America, Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia, where users want direct exposure to mining income without infrastructure headaches. Ownership remains with the user, and EMCD handles everything else — from setup and optimization to energy and firmware updates. EMCD Exchange: Instant Swaps, No Third Parties With price volatility increasing, miners can’t afford delays. EMCD Exchange, the built-in swap feature, allows users to convert BTC and other rewards into USDT and stablecoins instantly — all without leaving the dashboard. This is a major benefit during market rallies or sudden drops, when locking in gains or protecting capital is time-sensitive. The service offers competitive spreads, low fees, and no transfer friction — a key edge over traditional centralized exchanges. Maximize Idle Funds With Up to 14% APY In a year where capital efficiency matters more than ever, EMCD offers a high-yield savings wallet where users can earn up to 14% APY on stablecoin balances. These earnings can be used to offset pool fees, cover Complex hosting, or reinvest automatically — turning passive balances into active revenue. The feature is popular among miners looking for low-risk, custodial alternatives to DeFi, without sacrificing yield. Transparency, Automation, and Total Control EMCD provides full visibility across operations, with: Real-time hashrate and mining stats Customizable payout settings Auto tax reports Mobile apps for iOS and Android Round-the-clock support from mining experts The platform’s infrastructure is ISO-compliant and tested under high-load conditions, ensuring security and uptime even in volatile network environments. A Trusted Name in Emerging Mining Markets EMCD has seen rapid growth in emerging regions — especially Brazil, Argentina, Ukraine, Turkey, and Vietnam — where mining offers a real hedge against inflation and fiat instability. With localized interfaces, fast onboarding, and flexible tools for small- to mid-scale operators, EMCD is increasingly seen as the platform of choice for a new wave of miners — from freelancers and tech workers to professional crypto entrepreneurs. What’s Next for EMCD in 2025? The roadmap includes: New mining algorithm support, including GPU-friendly coins Expansion of swap pairs and liquidity pools Hashrate-backed lending solutions Closer integration with DeFi and staking infrastructure EMCD is also exploring partnerships with hardware manufacturers and institutional custody providers, setting the stage for broader integrations in the Web3 economy. Conclusion In a space that moves fast and often feels fragmented, EMCD is quietly building the infrastructure that miners actually want: simple, scalable, and smart. For users who earn block by block — and think long-term — EMCD offers a real alternative to the patchwork of wallets, exchanges, and cloud services. It’s mining, money, and management all in one ecosystem.

Iranian missile fire retaliated against Israeli airstrikes that targeted military and nuclear facilities throughout Tehran on June 13. Days later, the Nobitex cyberattack seems to reflect those battlefield dynamics, pointing to a well-coordinated digital front in the ongoing war. In the past, Gonjeshke Darande has attacked Iranian institutions like fuel distribution networks and Bank Sepah, often coordinating its attacks with geopolitical events. Although Israel has never formally acknowledged ties, analysts believe the group is supported by Israeli cyber units such as Unit 8200. Nobitex, a major player in Iran’s cryptocurrency market, has come under fire in recent years for allegedly facilitating transactions with sanctioned entities. Nearly $8 billion in transactions between Nobitex and Binance occurred between 2018 and 2022, according to a report by Reuters. While the full extent of the damage is still being investigated, the timing and messaging of the attack point to a larger attempt to interrupt Iran’s digital financial infrastructure amid rising regional tensions.

2025-06-18T08:45:45,"Bitmain, Canaan, MicroBT flee tariffs with U.S. assembly","Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT — the three biggest Chinese bitcoin mining rig manufacturers — are now building their machines in the United States. They’re doing it to get around new tariffs rolled out by Trump, whose second term in the Oval has been hammering Chinese tech imports. All three companies build more than 90% of the world’s mining rigs, and they’ve decided to move production across the Pacific rather than pay the price of staying in China. Bitmain was the first to make a move. The company started assembling rigs inside the US last December, just weeks after Trump won the election. Canaan soon followed, launching test production inside the US to sidestep the 30% total import tax that Trump slapped on Chinese-made tech. Speaking to Reuters, Leo Wang, Canaan’s vice president of corporate development and capital markets, said the new US project is “exploratory” because the trade policy is still unpredictable. MicroBT, ranked third globally, said in a statement that it’s now “actively implementing a localization strategy” in the US to avoid the financial hit. Bitmain, Canaan and MicroBT chase US safety net as crypto tech faces security heat The three firms aren’t moving just for fun. They’re trying to protect their global sales and keep their American customers. According to Reuters, Guang Yang, chief technology officer at Conflux Network, said, “The US-China trade war is triggering structural, not superficial, changes in bitcoin’s supply chains.” Guang also pointed out that for American businesses, “this goes beyond tariffs. It’s a strategic pivot toward ‘politically acceptable’ hardware sources.” Right now, these three companies control the top of the global crypto food chain. They build the machines that mine bitcoin, which in turn rely on massive energy supplies, cloud infrastructure, and trading systems. Frost & Sullivan estimated that by the end of 2023, Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT were responsible for 95.4% of computing power sold worldwide. That’s a monopoly, and it’s got US firms rattled. Sanjay Gupta, chief strategy officer at US-based crypto hardware firm Auradine, said this isn’t a small issue. “While over 30% of global bitcoin mining occurs in North America, more than 90% of mining hardware originates from China representing a major imbalance of geographic demand and supply,” he told Reuters. Sanjay also warned that “hundreds of thousands of them connected to the US electrical grid is a security risk.” Leo Wang pushed back. He said the mining machines aren’t a danger. “They are useless if not applied to bitcoin mining,” he explained. But Leo admitted that the companies could still get hit with broader US crackdowns on Chinese high-tech exports. That’s already happening. Bitmain’s AI division, Sophgo , was blacklisted by the US government for national security concerns. Trump’s crypto push runs into China’s hardware dominance Back in 2021, China banned crypto entirely, claiming it was a threat to financial stability. At the time, the country controlled everything from rig production to mining and exchanges. Once Beijing made crypto illegal, most of the trading firms and mining businesses fled overseas. But Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT stayed relevant because they still made the hardware. They stayed on top by building high-performance chips that worked better than anything Western firms could come up with. They also had the advantage of being the first ones to scale. Canaan later moved its headquarters from China to Singapore, though it still has operations in China. It also opened a pilot production line inside the US, where it made 40% of its total revenue last year. “The rationale is to try to reduce the cost for both us and our customers,” Leo said. With Trump adding more pressure, he said they have “to explore all alternatives.” Trump has declared himself the “crypto president.” His son, Eric Trump, teamed up with Hut 8 to launch American Bitcoin, a miner that plans to build a national crypto reserve. But this whole “America-first” crypto dream is stuck with one problem — almost every mining rig still comes from China. John Deaton, a US attorney who works on crypto law, said the situation could get dangerous. “If China restricts exports or manipulates supply, it could disrupt bitcoin’s network stability and affect US users and investors,” he said. The biggest US-based mining companies — MARA, CleanSpark, Riot Platforms, and Core Scientific — are all relying on imported Chinese hardware to power their farms.

2025-06-18T08:42:00,"Bitcoin Price Aims for $112,500—Neo Pepe Coin Breaks 1.1 Million in Presale","Bitcoin Resurgence Sparks Market-Wide Optimism Bitcoin (BTC) is back in the spotlight as bullish momentum drives its price toward an ambitious target of $112,500, reigniting overall crypto market confidence. After a period of consolidation and indecision, this upswing isn’t just elevating BTC; it’s injecting renewed enthusiasm into altcoins and early-stage investment opportunities. Historically, BTC rallies inspire speculative capital flow into smaller, high-beta cryptocurrencies—exactly what’s happening now in 2025, drawing significant investor attention toward promising projects like Neo Pepe Coin . Market dynamics clearly illustrate how Bitcoin’s positive price action creates a ripple effect across the crypto ecosystem. As investors gain confidence in BTC’s resilience and potential for further growth, risk tolerance increases, leading capital to flow into altcoins perceived to have greater short-to-medium-term upside. Neo Pepe Protocol Takes Meme Coins to Serious Heights As Bitcoin’s rally gathers steam, investors seeking exponential returns are shifting their focus to high-potential alternatives such as Neo Pepe Protocol. Unlike traditional meme coins that thrive solely on viral hype and short-term speculation, Neo Pepe Protocol embeds robust fundamentals beneath its bold symbolism of decentralization, rebellion against financial control, and the broader establishment. Already surpassing $1.1 Million in its presale, Neo Pepe Coin is rapidly gaining recognition as a frontrunner in the meme coin space. The protocol prioritizes transparent, community-led governance through its sophisticated DAO model, bolstered by a smart-contract-managed treasury and structured tokenomics. These strong fundamentals underscore Neo Pepe Protocol’s long-term viability and differentiate it from typical meme tokens. What Makes Neo Pepe Protocol Stand Out? Here are four key features that position Neo Pepe Coin as a leading meme coin in 2025: Decentralized Governance and DAO Control: Community-driven decision-making via on-chain proposals ensures every token holder has a voice. Transparent voting mechanisms and execution delays are implemented to safeguard collective interests and prevent manipulation or rushed decision-making. Structured, Progressive Presale: A meticulously planned 16-stage presale features incrementally increasing token prices at each stage, encouraging early adoption. Early supporters are rewarded significantly, while token allocations are capped per stage to maintain exclusivity, urgency, and fairness. Auto-Liquidity and Deflationary Mechanics: Each transaction carries a permanent 2.5% liquidity fee automatically directed into Uniswap pools. Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens generated through this process are immediately burned, permanently locking liquidity and enhancing price stability and investor trust. Robust Smart Contract Infrastructure: Neo Pepe leverages a secure, non-upgradable architecture utilizing proven OpenZeppelin standards, eliminating the risk of future centralization or unauthorized changes. Immutable smart contracts ensure the protocol remains fully decentralized, transparent, and secure from centralized control or unforeseen updates. Gems Booster’s Neo Pepe Breakdown In their latest video, Gems Booster explores Neo Pepe Coin with clarity and nuance, highlighting the appealing elements of the coin’s innovative presale, including its carefully structured 16-stage pricing model designed to enhance investor interest. They emphasize Neo Pepe’s distinctive auto-liquidity system as a standout advantage, alongside praising the project’s community-centric governance, noting these as signs of a thoughtfully designed token. While Gems Booster acknowledges the uncertainties inherent in any crypto investment, their approach is optimistic overall, suggesting Neo Pepe has notable potential to resonate positively within the market. Bitcoin’s Rally Fuels Neo Pepe Coin’s Momentum With Bitcoin continuing its upward trajectory, the positive market sentiment significantly benefits structured, fundamentally sound altcoins like Neo Pepe Protocol. The protocol uniquely capitalizes on this trend through its innovative and transparent presale structure, which incorporates gamified elements such as real-time leaderboards and competitive participation incentives. These features entice both speculative traders seeking immediate returns and long-term investors drawn by solid fundamentals and community governance. The distinctive combination of cultural appeal, strategic tokenomics, accountability, and transparency positions Neo Pepe Coin not merely as another meme coin but as a credible decentralized ecosystem poised to ride the current wave of crypto market enthusiasm.

2025-06-18T08:39:36,"Next Technology Holding: A Confusing Bet On Bitcoin With AI Promises","Summary Next Technology, rebranded from WeTrade in 2024, markets itself as AI-SaaS, yet currently functions primarily as a Bitcoin holding vehicle. Interestingly, NXTT has accumulated 5,833 Bitcoin so far, while issuing shares and warrants, causing substantial shareholder dilution. Still, the company itself generates no service revenues. Their only profits stem from unrealized gains from Bitcoin holdings. Ultimately, I think NXTT is basically a play on the price of Bitcoin. However, it has many more risks without a commensurate added upside. So, I think it’s worth passing. Next Technology Holding Inc. ( NXTT ) presents itself as an AI-driven SaaS innovator with ambitions to reshape SaaS services for small businesses in China. Its financial reality tells a different story because it hasn’t generated revenues from software and relies solely on the price of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) to generate profits. During April and May 2025, the company came close to being delisted due to its stock price dropping below $1.00. And since then, they’ve doubled down on their Bitcoin holding strategy by issuing new shares and warrants, diluting shareholders, and purchasing over 5,800 BTC. Interestingly, I think their Bitcoin strategy might even be viable by itself, assuming it continues appreciating over time. However, I think its strategic vision seems rather confusing in practice, and there’s no major valuation mismatch relative to its Bitcoin holdings. So, ultimately, I deem NXTT a “Hold” at these levels. A Bitcoin Play With An AI Narrative Next Technology Holding is effectively a technology holding company that was founded back on March 28, 2019, under the name WeTrade Group Inc . However, it was later rebranded to its current name in April 2024. NXTT is currently headquartered in Shenzhen, China, with service arrangements in the US, Hong Kong, and Singapore. It’s also an extremely lean operation, as it has only around six employees. It’s also worth mentioning that their previous name was closely tied to their previous internal power struggles and conflicting control claims. Source: Next Technology Holding Website. Retrieved June 15, 2025. However, post-rebranding, NXTT has shifted from a pure-play social e-commerce SaaS company in China to a basically tech holding company with a focus on Bitcoin. The idea is similar in spirit to MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ), with a consulting business that generates revenues that are converted into treasury holdings of Bitcoin. Likewise, NXTT seems to want to produce AI-enabled SaaS products to create sales and accumulate Bitcoin. However, as of Q1 2025, they haven’t generated any revenues. Nevertheless, NXTT technically develops Software-as-a-Service [SaaS] solutions for diverse industries using artificial intelligence [AI], big data, and machine learning. Its main product is called YCloud, which is a cloud intelligence system for multichannel analytics, social recommendation, and tools for supply chain. YCloud is supposedly tailored for small online retailers in China. NXTT claims to use its social e-commerce model in China to enhance analytics and recommendations via YCloud. Source: Next Technology Holding Website. Retrieved June 15, 2025. This way, NXTT has a dual focus on software services and crypto asset holdings on paper. But it’s mostly exposed to the volatile crypto market price swings, in particular Bitcoin. Also, since they don’t really generate any revenues at the moment, NXTT has resorted to issuing equity and warrants to raise capital. Such fresh capital is then reinvested into its Bitcoin treasury, which is recorded as “digital assets” in its balance sheet. Price Surge Fueled by Bitcoin Having said that, during April and May 2025, NXTT came very close to a potential Nasdaq delisting due to a low share price. The Nasdaq issued NXTT a non-compliance notice because its closing bid price remained under $1.00 for 30 consecutive business days and granted a 180-calendar-day cure period until October 2025 to regain compliance. And as you might imagine, a delisted security loses a lot of access to capital markets, which so far have been NXTT’s main funding source. Source: Next Technology Holding Website. Retrieved June 15, 2025. Shortly after that, in early May 2025, NXTT disclosed it had purchased approximately 5,833 Bitcoins. In fact, since the end of 2024, NXTT added a whopping 5,000 Bitcoin to its balance sheet, raising its balance to 5,833. So it was actually a savvy investment since by May 2025, each Bitcoin was trading around the $90,000 level. These are basically unrealized gains that show up as “Other Income” on their financials. And so far, it doesn’t seem like they intend on realizing those gains, from what I can tell. Still, their big bet on Bitcoin prompted a substantial rally in NXTT shares, which reached a high of $3.27, around the middle of May 2025. Also, since the shares are again above the $1.00 threshold on the Nasdaq, it further eases any delisting concerns for the time being. Unfortunately, it seems NXTT stock is back again around $1.40 at the time of this writing, despite Bitcoin trading much above $100,000. This is probably because around the same time, NXTT also issued approximately 135 million new shares and 294 million warrants as payment for acquiring the aforementioned 5,000 Bitcoins. Rather than pay in cash, the company used its equity and diluted shareholders to double down on Bitcoin. Source: Seeking Alpha Charts. Moreover, NXTT also seemed again on track to develop its AI innovation and expansion objectives from early 2025. You see, in January 2025, NXTT had previously announced an upgrade to its YCloud platform by integrating DeepSeek’s models. The idea was to use this AI model for code generation, chatbots, and predictive analytics, essentially positioning this upgrade as a game-changer for efficiency and customer experience. And, as you might imagine, their paper gains on Bitcoin could help them fund these types of projects. However, according to their Q1 2025 report, NXTT hasn’t generated any service revenues yet. Valuation And Risk Analysis Now, from a valuation perspective, NXTT trades at a $527.9 million market cap, so it’s still a relatively small company for the most part. Their latest financial report shows they hold the majority of their liquid assets in “digital assets,” namely Bitcoin. You see, NXTT’s actual cash and equivalents stand at just $668.4 thousand. However, they hold an impressive 5,833 Bitcoins, which they valued at $481.7 million as of Q1 2025. In fact, at the current Bitcoin price of approximately $107 thousand, their main asset is actually worth a bit more, closer to $624.1 million. Also, in NXTT’s defense, they don’t have any financial debt other than regular operating liabilities. And their book value was $421.0 million, indicating a P/B of 1.3 as of Q1. But remember, their current Bitcoin stash has appreciated by roughly $142.4 million since Q1, implying an “updated” book value of $563.4 million. So their actual P/B is likely closer to 0.9. For comparison, their sector’s median P/B is noticeably higher at 3.3, so right from the get-go, NXTT might seem slightly cheap. Source: NXTT’s 10-Q Report. Q1 2025. Moreover, looking at the rest of their financials, NXTT is much closer to a company that just holds Bitcoin. In that sense, I think Bitcoin ETFs and the Bitcoin valuation itself are probably a better valuation metric for NXTT. So, NXTT’s Bitcoin holdings do suggest it’s roughly fairly valued. However, the reality is that NXTT’s latest Q1 showed they’re also paying G&A expenses to run this operation. In essence, I think we can consider those G&D expenses as “fees” for holding the Bitcoin for investors (at least until NXTT has actual revenues, if ever). In that sense, NXTT recorded Q1 G&A expenses of $449.9 thousand. If we annualize that figure, it indicates $1.8 million in G&A expenses. And if we compare that to my estimate of their Bitcoin “AUM” of $624.1 million, it implies an “expense ratio” of 0.29%. This expense ratio is also slightly higher than most straight-up Bitcoin ETFs , but not by a wide margin, either. As a side note, the good news is that NXTT holds so much Bitcoin that it effectively has more than enough ""cash"" runway for the foreseeable future. Source: Seeking Alpha. Plus, remember that we also take on additional risks on NXTT compared to such Bitcoin ETFs. NXTT could (in theory) raise those G&A expenses at its discretion. Similarly, they could cash in those gains and reinvest them aggressively into their AI projects, which could destroy shareholder value relative to simply holding Bitcoin. And lastly, the price of Bitcoin itself has been historically very volatile. I also find their lack of a coherent strategic vision very confusing. If you go to their website, they claim to be focused on SaaS, Blockchain, AI, Digital Assets, and even New Energy. These factors, coupled with a lack of concrete catalysts, make NXTT a very unremarkable (and potentially dubious) investment proposition in my opinion. Conclusion: Pass On This Bitcoin Play Overall, NXTT has a peculiar corporate history that has somehow evolved into a pure play on Bitcoin. While this may have been a revolutionary story before Bitcoin ETFs were approved, today it’s not as impressive. On top of that, they have interesting AI ambitions, but in practice, none of it has materialized so far. So, it’s unclear to me why anyone would take on higher risks than simply holding Bitcoin to potentially make the same gains as they would with Bitcoin alone. At the same time, I have to admit that NXTT doesn’t seem wildly overvalued or undervalued, either. Hence, I think the stock looks like a “Hold” at these levels.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4795623-next-technology-holding-a-confusing-bet-on-bitcoin-with-ai-promises?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING","BTC-USD|NXTT",cryptocompare

The purchase follows a series of convertible bond issuances totaling over 18 million euros, subscribed by UTXO Management, Moonlight Capital, Ludovic Chechin-Laurans and asset manager TOBAM. It also converted share warrants into nearly 3 million ordinary shares, raising another 1.6 million euros for bitcoin purchases. The company said it achieved a 1,173% BTC yield so far this year. The metric is defined as the ratio of total BTC held to fully diluted shares outstanding. Several companies use the term to measure how accretive their bitcoin acquisition strategy is, though they may track the yield in different ways. Even so, The Blockchain Group’s figure stands out. Strategy (MSTR), the world’s largest corporate holder of bitcoin, reported a 19.1% BTC yield year-to-date while Metaplanet (3350) reported 266.07% and Semler Scientific (SMLR) 26.7%. The Blockchain Group’s bitcoin was purchased through Swissquote Bank Europe and Banque Delubac, and is held in custody by Taurus, a Swiss digital asset infrastructure provider. The latest round of purchases brings the average cost basis of the firm’s bitcoin to about 90,000 euros per coin.

2025-06-18T08:32:09,"Which Levels Should Be Followed Next in Bitcoin? Analysis Company Announced, ""The Continuation of the Bull in Bitcoin Depends on This Level!"" He Said!","While Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a major rally last week, rising to $109,000, the tension between Israel and Iran overshadowed this. As selling pressure increases in Bitcoin, sellers are trying to take control. At this point, Bitfinex analysts said in a recent report that selling pressure from the Israel-Iran tensions has increased and Bitcoin is at risk of falling further. Despite the risk of a drop, analysts added that Bitcoin needs to hold above $102,000 for a potential recovery. At this point, analysts said that Bitcoin’s current situation resembles previous patterns that usually result in Bitcoin rallying shortly after aggressive sell-offs. “These sell-offs resemble past capitulations and often signal local bottoms. “If Bitcoin can hold the $102,000-$104,000 zone, it means that the selling pressure has been absorbed and the market is ready to recover.” Analysts also added that technical indicators suggest a short-term bottom between $102,000 and $104,000. That could potentially trigger a rally above $112,000, or new all-time highs, within six to eight weeks. Similar patterns have eventually led to rallies of 18-25% in Bitcoin, according to analysts. This Level Indicates a Bull-Bear Line in Bitcoin! Apart from Bitfinex analysts, analysis company Alphractal also pointed to $98,000 for Bitcoin. Alphractal noted that Bitcoin is likely to remain bullish as long as it remains above the key $98,300 support. However, breaking this threshold could tip BTC into a deeper correction. “As long as Bitcoin remains above the Realized Price of short-term investors (STH), we can still consider the market bullish. The bullish scenario only changes if BTC loses the $98k level, which could trigger a deeper decline.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-18T08:30:05,"Lazarus linked funds laundered through OTC brokers, says ZachXBT","Crypto investigator ZachXBT noted that illicit laundering networks and small OTC brokers have successfully laundered funds stolen in several recent hacks linked to the Lazarus Group. He estimates the Black U market on Tron is no less than $5-$10B and largely unattributed. The crypto trader also noted that many crypto exchanges sit and watch, collecting fees and doing nothing when more than 50% of the activity for their protocol comes from stolen funds. He believes that abuse in the crypto industry increased after politicians launched memecoins and numerous court cases were dropped, which further enabled the behavior. Crypto sector sees surge in illicit laundering ZachXBT believes there’s never been a worse time to do black hat (phishing, social engineering, robberies) versus gray hat hacks when the current environment is favorable. Hydra, the largest darknet marketplace in the world, previously facilitated over $5 billion in illegal transactions, primarily in BTC and Monero. Criminals used to buy and sell illicit goods, then laundered proceeds through crypto exchanges in jurisdictions with weak AML laws, privacy wallets, and OTC (over-the-counter) brokers. In 2016, hackers stole nearly 120K Bitcoin (worth $4.5 billion today) from the Bitfinex cryptocurrency exchange. The funds were moved across multiple wallets and laundered through various methods over several years, including chain hopping, crypto mixers, P2P platforms, and small VASPs. In March 2020, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned two Chinese nationals involved in laundering stolen crypto from a 2018 cyber attack against a cryptocurrency exchange. Tian Yinyin and Li Jiadong were sanctioned for laundering over $100 million in stolen funds linked to Lazarus Group. “The North Korean regime has continued its widespread campaign of extensive cyber-attacks on financial institutions to steal funds. The United States will continue to protect the global financial system by holding accountable those who help North Korea engage in cyber-crime.” – Steven Mnuchin , Former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Tom Robinson, co-founder of crypto investigator Elliptic, argued that North Korea is the best at laundering digital assets out of all criminal actors involved in cryptocurrency. Dorit Dor from the cyber security company Check Point said North Korea managed to create a successful industry for hacking and laundering through its closed system and closed economy. He also believes that a big problem is that not all crypto companies are as willing to help as others. In February, the group hacked one of ByBit’s suppliers to secretly alter the digital wallet address for a transfer of 401,000 Ethereum. Crypto exchange eXch was accused by ByBit and others of not stopping criminals from cashing out more than $90 million through the platform. Ari Redbord, global head of policy at TRM Labs, said that what sets the group’s ByBit hack apart is the pace of post-hack laundering. Redbord revealed that within two days of the attack, the group funneled $160 million through illicit channels. He also argued that the shift raised alarming questions about whether North Korea expanded its laundering capacity because criminal financial networks have never moved that quickly to process funds. DOJ files civil forfeiture complaint against North Korean government On June 5, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a civil forfeiture complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, targeting over $7.7M in digital assets, NFTs , and cryptocurrency linked to a global laundering scheme directed by North Korea. The complaint revealed that the assets represent the proceeds of wire fraud and money laundering offenses conducted by North Korean nationals acting under the direction of the Foreign Trade Bank and Ministry of Defense. The department noted that the action focused on deploying North Korean IT workers abroad — primarily in China, Russia, and UAE — who used falsified identities to gain employment at U.S. and foreign tech firms. According to the civil complaint, payments made to the individuals, often in USDC and USDT, were allegedly routed through laundering networks and ultimately transferred to wallets controlled by sanctioned Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) entities.

BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has amassed roughly 667,000 BTC, underscoring its ambition to dominate the crypto asset management market. While Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy’s vocal Bitcoin advocate, is reinforcing his bullish stance by adding more assets to the company’s balance sheet. At the same time, daring investors are also eyeing what crypto to buy now in the altcoin market, particularly Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a low-cost DeFi token poised for a breakout. Mutuum Finance, priced at just $0.03 during its presale, has already surged 200%, positioning itself as one of the most talked-about new crypto tokens this quarter. The project has gained more than 12,100 investors who have contributed $10.7 million during the ongoing presale. Investors taking part in the Mutuum Finance Phase 5 presale will see a 100% ROI when it launches at $0.06. Bitcoin consolidates near $106K as institutional support grows Bitcoin (BTC) trades at 105,943 without any drastic changes even though the volatility of general markets has increased significantly. Institutional demand is high and with the Blackrock iShares BTC Trust currently in possession of more than 667,000 BTC and the Strategy previously known as MicroStrategy, still buying its way towards being the largest corporate holder. The value of BTC could over the next few days be anywhere between the values of $106,000 and $112,000, with long-term predictions of $200,000. Bitcoin still has one of the best positions in cryptocurrencies due to constant demand and an increase in ETF flows. In the meanwhile, newer projects such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are attracting high-reward opportunities as altcoins in the market. Reimagining DeFi lending with a dual-model powerhouse Mutuum Finance is redefining decentralized lending by offering users complete control over their assets while generating passive income through flexible, secure lending mechanisms. By allowing borrowers to secure loans with multiple overcollateralized assets and enabling lenders to earn yields, the platform creates a seamless and trustless financial experience. Mutuum Finance is a strong dual-lending system that is a mixture of the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) concept. P2C mechanism uses smart contracts in controlling lending pools with dynamic interest rates that can adjust to daily changes in the market to offer predictable returns and financial stability of capital. In the P2P model, the middle man is removed and the lenders and the borrowers can transact directly. This gives it a specific and most suitable application in volatile assets such as meme coins accordingly; the user enjoys the advantage of the utilization of actual decentralization in addition to the greatest flexibility. Mutuum Finance presale enters phase 5 Mutuum Finance presale is currently in the fifth stage when an increasing number of investors have developed confidence. The project has already collected the funds of more than $10.7 million and gained more than 12100 token holders. As opposed to speculative meme coins, Mutuum Finance provides a scalable solution to the DeFi market, with its working product and real-life application, thus making a long-term solution and one with robust fundamentals and roadmap. USD-pegged stablecoin In a move to boost its DeFi platform, Mutuum Finance is introducing a fully collateralised USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum soon. Employing a system that keeps it pegged in wild markets, the stablecoin does not suffer the losses that have hounded algorithmic counterparts. Its organizational structure guarantees uniform price and stable marketability at retailers and institution levels. Adding to its credibility, Mutuum Finance has completed a full audit by CertiK, one of the blockchain industry’s most respected security firms. This certification underscores the platform’s commitment to transparency, reliability, and investor trust. Early investors benefit as community grows The project is also conducting a $100,000 giveaway where 10 people will be getting a lump sum of $10,000 MUTM tokens. It is a strong motivator not only to the whole crypto community but also those who will support the project at early stages. Bitcoin aims for $200K but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the altcoin to watch.

The group said in an X post: “After Bank Sepah, it was Nobitex's turn,” referencing their Tuesday cyberattack on Iran’s state-owned lender . They warned that Nobitex’s internal data and source code would be released within a day, and any assets left on the exchange would be “at risk.” On-chain sleuth ZachXBT flagged suspicious outflows totaling $81.7 million in Tron's TRX TRX, bitcoin BTC, dogecoin DOGE and other tokens in his Telegram channel on Wednesday. The stolen funds were traced to a wallet using a provocative vanity address: TKFuckiRGCTerroristsNoBiTEXy2r7mNX. Estimates of funds stolen was later updated to over $82 million, with funds stolen across Bitcoin, Dogecoin and EVM chains from addresses including ""0xffFFfFFffFFffFfFffFFfFfFfFFFFfFfFFFFDead,"" ""1FuckiRGCTerroristsNoBiTEXXXaAovLX,"" and ""DFuckiRGCTerroristsNoBiTEXXXWLW65t."" The group called Nobitex a “core part of the regime’s terror financing network,” accusing it of helping Iran evade international sanctions by enabling crypto-based payments. Nobitex, Iran’s largest exchange, confirmed the attack in an X post but did not mention or confirm stolen funds. At the time of writing, it is unclear what attack method was used by Gonjeshke Darande to conduct the exploit. The hack comes amid a flurry of cyber and physical attacks between Iran and Israel. Gonjeshke Darande, believed by cybersecurity analysts to have ties to Israeli intelligence , has previously claimed responsibility for coordinated infrastructure attacks on Iranian steel factories and gas stations.

2025-06-18T08:00:51,"Bitcoin NVT Enters Reversal Zone: BTC Dangerously Overvalued?","On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Network Value to Transactions (NVT) Golden Cross has surged into a zone that has historically signaled overpriced conditions for the asset. Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross Has Crossed Above 2.2 In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Darkfrost has talked about the latest trend in the NVT Golden Cross of Bitcoin. The NVT Golden Cross is an indicator based on another metric known as the NVT Ratio. The NVT Ratio keeps track of the ratio between the BTC market cap and transaction volume. The idea behind the indicator is that the ability to transact coins (as gauged by the transaction volume) could be considered as a reflection of the asset’s ‘fair value.’ Related Reading: XRP Bullish Signal: Shark & Whale Wallets Set New All-Time High Thus, through the comparison of the cryptocurrency’s current value (that is, the market cap) with this fair value, the metric can tell us about whether the asset is overvalued or undervalued. When the value of the metric is high, it means the market cap is high compared to the transaction volume. Such a trend could imply BTC may be becoming overheated. On the other hand, the indicator being low could suggest room for the coin to grow relative to its volume. Now, the NVT Golden Cross, the actual metric of relevance here, is a signaling indicator like the Bollinger bands for the NVT Ratio that aims to locate tops and bottoms in its value. The NVT Golden Cross does so by comparing the short-term trend (represented by the 10-day MA) with the long-term one (30-day MA). Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the metric over the last couple of years. As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross has recently registered a sharp uptick and entered into the region above the 2.2 mark (highlighted in red). This zone is where the cryptocurrency’s market cap has historically outpaced the transaction volume to a degree that a reversion to the mean has tended to occur. In other words, it’s where price corrections to the downside have taken place for the asset. Related Reading: Stablecoin Exchange Inflows Plummet $61 Billion—Warning Sign For Bitcoin? Though, it’s visible from the chart that not every top in the NVT Golden Cross inside this territory coincides with a price top. And in many instances that it does, the decline in the asset isn’t to some major degree. So far since the signal has appeared, however, the asset has indeed been going down, a potential sign that the same reversion effect may be in play once more. It now remains to be seen whether downside will be limited, or if this will be one of those instances where the signal was followed by an extended drawdown. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $103,700, down almost 5% in the last seven days.

2025-06-18T08:00:38,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Massive Rally Potential After Correction","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Prediction: Massive Rally Potential After Correction The cryptocurrency market is always on the move, and recently, Bitcoin (BTC) saw a dip, sliding below the $104,000 mark. This movement occurred just ahead of a key decision from the U.S. Federal Reserve regarding interest rates, highlighting how traditional financial events can sometimes influence the digital asset space. But could this correction actually be setting the stage for something bigger? Many analysts are suggesting this recent price action might be a crucial setup for a significant Bitcoin rally . Decoding the Latest BTC Price Analysis Looking closely at the charts, BTC price analysis reveals that the dip found potential support right in the zone between $102,000 and $104,000. This area is significant for a couple of reasons: Historical Resistance Turned Support: This price range previously acted as a strong resistance level. When a resistance level is broken decisively, it often turns into a support level on subsequent pullbacks. The market seems to be testing this theory now. Compressing Bollinger Bands: Technical indicators like the Bollinger Bands are showing compression. This often signals a period of low volatility that precedes a significant price move. The tighter the bands, the more explosive the potential breakout can be. These technical signals, combined with the price holding within this key zone, suggest that a short-term bottom could be forming. This is a critical observation for anyone following Crypto market analysis . What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Price Prediction? Based on these technical observations and historical market behavior, analysts are painting an optimistic picture for the near future. The prevailing Bitcoin price prediction suggests that if the $102,000-$104,000 zone holds as support, Bitcoin could be poised for a substantial upward move. Past market cycles have shown instances where similar technical setups led to rallies in the range of 18% to 25%. Applying this historical pattern to the current levels, a rally of this magnitude from the $103,000 area could potentially push Bitcoin towards the $120,000 to $129,000 range. Is a $130,000 BTC Price Target Realistic by End of Q2? According to reports, including one by Cointelegraph, analysts are specifically eyeing a potential target of around $130,000. This target aligns with the upper end of the 18-25% rally projection and is being discussed as a possibility by the end of the second quarter (Q2). This timeframe suggests a potential move over the next six to eight weeks, potentially leading to new all-time highs. However, achieving this ambitious target hinges on one crucial condition: Bitcoin must maintain its position above a key support level. The level to watch closely is $98,300. A sustained break below this price point could invalidate the bullish outlook and suggest further downside is possible. Understanding Bitcoin Technical Analysis For those new to trading or investing, Bitcoin technical analysis involves studying charts and using statistical indicators to predict future price movements. The reference to Bollinger Bands is a prime example. These bands measure market volatility and can help identify potential price squeezes (like the current one) that often lead to significant breakouts. Understanding these technical tools is vital for interpreting the market’s signals. While no indicator is foolproof, using them in conjunction with historical data provides valuable insights into potential price trajectories and key levels to monitor. Key Takeaways for Investors Here are some actionable insights derived from the current market outlook: Monitor Key Support: The $102,000-$104,000 zone is the immediate area to watch for confirmation of a short-term bottom. The more critical level for the overall bullish thesis is $98,300. Potential Upside: A successful hold of support could pave the way for an 18-25% rally, potentially targeting $130,000. Timeframe: This potential rally is anticipated to unfold over the next 6-8 weeks, aiming for the end of Q2. Volatility Ahead: The compressing Bollinger Bands suggest increased volatility is likely coming soon, which could fuel the predicted rally or lead to a breakdown if support fails. Concluding Thoughts: Is the Stage Set for a Massive Bitcoin Rally? While the recent dip below $104,000 might have caused some concern, technical indicators and historical patterns are suggesting this correction could be a necessary step before a significant move higher. Analysts are pointing towards a potential 18-25% Bitcoin rally , which could see BTC challenging or surpassing previous all-time highs and potentially reaching $130,000 by the end of Q2. As always, the market remains dynamic, and maintaining position above key support levels, particularly $98,300, is paramount for this bullish scenario to play out. Investors should stay informed and watch these levels closely. To learn more about the latest Crypto market analysis trends, explore our article on key developments shaping Bitcoin price action.

2025-06-18T07:59:43,"EIGEN displays resilience as Eigen Labs unveils EigenCloud to enrich blockchain verifiability","Crypto projects continue to build as digital assets ignore the Iran-Israel war, with Bitcoin holding above $105K. Eigen Labs confirmed releasing the EigenCloud platform, designed to bring blockchain-grade verifiability to any off or on-chain applications. The launch comes after almost a year of development and research, and it aims to solve one of the top challenges in the crypto arena – making trust programmable and verifiable at scale. The native EIGEN coin powers the new platform. EigenCloud incorporates high-end developer tools, including EigenVerify, EigenCompute, and EigenDA. These will empower developers to create functional and provably correct applications. According to Eigen Labs CEO Sreeram Kannan: EigenCloud expands the programmability of crypto and makes virtually anything verifiable on-chain. It opens up the opportunity for developers to build highly ambitious products like disintermediated digital marketplaces, on-chain insurance, fully on-chain games, automated adjudication, powerful prediction markets, and verifiable AI. Eigen Labs’ native token, EIGEN, remained elevated following the announcement. It rallied more than 2% in the past day as top altcoins like XRP, SOL, and ADA lost up to 4%. Chart by Coinamrketcap a16z bets $70M to accelerate the verifiable infrastructure Meanwhile, EigenCloud’s alphas version goes live this week and coincides with a16z crypto buying EIGEN tokens worth $70 million. The massive purchase follows the company’s $100 million investment in early 2024, raising approximately $253 million in total. The massive funding reflects unwavering confidence in Eigen Labs. Messari @MessariCrypto · Follow a16z crypto has purchased $70M in EIGEN from the Eigen Foundation.They previously led Eigen’s $100M Series B in 2024.Eigen has raised $235M in total. 6:34 PM · Jun 17, 2025 83 Reply Copy link Read 25 replies A16z’s investment reflects increased interest in Eigen Layer’s token-centered financial model as EigenCloud guarantees fresh fees that can sustain staking incentives. Meanwhile, the new investment will accelerate EigenCloud’s commercialization and support AVSs (autonomous verifiable services) on EigenLayer. The transformative EigenCloud: why is it unique? Eigen Labs’ latest release brings something that the blockchain sector has highly sought after – using crypto-economic guarantees to verify off-chain computation, logic, and agreements. EigenCloud differs from traditional cloud services and other blockchain networks as it makes verifiability a built-in feature. Developers can leverage EigenVerify to remove misbehaving nodes and resolve disputes. Also, EigneCompute supports general-purpose tasks that still use layer1-like security guarantees. These features enable developers to build high-stake applications in industries that demand trust and truth, including media, artificial intelligence, medical records, and legal agreements. Introducing programmable trust in Ethereum re-staking EigenCloud integrates general-purpose computing, dispute resolution, and data availability into a single developer-centric platform. Developers can leverage cryptography technology to prove off-chain occurrences using trust guarantees traditionally earmarked for on-chain actions. Re-staking has gained traction in kick-starting decentralized infrastructures. Eigen layer allows Ethereum investors to re-stake their ETH tokens to access third-party services (AVSs). EigenCloud wants to take the game to another level, and with assets worth over $12 billion staked on EigenLayers and more than 200 AVSs, its momentum is undeniable. Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin stated: By bringing verifiability into the cloud-native developer experiences, Sreeram and Eigen Labs have been best-in-class leaders in expanding what’s possible on Ethereum and advancing the infrastructure for more trustworthy digital systems. These developments signals increased utility and demand for EIGEN, which could mean impressive growth in the coming times.

2025-06-18T07:50:35,"Solana ETF Hope: VanEck Registers with DTCC Signaling Future Spot SOL ETF Ambitions","BitcoinWorld Solana ETF Hope: VanEck Registers with DTCC Signaling Future Spot SOL ETF Ambitions Big news is circulating in the cryptocurrency investment world. Asset management giant VanEck has taken a notable step regarding a potential Solana ETF . According to reports, VanEck has registered a proposed spot Solana ETF with the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) under the ticker symbol “VSOL.” This development, while procedural, signals growing institutional interest in offering investment products tied directly to the price of Solana (SOL). What Does DTCC Registration Mean for a Spot Solana ETF? It is crucial to understand the significance, or lack thereof, of a DTCC registration in the context of launching a new financial product like a Spot Solana ETF . The DTCC is a critical piece of market infrastructure, providing clearing and settlement services for securities transactions. Registering a ticker symbol with the DTCC is a necessary administrative step in the process of potentially listing an ETF. It involves setting up the infrastructure for clearing and settling trades should the ETF eventually launch. However, this registration is entirely separate from the regulatory approval process required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States. Registering with the DTCC does not mean the ETF is approved for trading, nor does it guarantee that the SEC will eventually approve it for listing on an exchange. Think of it as getting the plumbing ready before the building permits are approved. Why is VanEck Pursuing a SOL ETF? VanEck is a prominent player in the asset management space with a history of being at the forefront of digital asset investment products. They were among the first to file for a Bitcoin ETF and have launched other crypto-related funds. Their move to register a VanEck Solana ETF suggests a belief in Solana’s potential as an investable asset class. Several factors likely contribute to this interest: Solana’s Market Position: Solana (SOL) has emerged as one of the largest and most widely adopted cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and ecosystem activity, particularly in areas like DeFi, NFTs, and gaming. Investor Demand: There is growing investor demand for regulated and easily accessible ways to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. A SOL ETF could cater to this demand. Diversification: For investors building a diversified digital asset portfolio, Solana represents a distinct blockchain architecture and ecosystem compared to Bitcoin or Ethereum, offering diversification potential. Following the Trend: The successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has opened the door and set a precedent for other single-asset crypto ETFs. Asset managers are now exploring the next potential candidates. Comparing the VanEck Solana ETF Effort to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs The path for a VanEck Solana ETF faces similar, and perhaps unique, hurdles compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. The SEC has historically been hesitant to approve spot crypto ETFs, citing concerns about market manipulation and investor protection. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 marked a significant shift, largely attributed to the market’s maturity and surveillance sharing agreements. Ethereum’s path to a spot ETF is currently being navigated, with the SEC approving 19b-4 filings for several Ethereum ETFs in May 2024, though S-1 registration statements still require approval before trading can begin. Solana, while large, is still considered by some regulators to be potentially more centralized or less seasoned than Bitcoin or Ethereum. A key factor for SEC approval is often whether the underlying asset’s market is deemed sufficiently resistant to manipulation and if there is a regulated market of significant size for the asset. For a Spot Solana ETF , the SEC will scrutinize the spot market for SOL and its correlation with regulated futures markets (if any exist or become significant). What are the Potential Benefits of a Spot SOL ETF? If a SOL ETF were to gain SEC approval and launch, it could offer several advantages for investors: Accessibility: ETFs trade on traditional stock exchanges, making it easy for retail and institutional investors to gain exposure to Solana through standard brokerage accounts, without needing to set up crypto wallets or navigate complex exchanges. Regulation and Oversight: ETFs are regulated financial products, offering investors protections that may not be present when buying SOL directly on unregulated crypto platforms. Liquidity: ETFs typically offer high liquidity, allowing investors to buy and sell shares easily throughout the trading day. Familiarity: Many traditional investors are comfortable with the ETF structure, making it a more familiar and less intimidating way to invest in a novel asset like Solana. Challenges and the Road Ahead for a Crypto ETF Like Solana’s Despite the DTCC registration, the path to launching a Crypto ETF for Solana is fraught with challenges. The primary hurdle remains obtaining approval from the SEC. The SEC has not yet classified SOL definitively, and its regulatory stance on altcoins other than Bitcoin and Ethereum is less clear. Concerns about Solana’s network stability, past outages, and its token distribution could also be points of regulatory scrutiny. The timeline for potential SEC approval for a Spot Solana ETF is highly uncertain. It could take months or even years, depending on the SEC’s evolving stance on digital assets and specific concerns related to Solana. The process involves detailed filings, public comment periods, and extensive dialogue between the asset manager and the regulator. Actionable Insights for Investors For investors watching the development of a potential VanEck Solana ETF : Stay Informed: Follow official announcements from VanEck and the SEC regarding the filing status. Understand the Process: Recognize that DTCC registration is just one early administrative step and not an indicator of impending SEC approval. Assess Solana Itself: Any investment in a Solana ETF is fundamentally an investment in Solana. Understand the technology, ecosystem, risks, and market dynamics of SOL itself. Consider Alternatives (for now): Until a spot ETF is approved, investors can gain exposure to SOL through direct purchase on exchanges or potentially through regulated trusts or futures-based products if available, understanding the differences and risks involved with each method. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of Crypto Investment VanEck’s DTCC registration for a proposed Solana ETF is a significant administrative step that highlights the growing institutional interest in bringing regulated investment products for major cryptocurrencies to market. While it does not guarantee SEC approval, it signals that asset managers are actively preparing for a future where a Spot Solana ETF could become a reality. The journey for a SOL ETF will likely be challenging, requiring navigation of regulatory hurdles and demonstrating market maturity to the satisfaction of the SEC. Nevertheless, this move by VanEck is a positive indicator for the broader acceptance and accessibility of Solana as an asset class, potentially paving the way for more diverse Crypto ETF offerings in the future.
