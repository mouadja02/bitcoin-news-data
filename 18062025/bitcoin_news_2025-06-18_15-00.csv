2025-06-18T12:56:16,"Ethereum price outlook: $3,200 or $1,587 as 39-day range nears breakout","Ethereum has now traded in a tight range for over a month, with neither bulls nor bears taking full control. As price compresses and volatility stalls, the setup becomes increasingly primed for a strong directional move, but which way will it break? For the past 39 days, Ethereum ( ETH ) has been locked between two critical high time frame levels, with price action failing to produce a definitive trend. This prolonged consolidation signals one of two potential outcomes: an accumulation phase before continuation higher, or a distribution phase that leads to a breakdown and deeper correction. Key technical points: Range Duration: Ethereum has been range-bound for 39 days. Key Support: $2,400 (confluence of high time frame structure, moving averages, and POC). Key Resistance: $2,870 high time frame resistance. Bullish Breakout Target: Above $2,870 toward $3,200+. Bearish Breakdown Target: Loss of $2,400 opens a path to $1,587. ETHUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView At present, Ethereum is holding above the $2,400 mark, a critical support zone. This level carries significant technical confluence: it aligns with the current point of control (the highest traded volume area within this range), long-term moving averages, and past support levels. As long as Ethereum continues to close above this zone, the bullish case remains slightly favored, with the potential for a move above the $2,870 resistance. A breakout above that level would likely confirm the consolidation as accumulation, potentially triggering a rally into the low $3,000s. You might also like: BlackRock buys $1.4B Bitcoin over six-day streak amid ETF boom However, if $2,400 is lost, the bearish scenario takes precedence. A sustained breakdown below this key support would shift structure decisively in favor of the bears and open the door to a move toward the next major support around $1,587, a level last visited during prior market corrections. Importantly, price action currently sits in what can best be described as no man’s land, neither clearly bullish nor bearish. The consolidation continues, and the market awaits either a surge in volume or a catalyst to resolve this range. Traders must remain patient and let the market reveal its direction. What to expect in the coming price action Ethereum remains in a tightly coiled structure, with neither side asserting dominance. Until the $2,400 support is lost or the $2,870 resistance is broken, this range is expected to persist. Traders should wait for a confirmed breakout or breakdown before committing to directional positions.

Norway's K33 Launches 85 Million Swedish Krona Stock Offering to Buy 1,000 Bitcoins for the Treasury The company aims to raise at least SEK 85 million (approximately $8 million) with this issue and purchase up to 1,000 BTC to hold on its balance sheet. According to K33, the equity issue has already received full subscription commitments, underscoring investors’ strong confidence in the company’s Bitcoin-focused strategy. Notably, K33’s CEO signalled internal support for the scheme by committing €100,000 through his personal investment foundation. The move places K33 among the growing list of public companies looking to bolster their reserves with Bitcoin, following a similar trend by companies like MicroStrategy, Metaplanet, and The Blockchain Group. While there is no publicly disclosed timeline for the completion of the BTC purchases, K33 emphasized that the funds will be used to strengthen its long-term digital asset treasury strategy. The latest capital raise comes amid renewed institutional interest in Bitcoin, which continues to be viewed by many as a strategic inflation hedge and store of value. *This is not investment advice.

In the meantime, BTC’s price continues to feel the consequences of yet another global turmoil as it fell below $105,000 earlier today. As reported yesterday, the POTUS made some critical remarks on the Iran-Israel conflict, indicating that the US intelligence knew where Tehran’s Supreme Leader hid. Trump called Khamenei an “easy target,” but said he is safe for now. However, the US President demanded that Iran surrender unconditionally. Cited by several media outlets, Khamenei refused Trump’s proposition, saying that his country will not surrender. Moreover, Iran’s Supreme Leader warned that there will be “irreparable harm” if the US further backs Israel and joins the attacks. A White House official confirmed yesterday that Trump and Israel’s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, spoke on the phone while the US continues to build up military forces in the region. In the past few days alone, the US has sent a third Navy destroyer in the Mediterranean Sea, and a second carrier strike group is heading toward the Arabian Sea. So far, though, the Pentagon has denied that these moves are anything more than “purely defensive” operations. Bitcoin’s price slumped yesterday after Trump’s statement, and has failed to stage a meaningful recovery. It’s unlikely to do so in the near term as the tension in the Middle East continues to escalate. BTCUSD.

2025-06-18T12:30:27,"How Low Can Cardano Go? Analyst Maps Final Crash Before Resolution","After more than five weeks of unrelenting downside pressure, Cardano (ADA) finds itself approaching a potentially decisive juncture. In a new analysis published June 18, crypto analyst Quantum Ascend (@quantum_ascend) offered a fresh take on ADA’s price structure, warning that the final leg of a downward five-wave Elliott pattern may now be unfolding—with a critical resolution point drawing near. How Low Can Cardano Crash? “We dropped down into that second wave… and had it highlighted, it bounced from there. So we did call that correctly,” the analyst began, referencing earlier predictions. But despite the brief bounce, he now sees a more extended impulse playing out. “It does look like we’re turning this into more of a five-wave move down. So one, two, three, four, and working on a fifth wave now,” he explained while analyzing the one-day chart of ADA. Related Reading: Whales Dump Over 270 Million Cardano In One Week – Bearish Signal Or Shakeout? At the core of the bearish outlook is Fibonacci confluence. Quantum Ascend pointed out that ADA currently hovers around the 0.702 retracement level, with the 0.786 level lying just beneath it—both key zones often associated with deeper corrections in Elliott Wave theory. “Makes complete sense for us to go ahead and drop in right to this area at the very minimum,” he noted. Yet despite the grim technicals, the analyst maintains that no structural damage has occurred—at least not yet. “As long as we hold the 51 cent level, nothing’s broken, it’s not a problem, right?” he reassured. The broader context, however, is less encouraging: “We need Bitcoin to catch a little bit of a bid or Ethereum or something. We need some kind of good news to come in to alleviate a little bit of this because the market’s just pretty much been bleeding… for over a month now.” ADA has underperformed relative to its peers since early May, with sentiment sliding alongside price. But Quantum Ascend encouraged viewers not to overreact to the current downtrend. “All it is is an opportunity to dollar cost average,” he said, before addressing the exhaustion many long-term holders are feeling. “I know what you’re saying, QA. I’ve been dollar cost averaging for seven months. I get it. I’ve been there.” Related Reading: Nasdaq Says Yes To Cardano: ADA Earns A Spot Among Crypto Giants Rather than panic-sell or obsess over day-to-day moves, the analyst recommended mental distance and patience. “Go do something fun, it’s beautiful, it’s summer. Go do something else, anything else. But this thing is gonna resolve itself and alt season is around the corner,” he said. Despite short-term bearishness in the chart, his long-term conviction remains intact. “World War III is not starting. I could not have more conviction in all those things.” With ADA potentially entering the final leg of a corrective structure and broader markets searching for a catalyst, all eyes are now on whether support zones hold—or if Cardano is headed even lower before the long-awaited resolution finally arrives. At press time, ADA traded at $0.6158.

2025-06-18T12:30:16,"Why Is The Crypto Market Going Down Today?","The crypto market is witnessing a broad-based decline as of June 18, 2025, with major assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP registering notable losses. This downturn is being driven by a complex mix of geopolitical fears, macroeconomic uncertainty ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy decision, and a wave of leveraged liquidations. Despite recent institutional inflows into ETFs, overall sentiment remains fragile, with volatility expected to persist in the near term. Geopolitical Tensions Spark Risk-Off Sentiment One of the primary drivers behind today’s selloff is the sharp escalation in Middle East tensions. Israeli airstrikes on Iranian facilities, including the Natanz nuclear site have ignited concerns of a wider conflict involving major global powers. Iran’s retaliatory military posturing, coupled with the possibility of U.S. involvement, has sent investors fleeing risk assets.

Solana coin price could reach a potential high of $400 in 2025. With a potential surge, the SOL price could hit $1,351 by 2030. Solana is coming true to its community-claimed title, “Ethereum-Killer,” as it gradually surpasses Ethereum in the decentralized market. In a recent feat, Solana Strategies has planned to raise $1 billion to boost the ecosystem. Talking about numbers, the Solana price currently trades at a discount of 50.24% from its ATH of $ 294.33. Following this, crypto investors are storming Google with questions like “Will Solana Go Back Up?” or “How high can Solana go?” and “Will SOL price reach $500 this altcoin season?” To answer more such questions, we bring to you our Solana price prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030. We’ll address these queries using our analyses, market sentiments, and regular updates from the crypto world.

The RSI near 40.12 hints at the lack of strong momentum for a recovery. It is worth mentioning that a breakout above $170 could trigger a rally toward the $185 to $190 resistance zone. However, a failure to hold above $150 may floor the price to $140. That being said, Solana crypto is likely to trade sideways with an inclination to the bulls until the next fortnight. Potential High: $190 Average Price Range: $165 Potential Low: $140 Solana Price Prediction 2025 As per CoinGlass , Solana leads the derivatives market with $6.56B in open interest, far surpassing other altcoins. The heatmap and high trader positioning signal elevated volatility ahead. Any major price move in SOL could trigger significant market reactions, making it a key token to watch in the coming sessions. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250. Considering the present market sentiment, the SOL crypto could settle with an average trading price of around $325.

According to Arkham Intelligence data, on June 17, BlackRock purchased $250 million worth of Bitcoin ( BTC ). The acquisition is part of a broader accumulation streak that has now spanned six consecutive days, bringing the firm’s total Bitcoin investment during this period to $1.4 billion. BLACKROCK BUY STREAK: $1.4 BILLION OF BTC FOR 6 DAYS STRAIGHT BlackRock bought over $250M of BTC today, bringing their streak up to $1.4 Billion. BlackRock has now bought BTC for 6 days in a row. pic.twitter.com/VjbtlcSGk9 — Arkham (@arkham) June 17, 2025 The buying spree comes alongside a wave of inflows into BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which has consistently led all spot Bitcoin ETFs in net inflows over the past week. On the same day as its latest BTC purchase, IBIT recorded approximately $639.2 million in net inflows, even as other major issuers like Fidelity, ARK, and Bitwise posted significant outflows. The strong influx of funds and steady buying also follow a major milestone for IBIT, which recently became the fastest exchange-traded fund in history to surpass $70 billion in assets under management (AUM). The fund reached that mark in just 341 days, crushing the previous record of 1,691 days set by the SPDR Gold Shares ETF.

2025-06-18T12:20:39,"GENIUS Bill Passed Senate as Bessent Predicts $2T Stablecoin Market; Best Wallet Shines","Yesterday, in a 68–30 vote, the US Senate passed the GENIUS Act – the first significant legislation aimed at regulating stablecoins. Following this news, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated his belief that the dollar-linked stablecoin market could hit an eye-watering $2T . But with regulation comes new rules, coupled with increased government oversight. If you care about safeguarding your digital footprint, anonymous crypto wallets like Best Wallet are worth checking out as the crypto landscape shifts. These non-custodial solutions grant you complete ownership of your digital assets, eliminating the need for centralized control. Stablecoins Face Tighter Rules Under GENIUS Act So, what’s this new crypto bill all about? The GENIUS Act is short for ‘Guaranteeing Essential National Infrastructure Using Stablecoins.’ It aims to bring stability, transparency, and guardrails to the crypto industry, which traditionally operates in a gray area. If the House agrees on the final version, it heads to President Trump’s desk before August. Should everything go as planned, the bill will mark one of the most significant signs that the US is genuinely committed to crypto assets. Under the new law, only licensed institutions will be able to issue stablecoins. Large issuers with $10B+ in market capitalization will be required to transition to regulation under a comptroller or file a new application for further conditional approval with the appropriate Federal regulator. Meanwhile, smaller players must operate under pre-approved state frameworks. All payment stablecoins must be backed 1:1 by high-quality liquid assets, such as Treasury bills, notes, or bonds. Moreover, issuers will be required to publish monthly reserve disclosures, segregate customer funds from company operations, and comply with anti-money laundering rules, including customer ID checks and suspicious activity reports. Yield-bearing stablecoins are a no-go. The Treasury will standardize reserve audits, whereas the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) will get limited enforcement power in the spot market. GENIUS Act Sparks Concerns Over Privacy & Political Influence Supporters believe the bill has what it takes to increase global trust in fiat-backed digital assets and boost demand for US Treasuries. What’s more, SkyBridge Capital’s Anthony Scaramucci stated that regulated stablecoins could eliminate up to $7T in global transaction costs . On the flip side, Senator Elizabeth Warren warns that, if the bill passes, it ‘would enable Trump’s egregious corruption.’ She also fought back by saying that ‘it would mean easier access to money for terrorists and drug cartels.’The bill hasn’t been without its woes, period. It initially stalled in May after Democrats raised alarm bells over national security risks and potential loopholes. Fears significantly intensified when reports surfaced about an Abu Dhabi firm planning to invest in Binance using the stablecoin tied to Trump’s World Liberty Financial crypto venture. Foreign capital being able to flow into a major exchange through a politically-linked digital asset raised concerns about regulatory oversight and potential conflicts of interest. But after weeks of negotiations, lawmakers agreed on key revisions: tighter ethics rules for officials who hold stablecoins, stronger bankruptcy protections for bank customers, and a new Treasury mandate to monitor suspicious activity. Such changes helped secure enough Democratic support for the bill to move forward. Still, problems related to centralized control – including privacy, censorship, and single points of failure – remain key concerns for everyday crypto users. This is where emerging privacy-oriented solutions, like Best Wallet , come in. The fully decentralized, non-custodial crypto wallet puts you in control of your digital assets, free from government oversight and third-party interference. Shield Against Government Crypto Control With Best Wallet Digital freedom shouldn’t come at the cost of control or privacy. Best Wallet takes this into consideration and provides an answer to growing centralization concerns. Upon making a Best Wallet account, you have full access to your private keys and, thus, full ownership of your digital assets. Plus, you can sign up for an account and swap crypto pairs without KYC verification . The mobile app supports stablecoins like $USDT, as well as major cryptocurrencies like $BTC and $ETH, and even the best crypto presales . In total, it supports 1K+ digital assets across major networks like Ethereum, Bitcoin, BSC, Base, and Polygon. The app will soon expand its coverage to 60+ blockchains. As such, it provides you with the freedom to explore, trade, and manage an extensive crypto portfolio in one place. Thanks to its Cross-Chain Swap feature, you also get access to 30 cross-chain bridges, ensuring the best possible swap rates with minimal fees. You can also rest easy knowing the app is built with security in mind. Best Wallet uses advanced Fireblocks MPC technology to protect your assets from key vulnerabilities, breaches, and hacks. You can also create secure cloud backups of your multi-chain wallets, which eliminates the need for seed phrases . This is a major win in itself. In 2024, nearly 70% of all stolen crypto funds were the result of infrastructure breaches, mostly due to compromised private keys and seed phrases. And at the core of the app’s ecosystem is $BEST , the wallet’s native token. It unlocks lower transaction fees, staking rights (currently at a hefty 104% APY), and even governance rights on the platform. Most importantly, Best Wallet is a work in progress, and the app is constantly rolling out updates to stay competitive in the crypto market. There’s already much to look forward to in the pipeline. One of the most exciting developments is Best Card, a crypto debit card that will soon enable you to spend your digital assets in everyday life – a must-have for a crypto-forward future. $BEST Opens Possible 185% Gains Amid Stablecoin Reform The GENIUS Act signals a historic shift: crypto is on the brink of being officially accepted into US legislation. While regulation could bring trust and transparency to stablecoins, it also means deeper government control, surveillance, and barriers to entry. If you value privacy in digital ownership, non-custodial crypto wallets like Best Wallet are a great way to stay in control of your virtual assets – away from centralized intermediaries. To maximize the benefits of the Best Wallet ecosystem, you can purchase $BEST on presale for as low as $0.025195. If US crypto regulations remain favorable, the Best Wallet Token could reach $0.072 this year . Compared to its current price, this represents potential gains of up to 185%.

Key Takeaways: K33 is raising at least $9 million to buy Bitcoin and strengthen its balance sheet. The firm aims to reach a 1,000 BTC target as part of its broader treasury strategy. Direct Bitcoin holdings are expected to boost K33’s margins and attract institutional clients. The offering, managed by Pareto Securities AS, sets the share price at SEK 0.1036 and allows for an open-ended raise beyond the minimum amount, according to a Wednesday press release . The move is part of K33’s broader strategy to solidify its financial foundation and gain long-term exposure to Bitcoin, while enhancing its operational strength as a brokerage platform. K33 Advances Bitcoin Accumulation Strategy After May 28 Disclosure K33’s initiative follows a May 28 announcement detailing a dedicated BTC accumulation strategy. By holding Bitcoin directly, the firm aims to unlock operational leverage that would improve profit margins, enable new product lines, and bolster appeal to institutional partners. The company believes this approach will fuel scalable growth without exposing the acquired BTC to risk. The directed share issue offers quick access to capital, allowing K33 to respond swiftly to favorable market opportunities while bringing in strategically aligned investors. CEO Torbjørn Bull Jenssen said that the financing round marks a major step toward the company’s near-term target of acquiring 1,000 BTC. “We strongly believe that Bitcoin represents the future of global finance and are positioning K33 to benefit maximally from this,” said Jenssen. “A strong balance sheet built on Bitcoin enables us to significantly improve our brokerage operation while maintaining full exposure to Bitcoin’s upside potential.” The company has not set an upper limit for the raise, giving it flexibility to expand its BTC reserves further should demand from investors allow. The board retains the discretion to introduce a maximum offer size at a later stage.

VanEck Warns BTC Treasury Strategy May Backfire Just recently, VanEck’s head of digital asset research, Matthew Sigel, raised concerns about the Bitcoin treasury strategies used by certain public companies, suggesting that continued accumulation of BTC could soon harm shareholders more than help. He specifically criticized the use of at-the-market (ATM) share issuance programs, warning that they can become dilutive when stock prices approach the company’s Bitcoin net asset value (NAV). Sigel proposed several measures to prevent value erosion, including pausing ATM programs if a company’s stock trades below 0.95x NAV for over 10 days. He drew comparisons to past failures in the crypto mining sector, where excessive dilution and executive pay led to major shareholder losses. As an example, he cited Semler Scientific, a medical tech firm that entered the BTC space in 2024. Despite acquiring 3,808 BTC, its stock has fallen over 45%, and its mNAV has dropped to 0.82x.

Key Takeaways: ARK Invest has sold nearly $100 million worth of Circle shares in just two days. The firm’s divestment now totals over 640,000 shares, or 14% of its original stake. Despite bullish legislation, Circle’s stock dipped as ARK remained the only major backer reducing exposure. The move brings its two-day total to nearly $100 million, raising questions about the investment firm’s confidence in the USDC stablecoin issuer and the broader crypto market amid worsening geopolitical tensions. Previously, the firm sold 342,658 shares of Circle on Monday, valued at roughly $51.7 million. ARK Invest Sells 300K Circle Shares Across Three Flagship ETFs According to trade notifications , ARK sold 300,108 shares across its three major ETFs — ARK Innovation (ARKK), Next Generation Internet (ARKW), and Fintech Innovation (ARKF). ARKK accounted for the largest sale with over 208,000 shares, while ARKW and ARKF offloaded smaller portions. The timing of the sale came as Circle’s stock fell 1.3% on the day, closing at $149 after briefly trading above $165 the day prior. That drop followed the Senate’s passage of the GENIUS stablecoin bill , a legislative win that many expected to support the stablecoin industry. So far, ARK is the only major Circle investor to significantly reduce exposure post-IPO. Other backers, including BlackRock, reportedly eyeing a 10% stake in the company, have not disclosed any sales.

In an official press release , The Blockchain Group declared that it has acquired a combined total of 182 BTC ( BTC ) in the time period from May 26 to June 12. Most of the proceedings used to buy more Bitcoin came from the completion of the company’s recent convertible bond issuance, amounting to approximately $19.6 million.

After the recent purchase, the company added that there still exists one subscription left from its previous shares issuance that has not been redeemed yet. The subscription was made by TOBAM and Adam Back, and is worth around $7.31 million, which could be used to purchase another 70 BTC.

2025-06-18T12:07:43,"Bitcoin Retests 50-Day Average Support; XRP Risks Dogecoin-Like Bearish Shift in Momentum","This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. There is an old saying, ""Once is a chance, twice is a coincidence, and a third time is a trend."" It applies to bitcoin BTC right now. The cryptocurrency's price has fallen back to its 50-day simple moving average (SMA), which offered support on two occasions this month, leading to price bounces. Therefore, the latest re-test of the average presents an opportunity for the bulls to establish a trend in which the 50-day SMA powers new legs higher. Conversely, the fall of the 50-day SMA support could invite stronger selling pressure, potentially leading to a dip below $100,000. At press time, the bear case appears strong due to signs of bull fatigue, as evident from the recent shallow bounces from the 50-day SMA. The first test of the average on June 5 produced a bounce from roughly $100,500 to over $10,000. However, the second test of the SMA on June 17 saw prices bounce only from $103,000 to $109,000. The past week's Doji candle also suggests bull fatigue above $100,000. A high-volume move above $110,000 is needed to restore the immediate bullish outlook. XRP headed the DOGE way? Payments-focused cryptocurrency XRP XRP is trading at the lower end of the Ichimoku cloud, a momentum indicator based on several moving average variants and developed by a Japanese journalist in the 1960s. Crossovers above and below the cloud are said to represent bullish and bearish shifts in momentum. When an asset's price crosses below the cloud, as dogecoin DOGE did early this month, it typically signals a bearish trend. Traders often interpret this as a signal to consider selling or shorting the asset, especially if other macro or technical indicators confirm the signal. XRP's 50-day SMA has already crossed below the 200-day SMA to confirm the so-called death cross, a bearish indicator. Therefore, a potential move below the Ichimoku cloud could prove costly for the bears, potentially opening the door for a slide below $2. On the charts, support is seen directly at $ 1.60, the early April low. Coins like DOGE, ADA, and LINK have dropped below their respective Ichimoku clouds in recent days, resulting in price losses.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/18/bitcoin-retests-50-day-average-support-xrp-risks-dogecoin-like-bearish-shift-in-momentum,"BTC|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","Markets|XRP|Bitcoin|Technical Analysis|Markets|market analysis|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-18T12:05:53,"PI coin tests new lows as trading volume dips and CEX supply spike add pressure","The supply of Pi Network (PI) tokens held on centralized exchanges (CEXs) has surged more than 30% over the past three months. Trading activity for the coin has also collapsed by over 90%, on-chain data shows. The contradictory metrics has prompted some analysts to warn investors of immense sell pressures and a possible downward price action. According to updated data tracked on Piscan and exchange wallet dashboards on Wednesday, the total number of Pi coins stored across exchanges has grown from 263 million in March to 345 million in mid-June 2025. As of the latest reading, CEXs now collectively hold 346.8 million PI tokens. The rise in supply is against the backdrop of a decline in trading volume, falling from over $5.4 billion weekly in May to under $500 million this week. Exchange balances rise spells sell-side risk Detailed data from several top exchanges shows that OKX, ranked fourth on CoinMarketCap, currently holds over 28.5 million PI tokens, despite having a net outflow of 741,272 PI in the last 24 hours. Bitget, which holds the second-largest volume at 118.5 million PI, also recorded a negative 24-hour net flow of 171,036 coins. PI balance on CEX wallets. Source: Piscan Gate.io, with 163.2 million PI, is the highest among the observed CEX wallets, registering a 24-hour net outflow of over half a million coins. Overall, centralized exchange wallets processed more than 8 million PI in deposits and over 9.2 million in withdrawals in the past day alone. The withdrawals resulted in a net daily outflow of 1.13 million PI from CEXs, yet the total wallet holdings are still on the rise, even as new inflows arrive faster than existing withdrawals. The cumulative dollar value of PI stored on these exchanges now stands at approximately $187.9 million. Outflows from Pi Foundation wallets rattle community On the wallet activity scan, Pi Foundation team wallet address “GBQQRIQK…HJI25” offloaded 50 million PI in the last 24 hours, the single largest outgoing transaction recorded. This transaction was not offset by any corresponding incoming flow. Another Foundation wallet, “GAB7TEMP…4GC5G” received 50 million PI and sent out approximately 6.97 million, ending the day with a net positive flow of over 43 million tokens. These internal movements could be strategic reallocations, but the sheer scale of transactions and timing relative to falling market volume has sparked chatter of impending liquidity injections into exchanges. Altogether, the Pi Foundation and its associated wallets currently hold more than 72.5 billion PI tokens, valued at over $39.3 billion. Most remain inactive, but the selective movement of millions in PI tokens is contributing to anxiety about potential oversupply and price impact. Despite the on-chain warnings and chart-based bearish signals, the Pi Network’s dedicated community, known as Pioneers, is focused on the platform’s Global Consensus Value (GCV) of $314,159. Many community members view the market exchange price as unrepresentative of Pi’s true value, choosing instead to hold their assets or transact through the in-app barter system. Still, the current sentiment is of a community frustrated with the Core Team’s lack of visible progress. Weekly trading volume for PI has shrunk by more than 90% in a single month, dropping from $5.4 billion to less than $500 million, according to CoinMarketCap. Declines in volume often precede sharp corrections, especially in markets already flooded with tokens. $Pi is trading at $0.62 and is just getting hammer down with each $BTC dip. The strength & power to go up is gone with an always decreasing trading volume.

Statement from the Exchange!","While new hacking incidents are being added every day in the cryptocurrency sector, the latest news came from Iran. Accordingly, Iran, which is at war with Israel, experienced a major hacking incident. Blockchain security expert ZachXBT said a hacker group targeted Iranian exchange Nobitex and threatened to leak data. ZachXBT reported that Iranian cryptocurrency exchange Nobitex was hacked by the “Gonjeshke Darande” group. The group claimed responsibility, accusing Nobitex of helping the Iranian regime finance terrorism and evading sanctions. “We, as 'Gonjeshke Darande', launched a cyber attack on Nobitex. These cyber attacks are the result of Nobitex being a major tool of the regime to finance terrorism and violate sanctions,” Group X said on its account. They threatened to release the exchange's internal data within 24 hours and warned users to withdraw their funds immediately. The hacker group said the remaining assets would be at risk, with ZahXBT reporting that more than $81.7 million worth of Nobitex’s cryptocurrencies were stolen. $48.6 million of that amount was stolen ZachXBT also reported that the hacker group uses the address “TKFuckiRGCTerroristsNoBiTEXy2r7mNX.” Nobitex confirmed that they detected unauthorized access to some of their hot wallets and the wallets were immediately suspended. “Security incident notification This morning, June 19th, our technical team detected signs of unauthorized access to parts of our reporting infrastructure and hot wallet. Immediately following detection, all access was suspended and our internal security teams are closely investigating the scope of the incident. We would like to remind you that users' assets are completely safe according to cold storage standards, and the above incident only affects some of the assets in hot wallets. Nobitex accepts full responsibility for this incident and assures users that all damages will be compensated through the insurance fund and Nobitex resources. “The website and app are temporarily unavailable until a full investigation is completed. More detailed information will be released to the public once the investigation is complete.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-18T12:03:01,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: U.S. Senate Approves Stablecoin Law — Here’s Why BTC Bulls Are Celebrating","Bitcoin (BTC) hovered around 104,450 during Wednesday’s European session, slipping from recent highs as traders braced for the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy decision and tracked escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. Despite near-term selling pressure, optimism re-emerged after the U.S. Senate approved the GENIUS Act, a watershed moment for stablecoin regulation in the United States. BREAKING : US Senate just passed the Stablecoin Bill! Programmable, on-chain, 1:1 digital cash with clear rules. Massive acceleration for crypto. Next up: House ☞ Trump signs. The U.S. is about to onboard the world. Bullish is an understatement pic.twitter.com/3zpD2xwT4i — matan | eO/ACC (@matan_si) June 17, 2025 The GENIUS (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) Act passed with a 68-30 vote, making it the first federal law governing fiat-backed stablecoins. The bill enforces 1:1 reserve backing, mandatory audits, and licensing requirements for issuers. Notably, compliant stablecoins will operate outside SEC jurisdiction, a win for crypto innovation. This legal clarity is expected to encourage institutional adoption of stablecoins and create a more trusted environment for broader crypto participation. Senator Bill Hagerty praised the bill as a pivotal step toward making the U.S. the “crypto capital of the world.” Geopolitical Tensions Add Downside Risk Meanwhile, tensions in the Middle East have kept traders on the defensive. The ongoing conflict between Iran and Israel intensified following statements by former President Trump, who demanded Iran’s “unconditional surrender” in a social media post. Speculation around U.S. involvement continues to add uncertainty. GM to those who say it back! Where is Bitcoin headed in the next 12 hours? Trump has created so much uncertainty, sellers are in panic mode. Will Iran-Israel tensions send us further down?

Fed Decision Looms, Triangle Pattern Forms for Bitcoin Later today, the Federal Reserve is expected to hold rates steady at 4.25% to 4.50%, but markets are watching for dovish clues in the accompanying forecast. A signal for rate cuts later in 2025 could weaken the dollar and support Bitcoin. Technically, Bitcoin price prediction remains bearish as BTC/USD is compressing within a symmetrical triangle on the 2-hour chart, with key resistance at 106,658 and support at 103,431. The 50-EMA has flattened at 105,807, reinforcing a period of indecision. MACD momentum has turned negative, suggesting a bearish bias until a breakout confirms direction. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Trade Setup Sell Entry: Below 103,430 Target 1: 102,180 Target 2: 100,450 Stop-Loss: Above 105,800 This structure favors a short-term bearish play unless BTC decisively breaks above the upper trendline. Watch for a confirmed candle close outside the triangle with substantial volume before acting. As macro headlines and regulatory shifts collide, Bitcoin traders are watching closely—and preparing for volatility. BTC Bull Token Nears $8.2M Cap as 58% APY Staking Attracts Last-Minute Buyers With BTC trading near $105K, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The project has now raised $7,233,406 out of its $8,290,897 cap, leaving less than $1 million before the next token price hike. The current price of $0.00257 is expected to increase once the cap is hit. BTC Bull Token links its value directly to Bitcoin through two core mechanisms: BTC Airdrops reward holders, with presale participants receiving priority. Supply Burns occur automatically every time BTC increases by $50,000, reducing $BTCBULL’s circulating supply. The token also features a 58% APY staking pool holding over 1.81 billion tokens, offering: No lockups or fees Full liquidity Stable passive yields, even in volatile markets This staking model appeals to both DeFi veterans and newcomers seeking hands-off income. With just hours left and the hard cap nearly reached, momentum is building fast. BTCBULL ’s blend of Bitcoin-linked value, scarcity mechanics, and flexible staking is fueling strong demand.

2025-06-18T11:45:28,"Arthur Hayes Sounds Alarm on Emerging ‘Stablecoin Mania,’ Warns of Potential Repeat of Terra Luna’s $40,000,000,000 Collapse","BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes says Circle’s successful initial public offering (IPO) may have ignited the next major bubble in the crypto market. In a new blog post, Hayes warns that Circle’s stock market debut has marked the beginning of a “stablecoin mania” that he thinks will fleece investors who get caught up in the hype. According to the crypto veteran, Circle’s success will inspire a wave of new stablecoin issuers looking to capitalize on the hype, luring investors with promises of massive growth. “The bubble will pop after the launch of a stablecoin issuer on a public market, most likely in the US, that separates fools from tens of billions of capital by using a combination of financial engineering, leverage, and amazing showmanship… A very bankable charismatic individual will get on stage and spew all sorts of nonsense, wave his (most likely a male) hands to and fro, and convince you why the leveraged piece of dogshit he is selling is about to corner the multi-trillion dollar stablecoin total addressable market (TAM).” Hayes notes that the extent of the damage from the looming stablecoin mania will largely hinge on how the US chooses to regulate the sector. “The more freedom allowed to issuers in terms of what backs a stablecoin and whether they can pay yield to holders, the more financial engineering and leverage that can be used to mask a t*rd. If you assume a light to no touch stablecoin regulatory regime, then you could get a repeat of Terra/Luna in that an issuer creates some fugazi algorithmic stablecoin Ponzi. The issuer can pay high yield to holders and the yield comes from applying leverage to some holdings of assets.” In 2022, the Terra ecosystem collapsed after its algorithmic stablecoin LUNA lost its peg to the dollar, wiping out $40 billion in market value. For those looking to invest in other stablecoin issuers, Hayes says to keep a close watch on the project’s distribution channels. “If you stop reading here, the only question you must ask yourself when evaluating an investment in a stablecoin issuer is this: how will they distribute their product? To distribute at scale, and by that, I mean have the ability to reach millions of users affordably, an issuer must use the pipes of a crypto exchange, a Web2 social media Goliath, or a legacy bank. If they have no distribution, they have no chance of success. And if you can’t easily verify that said issuer has the access to push product through one or more of these channels, run away!” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Altcoins have had a rough few weeks, with most prices stagnating or falling even as Bitcoin continues to trades close to its all-time high as sentiment across the space slips with many investors beginning to question if holding onto altcoins is worth the wait. Market sentiment has soured significantly in recent weeks as most altcoins bleed value. This growing divergence between Bitcoin and the rest of the market has pushed key metrics to critical levels, suggesting a major market shift could be on the horizon.

2025-06-18T11:43:19,"VanEck’s Solana ETF listed with DTCC as SEC decision nears","VanEck’s proposed spot Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF), VSOL, has now appeared on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation’s (DTCC) list under the “active and pre-launch” category, marking a significant step forward in its potential approval. While this status does not guarantee regulatory clearance, it brings the fund closer to possible trading on US exchanges and reflects a broader trend of institutional recognition for Solana-based investment products. Solana ETF listing moves to pre-launch stage The DTCC listing confirms that VanEck’s VSOL is now registered for future electronic trading and clearing. This follows the SEC’s recent request that issuers, including VanEck, submit updated S-1 registration forms. Although the ETF cannot currently be created or redeemed, its presence on the DTCC’s platform signals that infrastructure is being prepared should approval be granted. Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas said the SEC is actively engaging with S-1 filings for Solana-based ETFs, suggesting growing openness to expanding crypto ETF offerings. James Seyffart @JSeyff · Follow Delay here was expected. Intermediary deadline for this was today. But, SEC is engaging on S-1 for Solana Staking ETFs and that’s a *very* positive sign. Still, timelines for approvals are less certain IMO 12:03 am · 18 Jun 2025 282 Reply Copy link Read 55 replies The SEC has already approved spot ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum, and attention is now turning to whether Solana will be next. Growing institutional interest in Solana The DTCC listing of VSOL is part of a broader wave of institutional interest in Solana. Earlier in the year, futures-based Solana ETFs — SOLZ and SOLT — were also listed on the DTCC but remain in redeemable-only status. Several asset managers, including Bitwise, CoinShares, and Franklin Templeton, have also filed for spot Solana ETFs, though the SEC has delayed decisions on some of these applications. VanEck has already launched Bitcoin and Ethereum futures ETFs and manages multiple digital asset funds globally. By adding Solana to its offering, it aims to provide investors with regulated access to one of the most actively used blockchains in the DeFi and NFT space. Solana’s ability to process thousands of transactions per second, coupled with a robust developer ecosystem and growing adoption in Web3 applications, has made it a leading candidate for mainstream financial integration. According to Polymarket, a decentralised prediction market, traders assign a 91% chance that a Solana ETF will be approved by 2025. Market reaction and Solana’s price trend Despite the development, Solana’s native token, SOL, was trading at $147.93 at the time of writing, down nearly 3% in the past 24 hours. Source: CoinMarketCap The price movement reflects caution, possibly due to broader market volatility or the uncertainty around the SEC’s timeline for a final decision. While listing with the DTCC is a critical part of bringing an ETF to market, it does not mean immediate launch. Instead, it demonstrates that the fund has met preliminary clearing and trading eligibility standards. The actual trading date for VSOL has yet to be confirmed. In the background, the SEC continues to evaluate filings for Solana ETFs. The outcome will determine whether Solana joins Bitcoin and Ethereum as the third cryptocurrency to be granted full spot ETF approval in the US.

2025-06-18T11:31:50,"Norwegian K33 launches new round of share issuance to purchase 1,000 BTC","Norwegian digital asset firm K33 wants to issue a round of shares to raise enough capital to buy as much as 1,000 BTC. The offering has already received full subscriptions. In an official press release , the Norwegian firm declared that it would issue new company shares in order to raise at least 85 million Swedish krona or equal to around $8.8 million. The digital asset firm has established the subscription price per share at 0.1036 SEK, matching the closing price on the Nasdaq First North Growth Market as of June 17. The capital raised from sales of the shares will be used to add more Bitcoin ( BTC ) to the company’s balance sheet. According to the release, the goal is to buy up to 1,000 BTC. Exposure to more Bitcoin will allow the company to diversify its holdings, improve margins and fuel scalable growth. The issuance has already attracted pre-commitments, including an investment by the CEO of K33, Torbjørn Bull Jenssen himself that amounts to about EUR 100,000. “We strongly believe that Bitcoin represents the future of global finance and are positioning K33 to benefit maximally from this,” said Jenssen in his statement. You might also like: Europe’s first Bitcoin Treasury firm plans to raise $340m to buy more BTC Aside from Jenssen, the company claimed that the shares have already gotten full subscription commitments from both existing and new investors. The minimum subscription and allocation amount in the Directed Share Issue will be a number of Offer Shares equal to EUR 100,000 per investor. However, the company may, at its sole discretion, offer and allocate amounts below the minimum. The application window opens from June 18 at 09:00 CEST and closes on June 19 at 17:30 CEST, though dates are still subject to change. However, by applying for shares, investors will automatically vote in favor of item 9 at an Extraordinary General Meeting on July 3, which would authorize the board to issue shares and financial instruments as needed. “Such undertaking applies to all shares in the Company held or controlled as of the record date for the EGM,” wrote the company in its notice. According to the release, share allocations will be decided by the board, considering factors like order size, existing holdings, and investor fit. Notification of allocation is expected around June 23, with settlement and share trading beginning in early July. Throughout the year, K33 has been accelerating its Bitcoin accumulation strategy. Earlier in May, the Norway-based firm raised 60 million SEK, worth about $5.6 million, from insiders and investors to boost its Bitcoin holdings.

2025-06-18T11:30:34,"Crypto’s Unlikely Ally: Top Analyst Reveals War As A Surprising Bullish Force","Crypto analyst Cyclop has made a potentially significant statement, claiming that the ongoing crisis between Israel and Iran may inadvertently boost the performance of digital assets. Despite recent volatility, which saw a sell-off of approximately $140 billion in the crypto market, Cyclop’s long-term analysis reveals a more optimistic outlook for the broader digital asset industry. Analyst Predicts Bullish Trends For Crypto Amid Conflicts In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Cyclop pointed to historical patterns that suggest geopolitical tensions often lead to bullish trends in cryptocurrency. Citing specific instances from April and October 2024, he noted that Bitcoin (BTC) experienced an initial decline of 18% and 10% respectively during these conflicts, only to rebound with impressive gains of 28% and 62% shortly thereafter. This trend, he argues, indicates a recurring cycle where war-related dips in crypto prices eventually transform into significant growth, as can be depicted in the chart below shared by Cyclop. Related Reading: On-Chain Analyst Warns: Bitcoin Peak Expected, Altcoins Facing -95% Plunge The analyst explains that while such conflicts can trigger short-term bearish movements, the overarching impact tends to be favorable for cryptocurrencies. As wars ignite fears of inflation and instability, Cyclop has noted that many investors for the traditional finance arena turn to crypto as a hedge against weakening fiat currencies. Unlike traditional bank accounts, cryptocurrencies are not subject to freezing, he said, making them appealing during times of geopolitical unrest. Increasingly, digital currencies are being viewed as a form of “digital gold,” a safe haven in tumultuous times. Favorable Macroeconomic Factors The current market dynamics echo previous events, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and US-Iran tensions in 2020, which similarly resulted in temporary dips followed by recoveries. Cyclop remains confident that the present situation will yield similar outcomes, despite the typical summer slowdown that often affects market activity. Supporting this bullish sentiment are favorable macroeconomic factors. Recent developments indicate that the US and China have reached a compromise, easing tariffs and aiming to stabilize global supply chains. This move is expected to help cool inflation and restore investor confidence. Moreover, President Donald Trump’s decision to delay new tariffs has contributed to a more risk-friendly environment, allowing liquidity to flow back into crypto markets. Related Reading: Dogecoin Sets The Stage For A Liftoff With Key Reversal Pattern Further aiding this positive outlook is the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which showed a modest increase of just 0.1% month-over-month, slightly below forecasts. With year-over-year inflation at 2.4%—down from an expected 2.5%—the Federal Reserve (Fed) is now anticipated to cut interest rates twice by the end of the year. Historically, such rate cuts have been bullish for cryptocurrencies, as they often lead to increased liquidity in the markets. While the immediate aftermath of the Israel-Iran conflict may present challenges, historical data suggests that cryptocurrencies have the potential to thrive in such environments.

2025-06-18T11:30:19,"James Wynn’s side wallet reportedly dumps massive MOONPIG supply","A wallet allegedly linked to James Wynn has offloaded over 10 million Moonpig tokens — a strategic de-risking or a desperate move to recover from recent liquidations? According to blockchain analyst @DataC5821 , the wallet in question dumped approximately 10.9 million Moonpig ( MOONPIG ) tokens worth $120.2K. On-chain data shows a rapid sequence of sell transactions clustered around the $14 million to $10 million market cap range, culminating in a crash to approximately $9.5 million at the time of reporting. Since then, the market cap has rebounded slightly, currently standing at $9.9 million. Looks like @JamesWynnReal is moving away from $MOONPIG as one of his side wallets dumped massive supply recently bringing down 50% token value 🩸🩸🩸 Follow @DataC58218 for more on chain updates pic.twitter.com/2rv6jDyViK — Crypto Analyst (@DataC58218) June 17, 2025 One user suggested the sell-off may have been part of Wynn’s broader portfolio strategy, noting that he had recently told his followers on X — in a post that has since been deleted — that he was de-risking in response to escalating geopolitical tensions . You might also like: The full breakdown of James Wynn’s $1B Bitcoin positions — and how it all fell apart The analyst sarcastically responded that Wynn tends to “de-risk” only after getting liquidated on Hyperliquid, implying that the MOONPING dump may have had less to do with global events and more to do with covering personal trading losses. Whether driven by geopolitical risks or not, the recent sell-off follows Wynn’s reported $100 million liquidation on Hyperliquid in late May, triggered when Bitcoin ( BTC ) price dipped below $105,000. However, it’s still unclear whether Wynn actually incurred those losses. On June 13, crypto analyst Dethective challenged this narrative, suggesting that Wynn’s losses were not actual cash outs but rather reflected trading against his own positions.

2025-06-18T11:30:00,"Public Firms Turn to Capital Markets to Accelerate Bitcoin Accumulation","Two publicly listed firms have recently taken significant steps to grow their Bitcoin treasuries, reflecting the continued adoption of cryptocurrency as a corporate reserve asset. Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ: MSTR) added approximately 10,000 BTC using proceeds from its latest preferred stock issuance, while BitMine Immersion Technologies (NYSE American: BMNR) finalized the purchase of over 150 BTC following a common stock offering. BitMine Immersion Technologies Completes $16.3M Bitcoin Treasury Acquisition Following Public Stock Offering BitMine Immersion Technologies, Inc. (NYSE American: BMNR), a publicly traded Bitcoin network infrastructure and investment company, has officially completed the deployment of all net proceeds from its recent equity raise into direct Bitcoin purchases, reinforcing its long-term strategy to build a Bitcoin-centric treasury model. In an announcement released Tuesday, the company revealed it had finalized the acquisition of 154.167 Bitcoin at an average price of $106,033 per coin, using $16.347 million—a sum that nearly mirrors the $16.340 million in net proceeds raised from its offering of common stock, which closed on June 6, 2025. A Bitcoin-First Corporate Treasury CEO Jonathan Bates commented on the milestone, saying, “We are very excited to establish our Bitcoin Treasury and fulfill our commitment to invest 100% of the transaction proceeds into Bitcoin,” said Bates. “This is not just a financial strategy—it’s a fundamental part of our identity as a Bitcoin-native business.” This direct investment marks one of the most aggressive treasury conversions to Bitcoin among US-listed public companies in 2025, aligning BitMine with the likes of Strategy and other Bitcoin-forward enterprises that have prioritized the digital asset over traditional fiat reserves. BitMine has differentiated itself from other crypto mining firms by blending traditional immersion cooling-based Bitcoin mining with emerging services in the synthetic hashrate and Bitcoin-denominated financial product sectors. The company operates mining sites in low-cost energy regions, including Trinidad, Pecos, Texas, and Silverton, where it can scale operations while minimizing energy expenditure—a critical component in maintaining profitability, especially in an increasingly competitive post-halving mining environment. Additionally, BitMine offers Bitcoin advisory services to public companies interested in navigating the complexities of earning and holding Bitcoin, either through direct mining or hashrate-related financial instruments. Market Context and Institutional Confidence The announcement comes at a time when institutional confidence in Bitcoin continues to rise, fueled by the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs, a growing list of corporate adopters , and renewed global interest in decentralized assets amid monetary policy uncertainty. Bitcoin is currently trading around $105,000, making BitMine’s average entry price relatively close to market. BitMine’s Bitcoin allocation strategy mirrors the broader corporate shift toward hard assets amid inflationary concerns and currency debasement. It also reflects the company's intent to treat Bitcoin not merely as a speculative asset, but as a strategic treasury reserve and operational foundation. As with all crypto-facing companies, BitMine has acknowledged the risks in its forward-looking statements. These include the volatility of Bitcoin, regulatory developments, and the company’s ability to adapt to a fast-evolving technology and financial landscape. Investors are reminded that future performance could vary based on a wide array of factors, including competition, energy pricing, the global economic climate, and the evolving valuation of Bitcoin itself. The company filed its latest Form 10-K with the SEC on April 3, 2025, and notes that all forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and disclosures outlined in those filings. Strategy Inc. Nears 600,000 Bitcoin as It Converts $1B in Preferred Stock Sales into Massive BTC Purchase In related news, corporate Bitcoin treasury firm Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ: MSTR) has acquired approximately 10,000 additional bitcoins for $1 billion, bringing its total holdings to a staggering 592,100 BTC—just shy of the 600,000 BTC milestone. This monumental purchase cements Strategy’s dominance as the largest publicly traded holder of Bitcoin and underscores its long-term conviction in the digital asset as a superior treasury reserve. The company’s relentless Bitcoin accumulation has drawn widespread attention from both institutional investors and regulatory observers alike. Top 10 largest corporate Bitcoin holders (Source: BitcoinTreasuries ) The latest acquisition was primarily funded by the $1 billion upsized IPO of the firm’s newly launched Stride (STRD) perpetual preferred stock, which offers a 10% non-cumulative fixed dividend and is non-convertible. The offering drew strong institutional interest and marks another key pillar in the company’s innovative financing ecosystem. Additional funding for the purchase was sourced from the at-the-market (ATM) sales of two other perpetual preferred stock programs: Strike (STRK) and Strife (STRF). STRK offers an 8% fixed dividend and is convertible, while STRF provides a 10% cumulative dividend and is non-convertible. According to TD Cowen analysts, this structured approach “establishes a channel for future high-yield funds flows into Bitcoin,” providing Strategy with scalable, long-term funding sources that minimize dilution to common shareholders while maximizing Bitcoin exposure. The Bigger Vision: “42/42” and Long-Term Leverage The latest round of buying is part of Strategy’s aggressive and ambitious “42/42” plan, which seeks to raise $84 billion in equity and convertible debt offerings by 2027, all earmarked for Bitcoin acquisitions. The firm, led by Bitcoin evangelist and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, has become synonymous with the institutionalization of Bitcoin. On a recent earnings call, Saylor outlined the firm’s target leverage ratio of 20%–30%, calculated as total debt and preferred stock divided by the market value of Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings. As of now, the firm sits on $63 billion in Bitcoin and $11.6 billion in total liabilities (including preferred shares), which analysts say supports a strong balance sheet. Analysts at TD Cowen remain bullish, reaffirming their “Buy” rating on Strategy stock and setting a $590 price target for MSTR shares. In a note published Tuesday, the bank emphasized the relative safety of Strategy’s junior securities given the firm’s asset base and modest debt load. The perpetual nature of the preferred stock means the capital raised can remain on the balance sheet indefinitely, offering the firm consistent liquidity without the looming burden of debt maturity—making it a highly flexible instrument for Bitcoin acquisition. Strategy’s Role in Institutionalizing Bitcoin Strategy Inc.'s actions are seen as a watershed moment for Bitcoin’s integration into traditional corporate finance. By issuing fixed-income-style securities tied to a Bitcoin accumulation strategy, the firm is effectively creating a new model for capital markets to interface with crypto assets. This model allows yield-hungry investors to access Bitcoin exposure through income-generating instruments, while enabling Strategy to accumulate BTC without shareholder dilution. It also sends a strong message to Wall Street: Bitcoin is not just a hedge or an asset—it's a treasury standard. With this latest purchase, Strategy now holds more Bitcoin than most countries and is rapidly approaching the symbolic 600,000 BTC mark. As the price of Bitcoin continues to climb, the company’s holdings represent a significant portion of the total circulating supply, amplifying its influence in the crypto and financial sectors.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9608/public-firms-turn-to-capital-markets-to-accelerate-bitcoin-accumulation,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-06-18T11:30:00,"Why the Next ETH Pump Could Send Crypto Barn Soaring!","The prophecy is coming true! The Simpsons told us it would! In 1997, Crypto Barn gave us a glimpse into the possibilities of Crypto, and now we’re riding the narrative and reaping the rewards. But that’s not all! Ethereum is on the precipice of something huge, and potentially taking Crypto Barn to new heights! $BARN has the Crypto degens talking, with Apex Syndicate claiming it will be the next $DOGE, and Crypto Goals forecasting it to 1000x in the coming months. Here’s how $BARN is getting ready to take off with ETH! Ethereum jumped 38% in early May $BARN is poised to pump with ETH $BARN grew 7,114.5% in 8 days The ETH chain advantage for meme coins Forecasts show Ethereum, a long-term rival of Bitcoin, could dominate Bitcoin with its recent performance trends, which could bode well for Memecoins. Early May, ETH added a remarkable 38% value—clearly, some sharks were circling. Considering it’s a $280 billion asset, this was impressive! But this bullish wave didn’t just benefit ETH holders, but also signals to Memecoin holders that a potential pump is on the horizon. The advantage of Memecoins is that they have a smaller market cap, which gives them more room to run in a bullish market. While stablecoins like ETH need vast amounts of money to increase by 10%, smaller caps don’t, thus improving the potential profits for coin holders. So, as ETH sees a pump, popular ETH-based Memecoins are poised to follow! Enter $BARN: Why it’s poised to pump If ETH continues on its upward trajectory, which is expected, $BARN is in a prime position to grow with it. If you don’t believe us, it’s written in history! In 1997, the Simpsons quietly hinted at a future driven by crypto with Crypto Barn, a small store for codes in the background of a scene. Cryptocurrency wasn’t even a word then! $BARN has a real narrative and strong community backing it, ticking the boxes needed for success in the volatile crypto market. With the rise of ETH, this low-cap runner is poised to follow. $BARN forecast – how far can this go? $BARN has huge potential because it is small, or as Apex Syndicate says, “a micro-cap memecoin with great community backing”! It has a current market cap of under $350k, after a pullback from all-time highs following market uncertainty. To give you an idea of how $BARN has grown, by the end of May, it settled around $40k market cap, growing tremendously by the 4th of June to over $1 million! That’s a 7,114.5% increase in just 8 days. Influencers like Apex and Crypto Goals believe it will exceed this, even rivalling $DOGE! You don’t want to miss out on $BARN’s next run! It’s going to be wild!

2025-06-18T11:28:51,"Best Crypto to Buy Now: ETH vs BTC—Whales Already Picked a Side","The post Best Crypto to Buy Now: ETH vs BTC—Whales Already Picked a Side appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Institutional profit booking from Bitcoin has disrupted the money flow, prompting whales to rotate capital into altcoins. This trend signals a strategic shift in smart money away from Bitcoin and toward higher-growth projects. Historical trends point to a breakout altseason as funds rotate out of Bitcoin into more agile projects. Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) is combining Bitcoin’s unmatched security with the speed and scalability of Solana through its PEP-20 token standard, enabling meme coin infrastructure directly on Bitcoin. With over $14.6m already raised from whales, BPEP is gaining rapid momentum. After nearly four months of correction, bullish momentum has reignited in the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin shattering all historical benchmarks. BTC is trading firmly above $105,000, a significant support level after setting a fresh all-time high of $112,000 in May. What sets this cycle apart is the strategic redirection of institutional capital into altcoins. Ethereum ETFs have had their 18th consecutive net inflow day , a streak that began mid-May. However, the volatility in Bitcoin ETFs has disturbed the inflow. Also, while Bitcoin has surged 48% from its April low, Ethereum has posted a higher ROI in the same time period. This shows that the professional money is already starting to rotate to altcoins. Image Courtesy: TradingView Historical trends also suggest that the altcoin season is close. Currently, Bitcoin dominance is hovering around 64% . This mirrors what happened in 2017, when Bitcoin’s dominance hit around 60%, and altcoins exploded shortly after. As this capital rotation accelerates, astute investors are increasing their exposure in projects positioned to reap the benefits. Projects like Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) are poised to use this mass altcoin rotation. Bitcoin Pepe has already raised $14.6m to build Bitcoin’s first meme playground, and they’re coming with an announcement on June 30 for their blockbuster multi-exchange listing. In altcoin bull rallies, projects with strong utility and innovative infrastructure tend to yield higher returns. Three projects stand out in this context: Best cryptos to buy now ahead of altseason breakout. Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) As altcoin season builds momentum and market optimism grows, Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) is gaining massive traction through its ongoing token presale. With a major announcement coming out on June 30, investors have a limited window to join early before the token launches. Bitcoin Pepe is merging two powerful forces: increasing Bitcoin adoption and the explosive profit potential of meme coins. The project is a layer-2 solution built directly on Bitcoin to utilize its $2 trillion dormant capital across various sectors. Bitcoin has gained both popularity and the trust of investors, but its applications are still limited due to its slow speed and scalability. Bitcoin Pepe, with its revolutionary PEP-20 token standard, is addressing this problem. The platform is bringing what some have referred to as “Solana on Bitcoin.” So, now investors can enjoy the unmatched security of the BTC network with the speed and functionality of Solana. Bitcoin Pepe will enable the launch of meme coins on the Bitcoin network, and according to experts, this could be a hundred-billion-dollar market in itself. The project has already attracted big crypto whales, raising over $14.6m in just a short period. Currently priced at $0.0416, the BPEP token offers early investors a massive opportunity to invest in what could become the next big thing in the crypto market because of the essential infrastructure in the evolving crypto landscape. Solana (SOL) Solana (SOL) is the sixth-biggest cryptocurrency with a market value of $80.59 billion. As profit booking hits the crypto market, the Solana price has witnessed a 3.89% drop in the weekly timeframe. CoinMarketCap data confirms that the Solana price has been consolidating between $140 and $170. The resistance at higher levels has pulled the SOL to $150. $SOL looking good here. Strong bounce from the key $141 support zone. Expecting bullish momentum towards local range high. Gaining $181 opens the door for a big rally towards $262. pic.twitter.com/Ct28pcN16F — Lennaert Snyder (@LennaertSnyder) June 16, 2025 Nevertheless, analysts say that the Solana price could rise to higher levels in the next few weeks. Technical analyst Lennaert Snyder forecasts that the Solana price might see a strong bounce from the current support level to retest the local target of $181. In the medium-term forecast, he says SOL might reach the $241 target. A new record of 2.07 billion addresses has been added to the Solana network, according to other news. The number of addresses has been steadily rising despite the market’s fluctuations in Solana prices, which means investors are optimistic about a Solana price uptick. Dogecoin (DOGE) Like other major cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin (DOGE) ranks among the most popular crypto projects. However, its origin sets it apart. While Bitcoin and Ethereum started with serious goals, Dogecoin began as a meme or joke. Despite this lighthearted start, it quickly gained value and built a strong following among crypto enthusiasts. Image Courtesy: TradingView However, due to broader market uncertainty, Dogecoin has experienced considerable intraday swings in the past few days. After a 2.4% decline today, the DOGE price is currently $0.17. The MACD oscillator indicates increasing bullish pressure for Dogecoin. The RSI stands at 38, which shows the dominance of bears in the meme coin. If bulls take control and push the DOGE price above the immediate resistance at $0.21, it may trigger a trend reversal. Subsequently, a breakout from the upper trendline of the wedge pattern could spark another surge in the DOGE price. On the other hand, if the $0.17 support fails, Dogecoin could plunge to $0.15. Hottest altseason gem for 2025 As the altcoin season gains momentum, astute investors have started their hunt for the next mega winner. Whale support and economic tailwinds are shifting, and most importantly, projects with strong utility are gaining the most traction. Investors looking for strong prospects are picking up Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) for its attractive infrastructure, which is transforming how Bitcoin can be used beyond simple transactions. The project’s strong real-world application has attracted a phenomenal $14.6m.

2025-06-18T11:26:47,"Bitcoin (BTC) Could Reach $205K in 2025 if Historic Growth Cycle Holds","Macroeconomic uncertainty gripped markets after US President Donald Trump threatened Iran’s supreme leader, which caused Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to drop in response. Despite this, BTC may be on track for significant gains in 2025 if it follows its long-established yearly performance pattern, according to new analysis of long-term price cycles. BTC on Track for 120% Gain in 2025? Data shows that since 2011, Bitcoin has followed a recurring four-year rhythm – three years of upward growth followed by one year of consolidation – mirroring the cryptocurrency’s halving cycle. With 2023 and 2024 already closing as positive years, 2025 would represent the third and typically strongest year in the cycle. If this historical trend continues, BTC’s price could rise by roughly 120% by the end of 2025, according to the latest analysis by CryptoQuant. Starting from a base of $93,226, that would take the leading cryptocurrency to around $205,097, which could potentially mark the cycle’s peak. The analysis stated that Bitcoin is now in the final bullish phase of its current cycle, which may have important implications for investor strategy and timing. The latest prediction stands in contrast to the often short-term focus of on-chain metrics like MVRV ratios, UTXO bands, and SOPR readings, which, while valuable, can miss the broader structural forces shaping price action, CryptoQuant’s analysis explained. Meanwhile, the long-term view is further supported by Realized Cap data, which continues to print new all-time highs this year, indicating steady market strength. “Bitcoin adheres to a structural rhythm that repeats with striking consistency: three years of expansion followed by one of compression. This long-term lens helps investors stay grounded during short-term volatility and align better with Bitcoin’s historical performance.” Strong Institutional Interest in Bitcoin This long-term optimism is mirrored in institutional behavior, with continued capital inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs despite the broader market pullback. Data from SoSoValue revealed that these funds recorded $216 million in net inflows on June 17th, which marked seven straight days of inflows. Interestingly, more than $1.46 billion was added over the last five trading sessions.

2025-06-18T11:22:20,"CZ Declares Fundraising as ‘Blockchain’s Killer App’ After SaharaAI’s $75M Win","The post CZ Declares Fundraising as ‘Blockchain’s Killer App’ After SaharaAI’s $75M Win appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Changpeng Zhao, better known as CZ, is making headlines again. The former Binance CEO and crypto pioneer says fundraising is blockchain’s true “killer app.” He shared this in a recent post on X, responding to SaharaAI’s massive $75 million, and that’s stirred plenty of buzz across the crypto space. As the U.S. government leans more pro-crypto and the market shows signs of revival, CZ’s comment feels timely. And from his latest ventures to Binance’s current path under CEO Richard Teng, CZ’s influence on the industry is far from over. SaharaAI’s Big Win: Blockchain’s Fundraising Potential CZ made his comment after @buidlpad highlighted SaharaAI’s fundraising numbers – $16 million in BNB and $59 million in USD1, a USD-pegged stablecoin built on BNB Chain and linked to Trump-aligned World Liberty Financial. The raise beat expectations by a staggering 777%. Our $SAHARA Community Distribution saw another ATH for Buidlpad Over $74.5M was committed, overshooting our target by 777%. 103,000+ user subscriptions 30,000+ KYC-verified contributors from 118 countries $59M in USD1 and $16M in BNB were contributed by our… https://t.co/U5yGYb7FsY — Buidlpad (@buidlpad) June 17, 2025 “This is a great showcase of its strong utility,” @buidlpad tweeted. CZ replied to the post, though he later deleted his comment. Still, the message landed: blockchain is proving its strength in areas like capital raising, not just payments or transactions. From Binance to Giggle Academy: CZ’s Next Mission Since stepping down from Binance, CZ has shifted focus toward education. He launched Giggle Academy , a free online learning platform offering math, English, and blockchain courses to underserved kids in developing countries. While serving a four-month prison sentence in 2024 over charges from the DOJ and SEC, CZ also began writing a book. It combines his personal story, the early days of blockchain, and how Binance came to be. The manuscript is still in the works and is expected to give readers a deeper look into the world he helped build. Richard Teng Backs Bitcoin’s Role in the Future Binance’s current CEO, Richard Teng, is also confident in crypto’s future, especially Bitcoin’s. He recently called it the flagship crypto and a “resilient store of value” in times of economic uncertainty. Teng believes that with growing institutional interest and friendlier U.S. policies, Bitcoin will keep rising in importance, acting as digital gold in diversified portfolios and playing a larger role in global finance. The Bigger Picture With Changpeng Zhao’s fundraising announcement and Teng’s Bitcoin predictions, a new chapter is growing in the crypto world. SaharaAI’s success showcases blockchain’s power, while CZ’s efforts in education and writing will keep his legacy alive. The crypto community is watching closely, waiting to see what’s next in CZ’s story.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/cz-declares-fundraising-as-blockchains-killer-app-after-saharaais-75m-win/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|BNB","News",cryptocompare
2025-06-18T11:15:50,"Coinsilium raises £4M via oversubscribed Bitcoin retail offer","Coinsilium just revealed that it conducted a retail offer through the Winterflood Retail Access Platform (WRAP) at 22.2 pence per share to consolidate its Bitcoin purchasing campaign. The company initially targeted £2.5 million but had to quickly expand due to high demand. The offer was ultimately expanded to £4 million (approx. $5.4 million) after it was oversubscribed by as much as 400%. Coinsilium Group Limited (AQUIS: $COIN – OTCQB: $CINGF ), the Web3 investor, advisor, and venture builder, is pleased to confirm the result of its retail offer via the Winterflood Retail Access Platform (“WRAP Retail Offer”), at 6 pence per share (“Issue Price”). The Company has… pic.twitter.com/NtrMpNufhT — Coinsilium (@CoinsiliumGroup) June 2, 2025 Coinsilium goes big on Bitcoin accumulation The UK-based company raised £4 million by issuing 18,018,018 new ordinary shares that are expected to be admitted to trading on the Aquis Growth Market around June 23, 2025. After admission, Coinsilium will have 359,477,274 ordinary shares, each with one voting right. However, there will be no shares held in its treasury. The new shares are expected to be on the same level as existing shares and free of any hindrances. However, not all investors were allowed to participate. According to the document released by Coinslium, the offer was not available in the US, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Japan, South Africa, or EEA member states due to legal restrictions. It also highlighted Peterhouse Capital Limited as the Aquis Stock Exchange Growth Market corporate adviser, and Winterflood Securities Ltd as the manager of the WRAP platform. While the announcement includes forward-looking statements, it does not offer any assurances on actual results. As such, any investor interested should be aware that share value and income are not guaranteed and may fluctuate. Coinsilium entered BTC with £1.25 million raise in May The recently concluded retail offer from Coinsilium comes after the company raised £1.25 million earlier on May 15, 2025, to initiate its Bitcoin strategy. The newly raised funds will support the Bitcoin treasury strategy via its subsidiary, Forza Gibraltar Limited. According to recent reports, the subsidiary has been actively accumulating Bitcoin , and as of June 16, reportedly holds 25.2 Bitcoins in its treasury, including a recent purchase of 6.5577 Bitcoins at an average price of £77,770 ($105,572.30). Coinsilium’s subsidiary, Forza Gibraltar Limited, reports it holds 25.2 Bitcoins in its treasury as of June 16. Source: Forza Bitcoin The total value of holdings now sits at around £1,519,242.90 ($2,054,113.50). In response to the Bitcoin treasury update and WRAP retail offer announcement, Coinsilium’s share price shot up by 91% on June 16, with record trading volume of over 29 million shares on Aquis and 6 million on the US OTC market (CINGF). The trading activity is proof that investors, particularly among retail investors in the UK, are excited about the opportunity to get exposed to Bitcoin, specifically via Coinsilium’s offering. While Coinsilium has become one of the latest companies to transition into a Bitcoin-focused treasury operator, it is not the only one. The success of its retail offer also shows that UK-listed firms can realistically consider adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset with great success. Aside from Coinsilium, other companies that have also opted to adopt similar strategies include The Smarter Web Company, which raised £29 million via the WRAP platform and Helium Ventures.

2025-06-18T11:15:00,"Crypto Daybook Americas: Bitcoin Holds the Line as Trump Labels Iran Leader ‘Easy Target’","By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin (BTC) is hovering a smidgen under $105,000 having dropped just 1.4% in the past 24 hours as crypto markets balanced the Israel-Iran war with regulatory progress in the U.S. Tensions in the Middle East are heightening after President Donald Trump called for Iran’s “unconditional surrender” after saying the country’s leader was an “easy target.” Corporate bitcoin buying, however, is underpinning demand, and Senate approval of U.S. stablecoin legislation is seen as a win for the industry . Trump's words helped raise the perceived odds of the U.S. entering the conflict to 62% on prediction market Polymarket , up from around 50% a day ago . The perceived odds of U.S. military action against Iran before August are at 73%. “Despite escalating tensions in the Middle East, BTC is yet to show signs of full-blown panic,” analysts at crypto hedge fund QCP Capital wrote . “BTC’s resilient price action appears underpinned by continued institutional accumulation.” That accumulation is partly driven by corporate bitcoin treasuries. Strategy, for one, has added over 10,000 BTC with funds from the STRD preferred stock offering, and The Blockchain Group said it added 182 BTC this week. Bitcoin rewards firm Fold has secured a $250 million facility to spend on bitcoin, while Mercury Fintech is planning on raising $800 million for a bitcoin treasury. “The market seems to have rediscovered its footing, particularly after BTC held above the key psychological threshold of $100k despite the initial shock,” QCP’s analysts said. “Crucially, Friday’s modest 3% pullback paled in comparison to April last year, when BTC fell more than 8% amid similar Iran-Israel turmoil.” Deribit’s BTC Volatility Index ( DVOL ) is currently around 40.86, down from over 62 in early April. The Senate's approval of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, the first major piece of crypto legislation to clear the chamber, sends a clear message: U.S. lawmakers are increasingly open to formalizing rules for the industry. Markets interpreted the move as a structural win. Traders will be watching today’s interest-rate decision from the Federal Reserve for any surprises. According to the CME’s FedWatch tool, markets are nearly certain rates are going to remain unchanged. That amplifies any fallout from the Iran-Israel conflict, which has now entered the crypto space. The Iranian crypto exchange Nobitex was hacked by a group thought to be linked to Israel just a day after the same group targeted the state-owned Bank Sepah. And in the wider sphere, Iran closing the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial shipping lane, or the U.S. intervening would likely lead to a risk asset sell-off. “It’s wise to reserve judgement until the U.S. open, where most price discovery has been occurring,” said Jake O., an OTC trader at Wintermute.

INK will be airdropped to early users, with the foundation pledging measures to limit airdrop farming and maintain long-term alignment. The token has a fixed cap of 1 billion and won’t be subject to governance changes or emission tweaks — a move to avoid common dilution concerns. Governance of the Ink layer 2 remains separate from the INK token, differentiating it from other Superchain projects that often intertwine protocol and token governance. The first utility will be a native liquidity protocol for lending and trading, serving as a foundational DeFi building block on the Ink chain. INK will debut amid weak market conditions, with most 2024–25 L2 token launches underperforming as the hype subsides. Examples include Celestia, Linea, and Blast. Ink’s DeFi activity remains minimal, with just $7 million in TVL and under $100 in daily revenue — raising questions about product-market fit despite its ""product-first"" narrative. Derivatives Positioning Perpetual funding rates for major coins are barely positive, indicating a renewed caution among traders. BTC and ETH futures basis on the CME remains steady at around 7% and 8%. Short-term options on Deribit show a bias for protective puts. Top five most traded BTC options on Deribit are all put options at strikes ranging from $90K to $100K, indicating heightened demand for downside protection.
