2025-06-18T10:57:59,"100,000 TPS and 150% Launch Returns: Why Bitcoin Solaris Is Crushing Solana Price Prediction Models","The post 100,000 TPS and 150% Launch Returns: Why Bitcoin Solaris Is Crushing Solana Price Prediction Models appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Crypto markets in 2025 are no longer buying into branding alone. After years of buzzwords and speculative whitepapers, investors are now watching real-world metrics, tech delivery, and access. Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is emerging as the altcoin that checks every box: high throughput, minimal entry barriers, and tokenomics that work in reality. The project’s eighth presale phase is currently open at $8 per token, with over 11,500 participants contributing more than $4.5 million so far. And as the exchange listing benchmark nears $20, early buyers stand to gain 150% just on launch pricing alone — before market growth even begins. Solana’s Ceiling Becomes Bitcoin Solaris’s Floor Solana rose on the promise of speed and scalability. It delivered—but also ran into network congestion, hardware reliance, and centralized validator criticism. Bitcoin Solaris takes a different route. Its dual-layer chain includes a hybrid Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Capacity base layer, combined with a Solaris Layer running Proof-of-History and Proof-of-Time. The result? A network that handles over 100,000 transactions per second with two-second confirmation times. Better yet, the energy consumption is nearly negligible — down 99.95% compared to traditional mining systems. Where Solana requires major hardware and technical setup, BTC-S invites everyday users through mobile-based contribution. It isn’t competing with Solana’s past—it’s building the protocol many expected Solana to become. Audited Infrastructure, Public Team, Live Participation This isn’t a roadmap with deadlines that may never arrive. Bitcoin Solaris has already completed a full smart contract audit via Cyberscope , and the mining logic was independently verified by Freshcoins . The development team also completed KYC verification , giving a rare layer of accountability during the presale phase. The Nova App — now rolling out after successful beta testing — lets users mine from modern smartphones, contributing idle CPU and storage to help validate the chain. There’s no need for validators, staking platforms, or complicated setup. Participation is real, and results are already being measured. BTC-S Supply Strategy: The Hidden Value Trigger Out of a hard-capped 21 million BTC-S tokens, only 4.2 million are designated for presale. That allocation includes all public rounds — there are no backdoor minting mechanisms or developer wallets waiting to unlock. This one-time distribution model mirrors Bitcoin’s early economics, where entry price and contribution, not institutional leverage, shaped outcomes. As each presale phase fills, price and difficulty both increase. With current buyers entering at $8 and exchange benchmarks set around $20, timing isn’t just a preference — it’s an advantage. Analysts Shift Focus to Bitcoin Solaris Prominent crypto analyst Ben Crypto recently spotlighted Bitcoin Solaris in a detailed YouTube breakdown. He emphasized how BTC-S aligns structurally with early Bitcoin, not in branding, but in protocol utility, audit trail, and retail inclusion. The momentum is clear — BTC-S offers upside without relying on narratives alone. Solana’s price has plateaued amid validator concentration and performance inconsistencies. Bitcoin Solaris, meanwhile, has created traction on proof, not promises. Closing Window, Expanding Opportunity As Bitcoin Solaris moves through its final presale stages, the ability to enter below market becomes less about opportunity and more about urgency. Entry at $8 may not carry the return potential of earlier phases, but with 150% still on the table pre-launch — and a live network already in motion — the case remains strong. Bitcoin Solaris represents a challenge to the entire legacy structure of crypto development: a project that launched with function first, transparency second, and wealth-building tools for users, not just insiders.

2025-06-18T10:53:24,"Bitcoin (BTC) Price Could Soon Witness a Strong Jump & Hit $110K—Here’s Why","The post Bitcoin (BTC) Price Could Soon Witness a Strong Jump & Hit $110K—Here’s Why appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin is currently trading around $105K, having edged down about 1.4% today after peaking near $106.5K. The recent aftermath of geopolitical tensions, especially in the Middle East, and a cautious macroeconomic outlook have driven mild risk-off sentiment. Yet, technical indicators such as Bollinger Bands expansion and a positive MACD histogram hint at an imminent surge in volatility that could fuel a breakout. Will this, can the BTC price reclaim $108K? Massive Bullish Bitcoin Signal Tether has been mining new tokens very frequently in recent times, which has been heavily contributing to the volatility within the markets. Each time Tether minted a billion tokens, the Bitcoin price witnessed a significant push. The price rebounded from the local bottoms and surged to reach the local highs or even an ATH. The data from Lookonchain suggests Tether has minted another billion, which could be considered a huge bullish signal. In the past few weeks, the BTC price has experienced a significant rise following two Tether-minted USDT. Therefore, now that the USDT has minted one more billion tokens, there is a huge possibility of Bitcoin triggering a strong upswing. The US has just passed the new Stablecoin bill, or the GENIUS Bill, which is expected to shake up Tether’s dominance in the market. With the tighter regulations coming, USDC and the other stablecoins could gain ground. Despite this, the USDT maintains stability at $1, solidifying its position with a $155.58 billion market cap. One of the major reasons behind the stability could be the influx of new USDT tokens into the market. Will the BTC Price Rise Again? Bitcoin price has held strongly above the crucial support at around $102.8K as it has revived a strong rise, soon marking the bottom. Currently, the price is facing a huge compression with the long/short ratio almost 50/50, which opens both the possibility of a breakout and a breakdown. Therefore, a confirmation of any trend could depend on the price deviating either above $107K or dropping below $103K. However, in the wider perspective, the Bitcoin price is at the neckline of a huge bullish structure, and hence, a breakout could propel the token to a new ATH.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-btc-price-could-soon-witness-a-strong-jump-hit-110k-heres-why/,"BTC|MARKET|MINING|TRADING|USDT","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-06-18T10:47:54,"$1 Billion USDT Minted Ahead of FOMC Meeting Today","The post $1 Billion USDT Minted Ahead of FOMC Meeting Today appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News MisterCrypto unveiled an exciting bullish news for Bitcoin price and the broader crypto market. Today, as FOMC meeting approaches, prior to this meet a staggering $1 billion worth of USDT was minted on Ethereum. This significant influx of cash coming into the world’s largest stablecoin clearly a pivotal moment for Bitcoin, especially if the Federal Reserve decides to cut interest rates. Such a move might elevate the price’s of risky assets, including pumping BTC into a price discovery phase. The news was confirmed via Lookonchain’s official X account, which noted that in the past, similar USDT minting events led to substantial Bitcoin price surges. MisterCrypto pointed out that despite the prevailing bearish sentiment fueled by geopolitical tensions, Bitcoin could potentially soar to $140,000. This has left many investors wondering: can Bitcoin really rise amidst the current panic? Keep reading to know more to this minting event and what it could mean for Bitcoin’s future. Why Bitcoin Price Poised For A Rise? Yesterday, the US posted a fierce teaser to Iran to submit to the US. The Truth Social post starting with “unconditional surrender!” from Donald Trump’s official account is indicative that the Israel-Iran conflict has disturbed the US, and the president intends to stop it. Therefore, combined with the FOMC meeting and potential improvements in geopolitics with Iran surrendering to the US, it will be an ultra-bullish factor for the most-watched crypto sector lately.

NEW: Gemini has filed a scathing complaint against the @CFTC Enforcement Division, accusing it of waging a 7-year campaign of “lawfare” against the crypto exchange. Instead of going after real wrongdoers, Gemini says, the CFTC sued the exchange and relied on testimony from a… pic.twitter.com/ABWKaaH0j9 — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) June 17, 2025 The 13-page complaint , filed on June 13 with Inspector General Christopher Skinner, alleges that enforcement lawyers “ selectively and unfairly weaponized ” federal law to bring “ dubious false statements charges ” against the Winklevoss twins’ exchange. Despite all these, the CTFC never produced evidence of intentional wrongdoing throughout seven years of investigation and discovery. Gemini Paid $5M Settlement to CTFC, Then Came After Falsehood The scathing allegations come just months after Gemini paid a $5 million settlement in January 2025 to resolve a case allegedly stemmed from a “ lie-riddled whistleblower submission by a discredited former employee ” seeking revenge after being terminated for facilitating fraud. GEMINI SETTLES WITH CFTC FOR $5M OVER 2017 BITCOIN FUTURES SCUFFLE So, Gemini’s taking a $5M hit to settle with the CFTC after some shady 2017 claims. The CFTC accused the Winklevoss-led platform of misrepresenting stuff when trying to get their bitcoin futures contract… pic.twitter.com/YS9yhaKudZ — Mario Nawfal’s Roundtable (@RoundtableSpace) January 6, 2025 The complaint names nine specific CFTC enforcement lawyers, including Manal Sultan, K. Brent Tomer, and David Oakland, accusing them of pursuing fabricated claims driven by “ selfish desire to advance their careers ” rather than principled law enforcement. Gemini argues that the entire investigation originated from false allegations made by former Chief Operating Officer Benjamin Small, who was fired in 2017 for his role in a $7.45 million rebate fraud scheme perpetrated by customers Hashtech LLC and Cardano Singapore. A 2022 arbitrator ruling found that Small “ fraudulently procured his employment ,” “ lied repeatedly about his experience ,” and made false statements in his whistleblower submission. Yet, the CFTC continued pursuing Gemini while taking no action against Small, who may now receive a $1.5 million whistleblower award. From Victim to Target: How a Fraud Case Became a Regulatory Nightmare The origins of Gemini’s regulatory ordeal date back to summer 2017, when the exchange fell victim to a sophisticated multi-million dollar rebate fraud orchestrated by two customers working in coordination with Benjamin Small, then the exchange’s Chief Operating Officer. Small was aware of the substantial losses but failed to stop the fraudulent trading and attempted to conceal the scheme from Gemini founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. Upon discovery of the fraud, Small and other complicit employees were immediately terminated for cause, while Gemini successfully sued the perpetrators and recovered all improperly earned rebates totaling 388 bitcoin and $1.7 million. Rather than accepting responsibility for his role in the fraud, Small embarked on what he described as a vindictive campaign to “destroy” Gemini Trust, filing false whistleblower reports with the CFTC in late 2017. His allegations centered on claims that Gemini had omitted material information in statements to regulators regarding the exchange’s bitcoin auction pricing mechanism and its susceptibility to manipulation. The CFTC enforcement division “immediately and unquestioningly embraced” Small’s false claims, launching an investigation in early 2018 with what Gemini describes as a “predetermined outcome” to sue the exchange. Letter from J. Baughman to CFTC Inspector General Source: Eleanor Terrett More damning still, a 2022 JAMS arbitrator rendered a $5 million judgment against Small, delivering a “ scathing decision ” that found he had fraudulently obtained his employment, was terminated for gross negligence, and had lied repeatedly throughout his career. Regulatory Double Standards and Prosecutorial Misconduct Gemini’s complaint reveals disturbing selective enforcement where the CFTC ignored actual criminals while pursuing dubious charges against the exchange. Despite clear evidence of intentional fraud by Hashtech, Cardano, and co-conspirators, enforcement lawyers chose not to prosecute these wrongdoers, instead planning to use testimony from admitted criminals against Gemini. The enforcement division employed abusive litigation tactics, embracing an “ extraordinarily broad view ” of deliberative process privilege to deny Gemini access to potentially exculpatory evidence. This approach created what Acting Chairman Pham has warned against: a situation where defendants are “ presumed guilty with no way to prove innocence .” Crypto exchange Gemini is on the verge of obtaining a license in Malta, while Luxembourg is gearing up to grant a license to Coinbase, according to a report. #Coinbase #Gemini #MiCALicense https://t.co/WRQ1YhAMiG — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 16, 2025 The timing of the complaint proves particularly significant as it coincides with Gemini’s ambitious expansion plans, including a confidentially filed IPO registration with the SEC and reported progress toward securing a Malta license for pan-European operations under new EU crypto regulations.

The company suspended all access immediately after detecting the breach and said its internal security teams are closely investigating the extent of the incident. According to ZachXBT, the exchange appears to have been exploited for $81.7M on the Tron network, Bitcoin , Doge, and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible blockchains after suspicious outflows were observed from many linked wallets.

The firm noted that the incident only affected some of the assets in hot wallets. The crypto exchange said it accepts full responsibility for the incident and assured users that all damages will be compensated through the insurance fund and Nobitex resources. Nobitex also confirmed that its website and app are temporarily unavailable until a full review is completed. On-chain data from Tronscan identified an address where the first $49 million was stolen. The pro-Israel hacker group Gonjeshke Darande, or “Predatory Sparrow,” claimed responsibility, stating the attack is retaliation for Nobitex’s alleged role in terrorism financing and sanctions evasion. The group also threatened to release Norbitex’s source code and internal information from their internal network in 24 hours. The hacker group argued that Iran’s dependence on Nobitex is evident from the fact that working at the exchange is considered valid military service since it is considered vital to the regime’s efforts. The hackers also warned that associating with regime terror financing and sanction violation infrastructure puts the company’s assets at risk. According to blockchain security firm CertiK, the breach adds to a growing list of crypto industry hacks this year. The company found that over $2.1 billion in digital assets had been exploited in 2025. “The majority of this $2.1 billion was caused by wallet compromises, key mismanagement, and operational issues.” -Ronghui Gu, Co-founder of CertiK. Gu also noted that social engineering scams, such as address poisoning, are now more common than protocol-level hacks. The attacks rely on psychological manipulation to trick users into transferring assets to fraudulent wallets. Pro-Israel hackers breach Bank Sepha Gonjeshke Darande also said Tuesday that it is behind a series of cyberattacks against Iran’s Bank Sepha. The pro-Israel hacking group’s attack would mark the first major cyberattack on critical infrastructure during Israel’s war with Iran. The group argued that the financial institution circumvented international sanctions and used the people of Iran’s money to finance its terrorist proxies, its ballistic missile program, and its military nuclear program. According to local media outlets, Bank Sepha’s customers have reportedly been facing problems with accessing their accounts, making withdrawals, and paying with their cards. Iranian state media also warned that the disruptions could impact the country’s gas stations, which rely on the bank to process transactions. Iran’s central bank spokesperson is also quoted as telling state-run IRNA that all banking operations are running smoothly and providing service to their customers. The bank has not yet commented publicly on the attack, which happened after some people in Tehran evacuated overnight following President Trump’s ominous warning. The pro-Israel group has previously bragged and shared videos of attacks on Iranian steel mills and successfully shut down the country’s railway system, computers, and gas stations. Former cyber director at the National Security Agency, Rob Joyce, acknowledged that the group’s past cyber attacks on Iranian steel plants and gas stations demonstrated tangible effects in Iran. He argued that disrupting the availability of the bank’s funds or triggering a broader collapse of trust in Iranian banks could have major impacts in Iran . The U.S. Treasury Department also sanctioned Bank Sepha in 2018 for supporting Iran’s Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-06-18T10:41:17,"Tether just minted 1 billion USDT; What does it mean for Bitcoin price?","On June 18, Tether minted $1 billion worth of USDT on the Ethereum blockchain, according to on-chain data from Arkham Intelligence. Historically, such minting events have coincided with short‑term surges in Bitcoin ( BTC ). Notably, on May 21, when Tether issued $2 billion USDT, the next day BTC broke its previous all‑time high, climbing past $111,000. While minting alone doesn’t guarantee immediate impact, the available on-chain data reveals that major spikes in USDT supply often translate into large inflows to exchanges. Bitcoin price after USDT mint. Source: @Lookonchain How will the mint affect Bitcoin price Research suggests that Bitcoin often reacts positively in the short term following large Tether mints, particularly when on-chain alert accounts like Whale Alert publicly flag the transactions. An article by Dr. Aman Saggu in Blockchain Research Lab found that Bitcoin tends to rise 0.4–0.8% within 5 to 30 minutes after a USDT mint. The response is asymmetric: mints push prices up, while burns have little to no effect. The study, which reviewed minting and burning across Tether blockchains from 2014 to 2021, attributes the price movement to investor psychology, specifically FOMO during bullish sentiment phases. Crucially, the effect is only observed once a mint is announced by Whale Alert or a similar service, suggesting the move is driven more by visibility and sentiment than by actual liquidity impact.

2025-06-18T10:37:26,"Internet Computer (ICP) integrates Solana to create multi-chain apps","The Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) will integrate Solana in an attempt to create multi-chain apps. ICP has already integrated Bitcoin and Ethereum, and is capable of hosting DeFi projects at a lower cost, while tapping the liquidity in those networks. Dfinity Foundation, the creator and major contributor to the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) announced the integration of Solana onto the ICP chain. The new integration uses ICP’s Fusion technology, allowing the protocol to connect to some of the world’s most active public blockchains. “By bridging the gap between Solana and ICP through Chain Fusion, we are granting developers with powerful new tools to build next-generation dApps that unify speed, security, and decentralization in one seamless experience, essentially dissolving the barriers that limit blockchain innovation,” said Jan Camenisch, Chief Technology Officer at Dfinity. The integration of Solana means that the native smart contracts of ICP, known as canisters, can interact with the other chain and fuse DeFi with seamless performance and security. The technology removes the need for a bridge, which is one of the riskiest and most attacked types of smart contracts. Canisters are a form of smart wallets, which allow the reading of addresses and the distribution of funds based on predetermined permission settings. The Chain Fusion technology will enable app builders to launch on ICP without a need for a full migration. This will allow the growing user base of ICP to tap external DeFi liquidity, with higher speed and at a lower cost. Solana apps can also use the efficient on-chain processing of ICP, instead of adding another off-chain component. Dfinity aims for decentralized Internet ecosystem The integration of multiple public chains marks another step for Dfinity toward building a decentralized Internet ecosystem. The fusion of chains will open up additional Web3 opportunities for both projects and end users. The fusion will open up ICP to a potential 4.8M daily active users, after the recent growth of Solana due to meme token and DEX activity. ICP also has a limited DeFi sector, with just under $30M in total value locked, but the chain is suitable to host already established apps in DEX trading and lending. The chain also carries around 297 BTC in wrapped form, also used for DeFi security. Currently, ICP carries around 9K in daily internet identities or active users, based on Token Terminal data . The chain has around 5.3K daily unique active wallets. For now, it remains uncertain which apps will use both chains for their activity. ICP currently trades at around $5.12, within its middle range for the past month. The chain is currently ranked in 190th place based on its activity and apps , while hosting a handful of native projects with their own tokens. Despite its relatively low rank, ICP is one of the growing chains in 2025, aiming to revive its activity during the current bull market and increased demand for Web3 activity. ICP has raised $167M in multiple high-profile ranks, backed by a16z and Polychain Capital. The chain has been through several market cycles since its inception in 2018, and aims to tap the currently hot chains for DEX and lending activity.

2025-06-18T10:30:41,"Bitcoin Volume Surges 100% Amid War Threats – What To Expect","Amid the chaos that was sparked by Israel’s attack on Iran, Bitcoin has climbed again, shaking off the losses triggered by the conflict. Not only has the price seen an increase from its last week’s lows, but there has also been a notable change in the cryptocurrency’s daily trading volume. This points to continued interest despite global factors and could mean that the expectations of war are already getting priced in for the crypto market. Bitcoin Sees Almost 100% Jump In Volume According to data from Coinglass, there has been a turn in the tide for the Bitcoin trading volume after starting out the new week in a slow trend. Sunday and Monday had seen the Bitcoin daily trading volume come out under $50 billion. However, as the Bitcoin price rose leading up to Tuesday, so did the trading volume. Related Reading: What Are The Implications For XRP If Ripple Captures 14% Of SWIFT’s Volume? At the time of writing, the Bitcoin daily trading volume had already crossed $88 billion for Tuesday, leading to an almost 100% increase in the trading volume during this time. This follows the trend of high volatility coming with increased volumes as the Bitcoin price swung wildly between $105,000 and $108,000. The sharp jump in volume comes as the Bitcoin open interest remains high at near all-time highs while the rest of the market struggles. Coinglass data shows the current open interest at $71 billion, less than $10 billion away from the $80 billion all-time high recorded in May 2025. In light of altcoins continuing to trend low while Bitcoin remains close to all-time highs, it suggests that most of the attention in the crypto market is now being focused on Bitcoin. As a result, the leading asset continues to dictate the direction of the market, with dominance remaining high above 64%. How War Could Affect This Trend The positive developments surrounding Bitcoin are coming as there seems to be a cooldown in the conflict in the Middle East. But with so little time having passed, expectations are that the war may only be starting, with some calling it the start of ‘World War 3.’ Related Reading: Key Fractal From 2023 Says Bitcoin Price Is Still Bullish, But A Crash To $90,000 Could Be Coming The Kobeissi Letter has taken to X (formerly Twitter) to address these World War 3 predictions, revealing how the markets would react if there really was a possibility of this happening. The first thing was that a 50% chance of World War 3 would’ve seen the S&P crash not 2%, but more of a 30% crash. Gold would be $5,000/oz, and oil would go for $100/barrel. Furthermore, a 90% chance of World War 3, as explained in the post, would likely cause the S&P to crash 50%, with the prices of gold and oil surging to $10,000/oz and $200/barrel, respectively. Given Bitcoin’s correlation with the stock market so far, there is no doubt that such a crash would have carried over, triggering disastrous losses for the crypto market. Given these, The Kobeissi Letter explains that the markets are saying the chances of World War 3 are slim. At this time, they expect a resolution to the conflict. “Futures all around the board this morning saw de-escalation coming,” the post read.

2025-06-18T10:30:26,"US Spot Bitcoin ETFs See Remarkable $217M Inflows, Signaling Strong Demand","BitcoinWorld US Spot Bitcoin ETFs See Remarkable $217M Inflows, Signaling Strong Demand The crypto market continues to capture significant attention, and recent movements within US spot Bitcoin ETFs are providing valuable insights into investor sentiment. On June 17, these investment vehicles experienced another day of positive activity, extending a notable trend. Understanding the Latest Bitcoin ETF Inflows According to data shared by Trader T (@thepfund) on X, US spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively saw a net inflow of $217.37 million on June 17. This figure is significant as it marks the seventh consecutive trading day where more money flowed into these funds than out. This sustained period of positive flow suggests continued, albeit sometimes moderate, demand for exposure to Bitcoin through regulated and easily accessible ETF products. Breaking Down the $217.37M Inflow Figure While the overall picture for Bitcoin ETF inflows was positive, the performance varied significantly among individual funds. Here’s a look at how the major players fared on June 17: ETF Ticker Issuer Net Flow (June 17) IBIT BlackRock +$640.07 million FBTC Fidelity -$208.46 million ARKB Ark Invest / 21Shares -$191.40 million BITB Bitwise -$22.84 million Other ETFs Various $0 million (no net change) As the table clearly shows, the net positive figure was heavily influenced by one dominant player. BlackRock IBIT Leads the Way BlackRock’s Ishares Bitcoin Trust ( BlackRock IBIT ) was the standout performer on June 17, attracting a massive $640.07 million in net inflows. This single fund’s performance more than offset the outflows seen by several other prominent ETFs, underscoring BlackRock’s continued success in attracting investor capital into its Bitcoin product. IBIT has consistently been a leader in accumulating Bitcoin since its launch in January, and this latest inflow reinforces its position as a preferred vehicle for many investors seeking exposure to the digital asset. What About Other Key Bitcoin ETFs? While BlackRock IBIT saw substantial inflows, other major Bitcoin ETFs experienced outflows. Fidelity’s FBTC had a net outflow of $208.46 million, followed by Ark Invest and 21Shares’ ARKB with $191.40 million in outflows, and Bitwise’s BITB with $22.84 million in outflows. The remaining spot Bitcoin ETFs available in the U.S. market reported no net change in flows for the day. These outflows from some funds, even on a day of overall positive inflows, highlight that not all investors are uniformly bullish or are potentially rebalancing their portfolios. It’s a reminder that while the overall trend of Bitcoin ETF inflows has been positive recently, the market dynamics for individual funds can vary. What Do These Inflows Mean for the Crypto Market? The consistent streak of net inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs , now stretching to seven days, is generally interpreted as a positive signal for the broader crypto market . It indicates continued institutional and potentially retail interest in gaining exposure to Bitcoin through regulated investment products. Benefits of this trend include: Signaling Demand: Sustained inflows demonstrate underlying demand for Bitcoin. Market Maturation: The success of these ETFs points to the increasing maturation and acceptance of Bitcoin as an investable asset class within traditional finance. Potential Price Support: While not a direct price driver in isolation, consistent buying pressure from ETFs can contribute to positive price momentum for Bitcoin over time. However, it’s important to consider nuances: Varied Performance: As seen, not all funds experience inflows equally; some face significant outflows. Market Context: ETF flows are just one factor influencing the complex crypto market , which is also affected by macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, and global events. Actionable insights for investors might include monitoring these flow trends as one data point among many when assessing market sentiment and potential price direction, but avoiding making decisions based solely on daily flow figures. Conclusion: A Positive Streak for US Spot Bitcoin ETFs The seventh consecutive day of net inflows for US spot Bitcoin ETFs on June 17, totaling $217.37 million, underscores a period of renewed positive sentiment and demand for Bitcoin exposure via these regulated products. While outflows from some funds like FBTC and ARKB present a more nuanced picture, the significant inflows into funds like BlackRock IBIT paint an overall positive trend for Bitcoin ETF inflows and provide a constructive signal for the broader crypto market .

2025-06-18T10:30:26,"Stablecoin Regulation Bill Nears Passage In Senate, Trump’s Crypto Holdings Unaddressed","The US Senate is reportedly poised to approve significant legislation regulating stablecoins. This bill, known as the GENIUS Act—an acronym for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins”—marks a pivotal moment for the crypto industry as it seeks to gain legitimacy and instill confidence among consumers. The legislation will soon move to the House for potential amendments. Bipartisan Support Grows For Stablecoin Regulation According to Fortune, eighteen Democratic senators have joined their Republican counterparts in supporting the GENIUS Act, which is expected to pass with a narrow 53-47 majority. If approved, this would represent the second major bipartisan measure to advance through the Senate this year, following the Laken Riley Act addressing immigration enforcement. Senator Angela Alsobrooks, a Democrat from Maryland, expressed optimism about the bipartisan effort, noting, “We weren’t able to include everything we would have wanted, but it was a good bipartisan effort.” She emphasized the importance of regulating an area that has previously been unregulated. One notable provision within the GENIUS Act prohibits members of Congress and their immediate families from profiting off stablecoins, although this restriction does not extend to the president and his family. Notably, this aspect has raised eyebrows, especially as President Donald Trump expands his involvement in the crypto space . Recently, Trump hosted a private dinner at his golf club with investors in a Trump-branded memecoin and has a significant stake in World Liberty Financial (WLFI), which has launched its own stablecoin, USD1. ‘Super Highway For Corruption’ While the crypto industry views this legislative effort as a bipartisan achievement, the bill has faced challenges along the way. Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott, a Republican from South Carolina, noted, “The GENIUS Act will be the most significant digital assets legislation ever to pass the US Senate.” However, the bill encountered setbacks earlier this month when a group of Senate Democrats withdrew their support, prompting renewed negotiations among Senate Republicans, Democrats, and the White House. Despite these efforts, unresolved concerns regarding presidential conflicts of interest linger, particularly among Democratic lawmakers. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a vocal critic and the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, has cautioned that the bill could create a “super highway” for potential corruption linked to Trump. The senator, who is known for her anti-crypto stance , also expressed concern about major tech companies, such as Amazon and Meta, introducing their own stablecoins. Should the Senate pass the stablecoin legislation, it will still face significant hurdles in the House, where the Republican majority may seek to attach broader market structure provisions to the bill. This could complicate its passage and delay its arrival at the president’s desk.

2025-06-18T10:20:17,"BTCI: Earning Yields From Bitcoin Without A Bull Thesis","Summary BTCI lets you earn monthly income from Bitcoin exposure without needing a bullish thesis, using covered call and spread strategies on partial spot and synthetic holdings. Holds ~25% in spot Bitcoin ETP and remaining in futures/synthetic positions for tax efficiency and simplified 1099 filing—no K-1s, and capital gains are internally handled. Upside is only partially capped via call spreads, and BTCI offers some drawdown protection and lower volatility, suitable for neutral-to-mildly-bearish market views. Compared to similar funds like YBTC or YBIT, BTCI tracks Bitcoin more closely, offers better long-term upside potential, and hasn’t compromised NAV with aggressive payouts. I am not a bitcoin expert. My analysis of the NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF ( BTCI ) will be purely from an agnostic income generation strategy perspective. Which is fair because if I were to have a thesis on bitcoin, I would play bitcoins directly. The reason I evaluate BTCI is because I am seeking income. Of course there are tactical uses of BTCI that could come up which requires view on the underlying's next move. Those general characteristics of the ETF will be covered. Methodology and What to Expect The ETF works by holding ~25% of assets as spot Bitcoin ETP via a Cayman subsidiary and replicates synthetic positions through bitcoin futures of synthetic futures (an option setup that replicates the futures). his underlying holding structure makes for better tax efficiencies. Unlike many crypto and crypto adjacent fund themes, BTCI does not issue additional K-1 forms for tax compliance. There is one simplified 1099 form that is issues and makes tax handling easier for investors. BTCI also pays capital appreciation taxes on mark to market gains reducing your tax filing to only when there is a payout or withdrawal. But my understanding points to filing efficiencies over tax savings. After taking the cash position, BTCI employs call writing structures (including call spreads if appropriate) on the underlying and aims to generate income over the underlying. Expect this structure to cap upside and reduce drawdowns (but limited to premiums received). Such a structure works out well if the underlying moves flat or corrects. Over a long term, the upside opportunity loss is far higher than the income gains. However BTCI's call spreads do capture a part of the upside. It may manage to create a case for reduced volatility risk adjusted returns. NAV and Yield BTCI is a relatively new income play on bitcoins and shows around ~20% yield. That is not too aggressive and gives a chance for the NAV to retain its levels or even grow if the underlying appreciates. Aggressive payouts are often NAV eroding in nature and shrink future payouts in an absolute sense. Is Bitcoin as Volatile as It Sounds? There was an era when Bitcoin was rallying by leaps and bounds and corrections were extreme as well. That era of volatility appears to be behind us as Bitcoins have matured. Now bitcoins are no more volatile than say a Palantir. Not docile enough compared to Google or a broad index ETF like QQQ. But sufficient volatility to be earn more premiums on wins to be able to offset single large losses. It is not as volatile as MSTR as well to make winning difficult. Too high volatility is a killer for option strategies as managing option sell structures become difficult. Either ends up in large opportunity losses or large drawdowns, sometime both. Bitcoin qualifies with just the ideal amount of volatility today to attempt option writing on. Data by YCharts Comparison with Bitcoin In the relatively short period of existence, BTCI shows underperformance against bitcoins (proxied as IBIT), particularly since the period of analysis has been largely bullish. That's expected. The underperformance is not huge either given the quantum of upside within a short period of time. Data by YCharts Zooming into the only significant drawdown period for Bitcoin, the limited drawdown protection is evident for BTCI. This is decent delta saved on drawdowns but not large enough to offset the upside opportunity losses. There is a case for BTCI on drawdowns, but not strong. Data by YCharts Comparison with Other Bitcoin Income ETFs I will compare BTCI's total returns against YBTC and YBIT , two other income generating bitcoin based ETFs. Both have a similar proposition, but for no physical holdings in Bitcoin (which BTCI has), fully capped upside (BTCI has partial upside exposure through spreads) and much more aggressive payouts. YBIT has started to drag from potential payout pressures. But between YBTC and BTCI, the latter is the more aggressive total growth vehicle i.e. it tracks Bitcoin more closely. Higer upsides can be captured at times (not always) through BTCI, but there is no great downside excess vs YBTC. If we see the performance graphs, the one time upside gained in BTCI in November 2024 is more or less retained throughout since. That is the spread at work - capturing big upsides at speed, but not always. Data by YCharts Data by YCharts Final Call - Buy BTCI BTCI's structure shows ability to closely track bitcoin while reducing downsides a bit. Its drawdown performance is not great but provides cushion even if limited. The upside opportunity loss is not as great as in the case of YBTC (YBTC will likely manage drawdowns slightly better although not much evidence so far). If you are bullish Bitcoins even after the last rally, buy Bitcoin. The use case for any option income generator like BTCI appears when you want to tactically use it for a bearish to flat view. The other use case is to generate income without having to actively manage payouts from a core Bitcoin holding. I rate BTCI a buy among the alternative option writing strategies on Bitcoin. If you value downside reduction far more than growth and are looking for steady yields prefer BTCI in your portfolio. For aggressive income de-risking you from Bitcoins quicker and better volatility management, YBTC could make the cut also. But so far, BTCI even over YBTC till new patterns emerge.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4795642-btci-earning-yields-from-bitcoin-without-a-bull-thesis?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","BTCI",cryptocompare
2025-06-18T10:20:07,"Bitcoin’s Explosive Potential: LTH Selling Signals Major Bull Run","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Explosive Potential: LTH Selling Signals Major Bull Run Are we on the cusp of another significant move for Bitcoin ? Recent observations from prominent crypto analysts suggest that key market participants, specifically Long-Term Holders (LTHs), are exhibiting behavior historically associated with periods preceding substantial price increases. This fascinating insight, derived from on-chain data, offers a compelling look into the underlying conviction of those who have held onto their Bitcoin through thick and thin. What Are Bitcoin Long-Term Holders (LTHs) and Why Do They Matter? In the world of Bitcoin , holders are often categorized based on how long they’ve kept their coins. Short-Term Holders (STHs) typically hold Bitcoin for less than 155 days, often being newer market entrants or traders. Long-Term Holders (LTHs), on the other hand, are wallets that have held their Bitcoin for 155 days or longer. This distinction is crucial because LTHs represent the ‘strong hands’ in the market – those with high conviction who are less likely to sell during minor dips or volatility. Their selling or accumulation patterns can provide significant clues about the overall market sentiment and potential supply dynamics. When LTHs sell, it can indicate profit-taking or capitulation. When they stop selling or even accumulate, it often signals confidence in future price appreciation and can lead to a supply squeeze on exchanges, potentially driving prices up. Understanding the behavior of this cohort is a cornerstone of effective crypto analysis . Decoding the Bullish Signal : LTH Selling Reaches Historic Lows According to crypto analyst Axel Adler Jr., the current selling activity from Bitcoin Long-Term Holders is approaching levels rarely seen before. This means that despite market fluctuations, the most experienced and conviction-driven holders are choosing not to liquidate their positions. This lack of selling pressure from a group that holds a significant portion of the circulating supply is inherently bullish. Think of it this way: if the people who bought Bitcoin months or years ago, potentially at much lower prices, are holding onto their coins instead of cashing out, it suggests they believe the price is headed significantly higher. This collective decision by LTHs reduces the available supply on the market, especially on exchanges, making it easier for new demand to push the Bitcoin price upward. Past Performance: How Bitcoin Price Reacted to Similar LTH Behavior One of the most compelling aspects of this observation is its historical context. The analyst points out that there have been only four previous instances where LTH selling reached such low levels. The results following three of these four instances were remarkably consistent and positive for the Bitcoin price . Instance 1: LTH selling hits low. Instance 2: LTH selling hits low. Instance 3: LTH selling hits low. Instance 4 (Current): LTH selling hits low. In the three preceding cases, Bitcoin experienced price gains ranging from 18% to 25% within a relatively short timeframe of six to eight weeks. While past performance is never a guarantee of future results, this recurring pattern provides a strong historical precedent for expecting a positive price reaction in the near future based on the current LTH behavior. This historical data is a critical component in performing thorough crypto analysis . Supporting Evidence: Other Bullish Signals from On-Chain Crypto Analysis The positive outlook isn’t solely reliant on LTH behavior. The analyst’s update also highlighted other key on-chain metrics that are flashing green. Two notable examples are Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) and Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV). Coin Days Destroyed (CDD): This metric gives more weight to coins that haven’t moved for a long time. A low CDD value indicates that older Bitcoin (held by LTHs) is not being spent or moved. Currently, low CDD values reinforce the observation that LTHs are holding, reducing selling pressure and indicating conviction rather than distribution. Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV): This ratio compares the current market price (Market Value) to the average purchase price of all coins (Realized Value). It helps identify periods where Bitcoin might be overvalued or undervalued relative to the cost basis of its holders. An MVRV ratio typically below 1 suggests undervaluation (though we are likely above 1 now, the *trend* and specific levels within a cycle are key). Bullish signals often emerge when MVRV is recovering from lower levels or consolidating at levels historically seen before price rallies, indicating that the market as a whole is not yet excessively profitable, thus reducing the incentive for widespread selling. The confluence of these metrics – low LTH selling, low CDD, and favorable MVRV trends – paints a cohesive picture of a market structure that appears primed for potential upward movement, according to this crypto analysis perspective. Beyond the Data: Current Bitcoin Market Trends While on-chain data provides invaluable insights into holder behavior, it’s also important to consider the broader market context. We are currently operating within a post-halving environment, a period historically associated with increased scarcity and subsequent price appreciation. Institutional interest remains a significant factor, with ongoing inflows into Bitcoin ETFs providing consistent demand. Macroeconomic factors, while always a consideration, currently see central banks potentially shifting towards more accommodative policies, which could be favorable for risk assets like Bitcoin . However, challenges remain. Regulatory uncertainty in various jurisdictions, potential for unexpected macroeconomic shocks, and the inherent volatility of the crypto market are factors that investors must always keep in mind. A comprehensive approach to understanding the potential trajectory of the Bitcoin price requires looking at both the micro (on-chain) and macro factors. Potential Challenges and Considerations for Your Bitcoin Investment While the signals discussed are undeniably bullish, it’s crucial to approach them with a balanced perspective. Here are some challenges and considerations: Correlation vs. Causation: Historical patterns show correlation, but other factors could have been at play during those past instances. Market Sentiment Shifts: Unexpected news or events can quickly change market psychology, overriding on-chain signals. Global Macro Factors: Significant shifts in interest rates, inflation, or geopolitical events can impact all risk assets, including Bitcoin . Low Selling Doesn’t Equal No Selling: While LTH selling is low, it’s not zero, and large individual holders could still influence the market. Relying solely on one or two metrics, even compelling ones like LTH behavior, is risky. A holistic view incorporating technical analysis, fundamental factors, and overall market sentiment is always recommended for any Bitcoin investment strategy. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Market Based on LTH Data So, what does this mean for you as an investor or someone interested in Bitcoin ? Use it as a Data Point: View the LTH analysis as a strong piece of evidence supporting a potentially bullish outlook, but not the only piece. Consider Your Time Horizon: This signal, historically, points to gains over the next few weeks to months (6-8 weeks according to the analyst). It aligns well with a medium-term bullish perspective. Risk Management is Key: Regardless of bullish signals, never invest more than you can afford to lose. Use stop-losses or position sizing appropriate for your risk tolerance. Stay Informed: Continue to follow other on-chain metrics, technical indicators, and market news. Good crypto analysis is ongoing.

2025-06-18T10:17:20,"Bitcoin 'Accumulator' Better Fit for Corporates Than Dollar-Cost Averaging Strategy, Research Suggests","Corporate adoption of bitcoin BTC is well-known, and most of it involves a classic buy-and-hold strategy, loosely analogous to the dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy. While investors of all kinds widely prefer DCA, new research by crypto options market maker OrBit Markets shows that since 2023, it has underperformed a structured product called an ""accumulator,"" popularly known as ""I Kill You Later"" in traditional markets. ""Our backtest results show that the accumulator strategy outperformed DCA over the past 2.5-year period,"" said Pulkit Goyal, head of trading at OrBit Markets, told CoinDesk. ""Three-month accumulators delivered a 10% outperformance, while longer tenors did even better — six- and twelve-month accumulators outperformed by 13% and 26%, respectively."" Goyal added that accumulators offer a disciplined, cost-effective approach to token accumulation, making them ""a natural fit for crypto treasury companies' use case."" Both DCA and the accumulator operate the same principle – stop timing the market. While DCA simplifies investing by spreading out purchases over time, the accumulator helps acquire coins at a discount in a structured setup and helps outperform DCA during bull runs. Primer on accumulator The accumulator is a time-structured product linked to the performance of an underlying asset with an upside knock-out barrier – level, which, if hit, terminates the structure. Here is how it works: An investor agrees to buy a certain amount of the underlying asset at a fixed, discounted price (the Strike) over regular intervals, such as daily or weekly, for a set period. The product runs through the pre-determined set period unless terminated early due to an early knock-out by the spot price rising to the barrier. Note that the investor has an obligation, not a choice, to buy the asset at the discounted strike price and must double the buy in case the spot price dips below the discounted strike. Example of BTC accumulator Consider a three-month accumulator where an investor commits to buy $1,000 worth of BTC every week at a strike price of $94,500, with a knock-out level of $115,000. The strike price of $94,500 is 90% of the current spot price of around $105,000. In other words, the investor is now mandated to snap up coins at a discount, assuming the spot price holds above the strike price of $94,500 and below the knock-out of $115,000. If BTC tops the knock-out level, the structure is terminated. If the price falls below $94,500, the investor doubles the weekly purchase to $ 4,000 at the same strike, i.e., $94,500 – there is no way out, meaning the investor ends up buying at a price higher than the prevailing market rate. (this is why it gets the nickname ""I kill you later."") Hence, the accumulator is not suitable for day traders, short-term traders and speculators and may not necessarily outperform DCA in a bear market. Backtesting OrBit backtested a three-month BTC accumulator, spanning from January 2023 to June 13, 2025, assuming the investor continuously rolled into a new one upon reaching maturity or a premature knock-out event. Results show an average BTC acquisition cost of $39,035 for the accumulator, which is 10% lower than the DCA average purchase price of $43,329. The DCA involved investing a fixed dollar amount in BTC every week. Longer maturity accumulators of 6 and 12 months performed even better, achieving average costs of $37,654 and $32,079, respectively, outperforming DCA by 13% and 26%.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/18/bitcoin-accumulator-better-fit-for-corporates-than-dollar-cost-averaging-strategy-research-suggests,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH","Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Institutions|market analysis|Bitcoin Treasury Reserve Asset|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-18T10:17:19,"Spokane bans crypto kiosks amid surge in ATM scams","In a unanimous vote on Monday, the Spokane City Council approved an ordinance banning all crypto kiosks within city limits. The decision comes amid rising numbers in crypto ATM scams. Spokane is the first city in Washington state to enact such legislation. According to the Spokane Journal, there have been several reported crypto kiosks scams. Those kiosks are often located in gas stations, grocery stores, and convenience stores, where unsuspecting individuals are tricked into sending money via digital currencies. The machines resemble traditional ATMs but do not dispense cash; instead facilitate the buying and selling of virtual currencies like Bitcoin . Spokane council bans crypto kiosk over a surge in scams According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Americans lost approximately $5.6 billion in cryptocurrency kiosk-related fraud in 2023. In Washington state alone, victims lost a staggering $142 million. Citing these statistics, Spokane leaders have banned the digital currency kiosks “to protect residents from becoming easy targets.” “ This ordinance will protect vulnerable Spokane residents from scams involving virtual currency kiosks, and I am proud we are the first city in the state to move this legislation forward ,” Council Member Paul Dillon said in a statement . Dillon co-sponsored the ordinance alongside Council President Betsy Wilkerson. Detective Tim Schwering of the Spokane Police Department, who has investigated numerous cases tied to crypto ATM fraud, coined the term “crypto ATM fraud ” to describe the machines as tools that scammers use to exploit trust and urgency. “ They’re scamming people, saying that they need to move their money into cryptocurrency in order to protect it. And by the time the money is into the cryptocurrency, it’s already too late ,” Schwering asserted. He mentioned that recovering the funds is nearly impossible once transferred overseas. Spokane’s new law could stop new machines from being installed and mandate the removal of all existing cryptocurrency kiosks throughout the city. According to Councilman Dillon, many of these machines are found in low-income neighborhoods, accessible to populations most at risk of financial exploitation. “ There are lots of vulnerable populations that are being preyed upon by these types of machines ,” Councilman Zack Zappone said during the meeting. “ So this is really making sure that we’re taking safeguards for folks in our community so that they don’t get preyed upon and lose a lot of their savings or cash in these machines .” US states with laws against crypto kiosks Alongside Washington’s Spokane, several US states have introduced or passed legislation to fight fraud tied to digital currency machines. In North Dakota , lawmakers passed House Bill 1447, a legislation that would impose a $2,000 daily transaction limit and require warning labels on all crypto kiosks. Additionally, the bill includes licensing and quarterly reporting requirements for businesses running such machines. Nebraska enacted the Controllable Electronic Record Fraud Prevention Act in March. The law requires crypto ATM operators to be licensed and sets a maximum fee cap of 18%. It also enforces a $2,000 daily transaction limit for new users and mandates full refunds if fraud is reported within 90 days. Arizona has also taken steps to regulate crypto ATM operations following an uptick in fraudulent cases. On November 13, Attorney General Kris Mayes wrote a letter asking businesses in Yavapai County to support the sheriff’s office in preventing crypto kiosk scams. In May, Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs signed House Bill 2387, sponsored by Rep. David Marshall of Snowflake, limiting transactions to $2,000 per day for new users, while increasing the cap for existing customers to $10,500. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

This strategic move significantly enhances global accessibility to Bitcoin-backed loans for institutions and individual users, powered by advanced mobile solutions and innovative products. Why This Launch Matters Debifi’s exit from beta marks a strong validation of its non-custodial lending infrastructure. Operating with limited capacity during the beta phase, the platform saw over $20 million worth of loans originated by third-party institutional lenders over a 12-month period. What began with just two lenders has expanded to a network of over 30 institutions – including Berglinde and STOKR – with 3 to 5 new institutional lenders joining the platform each month. With loan application volume on the platform growing between 50 -100%, Debifi is now targeting a 15 – 20x increase in lending activity over the next year. Revolutionizing Bitcoin Lending The official release of Debifi’s iOS and Android mobile applications significantly enhances platform accessibility and user experience. The updated iOS app introduces cutting-edge features such as TAPSIGNER integration, a comprehensive public offers list, streamlined KYC processes, an informative Explore tab, intuitive in-app filters, and a refreshed user interface designed for seamless interaction. Debifi Cards Enters Closed Beta In a major product milestone, Debifi has launched a closed beta of its new Debifi Cards – bringing Bitcoin-backed microlending to everyday users. The cards offer small, flexible credit lines without compromising Bitcoin custody, expanding the practical use of Bitcoin as collateral. Verified Security Debifi upholds a rigorous commitment to security and transparency, having successfully completed three independent security audits including the latest by a leading blockchain security firm, Certik. The platform’s architecture is built on multisig escrow technology and follows a strict no-rehypothecation policy, ensuring client assets remain secure and verifiable at all times. Advisory Council Expansion As part of its institutional growth strategy, Debifi is proud to welcome Willy Woo, one of the most respected macro and on-chain Bitcoin analysts, to its Advisory Council. Woo joins Preston Pysh, a prominent Bitcoin educator and co-founder of The Investor’s Podcast Network. Together, they bring unparalleled market insight, macro perspective, and long-term vision to support Debifi’s mission of making Bitcoin the premier collateral asset in global credit markets. Comments from Leadership and Partners Debifi has signed two strategic partnership agreements – with The Bitcoin Adviser and Finpeers – to expand into new markets. Max Kei, CEO of Debifi: “The last 12 months were a controlled rollout phase, proving the model with minimal tooling and just two lenders. Exiting beta with over $20 million in loans issued shows real demand. Now, with global scale, full mobile support, and institutional capital, we’re building the gold standard for Bitcoin-backed lending.” Peter Dunworth, CEO of The Bitcoin Adviser: “Access liquidity without giving up your Bitcoin or compromising your custody. Debifi delivers smart lending solutions for long-term Bitcoin holders – Bitcoin-backed loans aligned with your estate and wealth preservation strategy. Self-custody meets financial flexibility, powered by Debifi and advised by The Bitcoin Adviser.” Finpeers CEO Sander Andersen : “At Finpeers, we see strong and growing interest from family offices in Bitcoin-related strategies – particularly those that combine yield with downside protection. Our partnership with Debifi enables us to provide access to overcollateralized Bitcoin-backed loans, offering an attractive entry point for investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin without holding it directly. This structure creates an opportunity to generate fiat returns through a conservative, well-collateralized framework – bridging traditional capital with the Bitcoin ecosystem.” Strategic Goals Product Innovation : Expand the suite of Bitcoin-backed credit products, including the Debifi Cards and enhanced mobile capabilities, to meet diverse market needs.

2025-06-18T10:03:55,"Wall Street Coming Onchain as JPMorgan Launches First Banking Token JPMD on Base","Wall Street banking giant JPMorgan is taking its biggest step yet into public blockchain technology with the launch of its digital deposit token “JPMD” on Coinbase’s Base network. The move follows a June 15 trademark application for “JPMD” and will begin with a pilot phase transferring tokenized U.S. dollar deposits from JPMorgan’s wallet to Coinbase. JPMD is fully backed one-to-one by U.S. dollars and will initially be available to institutional clients only. Pending regulatory greenlight, broader access and support for additional currencies are expected. JPMD: JPMorgan’s Blockchain-Backed Answer to Stablecoins JPMD is structured as a permissioned digital deposit token, distinguishing it from fully decentralized stablecoins like USDT or USDC. In a June 17 report from Bloomberg, JPMorgan explained: The bank sees the token as a safer and compliant alternative to stablecoins, particularly at a time when traditional financial institutions are grappling with increasing competition from crypto-native payments and tokenized assets. This isn’t JPMorgan’s first entry into blockchain. The bank already operates Kinexys, an in-house blockchain-based platform processing over $2 billion in daily tokenized payments, including foreign exchange and derivatives transactions. Nelli Zaltsman, Head of Platform Settlement Solutions at Kinexys by JPMorgan, just shared insights on the groundbreaking collaboration between JPMorgan x Chainlink | $LINK x Ondo | $ONDO — and what it means for the next wave of financial infrastructure.

Why JPMorgan Chose Coinbase Base for JPMD: A Middle Ground Blockchain Rather than deploying JPMD on Ethereum or other fully permissionless networks, JPMorgan opted for Base, a Layer 2 blockchain developed by Coinbase. J.P. Morgan is bringing banking onchain. Kinexys by @jpmorgan is launching JPMD, a USD deposit token for institutional clients, on Base. It will be the first token of its kind on a public blockchain, enabling fast, secure, 24/7 money movement between trusted parties. — Base (@base) June 17, 2025 While public, Base is only partially decentralized and governed by a Security Council, offering a structure that traditional financial institutions find more palatable. This setup provides an avenue for communication and intervention, two things regulators and banks often find lacking in fully decentralized networks. Base’s design presents a “middle path” between permissionless blockchains and private ledgers, which may help banks address regulatory scrutiny while taking advantage of public chains’ innovation. JPMD’s launch comes just a day after the U.S. Senate passed the long-awaited GENIUS stablecoin bill . Already, some institutions in various regions are reportedly witnessing outflows as clients migrate to digital alternatives that offer 24/7 settlement and lower transaction friction. Source: VanEck Matthew Siegel With stablecoins gaining traction as viable payment tools, tokens like JPMD may help banks defend their turf by offering compliant, blockchain-native alternatives under regulated frameworks. JPMorgan’s Rapid Blockchain Expansion in 2025 JPMorgan’s Base experiment follows a string of blockchain-related developments in 2025. Earlier this month, the bank began allowing select clients to use crypto ETFs, including BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), as loan collateral. JPMorgan Plans to Let Clients Borrow Against Crypto ETFs – Here’s What That Means JPMorgan Chase & Co. will allow select trading and wealth clients to use cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as collateral for loans, according to a report by Bloomberg published on June… — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 6, 2025 It also announced plans to let clients buy Bitcoin, although custody will remain off-limits . CEO Jamie Dimon, previously a vocal crypto skeptic, acknowledged during a recent investor briefing : “ We’re going to allow you to buy it. We’re not going to custody it, but it’ll be in statements for clients. ” Adding fuel to this shift, a February 13F filing revealed a 69% jump in JPMorgan’s Bitcoin-related holdings, rising to $964,322. The bank increased its IBIT exposure to 5,242 shares and boosted its position in Fidelity’s FBTC fund by 208%, signaling deeper institutional conviction in digital assets. As real-world assets, from equities to bonds to currencies, move on-chain, traditional players are adapting their infrastructure to remain competitive in the digital era.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Goldman Sachs loads up on safe, regulated Bitcoin ETFs, crypto-native whales are chasing bolder bets, like APORK, a memecoin mixing virality with real utility. Table of Contents Why does Goldman Sachs bet on the BTC ETF? What is it about APORK that attracts the Telegram Whales? In February 2025, we saw that Goldman Sachs make a significant investment in Bitcoin ETFs, as it increased its holdings in the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) by 28%. For a firm that manages billions in client capital, Bitcoin ( BTC ) via ETF is the safest way to offer exposure in the crypto market to its consumers. Why does Goldman Sachs bet on the BTC ETF? Because it is most likely a safer bet. It’s regulated by the SEC, and the assets are custodied by trusted third parties like Coinbase. In fact, everything from liquidity to tax treatment is structured in a way that they don’t touch private keys. And they do it all in clean, auditable ways. For firms as large as Goldman Sachs, it’s about parking large amounts of money into an asset they believe is now legitimised. In fact, in early June, we saw that the Bitcoin ETF surged past $70 billion in assets under management (AUM), reaching the milestone in just 341 trading days. Source: https://x.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1932119109476687884 But the Telegram whales, or the big analysts that assess communities of fast-moving private groups filled with crypto-native players, don’t have to stick to less risky assets just to play it safe. Many are leaning toward something much louder, faster, and looser: memecoins with utility, like APORK .

What we have seen over the years is that whales don’t have compliance departments and don’t need to wait for ETFs. What they care about is multipliers, narrative momentum, early access, and spotting trends. What makes it stand out? Its core idea is to build a memecoin that monetizes attention, not just speculation. APORK does this through three layers of engagement: Meme culture: It uses humor, branding, and virality to attract attention. Through GambleFi games, staking, deflation, and reward tiers, it ensures users have reasons to stay. With CommunityFi, users earn coins for holding and for spreading the word and adding value to the community. This trifecta makes APORK a hybrid: part meme, part GameFi, part DeFi. Solana’s memecoin sector exploded in late 2023 and early 2024 thanks to the platform’s ultra-low fees, fast confirmation times, and strong Telegram-native community support. But most of these coins were short-lived pumps with no real matter. There were very few coins that timed its virality right in the markets. In this sense, APORK could be: Solana’s first GambleFi-meme hybrid A blueprint for sustainable memecoin design As the Solana market shows maturity and saturation of old memecoins, it surely looks like Angry Pepe Fork could be the one to pump up the markets again.

2025-06-18T10:00:00,"Mobile Mining Revolution: Bitcoin Solaris Presale Offers 150% Returns While Bitcoin Price Prediction Shows Stagnation","The crypto world has long praised Bitcoin for pioneering decentralized finance, but today, innovation is moving faster than Bitcoin’s momentum. A new wave is crashing through space, and at the heart of it is Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S), the first high-performance crypto ecosystem with true mobile mining potential. While traditional forecasts for Bitcoin show conservative returns and steady, if slow, growth, Bitcoin Solaris is setting off fireworks across the blockchain sector with its high-speed architecture, smart tokenomics, and explosive community response. Bitcoin: A Legendary Asset, But Losing the Race? There’s no denying Bitcoin’s dominance. As the original cryptocurrency, it laid the foundation for everything that followed. But the same features that made it revolutionary are now holding it back. Limited TPS (transactions per second), lack of true scalability, and energy-intensive mining systems have sparked growing concerns, even among its staunchest supporters. Price predictions for Bitcoin show moderate gains, with some experts pointing to market saturation and regulatory tightening as reasons why Bitcoin may not offer the wild growth of earlier years. It remains a store of value, but no longer the rocket ship of opportunity. Bitcoin Solaris Is Breaking Every Limit Enter Bitcoin Solaris : a dual-layer blockchain combining Proof-of-Work and Delegated Proof-of-Stake in a hybrid architecture. While Bitcoin is bogged down by legacy limitations, BTC-S has been engineered to overcome them all. With an innovative consensus model, the Base Layer ensures security using SHA-256 PoW (compatible with standard Bitcoin mining hardware), while the Solaris Layer delivers blazing speed and efficiency via a DPoS system rotating 21 validators every 24 hours. The result? Up to 100,000 TPS with 2-second finality on the Solaris Layer Energy-efficient, scalable architecture Optional privacy via Zero-Knowledge Proofs Validator integrity through daily rotation and performance-based slashing Secure cross-layer synchronization and real-time block finality This architecture enables smart contracts to operate with lightning speed, supporting real-world use cases like tokenized real estate, DeFi platforms, gaming, and even healthcare solutions. Developers can build using Rust and Solana tools, while users enjoy mobile-first accessibility, especially with the exciting release of the upcoming Solaris Nova app that will let users mine directly from their smartphones, no expensive rigs required. Mobile Mining and Wealth Building for the Masses One of the biggest crowd-pullers is mobile mining. Through the Solaris Mining Calculator , users can estimate their earnings based on device power, participation time, and network activity. This innovation unlocks crypto income for millions who previously couldn’t afford high-end GPUs. Coupled with Bitcoin Solaris’s community-focused reward model, where Contribution Score, device type, and participation time impact rewards, it creates a sustainable and fair mining economy that’s accessible to all. No GPUs, No Gatekeepers Bitcoin Solaris Puts Power in Your Hands Real Growth, Real Hype With a unique mix of performance, accessibility, and decentralization, it’s no surprise that over 11,500 users have already joined the Bitcoin Solaris presale. The project has raised more than $4.5 million and is gaining major traction online. Two major crypto influencers Ben Crypto and 2Bit Crypto , have both released detailed breakdowns explaining why Bitcoin Solaris is shaping up to be one of the most exciting launches of the year. In fact, Bitcoin Solaris has successfully passed audits by both Cyberscope and Freshcoins , further boosting community confidence. One of the Shortest Presales in History There are fewer than 7 weeks left in one of the fastest-moving crypto presales we’ve seen. Now in phase 8, the current price sits at $8, but the launch price is $20, meaning those getting in now could see a potential 150% return before it even hits the market. Each phase is timed, and the bonus structure only lasts until the next price jump. With the clock ticking and momentum rising, it’s no wonder many are calling Bitcoin Solaris the most promising crypto of 2025. Another reason the hype hasn’t slowed? The seamless mobile mining launch and the growing Bitcoin Solaris ecosystem are opening new doors for passive income in a way Bitcoin never could. Why BTC-S Might Be the Future As legacy networks like Bitcoin continue to serve as slow-moving stores of value, Bitcoin Solaris is redefining what a modern blockchain should be: scalable, sustainable, and inclusive.

2025-06-18T09:45:58,"Gemini slams CFTC over alleged misconduct, calls seven-year probe baseless","The Winklevoss twins-owned crypto exchange Gemini has filed a formal complaint against the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), pushing back against a legal battle from 2022. In a recently submitted 13-page letter to CFTC Inspector General Christopher Skinner, Gemini accused the agency’s enforcement division of waging a years-long “lawfare” campaign driven by litigators’ personal ambition rather than public interest. The dispute stems from the 2022 lawsuit filed by the CFTC against Gemini . At the time, the agency claimed that the exchange made misleading statements back in 2017 about how its Bitcoin ( BTC ) auction prices could be manipulated, resulting in a $5 million settlement. You might also like: “Regulators aren’t easy”: Acting CFTC Chair warns crypto firms against rule-bending under Trump Era According to Gemini, the CFTC’s case was based on false allegations from a former employee who was on a mission to “destroy” the company and was later found to have lied under oath and committed fraud. The exchange added that despite this, the agency pursued the case for years without producing any evidence of actual wrongdoing or market harm. “It did not matter that Gemini Trust was, in fact, the victim of fraudulent activity by multiple bad actors or that the claims against it originated with a lie-riddled whistleblower submission by a discredited former employee. The DOE Staff was willing to burn millions of dollars of taxpayer money to sue an innocent party—all because “victory” would serve their personal interests and agenda,” the letter read. Gemini further argued that the enforcement division strayed from its mission to serve the public’s interest and treat market participants fairly, and instead abused its power. The exchange now calls for internal accountability to straighten out the misconduct, pointing to the calls for reform within the system by the current head of the agency, Caroline Pham. CFTC Acting Chair calls for better regulatory era Since taking office, Pham has advocated for a higher standard of oversight in regulating the crypto industry. According to her, the CFTC “must take a forward-looking approach” to address conflicts of interest and gaps left by the previous administration. Earlier this year, Pham called for a roundtable meeting with industry figures to promote more balanced oversight and constructive dialogue. Her most recent comments came during the Coinbase Annual Summit, where she reiterated the agency’s focus on fair but firm regulations that tackle real concerns. Caroline Pham has also emphasized that the agency will not overlook misconduct, stressing that both service providers and regulators must operate within the law.

2025-06-18T09:45:09,"XRP could be gearing up for a major rally despite weak ETF reaction","XRP price continued to slide for the second straight day despite getting approval for the first spot ETF listing in Canada. According to recent reports, asset manager Purpose Investments has received final approval from Canadian regulators to launch the country’s first spot XRP ETF. Trading for the Purpose XRP ETF will begin on Wednesday, June 18, on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the ticker XRPP. Despite the approval giving Canadian investors an easy and regulated way to access XRP, it didn’t lift sentiment, and the token stayed under pressure. XRP ( XRP ) price dropped 3.4% in the past 24 hours to $2.17, with its market cap falling to $127 billion. The decline came as the broader crypto market cap dropped 3.6% over the past day, with Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other major tokens also sliding amid weak overall sentiment. This was largely driven by heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and growing uncertainty surrounding the U.S. Federal Reserve’s upcoming interest rate decision. Rising inflation risks have dimmed hopes of imminent rate cuts, prompting a risk-off mood across financial markets. You might also like: XRP, SOL ETFs face SEC delay, but approval hopes remain Despite the bearish short-term pressure, several bullish catalysts are emerging for XRP. A recent court filing in the SEC v. Ripple case revealed that both parties have agreed to a $50 million settlement . If approved, this settlement could finally resolve the long-standing legal battle that has overshadowed XRP’s regulatory clarity and hindered its broader adoption. In addition, former CFTC Chair Chris Giancarlo, appointed during the Trump administration, proposed the idea of issuing government bonds for crypto assets such as Bitcoin and XRP. He shared these insights during the XRPL Apex 2025 conference in Singapore, signaling a growing policy shift in favor of regulated crypto finance. Ripple also continues to push forward on product and regional expansion. The company is preparing for the rollout of its RLUSD stablecoin, a key addition to its ecosystem. Simultaneously, Ripple has been strengthening regulatory footholds in key crypto hubs like Dubai and Singapore, which could enhance XRP’s cross-border utility. From a technical standpoint, XRP is forming a multi-month bull pennant pattern on the 1-week/USDT chart. This bullish continuation setup typically precedes a breakout, with price targets based on the length of the initial flagpole. XRP 1-week price, 50-day and 200-day SMA chart — June 18 | Source: crypto.news In XRP’s case, a breakout could project a move to $4.61, representing a 114% gain from current levels. Supporting this thesis, technical analyst Mikybull Crypto drew parallels with XRP’s 2017 chart structure, noting that a similar bull pennant breakout preceded a rally of over 1,300% to all-time highs near $3.40. Momentum indicators, however, present a mixed picture. On the weekly chart, a golden cross has recently formed, with the 50-day SMA crossing above the 200-day SMA, typically a bullish signal suggesting trend continuation. XRP 1-day 50-day, and 200-day SMA chart — June 18 | Source: crypto.news In contrast, the daily chart has turned more bearish. The 200-day SMA has crossed above the 50-day SMA, forming a death cross, which is viewed as a bearish reversal indicator in technical analysis. In addition, both the MACD and RSI are trending lower, reinforcing short-term downside risks. XRP 1-day MACD and RSI chart — June 18 | Source: crypto.news Investor uncertainty was further amplified after the SEC delayed its decision on Franklin Templeton’s proposed spot XRP ETF, extending the review period into late July. The delay, coupled with market-wide caution, has likely contributed to XRP’s underperformance. If XRP loses the key psychological support at $2.00, further downside toward $1.62, its April 2025 low, appears likely before any sustained rebound. Conversely, holding above this level and breaking above the pennant’s resistance could reaffirm the bullish scenario and pave the way toward a retest of cycle highs.

2025-06-18T09:41:57,"Canada-based AgriFORCE launches Bitcoin mining site powered by stranded gas","AgriFORCE Growing Systems Ltd., a Canadian agricultural company, has launched a Bitcoin mining operation in Alberta, powered by stranded natural gas. In its June 17 announcement , AgriFORCE said the site was launched in partnership with energy provider BlueFlare Energy. The site, located in Berwyn, Alberta, is the company’s first operational deployment under its Power & Compute Initiative. It uses 425 kilowatts (kW) of power to support 120 Bitmain S21 ASIC miners, delivering over 32 petahashes per second (PH/s) of computing power. The deployment includes a custom-engineered mining pod with high-efficiency airflow, thermal controls, and BlueFlare’s proprietary telemetry system for performance monitoring. AgriFORCE said the Berwyn facility is powered entirely by stranded natural gas, which is natural gas that cannot be sold or accessed through traditional infrastructure. The site also features BlueFlare’s emissions tracking system, Carbon Cube, to ensure environmental compliance and real-time monitoring. Phase 2 of the project is currently underway and is expected to increase the capacity of the site by an additional 200 kW, bringing the total to over 625 kW. To date, AgriFORCE has mined seven Bitcoin across its Alberta and Ohio operations, valued at roughly $735,000. The company stated it may retain up to 50% of the mined BTC in its corporate treasury, while the remainder will be used to fund infrastructure expansion. You might also like: Tether to start open-sourcing its Bitcoin mining OS It also plans to allocate up to half of its capital raised toward direct Bitcoin purchases as part of its treasury strategy. In addition to the Berwyn site, AgriFORCE signed a binding letter of intent with BlueFlare to deploy two more sites in Alberta, located in Oyen and Hinton. Each of these will replicate the Berwyn model and include modular, off-grid gas-to-power units rated at approximately 640 kW. The new sites will support workloads beyond Bitcoin mining, including AI inference, industrial IoT processing, and edge computing. AgriFORCE aims to scale its operational capacity to over 0.5 exahashes per second (EH/s) by the fourth quarter of 2025, with a long-term target of reaching 1 EH/s by Q1 2026. As Bitcoin mining becomes more energy-intensive, operators are increasingly seeking alternative power sources to reduce costs and improve sustainability. Recent trends point to a move away from coal-based energy sources, with renewable energy adoption among miners growing at an annual rate of 5.8%. Around the world, new initiatives are emerging to support more sustainable mining practices . For instance, earlier this year, United States Senator Ted Cruz introduced the FLARE Act, a bill that offers tax incentives for crypto miners using flared natural gas to power operations. The legislation proposes 100% expensing for systems that repurpose otherwise wasted gas into electricity or computational power. Meanwhile, Pakistan recently announced plans to allocate 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity to Bitcoin mining and AI data centres as part of a broader national strategy to prevent energy wastage and attract tech investment.

2025-06-18T09:40:56,"Altcoin Season Update: Crucial Index Signals Bitcoin Dominance","BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Update: Crucial Index Signals Bitcoin Dominance Are you tracking the pulse of the Crypto Market ? If so, you’ve likely heard of the Altcoin Season Index. This crucial metric offers insights into whether altcoins are broadly outperforming Bitcoin or if Bitcoin is currently leading the charge. The latest reading suggests a significant shift is underway. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index The Altcoin Season Index, tracked by platforms like CoinMarketCap (CMC), is a valuable tool for investors trying to gauge market sentiment and potential trends. But what exactly does it measure? It focuses on the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens. The analysis looks at the performance of these top 100 altcoins relative to Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The index ranges from 1 to 100. Essentially, the index asks: How many of these major altcoins have managed to outperform Bitcoin in the last three months? Altcoin Season vs. Bitcoin Season The index clearly defines the two primary market phases: Altcoin Season: Occurs when at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The index score is typically high (often above 75). Characterized by broad rallies across many altcoins, often seeing significant percentage gains. Bitcoin Season: Occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The index score is typically low (often below 25). Characterized by Bitcoin’s dominance, where BTC might be performing strongly, consolidating, or even dipping, but altcoins are generally performing worse or stagnant. The Current Reading: Altcoin Season Index at 21 As of 00:27 UTC on June 18, the Altcoin Season Index registered a score of 21. This is a slight drop from the previous day’s figure. According to the index’s definition, a score of 21 falls squarely into the Bitcoin Season category. What does this specific number tell us? It means that in the last 90 days, less than 25% of the top 100 altcoins have managed to outperform Bitcoin. The vast majority of large-cap altcoins have either underperformed Bitcoin or seen larger losses during this period. This confirms the market’s current state: Bitcoin is the dominant force, and capital is either flowing primarily into BTC or remaining cautious regarding broader altcoin exposure. This reading is a clear signal to market participants about the prevailing trend. Why Are We Seeing Bitcoin Season Now? Several factors could contribute to the current Bitcoin Season : Post-Halving Dynamics: Historically, Bitcoin often sees a period of consolidation or slower growth after its halving event before potentially resuming an uptrend. Capital might be stabilizing or re-evaluating after the initial excitement. Institutional Inflows: The approval and activity of Bitcoin ETFs in the US have brought significant institutional capital into the market, primarily directed at Bitcoin. This sustained demand for BTC can naturally lead to its outperformance relative to altcoins. Macroeconomic Uncertainty: In times of global economic uncertainty, investors often move towards assets perceived as less risky or more established. Within the crypto space, Bitcoin is often seen as the primary ‘safe haven’ or store of value compared to the more volatile and less established altcoins. Market Consolidation: After periods of significant gains (which some altcoins saw earlier in the year), markets often enter a phase of consolidation where gains are less uniform, and capital might rotate back into the market leader (Bitcoin) before identifying the next potential movers. Understanding these potential drivers helps frame the current index reading within the broader market context. Implications for Cryptocurrency Investing During Bitcoin Season For individuals involved in Cryptocurrency Investing , a market in Bitcoin Season has practical implications: Altcoin Underperformance: Expect many altcoins, especially smaller and less established ones, to struggle to keep pace with Bitcoin, or even decline while Bitcoin holds steady or rises. Increased Volatility for Altcoins: While altcoins are generally more volatile than Bitcoin, this volatility can be amplified during Bitcoin Season, with sharp drops possible. Focus on Bitcoin: Investors primarily focused on riding the dominant trend might allocate a larger portion of their portfolio to Bitcoin. Selective Altcoin Opportunities: Not all altcoins will underperform. Specific sectors or individual projects with strong news, developments, or unique narratives might still see positive price action, but these are often exceptions rather than the rule during this phase. This is a time when careful portfolio management and realistic expectations for altcoin returns are essential. Navigating Bitcoin Season: Actionable Insights How can investors navigate the current Bitcoin Season effectively? Here are a few strategies to consider: Risk Management is Key: Review your portfolio’s altcoin exposure. Is it higher than you’re comfortable with during a period of potential underperformance? Consider setting stop-losses to limit potential downside on altcoin holdings. Avoid taking excessive leverage on altcoins during this phase. Rebalance Your Portfolio: You might consider increasing your allocation to Bitcoin or stablecoins if your goal is capital preservation or riding the BTC trend. Conversely, if you are comfortable with higher risk and believe certain altcoins are undervalued, this period might present accumulation opportunities, but exercise caution. Focus on Fundamentals: During periods of slower price action, focus on the underlying technology, adoption, development progress, and tokenomics of altcoin projects. Strong projects with real-world use cases are more likely to survive and thrive when market sentiment eventually shifts. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on the Altcoin Season Index for potential shifts. Monitor Bitcoin’s price action and overall market sentiment. Follow news related to institutional adoption, regulatory developments, and major project milestones. Approaching the market strategically during Bitcoin Season can help protect capital and position you for future opportunities. When Might Altcoin Season Return? The market is cyclical, and Bitcoin Season doesn’t last forever. What signs might indicate a potential shift back towards Altcoin Season ? Rising Altcoin Season Index: The most direct signal would be the index climbing back above the 25 threshold and heading towards 75. This would show that a growing number of altcoins are starting to outperform Bitcoin again. Broad Altcoin Rallies: Look for sustained positive price action across a wide range of altcoins, not just a few isolated pumps. Increased trading volume in altcoin pairs is also a good sign. Rotation of Capital: As Bitcoin’s rally potentially matures or consolidates at higher levels, capital might begin to rotate out of BTC and into altcoins in search of higher percentage gains. Sector-Specific Strength: Sometimes, a new Altcoin Season is kicked off by strong performance in a specific sector (e.g., DeFi, NFTs, AI tokens) that then spills over into the broader market. Predicting the exact timing is impossible, but monitoring these indicators can help identify when the tide might be turning. Conclusion: Navigating the Current Crypto Market Landscape The Altcoin Season Index currently sitting at 21 is a clear indicator that the market is firmly in Bitcoin Season . This means that, for the time being, Bitcoin is the dominant force, and most altcoins are likely to underperform it. For those engaged in Cryptocurrency Investing , this phase calls for a cautious and strategic approach. Focus on risk management, consider your portfolio allocation, and prioritize understanding the fundamentals of the projects you invest in. While Bitcoin Season presents challenges for altcoin holders, it also offers opportunities for strategic positioning. Stay informed, be patient, and prepare for when the market eventually shifts back towards favoring altcoins.

2025-06-18T09:39:21,"Chinese Bitcoin mining hardware giants are closing in on U.S. markets, what are the risks?","Three Chinese firms that control more than 90% of Bitcoin mining hardware market are reportedly setting up manufacturing hubs in the U.S. as direct result of President Trump’s tariff war. According to a recent report by Reuters, the world’s top three Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining hardware manufacturers, all originating from China, are gearing up to penetrate the U.S. market. The three companies, which are Bitmain, Canaan and MicroBT, have a stronghold on 95.4% of the machinery used in global mining rigs, according to an estimation from Consultancy Frost & Sullivan in 2023 . The biggest firm of the three by sales, Bitmain, had already established U.S. production of mining rigs back in December, right after Trump’s presidential win just a month prior. Meanwhile, Canaan started its initial U.S. production foray in April, aiming to shield itself from Trump’s Liberation Day tariffs . Senior executive Leo Wang said the initiative was a necessary exploration, considering the high tariffs could lead to heavy investments. MicroBT declared in a statement that it is currently trying to implement a localization strategy in the U.S.” to “avoid the impact of tariffs”. You might also like: U.S. vs China: How Bitcoin factors into the trade wars Are U.S. Bitcoin mining rigs in trouble? The strategic move made by each firm signifies their efforts to combat the effect of Trump’s tariffs on overseas imports. By establishing manufacturing bases in the U.S., they could effectively shy away from the tariffs in place for Chinese exports. On the other hand, their presence could potentially raise alarms in the U.S. regarding security concerns held by the federal government against Chinese technology firms, as seen in previous cases involving Chinese manufactured chips and energy-related businesses. U.S. crypto-law attorney, John Deaton, said that U.S. overreliance on Chinese hardware for Bitcoin mining “creates a choke point for U.S. miners.” He said this is because China has the upper hand, in the sense that they could restrict exports or manipulate supply and “disrupt Bitcoin’s network stability and affect U.S. users and investors.” Not only that, local players in the U.S. Bitcoin mining industry have also brought up concerns about Chinese firms coming for the market in the U.S. MARA Holdings-backed U.S. mining manufacturer Auradine is one of the rival companies that are currently lobbying to restrict Chinese supplies to stimulate competition in hardware. Auradine’s chief strategy officer, Sanjay Gupta said that Chinese mining rigs pose a “security risk,” and hundreds of thousands of them are plugged into the U.S. electrical grid. “While over 30% of global Bitcoin mining occurs in North America, more than 90% of mining hardware originates from China representing a major imbalance of geographic demand and supply,” said Gupta. According to the report, China used to dominate the entirety of the Bitcoin supply chain, from rig-making to mining to BTC trading. All of that changed after the Chinese government banned cryptocurrency in 2021 due to financial security reasons. As a result, many Chinese miners, traders and exchanges set up operations abroad. For example, Canaan moved its headquarters to Singapore, though it still has Chinese operations.

2025-06-18T09:38:06,"Is Bitcoin Done Falling? Market Metrics Say the Worst May Be Over","Bitcoin (BTC) has been consolidating over the past few days following a significant correction triggered by geopolitical tensions last week. As the consolidation continues, analysts at the crypto exchange Bitfinex have found reasons to believe that the digital asset may have hit its bottom for this correction. According to the latest Bitfinex Alpha report , market behavior, historical data, and certain metrics, such as Bitcoin Net Taker Volume, suggest that the correction may not extend further than it already has. BTC Reacts to Geopolitical Tensions Last week, BTC started with a strong rebound and recovery from earlier lows. The asset reclaimed key support levels around its previous all-time high (ATH) of $109,900, marking a 4.7% gain from the weekly open. This was supported by a temporary pause in profit-taking activity and improving market sentiment. However, things took a turn for the worse after tensions in the Middle East increased and Israel attacked Iran. BTC experienced a 7.33% peak-to-trough decline, losing much of its early-week gains amid heightened uncertainty in the markets. The cryptocurrency ended the week at 0.09% despite earlier gains. “The swift reversal highlights the marketʼs fragility in the face of exogenous shocks, and underscores how quickly sentiment can shift even during strong trend conditions. Heading into this week, all eyes are on the macro newsflow and whether BTC can maintain support above the $103-105K region,” Bitfinex stated. Is The Bottom In? While global markets continue to react to the effects of ongoing geopolitical tensions, Bitcoin is experiencing a spike in selling activity. This is evident in the Net Taker Volume, a metric that measures the balance between market buys and sells. The indicator has dropped to -$197 million, its most negative level since June 6, which suggests that traders are offloading BTC at market prices rather than waiting with passive bids. Such low readings in Net Taker Volume, especially below -$160 million, have coincided with local BTC bottoms. This is because panic selling exhausts weaker market participants, allowing larger players to accumulate the asset. One more reason for believing that BTC has hit its bottom for this decline is that the magnitude of this plunge closely aligns with the cycle median drawdown of roughly 7%, which is neither extreme nor anomalous. Analysts say this reflects a healthy consolidation phase during an ongoing uptrend rather than the onset of a deeper structural correction and that BTC is likely to recover soon.

2025-06-18T09:30:50,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Navigating the Crucial Shift to Neutral","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Navigating the Crucial Shift to Neutral The temperature of the digital asset world just changed slightly. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a popular barometer for measuring the prevailing emotion in the Bitcoin market and broader crypto space, has taken a notable dip. As of June 18, the index registered a score of 52, marking a significant drop of 16 points from its position the previous day. This movement has pushed the index out of the ‘Greed’ territory it recently occupied and firmly into the ‘Neutral’ zone. But what exactly does this shift in crypto market sentiment signify, and why should you pay attention? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Before we delve into the implications of the recent drop, let’s quickly recap what the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is and how it works. Provided by the software development platform Alternative, this index aims to quantify the two primary emotions that drive investor behavior in volatile markets: fear and greed. The index operates on a simple scale from 0 to 100: 0: Extreme Fear – This suggests investors are overly worried, potentially indicating a buying opportunity for those brave enough. 0-24: Fear 25-49: Neutral – This is where we currently stand. It indicates a lack of strong conviction in either direction. 50-74: Greed 75-100: Extreme Greed – This suggests the market might be due for a correction, as investors could be getting ahead of themselves. The index isn’t just a random number; it’s calculated using a blend of six key factors, each weighted differently to provide a comprehensive snapshot of crypto market sentiment: Let’s break down the components: Volatility (25%): This measures the current volatility and maximum drawdown of Bitcoin compared to its average values over the past 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility often signals increased fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This compares the current volume and market momentum to average values over the past 30 and 90 days. High buying volume in a positive market is a sign of greedy or bullish behavior. Social Media (15%): This factor analyzes posts on platforms like Twitter, looking for specific hashtags related to crypto. It checks the speed and number of posts, alongside sentiment analysis of those posts, to gauge public interest and mood. Surveys (15%): (Currently paused) This component historically incorporated weekly sentiment surveys. While paused, its potential inclusion highlights the value of direct investor opinion. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): This measures Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. Rising Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate fear, as investors might be moving funds out of smaller altcoins and into the perceived safety of Bitcoin. Conversely, falling dominance might suggest increasing confidence in altcoins (greed for higher returns). Google Trends (10%): This analyzes Google search data for crypto-related search queries. Rising search volume for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” or “crypto crash” might indicate fear, while searches for terms like “buy crypto” or specific altcoin names could signal growing interest and potential greed. The Recent Drop: From Greed to Neutral The move from 68 (Greed) to 52 (Neutral) is more than just a number change; it reflects a palpable shift in the collective mood surrounding the Bitcoin market and the wider crypto ecosystem. After a period where the market felt confident, perhaps even overly optimistic, the sentiment has cooled down significantly. What could be driving this change? Several factors might contribute to such a shift: Price Consolidation: If Bitcoin or other major cryptocurrencies have been trading sideways or experienced minor pullbacks after a run-up, this can dampen momentum and volume, impacting two key index components. Lack of Fresh Catalysts: Sometimes, markets cool off simply due to the absence of major positive news or developments that could fuel further price increases. Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Broader economic news, such as inflation data, interest rate decisions, or global geopolitical events, can easily spill over and affect risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies, leading to increased caution. Regulatory Discussions: Ongoing discussions or potential regulatory actions in various jurisdictions can introduce uncertainty, causing investors to become more hesitant. Whale Activity: Large movements of funds by major holders (‘whales’) can sometimes signal potential selling pressure or accumulation, influencing market sentiment. This shift to ‘Neutral’ doesn’t scream panic, but it certainly whispers caution. It suggests that the aggressive buying or strong bullish conviction that characterized the ‘Greed’ phase has waned. Investors are now potentially more hesitant, waiting for clearer signals before making significant moves. Why Does Crypto Market Sentiment Matter? Understanding crypto market sentiment is crucial because emotional biases heavily influence financial markets, especially one as volatile and driven by retail participation as crypto. The old adage, “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful,” highlights the contrarian approach often advocated when using sentiment indicators. When the index is in ‘Extreme Greed’, it might signal that the market is overheated and due for a correction. Conversely, ‘Extreme Fear’ often coincides with market bottoms, presenting potential accumulation zones for long-term investors. The ‘Neutral’ zone, however, is less clear-cut. It represents a state of equilibrium, or perhaps indecision. It can be a precursor to a move in either direction, depending on what catalysts emerge next. It’s a time when the market is catching its breath, potentially consolidating before the next significant trend develops. Navigating the Neutral Zone: Actionable Insights So, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is at 52, sitting comfortably in the ‘Neutral’ zone. What does this mean for you as an investor or trader? Here are some actionable insights, keeping in mind this is not financial advice: Exercise Caution: Neutrality suggests uncertainty. Avoid making impulsive decisions based purely on emotion. Stick to your pre-defined investment strategy. Focus on Market Analysis: This is a good time to dive deeper than just sentiment. Look at technical analysis (price charts, indicators), fundamental analysis (project developments, news), and macroeconomic factors. The index is a sentiment tool, not a complete trading strategy. Prepare for Volatility: The neutral zone can be a period of increased choppiness. Prices might swing back and forth as market participants wrestle for direction. Re-evaluate Positions: Use this calmer period to review your portfolio. Are you comfortable with your current allocations? Is now the time to trim some positions or look for entry points if your analysis supports it? Stay Informed: Keep up with the latest crypto news update. Major news events, regulatory clarity, or technological breakthroughs can quickly shift sentiment out of neutral. Think of the ‘Neutral’ zone as a yellow light. It’s not a red light (stop, extreme fear) or a green light (go, extreme greed, maybe proceed with caution!). It’s a signal to slow down, observe the intersection carefully, and be prepared for potential changes. Challenges and Benefits of Using the Index While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a valuable tool, it’s essential to understand its limitations. Benefits: Quick Snapshot: Provides a simple, easily digestible overview of general market sentiment. Counter-Signal Potential: Can help identify potential contrarian opportunities when sentiment is at extremes. Educational: Helps new investors understand the impact of fear and greed on markets. Challenges: Not Predictive: The index tells you the current sentiment, not where the market will go next. A high ‘Greed’ score doesn’t guarantee a crash, and a high ‘Fear’ score doesn’t guarantee a bounce. Bitcoin-Centric: While it reflects broader crypto sentiment, it is heavily weighted towards Bitcoin data (volatility, dominance, Google Trends). Altcoin-specific sentiment might differ. Factor Limitations: The chosen factors might not capture every nuance of market sentiment, and their weighting is determined by the index provider. Surveys Paused: The temporary absence of the survey component means a piece of direct investor feedback is missing. Using the index effectively means integrating it with other forms of market analysis rather than relying on it in isolation. Historical Context and Examples Looking back, we can see how the index has behaved during different market cycles. During the depths of bear markets, the index often lingers in the ‘Extreme Fear’ zone for extended periods. Conversely, during bull market peaks, it can reside in ‘Extreme Greed’. For example, during the significant price drops in past years, the index hit single digits, reflecting widespread panic. These periods, in retrospect, often represented strong accumulation opportunities for those with a long-term view and conviction. Similarly, during the euphoric phases of bull runs, scores above 80 or 90 were common, signaling a potential top or at least a point where caution was highly warranted. The current ‘Neutral’ reading is less dramatic than these extremes but equally important. It suggests a period of re-calibration after recent price action and a potential pause before the market decides its next major move. It highlights that while the extreme fear or greed has subsided, a clear directional consensus has not yet formed in the Bitcoin market and beyond. Conclusion: A Moment of Equilibrium The drop in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 52, placing it in the ‘Neutral’ zone, is a significant crypto news update for anyone following the market. It signals a shift away from the recent ‘Greed’ phase towards a state of balance or indecision. While not indicating imminent danger or opportunity like the extreme zones, ‘Neutral’ is a crucial signal for investors to remain vigilant. This period calls for careful market analysis, a focus on strategy over emotion, and preparedness for potential volatility. The index serves as a valuable reminder that market sentiment is dynamic and constantly reacting to the myriad factors influencing the Bitcoin market and the broader crypto landscape. Use this neutral period wisely to assess, plan, and stay informed.

2025-06-18T09:24:32,"Best crypto presales to buy as analysts bank on BTC’s resilience","Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market declined sharply after US President Donald Trump reignited geopolitical concerns with a pointed threat directed at Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Prices of major tokens such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) hovered near key technical levels on Wednesday following a broader sell-off the previous day. The market turned risk-averse amid growing fears that the United States may become directly involved in the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. Geopolitical flashpoints like this often trigger a flight to safety. With markets entering a defensive posture, analysts warned of further downside risk for cryptocurrencies if tensions intensify. However, one early-stage project that has shown considerable resilience during such a volatile time is Bitcoin Pepe . The project’s presale saw inflows of over $300,000 after the team made a listing announcement on June 17. Analysts bank on Bitcoin’s resilience Bitcoin remains vulnerable to further declines and must hold above $102,000 to stay positioned for a potential rebound, according to analysts at Bitfinex. In a market report published Tuesday, analysts at Bitfinex said that Bitcoin, which was trading around $104,913, must maintain support in the $102,000–$103,000 zone to indicate effective absorption of selling pressure. “Some downside risk still lingers,” the analysts noted, citing continued macroeconomic uncertainty and escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. Despite the volatility, they said the current environment represents a “high-risk, high-reward opportunity” should buyer confidence return. Crypto trader Matthew Hyland echoed the sentiment in a post on X, noting “choppy price action but still in an uptrend for BTC.” Matthew Hyland @MatthewHyland_ · Follow Choppy price action but still in an uptrend for #BTC 3:08 am · 18 Jun 2025 180 Reply Copy link Read 2 replies Expectations that Bitcoin would retest its all-time high of $111,940 were upended last week after a series of Israeli airstrikes on Iran triggered risk-off moves across global markets. Still, the Bitfinex report added that even if Bitcoin trends lower, any decline is unlikely to mirror past sharp drawdowns. Bitcoin Pepe’s presale sees strong inflows Bitcoin’s resilience amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty is helping lift sentiment across the broader crypto market, rekindling speculative appetite among investors. Historically, such environments have often preceded wider market rallies—particularly in high-volatility segments like meme coins. In this risk-on backdrop, capital is once again rotating into early-stage bets, with meme tokens emerging as early beneficiaries. Among the standout names is Bitcoin Pepe, a project that blends internet meme culture with a Layer 2 infrastructure vision. Positioned as an effort to “build Solana on Bitcoin,” Bitcoin Pepe seeks to pair the base-layer security of the Bitcoin network with the scalability and speed associated with Solana. This sets it apart from meme tokens that rely purely on community hype. The team has also released some images to showcase the real work being done. Bitcoin Pepe has gained momentum during its ongoing presale, raising close to $15 million. As per the team behind the project, the BPEP token is set to list on MEXC and BitMart, a move that is expected to enhance its visibility, liquidity, and perceived legitimacy ahead of a broader market debut. A major listing announcement is expected on June 30, adding to investor anticipation. With risk appetite recovering across crypto markets, Bitcoin Pepe appears well positioned to capitalise on speculative inflows as it enters the final stretch of its presale.

2025-06-18T09:19:34,"Bitcoin Price At Risk of Falling Below $100k, Here’s Why","The post Bitcoin Price At Risk of Falling Below $100k, Here’s Why appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin’s price action has been choppy lately, with sharp drops followed by quick recoveries, leaving traders on edge. Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin continues to hold critical support around the $100,000 mark—a level that many view as the market’s last line of defense. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is down by more than 1.5% and is trading slightly above the $105k mark. On the upside, resistance sits near $109,000–$110,000, creating a narrow trading range where each bounce and pullback tests both buyers and sellers. Technical patterns point to a classic bull flag formation, hinting that once Bitcoin carves out a higher low here, it could break upward. If that happens, the next major challenge would be clearing the $109,000–$110,000 zone, after which relatively little stands in the way of a run toward $180,000–$200,000. However, the bears still have potent support levels to contend with: Fibonacci walls near $93,000 and $92,000, followed by additional floors at $85,000 and $77,000. A sustained break below these would require an extraordinary “black swan” event to shift sentiment decisively bearish. Outside of pure crypto factors, wider market moves are playing a role. A looming inverse head-and-shoulders pattern in U.S. stocks could spark a 5–10% drop there, which in turn might spill over into digital assets. For now, traders are in “protection mode,” wary of taking fresh altcoin positions until Bitcoin’s trend becomes clearer. Yet history shows these rocky phases often mark market bottoms, setting the stage for the next leg up once confidence returns. In short, Bitcoin is at a pivotal moment: hold above $100,000 and the path to new highs remains open; slip below the key support walls and deeper pullbacks become more likely.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-price-at-risk-of-falling-below-100k-heres-why/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis",cryptocompare

In a new interview on the Schwab Network, Novogratz says Bitcoin will eventually increase 850% from its current value due to increased adoption and a weakening US dollar. “The price moves on two metrics. One is adoption, more and more people being introduced to it. We call it orange pilling them. Somebody orange pilled Larry Fink, that was a big deal, because now he got all BlackRock engaged. In Invesco, our partners engaged, and more and more financial institutions are engaged. The other is the macro backdrop, which I think continues to be government spending too much money.” He also believes that younger generations will prefer investing in the top crypto asset over gold, which would send Bitcoin higher. “And so how do I think Bitcoin can go to a million? Well, gold is roughly a $20 trillion asset, and Bitcoin is roughly a $2 trillion asset. We had Warren Buffett retire. Charlie Munger passed away. They didn’t like Bitcoin. They’re not Bitcoin people, but I bet you their grandkids are right. Kids like digital stuff. And as we have this wealth transfer from baby boomers, who are all, rest their souls, going to slowly pass away and that money gets passed down, they’re going to be more willing to buy Bitcoin than gold.” Novogratz previously said Bitcoin has become an “institutionalized macro asset” just like gold or silver. Bitcoin is trading for $105,270 at time of writing, down 2.3% in the last 24 hours.

2025-06-18T09:14:58,"Washington’s Spokane City Bans Bitcoin ATMs, 11,000 Scam Complaints Received in 2024","The city of Spokane in the US state of Washington has banned crypto kiosks within city limits. The Spokane City Council has directed existing crypto ATM operators to remove dozens of machines found in convenience stores and gas stations. The Council, on Monday, voted unanimously on an ordinance that eliminates and prohibits crypto ATMs located within the Spokane city. According to a local report , the overall ban arrives as the city is seeing an uptick in scams related to Bitcoin kiosks. “This ordinance will protect vulnerable Spokane residents from scams involving virtual currency kiosks, and I am proud we are the first city in the state to move this legislation forward,” said Council Member Paul Dillon, who presented the ordinance. Per Coin ATM Radar data , there are nearly 45 Bitcoin kiosks in and around Spokane. Some of the well-known Bitcoin ATM operators in the city include Coinflip and Bitcoin Deposit. Scammers Disguised as Revenue Personnel Target Spokane Residents Police detective Tim Schwering initially raised the issue of increasing crypto ATM fraud cases. “I’ve had a number of cases where this money that’s placed in there will end up in places like China, North Korea, Russia,” Schwering told the Council . “What is happening is people are getting scammed.” Further, scammers pose as representatives from the Internal Revenue Service and ask users to buy crypto from kiosks to protect their money. In some cases, they even threaten victims, particularly senior citizens, to either follow their instructions or face jail term. Schwering applauded the Council’s decision to ban all crypto kiosks in Spokane. “This is a vital first step in protecting Spokane residents,” he said. Nearly 11K Crypto ATM Scam Complaints Received in 2024: FBI According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) estimates, there were nearly $5.6 billion in losses due to crypto ATM scams in the US. The losses amounted to over $141 million in Washington alone. The FBI 2024 report said that the agency received 10,956 complaints, amounting to $246.7 million in losses. The report added that complaints from residents increased by 99% from 2023. Source: FBI Scammers particularly target victims above 60. The FBI recorded $107 million in losses in this age category alone in over 8,000 cases. “There were cases I was confident I knew the name and bank account, but he was sitting in mainland China, and there was nothing I could do about it,” Schwering told early this month to the Spokane Council. Other cities like Stillwater, Minnesota have barred crypto ATMs in April and more cities in that state are considering similar regulations.

Accordingly, Spain's second largest bank, BBVA, recommended its clients to invest up to 7% in cryptocurrencies. Philippe Meyer, Head of Digital and Blockchain Solutions at BBVA Switzerland, said that since September 2024, they have been advising their high-net-worth clients to allocate up to 7% of their portfolio to cryptocurrencies. The bank recommends a crypto allocation between 3% and 7%, depending on the client’s risk appetite. Meyer said that BBVA currently recommends its clients to invest mainly in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), but they will expand the scope of crypto advice to other altcoins later this year. “We started advising on Bitcoin and Ethereum with private clients since September last year. We allow clients to invest up to 7% of their portfolio in crypto, depending on risk appetite. As such, we believe BBVA is one of the first major global banks to advise its clients to purchase cryptocurrencies. Because we have been fulfilling customers' requests to purchase cryptocurrencies since 2021.” *This is not investment advice.
