2025-06-18T17:52:14,"Interview | HIVE CFO: Hydro-cooled mining and AI cloud give us an edge post-halving","As Bitcoin mining enters a new chapter post-halving, HIVE Digital Technologies is taking a measured, ambitious approach to growth. In this interview, Darcy Daubaras, CFO of HIVE, offers an inside look at how the company plans to scale its hashrate to 25 EH/s by the end of 2025 while sticking to its no-debt philosophy and keeping a close eye on operational discipline. Daubaras explains how HIVE is balancing speed with sustainability. It is interesting to note that HIVE’s story isn’t just about mining . The company has also made an early move into AI and high-performance cloud services, using its green data centers to diversify beyond crypto and build long-term resilience. Daubaras explains how this dual focus between Bitcoin ( BTC ) and computing gives HIVE a competitive edge, especially as ESG concerns and energy costs dictate the winners and losers in the mining industry. For investors and industry watchers, it’s a rare glimpse into how one of the sector’s most forward-thinking firms is positioning itself for the future. Below is the complete Q&A with Darcy Daubaras. crypto.news: HIVE is undertaking a massive hashrate expansion with the goal of 25 EH/s by late 2025. You already hit 10 EH/s as of May. Your goal still represents a further increase of around 2.5x in capacity. What are the biggest execution risks in scaling up this rapidly, and how are you managing these challenges to ensure you meet your 25 EH/s goal on time? DD: Scaling to 25 EH/s is an ambitious objective, but we are firmly on track. However, rapid expansion at this scale naturally introduces execution risks, including global supply chain volatility, hardware logistics, and tight construction timelines. We actively manage these risks through a combination of disciplined project planning, phased deployments, and strong local execution. Our partnerships with trusted vendors and our local presence at each site provide us with critical visibility and control at every stage of the buildout. In Paraguay, for instance, our operations are led by Country President Gabriel Lamas, a seasoned electrical engineer with over two decades of experience in large-scale infrastructure and energy projects throughout Latin America. Under his guidance, we are constructing high-performance, hydro-powered data centres designed for long-term reliability, grid efficiency, and sustainability. His deep understanding of energy systems ensures that as we scale in South America, we are not just growing quickly, but with precision and resilience. CN: Are there any financing challenges to scaling your operation, considering your ‘no debt’ stance? Will you deploy more of your Bitcoin treasury or raise capital if needed, or can HIVE continue working towards its goals through operational cash flow? Speaking of which, how do you decide when to hold mined BTC versus when to liquidate or use it for corporate needs? DD: Using Bitcoin from our treasury to fund growth gives us flexibility without incurring debt; however, it requires disciplined timing and robust treasury management. Given Bitcoin’s historical volatility, we are cautious to structure transactions that provide downside protection and potential buybacks. We only deploy BTC when it presents clear, accretive growth. Our goal is always to safeguard long-term upside while responsibly funding accretive expansion. CN: HIVE has aggressively invested in next-gen mining hardware, such as the S21+ Hydro ASICs for your fleet. I’m not going to pretend to understand what is happening ‘under the hood’, but perhaps you can explain how these state-of-the-art, hydro-cooled machines give HIVE an edge over competitors in terms of performance or unit economics? Are these tools sufficient for your needs out of the box or do you need to explore further in-house optimization to improve efficiency and hash rate density? DD: The S21+ Hydro ASICs represent a major leap forward in mining efficiency, and we’ve made a deliberate bet on this technology as a cornerstone of our next growth phase. Hydro-cooled ASIC miners are environmentally responsible due to their superior energy efficiency and reduced environmental impact. Liquid cooling requires less energy than traditional air systems, lowering total site power consumption and improving power usage effectiveness.. These systems also eliminate high-speed fans, cutting noise pollution and making them more suitable for community integration. The stable thermal environment extends equipment life, reducing electronic waste. Additionally, hydro-cooled setups are often paired with renewable energy sources like hydropower, further minimizing carbon footprint. Together, these factors make hydro-cooled miners a more sustainable choice for responsible Bitcoin mining operations. At HIVE, we see hardware as just one part of the equation. It’s how you deploy, tune, and manage that hardware, especially at scale, that really sets leaders apart. As such, we’ve developed proprietary firmware optimizations that fine-tune voltage and frequency settings to push performance beyond factory specifications while maintaining energy efficiency. CN: HIVE reported an approximate 35% gross operating margin in fiscal 2024. However, since the 2024 halving, industry economics have obviously tightened while network difficulty is at an all-time high. With that said, what margin profile do you expect for HIVE in the coming quarters or full fiscal year? DD: Sustainability throughout all market cycles is a core aspect of our strategy. At a Bitcoin price of $120K, our gross mining margin is roughly 65%, with a breakeven hash price close to $20. Nevertheless, we operate with one of the most streamlined teams in the industry, maintain the lowest G&A expenses among our peers, and are highly disciplined in our capital allocation. This efficiency keeps our cost structure competitive, enabling us to stay profitable even if Bitcoin falls below $100K. CN: How does your diversification into GPU cloud services or AI computing complement your core Bitcoin mining business, or is this just a natural expansion? Do you envision HIVE’s green data centers eventually servicing a larger share of AI, machine learning, or other cloud workloads as a hedge against crypto cycles, and can this become a significant revenue stream or competitive advantage for HIVE in the long run? DD: Our entry into HPC and AI cloud services isn’t a pivot. In fact, HIVE was the first Bitcoin miner to launch an AI strategy, seizing the opportunity right after Ethereum transitioned to proof-of-stake. We repurposed our GPU infrastructure early and deliberately, offering high-performance, sovereign AI compute to enterprises, research institutions, and other mission-critical users. That foresight is paying off as BUZZ HPC is already reaching revenue milestones ahead of schedule. As AI and data centre infrastructure increasingly become national security priorities, we see enormous tailwinds driving demand for trusted, green compute. This is also smart risk management. When crypto markets soften, AI compute demand remains robust. Over time, we expect our green data centres to power both the blockchain and AI economies. That dual engine gives HIVE a sustainable competitive advantage and a pathway to long-term, diversified revenue growth. CN: How are you preparing for potential downturns or unexpected shocks in the Bitcoin market? Do you utilize any hedging strategies to protect against price swings, or is HIVE essentially fully exposed to Bitcoin with confidence that low costs and a strong balance sheet will carry you through any bear market? Or, do you just HODL and hope for the best? DD: Our belief in the long-term value of the Bitcoin network is central to our strategy. However, we manage risk through structural advantages such as minimal debt, low operating costs, and flexible treasury management. Our fleet is designed to endure downturns with discipline. We may monetize BTC when it facilitates accretive growth, but we’re not forced sellers. Our philosophy is straightforward: strong balance sheet, efficient operations, and long-term conviction. CN: The Bitcoin mining sector as a whole is under increasing ESG scrutiny from regulators, environmental groups, and even investors concerned about energy consumption and carbon emissions. We’ve seen some jurisdictions consider moratoriums or bans on mining (Paraguay’s debate being one example), and miners are now keen to prove their climate credentials. In your view, is the industry doing enough to address these concerns? How is HIVE contributing to improving the narrative around Bitcoin mining’s environmental impact? DD: The ESG debate in mining is valid, but it often lacks nuance. HIVE has always been a renewable-first miner. Since our inception, we’ve prioritized green energy in Iceland, Sweden, Canada, and now Paraguay. We believe the industry must lead with transparency, accurate emissions data, and proactive grid integration. We’re also working to shift the narrative: Bitcoin mining can provide a net benefit to energy systems by stabilizing grids, monetizing stranded power, and supporting local communities. At HIVE, we support that claim with action and investment. CN: Do you anticipate a shakeout ahead, where higher-cost or over-leveraged miners struggle and network growth slows? How does a company like HIVE position itself in this scenario? Are you preparing to capture market share from potential drop-outs, or even to acquire assets/equipment from distressed miners? DD: A shakeout is not only likely, but also healthy. The post-halving landscape has separated efficient operators from the rest, and HIVE is uniquely positioned to benefit. We run lean, avoid leverage, and operate at scale using renewable power. If distressed assets enter the market, we’ll be opportunistic, but only if they meet our stringent ROI and ESG criteria. This is a cycle where resilience prevails, and that’s where we’ve focused our strategy. CN: How does HIVE approach site selection and energy procurement? With your large Paraguay hydro projects, it seems you’ve locked in relatively low-cost, renewable power. Are you looking at other geographies with cheap power for future expansion, or do you feel your current mix already provides a competitive enough energy cost profile? DD: Energy is crucial in mining, and we’re precise in how we assess jurisdictions. We seek low-cost renewable energy, regulatory stability, and grid reliability. Paraguay meets all these criteria and more, which is why it’s now a key part of our global fleet. However, we’re not pausing here. We’re actively investigating further opportunities, as diversification aids us in mitigating geopolitical and operational risks while securing low-cost energy for the long term. CN: Curious as a follow-up from the previous question, if Paraguay is such an ideal location for your operation, why not base 100% of your operation there? What exactly is the benefit of geographical diversification? DD: Paraguay is politically stable and offers abundant hydropower, which is why we chose to invest there. However, like any jurisdiction, risks exist. These include regulatory changes, limitations in grid infrastructure, and regional trade dynamics. We have built strong relationships with the government and work closely with local utilities to ensure alignment. By investing in grid upgrades and developing local talent, we are helping to build long-term resilience into our operations. Nonetheless, our goal is global resilience; while Paraguay is our flagship, our operational playbook remains multi-site and multi-country. CN: Some investors see (Micro)Strategy primarily as a proxy for Bitcoin exposure rather than a software company. Given that HIVE also holds BTC on its balance sheet and now runs data centers and HPC operations, how do you want investors to view HIVE? Are you basically one part miner, one part digital asset infrastructure play, or a de facto Bitcoin ETF? Do you feel the need to market yourself as a more balanced alternative to Strategy’s ‘infinite money glitch’ reputation? DD: HIVE is a new breed of Bitcoin infrastructure company. Long before the latest wave of corporate Bitcoin adopters, HIVE became the first public company to hold BTC on its balance sheet. In many respects, we helped define the Bitcoin treasury model. However, we’re not merely a hashrate story or a BTC proxy. We’re building renewable-powered digital infrastructure with two distinct, complementary monetization layers: Bitcoin mining and high-performance computing. Consider us as a green data centre business operating at the intersection of blockchain and AI. Unlike companies focusing on short-term quarters, HIVE is dedicated to building sustainable infrastructure for decades to come. We’re creating long-term financial and digital sovereignty while providing investors with diversified exposure to both decentralized networks and the compute layer powering the next generation of innovation. CN: Do you think there’s any room for strategic collaboration (or outright acquisitions) between mining firms and treasury-heavy companies like Strategy? Have you been approached by Strategy for any discussions? Or are you too fundamentally different on opposite sides of the Bitcoin ecosystem to create any synergies? DD: We respect what Strategy has built as a treasury-focused BTC vehicle, but our models are fundamentally different. As a traditional Bitcoin miner, we differ from Strategy in that we generate Bitcoin by securing the network through high-performance computing infrastructure. Our business model relies on operational efficiency and energy strategy. In contrast, Strategy is a software company that holds Bitcoin as a treasury asset. They gain exposure through purchases, not production. While both models benefit from Bitcoin appreciation, miners actively contribute to the ecosystem, whereas Strategy is primarily a strategic investor.. While we haven’t had direct discussions with them to date, we’re always open to exploring strategic partnerships if they create value for shareholders and align with our ethos of operational discipline.",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/interview-hive-cfo-hydro-cooled-mining-and-ai-cloud-give-us-an-edge-post-halving/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION","Interviews|Bitcoin|Mining",cryptocompare

2025-06-18T17:50:11,"Iran US Tension: Khamenei Issues Unyielding Warning on War and Peace","BitcoinWorld Iran US Tension: Khamenei Issues Unyielding Warning on War and Peace Geopolitical tremors can send significant waves through global financial markets, and the world of cryptocurrency is certainly not immune. When major players on the international stage issue strong statements, investors everywhere pay attention. The latest development comes from Iran, where Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has delivered a potent message regarding the country’s stance on its relationship with the United States. This statement, reported by Walter Bloomberg on X, underscores the ongoing Iran US tension and adds another layer to the complex global security landscape. Understanding the Latest Iran US Tension The core of the recent news is a direct and unequivocal declaration from Iran’s highest authority. According to reports, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei stated clearly that Iran will not accept an imposed peace or war. This isn’t just diplomatic rhetoric; it signals a firm position against external pressure, whether it’s forcing a resolution or instigating conflict. Furthermore, he issued a stark warning: any attack by the United States will face serious and irreversible consequences. This Khamenei statement is a significant indicator of the current state of relations between the two nations, which have been strained for decades, marked by periods of heightened tension and proxy conflicts in the Middle East. Understanding the context is key. The relationship between Iran and the United States involves a multitude of complex issues, including Iran’s nuclear program, sanctions, regional influence, and maritime security. Statements like this often come during periods where diplomatic efforts are stalled or perceived threats are high. Khamenei’s remarks can be interpreted as a deterrent message, aiming to dissuade potential military action or coercive diplomatic tactics by highlighting the potential costs. How Khamenei’s Statement Amplifies Geopolitical Risk Anytime a major regional power like Iran issues such a strong warning directed at a global superpower like the United States, it immediately heightens geopolitical risk . Geopolitical risk refers to the possibility that political events will affect a market. This can include wars, terrorist attacks, or even just increased political instability and diplomatic friction between nations. Khamenei’s declaration that Iran will not accept an ‘imposed peace or war’ suggests a refusal to be dictated to, implying that any external attempt to force a specific outcome could be met with resistance. The mention of ‘serious and irreversible consequences’ in response to a US attack is particularly significant. This vague but menacing phrase leaves room for interpretation, potentially encompassing a range of retaliatory actions, from cyberattacks to targeting shipping lanes, proxy forces, or even direct military engagement. Such uncertainty is precisely what drives up geopolitical risk premiums in markets. Investors dislike uncertainty, and the prospect of escalation in a volatile region like the Middle East is a major source of concern. Key aspects of amplified geopolitical risk: Increased Uncertainty: The lack of clarity on what ‘serious and irreversible consequences’ entails creates significant market unease. Potential for Disruption: Conflict in the Middle East can disrupt oil supplies, shipping routes, and regional stability, impacting global trade and economies. Policy Reactions: Governments may impose new sanctions or take other defensive/offensive measures, further altering the economic and political landscape. Investor Sentiment: Fear and risk aversion can lead to capital flight from riskier assets to perceived safe havens. Potential Crypto Market Impact of Middle East Conflict So, what does heightened Middle East conflict potential mean for the dynamic world of cryptocurrency? The connection might not be immediately obvious to everyone, but geopolitical events have shown a tangible impact on crypto markets, particularly Bitcoin (BTC). Here’s how the increased geopolitical risk stemming from the Iran US tension could affect the crypto market: 1. Bitcoin as a ‘Safe Haven’ Narrative: During times of traditional market uncertainty and geopolitical instability, Bitcoin has sometimes been framed as a digital ‘safe haven’ asset, similar to gold. The argument is that because it is decentralized, not controlled by any single government, and operates on a global network, it might be seen as a store of value when national currencies or traditional banking systems seem vulnerable. When tensions rise, some investors might move a portion of their wealth into Bitcoin, potentially increasing demand and price. However, this narrative is still debated, and Bitcoin’s volatility means it doesn’t always act as a reliable safe haven. 2. Increased Volatility: Crypto markets are known for their volatility, and major global events tend to amplify this. News of potential conflict or escalating tensions can lead to sharp price swings as traders react to the headlines. This presents both opportunities and significant risks for investors. 3. Capital Flows: If regional instability leads to capital controls or economic uncertainty in affected areas, there might be increased interest in cryptocurrencies as a way to move or preserve wealth outside traditional systems. This was observed, for example, in countries experiencing hyperinflation or political turmoil. 4. Impact on Global Liquidity: Major geopolitical events can influence global liquidity and investor risk appetite. If traditional markets face significant sell-offs due to fear, this can sometimes spill over into crypto, as investors might sell any liquid asset to cover losses or reduce overall exposure to risk. It’s important to note that the crypto market is influenced by many factors, and geopolitical events are just one piece of the puzzle. However, a significant escalation in the Middle East could certainly become a dominant factor in market movements for a period. Navigating Uncertainty: Actionable Insights for the Crypto Investor Given the potential for heightened geopolitical risk and its possible impact on the crypto market impact , what steps can investors take? While no one can predict market movements with certainty, here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch not only on crypto news but also on major global geopolitical developments, particularly those involving the Iran US tension and the broader Middle East conflict situation. Reliable news sources (like the one reporting the Khamenei statement ) are crucial. Evaluate Your Risk Tolerance: Understand that periods of high geopolitical risk often mean increased market volatility. Ensure your investment portfolio aligns with your comfort level regarding potential price swings. Consider Diversification: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversifying across different cryptocurrencies, and potentially across different asset classes, can help mitigate risk. Think Long-Term: Trying to time the market based on unpredictable geopolitical events is extremely difficult. For many investors, focusing on their long-term investment strategy is often more prudent than reacting impulsively to short-term news. Secure Your Assets: In times of global uncertainty, the security of your digital assets is paramount. Ensure you are using strong passwords, two-factor authentication, and consider hardware wallets for significant holdings. Avoid Leverage if Unsure: Trading with leverage during volatile periods amplified by geopolitical risk can lead to rapid and substantial losses. This is not financial advice, but rather general guidance on approaching markets during uncertain times. The key is to be prepared, informed, and measured in your approach. Conclusion: Watching the Horizon Supreme Leader Khamenei’s firm declaration that Iran will not accept an imposed peace or war, coupled with the warning of serious consequences for any US attack, is a significant statement that highlights the enduring Iran US tension . This adds a layer of complexity to the global geopolitical landscape and undeniably increases geopolitical risk , particularly concerning potential Middle East conflict . While the direct link between these political statements and the crypto market impact might seem indirect, history shows that major global uncertainties can influence investor behavior and market dynamics, sometimes pushing assets like Bitcoin into the spotlight as potential, albeit volatile, safe havens. The Khamenei statement serves as a reminder that external factors can play a significant role in market sentiment. As the situation develops, market participants will be closely watching for any signs of escalation or de-escalation. For those involved in cryptocurrency, staying informed about both geopolitical developments and market reactions is essential for navigating the potential volatility that such high-stakes international relations can introduce.

2025-06-18T17:40:11,"ANAP Bitcoin Purchase: Japanese Fashion Giant Accelerates Bold Crypto Strategy","BitcoinWorld ANAP Bitcoin Purchase: Japanese Fashion Giant Accelerates Bold Crypto Strategy In a move turning heads in both the fashion and finance worlds, Japanese fashion company ANAP Holdings recently announced a substantial increase in its Bitcoin (BTC) reserves. This latest acquisition signals a growing trend of companies looking to integrate digital assets into their treasury strategies, and ANAP is certainly making a bold statement. ANAP Bitcoin Purchase: What Are the Details? According to a press release issued on June 18th, ANAP Holdings completed the purchase of an additional 31.2108 Bitcoin. This acquisition came at a cost of 479.95 million yen, which translates to approximately $3.31 million USD at the time of the announcement. This isn’t ANAP’s first foray into the crypto market. With this latest buy, their total Bitcoin holdings have grown significantly. The company now holds a cumulative 184.6735 BTC. The total investment into these Bitcoin reserves stands at around 2.75 billion yen, roughly equivalent to $18.98 million USD. What’s even more intriguing is ANAP’s stated ambition. Earlier reports indicated the company’s intention to acquire a substantial amount of Bitcoin, setting a target of accumulating north of 1,000 BTC by August. This recent purchase brings them closer to that ambitious goal, demonstrating a clear commitment to their digital asset strategy. Why is a Fashion Brand Investing in Bitcoin? Exploring the Fashion Brand Bitcoin Trend You might be wondering why a company primarily known for fashion retail is diving deep into cryptocurrency. The decision by ANAP Holdings reflects a broader shift seen across various industries, where companies are exploring alternatives for their corporate treasuries beyond traditional cash reserves and low-yield investments. Several factors could be driving this Fashion brand Bitcoin adoption: Store of Value: Bitcoin is often seen as a potential hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, particularly in uncertain economic times. Companies holding large cash reserves see their purchasing power erode over time. Balance Sheet Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin can help diversify the company’s balance sheet, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Potential for Appreciation: While volatile, Bitcoin has historically shown significant long-term growth potential, offering the possibility of substantial returns on investment. Innovation and Brand Image: For a fashion brand, embracing a cutting-edge technology like Bitcoin could also align with an innovative brand image and potentially appeal to a tech-savvy customer base. ANAP’s move is a notable example of how companies outside the traditional finance or tech sectors are seriously considering and executing Fashion brand Bitcoin strategies. Japan Corporate Bitcoin: Is the Trend Picking Up Speed? ANAP Holdings operates within Japan, a country with a relatively developed regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies compared to some other nations. While not as prominent in corporate Bitcoin holdings as, say, the United States with companies like MicroStrategy, there are signs of increasing interest in Japan corporate Bitcoin adoption. Japan has long been a significant market for cryptocurrency trading and innovation. The regulatory clarity, though evolving, provides a foundation for companies to consider digital assets. ANAP’s significant purchase could potentially inspire other Japanese corporations to explore similar strategies, contributing to a broader trend of Japan corporate Bitcoin accumulation. This development aligns with a global movement towards greater Bitcoin institutional adoption . As more public and private companies allocate portions of their treasury reserves to Bitcoin, it lends further legitimacy to the asset class and can influence market dynamics. Understanding the ANAP Holdings BTC Strategy: Benefits and Risks ANAP Holdings’ decision to build a substantial ANAP Holdings BTC reserve comes with potential upsides and inherent risks. It’s important to look at both sides of the coin. Potential Benefits: Asset Growth: If Bitcoin’s value appreciates, ANAP’s balance sheet could see significant gains. Inflation Hedge: Protects the value of corporate reserves against potential inflation of the Japanese Yen. First-Mover Advantage (in Japan): Being an early, prominent corporate holder in Japan could provide a unique position. Attracting Talent/Customers: Could appeal to a younger, crypto-aware demographic. Potential Risks: Price Volatility: Bitcoin is known for dramatic price swings, which could negatively impact the company’s financial statements in the short term. Regulatory Changes: Future regulatory shifts in Japan or globally could affect the holding or trading of Bitcoin. Security Risks: Holding significant amounts of crypto requires robust security measures to prevent theft or loss. Accounting Treatment: Accounting for cryptocurrency holdings can be complex and subject to changing standards. The company is clearly betting that the long-term benefits outweigh the short-term volatility and risks associated with their ANAP Holdings BTC strategy. Broader Implications: The Rise of Bitcoin Institutional Adoption ANAP’s move is a piece of a much larger puzzle: the increasing trend of Bitcoin institutional adoption . While companies like MicroStrategy, which holds over 200,000 BTC, are often cited as pioneers, the list of corporations adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets continues to grow. This trend signifies a maturation of the Bitcoin market. It’s moving beyond just individual investors and speculative trading to become a recognized, albeit still volatile, asset class for corporate treasuries and large institutions. The motivations are often similar: seeking alternatives to low-yield cash, hedging against macroeconomic uncertainty, and recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a digital store of value. The increasing participation of institutions and corporations like ANAP can have several effects on the market, including: Potentially increasing demand and reducing circulating supply available on exchanges. Adding a layer of stability as institutional holders often have longer investment horizons than retail traders. Enhancing the credibility and mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin. What Does This Mean for Investors? For individual investors watching the market, corporate moves like ANAP’s provide interesting signals. They suggest that sophisticated financial teams within traditional companies are increasingly comfortable with Bitcoin as a legitimate asset. It doesn’t necessarily mean everyone should rush out and buy Bitcoin, but it does highlight the growing acceptance and strategic thinking around digital assets in the corporate world. It reinforces the narrative that Bitcoin is being viewed not just as a speculative gamble, but as a potential long-term treasury asset. Conclusion ANAP Holdings’ recent ANAP Bitcoin purchase is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a clear indicator of their strategic direction and belief in the future role of digital assets. By significantly increasing their Bitcoin reserves and setting an ambitious target of over 1,000 BTC, the Japanese fashion giant is positioning itself within the growing wave of Bitcoin institutional adoption . This development in Japan corporate Bitcoin strategy by a prominent Fashion brand Bitcoin holder like ANAP underscores the evolving landscape where companies from diverse sectors are exploring and implementing digital asset strategies. While risks remain due to volatility, the move highlights the potential benefits companies see in holding Bitcoin as part of a modern treasury management approach.

2025-06-18T17:30:20,"Buy Bitcoin Now? Not Yet—Analyst Says Time Holds The Key","In a post on June 17, prominent crypto strategist Astronomer (@astronomer_zero) outlined his high-conviction roadmap for Bitcoin’s next major breakout, emphasizing that timing—not just price—is the most critical factor for those still on the sidelines. Despite projecting a continuation of the broader uptrend that began at $18,000 in 2023, Astronomer warned that jumping in prematurely could blunt the risk-reward ratio of the next leg. “Planning to buy now into BTC is expected to net you a move of over 70% in a short period of time,” he wrote. “But the closer we get to those 10 weeks, confirmed with price action, the closer BTC is to breaking out.” Buy Bitcoin Now? His primary thesis: Bitcoin’s breakout will not occur before June 30, and any significant move is statistically more likely after that date. This aligns with what he calls one of the “most ancient crypto mechanics”—Bitcoin moves first, and altcoins follow. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Crash As War Tensions Mount In Middle East Astronomer’s roadmap presents a tiered accumulation strategy rooted in probabilistic support zones. “Upon statistical analysis, the expected close before going up only is around $103k,” he wrote. “Probably a good level to start getting involved. The expected level to be reached based on all prior signals (lowest wick) is $96k. Probably a good level to buy heavy if given. […] And finally, the expected lowest close is $90k. Probably a good level to allocate (almost) all your dry powder.” But beyond the price levels, Astronomer places stronger emphasis on timing: “If the price doesn’t go as deep into the $90’s—which I don’t think is very likely—I expect June to close between $95-110k and not go much lower. Then I’d buy more and more the closer we get to those 10 weeks regardless of the price. Time is more important than price.” He also pointed to structural market dynamics supporting his thesis, including a bullish spot-to-perpetual rotation: “The order books start to rotate towards green into spot, red into perps (aggressive shorts, aggressive spot buys), simply visible with the increasing spot premiums.” Adding to the signal strength is a recent weekly hash ribbon print—“one that never failed,” he noted. Related Reading: $150,000 Bitcoin Is In Play—Unless This One Macro Metric Snaps Astronomer further offered guidance for navigating altcoins, advising traders to wait for the breakout rather than attempting to catch falling knives. “Buying alts when BTC breaks out […] is smarter than trying to knife catch them. To eliminate the drawdown and reap the upside rewards.” Summarizing his plan, he said, “If I was sidelined, I’d look to buy below $103k and as much as possible as close to $90k as possible. And the closer we get to those 10 weeks, confirmed with price action, the more confident I become.” Astronomer’s final message underscores that his bullish stance hasn’t changed since the flip at $18K: “No top being in yet, until we reach at least 170k+. That is the plan.” And for those still unsure? He offers a blunt reminder: “This post is indeed on the backbone of our overall bull market masterplan. Good information if you want to make money—even if you’re sidelined, holding, or want to top up your bags.” At press time, BTC traded at $105,094.

2025-06-18T17:25:24,"Solana holding key support: breakout likely if bulls step in","Solana is sitting on a critical support level following a period of muted volatility and sideways consolidation. With multiple technical confluences now in play, the market appears primed for a decisive breakout,or breakdown. The current structure suggests that price is coiling, and the next move could mark a major directional shift. Solana ( SOL ) has shown signs of hesitation, yet the support zone continues to hold firm. This combination often precedes a volatility expansion, and Solana is approaching that inflection point. Traders should be watching closely, as the resolution of this range will offer clarity on the next trend direction. Key technical points, VWAP Support: The VWAP anchored from the cycle low is acting as dynamic support under current price action. 143 Daily Support: A high time frame level that has repeatedly held, providing strong market structure. Swing Low Structure: Price is respecting a cluster of key swing lows, forming a significant demand area SOLUSDT (4H), Source: Trading view. From a technical standpoint, Solana’s current chart positioning is notable. The anchored VWAP from the cycle low is sitting directly below current price and aligns with the 143 daily support level, creating a strong confluence zone. Additionally, multiple prior swing lows form a local demand cluster, suggesting this area has attracted buyers in the past. Despite this, price remains in no man’s land. Solana has not demonstrated impulsive follow-through in either direction. A decisive breakout above the current range highs could spark a run toward the next major resistance near the $170 region. Conversely, a failure to hold this support could trigger a liquidity sweep below, exposing the asset to a deeper pullback before any recovery attempt. You might also like: Coinbase Derivatives to adopt USDC as collateral for U.S. futures trading It’s also worth noting the lack of volume accompanying recent moves. Without meaningful participation, any breakout risks becoming a false move or weak trend extension. Traders should exercise caution and wait for confirmation through volume expansion and structural breaks before committing to directional setups. What to expect in the coming price action As long as Solana holds above this high-confluence support zone, the probability of a bounce remains slightly elevated. However, in the absence of a strong reaction or breakout, the range may persist. A breakdown below this level would shift bias to the downside, targeting lower support zones. The next few sessions are critical, stay patient and let the chart confirm the move.

2025-06-18T17:22:13,"China’s Bitcoin Miners Pivot to U.S Amid Rising Tariffs and Power Shift","The top three Chinese Bitcoin miners, Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT, are reportedly moving part of their production to the United States. This shift comes as trade tensions rise once again under President Donald Trump’s renewed tariff policies. These new tariffs push companies to rethink how and where they make and ship technology products, especially in the crypto industry. Bitcoin Miners Makes A Strategic Move to Avoid Tariffs Companies’ decisions are primarily driven by the growing costs of business across borders. By building mining rigs inside the U.S., these firms aim to avoid extra fees caused by tariffs on foreign-made tech goods. Bitmain, the largest of the three, has already started production in the U.S .,just after President Trump won the 2024 election. Canaan is not far behind. One of its executives recently confirmed that the company is testing early-stage production in the U.S. This is to see if the move is practical over time. Meanwhile, MicroBT has announced a localization plan to reduce its exposure to tariffs and maintain access to the U.S. market. Chinese Bitcoin Miners’ Firms Move May Stir U.S. Security Fears Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT produce over 90% of all Bitcoin mining machines worldwide. These machines are designed to solve complex math problems that power and keep the Bitcoin network secure. These companies ensure they stay competitive by shifting part of their operations to the U.S.. Even as global trade rules become more complex, this shift could help with costs and bring new challenges. Chinese firms operating in U.S. tech spaces may raise national security concerns. This is especially true given the past political tensions between the two countries. U.S. regulators have a history of being cautious about Chinese involvement in critical technology infrastructure. In January, two prominent U.S. lawmakers questioned the Treasury Department for details after a Chinese state-sponsored hacking group breached U.S. Treasury systems , compromising certain unclassified documents. America’s Role in Bitcoin Mining Grows The move also reflects a bigger change in where Bitcoin mining power is located. New data shows that the U.S. quickly becoming the world leader in industrial Bitcoin mining. On June 17, VanEck’s Mathew Sigel shared research showing that U.S.-listed miners make up 31.6% of the global Bitcoin hashrate. Hashrate is the computing power used to run and secure the Bitcoin network. The higher the hashrate, the more mining activity is taking place. In April 2024, the U.S. share of the hashrate was just 21%. In the last year, that number has grown by nearly 50%. In addition, reports show Bitcoin mining difficulty has slightly dropped after a record high, giving miners brief relief from rising costs and lower rewards.

2025-06-18T17:22:12,"BTC’s wild swings spark panic, analysts suggest RUVI as the next token to back","Bitcoin’s notorious price volatility often sends waves of uncertainty through even the most seasoned investors. While Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines with unpredictable price swings, the market appetite for stability, transparency, and exponential growth has turned toward promising projects like Ruvi AI (RUVI). With a 112x ROI potential, Ruvi AI is emerging as an audited, utility-driven alternative that could eclipse Bitcoin’s appeal during periods of market turbulence. Why analysts see Ruvi AI as the smarter investment Bitcoin’s value depends heavily on broader market trends, making it susceptible to unpredictable fluctuations. Ruvi AI, on the other hand, introduces a more structured growth model combined with real-world utility. It integrates blockchain technology and artificial intelligence (AI) to address real challenges in marketing, entertainment, and finance, making its token intrinsically valuable. Ruvi AI’s presale provides investors with an opportunity for strategic entry.

Security and transparency reinforce investor trust Ruvi AI sets itself apart by emphasizing security and trustworthiness. The platform is undergoing a third-party audit by CyberScope, a highly credible blockchain security provider, ensuring a robust and safe operational framework. The token’s partnership with WEEX Exchange, a global trading platform, guarantees post-presale liquidity, making trading convenient for holders right from the start. These measures instill confidence in both new and seasoned investors. Real-world utility fuels long-term growth Beyond its impressive ROI potential, Ruvi AI is also building relevance through its real-world applications: Marketing Ruvi AI leverages AI-powered analytics to improve campaign targeting, engagement, and ROI, offering game-changing tools for businesses.

2025-06-18T17:09:03,"BitVault Raises $2M from GSR, Gemini, and Auros to Launch BTC-Backed Money","Berlin, Germany, June 18th, 2025, Chainwire BitVault , a DeFi protocol aiming to redefine Bitcoin’s role in stablecoin infrastructure, has announced the close of a $2 million pre-seed round. Strategic investors include GSR, Gemini, Auros, and Keyrock, among others—joining BitVault in building what it calls the ""next era of BTC-backed money"": an institutionally-aligned alternative to fiat-pegged stablecoins. The raise supports the launch of bvUSD, BitVault’s overcollateralized stablecoin backed by Bitcoin derivatives, and sbvUSD, its yield-bearing variant powered by institutional trading strategies by GSR. BitVault will serve as a core stablecoin protocol on Katana, a new DeFi-first chain incubated by Polygon Labs and GSR prioritizing deep liquidity and user rewards, leveraging a licensed fork of Liquity V2 to enable permissioned borrowing, user-set interest rates, and automated liquidation infrastructure. “Bitcoin was built for moments of fracture. BitVault was built to make it usable,” said Michael Kisselgof, Core Contributor of BitVault and VaultCraft. “We specifically onboarded GSR, Auros, and Keyrock as strategic investors that can also execute high yielding, non-directional strategies to create demand and deep liquidity for BTC-backed money.” Stablecoins at an Inflection Point BitVault arrives amid rising demand for crypto-native stability in a fragmented global monetary environment. Unlike fiat-backed stablecoins like USDC or algorithmic options like Ethena’s USDe, bvUSD is collateralized by BTC derivatives. Only whitelisted institutional borrowers can mint bvUSD in bulk, while anyone can mint bvUSD using stablecoins—mitigating risks associated with overleveraged or anonymous borrowing. DeFi users can earn yield by staking bvUSD into sbvUSD, which leverages delta-neutral and arbitrage strategies managed by GSR, a globally recognized crypto investment firm specializing in market making, OTC trading, and options.. ""We’re seeing growing interest in BTC-backed stablecoins, especially those designed to integrate seamlessly into DeFi ecosystems,” said Alain Kunz, Director from GSR, who participated in the round. “BitVault’s approach with experience in institutional-grade yield strategies positions it well for success. We’re particularly excited about its deployment on Katana, a DeFi centric chain we helped incubate. BitVault adds to Katana’s evolving ecosystem by introducing a new layer of stablecoin utility, enabling BTC to take on a more productive role within Katana’s high-yield DeFi stack.” From Liquity to Katana BitVault is a friendly fork of Liquity V2, re-engineered for institutional use under a licensed deployment agreement with Liquity AG. The protocol blends automated, governance-free mechanisms with a permissioned borrowing layer, offering stability while retaining core DeFi primitives like direct redemption and composable yield strategies. Its upcoming VCRAFT token will govern future protocol parameters and serve as a rewards mechanism for stability providers and liquidity contributors. The launch on Katana, incubated by Polygon Labs and GSR, positions BitVault at the heart of an emerging liquidity and settlement network across the EVM chain. Initial integrations include Vault infrastructure, Morpho money markets, Sushi AMMs, and a multichain “Bits” points campaign tied to VCRAFT distribution. What’s Next BitVault is scheduled for mainnet deployment on Katana in June 2025, with broader integrations across DeFi ecosystems and centralized liquidity venues in the works. The team plans to expand its stablecoin suite to support additional BTC-based collateral assets and is actively onboarding institutional borrowers. About BitVault BitVault is a DeFi protocol that offers a crypto-native solution for money through its BTC-backed stablecoin, bvUSD, and a yield-bearing staked stablecoin, sbvUSD. The protocol is designed to provide an institutional-grade, capital-efficient stablecoin with user-set interest rates, multi-collateral backing, and enhanced liquidity mechanisms.

2025-06-18T17:01:07,"BitVault Raises $2M from GSR, Gemini, and Auros to Launch BTC-Backed Money","Berlin, Germany, June 18th, 2025, Chainwire BitVault , a DeFi protocol aiming to redefine Bitcoin’s role in stablecoin infrastructure, has announced the close of a $2 million pre-seed round. Strategic investors include GSR, Gemini, Auros, and Keyrock, among others—joining BitVault in building what it calls the “next era of BTC-backed money”: an institutionally-aligned alternative to fiat-pegged stablecoins. The raise supports the launch of bvUSD, BitVault’s overcollateralized stablecoin backed by Bitcoin derivatives, and sbvUSD, its yield-bearing variant powered by institutional trading strategies by GSR. BitVault will serve as a core stablecoin protocol on Katana, a new DeFi-first chain incubated by Polygon Labs and GSR prioritizing deep liquidity and user rewards, leveraging a licensed fork of Liquity V2 to enable permissioned borrowing, user-set interest rates, and automated liquidation infrastructure. “Bitcoin was built for moments of fracture. BitVault was built to make it usable,” said Michael Kisselgof , Core Contributor of BitVault and VaultCraft. “We specifically onboarded GSR, Auros, and Keyrock as strategic investors that can also execute high yielding, non-directional strategies to create demand and deep liquidity for BTC-backed money.” Stablecoins at an Inflection Point BitVault arrives amid rising demand for crypto-native stability in a fragmented global monetary environment. Unlike fiat-backed stablecoins like USDC or algorithmic options like Ethena’s USDe, bvUSD is collateralized by BTC derivatives. Only whitelisted institutional borrowers can mint bvUSD in bulk, while anyone can mint bvUSD using stablecoins—mitigating risks associated with overleveraged or anonymous borrowing. DeFi users can earn yield by staking bvUSD into sbvUSD, which leverages delta-neutral and arbitrage strategies managed by GSR, a globally recognized crypto investment firm specializing in market making, OTC trading, and options.. “We’re seeing growing interest in BTC-backed stablecoins, especially those designed to integrate seamlessly into DeFi ecosystems,” said Alain Kunz, Director from GSR, who participated in the round. “BitVault’s approach with experience in institutional-grade yield strategies positions it well for success. We’re particularly excited about its deployment on Katana, a DeFi centric chain we helped incubate. BitVault adds to Katana’s evolving ecosystem by introducing a new layer of stablecoin utility, enabling BTC to take on a more productive role within Katana’s high-yield DeFi stack.” From Liquity to Katana BitVault is a friendly fork of Liquity V2, re-engineered for institutional use under a licensed deployment agreement with Liquity AG. The protocol blends automated, governance-free mechanisms with a permissioned borrowing layer, offering stability while retaining core DeFi primitives like direct redemption and composable yield strategies. Its upcoming VCRAFT token will govern future protocol parameters and serve as a rewards mechanism for stability providers and liquidity contributors. The launch on Katana, incubated by Polygon Labs and GSR, positions BitVault at the heart of an emerging liquidity and settlement network across the EVM chain. Initial integrations include Vault infrastructure, Morpho money markets, Sushi AMMs, and a multichain “Bits” points campaign tied to VCRAFT distribution. What’s Next BitVault is scheduled for mainnet deployment on Katana in June 2025, with broader integrations across DeFi ecosystems and centralized liquidity venues in the works. The team plans to expand its stablecoin suite to support additional BTC-based collateral assets and is actively onboarding institutional borrowers. About BitVault BitVault is a DeFi protocol that offers a crypto-native solution for money through its BTC-backed stablecoin, bvUSD, and a yield-bearing staked stablecoin, sbvUSD. The protocol is designed to provide an institutional-grade, capital-efficient stablecoin with user-set interest rates, multi-collateral backing, and enhanced liquidity mechanisms.

2025-06-18T16:56:37,"Gambling with bitcoins: what is a live casino?","BitcoinWorld Gambling with bitcoins: what is a live casino? A live casino with bitcoins is a new and exciting way to enjoy gambling from the comfort of your own home. It’s pretty cool, isn’t it? In such casinos, you can not only feel the atmosphere of a real establishment, but also bet using cryptocurrency. Las Atlantis bitcoin live casino is no longer a fantasy, but a reality! The platform provides access to games with live dealers, where everything happens in real time, and at the same time you can use bitcoins for betting. The main advantage of this format is convenience. Payments with bitcoins are fast and secure. You don’t have to worry about long transfers and commissions, as in the case of traditional currencies. And the process of playing with live dealers becomes much brighter when you see the cards being dealt right in front of you, instead of waiting for the machine to process them. It’s like being at the center of the action, just on the screen. Gambling and bitcoins are a combination that opens up new possibilities. At a casino with bitcoins, you can not only bet, but also withdraw your winnings quickly and hassle-free. And when it’s all backed by real people, the game becomes much livelier. So if you want to try your luck and enjoy the real gameplay, a live bitcoin casino is the way to go. Why choose a bitcoin casino? Using bitcoins for betting is not just a fashion trend, but a practical and convenient solution. Firstly, cryptocurrency greatly simplifies financial transactions. Payments are instant and commissions are minimal. No bank transfers and long waits. Bitcoin is a direct way to fast and convenient transactions, which in turn makes the gaming process much more pleasant. In addition, bitcoins give you more freedom. You can play casino games with bitcoins from almost anywhere in the world. Blockchain allows transactions without intermediaries, which means that you can avoid the restrictions that are often imposed by traditional banks or payment systems. This is especially important for those who want to play casino games without worrying about banking restrictions. And of course, bitcoin as a cryptocurrency provides users with a high level of security. Every transaction is recorded on the blockchain, making it transparent and safe from hacking. In traditional casinos, there is always a chance that the transaction information will fall into the wrong hands. In the case of bitcoins, you don’t have to worry about the security of your data, and this is a significant advantage. Live bitcoin games: how does it work? Live casino games with bitcoins are no different from standard games with live dealers. The only difference is that you use cryptocurrency instead of traditional currencies. For example, if you play roulette, blackjack or baccarat, everything will happen the same way as in a regular casino: the dealer deals the cards, spins the roulette or conducts the game. The only difference is that you pay for your bets with bitcoins. This format of playing with bitcoins has a lot of advantages. It not only allows you to enjoy the real game, but also to conduct transactions with minimal fees. Payments are fast and no one interferes with the process. All bets and winnings are recorded in the blockchain, which gives you confidence in the integrity of the game. You see everything in real time and can follow the croupier’s every move. Live casino for bitcoins also allows you to play with real people. And that’s a huge plus! Instead of playing with machines, you interact with live dealers who are ready to comment on the game or make jokes. This adds even more atmosphere to the process. And most importantly, everything happens in real time, with no delays like in a classic casino. Games with bitcoins: what to choose? There is a wide range of games available at live casinos with bitcoins. If you like classic card games, blackjack or baccarat will definitely suit you. In blackjack, the goal is to score 21 points or get close to that number without exceeding it. A simple but fun game that requires a bit of strategy. And if you want something more dynamic, you can try poker with a live dealer. For many players, poker is not just a game, but a real art, where not only luck is important, but also the ability to read your opponents. Roulette is another classic choice. European, French or American – any version of roulette for bitcoins will be exciting. Like other games, you’ll have to place bets and hope the ball stops on the right number or color. But how exciting it is to watch the wheel spin and wait for the result! If you want something unusual, you can try sic-bo, monopoly or other non-standard games that are often found in live cryptocurrency casinos. Each of these games has its own peculiarities and brings a special excitement. And, of course, we should not forget that bets in such games can be made with bitcoins, which adds another facet to the gameplay. Tips for beginners: how to start playing? If you are just starting to play live casino for bitcoins, the main thing is to take your time. Of course, excitement can be strong, and you want to bet a large amount at once. But it is best to start with small bets to get used to the process. Watch a few rounds and observe how the dealers work is always useful. This will give you time to get used to the interface and understand how transactions work. The second tip is to choose tables with minimal stakes. This will give you a chance to learn the rules of the game without risking a lot of money. Gradually, when you feel more confident, you can increase the stakes. This way you will get all the benefits of playing with a live dealer without worrying about spending too much. Don’t forget to communicate with the dealer and other players. In chat rooms you can ask questions and discuss the game. This is not only useful, but also pleasant, because all players communicate with each other, creating the atmosphere of a real casino. Why try a live casino for bitcoins? Live casino with bitcoins is convenience, security and excitement in one flacon. Fast transactions, minimal fees and the ability to chat with real people create a unique experience. And it doesn’t matter where you are – all you need is an internet connection, and there you are at the center of the action. Even if it’s morning and you’re sitting in your pajamas with a cup of coffee, the excitement doesn’t disappear, because a real game with live dealers doesn’t require special attire or a strict dress code. Playing with bitcoins adds to the freedom. You are not tied to banks, do not worry about currency restrictions and do not waste time on currency exchange. All it takes is a few clicks and a small balance in cryptocurrency. And don’t forget that for many people this is also a way to try out new technologies, because cryptocurrency is rapidly developing and its popularity continues to grow. So if you want to try something new, with live dealers and bitcoins, you should give this casino a chance. With each new round, the excitement will grow, and the pleasure of playing with real people in real time will only increase.

2025-06-18T16:55:54,"Accountant Nearly Pulls Off $19,000,000 Bank Fraud Scam After Tricking Lenders With Forged Documents and Fake Rent Rolls: DOJ","A certified public accountant is pleading guilty to defrauding banks by giving false information in order to obtain loans, according to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). The DOJ says Christine Gendron was a financial manager at real estate firm JLL Realty Developers, where her sister, Jeanette Norman, and brother-in-law, Masaschi, were partners. According to the DOJ, Gendron entered into a conspiracy with her brother-in-law and, allegedly, her sister to defraud financial institutions. “Specifically, Masaschi, Gendron, and allegedly Norman, provided materially false, fictitious and fraudulent financial information, including false rent rolls and forged lease agreements, to obtain loans for their companies.” Gendron’s brother-in-law and, allegedly, her sister were partners in several other limited liability companies, which mostly owned commercial and residential properties in, among other places, Connecticut and Western Massachusetts. The DOJ says that after obtaining the loans, Gendron’s brother-in-law and, allegedly, her sister, as well as their firms, only partially repaid the loans or didn’t pay at all. This resulted in financial institutions incurring substantial losses of over $19 million, per the Justice Department. Gendron could now spend decades in prison once convicted of her criminal charges. “The charge of conspiracy to commit bank fraud provides for a sentence of up to 30 years in prison, five years of supervised release and a fine of up to $1 million or twice the gross gain or loss.” Gendron’s sister, who has pleaded not guilty, is scheduled to stand trial in October.

2025-06-18T16:51:36,"Cardano Price Prediction: Hoskinson’s Bitcoin Fund Could Trigger Long-Awaited ADA Breakout","Cardano may be on the brink of a major DeFi transformation, with founder Charles Hoskinson proposing a $100 million sovereign wealth fund to supercharge the network’s ecosystem, an idea that could add weight to bullish long-term Cardano price forecasts . The proposal would see 5% to 10% of the protocol’s treasury diversified into assets like Bitcoin and “yield-bearing instruments” like USDM—Cardano’s native stablecoin . The stablecoin strategy centers around a self-reinforcing feedback loop: earn passive income by providing liquidity through staking, then use that income to buy back ADA and refill the treasury. A Sovereign Wealth Fund Could Challenge Ethereum and Solana Hoskinson estimates the strategy —if annualised—could grow the Cardano stablecoin treasury to $1 billion within 5-10 years, creating a more stable floor to encourage DeFi activity. Cardano Founder Proposes Deploying $100M of $ADA Treasury to Boost #Cardano DeFi and Reinvest in $ADA . pic.twitter.com/JSNAIIYfkv — Altcoin Daily (@AltcoinDaily) June 12, 2025 He noted that Ethereum and Solana are ahead in terms of stablecoin-to-TVL ratios, which enables them to lead in DeFi. With this strategy, Cardano could close the gap. The inclusion of Bitcoin would serve as a hedge against the inflationary risks of fiat-pegged stablecoins, adding a defensive layer to the fund’s composition. However, community governance stands in the way of its implementation, and not everyone is on board. While Hoskinson maintains that the conversion is unlikely to negatively impact the ADA price, community members do not support 9-figure sell pressure in an already fragile market. “If you hope to sell 140m at $0.7 next month, the market will ensure you sell it for $0.5,” commentator Cardano Whale added on X . Cardano Price Analysis: Could the Fund Push a Breakout? While the Cardano community governance process could delay implementation, a buy-the-rumor response from the market could fuel the breakout of the huge 7-month falling wedge pattern. After several failed attempts breakout, the last rejection has set the Cardano price on the path to retest its lower boundary. ADA / USDT 3-day chart, falling wedge pattern. Source: TradingView, Binance. It currently holds the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level as interim support at $0.60—a level which typically coincides with local bottoms in a shallow retracement. $0.60 has also acted as a significant demand zone since late 2024, but momentum indicators now cast doubt over its strength. The RSI reversed sharply after being rejected at the neutral 50 mark. This reflects fading bullish strength, especially after bears failed to capitalize on recent seller exhaustion. More so, the MACD confirms early signs of sustained downside, having widened its gap below the signal line after a death cross to start June. If ADA loses the $0.60 level, it could delay a breakout, ruling out the current $1 technical target based on the 1.618 Fib extension—an 80% gain from current prices. This bearish case could see the Cardano price fall 14% to the $0.50 support that marked the mid-April market bottom. Looking further ahead, the July 15 Cardano ETF decision could be the next solid fundamental catalyst ADA needs to renew momentum, increasing demand in traditional investment markets. Traders Could Maximise Their Gains Potential With This Simple Tool When it comes to large coins like Cardano, timing is everything. It takes months for breakouts to build, and as short as a week for them to unfold—holders spend most of their time waiting. Meanwhile, newer coins making the rounds like Aura are posting 46x gains in a single day. That’s where Snorter ($SNORT) steps in. Its purpose-built trading bot is engineered to spot early momentum, helping investors get in before the crowd—where the real gains are made.

2025-06-18T16:40:35,"Bitcoin rangebound as Iran-Israel tensions persist, AERO leads altcoins with 10% rally","Bitcoin traded in a narrow range between $103,630 and $105,532 on Tuesday amid escalating tensions in the Middle East. Risk appetite faded across the board, dragging the total crypto market cap down by nearly 2% to $3.35 trillion. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index fell 5 points to 48, sliding toward the lower end of the neutral zone. The downturn was more pronounced in the altcoin market, with most major tokens trading lower during late Asian hours on Wednesday. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bitcoin’s pullback reflects growing investor unease as geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties intensify. The ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran has been a key driver of market sentiment in recent sessions. Traders have reacted sharply to signs of escalation, with fears of direct military involvement by the United States weighing heavily on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Sentiment took another hit after former President Donald Trump, speaking on the White House lawn, confirmed Iran had reached out to the U.S. for dialogue but warned it might be “very late” for a peaceful resolution. Bitcoin briefly rebounded to $105,000 following those comments, but the broader market remained on edge due to the lack of concrete diplomatic progress. Meanwhile, macroeconomic concerns continue to dampen enthusiasm. Investors are bracing for the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision later on June 18, with expectations of a hawkish hold. According to QCP Capital, the Fed is likely to acknowledge renewed inflationary pressures stemming from geopolitical instability, trade tariffs, and surging oil prices. A reduction in the Fed’s projected number of rate cuts for 2025 could further pressure Bitcoin and other digital assets, as markets recalibrate expectations around liquidity. While recent U.S. unemployment data was in line with forecasts, offering brief relief, it did little to offset broader concerns about the inflation outlook. Adding to the caution, Trump renewed his criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell and called for immediate rate cuts, despite prevailing market expectations that such policy easing will not materialise before Q3. Traders are increasingly wary of heightened volatility around central bank messaging, especially as crypto markets remain highly sensitive to shifts in global risk sentiment. Will Bitcoin crash again? Volatility is expected as markets navigate a highly uncertain landscape. While Bitcoin has shown resilience near the $103,000 support zone, further downside remains possible if the conflict in the Middle East escalates or if the Federal Reserve strikes a more hawkish tone than anticipated. Looking at Bitcoin’s liquidity heatmap, key bid liquidity clusters remain concentrated just above $103,000, suggesting that buyers are actively defending this level. Binance BTC/USDT 24-hour liquidation heatmap. Source: Coinglass. The visible concentration of liquidation leverage and bid depth near this range signals strong short-term support, though the presence of stacked sell-side liquidity around $106,000 continues to cap upward momentum. The market’s current positioning also reflects a build-up in short interest, with perpetual contracts skewed heavily toward defensive short setups. This raises the potential for a short squeeze if sentiment shifts suddenly on positive geopolitical headlines or dovish Fed commentary. However, until there is greater clarity, Bitcoin remains pinned within a tight range, with traders closely watching for liquidation triggers or sudden breaks through key liquidity zones. The dense clustering of orders around $104,000–$105,000 also suggests an ongoing tug-of-war between bulls and bears as uncertainty dominates market direction. Bullish narrative, though scarce today, hasn’t completely disappeared. According to Merljin the Trader, some technicals remain firmly intact, with the weekly MACD flipping green and price structure mirroring previous consolidation patterns that preceded strong rallies. BTC/USD 1-week price chart. Source: Merljin the Trader Meanwhile, fellow analyst Cas Abbé pointed to sustained strength in On-Balance Volume (OBV), highlighting that despite price consolidation, buying pressure continues to build.

As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $104,892, down 0.5% in the past 23 hours. Altcoin market overview Over the past 24 hours, the total altcoin market cap rose 3.2% to over $1.28 trillion. This came as the Altcoin Season Index reading dropped to 21, indicating Bitcoin’s performance continues to perform better than most of the top 99 altcoins. Ethereum (ETH), the largest altcoin by market cap, was trading sideways at around the $2,500 level while its market cap stood at $303 billion when writing. Other large-cap altcoins such as XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL), Tron (TRX), and Cardano (ADA) logged losses ranging between 1-3%. Aerodrome Finance (AERO) stood as the only altcoin among the top 100 leading crypto assets by market cap to hold onto double-digit gains of 15.99% while Sei (SEI) and Cronos (CRO) managed to hold onto little gains. See below: Source: CoinMarketCap Aero rallied after Coinbase integrated Base‑chain DEX functionality, including Aerodrome, into its main app, giving AERO exposure to over 10.8 million monthly users.

Sei posted slight gains as anticipation builds around Sei Giga, a forthcoming upgrade aimed at improving execution, consensus, and storage efficiency.

The cryptocurrency's response to this event could either stabilize its price or send it tumbling. Investors and traders are on edge, eager to learn which coins might thrive amid the turbulence. Stay tuned to uncover potential winners in this tense market scenario. Bitcoin Struggles to Break Key Barriers, Bears in Control Source: tradingview Bitcoin is currently facing challenges, hovering between around $102K and almost $110K. The bulls are struggling as BTC battles to break past the nearby resistance at just over $114K. In contrast, the bears seem strong with support just under $99K. If bears continue, Bitcoin could drop further, nearing $91K. However, if bulls gain momentum and push Bitcoin above the $114K mark, the next big target would be about $121K. This could mean a rise of almost 18% from the current lower range. With Bitcoin's current indicators showing weakness, the market is waiting to see if bulls can rally soon. Conclusion Bitcoin’s struggle at key resistance zones signals a fragile market sentiment heading into the FOMC decision. If bulls can’t reclaim momentum soon, a deeper correction could follow. But for sharp-eyed investors, volatility also breeds opportunity. The next few days could separate short-term panic from long-term positioning—and spotlight which assets are truly built to endure.

2025-06-18T16:35:15,"ZachXBT Flags $5-10B Black Market on Tron Linked to Lazarus Group Hacks","According to on-chain investigator ZachXBT, funds stolen in several recent crypto exchange hacks allegedly linked to North Korea’s Lazarus Group have been successfully laundered through illicit networks and small over-the-counter (OTC) brokers. In a recent post on X, ZachXBT spoke about the growing scale of crypto-related crime and estimated that the so-called “Black U” market operating on the Tron blockchain may be worth between $5 billion and $10 billion. However, much of it remains untraceable. Is Crypto “Ripe For Abuse”? He pointed to attacks on platforms such as Bybit , DMM Bitcoin, and WazirX, where stolen assets were laundered “with ease,” and added that laundering groups have “seemingly won the battle” over enforcement. The investigator further criticized protocol teams that continue to earn fees while turning a blind eye to illicit activity, and noted that over 50% of some protocols’ usage may stem from stolen funds. ZachXBT’s comments also reflect broader frustration over what he terms a “crime supercycle” – an era marked by minimal accountability. He cited a surge in abuse following the launch of meme coins by politicians and the dismissal of key court cases, which has allowed malicious actors to operate with little fear of repercussions. With influencers scamming followers and courts siding with smart contract exploiters, he warns that without meaningful enforcement or public pressure, the long-term consequences for the crypto ecosystem could be severe. “Can we fix the system if the vast majority of people still do not care unless they lose money? It’s concerning about what the long term ramifications may be even if these decisions benefit us in the short term. If you ever wanted the opportunity to extract from the industry there’s not been much of a better time. Take a chance what’s the worst thing that could happen if everyone’s already doing it?” Lazarus Group’s Latest Trap Lazarus Group was recently reported to have been shifting its social engineering tactics, now targeting centralized finance (CeFi) job seekers with a new malware campaign dubbed “ClickFix,” according to a recent report by cybersecurity firm Sekoia. Unlike previous attacks on developers, this method zeroes in on non-technical professionals by impersonating major crypto firms like Coinbase and Tether.

2025-06-18T16:30:53,"Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Could Rise 3x To $300,000 As AVIV Levels Resemble Previous Bull Cycles","Bitcoin has continued to hover above the $100,000 mark over the past few days, and its price action has stabilized around $105,000 in the wake of recent market tensions and despite inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs. A new analysis shared by crypto market commentator Gert van Lagen suggests that this current phase is going to precede an explosive move similar to those seen in previous market cycles. Backing his prediction with historical data and Glassnode’s AVIV Ratio chart, the analyst noted that the current on-chain structure echoes moments before Bitcoin’s major rallies in past bull markets. AVIV Ratio Flashes Familiar Pattern Before Market Top Bitcoin’s price volatility has slightly cooled since the initial surge to a new all-time high above $111,800 in May, and the latest candlestick structure suggests it may be preparing for another leg higher. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Price Bounce To $120,000 Or Will It Break Below $100,000? Taking to the social media platform X, Gert van Lagen revealed a Bitcoin price prediction that centers around the true market Deviation metric known as the AVIV Ratio. This orange-colored line on the chart tracks a specific deviation in Bitcoin’s market behavior and has always crossed a red line denoting +3 standard deviations at or just before cycle tops. The current AVIV behavior can be compared to previous price points before market tops in previous cycles. For instance, in 2013, the AVIV Ratio flagged a major rally when Bitcoin was trading near $200, shortly before the price pushed past $1,200. In 2017, the metric behaved similarly when Bitcoin was trading at $3,700 and later peaked near $20,000. The current AVIV Ratio can also be compared to when Bitcoin was priced at $13,000 in the 2021 bull market run, before its surge to an all-time high of $69,000. According to the analyst, today’s AVIV ratio level is closely aligned with those previous mid-cycle breakouts. The current ratio has not yet crossed the red +3σ line, which the analyst refers to as the cycle top trigger. As such, its current reading suggests Bitcoin may be in the early phase of a major bull market expansion. If history repeats itself, a 3x move from today’s levels would be a standard price move in line with previous price action. $300,000 Target Within Sight If AVIV Behavior Holds Crypto analyst van Lagen stops short of calling for an immediate top, but his analysis implies that Bitcoin could be preparing for a new parabolic surge to the upside. Using the AVIV model as a reference, a conservative 3x multiplier on the current Bitcoin price places a possible target around $300,000. Related Reading: Key Fractal From 2023 Says Bitcoin Price Is Still Bullish, But A Crash To $90,000 Could Be Coming At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,997, having decreased by 1.4% in the past 24 hours. This decline has brought its price down from an intraday high of $106,795 back into its consolidation range around $105,000.

2025-06-18T16:26:53,"Dogecoin Price Prediction: Liftoff Imminent as “Classic Reversal Pattern” Forms","Crypto analyst Crypto Sat has cautioned a “key reversal signal” on the 2-hour chart, noting that the recent deep correction may not prevail into the near-term Dogecoin price outlook . This comes as the meme coin retests the key historic support zone that marked the mid-April market bottom. Since a local top in mid-May, a 30% drop has put this level back in question. 2-Hour Chart Could Soon Flip the Scales According to analysis shared by Crypto Sat on X , Dogecoin is showing signs of accumulation following its sharp correction, with a potential double bottom pattern forming on the 2-hour chart. DOGE / USDT 2-hour chart, double bottom pattern. Source: X, @cryptosatred. This classic reversal pattern could signal a local bottom and pave the way for a bullish continuation, provided key technical levels hold. The first bottom formed around $0.168, where buyers stepped in to defend support following a sharp selloff. A second bounce here—accompanied by supporting volume—would be an “early bull sign,” though the key focus is placed at the $0.20 neckline resistance. The neckline could “decide the next big move”—a break above it would confirm the pattern and signal a sentiment shift favoring bulls. That said, a lower low below $0.165 could suggest increasing bearish pressure as buyers fail to defend the once strong support. Dogecoin Price Analysis: How This Ties into the Bigger Picture Zooming out, the $0.168 level aligns with a historically critical support zone, repeatedly marking local bottoms since mid-2024—the most recent being the mid-April market reversal. This support crosses a descending channel, forming the handle of a wider 4-year cup-and-handle pattern—a potential confluence zone for a breakout setup. DOGE / USDT 1-week chart, cup-and-handle confluence zone. Source: TradingView, Binance. A confirmed breakout would set a technical target around $0.75—a staggering 345% gain from current levels in line with the 1.618 Fibonacci extension. However, this bullish case only holds if the $0.168 support level is maintained, and momentum indicators are flashing caution. The golden cross from May has proven to be short-lived as the MACD line widens its gap below the signal line after a death cross to start June—a sign of a prevailing longer-term downtrend. The RSI also lends to weakening buy pressure, continuing its decline below the neutral line to its current position at 42. Below $0.168 lies a dangerous “gap area”—a price range with sparse previous buying activity, creating little historical support to limit downside. If lost, the next major support zone sits around 47% lower at $0.90, last tested during mid-2024. From there, all eyes turn to the June 15 US spot Dogecoin ETF decision, as a potential external catalyst, opening the doors to demand from traditional investment markets if approved. Bitcoin Could Have the Edge, With Some Help Those who jumped to speculative plays like Dogecoin over the leading crypto may be forced to reconsider as the Bitcoin ecosystem finally addresses its biggest limitation: scalability. Slow transactions, high fees, and limited programmability have held it back from competing with the Ethereum and Solana networks—until now. And this shift starts with Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Bitcoin’s first real-time Layer 2 that brings Solana-level speed and smart contracts directly to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and anchored by a decentralized Canonical Bridge, it enables fast, cheap, and composable dApps—all while staying secured by Bitcoin. With over $1.3 million in its third presale week, investors are already rallying behind $HYPER , potentially credited to its huge 651% APY on staking that rewards early investors.

2025-06-18T16:26:51,"Prenetics joins Bitcoin arms race with $20m buy and bold new board","In a move straight from the Strategy playbook, Prenetics has become the first health sciences firm to execute an aggressive Bitcoin treasury strategy, securing $20 million worth of BTC and appointing crypto veteran Andy Cheung to its board. According to a press release on June 18, Nasdaq-listed health sciences firm Prenetics Global has bought $20 million worth of Bitcoin ( BTC ), at an average price of $106,712 per token via Kraken. The move positions the company as the latest to join the corporate Bitcoin accumulation race started by Michael Saylor’s Strategy in August 2020. The Tysons Corner, Virginia-based firm pivoted to BTC with an initial purchase of $250 million and has accumulated over $60 billion worth of the original cryptocurrency in the last five years, proving that corporate treasuries can thrive under a Bitcoin standard. You might also like: Why are Bitcoin and crypto prices down today? Bitcoin meets biotech: a new vision for healthcare and finance Now, Prenetics is betting that healthcare, a sector traditionally cautious with capital allocation, can follow suit. With a $117 million war chest, zero debt, institutional financing partnerships, and a board now stacked with crypto heavyweights, the company isn’t just mimicking Strategy’s approach, it’s adapting it to an industry where digital assets remain uncharted territory. “We’re at the dawn of a new era where genomics, personalized medicine, and digital assets will intersect in ways that could revolutionize how we approach human health, longevity and wealth. To execute this vision at scale, we need substantial Bitcoin holdings – which is why we’re building one of the most significant Bitcoin treasuries in healthcare,” Danny Yeung, CEO of Prenetics, said. Alongside the Bitcoin purchase, the company made a strategic power move by appointing Andy Cheung, former COO of OKX, to its board. Cheung brings over a decade of experience at the highest levels of the crypto exchange world, having overseen billions in daily trading volume and architected complex trading infrastructure. Now the CEO of both OEX and PredicXion, Cheung’s insight into institutional-grade crypto strategies, from derivatives trading to yield optimization, embodies the kind of expertise Prenetics needs to transform its Bitcoin holdings from a static reserve into an active treasury engine. But he’s not alone. Prenetics has also enlisted Tracy Hoyos Lopez, the Kraken executive who orchestrated Donald Trump’s pro-Bitcoin pivot, and Raphael Strauch, founder of TOKEN2049, the world’s largest crypto conference. Together, they form a crypto advisory team that blends regulatory savvy, institutional connections, and hardcore trading expertise. Meanwhile, Prenetics’ Bitcoin strategy extends beyond the initial purchase. The company said it has secured board approval to allocate a majority of its balance sheet to BTC and deploy alpha-generating strategies, including yield farming and structured products. It also plans to begin accepting Bitcoin payments across its health platforms by year’s end.

2025-06-18T16:23:44,"Should Every Investor Own at Least 10,000 XRP If Betting on XRP long-term Potential","The conversation about the importance of holding 10,000 XRP tokens continues to gain traction within the XRP community. Most recently, widely followed YouTuber The Modern Investor reignited the debate in a tweet. He posed the question to the community, asking whether everyone should own at least 10,000 XRP tokens.Many community members agree, arguing that this threshold represents a solid position for those betting on XRP’s long-term potential.Owning 10,000 XRP Makes Sense If You Can Afford ItCommunity member Jack Joseph commented that if investors can afford it, owning 10,000 XRP makes sense. However, for those earning around $50,000 a year, holding between 500 and 1,000 XRP is more realistic. Meanwhile, Joseph added that he wouldn't recommend investing in XRP before owning some Bitcoin.Notably, X user Wasabi supported the idea of holding 10,000 XRP but acknowledged that most investors can barely afford 1,000.He emphasized the importance of dollar-cost averaging (DCA), noting that many of today’s large XRP holders accumulated their positions during the early and most intense phases of the SEC lawsuit. He believes such low price levels are unlikely to return.Other commentators cautioned that investors should only commit what they can afford to lose and shouldn't feel pressured to meet arbitrary thresholds set by others.""It’s a Luxury""Notably, buying 10,000 XRP requires a hefty financial commitment of around $23,000. In his commentary, crypto founder Edoardo Farina stressed that owning over 10,000 XRP is quickly becoming a luxury, as inflation and economic hardship force retail investors to sell.Those advocating for this holding often see it as a steppingstone to success. They frequently present hypothetical scenarios in which 10,000 XRP could be worth millions if the price per token surpasses $100.Recently, prominent XRP commentator Armando Pantoja argued that holding 10,000 XRP could one day be worth $2.5 million . This implies a future price of $250 per token. He compared this milestone to owning 1 Bitcoin or 50 Ethereum, stressing that financially savvy individuals should aim for such holdings.Currently, fewer than 4% of XRP wallets hold at least 10,000 tokens, highlighting how rare this level of accumulation is. Pantoja and other analysts argue that reaching this threshold could unlock financial freedom.Once the $2.5 million mark is achieved, Pantoja advises shifting to real estate or investments yielding 3–5% annually to preserve wealth and cover taxes.Strategy Matters More Than Portfolio SizeIn contrast, community figure Xena called the advice to target a specific holding amount ego-driven and unrealistic. She argued that financial literacy and smart strategy matter more than portfolio size. According to Xena, even disciplined small holders can outperform larger ones in the long run.This contrast highlights two mindsets in the XRP community: one promoting aggressive accumulation, the other advocating for realistic and strategic investing. The ultimate choice comes down to individual preference and risk tolerance.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/18/should-every-investor-own-at-least-10000-xrp-if-betting-on-xrp-long-term-potential/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=should-every-investor-own-at-least-10000-xrp-if-betting-on-xrp-long-term-potential,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today",cryptocompare

Bitcoin's price has dropped significantly after briefly reaching $108K this week, falling to around $103K in the past 24 hours. However, according to CryptoQuant analyst Carmelo Alemán, the Bitcoin Yearly Percentage Trend offers a clearer picture of the cryptocurrency’s long-term price cycle. By looking at Bitcoin's performance since 2011, it becomes evident that the crypto follows a predictable rhythm, with each three years of growth followed by a consolidation year. According to the analyst, understanding this pattern can help investors focus on the broader market forces that have shaped Bitcoin's price over the years.The Cyclical Nature of Bitcoin PriceBitcoin experienced steady growth from 2011 to 2013. In 2011, the cryptocurrency grew by a modest 10.5%, followed by a substantial 156.4% increase in 2012. In 2013, it surged by an astounding 5,549.2%, marking the highest growth rate on record.This explosive rally was followed by a sharp correction in 2014, with Bitcoin dropping 59.2%. The next two years—2015 and 2016—saw modest recoveries of 34.8% and 120.7%, respectively.A new bull run occurred in 2017, with Bitcoin climbing 1,287.4%. The following year, 2018, saw a steep 72.2% decline, consistent with the typical post-halving correction. In 2019, Bitcoin rebounded strongly, growing 92.1%.The uptrend continued into 2020 and 2021, with 2020 posting a 291.1% increase, the highest cycle growth. But 2022 marked another major correction, with a 64.8% drop.Bitcoin’s recovery resumed in 2023 and 2024, with growth of 156.5% and 118.7%, respectively. Early data suggests that 2025 has registered a more modest 12.5% gain. Alemán believes that if Bitcoin mirrors its typical third-year momentum, it could climb as much as 120%, potentially reaching $205,000 by the end of the year.Third Consecutive Bullish YearAccording to the analyst, if the current trend continues, 2025 could close as the third consecutive bullish year, completing another positive cycle for Bitcoin. Other metrics, like Realized Cap, support Bitcoin's cyclical nature, which reached new all-time highs in 2025. Bitcoin cyclical chart | CryptoQuant On-Chain Metrics and Open Interest DeltaMeanwhile, another significant metric being examined is the 180-day Open Interest (OI) Delta. According to crypto analytics platform Alphractal data, the OI Delta has recently turned negative, indicating that more leveraged positions closed than opened over the past few months. Major contributors to this decline include platforms like Bitget and CME, which together have seen over $10 billion in reduced open interest.Historically, a negative OI Delta has coincided with local market bottoms as observed in 2021 and 2023, often preceding significant price rebounds. A reversal in this trend, turning the OI Delta positive, could signal a renewed bullish phase.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/18/bitcoin-could-grow-120-in-2025-if-it-follows-typical-third-year-trend/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitcoin-could-grow-120-in-2025-if-it-follows-typical-third-year-trend,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","Market|Bitcoin Price Prediction|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today",cryptocompare

Based on historical price patterns, Bitcoin could rise to $145,000 by September 2025, according to a June 18 post on TradingView by TradingShot Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView The analysis highlighted the weekly timeframe as a key bullish signal, with Bitcoin closing five consecutive weekly candles above an important pivot trendline. This same level acted as strong resistance between December 9, 2024, and January 27, 2025, when all weekly closes remained below it. In contrast, recent candles have closed above the trendline, suggesting a change in market structure. The past two weekly candles were nearly flat, showing market consolidation led by a balance between buyers and sellers. Bitcoin’s possible 40% rally Using Fibonacci analysis, TradingShot set the 1.0 level at the pivot line, projecting the 2.0 extension just above $145,000, an almost 40% rally from the current prices. The positive outlook comes shortly after Bitcoin faced a notable downturn amid rising geopolitical tensions involving Iran. As reported by Finbold, the asset led a broader market sell-off during this time. However, institutional interest remains strong. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded over $1.46 billion in inflows since June 9, according to on-chain data from Santiment as of June 17, signaling continued confidence despite recent volatility.

2025-06-18T16:03:39,"Bitcoin DeFi Project Elastos Debuts BTC-Backed Stablecoin BTCD","A Bitcoin-blockchain based decentralized finance (DeFi) project debuted a stablecoin fully backed by bitcoin BTC tokens as part of its effort to build a financial system centered on the largest and oldest cryptocurrency. Elastos , developer of the BeL2 protocol, unveiled its bitcoin dollar (BTCD) on Wednesday. The project aims to create a digital version of the Bretton Woods system , the post-World War II agreement that pegged the U.S. dollar to gold, making the greenback the world's reserve currency as a means of fostering monetary stability. Elastos said it is ""reimagining [Bretton Woods] with Bitcoin at its core."" Stablecoins are tokens pegged to the value of a traditional financial asset, such as a fiat currency, usually the dollar. They're an important cog in the cryptocurrency machine because they counter the volatility of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, allowing users to hold capital in digital assets without having to factor in wild price swings. Dollar-pegged stablecoins are usually backed by short-term U.S. Treasuries that can easily be cashed in or purchased to meet fluctuating demand. BTCD is backed by bitcoin, a counterintuitive choice for a token that's mean to hold a stable value. Elastos deals with this through overcollateralization of 160%-200% of BTCD's value in bitcoin, Ahmed IJ, the head of marketing, told CoinDesk on Telegram. ""Oracles feed the BTC-USD rate each block,"" he said. ""If cover falls to 110%, arbitrage may repay the debt, grab the BTC at a small discount, and erase the risk. ""When BTCD trades above a dollar, holders burn it to reclaim BTC, supply falls and the price slides. If it dips below a dollar, users mint it with fresh BTC and sell, supply rises, price lifts."" The development of a BTC-backed stablecoin forms part of the broader development of bitcoin-powered DeFi , in which the security of the Bitcoin network and the vast reserves of BTC are used to secure and fund decentralized activity elsewhere in the blockchain world.

2025-06-18T16:02:04,"Analyst Says Bitcoin Has Topped Out and We Are Now Selling The Top","Analyst says we are selling the top amid the current Bitcoin bearish RSI divergence, signaling a potential correction. Bitcoin's price has recently reached $105,303, showing a modest 0.02% increase in the past 24 hours. However, it has experienced a 4.13% decline over the past week. As Bitcoin's price continues to struggle within this stagnation, analyst Captain Faibik highlights a possible topping out, signaling that the current price movement could be nearing its end.Earlier on, around late 2024 and early 2025, the price of Bitcoin continued to rise, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) signaled a weakening of buying momentum. RSI Shows Weakening MomentumThe RSI, sitting at 61.88 at the time of the analyst’s snapshot, peaked around 80 before trending downward. This shift in the RSI indicates that the momentum behind Bitcoin’s price movement is starting to fade. Historically, such a change often precedes a correction. Price Action Confirms Potential TopAnother key factor supporting the possibility of a Bitcoin price correction is the ascending trendline drawn from the high hit in December 2024. Bitcoin has struggled to break past the resistance levels at $109,000 and $111,000 formed around May 19, with the trendline capping its upward movement. According to Captain Faibik, these price points, along with the RSI divergence, suggest that Bitcoin may have reached its peak. As the market approaches these resistance zones, the likelihood of a pullback increases, with Faibik predicting a potential move toward the $92,000 to $94,000 range.A Similar Pattern from 2022This pattern is reminiscent of Bitcoin's price action in 2022. Back then, Bitcoin formed a descending trendline after hitting a bottom around $16,000. As the price consolidated, the RSI remained in an upward trend, despite being in the oversold region. This shift in momentum eventually led to a strong recovery in Bitcoin's price. While this comparison highlights a similar dynamic, it is important to note that the current market conditions and indicators suggest a different outcome. As Captain Faibik points out, buying the dip in 2022 worked out well, but the current signals indicate a strategy of selling the top.Derivatives Market Dynamics Add ContextMeanwhile, data from Bitcoin's derivatives market offers further insight into the current trading environment. Trading volume for Bitcoin derivatives has seen a slight increase of 1.62%, now standing at $100.76 billion. This uptick indicates growing market activity and interest in Bitcoin futures and options. Bitcoin Derivatives Data Bitcoin Derivatives Data However, open interest has decreased by 1.37%, totaling $69.70 billion. This drop suggests that traders are closing positions, possibly taking profits amid the recent price uncertainty. Additionally, the liquidations data reveals that a significant number of long positions have been affected. In the last 24 hours alone, $72.32 million in liquidations occurred, with the majority of losses impacting long positions.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/18/analyst-says-bitcoin-has-topped-out-and-we-are-now-selling-the-top/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=analyst-says-bitcoin-has-topped-out-and-we-are-now-selling-the-top,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Market|Bitcoin Price Prediction|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today",cryptocompare
2025-06-18T16:02:00,"Here’s why Michael Saylor’s Strategy stock price is about to surge","Strategy stock price has remained in a tight range in the past few weeks as Bitcoin has consolidated. MSTR was trading at $375 on Tuesday, down by over 12% from its highest point this year and 30% lower than the all-time high. This article provides a MSTR stock forecast and the key levels to watch. Strategy stock price technical analysis The daily chart shows that the MSTR share price bottomed at $231.70 in February, where it formed a double-bottom pattern with a neckline at $342.80. A double bottom is one of the most bullish reversal patterns, which explains why it rebounded and reached a high of $429.87. The stock has now formed a bullish pennant pattern, comprising of a vertical line and a symmetrical triangle, a popular bullish reversal sign in technical analysis. The two lines of this triangle are now nearing their confluence level, which happens before it stages a breakout. The profit target in a bullish pennant is estimated by first subtracting its lower side from its upper point. In this case, one subtracts $231 from $429, giving the flagpole height of $198. The next stage is where one adds the breakout point to the height. This breakout level could be about $385, which will bring the target to $583, which is about 55% above the current level. A drop below the support at $340 will invalidate the bullish Strategy stock price forecast. If this happens, the next point to watch will be the double-bottom point at $230. MSTR stock price chart | Source: TradingView Read more: This stock could nearly double your money in 2025—here’s why The bullish case for MSTR stock The main catalyst for Strategy stock is Bitcoin’s price action. A strong Bitcoin price surge will boost the value of its holdings and push its stock higher. Strategy has continued to accumulate Bitcoins. In a statement this week, the company said that it acquired over 10,000 new coins, bringing its cumulative total to over 590,000. Michael Saylor @saylor · Follow Strategy has acquired 10,100 BTC for ~$1.05 billion at ~$104,080 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 19.1% YTD 2025. As of 6/15/2025, we hodl 592,100 $BTC acquired for ~$41.84 billion at ~$70,666 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK $STRF $STRD strategy.com/press/strategy… 3:03 PM · Jun 16, 2025 6.1K Reply Copy link Read 777 replies Strategy has also insisted that it will not sell its coins anytime soon. Instead, the company is aiming to raise $84 billion to buy Bitcoin over time. A bullish case can be made for Bitcoin, as we wrote here . First, the world is running out of Bitcoin as the supply on exchanges plunge. There are now over 1.1 million coins on exchanges. While this is a big number, the supply stood at over 1.5 million in January and 3 million in 2021. Because of last year’s halving event, the number of Bitcoins being mined each day has crashed from 900 in April last year to 450 today. Companies like Strategy, MetaPlanet, and ETF issuers are buying all these coins. Therefore, the supply and demand dynamics mean that Bitcoin price will continue doing well in the long term. Michael Saylor believes that the coin will jump to $1 million in the near term and $5 million in the medium term. Ark Invest sees Bitcoin price surging to $2.4 million by the end of the year, while BlackRock sees it rising to $700,000. Therefore, if Bitcoin jumps to these levels, it means that the MSTR stock price will be higher even if the current premium ends. Bitcoin price technical analysis BTC price chart | Source: TradingView The long-term Bitcoin price chart points to more gains. It has formed a giant megaphone pattern, which is made up of two ascending and diverging trendlines. This is one of the most bullish patterns in technical analysis. Bitcoin price is attempting to break past the eight-year trendlines that connect the highest swings since December 17. It has also formed two large, rounded bottom patterns. Therefore, Bitcoin price will likely have a strong bullish breakout in the next few months. The initial target will be $150,000, followed by $200,000.
