At this point, Nasdaq-listed healthcare firm Prenetics Global has become the latest company to join the institutional Bitcoin accumulation race. Prenetics announced that it purchased $20 million worth of Bitcoin, becoming the first healthcare company to establish a Bitcoin treasury. Accordingly, the company purchased 187.42 BTC through its Kraken custody account at an average price of $106,712 per Bitcoin. Prenetics CEO Danny Yeung said the following regarding the BTC purchase: “With our strengthened balance sheet of $117 million in cash, BTC, and short-term assets, we now have the financial foundation to pioneer innovative treasury management approaches, including our historic bitcoin treasury strategy. But this is just the beginning; we have the capital partnerships and the conviction to build one of the most important Bitcoin treasuries in healthcare.” Tracy Hoyos Lopez, a former prosecutor who served as Head of Strategic Initiatives at Kraken, has also joined Prenetics as an advisor. Tracy Hoyos Lopez is one of those who convinced US President Donald Trump about Bitcoin. At this point, it was reported that those who convinced a person like Trump, who was against Bitcoin in the past, were Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey, Amanda Fabiano, one of the most important names in Bitcoin mining, and Tracy Hoyos-Lopez, a former California prosecutor. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-18T19:55:13,"BlackRock’s $2,900,000,000 Tokenized Money Market Fund To Be Used by Crypto.com and Deribit: Report","BlackRock’s multibillion-dollar tokenized money market fund ( BUIDL ) is reportedly going to be used by the crypto exchange platforms Derebit and Crypto.com. According to a new report from Forbes, both crypto exchanges will accept BUIDL as collateral, meaning that traders can now use the yield-bearing stablecoin as a security deposit to hedge leveraged bets, freeing up more of their capital to be used elsewhere. As stated by Michael Sonnenshein, chief operating officer at Securitize, a partner of BlackRock, “This is a major turning point. We’re really starting to see not just the emergence but a real solidification of tokenized securities becoming a challenger to stablecoins as the common denominator across the crypto ecosystem. They’re now becoming what we would consider programmable productive capital, as opposed to just a passive investment instrument used for yield or a safe place to park capital.” BUIDL – which launched in March 2024 – quickly expanded across multiple blockchains, including layer-2 scaling solutions Arbitrum ( ARB ), Optimism ( OP ), and Polygon ( POL ), and has $2.9 billion in assets. According to the report, Crypto.com will make BUIDL available for institutional clients in select jurisdictions across its full suite of services, while Derebit, the largest crypto options exchange by volume, which normally takes collateral in the form of Bitcoin ( BTC ), will make BUIDL available on its spot exchange. The report also notes that BUIDL may soon become available over the top US-based crypto exchange platform Coinbase, as the firm is currently in the process of acquiring Derebit.

2025-06-18T19:47:00,"Bitcoin And Ethereum Outlook As Crypto Markets Hold Tight Throughout Anxious Sentiment (Technical Analysis)","Summary Bitcoin is trading in a volatile range but still consolidating above the 100,000 Key mark, and Ethereum, which attempted a breakout last week, saw this attempt rejected and is now back to its initial range. The largest cryptocurrency is now hanging around its 4H 200-period moving average, right now at 104,870 as markets brace for the upcoming FOMC rate decision. ETH is stalling at the low of its range, and buyers are looking to hold the 2,500 key mark, which the 4H MA 200 is acting as immediate support. By Elior Manier Cryptocurrency markets are holding tight despite anxious and volatile conditions. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is trading in a volatile range but still consolidating above the 100,000 Key mark, and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), which attempted a breakout last week, saw this attempt rejected and is now back to its initial range. New highs are tough to attain for risk-assets as the market tone gets more pessimistic, however, one of the first uses for cryptocurrencies is a hedge against fiat currencies that get thrown around amid geopolitical turmoil – Something to keep in check if anything major materializes. The total market cap for cryptocurrencies is holding above $3 trillion – Keep this in check to spot any major outflows. The total market cap came shy of $3.5T as Bitcoin hit its last record highs of $112,000, but still hasn't broken the $3.70T record hit in December 2024. Total Crypto Market Cap from 2020 to Today (18/06/2025) – Source: TradingView Bitcoin, Ethereum and ETH/BTC 4H Charts Bitcoin 4H Chart Bitcoin has seen some quite volatile moves with major selloffs and rallies within the 100,000 to 110,000 range – staying around this mark consolidates prices as more volume is traded at these levels. Monday's attempt to retest the high of the range got met with a sharp reversal in sentiment . The largest cryptocurrency is now hanging around its 4H 200-period moving average, right now at 104,870 as markets brace for the upcoming FOMC rate decision.As a non interest-yielding asset, a cut would be beneficial to the risk-asset, although the Fed is largely expected to maintain current rates for this meeting. ETF inflows are still positive, though not as strong as they were earlier in 2025 – The consistency of inflows is also assisting Bitcoin to stay bid. Ethereum 4H Chart Ethereum 4H Chart, June 18, 2025 – Source: TradingView ETH is stalling at the low of its range, and buyers are looking to hold the 2,500 key mark , which the 4H MA 200 is acting as immediate support for. Prices are still consolidating in a $400 range, with lows between $2,400 and highs closer to $2,800. The second-largest cryptocurrency had failed to hold what is now the immediate 2,750 resistance zone as the more anxious mood weighed on the buying flows, preventing the breakout attempt. Any break below the Major Support 1 zone (2,385 to 2,425) would point toward a retest of the Early May levels closer to the $2,000 milestone. On the other hand, if buyers manage to sustain the current prices, a strong return to the 2,600 Pivot zone and a break of the 4H 50-period moving average ($2,621) would demand even more strength to break the immediate resistance zone and revisit early June highs – Still a possibility as Bitcoin holds above 100,000. To resume the bullish trend, the level to breach is $2,880 ; any major move mirroring the May upward shift would point at $3,440. Bulls would have to step in heavily to achieve this outcome. ETH/BTC Line Chart ETH/BTC hasn't had the occasion to break out from its current consolidation range. A descent upmove in Ethereum prices would be required to regain late 2024 levels with highs close to 0.04. The all-time highs for the spread are closer to 0.14, though even going back to 0.04 would give significant relative strength to the Ether and other altcoins. Safe Trades!

2025-06-18T19:44:22,"Arthur Hayes Questions James Wynn’s Intentions: Engagement Farming?","Arthur Hayes has questioned the motivations behind recent high-profile moves by crypto investor James Wynn. He suggested that the trader’s actions might be more driven by a desire for engagement rather than making actual earnings. Airdrop Farming Allegations In a clip shared by Laura Shin, host of the Unchained Podcast, Hayes commented on Wynn’s latest moves: “I think he farmed the airdrop. I don’t think he took a billion dollars of Delta on Bitcoin.” Wynn is a well-known investor who has gotten attention from the crypto community for his bold and high-risk trading strategies. In the past, the whale has bet more than $1 billion on Bitcoin (BTC). His most recent move saw him unstake and sell his entire holding of 126,116 HYPE tokens for approximately $4.13 million. He had originally bought the tokens on May 9 and 12 at an average price of $24.84, then sold them at $32.72 each, locking in a 31.9% profit on his $3.13 million investment. After cashing out, the trader withdrew all his USDC from Hyperliquid and announced a break from perpetual trading after booking a net loss of $17.5 million from his recent bets. What’s notable is that this sell-off came hours before Wynn’s new $99.5 million Bitcoin long position on Hyperliquid . Hayes argued that if Wynn had truly taken on a billion-dollar Delta position, he wouldn’t have publicized it on social media, exposing himself to targeted attacks. The BitMEX co-founder described the move as a well-executed strategy to generate attention, speculating that Wynn would likely receive a sizable amount of HYPE tokens from the airdrop. He added that the pseudonymous trader probably didn’t lose money and may have used other accounts or split his positions across different wallets to remain delta-neutral. According to him, any losses from trading fees would also have been offset by the potential value of the tokens received in the airdrop. Hayes Questions Hyperliquid’s Future In a separate video shared by Shin, Hayes also raised a key concern about whether Hyperliquid’s current valuation and user base will be sustainable once U.S.-based giants like Coinbase and Robinhood roll out perpetual trading platforms. The 40-year-old explained that Hyperliquid currently serves users who can’t access centralized exchanges due to regulatory restrictions. However, he pointed out that once these major players start offering perpetuals with easier access, some of Hyperliquid’s 20,000 to 30,000 active traders might migrate. Hayes added that even though those platforms would probably offer lower leverage, the convenience and regulatory clarity could be enough to lure users away.

2025-06-18T19:35:33,"Bitcoin to $250K or Ozak AI to $1—Which Will Hit Its Price Target First in 2025?","Bitcoin and Ozak AI are two of the most talked-about names within the 2025 crypto forecast. While Bitcoin eyes a enormous surge to $250,000, Ozak AI, presently in its 4th presale stage at $0.005, aims for a $1 milestone. Both have sturdy narratives: Bitcoin with institutional adoption, and Ozak AI with AI-powered statistics analytics that bring innovation to the blockchain space. The big question for investors is—which one will attain its goal first? Bitcoin’s Bullish Channel and Price Levels Bitcoin’s price chart is presently forming an ascending channel, which commonly indicators continued bullish momentum. This pattern features higher highs and higher lows inside a described upward slope, regularly suggesting that any pullback is much more likely to be accompanied by means of a rebound. Within this channel, Bitcoin suggests key support levels at $57,000, $61,500, and $66,000—representing zones where buyers have formerly stepped in. On the resistance side, BTC faces hurdles at $seventy four,000, $88,000, and a psychological barrier around $100,000 before it is able to realistically method the $250K mark. While the $250K goal is aggressive, some analysts consider Bitcoin’s halving cycle and growing ETF demand could fuel that rise—even though it could take time. Ozak AI’s Disruptive Edge and Entry Price Ozak AI offers a radically different opportunity. At just $0.005, the upside potential is massive. The platform specializes in predictive AI and decentralized analytics for financial markets, combining the Ozak Stream Network (OSN), DePIN technology, and customizable Prediction Agents (PAs). These features allow it to process real-time data securely and efficiently, giving it a significant edge in the growing AI-blockchain intersection. Ozak AI vs Bitcoin: Which One Gets There First? While Bitcoin has the trust of the global financial community, it also moves with more inertia. A move from $70,000 to $250,000 would still be a historic rally, but could take several years and macro tailwinds. In contrast, Ozak AI’s tiny market cap and innovative use case could drive exponential gains in a much shorter time—especially as it garners attention from both AI and crypto communities. Both Bitcoin and Ozak AI offer compelling upside in 2025, but from a sheer percentage return and timeline standpoint, Ozak AI appears better positioned to hit its $1 target before Bitcoin touches $250,000. With AI as a megatrend and blockchain’s growing appetite for utility, Ozak AI may indeed outpace the king of crypto in the next bull cycle. About Ozak AI Ozak AI is a blockchain-based crypto project that provides a technology platform that specializes in predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets. Through machine learning algorithms and decentralized network technologies, Ozak AI enables real-time, accurate, and actionable insights to help crypto enthusiasts and businesses make the correct decisions.

On Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell announced that the Fed Funds Rate will remain between 4.25 percent and 4.5 percent. During his speech on Wednesday, Powell said that the near-term inflation expectations have moved up fueled by tariff wars. Earlier on Wednesday, President Donald Trump reiterated that the Fed should cut its benchmark interest rate and should be 2.5 points lower. What Next for the Crypto Market The crypto market has experienced heightened bearish sentiment amid the ongoing Middle East crisis. With the Fed announcing its intent to continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and bonds, popularly known as Quantitative Tightening (QT), the short term bearish sentiment will likely persist. “The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective,” the Fed noted . Meanwhile, 12 Fed officials see at least one rate cut before the end of this year while 7 Fed officials expect a no rate cut before EOY. According to LSEG data, the U.S. interest rate futures have a 71 percent chance that the Fed will cut its rate in September. As Coinpedia has previously reported , the wider crypto market will likely experience an accumulation summer in the coming months before an epic rally before the end of this year. A similar narrative was coined by crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen, who predicted that the altcoin market will continue to bleed to Bitcoin in the coming months.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-market-faces-short-term-bearish-sentiment-after-fed-left-interest-rate-unchanged-akin-to-boj/,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations",cryptocompare

2025-06-18T19:30:11,"US Stock Markets See Promising Open: What It Means for the Crypto Market","BitcoinWorld US Stock Markets See Promising Open: What It Means for the Crypto Market Hello crypto enthusiasts! While our focus is typically on the fascinating world of digital assets, it’s crucial to keep an eye on traditional finance, specifically the US stock markets . Why? Because what happens on Wall Street often sends ripples through the crypto market. Today, we saw the major US indices open higher, a move that always piques the interest of investors looking for broader market sentiment cues. US Stock Markets Open Higher: The Initial Numbers Let’s get straight to the numbers reported at the open today. The key indices showed modest gains: S&P 500 : Opened up by +0.09% NASDAQ : Opened up by +0.12% Dow Jones Industrial Average (Dow) : Opened up by +0.05% These are the initial movements as the trading day began. While seemingly small, opening trends can sometimes set the tone for the day, reflecting investor optimism or caution based on overnight news, economic data releases, or corporate announcements. Understanding the Market Correlation with the Crypto Market You might be wondering, ‘Why should I care about the S&P 500 or the NASDAQ when I’m invested in Bitcoin or Ethereum?’ Great question! There’s a growing market correlation between traditional risk-on assets, particularly technology stocks which heavily influence the NASDAQ, and the cryptocurrency market. Here’s a simple way to look at it: Risk Appetite: When investors feel confident about the economy and are willing to take on more risk (a ‘risk-on’ environment), they tend to invest in growth stocks and, increasingly, cryptocurrencies. Positive moves in the stock market can signal this confidence. Institutional Flow: Many larger investment firms now hold positions in both traditional stocks and digital assets. Their decisions to allocate capital can impact both markets simultaneously. Macroeconomic Factors: Interest rates, inflation data, geopolitical events – these factors influence investor sentiment across *all* asset classes, creating synchronized movements. Therefore, a positive opening in US stock markets , especially the tech-heavy NASDAQ , is often viewed as a positive signal for the broader risk-on trade, which can sometimes benefit the crypto market . What Does This Slight Positive Movement Signify? A slight positive opening, like the one seen today with gains around 0.1%, isn’t necessarily a massive breakout, but it indicates that sellers weren’t dominant at the open. It suggests a baseline level of confidence or perhaps anticipation of favorable news later in the day. For the crypto market , this sort of steady opening in stocks is generally a neutral to slightly positive sign. It avoids the panic selling that might occur if stocks opened sharply lower, which could drag down crypto prices due to the correlation we discussed. It allows the crypto market to potentially move based on its own internal catalysts or maintain stability. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, how can you use this information? Don’t make drastic investment decisions based solely on a stock market opening percentage. Instead, consider it as one piece of the puzzle: Monitor the Trend: Watch how the stock markets perform throughout the day. Does the initial gain hold, or do prices reverse? Identify Key Levels: For traders, observing how major indices react around key support or resistance levels can offer clues about overall market strength. Understand Sentiment: Use the stock market’s performance as a gauge for general investor risk appetite. Is the mood risk-on or risk-off? Diversify Wisely: Recognizing the correlation highlights the importance of a well-rounded investment strategy that considers how different asset classes might move together. While the S&P 500 and NASDAQ opening higher is a positive data point, remember that the crypto market also has its unique drivers, including technological developments, regulatory news, and adoption rates. In summary, US stock markets opened slightly higher today, with the S&P 500 , NASDAQ , and Dow all posting small gains. This positive start in traditional finance is relevant to the crypto market due to the observable market correlation , often signaling a risk-on environment. While not a guarantee of crypto price movements, it’s a useful indicator for understanding the broader financial landscape.

The GitHub activity affected repositories for the Keeper Wallet, potentially compromising Waves ecosystem users. Waves Protocol may be compromised by malicious code introduced in its old GitHub repositories. Investigators discovered activity in the Keeper Wallet repos after two years of no updates. The newly added code may be traced to a DPRK hacker , who seems to have gained complete credentials to the project’s GitHub. The discovery happens just at the time when Waves is trying to revive the project and kick off Waves Summer 2025. The newly introduced code may put new users at risk. 1/ ☀️ Waves Summer 2025 — Turning the Tide 🏄🏻‍♂️ The next 90 days will reshape Waves into an AI-native, L2-integrated, and institutionally anchored blockchain powerhouse. Here’s what’s ahead 👇🌊 pic.twitter.com/R5uycNgRSA — Waves 🌊 (@wavesprotocol) June 18, 2025 Waves was one of the high-profile ICOs in 2018, though it managed to raise just $18M. Waves was also prominent in the early crypto ecosystem, being one of the first protocols to offer tokenized versions of BTC. The Waves protocol was also the venue for multiple crypto scams and fake tokens. Waves was largely forgotten after its native WAVES token crashed by 93% in 2022, from a peak above $55. WAVES later sank to recent lows of $0.99. Reportedly, the project’s founder, Sasha Ivanov, used the USDN stablecoin to pump WAVES, later leading to a series of rug pulls. Waves used the chaotic early-stage DeFi, causing up to $500M in losses. However, unlike FTX, Luna, and other crashes in 2022, Waves was never investigated, and the events were forgotten. In 2025, Waves is attempting to make a return, with the double risk of financial losses and outright compromised wallets. Waves repos linked to DPRK hacking activity Researchers from Ketman threat intelligence were scanning GitHub repositories for signs of hacking and the involvement of DPRK contributors. The scans follow several cases where DPRK developers infiltrated some of the biggest crypto projects. Suspicious activity was noticed in the Keeper wallet repo, which offered access to a browser extension wallet specifically created for the Waves ecosystem. Keeper Project is a spinoff of Waves and does not share teams. The early Waves team was also involved in building the wallet. Then, in the last three weeks, the repository started to receive new code. The suspicious account had full authority and was capable of controlling the repository and even making new wallet releases. The rights to the wallet release were linked to one GitHub account , which was suspected to belong to a DPRK hacker. The account included a potentially dangerous download link for the Keeper Wallet. So far, there is no new release for Keeper, and the current wallet is considered relatively safe. However, a new release may be suspicious and cause harm, especially with the expected renewed marketing of Waves. The GitHub contributor AhegaoXXX also pushed an update that targeted and extracted wallet logs and errors to an external database, compromising privacy and being potentially malicious. The code may have capabilities to log wallet keys or phrases, though for now, it has not been added to the latest wallet release. Some of the code linked to Keeper Wallet has been published by the account of developer Maxim Smolyakov , leading the investigators to suspect some form of account takeover.

2025-06-18T19:20:11,"Explosive Reports: Israel Targets Khamenei Headquarters in Tehran Amid Rising Middle East Tension","BitcoinWorld Explosive Reports: Israel Targets Khamenei Headquarters in Tehran Amid Rising Middle East Tension In a development sending ripples across global political and financial circles, including those monitoring cryptocurrency market sensitivity to geopolitical events, reports have emerged suggesting a significant escalation in the long-standing Israel Iran conflict . According to accounts circulating in Israeli media, as cited by JinSe Finance, Israel is reportedly targeting the underground headquarters of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei located in Tehran. This specific report, if confirmed, marks a potentially drastic shift in the nature of confrontations between the two regional adversaries. While Israel and Iran have engaged in a ‘shadow war’ for years, involving cyberattacks, proxy conflicts, and targeted strikes on military or nuclear facilities, a direct attack on the alleged Khamenei headquarters would represent a major escalation targeting the core of Iran’s leadership. Understanding the Deep Roots of the Israel Iran Conflict To grasp the gravity of reports concerning a potential Tehran attack targeting such a high-value location, it’s crucial to understand the historical context of the animosity between Israel and Iran. Their rivalry isn’t new; it’s a complex web of ideological, political, and strategic disagreements that have shaped the Middle East for decades. Ideological Divide: Following the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran adopted a strongly anti-Israel stance, viewing the country as an illegitimate entity and a tool of Western influence. Regional Hegemony: Both nations vie for influence in the Middle East, supporting opposing sides in conflicts across Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, and elsewhere. Iran’s Nuclear Program: Israel views Iran’s pursuit of nuclear capabilities as an existential threat, leading to covert operations and diplomatic efforts to hinder the program. Military Posturing: Both countries maintain significant military capabilities and have engaged in various forms of indirect confrontation. This enduring tension means that any report of direct engagement, particularly one targeting leadership infrastructure, immediately heightens concerns about broader regional instability and potential spillover effects. Why Target Khamenei Headquarters? Potential Implications The choice of targeting an alleged Khamenei headquarters , especially an underground facility often associated with command and control, suggests a strategic aim beyond typical proxy skirmishes. While details remain scarce and confirmation pending, the implications of such an attack could be profound. Targeting the perceived nerve center of Iran’s leadership could theoretically aim to: Degrade Command and Control: Disrupting the ability of the Supreme Leader and his inner circle to direct military and political operations. Send a Strong Deterrent Message: Signalling Israel’s willingness to strike at the highest levels of Iranian power. Impact Morale: Undermining confidence within the Iranian leadership and potentially the population. However, such a high-profile target also comes with immense risks. The potential for a severe Iranian retaliation is significant, raising fears of a wider conflict that could engulf the region. This contributes directly to heightened Middle East tension . Verifying the Report: Challenges and Considerations It is crucial to approach reports like this with caution. The initial source cited is Israeli media, relayed by JinSe Finance. Military operations of this sensitivity are often shrouded in secrecy, and immediate, independent verification is difficult. Both sides in the Israel Iran conflict frequently engage in information warfare. Challenges in verifying the report include: Lack of official confirmation from either Israel or Iran. Difficulty in obtaining independent visual or satellite confirmation of a strike on an underground facility in a heavily guarded area like Tehran. The possibility of the report being a deliberate leak or psychological operation. Until further credible evidence emerges, the report remains just that – a report based on Israeli media claims. However, the mere circulation of such a report during a period of already elevated geopolitical risk is noteworthy and impactful. Geopolitical Risk and Market Reactions: What to Watch Major escalations in the Israel Iran conflict have a history of impacting global markets. While direct effects are often seen in oil prices due to the region’s importance in energy supply, the ripple effects can extend to other assets, including the volatile cryptocurrency market. Increased geopolitical risk often leads investors towards perceived safe-haven assets, though definitions of ‘safe haven’ can vary and are debated, especially concerning Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Conversely, heightened uncertainty can also trigger risk-off sentiment, leading to sell-offs across various asset classes. Key indicators to watch in the wake of such reports include: Movements in crude oil prices. Changes in global stock market indices.

For Bitcoin, the stable interest rates could serve as a bullish catalyst, especially as investor sentiment shifts towards alternative stores of value. This could be a bullish signal for the BTC price rally, which is striving hard to break the barrier at $106,800. FED Rates Hold: What Does This Mean to the Crypto Market? The market analysts were sure of a rate cut today, but the US Federal Reserve kept the interest rates unchanged. By pausing the rate hikes, the Fed is signaling that inflation may be stabilizing and economic conditions do not require tight monetary policy. These decisions reduce market uncertainty and encourage capital flow into stocks and cryptos, specifically Bitcoin. Meanwhile, President Trump called the FED Chair, Jerome Powell, ‘Stupid’ for not lowering the rates. He said that the FED has kept the borrowing cost too high, which has been costing America billions of dollars. Moreover, the President believes the rates should have been two interest points lower. The FED currently holds interest rates between the range of 4.25% and 4.50%. While Bitcoin has held stable since the early trading hours, it is now experiencing a sell-off. What’s Next for the Bitcoin Price? Markets remain on edge as Powell’s cautious tone keeps rate cut hopes in check—expectations are locked in for no move. However, the traders are glued to micro-signals in Fed projections for any dovish tilt. Bitcoin and altcoins chopped on FOMC week, with volumes spiking around Powell’s Q&A and macro narrative shifts. Besides, Bitcoin price remains in an indecisive spot after the FED’s interest rate tone. Powell’s confidence in macro strength is fueling bullish sentiment, but the technicians flash caution. ETF inflow and supply crunch are supporting the broader uptrend, but the short-term chart shows an oversold RSI and a bearish MACD cross. Market participants need to watch $102K and $104K closely; holding this support could set up for a sharp recovery if macro signals align. Bulls are eyeing institutional moves and on-chain growth, while bears highlight short-term volatility and macro uncertainty.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/fed-rates-remain-unchanged-what-does-this-mean-for-bitcoin-the-crypto-markets/,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-06-18T19:06:21,"Why is Bitcoin becoming ‘central” to investment portfolios and will it last?","Once deemed too volatile and speculative for serious investors – Bitcoin is increasingly being seen as a viable asset for mainstream portfolios, according to Philippe Laffont. The founder of tech-focused hedge fund Coatue Management explained the reason why markets have had a change of heart about BTC as he spoke at Coinbase’s State of Crypto Summit last week. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at north of $105,000, which is more than 50% above its year-to-date low on April 9, only days after President Trump’s tariffs announcement. Lower volatility is increasing institutional support for Bitcoin According to Philippe Laffont, institutional attitude towards Bitcoin is improving mostly because the asset’s volatility, which historically deterred firms like Coatue from building a position, is now declining, and that too, significantly. “It’s intriguing to me that maybe … the cost of getting into BTC is shrinking, he said, referring to the asset’s beta – a measure of its volatility relative to the broader market. Lower beta, in his view, is making Bitcoin more accessible and even attractive for cautious investors in 2025. Additionally, the growing presence of institutional names, particularly big ones like BlackRock, that’s even launched a Spot Bitcoin ETF is being seen as a major sign of maturity in the crypto space. Once a fringe asset, BTC is now being legitimized by major financial institutions, which is helping reduce perceived risks, Laffont added. Comparative performance is also contributing to changing investor perceptions – Bitcoin has demonstrated relative resilience in recent macroeconomic shocks. For example, when markets reacted to President Trump’s tariff announcement in April , Bitcoin lost only 5% versus a wider 6% decline seen in the Nasdaq Composite. This decoupling from traditional tech-heavy indices suggests BTC may now offer diversification benefits rather than simply tracking risk-on sentiment. BTC long-term holding behaviour signals growing confidence Another telling indicator is how investors are treating their holdings after buying Bitcoin, Laffont noted as he addressed the Summit. The number of wallets that held bitcoin for over a month and then sold out entirely has declined significantly, which implies a shift toward a long-term investment mindset among holders, rather than speculative day trading. Bitcoin currently makes up less than 1% of the global net worth. According to Philippe Laffont, if the assets continue gaining credibility, “it has to become more central” to diversified portfolios. While he once overlooked the cryptocurrency’s potential, Laffont now embraces one of its simplest characteristics: “As long as other people think it’s valuable, it gets more valuable over time.” Bitcoin is currently up nearly 100% versus its 52-week low, but the hedge fund manager continues to see significant further upside in the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap. He concluded on a rhetorical question: “why wouldn’t everyone have one, two, three or 4% of assets in Bitcoin that … protects you against inflation ?” The post Why is Bitcoin becoming ‘central” to investment portfolios and will it last? appeared first on Invezz",invezz,https://invezz.com/news/2025/06/18/why-is-bitcoin-becoming-central-to-investment-portfolios-and-will-it-last/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Crypto|North America|World|Bitcoin|USA",cryptocompare
2025-06-18T19:01:01,"Lion Group Holding announces $600m facility for HYPE treasury strategy","Hyperliquid continues to draw major institutional interest as another Nasdaq-listed firm, Lion Group Holding Ltd (LGHL), announces a $600 million facility to launch a HYPE-focused treasury strategy. Lion Group Holding Ltd, listed on Nasdaq and offering a trading platform for a suite of products that includes total return swaps, contract-for-difference and over-the-counter stock options, announced its move on June 18, 2025. That’s just a day after Eyenovia, a U.S.-based ophthalmic technology firm, said it planned to deploy $50 million into a Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) treasury initiative. The news hasn’t catalyzed fresh gains for HYPE price, notably amid prevailing market conditions . However, Eyenovia and LGHL highlight the growing institutional interest in the native token of Hyperliquid, a decentralized finance-focused blockchain and platform. LGHL eyes Hyperliquid (HYPE) treasury with initial $600m According to Lion Group, the objective is clear: build the largest Hyperliquid treasury in the world. Eyenovia has expressed similar ambitions, hinting at a potential race to become the “Strategy of HYPE.” Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) remains the top corporate holder of Bitcoin ( BTC ) on its balance sheet among publicly-listed companies. The U.S.-based firm has inspired a whole range of BTC treasury firms – with Ethereum, XRP and Solana now seeing similar trends.

LGHL is relaunching its crypto operations to align with its entry into the DeFi ecosystem, noting in a press release: The company is relaunching its crypto operations amid the quest to tap into the decentralized finance ecosystem, LGHL noted in a press release. “Hyperliquid represents a natural extension of LGHL’s existing derivatives business into decentralized markets, and reflects our conviction that decentralized on-chain execution is the future of trading,” Wilson Wang, chief executive officer of LGHL, said. “We view protocols like HYPE, with decentralized sequencing, as foundational to building scalable DeFi systems.” The company is also considering secondary listings on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and Singapore Exchange, which would make it the first HYPE treasury firm publicly listed in Asia. LGHL also eyes Solana, Sui treasury initiaives According to Lion Group Holding CEO Wilson Wang, the launch of the HYPE treasury isn’t the company’s only plan. An on-chain vision also includes treasury reserves built with other layer-1 tokens. That means plans for the strategic accumulation of Solana ( SOL ) and Sui ( SUI ). If this happens, the company will use BitGo to custody and stake its SOL and SUI. “We may also allocate to Solana (SOL), a leader in consumer-facing applications, and Sui (SUI), a performant, composable layer-1 with recent backing from Eric Trump’s World Liberty Financial – both forming key pillars to our treasury strategy focused on execution-first protocols,” Wang noted. SOL is the sixth largest cryptocurrency by market cap with over $76 billion. Meanwhile, HYPE and SUI are currently the 11th and 12th largest with $12.9 billion and $9.4 billion respectively.

2025-06-18T19:00:26,"Stablecoins market cap hits an all-time high of $256 billion","The total stablecoins market capitalization surged to an all-time high on Wednesday, data shows that the coins recorded $256 billion, up 22% this year. This surge has been fueled by the US Senate’s approval of the GENIUS Act by a 68-30 vote, marking the first major crypto bill to pass the Senate. Although it still needs approval from the House and President Trump, the bill has made it through the hardest steps. Stablecoin market cap in 5 years Stablecoins have become a core part of the crypto industry. In Q1 2025 alone, stablecoins accounted for 28% of total crypto transaction volume. Meanwhile, USDT continues to dominate the market, accounting for over half of the total market capitalization at 155 billion. USDC follows with a market capitalization of 61 billion. Investors plan to launch more stablecoins As the bill progresses, Trump is getting more personally involved with stablecoins. World Liberty Financial, a crypto company backed by President Trump and his sons, together with BitGo, has launched its own stablecoin that is pegged to the US dollar (USD1). However, the Genius Act bans members of Congress and their families from earning profits from stablecoins, but not President Trump and his family. This omission has irked some Democrats and slowed progress on the legislation this spring. Many big companies, from rumored giant lenders to mega stores, are already thinking about whether to make their own coins. For instance, at a Morgan Stanley conference, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan talked about the company’s plans for a stablecoin last week. “We’re working with the industry, working individually,” he said. This month, Bank of America and other large banks got together to discuss the possibility of launching a collaborative stablecoin network. Also, last week, the Wall Street Journal said that Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT) are looking into stablecoin possibilities. “While we continuously explore new payment technologies in efforts to support our customers, we are not piloting any programs and do not currently have any plans in place to issue our own stablecoin,” a Walmart spokesperson said. Some Democrats, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, have raised these concerns. They have cited that the bill will allow big tech companies like Amazon or Meta (META) start their own stablecoins. However, Disparte pointed out that the bill says any tech company that wants to make a stablecoin must first get permission from a special committee at the Treasury Department. The rest of the crypto market takes a dip Circle is a sign of growing investor enthusiasm for stablecoins as the legislation advances in Congress. Its stock has soared roughly 400% since its debut day of trading on June 5. The crypto market expects stablecoins to rally more after the bill passes. The head of that department, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, also has high hopes for what the legislation may mean. He told lawmakers last week that the legislation could help push the US stablecoin market beyond $2 trillion by the end of 2028. Meanwhile, the global crypto market continues to tumble as escalating tensions in the Middle East prompted investors to flee riskier assets. The cumulative crypto market cap dropped by almost 2% over the last day to stand at $3.26 trillion. The 24-hour trading volume also took a hit of around 9% to drop to $121 billion. The biggest crypto token, BTC, has not done much. It has remained steady at the $104k level. This suggests that traders might take a halt now.

Newly filed court documents indicate Mashinsky withdrew his claims in light of his criminal sentencing last month. Celsius filed for bankruptcy in July 2022 after its native token, CEL, plummeted by 99%, and it was unable to fulfill withdrawals. Mashinsky was arrested in 2023 and pleaded guilty to one count of commodities fraud and one count of securities fraud last December. The Department of Justice (DOJ) said the Celsius founder falsely represented the lender as a safe and secure platform and exaggerated its potential for profitability, greatly inflating its user base. Last month, a US district judge sentenced Mashinsky to 12 years in prison. After the sentencing, US Attorney Jay Clayton said the Celsius founder targeted retail investors with false promises, used customer funds to place risky bets and profited tens of millions of dollars while his customers lost billions. “America’s investors deserve better. The case for tokenization and the use of digital assets is strong but it is not a license to deceive.

2025-06-18T18:41:00,"‘Next Parabolic Move’ for Bitcoin Approaching As Two Historically Reliable Macro Indicators Flash Green, According to Analyst","A closely followed crypto analyst says Bitcoin ( BTC ) could be on the cusp of its next explosive rally, as two key macroeconomic indicators with a track record of accurately predicting bull runs flash green. In a newly released macro report , pseudonymous analyst TechDev highlights the copper-to-gold ratio and M2 money’s supply year-over-year change as critical signals pointing to a brewing Bitcoin surge. The copper/gold ratio, often viewed as a proxy for economic risk appetite, has begun to trend upward – a move TechDev notes has historically preceded BTC bull markets by several months. “As of mid-2025, the ratio has stopped declining and is stabilizing, even showing signs of turning higher. This suggests that investors are beginning to anticipate recovery. If copper begins to outperform gold in the coming quarters, it would signal a bottoming of the business cycle – precisely the kind of macro regime change that supports a bitcoin bull run.” Source: TechDev And the analyst says global M2 money supply – a broad measure of liquidity in the world financial system – has flipped from negative to positive annual growth, also a signal that he says has preceded each of Bitcoin’s parabolic phases by 6–10 months, suggesting a strong probability that another upward cycle is imminent. “When global M2 is rising, Bitcoin typically follows suit. This dynamic is visible across multiple cycles. In the aftermath of the 2020 COVID crisis, for instance, global M2 surged at the fastest rate in modern history. Bitcoin responded by rallying from under $10,000 to over $60,000 in just over a year. Conversely, when central banks tighten policy as they did in 2022 and 2023 to combat inflation, global M2 flattens or contracts. During this time, Bitcoin struggled. Its price declined sharply in tandem with falling liquidity, reinforcing that it is not sentiment but capital flow that drives crypto price action. As liquidity dried up, so did Bitcoin’s momentum.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-18T18:40:11,"BlackRock BUIDL Tokenization: A Strategic Boost for Crypto Collateral Adoption","BitcoinWorld BlackRock BUIDL Tokenization: A Strategic Boost for Crypto Collateral Adoption The world of finance is constantly evolving, and the intersection of traditional markets and digital assets is heating up. A significant development making waves is the integration of real-world assets (RWAs) into the crypto ecosystem. At the forefront of this trend is BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, whose move to tokenize assets is now directly impacting how institutional players engage with cryptocurrency exchanges. The recent announcement that major platforms like Crypto.com and Deribit will accept BlackRock BUIDL as collateral marks a pivotal moment, signaling growing confidence and utility for tokenized assets within the digital finance landscape. What Exactly is BlackRock BUIDL and Why Does it Matter for Institutional Crypto? BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, known as BUIDL, is a groundbreaking initiative. It’s a tokenized representation of U.S. Treasury bills and repurchase agreements, built on the Ethereum network. Think of it as a blockchain-native version of a highly stable, yield-generating traditional finance asset. Here’s a breakdown of why BUIDL is significant: Yield-Bearing: Unlike typical stablecoins or even volatile cryptocurrencies used as collateral, BUIDL offers a yield, currently around 4.5% annually (based on the underlying assets and market conditions mentioned in reports). This means the collateral itself is earning returns for the holder. Stability: Backed by U.S. Treasurys, BUIDL aims for price stability, making it a much less volatile form of collateral compared to using Bitcoin or Ethereum, which can experience significant price swings. Institutional Pedigree: Launched by BlackRock, a name synonymous with institutional finance, BUIDL carries a level of trust and familiarity that can ease the concerns of traditional institutions looking to enter or expand their presence in the crypto market. Blockchain-Native: Existing on the blockchain allows for potential benefits like faster settlement times and increased transparency compared to traditional processes, although the primary interface for institutions might still be through regulated platforms. For institutions eyeing the institutional crypto space, BUIDL offers a bridge – a regulated, familiar asset class delivered in a novel, digital format. How Does Using BlackRock BUIDL as Crypto Collateral Work? The core function of collateral in trading is to mitigate counterparty risk. When an institution wants to trade derivatives, engage in margin trading, or conduct large OTC deals on a crypto exchange, they are typically required to post collateral to cover potential losses. Traditionally, this might involve posting Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins, or even fiat currency held by the exchange or a custodian. With Crypto.com and Deribit now accepting BUIDL, institutional clients have a new option. Instead of tying up capital in non-yield-bearing or volatile assets, they can potentially use their holdings in the BlackRock BUIDL fund. Key aspects of this implementation: Target Audience: This offering is specifically aimed at institutional clients, not retail traders. These are large funds, asset managers, and proprietary trading firms. Supported Trading Types: The BUIDL collateral can be used across various trading activities offered by the exchanges, including spot trading, margin trading, derivatives (like futures and options), and over-the-counter (OTC) deals. Capital Efficiency: By using a yield-bearing asset like BUIDL as collateral, institutions can potentially improve their capital efficiency. Their collateral isn’t just sitting idle; it’s generating a return, which can offset trading costs or enhance overall profitability. Risk Management: While crypto assets are volatile, BUIDL offers relative stability due to its underlying U.S. Treasury holdings. This can simplify risk management for institutions, reducing the risk of margin calls triggered solely by the depreciation of the collateral asset itself. This move by Crypto.com and Deribit directly addresses a pain point for traditional institutions: finding suitable, regulated, and efficient forms of crypto collateral that align with their risk management frameworks. The Growing Significance of Tokenized Assets and RWA Tokenization The acceptance of BlackRock BUIDL as collateral is a powerful illustration of a much broader trend: the increasing tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). RWA tokenization involves issuing digital tokens on a blockchain that represent ownership or fractional ownership of tangible or intangible assets outside the traditional crypto space. Why is RWA tokenization gaining traction? Increased Liquidity: Tokenizing illiquid assets (like real estate, art, or private equity) can potentially make them more accessible and easier to trade. Fractional Ownership: Allows multiple investors to own a portion of a high-value asset that would otherwise be out of reach. Enhanced Transparency and Efficiency: Blockchain technology can provide clear ownership records and streamline settlement processes. New Yield Opportunities: As seen with BUIDL, tokenized versions of yield-bearing assets can bring those yields into the digital asset ecosystem. BlackRock’s foray into BUIDL is not just about creating a token; it’s about exploring how blockchain technology can be used to manage and transact traditional financial assets more effectively. The acceptance of BUIDL as tokenized assets for collateral on major exchanges validates the utility and potential of this emerging sector within crypto and TradFi. What Does This Mean for the Future of Institutional Crypto and Digital Assets? The integration of BlackRock BUIDL as collateral is more than just a feature update for Crypto.com and Deribit; it’s a strong signal about the direction of the market. It indicates a maturing ecosystem where regulated, traditional finance products are finding practical applications within the digital asset space. Implications for the future: Increased Institutional Participation: By offering familiar and stable collateral options like BUIDL, exchanges are lowering the barrier to entry for traditional financial institutions who may have been hesitant due to the volatility of native crypto assets. Demand for RWA Solutions: The success of BUIDL could spur further development and adoption of other tokenized assets representing various asset classes (e.g., private credit, real estate funds). Evolution of Crypto Collateral: We might see a shift towards more diverse and potentially more stable forms of collateral being accepted on exchanges, moving beyond just major cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. Regulatory Clarity (Gradual): While BUIDL operates within existing securities regulations, its use on crypto platforms highlights the ongoing need for clearer regulatory frameworks surrounding tokenized securities and their interaction with the crypto market. This development reinforces the narrative that the lines between traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi) are blurring, with institutional players like BlackRock playing a key role in building the necessary infrastructure and products. Considering the Benefits and Potential Challenges Let’s summarize the pros and cons of this development: Benefits: Provides a stable, yield-bearing collateral option for institutions. Enhances capital efficiency for institutional trading. Leverages the trust and reputation of BlackRock. Validates the utility and potential of RWA tokenization . Lowers barriers for traditional finance institutions entering crypto markets. Diversifies available crypto collateral options. Potential Challenges/Considerations: Accessibility is limited to institutional clients. Requires integration and infrastructure updates from exchanges and custodians. Liquidity of BUIDL itself within the crypto ecosystem needs to grow. Navigating the regulatory nuances between tokenized securities and crypto platforms. Market acceptance and understanding of tokenized traditional assets within crypto circles. Despite potential hurdles, the acceptance of BUIDL is overwhelmingly seen as a positive step for the maturation and institutional adoption of the crypto market. Actionable Insights for Market Watchers For those following the market, this development offers several key insights: Keep an eye on other major exchanges and platforms – will they follow suit and accept BUIDL or other tokenized assets as collateral? Watch for further RWA tokenization initiatives from traditional finance giants. This is likely just the beginning. Understand that institutional crypto adoption is progressing, albeit through careful, often regulated, steps like this one. The demand for stable, yield-generating assets within the crypto ecosystem is high, driving innovation in areas like BUIDL and other RWA projects. A Milestone for Crypto Collateral and Institutional Adoption The decision by Crypto.com and Deribit to accept BlackRock’s BUIDL fund as collateral is a significant milestone. It brings a highly reputable, yield-bearing, and relatively stable traditional finance asset into the heart of crypto trading infrastructure for institutional clients. This move not only validates the potential of BlackRock BUIDL and RWA tokenization but also paves a clearer path for greater institutional crypto participation by providing more familiar and efficient crypto collateral options. As the digital asset space continues to evolve, the convergence with traditional finance, led by initiatives like BUIDL, is set to reshape how institutions interact with crypto markets.

The company utilized the entirety of the net proceeds from its recent stock offering to acquire a substantial amount of Bitcoin. This action highlights a growing trend among corporations to build and maintain a dedicated Crypto Treasury as part of their long-term financial strategy. What Did BitMine Do With Its Stock Offering Proceeds? BitMine Immersion Technologies, listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), recently completed a stock offering. The goal of this offering was to raise capital, and the company has now revealed exactly how it deployed those funds. According to a press release distributed via GlobeNewswire, BitMine took the entire net proceeds from this offering, totaling $16.3 million, and converted it into Bitcoin . Specifically, the company acquired 154.17 Bitcoin. The press release stated the average purchase price for this acquisition was approximately $106,033 per BTC. This strategic allocation of capital directly into the primary asset class it operates within signals a clear commitment to Bitcoin’s future value proposition and its role within BitMine’s corporate structure. Why Build a Corporate Crypto Treasury? The concept of a corporate Crypto Treasury , primarily consisting of Bitcoin, has gained traction over the past few years. Companies opt for this strategy for various reasons, often viewing Bitcoin as a store of value, a potential hedge against inflation, or an asset with significant long-term growth potential. For a Bitcoin mining company like BitMine, holding BTC on its balance sheet aligns naturally with its core business operations and investment philosophy. Key motivations behind establishing a Crypto Treasury can include: Long-Term Value Appreciation: Belief in Bitcoin’s potential for significant price increases over time. Inflation Hedge: Positioning Bitcoin as a scarce digital asset potentially resilient to inflationary pressures affecting fiat currencies. Alignment with Business Model: For crypto-native companies like miners, holding the asset they produce is a logical extension of their operations. Shareholder Value: Potentially increasing shareholder value through the appreciation of treasury assets. BitMine explicitly stated its aim to build a long-term Bitcoin treasury, indicating this BTC purchase is not intended for short-term trading but rather as a foundational element of their balance sheet for the foreseeable future. Understanding the Stock Offering and BTC Purchase Connection The direct link between the recent Stock Offering and the BTC purchase is crucial to understanding BitMine’s financial maneuvering. A stock offering is a way for a company to raise funds by selling shares of its stock to the public. In this case, BitMine successfully raised capital through this method, and instead of using the funds solely for operational expansion or debt reduction (though these might also be goals), they chose to dedicate the entire net proceeds specifically to acquiring Bitcoin. This move demonstrates a high level of confidence in Bitcoin as an asset class. It’s not just using existing cash reserves, but actively raising external capital through traditional financial markets (NYSE) and immediately deploying it into the cryptocurrency market. This strategy could be seen as leveraging traditional finance to strengthen their position in the digital asset space. Key points about this connection: The stock offering provided the necessary capital ($16.3M net). 100% of these net funds were allocated to the BTC purchase . This links traditional equity markets directly to cryptocurrency investment for the company. BitMine’s Strategic Position After the BTC Purchase Following this substantial BTC purchase , BitMine Immersion Technologies is now positioned with a significant corporate Crypto Treasury . This treasury size, holding over 154 Bitcoin, places them among other public companies that hold digital assets on their balance sheet, albeit the size relative to market cap varies significantly across companies. For a Bitcoin mining company, accumulating BTC is often seen as a core part of its strategy, allowing it to benefit not only from the mining process but also from the potential appreciation of the asset it mines. By using the Stock Offering funds for this purpose, BitMine has effectively converted external investment into direct exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements, in addition to their operational exposure through mining. This strategic decision reflects management’s view on the future trajectory of Bitcoin and their commitment to accumulating the asset during what they presumably see as an opportune time, even at an average price point of $106,033 as stated in the press release. What Does This Mean for BitMine and Investors? For BitMine, this move solidifies its balance sheet with a significant digital asset holding. The value of this treasury will fluctuate directly with the price of Bitcoin , introducing a new dynamic to the company’s financial performance beyond just mining efficiency and operational costs. A rising Bitcoin price would positively impact their treasury value, while a falling price would have the opposite effect. For investors, this transparency about using Stock Offering funds for a direct BTC purchase provides clarity on the company’s capital allocation strategy. Investors are now directly exposed to BitMine’s operational performance *and* its strategic treasury management. Companies pursuing a Crypto Treasury strategy often appeal to investors who are bullish on Bitcoin itself and want exposure through publicly traded equities. In conclusion, BitMine Immersion Technologies’ decision to deploy the full $16.3 million from its recent stock offering into purchasing 154.17 Bitcoin is a bold statement of intent. It underscores the company’s commitment to building a long-term Crypto Treasury and leverages traditional financial mechanisms to strengthen its position within the digital asset ecosystem. This strategic BTC purchase , funded entirely by the Stock Offering , positions BitMine with significant direct exposure to Bitcoin’s future performance, adding a new dimension to its financial profile and investment appeal.

""Although swings in net exports have affected the data, recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace,"" the press release said. ""The unemployment rate remains low, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated."" The Fed's quarterly economic projections—which include the ""dot plot"" that indicates where the central bank expects the Fed funds rate over time — showed that policymakers see rates at 3.9% by year-end 2025, translating to 50 basis point cuts this year, the same as they expected in March. However, Fed members see rates decline to 3.6% next year and 3.4% in 2027, indicating fewer rate cuts than their previous projection. Policymakers also cut their economic growth projections, with the GDP increase this year now seen at 1.4% versus 1.7% at the March forecast. They also projected higher inflation for this year, with Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) and core PCE inflation landing at 3% and 3.1%, versus 2.7% and 2.8% in March. Fed members also see the unemployment rate rising to 4.5% this year and during 2026, up from 4.4% and 4.3% March projections.

2025-06-18T18:13:27,"Bitcoin price steady as Fed keeps interest rates stable","The Federal Reserve has decided to keep interest rates at current levels, maintaining a cautious stance on inflation. A strong labor market, steady growth, and somewhat elevated inflation prompted the Fed to hold rates steady. On Wednesday, June 18, the Federal Open Market Committee announced it would maintain rates in the 4.25% to 4.5% range, in line with market expectations. The FOMC noted that future rate decisions will remain data-dependent. Bitcoin (BTC) remained resilient ahead of the Fed decision, recovering some earlier losses. BTC was trading at $104,364, up 0.43% over the past 24 hours, while the total crypto market cap rose 0.22% to $3.23 trillion. The Fed’s decision came amid growing tensions in the Israel-Iran conflict, which is fueling macroeconomic uncertainty. Rising oil prices could reignite inflationary pressures, which have shown signs of easing in recent months. Due to this uncertainty, the market consensus was that the Fed would keep the rates stable. A CME Group’s poll showed a likelihood of 99.9% that the Fed would maintain rates, despite ongoing pressures from the White House. Trump continues to pressure the Fed On the same day, U.S. President Donald Trump stated that “stupid” Fed Chair Jerome Powell will likely keep the rates at their current levels. The remarks were part of ongoing attacks on the Fed, with Trump urging them to lower rates by 2 points. “So we have a stupid person. Frankly, you probably won’t cut today,” Trump said. “Europe had 10 cuts, and we had none. And I guess he’s a political guy, I don’t know. He’s a political guy who’s not a smart person, but he’s costing the country a fortune.” Trump argues that lower rates would stimulate economic activity and boost the stock market. However, the Fed has continued to prioritize inflation control and has so far resisted political pressure, especially amid lingering inflationary risks, partially driven by the tariff regime introduced under Trump’s own administration.

Baylina retains a founder’s title, but his team and codebase are now fully independent. On June 18, Polygon co-founder Jordi Baylina took to X to announce that he and the core zkEVM development team have spun out to form Zisk, an independent project focused on advancing low-latency, open-source zero-knowledge virtual machine technology. All intellectual property tied to the effort, including codebases developed under Polygon’s umbrella, has been transferred to SilentSig GmbH, a Swiss entity wholly owned by Baylina. According to Zisk’s website, the team had been incubating the project within Polygon since May 2024, before formalizing the carve-out on June 13. You might also like: Here’s why Polygon price is at risk of a 25% plunge The Zisk gambit: how Polygon’s zkEVM exodus could reshape zero-knowledge tech Baylina’s spinout comes just a week after a major leadership shakeup at Polygon, with co-founder Sandeep Nailwal taking direct control of the Polygon Foundation. Following his appointment, Nailwal quickly introduced a new roadmap that sidelined the zero-knowledge EVM in favor of Polygon PoS and its AggLayer interoperability protocol. The decision effectively shuttered a project that had been burning over $1 million annually. Blockchain researcher Lorenz Lehmann noted on X that Polygon had “quietly abandoned” development, despite investing nine figures into the initiative. Soon Polygon zkEVM will shut down. Quick recap: >Polygon acquired Hermez for $250M in 2021 >Rebranded to Polygon zkEVM >Development quietly abandoned >Never upgraded to use Blobs, chain runs at 1M$+ loss/y >Announce chain will shut down https://t.co/paYx0P06oi pic.twitter.com/0uJAPSvOFX — Lorenz Lehmann (@LehmannLorenz) June 16, 2025 For Baylina and his team, the writing was on the wall. Rather than resist the shift, they opted to forge a new path. With Zisk, Baylina aims to eliminate the overhead of legacy architecture and focus on delivering the core promise of what zkEVM aspired to be but never fully achieved. While current zkVMs like Polygon zkEVM emphasize EVM compatibility, Zisk’s architecture prioritizes low-latency proofs, a critical requirement for real-world use cases such as decentralized exchanges and gaming. Early benchmarks suggest Zisk’s approach could reduce verification times by 40–60% compared to incumbent solutions, though independent audits will be required to verify those claims. The spinout also inherits Polygon zkEVM’s open-source legacy, with Baylina pledging to keep Zisk’s codebase permissionless.

2025-06-18T18:10:11,"Bitcoin Investment Strategy: Accumulator Shockingly Outperforms DCA Since 2023","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Investment Strategy: Accumulator Shockingly Outperforms DCA Since 2023 When it comes to navigating the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, particularly market leader Bitcoin, investors often look for reliable strategies to build their holdings over time. The Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) method is perhaps the most widely known and adopted Bitcoin investment strategy , praised for its simplicity and ability to reduce timing risk. However, recent analysis from institutional liquidity provider Orbit Markets has thrown a fascinating curveball, suggesting that another approach – the accumulator strategy – has significantly outperformed DCA for Bitcoin investors since the beginning of 2023. This finding from the Orbit Markets analysis challenges conventional wisdom and warrants a closer look for anyone serious about crypto investment . Understanding the Accumulator Strategy and DCA Bitcoin Before diving into the performance comparison, let’s quickly recap what these two strategies entail: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): This is a straightforward approach where an investor invests a fixed amount of money at regular intervals (e.g., $100 every week) regardless of the asset’s price. The idea is that you buy more shares (or Bitcoin) when the price is low and fewer when the price is high, averaging out your purchase cost over time. It removes emotion from investing and is easy to automate. It’s a popular DCA Bitcoin method for beginners and long-term holders. Accumulator Strategy: This is a more active strategy, often used in traditional finance for accumulating assets at favorable prices. In the context of Bitcoin, it typically involves setting a target price below the current market price to buy Bitcoin at a discount. If the price falls further, the investor commits to buying even more, often in increasing increments. The goal is to lower the average purchase price by aggressively buying dips. It requires more monitoring and a willingness to increase exposure during downturns. This is the core of the Accumulator strategy . Orbit Markets Analysis: Why Accumulator Pulled Ahead Since 2023 According to the analysis conducted by Orbit Markets, the accumulator strategy demonstrated a clear performance edge over the traditional DCA approach when applied to Bitcoin investments made since January 1, 2023. This specific timeframe is crucial, as it covers a significant period of recovery and growth for the Bitcoin market following the bear market lows of 2022. The key findings highlighted by Orbit Markets are compelling: Over a three-month period, the accumulator strategy delivered approximately 10% higher returns compared to DCA. Extending the timeframe to 12 months, the outperformance became even more pronounced, with the accumulator strategy yielding up to 26% greater returns than DCA. So, why did the Accumulator strategy Bitcoin approach perform so much better during this period? The Orbit Markets analysis suggests that DCA was less effective, particularly during bull runs. While DCA steadily buys through all market conditions, including rallies, the accumulator strategy is designed to capitalize on price dips. The period since early 2023, while generally bullish, has seen notable price corrections and volatility. The accumulator strategy, by specifically targeting these dips and increasing purchase size as prices fell, was able to acquire Bitcoin at lower average prices than a fixed-interval DCA plan. Imagine the market movement since 2023: Bitcoin started recovering, had significant upward moves, but also experienced sharp pullbacks. A DCA investor bought consistently every week or month, buying through highs and lows. An accumulator investor, however, might have set buy orders below the market price, accumulating more Bitcoin during those price drops. When the market subsequently rebounded, the accumulator investor held a larger position acquired at a lower average cost, leading to superior returns. Benefits and Challenges of Each Crypto Investment Strategy Understanding the pros and cons is vital when choosing a Bitcoin investment strategy : Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) – The Steady Hand: Benefits: Simplicity: Easy to understand and implement, even for beginners. Reduces Timing Risk: Eliminates the need to predict market movements. You buy regardless of price. Emotional Control: Automating investments removes impulsive decisions driven by fear or greed. Accessibility: Many platforms offer automated DCA features for DCA Bitcoin . Challenges: May Miss Optimal Entries: Doesn’t specifically capitalize on significant price dips. Potential Underperformance in Strong Bull Runs: As the Orbit Markets analysis noted, it can be less effective than strategies designed to leverage volatility in certain market phases. Averages Up in Sustained Rallies: You keep buying at higher prices during a continuous upward trend. Accumulator Strategy – The Opportunist: Benefits: Potential for Higher Returns: As shown by the Orbit Markets analysis since 2023, it can significantly outperform in markets with dips within an overall uptrend. Lower Average Cost: Designed to acquire assets at discounted prices by buying dips. Leverages Volatility: Thrives in markets that move up but experience pullbacks. Challenges: Requires Active Management: Needs monitoring and setting/adjusting buy orders. Increased Risk in Downtrends: If the price keeps falling without significant rebounds, you keep buying more, potentially leading to larger losses than DCA. Emotional Challenge: Buying more as the price falls can be psychologically difficult. Complexity: More complex to set up and manage than simple DCA. Execution Risk: Orders might not fill if the price doesn’t hit your target. Is the Accumulator Strategy Right for Your Crypto Investment? The findings from the Orbit Markets analysis are compelling, but they don’t necessarily mean everyone should abandon DCA Bitcoin for the accumulator strategy immediately. The best crypto investment approach depends heavily on individual circumstances, risk tolerance, time commitment, and market outlook. Here are some factors to consider: Risk Tolerance: The accumulator strategy is inherently riskier than DCA, especially in a sustained bear market. Are you comfortable increasing your exposure as prices fall? Time Commitment: DCA is largely automated. The accumulator requires more active monitoring and management of limit orders. Do you have the time and willingness for this? Market Outlook: The accumulator performed well since 2023 because there were dips to buy within an overall bullish trend. Would it perform as well in a prolonged, severe bear market where prices simply continue to fall? Likely not. Capital Availability: The accumulator strategy often implies having capital ready to deploy when dips occur, which might be different from the fixed schedule of DCA. For many investors, especially those new to the space or preferring a hands-off approach, DCA Bitcoin remains a robust and sensible long-term Bitcoin investment strategy . It removes emotion and ensures participation in market growth over time, even if it might not capture the absolute best entry points during volatile periods. However, for investors with a higher risk tolerance, more experience, and the time to actively manage their positions, the accumulator strategy, particularly informed by insights like the Orbit Markets analysis , could be a powerful tool to potentially enhance returns by strategically buying dips. Some investors might even consider a hybrid approach, combining elements of both. Conclusion: Beyond DCA for Enhanced Returns? The analysis from Orbit Markets provides valuable insight, highlighting that for the specific market conditions experienced since 2023, the accumulator strategy significantly outperformed the popular DCA method for Bitcoin investors, delivering substantially higher returns over 3 and 12 months. This finding underscores that while DCA is a solid foundation for a crypto investment plan, exploring and understanding alternative strategies like the Accumulator strategy can potentially lead to enhanced performance, especially in volatile markets. Ultimately, the choice of Bitcoin investment strategy should align with your personal financial goals, risk profile, and market understanding. The Orbit Markets analysis serves as a reminder that staying informed about different approaches and their performance under varying market conditions is key to making educated investment decisions in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency.

The Israeli hacking group Predatory Sparrow is claiming responsibility for the cyberattack against Iran’s Bank Sepah that has left customers unable to access their funds, reports Axios. Local Iranian news has reported that customers’ cards are completely unusable, the mobile app and digital services are down, and most ATMs are out of cash. Said one man in Tehran, the country’s capital, “I’ve visited ten ATMs today… None had any cash.” The hacker group, which publicly goes by the Farsi translation of its name, Gonjeshke Darande, says on the social media platform X that it deleted the state-owned banking system’s data. “Bank Sepah was an institution that circumvented international sanctions and used the people of Iran’s money to finance the regime’s terrorist proxies, its ballistic missile program and its military nuclear program. This is what happens to institutions dedicated to maintaining the dictator’s terrorist fantasies.” Bank Sepah has not responded to the incident at time of writing. Axios says it was unable to immediately verify the hackers’ claims. The same Israeli hacker group is also claiming responsibility for an attack on the Iranian crypto exchange Nobitex. On-chain investigator ZachXBT says in a Telegram post that the hackers appear to have stolen at least $81.7 million in digital assets from the platform. “The Iranian crypto exchange ‘Nobitex’ appears to have been exploited for $81.7M on Tron, Bitcoin, Doge, and EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) chains after suspicious outflows were observed from many wallets linked to them… The funds were essentially burned permanently and cannot be touched unless stablecoin issuers were to reissue the centralized stablecoins.” In a post on the social media platform X, Nobitex has confirmed that a security breach occurred. “Immediately upon detection, all access was suspended and our internal security teams are closely investigating the extent of the incident. We would like to remind you that users’ assets are completely secure according to cold storage standards, and the above incident only affected a portion of the assets in hot wallets. Nobitex accepts full responsibility for this incident and assures users that all damages will be compensated through the insurance fund and Nobitex resources.

The FED kept interest rates steady. Market expectations were that the institution would keep its policy rate steady. However, economic indicators and political uncertainties make it necessary to give clearer messages about the coming period. The Fed has held interest rates steady at around 4.4% since January. Officials have been cautious about cutting rates, saying they want to see the impact of tariffs and other major economic policies implemented by President Donald Trump. Economists expect the FED to cut interest rates this year. According to this forecast, the most important factor triggering interest rate cuts will be the increase in unemployment.

On the other hand, the analyst also raised the possibility of Bitcoin dropping below $100,000, with the flagship crypto reaching $95,000. Bitcoin Weekly Chikou Span Indicates Uptrend, But BTC Price Still At Risk In an X post , Tony Severino highlighted the Bitcoin weekly Chikou, which he suggested paints a bullish picture for the BTC price. He noted that this pattern held a retest of support at the candlesticks, with little to no overhead resistance left. Meanwhile, the Tenkan-sen and Kijun-sen just crossed bullish. The technical expert remarked that the Kijun-sen is still trending sideways. However, he added that the BTC price is above both spans, which he claimed is bullish for Bitcoin. Overall, Severino opined that the weekly leans bullish for the flagship crypto. Meanwhile, he noted that this same picture leaves room for a drop to $95,000 this week, meaning anything can still happen. The BTC price action has been highly volatile over the last few days, thanks to the Israel-Iran tensions . Bitcoin dropped to as low as $103,000 on June 17 amid reports that the US was considering joining Israel to attack Iran. The US potentially joining Israel could further escalate tensions and spread more panic in the market, sending BTC spiraling. The BTC price is also on edge ahead of the FOMC meeting today. CME FedWatch data shows that there is a 99.9% chance that the Fed will keep interest rates unchanged. However, market participants are looking forward to Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech to get a hint of whether there will be rate cuts later in the year. The war in the Middle East is driving oil prices higher, which could lead to inflation rising again and potentially delaying a rate cut. BTC Needs To Hold Above $104,000 In an X post , crypto analyst Titan of Crypto indicated that the BTC price needs to hold above the major support at $104,149 for a potential bounce back. This came as part of his analysis, in which he revealed that Bitcoin has landed on a key Ichimoku support . The analyst stated that BTC is now testing the Kumo cloud and that its thickness suggests strong support. Crypto analyst Kevin Capital has warned market participants to remain cautious as long as the BTC price remains below $106,800 on the 3-day and weekly closes.

2025-06-18T18:00:11,"Shiba Inu Payment Breakthrough: Amore Smiles Now Accepts SHIB, BTC, ETH","BitcoinWorld Shiba Inu Payment Breakthrough: Amore Smiles Now Accepts SHIB, BTC, ETH In a move signaling the growing integration of digital assets into traditional commerce, Michigan-based dental supply company Amore Smiles has announced it will now accept crypto payments for its products. This isn’t just about adding another payment option; it’s a step that embraces the future of finance and potentially expands their reach in the global market. What Does This Mean for **Accept Crypto Payments**? The decision by Amore Smiles to accept crypto payments highlights a significant trend we’re seeing across various industries. While early adopters were often tech companies or online retailers, we are increasingly seeing businesses rooted in more traditional sectors, like healthcare supply, recognize the potential of digital currencies. This isn’t just about Bitcoin or Ethereum anymore; the inclusion of Shiba Inu, a cryptocurrency that started with a meme, shows a broader acceptance of the diverse crypto landscape. For businesses considering accepting crypto, Amore Smiles provides a compelling example. They operate globally, exporting to over 200 countries, which means they understand the complexities of international transactions. Adding crypto can potentially streamline these processes, reduce fees, and open doors to customers in regions where traditional payment methods might be less accessible or more expensive. This move contributes to the overall legitimacy and adoption of cryptocurrencies as viable forms of payment. Every business, large or small, that decides to accept crypto payments helps build the infrastructure and user confidence needed for wider adoption. Why **Shiba Inu Payment**? The Community’s Role Perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of Amore Smiles’ announcement is the inclusion of Shiba Inu (SHIB) alongside established giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The rise of SHIB has been phenomenal, driven largely by its passionate and active community. Accepting a Shiba Inu payment is more than just adding a token; it’s tapping into this vibrant community base. While initially seen as a meme coin, SHIB has been working to build utility within its ecosystem, including decentralized exchanges and layer-2 scaling solutions. Businesses accepting SHIB payments are betting on the continued growth and loyalty of the Shib Army. For a company like Amore Smiles, offering a Shiba Inu payment option could attract customers specifically interested in using their SHIB holdings for real-world goods and services, potentially creating a new customer segment. It also sends a message that Amore Smiles is forward-thinking and willing to embrace newer, community-driven digital assets, not just the market leaders. This can generate significant positive buzz within the crypto community. The Bedrock: **Bitcoin Payment** and **Ethereum Payment** in Commerce While SHIB’s inclusion is noteworthy, the acceptance of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) provides a solid foundation for Amore Smiles’ crypto payment options. A Bitcoin payment is arguably the most recognized form of cryptocurrency transaction globally. Bitcoin’s status as the first and largest cryptocurrency by market cap makes it a natural choice for any business looking to accept digital assets. Bitcoin offers a decentralized, secure, and relatively fast way to transfer value across borders without intermediaries. For a company exporting to 200+ countries, this is a significant advantage. A Bitcoin payment can bypass traditional banking hours and international transfer delays, potentially speeding up order processing and delivery. Similarly, an Ethereum payment leverages the second-largest cryptocurrency ecosystem. While Ethereum is perhaps best known for its smart contract capabilities, DeFi, and NFTs, ETH is also a widely held and accepted digital currency for payments. Ethereum’s ongoing evolution, particularly its move to Proof-of-Stake, aims to make transactions faster and more energy-efficient, further enhancing its viability as a payment method. Offering both a Bitcoin payment and an Ethereum payment covers the two most prominent and liquid cryptocurrencies, catering to a large segment of the crypto-holding population. This dual approach, combined with SHIB, offers customers significant flexibility. Amore Smiles: A **Business Accepting Crypto** on a Global Scale Amore Smiles’ decision positions them as an early adopter within the dental supply sector. Becoming a business accepting crypto when your peers may not be can create a competitive edge. By facilitating payments in SHIB, BTC, and ETH, they are lowering potential barriers for international customers who may find it easier or cheaper to pay with crypto than through traditional banking channels or credit cards. Think about a dental clinic in a country with high transaction fees for international wires or limited access to certain payment processors. If they can make a Shiba Inu payment , a Bitcoin payment , or an Ethereum payment directly to Amore Smiles, it simplifies their procurement process. This global reach makes Amore Smiles’ move particularly impactful. For any business accepting crypto , especially one operating internationally, integrating a reliable payment gateway is crucial. These services handle the complexities of converting crypto to fiat (if desired), managing wallets, and ensuring secure transactions, often providing plugins for e-commerce platforms. Beyond the Transaction: Amore Smiles and Blockchain for Secure Data The Watcher Guru report also mentions Amore Smiles leveraging blockchain technology for secure data storage. This is a key point that goes beyond just accepting payments. Blockchain’s inherent properties of immutability, transparency (where appropriate), and decentralization make it ideal for securing sensitive information. In the dental supply industry, data could include order histories, shipping manifests, product authenticity records, or even potentially (with proper privacy considerations) information related to product usage or regulatory compliance. Using blockchain for secure data storage can enhance trust, provide an unalterable audit trail, and protect against data tampering. This demonstrates that Amore Smiles isn’t just dabbling in crypto payments as a gimmick; they appear to be exploring the broader potential of blockchain technology to improve their operations and security. This holistic approach strengthens their position as an innovative business accepting crypto . The Upside: Benefits for Businesses **Accepting Crypto** Why are more businesses, like Amore Smiles, choosing to accept crypto payments ? The benefits are numerous and compelling: Expanded Customer Base: Access to a global market of crypto holders, including those who prefer using digital assets or have limited access to traditional banking.

Reach Underserved Markets: Serve customers in regions with less developed financial infrastructure. Navigating the Waters: Challenges of **Business Accepting Crypto** While the benefits are clear, becoming a business accepting crypto is not without its challenges. Amore Smiles, like any adopter, would need to consider these factors: Price Volatility: The value of cryptocurrencies can fluctuate dramatically, potentially impacting the fiat value received unless immediately converted. Regulatory Uncertainty: The legal and regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving in many countries. Tax Implications: Handling crypto can introduce complex tax reporting requirements depending on jurisdiction and how assets are managed (held vs. immediately converted). Technical Complexity: Setting up wallets, integrating payment gateways, and managing transactions requires technical understanding. Security Risks: Wallets can be targeted by hackers, and lost private keys can result in irreversible loss of funds. Customer Education: Some customers may be new to using crypto for payments and might require guidance. Integration: Integrating crypto payment systems with existing accounting and inventory software can be challenging. Making the Leap: Actionable Insights for Your **Business Accepting Crypto** Inspired by Amore Smiles? Here are some steps for other businesses considering accepting crypto: Research: Understand cryptocurrencies, blockchain, and how they apply to your business model. Choose Your Cryptos: Decide which cryptocurrencies to accept based on customer demand, market liquidity, and transaction costs (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins, potentially others like SHIB). Select a Payment Processor: Services like BitPay, Coinbase Commerce, or others can simplify the process, handle conversions, and manage wallets securely. Understand the Tech: Get familiar with wallets, transaction confirmations, and security best practices. Address Taxes and Regulation: Consult with tax professionals and legal experts to understand your obligations. Educate Your Team: Ensure staff who interact with customers or handle finances understand the new payment option. Communicate with Customers: Clearly explain that you accept crypto and how customers can use it. Start Small (Optional): You might consider rolling out crypto payments gradually or for specific products/services first. The Road Ahead: Future of Crypto in Commerce The move by Amore Smiles is likely just one of many we will see in the coming years. As cryptocurrencies become more mainstream, payment solutions become more user-friendly, and regulatory clarity improves, more businesses will explore accepting digital assets. We might see even wider acceptance of a diverse range of tokens, including community-driven ones like SHIB, alongside the established players. The potential for faster, cheaper, and more inclusive global commerce powered by crypto is immense. Conclusion Amore Smiles’ decision to accept Shiba Inu, Bitcoin, and Ethereum for its dental supplies is a significant step, not just for the company, but for the broader adoption of cryptocurrencies in traditional industries. By embracing digital payments and leveraging blockchain for secure data, they are positioning themselves at the forefront of innovation in the dental supply sector.

The U.K. is looking to formulate rules that are more on the restrictive side, said David Bailey, the executive director of prudential policy at the Bank of England, in a speech at Risk Live Europe in London. Bailey suggested the country is likely to encourage banks to have a low exposure to crypto. ""There are also examples where it might be more appropriate to start more towards the restrictive end of the spectrum, while evidence is gathered to see if standards can be relaxed over time,"" Bailey said. ""The prudential treatment of banks’ exposures to cryptoassets, and specifically those with features associated with heightened price volatility and where investors could lose the entirety of their investment, is an example in this space."" The nation is seeking to implement the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's disclosure framework for banks' exposure to crypto. This framework must be put in place by the start of 2026 to help nations evaluate risks, the committee said. The Committee also proposed rules that banks should limit exposure to crypto like bitcoin to 1%. The U.K.'s plans will be ""informed"" by the standards developed by the Basel Committee, Bailey said. Nations have been looking to ensure they can maintain financial stability despite crypto volatility by monitoring how interlinked banks are to crypto, especially following the 2023 collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Silvergate Bank which both had crypto clients. The U.K.'s prudential crypto rules will come at a time where the country's other financial regulator — the Financial Conduct Authority — is set to implement a new regime for crypto.

2025-06-18T17:52:14,"Interview | HIVE CFO: Hydro-cooled mining and AI cloud give us an edge post-halving","As Bitcoin mining enters a new chapter post-halving, HIVE Digital Technologies is taking a measured, ambitious approach to growth. In this interview, Darcy Daubaras, CFO of HIVE, offers an inside look at how the company plans to scale its hashrate to 25 EH/s by the end of 2025 while sticking to its no-debt philosophy and keeping a close eye on operational discipline. Daubaras explains how HIVE is balancing speed with sustainability. It is interesting to note that HIVE’s story isn’t just about mining . The company has also made an early move into AI and high-performance cloud services, using its green data centers to diversify beyond crypto and build long-term resilience. Daubaras explains how this dual focus between Bitcoin ( BTC ) and computing gives HIVE a competitive edge, especially as ESG concerns and energy costs dictate the winners and losers in the mining industry. For investors and industry watchers, it’s a rare glimpse into how one of the sector’s most forward-thinking firms is positioning itself for the future. Below is the complete Q&A with Darcy Daubaras. crypto.news: HIVE is undertaking a massive hashrate expansion with the goal of 25 EH/s by late 2025. You already hit 10 EH/s as of May. Your goal still represents a further increase of around 2.5x in capacity. What are the biggest execution risks in scaling up this rapidly, and how are you managing these challenges to ensure you meet your 25 EH/s goal on time? DD: Scaling to 25 EH/s is an ambitious objective, but we are firmly on track. However, rapid expansion at this scale naturally introduces execution risks, including global supply chain volatility, hardware logistics, and tight construction timelines. We actively manage these risks through a combination of disciplined project planning, phased deployments, and strong local execution. Our partnerships with trusted vendors and our local presence at each site provide us with critical visibility and control at every stage of the buildout. In Paraguay, for instance, our operations are led by Country President Gabriel Lamas, a seasoned electrical engineer with over two decades of experience in large-scale infrastructure and energy projects throughout Latin America. Under his guidance, we are constructing high-performance, hydro-powered data centres designed for long-term reliability, grid efficiency, and sustainability. His deep understanding of energy systems ensures that as we scale in South America, we are not just growing quickly, but with precision and resilience. CN: Are there any financing challenges to scaling your operation, considering your ‘no debt’ stance? Will you deploy more of your Bitcoin treasury or raise capital if needed, or can HIVE continue working towards its goals through operational cash flow? Speaking of which, how do you decide when to hold mined BTC versus when to liquidate or use it for corporate needs? DD: Using Bitcoin from our treasury to fund growth gives us flexibility without incurring debt; however, it requires disciplined timing and robust treasury management. Given Bitcoin’s historical volatility, we are cautious to structure transactions that provide downside protection and potential buybacks. We only deploy BTC when it presents clear, accretive growth. Our goal is always to safeguard long-term upside while responsibly funding accretive expansion. CN: HIVE has aggressively invested in next-gen mining hardware, such as the S21+ Hydro ASICs for your fleet. I’m not going to pretend to understand what is happening ‘under the hood’, but perhaps you can explain how these state-of-the-art, hydro-cooled machines give HIVE an edge over competitors in terms of performance or unit economics? Are these tools sufficient for your needs out of the box or do you need to explore further in-house optimization to improve efficiency and hash rate density? DD: The S21+ Hydro ASICs represent a major leap forward in mining efficiency, and we’ve made a deliberate bet on this technology as a cornerstone of our next growth phase. Hydro-cooled ASIC miners are environmentally responsible due to their superior energy efficiency and reduced environmental impact. Liquid cooling requires less energy than traditional air systems, lowering total site power consumption and improving power usage effectiveness.. These systems also eliminate high-speed fans, cutting noise pollution and making them more suitable for community integration. The stable thermal environment extends equipment life, reducing electronic waste. Additionally, hydro-cooled setups are often paired with renewable energy sources like hydropower, further minimizing carbon footprint. Together, these factors make hydro-cooled miners a more sustainable choice for responsible Bitcoin mining operations. At HIVE, we see hardware as just one part of the equation. It’s how you deploy, tune, and manage that hardware, especially at scale, that really sets leaders apart. As such, we’ve developed proprietary firmware optimizations that fine-tune voltage and frequency settings to push performance beyond factory specifications while maintaining energy efficiency. CN: HIVE reported an approximate 35% gross operating margin in fiscal 2024. However, since the 2024 halving, industry economics have obviously tightened while network difficulty is at an all-time high. With that said, what margin profile do you expect for HIVE in the coming quarters or full fiscal year? DD: Sustainability throughout all market cycles is a core aspect of our strategy. At a Bitcoin price of $120K, our gross mining margin is roughly 65%, with a breakeven hash price close to $20. Nevertheless, we operate with one of the most streamlined teams in the industry, maintain the lowest G&A expenses among our peers, and are highly disciplined in our capital allocation. This efficiency keeps our cost structure competitive, enabling us to stay profitable even if Bitcoin falls below $100K. CN: How does your diversification into GPU cloud services or AI computing complement your core Bitcoin mining business, or is this just a natural expansion? Do you envision HIVE’s green data centers eventually servicing a larger share of AI, machine learning, or other cloud workloads as a hedge against crypto cycles, and can this become a significant revenue stream or competitive advantage for HIVE in the long run? DD: Our entry into HPC and AI cloud services isn’t a pivot. In fact, HIVE was the first Bitcoin miner to launch an AI strategy, seizing the opportunity right after Ethereum transitioned to proof-of-stake. We repurposed our GPU infrastructure early and deliberately, offering high-performance, sovereign AI compute to enterprises, research institutions, and other mission-critical users. That foresight is paying off as BUZZ HPC is already reaching revenue milestones ahead of schedule. As AI and data centre infrastructure increasingly become national security priorities, we see enormous tailwinds driving demand for trusted, green compute. This is also smart risk management. When crypto markets soften, AI compute demand remains robust. Over time, we expect our green data centres to power both the blockchain and AI economies. That dual engine gives HIVE a sustainable competitive advantage and a pathway to long-term, diversified revenue growth. CN: How are you preparing for potential downturns or unexpected shocks in the Bitcoin market? Do you utilize any hedging strategies to protect against price swings, or is HIVE essentially fully exposed to Bitcoin with confidence that low costs and a strong balance sheet will carry you through any bear market? Or, do you just HODL and hope for the best? DD: Our belief in the long-term value of the Bitcoin network is central to our strategy. However, we manage risk through structural advantages such as minimal debt, low operating costs, and flexible treasury management. Our fleet is designed to endure downturns with discipline. We may monetize BTC when it facilitates accretive growth, but we’re not forced sellers. Our philosophy is straightforward: strong balance sheet, efficient operations, and long-term conviction. CN: The Bitcoin mining sector as a whole is under increasing ESG scrutiny from regulators, environmental groups, and even investors concerned about energy consumption and carbon emissions. We’ve seen some jurisdictions consider moratoriums or bans on mining (Paraguay’s debate being one example), and miners are now keen to prove their climate credentials. In your view, is the industry doing enough to address these concerns? How is HIVE contributing to improving the narrative around Bitcoin mining’s environmental impact? DD: The ESG debate in mining is valid, but it often lacks nuance. HIVE has always been a renewable-first miner. Since our inception, we’ve prioritized green energy in Iceland, Sweden, Canada, and now Paraguay. We believe the industry must lead with transparency, accurate emissions data, and proactive grid integration. We’re also working to shift the narrative: Bitcoin mining can provide a net benefit to energy systems by stabilizing grids, monetizing stranded power, and supporting local communities. At HIVE, we support that claim with action and investment. CN: Do you anticipate a shakeout ahead, where higher-cost or over-leveraged miners struggle and network growth slows? How does a company like HIVE position itself in this scenario? Are you preparing to capture market share from potential drop-outs, or even to acquire assets/equipment from distressed miners? DD: A shakeout is not only likely, but also healthy. The post-halving landscape has separated efficient operators from the rest, and HIVE is uniquely positioned to benefit. We run lean, avoid leverage, and operate at scale using renewable power. If distressed assets enter the market, we’ll be opportunistic, but only if they meet our stringent ROI and ESG criteria. This is a cycle where resilience prevails, and that’s where we’ve focused our strategy. CN: How does HIVE approach site selection and energy procurement? With your large Paraguay hydro projects, it seems you’ve locked in relatively low-cost, renewable power. Are you looking at other geographies with cheap power for future expansion, or do you feel your current mix already provides a competitive enough energy cost profile? DD: Energy is crucial in mining, and we’re precise in how we assess jurisdictions. We seek low-cost renewable energy, regulatory stability, and grid reliability. Paraguay meets all these criteria and more, which is why it’s now a key part of our global fleet. However, we’re not pausing here. We’re actively investigating further opportunities, as diversification aids us in mitigating geopolitical and operational risks while securing low-cost energy for the long term. CN: Curious as a follow-up from the previous question, if Paraguay is such an ideal location for your operation, why not base 100% of your operation there? What exactly is the benefit of geographical diversification? DD: Paraguay is politically stable and offers abundant hydropower, which is why we chose to invest there. However, like any jurisdiction, risks exist. These include regulatory changes, limitations in grid infrastructure, and regional trade dynamics. We have built strong relationships with the government and work closely with local utilities to ensure alignment. By investing in grid upgrades and developing local talent, we are helping to build long-term resilience into our operations. Nonetheless, our goal is global resilience; while Paraguay is our flagship, our operational playbook remains multi-site and multi-country. CN: Some investors see (Micro)Strategy primarily as a proxy for Bitcoin exposure rather than a software company. Given that HIVE also holds BTC on its balance sheet and now runs data centers and HPC operations, how do you want investors to view HIVE? Are you basically one part miner, one part digital asset infrastructure play, or a de facto Bitcoin ETF? Do you feel the need to market yourself as a more balanced alternative to Strategy’s ‘infinite money glitch’ reputation? DD: HIVE is a new breed of Bitcoin infrastructure company. Long before the latest wave of corporate Bitcoin adopters, HIVE became the first public company to hold BTC on its balance sheet. In many respects, we helped define the Bitcoin treasury model. However, we’re not merely a hashrate story or a BTC proxy. We’re building renewable-powered digital infrastructure with two distinct, complementary monetization layers: Bitcoin mining and high-performance computing. Consider us as a green data centre business operating at the intersection of blockchain and AI. Unlike companies focusing on short-term quarters, HIVE is dedicated to building sustainable infrastructure for decades to come. We’re creating long-term financial and digital sovereignty while providing investors with diversified exposure to both decentralized networks and the compute layer powering the next generation of innovation. CN: Do you think there’s any room for strategic collaboration (or outright acquisitions) between mining firms and treasury-heavy companies like Strategy? Have you been approached by Strategy for any discussions? Or are you too fundamentally different on opposite sides of the Bitcoin ecosystem to create any synergies? DD: We respect what Strategy has built as a treasury-focused BTC vehicle, but our models are fundamentally different. As a traditional Bitcoin miner, we differ from Strategy in that we generate Bitcoin by securing the network through high-performance computing infrastructure. Our business model relies on operational efficiency and energy strategy. In contrast, Strategy is a software company that holds Bitcoin as a treasury asset. They gain exposure through purchases, not production. While both models benefit from Bitcoin appreciation, miners actively contribute to the ecosystem, whereas Strategy is primarily a strategic investor.. While we haven’t had direct discussions with them to date, we’re always open to exploring strategic partnerships if they create value for shareholders and align with our ethos of operational discipline.",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/interview-hive-cfo-hydro-cooled-mining-and-ai-cloud-give-us-an-edge-post-halving/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION","Interviews|Bitcoin|Mining",cryptocompare

2025-06-18T17:50:11,"Iran US Tension: Khamenei Issues Unyielding Warning on War and Peace","BitcoinWorld Iran US Tension: Khamenei Issues Unyielding Warning on War and Peace Geopolitical tremors can send significant waves through global financial markets, and the world of cryptocurrency is certainly not immune. When major players on the international stage issue strong statements, investors everywhere pay attention. The latest development comes from Iran, where Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has delivered a potent message regarding the country’s stance on its relationship with the United States. This statement, reported by Walter Bloomberg on X, underscores the ongoing Iran US tension and adds another layer to the complex global security landscape. Understanding the Latest Iran US Tension The core of the recent news is a direct and unequivocal declaration from Iran’s highest authority. According to reports, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei stated clearly that Iran will not accept an imposed peace or war. This isn’t just diplomatic rhetoric; it signals a firm position against external pressure, whether it’s forcing a resolution or instigating conflict. Furthermore, he issued a stark warning: any attack by the United States will face serious and irreversible consequences. This Khamenei statement is a significant indicator of the current state of relations between the two nations, which have been strained for decades, marked by periods of heightened tension and proxy conflicts in the Middle East. Understanding the context is key. The relationship between Iran and the United States involves a multitude of complex issues, including Iran’s nuclear program, sanctions, regional influence, and maritime security. Statements like this often come during periods where diplomatic efforts are stalled or perceived threats are high. Khamenei’s remarks can be interpreted as a deterrent message, aiming to dissuade potential military action or coercive diplomatic tactics by highlighting the potential costs. How Khamenei’s Statement Amplifies Geopolitical Risk Anytime a major regional power like Iran issues such a strong warning directed at a global superpower like the United States, it immediately heightens geopolitical risk . Geopolitical risk refers to the possibility that political events will affect a market. This can include wars, terrorist attacks, or even just increased political instability and diplomatic friction between nations. Khamenei’s declaration that Iran will not accept an ‘imposed peace or war’ suggests a refusal to be dictated to, implying that any external attempt to force a specific outcome could be met with resistance. The mention of ‘serious and irreversible consequences’ in response to a US attack is particularly significant. This vague but menacing phrase leaves room for interpretation, potentially encompassing a range of retaliatory actions, from cyberattacks to targeting shipping lanes, proxy forces, or even direct military engagement. Such uncertainty is precisely what drives up geopolitical risk premiums in markets. Investors dislike uncertainty, and the prospect of escalation in a volatile region like the Middle East is a major source of concern. Key aspects of amplified geopolitical risk: Increased Uncertainty: The lack of clarity on what ‘serious and irreversible consequences’ entails creates significant market unease. Potential for Disruption: Conflict in the Middle East can disrupt oil supplies, shipping routes, and regional stability, impacting global trade and economies. Policy Reactions: Governments may impose new sanctions or take other defensive/offensive measures, further altering the economic and political landscape. Investor Sentiment: Fear and risk aversion can lead to capital flight from riskier assets to perceived safe havens. Potential Crypto Market Impact of Middle East Conflict So, what does heightened Middle East conflict potential mean for the dynamic world of cryptocurrency? The connection might not be immediately obvious to everyone, but geopolitical events have shown a tangible impact on crypto markets, particularly Bitcoin (BTC). Here’s how the increased geopolitical risk stemming from the Iran US tension could affect the crypto market: 1. Bitcoin as a ‘Safe Haven’ Narrative: During times of traditional market uncertainty and geopolitical instability, Bitcoin has sometimes been framed as a digital ‘safe haven’ asset, similar to gold. The argument is that because it is decentralized, not controlled by any single government, and operates on a global network, it might be seen as a store of value when national currencies or traditional banking systems seem vulnerable. When tensions rise, some investors might move a portion of their wealth into Bitcoin, potentially increasing demand and price. However, this narrative is still debated, and Bitcoin’s volatility means it doesn’t always act as a reliable safe haven. 2. Increased Volatility: Crypto markets are known for their volatility, and major global events tend to amplify this. News of potential conflict or escalating tensions can lead to sharp price swings as traders react to the headlines. This presents both opportunities and significant risks for investors. 3. Capital Flows: If regional instability leads to capital controls or economic uncertainty in affected areas, there might be increased interest in cryptocurrencies as a way to move or preserve wealth outside traditional systems. This was observed, for example, in countries experiencing hyperinflation or political turmoil. 4. Impact on Global Liquidity: Major geopolitical events can influence global liquidity and investor risk appetite. If traditional markets face significant sell-offs due to fear, this can sometimes spill over into crypto, as investors might sell any liquid asset to cover losses or reduce overall exposure to risk. It’s important to note that the crypto market is influenced by many factors, and geopolitical events are just one piece of the puzzle. However, a significant escalation in the Middle East could certainly become a dominant factor in market movements for a period. Navigating Uncertainty: Actionable Insights for the Crypto Investor Given the potential for heightened geopolitical risk and its possible impact on the crypto market impact , what steps can investors take? While no one can predict market movements with certainty, here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch not only on crypto news but also on major global geopolitical developments, particularly those involving the Iran US tension and the broader Middle East conflict situation. Reliable news sources (like the one reporting the Khamenei statement ) are crucial. Evaluate Your Risk Tolerance: Understand that periods of high geopolitical risk often mean increased market volatility. Ensure your investment portfolio aligns with your comfort level regarding potential price swings. Consider Diversification: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversifying across different cryptocurrencies, and potentially across different asset classes, can help mitigate risk. Think Long-Term: Trying to time the market based on unpredictable geopolitical events is extremely difficult. For many investors, focusing on their long-term investment strategy is often more prudent than reacting impulsively to short-term news. Secure Your Assets: In times of global uncertainty, the security of your digital assets is paramount. Ensure you are using strong passwords, two-factor authentication, and consider hardware wallets for significant holdings. Avoid Leverage if Unsure: Trading with leverage during volatile periods amplified by geopolitical risk can lead to rapid and substantial losses. This is not financial advice, but rather general guidance on approaching markets during uncertain times. The key is to be prepared, informed, and measured in your approach. Conclusion: Watching the Horizon Supreme Leader Khamenei’s firm declaration that Iran will not accept an imposed peace or war, coupled with the warning of serious consequences for any US attack, is a significant statement that highlights the enduring Iran US tension . This adds a layer of complexity to the global geopolitical landscape and undeniably increases geopolitical risk , particularly concerning potential Middle East conflict . While the direct link between these political statements and the crypto market impact might seem indirect, history shows that major global uncertainties can influence investor behavior and market dynamics, sometimes pushing assets like Bitcoin into the spotlight as potential, albeit volatile, safe havens. The Khamenei statement serves as a reminder that external factors can play a significant role in market sentiment. As the situation develops, market participants will be closely watching for any signs of escalation or de-escalation. For those involved in cryptocurrency, staying informed about both geopolitical developments and market reactions is essential for navigating the potential volatility that such high-stakes international relations can introduce.

Despite EU regulators’ warnings, BBVA has been active in crypto markets since 2021. Spanish banks, such as BBVA and Santander, are expanding into crypto amid growing demand. BBVA, the second-largest bank in Spain, is encouraging its wealthy customers to invest some of their funds in a digital currency. The bank suggests holding 3-7% of their portfolio in crypto-assets such as Bitcoin . The decision was made as the bank attempts to attract more conventional investors to the emerging cryptocurrency market. Philippe Meyer, the head of digital and blockchain solutions of BBVA Switzerland, affirmed the strategy. According to him, the bank began advising its clients regarding Bitcoin in September last year. This recommendation aligned with the broader efforts to encourage clients to diversify their portfolios by incorporating alternative assets. 3% Crypto Boosts Portfolio Performance Meyer underlined that the results of crypto additions to portfolios were significant, even given minor investments.

2025-06-18T17:40:11,"ANAP Bitcoin Purchase: Japanese Fashion Giant Accelerates Bold Crypto Strategy","BitcoinWorld ANAP Bitcoin Purchase: Japanese Fashion Giant Accelerates Bold Crypto Strategy In a move turning heads in both the fashion and finance worlds, Japanese fashion company ANAP Holdings recently announced a substantial increase in its Bitcoin (BTC) reserves. This latest acquisition signals a growing trend of companies looking to integrate digital assets into their treasury strategies, and ANAP is certainly making a bold statement. ANAP Bitcoin Purchase: What Are the Details? According to a press release issued on June 18th, ANAP Holdings completed the purchase of an additional 31.2108 Bitcoin. This acquisition came at a cost of 479.95 million yen, which translates to approximately $3.31 million USD at the time of the announcement. This isn’t ANAP’s first foray into the crypto market. With this latest buy, their total Bitcoin holdings have grown significantly. The company now holds a cumulative 184.6735 BTC. The total investment into these Bitcoin reserves stands at around 2.75 billion yen, roughly equivalent to $18.98 million USD. What’s even more intriguing is ANAP’s stated ambition. Earlier reports indicated the company’s intention to acquire a substantial amount of Bitcoin, setting a target of accumulating north of 1,000 BTC by August. This recent purchase brings them closer to that ambitious goal, demonstrating a clear commitment to their digital asset strategy. Why is a Fashion Brand Investing in Bitcoin? Exploring the Fashion Brand Bitcoin Trend You might be wondering why a company primarily known for fashion retail is diving deep into cryptocurrency. The decision by ANAP Holdings reflects a broader shift seen across various industries, where companies are exploring alternatives for their corporate treasuries beyond traditional cash reserves and low-yield investments. Several factors could be driving this Fashion brand Bitcoin adoption: Store of Value: Bitcoin is often seen as a potential hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, particularly in uncertain economic times. Companies holding large cash reserves see their purchasing power erode over time. Balance Sheet Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin can help diversify the company’s balance sheet, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Potential for Appreciation: While volatile, Bitcoin has historically shown significant long-term growth potential, offering the possibility of substantial returns on investment. Innovation and Brand Image: For a fashion brand, embracing a cutting-edge technology like Bitcoin could also align with an innovative brand image and potentially appeal to a tech-savvy customer base. ANAP’s move is a notable example of how companies outside the traditional finance or tech sectors are seriously considering and executing Fashion brand Bitcoin strategies. Japan Corporate Bitcoin: Is the Trend Picking Up Speed? ANAP Holdings operates within Japan, a country with a relatively developed regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies compared to some other nations. While not as prominent in corporate Bitcoin holdings as, say, the United States with companies like MicroStrategy, there are signs of increasing interest in Japan corporate Bitcoin adoption. Japan has long been a significant market for cryptocurrency trading and innovation. The regulatory clarity, though evolving, provides a foundation for companies to consider digital assets. ANAP’s significant purchase could potentially inspire other Japanese corporations to explore similar strategies, contributing to a broader trend of Japan corporate Bitcoin accumulation. This development aligns with a global movement towards greater Bitcoin institutional adoption . As more public and private companies allocate portions of their treasury reserves to Bitcoin, it lends further legitimacy to the asset class and can influence market dynamics. Understanding the ANAP Holdings BTC Strategy: Benefits and Risks ANAP Holdings’ decision to build a substantial ANAP Holdings BTC reserve comes with potential upsides and inherent risks. It’s important to look at both sides of the coin. Potential Benefits: Asset Growth: If Bitcoin’s value appreciates, ANAP’s balance sheet could see significant gains. Inflation Hedge: Protects the value of corporate reserves against potential inflation of the Japanese Yen. First-Mover Advantage (in Japan): Being an early, prominent corporate holder in Japan could provide a unique position. Attracting Talent/Customers: Could appeal to a younger, crypto-aware demographic. Potential Risks: Price Volatility: Bitcoin is known for dramatic price swings, which could negatively impact the company’s financial statements in the short term. Regulatory Changes: Future regulatory shifts in Japan or globally could affect the holding or trading of Bitcoin. Security Risks: Holding significant amounts of crypto requires robust security measures to prevent theft or loss. Accounting Treatment: Accounting for cryptocurrency holdings can be complex and subject to changing standards. The company is clearly betting that the long-term benefits outweigh the short-term volatility and risks associated with their ANAP Holdings BTC strategy. Broader Implications: The Rise of Bitcoin Institutional Adoption ANAP’s move is a piece of a much larger puzzle: the increasing trend of Bitcoin institutional adoption . While companies like MicroStrategy, which holds over 200,000 BTC, are often cited as pioneers, the list of corporations adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets continues to grow. This trend signifies a maturation of the Bitcoin market. It’s moving beyond just individual investors and speculative trading to become a recognized, albeit still volatile, asset class for corporate treasuries and large institutions. The motivations are often similar: seeking alternatives to low-yield cash, hedging against macroeconomic uncertainty, and recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a digital store of value. The increasing participation of institutions and corporations like ANAP can have several effects on the market, including: Potentially increasing demand and reducing circulating supply available on exchanges. Adding a layer of stability as institutional holders often have longer investment horizons than retail traders. Enhancing the credibility and mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin. What Does This Mean for Investors? For individual investors watching the market, corporate moves like ANAP’s provide interesting signals. They suggest that sophisticated financial teams within traditional companies are increasingly comfortable with Bitcoin as a legitimate asset. It doesn’t necessarily mean everyone should rush out and buy Bitcoin, but it does highlight the growing acceptance and strategic thinking around digital assets in the corporate world. It reinforces the narrative that Bitcoin is being viewed not just as a speculative gamble, but as a potential long-term treasury asset. Conclusion ANAP Holdings’ recent ANAP Bitcoin purchase is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a clear indicator of their strategic direction and belief in the future role of digital assets. By significantly increasing their Bitcoin reserves and setting an ambitious target of over 1,000 BTC, the Japanese fashion giant is positioning itself within the growing wave of Bitcoin institutional adoption . This development in Japan corporate Bitcoin strategy by a prominent Fashion brand Bitcoin holder like ANAP underscores the evolving landscape where companies from diverse sectors are exploring and implementing digital asset strategies. While risks remain due to volatility, the move highlights the potential benefits companies see in holding Bitcoin as part of a modern treasury management approach.
