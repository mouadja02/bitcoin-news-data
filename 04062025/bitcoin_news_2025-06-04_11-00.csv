2025-06-04T08:52:54,"No Signs of Bitcoin Retail Frenzy: On-Chain Demand Slows in Crypto Market","Bitcoin has steadied itself a little above $105K after retracing from its recently established all-time high. However, retail euphoria has yet to materialize in the current crypto market. In fact, on-chain data now shows a 2.45% decline in demand from smaller investors over the past 30 days. Retail Caution Persists According to an update shared by CryptoQuant, transactions under $10,000, a common sign for retail activity, indicate that sentiment remains cautious rather than exuberant. While some retail participants may be gaining exposure through ETFs or Bitcoin Treasury Companies, on-chain activity typically reflects broader market sentiment. The lack of euphoric behavior suggests the market remains structurally subdued, which leaves room for potential bullish momentum, provided buying pressure builds in a “sustainable” manner. It is still important to note that broader macroeconomic and regulatory factors could influence short-term sentiment and risk appetite, potentially deterring large capital inflows. Until retail enthusiasm returns in force, the market may struggle to gain the conviction needed for a significant breakout. The institutional pullback further added to the cautious tone already visible in retail behavior. Over the past three consecutive trading sessions, Santiment found that Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have experienced a combined net outflow of $1.21 billion. This is the first time since the second week of March that such large-scale withdrawals have been recorded. The outflows suggest investors are reducing exposure to Bitcoin through institutional vehicles, potentially in response to macroeconomic uncertainty. While Bitcoin’s spot price has not shown sharp declines, the ETF movement could be an early indicator of waning confidence. Meanwhile, long-time Bitcoin whales appear to be doing the same. Whales Cashing Out Large Bitcoin holders with more than 10,000 BTC have been steadily taking profits following the cryptocurrency’s recent ATH, according to analyst Willy Woo. In a recent update , Woo pointed out that these “mega whales” have been net sellers since 2017, even as institutional and sovereign buyers are now entering the market with billion-dollar allocations. He also noted that most of these holdings were acquired at prices between $0 and $700, and have been held for 8 to 16 years. The analyst Willy Woo believes that while buying Bitcoin at six-figure prices may not make sense for those focused on short-term gains, it remains a strong long-term play. “If you’re gonna die tomorrow probably not. If you’ve got another 10 years to live or more, it’s probably one of the best investments you’ll see in your investment career.” The post No Signs of Bitcoin Retail Frenzy: On-Chain Demand Slows in Crypto Market appeared first on CryptoPotato .",cryptopotato,https://cryptopotato.com/no-signs-of-bitcoin-retail-frenzy-on-chain-demand-slows-in-crypto-market/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","AA News|BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Bitcoin ETF|Bitcoin Whales",cryptocompare

2025-06-04T08:09:10,"XRP News Today: Ripple CEO Denies $5B Circle Acquisition Rumors","Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has dismissed claims that the company sought to acquire stablecoin issuer Circle , putting an end to weeks of speculation. Key Takeaways: Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse denied rumors of a $10–$20 billion bid to acquire Circle. Circle remains focused on its IPO plans and dismissed acquisition speculation. Ripple is advancing real-world tokenization projects, including Dubai’s real estate initiative on XRPL. Speaking at the XRP Las Vegas conference, Garlinghouse addressed the widely circulated rumors during a fireside chat with fintech policy expert Chris Brummer. Brummer later summarized the discussion in a post on X , noting that the Ripple chief “refuted” the idea that Ripple ever made a $10 to $20 billion bid for Circle. Ripple’s Alleged $5B Circle Bid First Surfaced in April Rumors of a possible acquisition first surfaced in April, with reports suggesting Ripple had initially offered between $4 billion and $5 billion. Some outlets later claimed the offer was raised to as high as $20 billion. Garlinghouse did not confirm whether an initial offer was made but made clear that Ripple was not pursuing an outright takeover. Circle also moved to quash the speculation, stating that it remains focused on long-term objectives. The company has since filed for an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, planning to offer 24 million shares priced between $24 and $26. Beyond the acquisition rumors, Garlinghouse provided insights on several key initiatives during the conference. Ripple’s acquisition of prime brokerage firm Hidden Road was a topic of discussion. According to Brummer, the deal underscores Ripple’s ambition to position its RLUSD token as an on-ledger collateral asset. 48 hours ago I joined @bgarlinghouse on stage in Las Vegas to get his thoughts on the future of @Ripple . While the session wasn’t broadcast live, I found his remarks quite interesting, and worth a tweet. Quick overview/takeaways: · Brad was unequivocal that Ripple didn't pursue… pic.twitter.com/6a3lI8DZZj — Chris Brummer (@ChrisBrummerDr) June 3, 2025 Hidden Road is expected to integrate RLUSD into its services, a move Garlinghouse described as part of a broader “infrastructural” strategy aimed at strengthening the crypto ecosystem. Garlinghouse also highlighted the growing role of tokenization in real-world applications. He pointed to Dubai’s decision to use the XRP Ledger (XRPL) for a real estate tokenization project. In partnership with the Dubai Land Department, Ctrl Alt, the Dubai Future Foundation, and the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority, the initiative will issue tokenized property title deeds on XRPL. The Ripple CEO called the project an example of tokenization moving from concept to practical implementation. Ripple CEO Asks for Unity Within Crypto Lastly, Garlinghouse urged greater unity within the crypto industry. He referenced Ripple’s donation of the “Skull of Satoshi” to the Bitcoin community as a gesture aimed at fostering collaboration. He warned that ongoing conflicts between crypto factions only serve to hinder the industry’s progress. As reported, the publicly listed energy company VivoPower is investing $121 million in XRP as a strategic reserve, making it the first company in the world with an XRP-focused treasury.

The “Realized Cap” here refers to an indicator that measures BTC’s total value by assuming the ‘real’ value of any token in circulation is equal to the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. Since the previous transfer for any coin is likely to correspond to the last point at which it changed hands, the price at the time could be considered as its current cost basis. Thus, the Realized Cap is nothing, but the sum of the acquisition prices of all tokens part of the circulating supply. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Go ‘Bananas’ If Price Closes Above This Level, Top Analyst Says In other words, the indicator represents the total amount of capital that the investors as a whole used to purchase their coins. A modified version of the metric, known as the Realized Cap HODL Waves, keeps track of the same, except for just a particular segment of the sector. In the context of the current discussion, the investor cohort of interest is the 3 years to 5 years one. This group includes all the holders who have been keeping their coins dormant since between three and five years ago. Now, here is the chart for the Realized Cap of the cohort shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in its value over the last couple of years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Realized Cap controlled by the 3 years to 5 years investors hit an all-time high (ATH) share of 15.7% back in November. But soon after this peak formed, these investors started a sharp selloff, taking advantage of the profitable opportunity that the rally presented. Then in January, the group paused its selling, but resumed it again in April, suggesting some of these resolute hands took the exit door during the latest price rally. A zoomed in view of the chart reveals, however, that the selling may have most recently hit a state of exhaustion once more. That said, while the supply has shown the start of a potential sideways phase, it doesn’t mean that the 3 years to 5 years investors no longer pose a threat to Bitcoin. The cohort still holds 11.9% of the asset’s Realized Cap, which is quite significant.

2025-06-04T08:00:01,"Why Bitcoin price could hit $150K before Ethereum hits $4,000 again","The Bitcoin price has been holding firm above the $100K level in recent days, while Ethereum stagnates following a major trend shift in May. From technical indicators to the favourable economic factors, top institutional traders are calling for the Bitcoin price to soar as high as $150,000. Meanwhile, Ethereum has shown signs of recovery, but its path to $4,000 remains hampered by stiff competition from innovative projects like Solana. Consequently, Ethereum’s sentiment is in a cautious mood as market participants buy into a PayFi altcoin with a sustainable growth advantage. Bitcoin price surpasses last quarter’s high with historic validation The Bitcoin price started June in a consolidation phase, but has achieved its highest monthly close in history at $104,000. This price action reflects strong momentum in the Bitcoin market. In the face of this growing sentiment, Bitcoin futures open interest reached a peak of just over $80 billion, according to CoinGlass. It’s an increase of 30% since the start of May as derivatives speculators load up on leverage in anticipation of higher Bitcoin prices. Source: CoinGlass Meanwhile, Glassnode data reports that Bitcoin’s Realized HODL Ratio has recently dropped to 3,493. The metric measures the relative wealth distribution between short-term and long-term Bitcoin holders. In Bitcoin’s case, it suggests that, despite the recent all-time high, Bitcoin’s price has not reached its cycle top yet and all eyes are on the $150K price level. Ethereum price jumps 14%, but it still lags in yearly performance The Ethereum price experienced significant volatility in May, jumping by more than 15%. This price action has fueled hopes of a price rebound towards $4,000. Zooming out, Ethereum is less likely to achieve this target in this bull cycle, as the ETH chart indicates a bearish trend since the beginning of the year. Technical indicators are firmly in red with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) falling below 50 while the MACD is negative on the yearly chart. Source: JustinBennettFX on X Amid this market sentiment, market proponents like Garrison Yang, Co-Founder of the Web3 development studio Mirai Labs, continue to argue that Ethereum remains overvalued. Yang states that Ethereum no longer functions effectively as an asset or a store of value, with costly fees proving a hurdle for transactions. The Layer-2 ecosystem accrues all the hype and value, while Ethereum does not benefit. Nothing illustrates this better than Ethereum’s current failing market sentiment. Remittix (RTX): the PayFi altcoin ETH investors are rushing In every financial shift, the early movers are always the first to see what the rest of the world overlooks. Just as PayPal revolutionized digital payments and Stripe empowered startups, Remittix is now positioning itself as the disruptor of the $250+ trillion cross-border payments industry. Source: Remittix Ethereum smart investors know this pattern and they’re moving their funds to the next wave: PayFi. In this sector, Remittix is flipping the script with real-time crypto-to-fiat transfers to any bank, anywhere, no banks, no borders, no costly fees. This isn’t just another payments app. It’s a fully functional, blockchain-powered bridge that lets users send, receive and convert digital assets with ease. This unique value proposition has attracted Ethereum whales looking for a haven from adverse price action. Remittix’s ICO figures back this up. Surpassing 20,000 holders with tokens at $0.0781, over $15.5M has been raised and 541M+ RTX sold within months. Conclusion While the Ethereum price is currently experiencing slight bullish momentum, its struggles with selling pressure may not be over. With this trend, smart whales are quietly accumulating Remittix tokens, betting on PayFi’s massive potential in cross-border payments.

2025-06-04T07:58:12,"HTX DeepThink: Inflation Cools and Rate-Cut Bets Rise—Why Is Crypto Still Under Pressure?","In early June, the crypto market finds itself in a delicate balance—buoyed by supportive policy signals yet constrained by tightening liquidity. Despite ongoing disinflation and rising expectations for Fed rate cuts, high-beta assets remain under short-term pressure. This week, Chloe (@ ChloeTalk1 ) from HTX Research analyzes the evolving macro liquidity landscape and market structure, breaking down the sources of Bitcoin’s resilience and the potential systemic risks facing altcoins. Global Markets React to Escalating Geopolitical Tensions Last week, President Trump announced plans to raise tariffs on imported steel and aluminum from 25% to 50%, with intentions to broaden tariffs to cover critical minerals. The European Union promptly issued warnings of retaliatory measures. Meanwhile, Ukraine launched a substantial drone strike targeting Russian air bases, significantly escalating the conflict with Russia. Amidst this intensified global geopolitical risk, demand for safe-haven assets surged, leading to a notable rise in gold prices. Despite OPEC+’s decision to increase oil production by 411,000 barrels per day starting in July, oil prices continued their upward trend, driven by supply concerns and regional instability. Core Inflation Cools, Paving the Way for Potential Fed Dovishness April PCE data showed a continued cooling in inflation, with the core PCE index decreasing to 2.5% year-over-year. This represents the lowest level since 2021,indicating that inflation is approaching the Federal Reserve’s long-term target. Meanwhile, real personal consumption growth slowed sharply from 0.7% in March to just 0.1% in April, highlighting weakening domestic demand and supporting the “soft landing” narrative. While Fed Governor Christopher Waller acknowledged the potential for tariffs to cause a temporary uptick in prices, he affirmed that a rate cut later this year remains a viable option. The market now broadly expects the first rate cut to occur in September. Bond Market Sounds Alarm as Yields Approach Critical Levels Despite recent dovish inflation data, U.S. Treasury yields have experienced a significant surge. The 30-year yield has risen to 5%, nearing its 2023 peak, while the 10-year yield has approached 4.6%. This upward movement is primarily driven by several factors: fiscal concerns surrounding a proposed tax cut package from Congress, and spillover pressure from overseas bond markets—especially a wave of selling in Japanese government bonds. This strong capital absorption by Treasuries is consequently exerting downward pressure on risk asset valuations, including Bitcoin and other high-beta digital assets. BTC Stable, Altcoins at Risk Bitcoin is currently navigating a complex environment characterized by an interplay of supportive policy developments and tightening liquidity conditions. On the positive side, accelerating regulatory progress—such as stablecoin frameworks, token legislation, and tax exemptions, along with institutional BTC purchases continue to offer strong long-term support. However, rising U.S. Treasury yields and the Treasury General Account (TGA) replenishment are draining liquidity, limiting BTC’s immediate upward trajectory and keeping its price range-bound. On-chain data shows that approximately 89% of short-term holders are still in profit, nearing historical highs and signaling a risk of profit-taking pressure. Meanwhile, around 70% of long-term holders remain in profit, suggesting overall structural resilience. The MVRV Z-Score has risen to around +1.6, reflecting an optimistic but not yet overheated market sentiment. In the derivatives market, open interest in Bitcoin futures remains elevated above $23 billion, indicating heavy leverage exposure. Furthermore, positive funding rates across major exchanges and increasing skew in the options market point to a growing demand for downside protection. Collectively, while Bitcoin remains within a medium-term bullish structure, the high concentration of short-term profits and elevated leverage suggest that near-term volatility could intensify. The market’s next directional move will likely depend on clearer macroeconomic signals. As for altcoins, their higher volatility and lack of structural support may leave them more vulnerable to broader market corrections compared to major crypto assets. *The above content is not an investment advice and does not constitute any offer or solicitation to offer or recommendation of any investment product.

2025-06-04T07:40:22,"Ripple CEO Makes Compelling Revelation That Sparks XRP Army’s Reaction","In a closed-door session in Las Vegas, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse joined renowned academic and digital finance thought leader Chris Brummer on stage to discuss the evolving strategy of Ripple and the broader implications for the crypto industry. Brummer took to X to share a detailed breakdown of the discussion, and his observations have stirred considerable interest within the XRP community and beyond. Brummer, who is widely respected for his insights into financial regulation and tokenization, offered a nuanced summary of Garlinghouse’s remarks. According to him, the Ripple chief made it clear that the firm had not pursued an acquisition of Circle , the issuer of the USDC stablecoin. There had been previous market speculation that Ripple had floated a $10 billion offer for Circle, but Garlinghouse unequivocally dismissed that claim. However, Brummer noted that Garlinghouse left room for interpretation, possibly suggesting that while Ripple didn’t offer $10 billion, some level of exploratory engagement might have occurred. Regardless, Garlinghouse’s main point was unmistakable: Ripple has no current plans to acquire Circle, and his sentiments toward the firm were respectful but detached. 48 hours ago I joined @bgarlinghouse on stage in Las Vegas to get his thoughts on the future of @Ripple . While the session wasn’t broadcast live, I found his remarks quite interesting, and worth a tweet. Quick overview/takeaways: · Brad was unequivocal that Ripple didn't pursue… pic.twitter.com/6a3lI8DZZj — Chris Brummer (@ChrisBrummerDr) June 3, 2025 RLUSD and Ripple’s Infrastructure Ambitions Perhaps one of the most intriguing takeaways from the session was Garlinghouse’s vision for RLUSD, Ripple’s U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin. Brummer emphasized that RLUSD is not merely another stablecoin offering in an increasingly crowded space, it represents a foundational element in Ripple’s broader infrastructure play. Specifically, the stablecoin is expected to serve as on-ledger collateral for transactions, with all activities recorded immutably on the XRP Ledger. This aligns with Ripple’s longstanding commitment to building institutional-grade financial infrastructure, rather than chasing speculative hype cycles. By embedding RLUSD into the XRP Ledger as native collateral, Ripple is taking steps to enable seamless, transparent, and programmable financial services that can scale across both crypto-native and traditional financial markets. Tokenized Real Estate in the UAE Garlinghouse also revealed that Ripple is currently engaged in meaningful conversations with authorities in the United Arab Emirates around tokenized real estate projects . According to Brummer, this initiative is already in motion, not just a conceptual pitch. Tokenization, often discussed in abstract terms in Western markets, is taking on a tangible, pragmatic shape in jurisdictions like the UAE, where regulatory frameworks are more conducive to experimentation and implementation. The focus on high-value real estate assets underscores Ripple’s strategy to target prime asset classes in its tokenization endeavors. By doing so, Ripple is not only positioning the XRP Ledger as a viable platform for real-world assets (RWAs) but also strengthening its appeal to institutional investors looking to bridge traditional finance with blockchain-based efficiencies. Diplomacy in the Crypto Space The session also took a philosophical turn as Garlinghouse addressed the often-toxic culture within the crypto ecosystem. He criticized the ongoing trend of crypto projects publicly disparaging one another, warning that such behavior undermines the credibility of the entire industry. In a symbolic gesture, Ripple recently donated a replica of the Satoshi Nakamoto skull to the Bitcoin community, an act Garlinghouse described as a sincere effort to promote unity, not a marketing stunt. Brummer interpreted this gesture as an important diplomatic move, especially in an environment where tribalism often eclipses collaborative progress. Garlinghouse’s remarks struck a chord with many in the audience, particularly members of the XRP Army, who have long felt marginalized by other crypto factions despite Ripple’s pivotal role in shaping the regulatory and financial contours of blockchain adoption. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Personal Reflections on the SEC In a rare moment of candor, Garlinghouse recounted his interactions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), offering a glimpse into the personal toll the agency’s lawsuit against Ripple has taken. While he refrained from litigating the details publicly, Brummer observed a noticeable emotional intensity in his words, a reminder that the high-stakes legal battles playing out in Washington involve real people, not just corporate entities or faceless institutions. The SEC’s case against Ripple, which began in December 2020, has had far-reaching implications for the regulatory classification of digital assets. Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling was a partial victory for Ripple and the crypto industry. However, the case is not yet over. A Hybrid Future for Finance The overarching theme of Garlinghouse’s message was that Ripple is not aiming to supplant traditional finance (TradFi), but rather to integrate with it. As Brummer eloquently put it, Ripple is betting on a hybridized financial future—one where tokenized assets, stablecoins, and legacy banking institutions coexist and interoperate fluidly. This vision has profound implications for Ripple’s strategic direction. Instead of acquiring the next decentralized exchange or meme-coin platform, Ripple is likely to target key TradFi touchpoints: fiat on-ramps, payment processors, prime brokerages, and other core infrastructure providers. These are not merely “picks and shovels,” but the vital bridges that will connect the old financial world with the emerging decentralized paradigm. The XRP Community Reacts As expected, the XRP community has responded. Many members of the XRP Army took to X to express support for Ripple’s long-term vision, praising Garlinghouse’s clarity , and strategic foresight. However, some raised question on the position of XRP token in the ecosystem and if the token is being implemented as bridge currecy as portraid. In an industry often driven by hype, volatility, and short-term thinking, Ripple’s consistent focus on infrastructure, regulation, and institutional collaboration stands out. The revelations from Garlinghouse’s conversation with Chris Brummer not only reaffirm Ripple’s core strategy but also offer a compelling preview of the future it envisions—a future where XRP, and the ledger it powers, play a central role in global finance.

With a unanimous 68-0 vote, the bill now heads to the Senate, and if approved, it could make California one of the most crypto-friendly states in the U.S. The bill now moves to the Senate for further consideration. JUST IN: California Assembly passes bill to allow the state to receive payments in Bitcoin and digital currencies. It passed 68-0, and now heads to the Senate. pic.twitter.com/3JWXlpuEWh — Bitcoin Laws (@Bitcoin_Laws) June 3, 2025 Crypto Payments One Step Closer to Reality AB 1180 would authorize the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) to draft rules allowing state agencies to accept cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum as payments under the Digital Financial Assets Law (DFAL). If passed by the Senate and signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, the law will take effect on July 1, 2026, with a pilot program running until January 2031. The DFPI, which oversees financial services and crypto businesses in the state, would be tasked with tracking all crypto transactions and reporting findings, including regulatory and technical issues, by 2028. This initiative follows similar moves by states like Florida, Colorado, and Louisiana, signaling a growing state-level trend toward blockchain integration. Additionally, California is the largest investor in MicroStrategy, a company known for its Bitcoin holdings , with its public pension funds holding a $276 million stake, reflecting growing institutional interest in cryptocurrency. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Is Elon Musk Buying More Bitcoin? , Bitcoin Rights on the Horizon The bill also complements AB 1052 as California’s “Bitcoin rights” bill, which passed its first committee in May with unanimous support. That bill aims to solidify crypto self-custody rights and prohibit public agencies from restricting digital assets purely for being used as payments. Together, both bills could establish a broad legal foundation for crypto use in California. With nearly 117 merchants in the state already accepting Bitcoin, this new legislation could accelerate California’s transition into a blockchain-forward economy, setting a precedent that could ripple across the nation. As terms like crypto adoption , Bitcoin payments, and crypto regulation trend, California might just lead the next wave of mainstream blockchain integration. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

OKX Announces Global Dollar (USDG) Listing: Transaction and Transfer Schedule Revealed According to the official statement made by the platform, the start of trading of USDG on the exchange and transfer transactions will take place according to the following schedule: USDG Listing Schedule: USDG deposits: June 4, 2025, 14:00 USDG/USDT pair aggregate price determination (pre-opening session): June 5, 2025, 20:00–21:00 Start of spot transactions: June 5, 2025, 21:00 Opening of withdrawal transactions: June 5, 2025, 23:00 Risk Controls for Spot Transactions In order to prevent extreme price fluctuations in new token listings, OKX will implement the following measures during the first 5 minutes: Market orders will be prohibited. Maximum transaction limit for limit orders: 10,000 USD. Net position limit per user: $10,000. These restrictions will be lifted 5 minutes after the transaction starts. In addition, the limit price mechanism to be applied in spot transactions will be activated with different algorithms until the price stability of the new token is achieved. Either the past closing price or an index will be used as the price reference. USDG/USDT Bulk Order Matching (Opening Session) The USDG/USDT pair will be available for trading with a one-hour “mass order matching” (call auction) mechanism. During this process, investors will be able to place orders at the prices they want; the system will then evaluate all orders and determine a reference opening price. Single user purchase limit: 50,000 USD Only limit orders can be placed in the last 5 minutes; cancellations or changes cannot be made. After the mass price determination, the opening price provided by the token's development team will be presented to investors for informational purposes. However, this price will not affect user orders. What is USDG? Global Dollar (USDG) is a dollar-backed stablecoin available on the Ethereum and Solana networks. Issued by regulated entities, USDG is backed by highly liquid safe assets and is convertible 1:1 to USD. USDG can be traded on various exchanges and digital wallets. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-04T07:06:40,"Could Bitcoin Replace USD? Coinbase CEO Flags Risk as US Debt Hits $37 Trillion","Key Takeaways: Coinbase CEO warns Bitcoin could replace USD as reserve currency if US debt remains unchecked. A Trump-backed spending bill faces criticism for potentially worsening the $37 trillion national debt. Bitcoin’s fixed supply and rising institutional demand are fueling its appeal as a hedge against fiscal instability. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has warned that Bitcoin could eventually replace the USD as the world’s reserve currency if lawmakers fail to address America’s spiraling debt. “I love Bitcoin, but a strong America is also super important for the world,” Armstrong posted on X Tuesday. “We need to get our finances under control.” The U.S. national debt recently crossed $37 trillion, adding fresh urgency to concerns about long-term fiscal stability. If the electorate doesn't hold congress accountable to reducing the deficit, and start paying down the debt, Bitcoin is going to take over as reserve currency. I love Bitcoin, but a strong America is also super important for the world. We need to get our finances under control. https://t.co/aeBE7pUuHo — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) June 4, 2025 Trump-Backed Spending Bill Advances as US Debt Worries Mount Armstrong’s comments come as House Republicans advance a Trump-backed spending bill that extends tax cuts, boosts military funding, and slashes programs like Medicaid, food aid, and clean energy. Critics argue the legislation would worsen the debt outlook. A group of six Nobel Prize-winning economists, including Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz, warned in a June letter that the bill could push public debt even higher, by at least $3 trillion, if its provisions are made permanent. The growing debt burden is drawing new attention to Bitcoin, which was designed after the 2008 financial crisis as a fixed-supply, inflation-resistant asset. With institutional demand rising, some analysts say BTC is becoming an increasingly credible hedge. Tesla CEO Elon Musk also weighed in, blasting the spending bill as a “massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill” and a “disgusting abomination.” It will massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit to $2.5 trillion (!!!) and burden America citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt https://t.co/dHCj3pprJO — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 3, 2025 US Eyes Bitcoin Reserve to Tackle Soaring Debt With the U.S. national debt now exceeding $37 trillion, lawmakers are floating bold new ideas to stabilize the country’s finances — and Bitcoin may soon play a central role. Last year, Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced a proposal to establish a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, positioning the cryptocurrency as a hedge against inflation and fiscal instability. The bill, which gained fresh momentum after Donald Trump’s 2024 election victory, would direct the U.S. Treasury to gradually accumulate 1 million BTC — approximately 5% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Modeled after the government’s gold reserves, the Bitcoin would be stored across a decentralized network of secure vaults, with purchases funded by existing Treasury assets. Lummis argued that the Bitcoin reserve could help offset the declining value of the dollar and protect American families from the long-term effects of inflation. “We must take bold steps to secure our economic future,” she said, calling Bitcoin a modern store of value. Trump has previously pledged to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet,” with Bitcoin now emerging as a potential pillar of national economic strategy. The post Could Bitcoin Replace USD?

2025-06-04T07:04:20,"Fundstrat’s Tom Lee Unveils Astronomical Bitcoin Price Target, Says BTC Witnessing ‘Huge’ Supply-Demand Imbalance","Investor Tom Lee believes that Bitcoin ( BTC ) will reach his ambitious price target over a long arc of time. In a new CNBC interview, Fundstrat’s CIO says Bitcoin looks poised to hit new all-time highs this year, driven by an expanding global money supply. According to Lee, he expects Bitcoin to surge by at least 41% from current levels before the year expires. “Bitcoin is responding to global liquidity, which is moving up. And I think it’s anticipating a dovish Fed next year, so that’s a tailwind for Bitcoin. Bitwise has a great stat: 95% of all Bitcoin has been mined, but 95% of the world doesn’t own Bitcoin. So I just think that there’s still a huge demand versus supply imbalance, meaning there’s a lot more potential buyers of Bitcoin over the next 10 years. So I think there’s a lot of upside to year-end… Yeah, [I got a target] of $150,000, maybe $200,000 or even $250,000 this year.” But over an extended period of time, Lee sees Bitcoin catching up to or even surpassing the market cap of gold, ultimately leading to a massive price tag for BTC. “I think at a minimum, it should have the same network value as gold, and if you look at above-ground gold, it’s probably $23 trillion, so that would $1.2 million for Bitcoin. But I think Bitcoin is more valuable than gold. Bitcoin could be $2 million, $3 million long term, even higher.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $105,900.

2025-06-04T07:00:28,"President Trump’s Truth Social Aims For A Slice Of The Bitcoin ETF Market","President Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform is taking a significant step toward introducing its own Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). This move is intended to compete with the world’s largest asset managers, who have increasingly adopted cryptocurrencies over the past year. Trump’s Truth Social Files For Bitcoin ETF On Tuesday, NYSE Arca, the all-electronic division of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) responsible for most exchange-traded fund trading , filed a 19b-4 form to list a Bitcoin fund associated with Trump’s media company. This filing is a crucial prerequisite for regulatory approval, enabling the fund to launch and trade on a US exchange. Named the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF, this fund is designed to mirror the price movements of the market’s leading cryptocurrency, providing a more accessible avenue for investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency without the need to hold the asset directly. This initiative comes on the heels of a partnership announced in March between Trump Media and Crypto.com, aimed at developing a range of digital asset products slated for release later this year, contingent on regulatory approval. $2.5 Billion Bitcoin Treasury And Upcoming ETF According to a CNBC report on Tuesday, the upcoming offerings are expected to include a mix of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Crypto.com’s native Cronos (CRO) token, alongside traditional securities. These products will be branded under Trump Media and made available to a global audience through major brokerage platforms and the Crypto.com app, which serves over 140 million users worldwide. Since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, the market has experienced remarkable growth, swelling to over $130 billion in total assets. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) currently dominates the market , boasting nearly $69 billion in assets, making it the largest digital asset manager globally. These investment products contributed significantly to the record high reached by BTC last week, nearing the $112,000 mark. Over the past two weeks, BlackRock’s IBIT ETF, Fidelity’s FBTC, and Grayscale’s Mini Trust ETF have received nearly $1 billion in inflows, according to Farside data . Trump is the majority owner of Truth Social’s parent company, Trump Media & Technology Group, which has made several strategic moves aligned with the cryptocurrency sector in recent months. These moves include trademarking digital asset products and announcing a $2.5 billion Bitcoin treasury plan last week in Las Vegas. According to the CNBC report, if the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF is approved, it would represent one of “the most politically connected entries” into the already successful Bitcoin exchange-traded fund market. When writing, the TRUMP memecoin trades at $11.21, down over 84% from its all-time high of $73 reached one day after its launch.

2025-06-04T07:00:20,"TRON Activity Hits All-Time High, Is a TRX Price Breakout Coming?","TRON (TRX) is seeing a continued lift in price alongside broader gains across the crypto market. As of today, TRX is trading just above $0.27, marking a 1.2% increase over the past 24 hours. The move reflects a coordinated uptick in digital asset valuations, with the global cryptocurrency market capitalization climbing nearly 1% to a current total of approximately $3.47 trillion. This price action comes as on-chain data suggests increased user engagement on the TRON network. Related Reading: Analyst Explains Reason Behind Tron Price Sluggishness — Are TRX Bears Now In Control? According to recent analysis shared on CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, a steady rise in daily active addresses is being observed, with both the 50-day and 100-day moving averages for this metric reaching all-time highs. The sustained increase in network activity points to a potentially supportive backdrop for TRX’s current momentum. TRX Hits $121.2B Monthly Transfer Volume — New All-Time High “TRX reached a new ATH in total transfer volume, both in terms of TRX and USD value. Over the course of the month, a total of 490.3 billion TRX was transferred.” – By @JA_Maartun Full post ⤵️https://t.co/zJUt0EruNI pic.twitter.com/6yrDUUjTJb — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 2, 2025 User Engagement and Moving Averages Signal Strong Network Activity CryptoQuant contributor “CryptoOnchain” reported that the moving averages of daily active addresses on TRON have reached unprecedented levels. The 50-day and 100-day metrics, which smooth out short-term fluctuations to show longer-term engagement trends, are currently at their highest points since tracking began. Historically, sustained increases in this metric have preceded upward price movement in TRX, though the price growth has yet to fully reflect the spike in activity. The analyst also emphasized that while TRX has been rising, the network’s user participation appears to be outpacing the token’s market performance. This divergence suggests that underlying demand is building, potentially laying the groundwork for future gains if the trend continues. Meanwhile, traders often view network activity as a leading indicator of value in proof-of-stake chains like TRON, where user interaction can drive both sentiment and transaction volume. SunPump Token Activity Emerges as TRON Price Indicator In a separate CryptoQuant post, analyst “BorisVest” highlighted the role of SunPump tokens in shaping TRON’s price dynamics. SunPump is a tool used for creating tokens on the TRON network, and its activity appears to correlate with TRX market trends. According to the analysis, periods of intense token creation, often driven by hype, bots, or speculative launches, can signal short-term tops in TRX price, especially if the token’s value doesn’t keep pace with the burst in network activity. Related Reading: TRON’s Correlation With Bitcoin Could Mean Massive Gains, Here’s Why Conversely, when activity on SunPump slows down, TRX has historically drifted lower toward local bottoms, often indicating reduced selling pressure. More stable growth in token creation, when aligned with a gradual rise in TRX price, has been associated with healthier and more sustained rallies. BorisVest suggests that tracking these token dynamics can provide insights into TRON’s market rhythm, offering a potential framework for identifying accumulation zones or overheated conditions.

The XVG price may reach a potential high of about $0.34 in 2025. The future growth prospects of XVG tokens are heavily dependent on the specific project developments, market dynamics, and the broader crypto market’s trend. The Verge (XVG) token has continued to prioritize user privacy and fast transactions in the past decade of its existence. The open-source project secured through a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism has, however, faced intense competition in recent years from emerging layer one (L1) chains offering more intrinsic features to the users. Nevertheless, the Verge network offers a privacy-focused transaction, with cheap prices, which is heavily associated with widespread adoption by speculative crypto traders. If the Verge team secures successful partnerships and adopts smart contract functionality in the near future, XVG price will continue to record bullish sentiment.

2025-06-04T06:25:56,"Bitcoin Traders Are Watching These Levels for Cues on Downside Risk","Crypto markets are giving no return opportunities for intraday traders, but long-term market watchers say the market is in a coiled spot and key levels are to be monitored for moves on either side. Bitcoin BTC hovered just above $105,000 on Wednesday, showing a steady rise from earlier in the week. Ether ETH, Cardano’s ADA ADA, dogecoin DOGE and XRP XRP showed returns under 1%. Overall market capitalization declined 1.8%. Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, said the market’s shift in sentiment reflected a sense that trade tensions, and that the drag on risk assets may have been priced in. “While the U.S. economy shows signs of contraction, investors are optimistic on tech, especially on the future outlook of Bitcoin as institutions continue to integrate further with the industry,” Ruck said, adding that despite inflation risks and uncertain macro policies, the crypto market’s long-term trajectory remains positive. Bitcoin’s price action over the past week has been telling. According to data from Fineqia research analyst Matteo Greco, BTC ended last week week around $105,700, down 3.1% from the previous week’s close near $109,050. This came as BTC spot ETFs saw $150 million in net outflows in the the first negative print after six consecutive weeks of inflows. “BTC reserves on exchanges continue to decline, while reserves for major altcoins such as ETH and XRP have stabilised,” Greco wrote in an email to CoinDesk. Stablecoin reserves on exchanges have reached their highest levels in years, he added, a sign that investors may be preparing to deploy fresh capital rather than exiting the market. Greco added that bitcoin’s market-value-to-realised-value (MVRV) ratio currently stands at around 2.2, below the historical top threshold of 3.7. That suggests we’re in the late stages of the cycle — but not at the peak yet. Bitunix analysts pointed to the Fed’s dovish comments as a short-term boost to risk appetite, though they warned that dollar volatility could disrupt flows. “Bitcoin’s short-term key level is at $105,000,” they said. “If it can hold above this level, it may continue to rise. Conversely, if the market shifts back to risk aversion, the key support level at $102,700 must be defended.” As such, analysts say that if Bitcoin’s dominance begins to fade, historically a sign of late-cycle rotation, altcoins could gain momentum, marking the later innings of a bull market.

2025-06-04T06:20:36,"The California Assembly passed the Bitcoin payments bill AB 1180 with 60-0 votes","The California State Assembly unanimously passed a bill, AB 1180, on June 4 with 68 votes in favor, allowing the state government to accept Bitcoin and other digital assets as payment methods. The crypto payment bill is now under review by the state Senate. The bill requires the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) to submit a report to the Legislature on or before January 1, 2028. The report should contain the number and value of cryptocurrency transactions processed, the technical and regulatory challenges encountered, and recommendations for payments under other laws and to other state government agencies to be made using digital financial assets. According to official documents, the bill will sunset on July 1, 2031. Crypto payment bill aims to modernize state payment solutions 🇺🇸 JUST IN: California Assembly passes bill to allow the state to receive payments in Bitcoin and digital currencies. It passed 68-0, and now heads to the Senate. pic.twitter.com/3JWXlpuEWh — Bitcoin Laws (@Bitcoin_Laws) June 3, 2025 The legislation establishes the Digital Financial Assets Law (DFAL), which is a licensing and regulatory framework administered by the DFPI for digital financial asset activity. The bill also prohibits an individual from engaging in digital financial asset business activity without a license from DFPI on or after July 1, 2025. Member of the State Assembly Avelino Valencia, who presented the bill, acknowledged that it was a first-of-its-kind initiative. He noted that the AB 1180 bill would establish a pilot program authorizing the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) to allow for the payment of fees using digital finance assets. “Very excited about this. Having gone to school at San Jose State during the time that this technology was being created, I firmly believe this will be fully integrated into our society in the near future.” – Avelino Valencia , Member of the California State Assembly. Valencia championed the initiative, emphasizing its strategic importance in modernizing payment systems. Bitcoin advocate and political strategist Dennis Porter welcomed the Assembly’s move as a significant milestone in cryptocurrency acceptance in government transactions. Valencia noted that AB 1180 requires a licensee to maintain specific records related to digital financial asset business activity with a California resident for five years after the date of the transaction. It also prohibits a covered person from exchanging, transferring, or storing a stablecoin or engaging in digital financial asset administration unless the issuer of the stablecoin is a licensee, a person who applies for a license, a bank, or a California or federal trust. The legislation also provides that specified sections of the DFAL related to disclosures, consumer protections, and stablecoin requirements will be operative on July 1, 2025. According to Valencia, AB 1180 will ensure that the process and challenges of paying state fees with cryptocurrencies can be studied and improved upon. He also expects the bill to keep pace with evolving consumer preferences since Colorado, Utah, and Louisiana already accept crypto payments. Legislation faces hurdles in converting crypto to fiat We are getting a payment provider to accept crypto equivalent and deposit the dollars into the state’s treasury for that amount. It is kind of like credit card payments, with the bonus that there are no returned payments! pic.twitter.com/H8MaFV1ojE — Governor Jared Polis (@GovofCO) February 23, 2022 The California Blockchain Advocacy Coalition argued that all states accepting cryptocurrency convert it into dollars using a payment processor, which adds additional charges. The coalition noted that Colorado uses PayPal payment processing, which charges a $1 service fee to convert crypto into dollars, plus 1.83% of the payment amount, and requires the use of PayPal Currency Hub. The trade association noted that the State of California is not set up to accept digital asset payments. It also acknowledged that there is no mechanism to convert cryptocurrency payments to dollars, which is the basis of the state budget. Previous legislation allowing the use of cryptocurrency for state payments failed. The bill includes AB 953, which requires the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration to accept stablecoins for tax payments from licensed cannabis businesses. The legislation was referred to Assembly Banking and Finance and Revenue and Taxation but was gut and amended related to land use. The AB 3090 bill requires the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration to issue and deliver to the Legislature a report on how the state, cities, and counties could receive any cannabis tax amounts through stablecoin transactions but failed to go through. SB 1275 also authorizes a state agency to accept digital assets as a payment method to provide government services. The legislation failed to pass out of the Senate.
