In a Monday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said it intends to sell 2.5 million shares of its 10% Series A Stride Preferred Stock (STRD). The offering will be listed on the Nasdaq, with each share initially priced at $100, offering “institutional investors and select non-institutional investors” a 10% annual dividend yield. “Strategy intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of bitcoin and for working capital,” the company said in an official statement. The STRD offering marks Strategy’s third preferred stock issuance this year following its Strike (STRK) and Strife (STRF) offerings, in addition to its effort to raise $84 billion — a combination of both equity and debt — to fund future Bitcoin buys. STRK and STRF are convertible preferred stocks that offer a yield of 13% and 10%, respectively. Strategy is currently the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder after accumulating 580,955 BTC , currently valued at over $61 billion at current market prices. In the Monday announcement, Strategy also pointed out under what circumstances it can redeem the STRD shares. “Strategy will have the right, at its election, to redeem all, but not less than all, of the STRD stock, at any time, for cash if the total number of shares of all STRD stock then outstanding is less than 25% of the total number of shares of STRD stock originally issued in the offering and in any future offering, taken together,” it stated. Strategy’s plan of stockpiling Bitcoin has caused the company’s stock price to grow by more than double during the past year. As such, many publicly listed companies around the world have been mulling the possibility of becoming crypto treasury companies after witnessing the success of Strategy’s Bitcoin playbook. Bitcoin was recently changing hands around $106,613, a 2.4% increase over the past 24 hours, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko . Late last month, the top crypto climbed to an all-time high of almost $112,000 before erasing some of those gains.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/strategy-plans-to-raise-250-million-via-preferred-stock-sales-to-fuel-stunning-bitcoin-buying-spree/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|STRK","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|MicroStrategy",cryptocompare

Lummis stated that the US is in an economic war with China and argued that digital assets can play a strategic role in this war. “Guns, bullets, drones, planes… Yes, they are all necessary. But economic warfare is also serious. And we need to be prepared for that,” said Lummis, adding that Bitcoin should be a part of this preparation. Related News: BREAKING: Is There a Crack in Trump's Memecoin Team? Latest Wallet Move Denied by Trump's Son - What's Going On? The senator noted that some US generals, especially in Southeast Asia, think it is necessary to have a strategic Bitcoin reserve. “When you look at the leadership of the US military today, you find support for the idea of a Bitcoin reserve,” Lummis said. However, Lummis’s statements have also reignited discussions about whether there is a conflict of interest in his policy decisions. Public questions are rising about whether his son-in-law, a Bitcoin maximalist, Will Cole, is influencing the senator’s cryptocurrency policies. These discussions drew further attention with a statement made by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse on May 19. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Garlinghouse said that Lummis canceled a meeting and refused to reschedule, adding, “As a leader in Congress and a senator from the crypto-friendly state of Wyoming, I hope you will show leadership on behalf of the entire crypto industry.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-03T21:30:22,"Ethereum Price Headed For Crash To $2,000 With Current Price Action","The Ethereum price action is raising red flags among analysts, with technical indicators pointing toward a potential crash to the $2,000 level. Despite experiencing a significant uptick recently following Bitcoin’s price surge, concerns continue to grow that a deeper correction may be unfolding. Ethereum Price Crash To $2,000 Imminent Based on a new report by Master Ananda, a TradingView crypto analyst, the Ethereum market is flashing warning signs as its price struggles below the critical resistance zone. At press time, Ethereum is trading at approximately $2,605 after being rejected from a local high of around $2,788. Related Reading: Ethereum Price At $8,000: Pundit Predicts Parabolic Run For ETH Ethereum’s 4-hour chart presented by Master Ananda shows that the top altcoin has likely completed a short-term top, and now a corrective move is in play. The analysis hints at a looming price crash, with technical forecasts suggesting a retracement toward the $2,000 level or lower before the next bullish impulse. The analyst’s bearish continuation thesis appears to be a high-probability setup, with Ethereum expected to revisit lower Fibonacci retracement levels. Notably, the chart reveals a subtle bearish divergence forming as the price pushed slightly higher in May but with diminishing momentum. This, in turn, created a rising resistance line while volume and price action failed to confirm new highs. Noticeably, Ethereum’s price has since broken below the 0.230 Fibonacci level, signaling the possible start of a broader correction phase. The next probable support areas lie at $2,280 (0.382 Fib), $2,085 (0.5 Fib), and most significantly, the $1,900 price point at the 0.618 Fib Retracement level. The highlighted green zones in Master Ananda’s chart represent potential support and buying areas, which point to the $1,900 to $1,735 (0.618-0.786 Fib) range as the most likely zone for a higher low to form. The previous major low occurred on April 7, and the expectation is that this correction will end above that level. Until then, a short-term correction remains the most likely scenario, and traders are warned to take caution as the chart further highlights a possibly more resounding crash to $1,385. ETH Trade Strategy: Buy The Dip And Go Long While sharing his bearish thesis for Ethereum, Master Ananda also provided a clear strategy for investors and traders. He advised long-term holders to wait patiently for the projected drop and assess the support reaction before looking for clear reversal signals. Related Reading: Crypto Trader Dumps XRP Holdings For Ethereum, Explains Why Buying into support zones like $1,900 or even as low as $1,736 could provide optimal entry points for long-term positions. While bears may still attempt to short the market, Master Ananda assures that the downside remains limited. The analyst emphasizes the importance of planning and avoiding impulsive trading by creating ideal entry and exit points while respecting the prevailing market trend. With Ethereum’s bullish outlook still intact, this projected price crash could become an opportunity for many traders instead of a threat.

IBIT holds $68.83B in assets & 660,842 BTC, ranking as the #2 Bitcoin holder globally. Low fees and institutional trust drive IBIT’s strong lead over competitors like FBTC, GBTC. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has climbed the ranks in the exchange-traded fund (ETF) world at an incredible speed.

The flagship coin successfully rebounded from a previous weekly resistance level of around $104k and is now signaling the onset of a fresh rally. Moreover, the heavy crypto liquidations in the past few days have cooled down the leveraged market, thus setting the stage for a fresh bull run. Additionally, Bitcoin’s Futures Open Interest (OI) has gradually increased in the past two months from around $47 billion to about $71 billion on June 3, during the late-North American trading session. Whale Investors on a Shopping Spree for Bitcoin According to on-chain data analysis from Santiment , around 151,820 Bitcoin wallets holding between 10 and 10k BTCs accumulated 79,244 coins in the past week. Consequently, the cohort now holds a cumulative 13.57 million Bitcoin. As Coinpedia has reported in the past, Strategy has led more companies to adopt Bitcoin as a treasury management tool in the recent past.

Dimon said the United States should stockpile weapons, ammunition and drones instead of Bitcoin. Dimon said in his speech, “We should stockpile weapons, bullets, fighter jets, drones and rare earth elements. We all know we need to do this and there is no debate about it.” Dimon’s words were interpreted as an indirect reference to the presidential decree signed by Trump in March, which foresaw the creation of a Bitcoin reserve in the US.

JPMorgan, known for its negative attitude towards cryptocurrencies, has begun offering cryptocurrency trading services to its customers, but the company continues to be cautious in this area. According to experts, this attitude stems from the fact that concepts such as sovereign money and financial democratization contradict the traditional banking sector’s “leave your money in our hands” approach. Later in his speech, Dimon argued that the real threat to the United States comes not from outside, but from within. “My real concern is us, are we capable of rebuilding our own ethics, our own values, our own governance skills, our own inclusive power?” he said. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-03T21:02:26,"Binance Attracts $180 Billion in Stablecoin Deposits Year-to-Date","Binance is leading all centralized crypto exchanges in stablecoin reserves. According to the latest stats, the crypto exchange currently holds $31 billion in USDT and USDC, which is around 59% of total stablecoin holdings across the sector. This dominance highlights Binance’s outsized role in providing liquidity and facilitating stablecoin-denominated transactions. Stablecoin Inflows Favor Binance When assessing total crypto reserves, Coinbase tops the list with $129 billion in holdings, followed closely by Binance with $110 billion, comprising Bitcoin, ETH, USDT, and USDC, CryptoQuant data revealed. Collectively, the two exchanges have been found to control 60% of the total reserves among the top 20 centralized platforms. While Coinbase does not publicly disclose wallet-level Proof-of-Reserves (PoR), Binance distinguishes itself through on-chain reporting, including verifiable wallet addresses, which enhances its credibility in the crypto community. On the inflow front, Binance remains the top destination for stablecoins. In May alone, the exchange received $31 billion in USDT and USDC deposits, as it slightly edged out Coinbase at $30 billion. Year-to-date in 2025, Binance has attracted $180 billion in cumulative stablecoin inflows, which strengthens its role as a primary venue for capital allocation. More broadly, Coinbase and Binance lead in total crypto inflows this year, bringing in $344 billion and $335 billion, respectively. The figure is well ahead of competitors, which solidifies their continued dominance in institutional and retail capital flows. Notably, Binance also shows the highest average Bitcoin inflow per deposit, which implies that the exchange attracts large players. On May 22, when Bitcoin hit a record $112,000, Binance’s average BTC deposit surged to 7 BTC. In contrast, Bitfinex averaged 5 BTC, while OKX, Kraken, and Coinbase saw significantly lower figures at 1.23, 0.7, and 0.8 BTC, respectively, further indicating Binance’s pull among whales. Stablecoin Adoption Grows Beyond centralized exchange activity, broader stablecoin usage across the payments landscape also saw significant growth over the past two years. Between January 2023 and February 2025, stablecoin transactions reached $94.2 billion, according to analytics firm Artemis, which surveyed 20 stablecoin payment firms and included estimates from 11 others across sectors such as B2B, P2P, B2C, cards, and prefunding. Interestingly, Tron led as the top settlement network with about 60% of the volume, while Ethereum, BSC, and Polygon followed. “Overall, stablecoins have established themselves as growing and significant components of the global payment infrastructure, with expanding usage across transaction types and regions, pointing to their growing centrality in the international economic system.” The post Binance Attracts $180 Billion in Stablecoin Deposits Year-to-Date appeared first on CryptoPotato .",cryptopotato,https://cryptopotato.com/binance-attracts-180-billion-in-stablecoin-deposits-year-to-date/,"BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDC","AA News|Crypto News|Binance|Coinbase|Ethereum|Stablecoins|Tron",cryptocompare
2025-06-03T21:00:39,"Bitcoin Proponent Sets XRP Price Even If BTC Reaches $100 Million","XRP has recently drawn considerable attention following multiple ambitious forecasts regarding its long-term valuation. Supporters cite its increasing role in cross-border transactions, evolving regulatory clarity, and a rise in institutional adoption as key factors that could drive significant price growth. Several analysts have made bold projections. BarriC, a well-known crypto commentator, previously suggested that XRP could reach $100. Matthew Brienen, Chief Operating Officer at CryptoGuard, took the speculation further in April, projecting a $1,000 target for XRP. Some, like John Squire, have pushed expectations even higher, calling a $10,000 XRP valuation “conservative.” Bitcoin Maximalist Counters With Supply-Based Argument In sharp contrast, Rajat Soni, a Chartered Financial Analyst and strong proponent of Bitcoin, has dismissed such projections as unrealistic. He further argued that the circulating supply of XRP—100 billion tokens—makes such high price targets implausible. Soni compared XRP to Bitcoin, noting the latter’s capped supply of 21 million coins and divisibility into 2.1 quadrillion satoshis. Based on this structure, he concluded that one XRP equates to approximately 21,000 satoshis. When XRP was priced at $2.20, and 21,000 satoshis cost $22, Soni claimed that Bitcoin’s intrinsic value was already at least 1,000 times greater than XRP’s. According to Soni’s projections, if Bitcoin were to rise to $100 million, one satoshi would then equal $1. Using this ratio, he argued that XRP would struggle to exceed $20, as it would remain pegged to the relative value of 21,000 satoshis. He also highlighted inflationary implications. A $100 million Bitcoin, in his view, would signify a U.S. dollar devaluation of over 95%. In today’s terms, he noted, such a scenario would imply a Bitcoin value of around $5 million and an XRP equivalent of just $1 when adjusted for purchasing power. Current Market Metrics and Contradictory Performance At present, XRP is priced at $2.15, while Bitcoin trades at approximately $104,199, putting the XRP-to-BTC ratio at 0.00002053. If XRP were to reach $22 when Bitcoin is at $100 million, its ratio would decline to 0.00000020, a roughly 99% loss of value relative to Bitcoin. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 However, recent market performance does not support such a steep decline. XRP has gained 183% against Bitcoin since November 2024, contradicting the idea that it is consistently underperforming. If Bitcoin were to reach $100 million per coin, its market capitalization would rise to nearly $1.987 quadrillion. Maintaining its current dominance of 64.58%, the global crypto market cap would approach $3.076 quadrillion. Assuming XRP maintains its existing market share of 3.94% under these extreme conditions, its total market cap would climb to roughly $121.194 trillion. This would place XRP’s price near $1,244, which is a sharp contrast to Soni’s $20 limit. While predictions of XRP reaching $1,000 or more remain highly speculative, Soni’s assertion that the asset would be capped under $20 in a hyper-inflated crypto market also relies on rigid assumptions. The outcome will likely depend on future developments in utility, adoption, and macroeconomic trends, none of which can be accurately predicted with absolute certainty.

According to the report, despite Bitcoin trading at record levels and increasing institutional fund inflows, there is no significant movement in the altcoin market. According to analysts, this situation is caused by the lack of new trends in the market and the selling pressure caused by the unlocking of many tokens. Related News: How Will June Unfold for Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies? Calm or High Volatility Expected? According to 10x Research, the low liquidity environment makes it difficult to sustain the rise in altcoin prices. “The old scenario that once worked with hype and leverage is ineffective against the 4.5% US Treasury yield today,” the analysis said, noting that even Ethereum has quietly entered a period of 'staking for modest returns'. The analysis also stated that there is no need for huge capital to push the prices of altcoins up, and that a few large purchase orders can easily move the low liquidity market. However, it was stated that in order to sustain this rise, large-scale individual investor participation is required, and this is where the real problem begins. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-03T20:30:05,"Blockchain Group Increases Bitcoin Holdings with $68.7M Buy","Blockchain Group, a cryptocurrency company based in Paris, has bought more Bitcoin (BTC). Recently, the firm announced that it had purchased 624 BTC, spending $68.7 million, equivalent to 60.2 million euros. This move is part of the company’s expanding strategy to hold Bitcoin as a key treasury asset . Blockchain Group joins a growing list of companies using the flagship crypto to strengthen their balance sheets. Blockchain Group Fund BTC Buy With Share Sales The Paris-based crypto exchange revealed that it used a convertible bond sale, finalized on May 26, to fund its latest Bitcoin purchase. The sale brought in €55.3 million from Fulgur Ventures. The company used all this process from this sale to buy 544 BTC. In a statement, Blockchain Group said it is the first European company to focus on holding Bitcoin as a treasury asset and plans to keep the digital coin for the long term. Meanwhile, many businesses are doing the same to protect their money and benefit from Bitcoin’s growth. This latest investment brings the firm’s total Bitcoin holdings to 1,471 BTC. The firm’s Bitcoin investments have returned 1,097.6% year-to-date and 47.9% in the current quarter. Institutions Are Going All In on Bitcoin Blockchain Group is not alone. Around the world, more organizations are adding Bitcoin to their reserves , now viewing it as a safe-haven asset. Metaplanet, a Japanese-based tech firm, recently bought 1,088 BTC, pushing its total Bitcoin stash to 8,888 BTC. With that, Metaplanet now ranks among the top 10 global corporate Bitcoin holders, surpassing Block Inc. Metaplanet has earned significant returns from its Bitcoin plan. The company said it gained 225% this year and 66.3% in the last quarter. Its strong approach, including a recent deal to raise $50 million with zero-interest bonds bought by Evo Fund, is working well. The company’s stock price has jumped 155% in the last month, showing market confidence in its Bitcoin-heavy approach. Coinbase Offers Bitcoin Yields To Institutional Investors In the U.S., Coinbase makes it easier for institutions to earn from their Bitcoin holdings. The company has launched a Bitcoin Yield Fund designed to offer annual returns of 4% to 8%. This fund gives large investors a safer way to benefit from Bitcoin, without needing to sell it. Coinbase’s move reflects a shift in the market. More institutional players want stable, crypto-based income options. Coinbase aims to meet this rising demand by focusing on low-risk, steady returns. Bitcoin is becoming a central part of corporate finance. Firms like Blockchain Group, Metaplanet, and Coinbase are showing how Bitcoin can be more than just a speculative asset. It can also serve as a strong, long-term store of value. As more companies follow suit, the role of Bitcoin in the global economy continues to grow.

2025-06-03T20:24:52,"Texas Congressman Slammed for Delayed Bitcoin Disclosure of $500K Purchases","Congressman Brandon Gill (R-TX) is under scrutiny for allegedly improperly disclosing Bitcoin purchases of up to $500,000, according to a June 3 report from Open Secrets. Brandon Gill Under Fire for Bitcoin Disclosures According to the article , Gill made two different purchases of Bitcoin between $100,001 and $250,000 on January 29 and February 27. The report alleges that Gill failed to appropriately divulge both transactions until after a 45-day disclosure deadline required by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act (STOCK), based on a periodic transaction report signed by the freshman politician on May 30. BREAKING: A US politician has disclosed large buys in bitcoin BEFORE the US announced its creation of a Bitcoin strategic reserve. Representative Brandon Gill bought up to $850,000 of Bitcoin on 01/29/2025, 02/27/2025, 05/13/2025, and 05/18/2025.

Gill’s first Bitcoin purchase this year was made less than one week after U.S. President Donald Trump issued an executive order establishing a working group on cryptocurrency in a bid “to establish regulatory clarity for digital financial technology.” On March 6, Trump announced the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and digital asset stockpile in hopes of “positioning the United States as a leader among nations in government digital asset strategy.” Will Donald Trump’s Face Be on the $100 Bill? Gill has long touted his support for Trump, most recently introducing the Golden Age Act of 2025 in order to put Trump’s face on the $100 bill. “President Trump could be enjoying his golden years golfing and spending time with his family,” Gill said in a March 2025 statement. “Instead, he took a bullet for this country and is now working overtime to secure our border, fix our uneven trade relationship with the rest of the world, make America energy independent again, and put America first by ending useless foreign aid.” “There has been no one who has done more to bring America into the golden age than President Trump,” he added. “Featuring him on the $100 bill is a small way to honor all he will accomplish these next four years.” The post Texas Congressman Slammed for Delayed Bitcoin Disclosure of $500K Purchases appeared first on Cryptonews .",cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/texas-congressman-faces-scrutiny-over-delayed-bitcoin-disclosure/,"BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING","Blockchain News|News|Bitcoin|Texas|Trump",cryptocompare

2025-06-03T20:12:31,"Donald Trump Jr. says his family isn’t behind the new ""Trump Wallet""","Donald Trump is the name behind a new crypto wallet, but Donald Trump Jr. says his family has nothing to do with it. The project, branded as the Official $TRUMP Wallet, was promoted Tuesday in a public post by Magic Eden, in partnership with GetTrumpMemes.com. The site urges people to join a waitlist, claiming it’s the only wallet officially tied to the $TRUMP token, created by the team behind the president’s memecoin. The wallet website says: “Yes! This is The Official $TRUMP Wallet by President Trump. Magic Eden partnered with GetTrumpMemes.com to create the first and only $TRUMP Wallet. Have Fun!” That came just days after Trump hosted a private dinner for the biggest holders of his meme token — an event that raised eyebrows from critics accusing him of turning his presidency into a crypto marketing scheme. Don Jr. denies link to the wallet and focuses on stablecoin Less than an hour after the announcement, Donald Trump Jr. posted on X, writing: “The Trump Organization has zero involvement with this wallet product. Eric Trump and I know nothing about it. Stay tuned—World Liberty Financial, which we have been working tirelessly on, will be launching our official wallet soon.” In an interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box before the post, Don also made it clear: “I wasn’t involved in the meme coin. I’m more focused on the stablecoin, the bitcoin mining.” The $TRUMP token, which was launched three days before the Inauguration, has been the main coin tied to the Trump name in crypto. 80% of the supply is held by the Trump Organization and its affiliates, making it the financial center of Trump’s current crypto ventures. At its highest point, the token hit a market cap of $15 billion, but most of those gains are now gone. Even though the coin’s value dropped, its creators are still earning. Every transaction made using the $TRUMP token automatically sends a cut to the developers’ wallets. Between January and April, over $324 million in trading fees landed in wallets connected to the token’s team, according to data tracked by Chainalysis. Trump family says crypto move was driven by being ‘debanked’ Don Jr. said the move into crypto wasn’t some gimmick. He explained that the family had to look for alternatives after being shut out by banks following Trump’s entry into politics. “I could call any single banker in New York City,” he said. “They’d pick up the phone, I’d be able to get a loan for whatever real estate project I was doing across the street. Then we got into politics, and all of a sudden they wouldn’t take your call. You couldn’t get financing. We were debanked.” That’s what led to their push into crypto, and now to their focus on a stablecoin called USD1, issued by World Liberty Financial. The token is fully backed by US Treasurys, and Donald Jr. says it could help boost America’s financial dominance. “They’re literally some of the biggest buyers of US Treasurys in the world, replacing a lot of the countries that would have been traditionally doing that,” he said , pointing to Tether, which holds nearly 70% of the global stablecoin market. Tether’s own holdings include about $120 billion in US government debt, which places it above countries like Germany and the UAE as a top Treasury holder. Don Jr. added, “Stablecoins could be the savior of US currency.” The Trump family’s growing involvement in crypto, though, has drawn heat. Critics say a sitting president with financial interests in tokens creates space for corruption and foreign money to enter US politics. Donald Jr. pushed back by highlighting crypto’s anonymity. “You don’t know who’s actually doing any of these things,” he said. “It’s hard to influence if you don’t actually know where this stuff’s coming from.” That hasn’t stopped big names from getting involved. Justin Sun, founder of the Tron blockchain, increased his stake in WLFI tokens — tied to the Trump family’s stablecoin initiative — to $75 million in January. A court filing the next month revealed he and the Securities and Exchange Commission were working on settling a fraud case. Sun also bought a big chunk of the $TRUMP token, becoming one of the top holders, and bringing his total investment in Trump-tied coins to at least $97 million.

Toomey says in a new interview with CNBC that equities are still likely “range-bound,” suggesting that the S&P 500 may correct after rallying close to 6,000 points. “I think the concern we’ve got is that while we’ve taken the worst-case scenario with regards to the Liberation Day, we’re in a situation where I think the market’s right now probably pricing in the best-case scenario. I think everyone’s talking about the fact that there are probably going to be 10% tariffs across the board, 30% for China. I think that’s kind of baked in.” Toomey also warns of the potential for stagflation, an unfavorable economic environment which is dominated by stagnant economic growth, high inflation and high unemployment. The Morgan Stanley executive notes that companies with connectivity to China aren’t doing as well due to the tariffs. “You can see that in the Magnificent 7, and you can see that in the rest of the overall S&P 500. So in our minds, that’s going to be a stagflation issue. If we do see GDP growth coming down, that might give us the opportunity for the Fed to step in next year and start cutting rates.” As of Tuesday’s close, the S&P 500 is trading at 5,935 points.

2025-06-03T20:00:00,"Live Coin Watch Trending: Bitcoin Solaris Mobile Mining Revolution Creating Overnight Wealth Opportunities","In every market cycle, there’s one altcoin that flips the script—one project that doesn’t just ride the wave but rewrites the rules entirely. This season, that breakout isn’t just another meme coin or recycled Ethereum fork. It’s Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S), a radically different wealth-generation engine powered by innovation, efficiency, and most importantly, mobile mining. But this isn’t just about clever branding. It’s about making serious money, without needing to buy expensive rigs or be a technical genius. And as it dominates trending lists on platforms like Live Coin Watch, one thing is clear: early believers in Bitcoin Solaris are already seeing the first signs of overnight success. Beyond the Buzz: Why “Trending” Doesn’t Always Mean “Sustainable” Live Coin Watch tracks countless tokens that trend for a day and vanish the next. Many spike on hype and crumble on fundamentals. But Bitcoin Solaris is climbing for a different reason—it’s combining trending status with a backbone of technology that actually delivers. Where other coins struggle to balance scale, cost, and decentralization, BTC-S sets a new standard. It doesn’t just look good on a chart; it works. The Power of Mobile Mining: Wealth in Your Pocket At the center of Bitcoin Solaris’s momentum is its mobile-first approach to mining. Through the upcoming Solaris Nova app, users will be able to mine BTC-S straight from their phones, a disruptive model that opens the door to millions worldwide. This isn’t just a gimmick. BTC-S has reimagined mining by: Eliminating the barrier of expensive hardware Spreading access globally through mobile, desktop, and browser platforms Driving consistent demand by requiring holders to own BTC-S in order to mine more With this frictionless approach, the dream of passive income from crypto is no longer reserved for whales. A Blockchain Designed for You, Not Institutions—Discover BTC-S Behind the Speed: A Dual-Layer Engine Built for the Future What makes this all work under the hood is Bitcoin Solaris’s dual-layer architecture. The Base Layer runs on a hybrid of Proof of Work and Proof of Contribution, maximizing security and fairness in validator rewards. The Solaris Layer delivers blazing speed and scalability with its Delegated Proof of Stake model, finalizing transactions in just two seconds. Combined, they push the network to support over 10,000 transactions per second, making BTC-S not just fast but enterprise-grade scalable. And security? Bitcoin Solaris has been fully audited by both Cyberscope and Freshcoins , giving investors peace of mind. Community and Trust: How It’s Growing—Fast The attention isn’t limited to retail users. The buzz has caught the eye of major influencers too. A detailed review by Crypto Legends breaks down the momentum, and why many believe BTC-S could be the defining altcoin of the year. Add to that a fully KYC-verified team via Freshcoins KYC , and the foundation for long-term confidence is clear. And with over 11,000 unique users already joined, this isn’t a slow trickle—it’s a stampede. Presale Momentum: This Train Is Moving Fast This isn’t the start of the presale. It’s Phase 6. With the price currently at $6, and just a short window before it jumps to $7, momentum is building at an explosive pace. Launch price? $20. Bonus? 10%. Return potential? 1,900%. Time left? Only around 8 weeks. It’s already raised over $1.8M, making it one of the shortest and most explosive presales in the market. The door is closing fast—and those getting in now could be looking at one of the biggest multipliers this year. Roadmap: Built for the Long Haul Beyond the headlines and hype, Bitcoin Solaris is structured for years of innovation. Its roadmap includes: Launch of the Solaris Nova app in Phase 4 Mining Power Marketplace and DApp Accelerator in Phase 5 Layer-2 scaling and a new DEX by Phase 6 Fortune 500 partnerships and enterprise tools by Phase 7 Government collaborations and global education by 2028+ This isn’t a pump-and-dump. It’s a long-term digital economy in motion. Conclusion: The Opportunity to Mine, Earn, and Hold the Future While other altcoins chase the spotlight, Bitcoin Solaris is building something much bigger—a truly decentralized, scalable, and accessible wealth-generation platform. Its mobile-first mining model and dual-consensus framework make it more than just a trending token. It’s a blueprint for financial empowerment. And in a world where attention shifts quickly, Bitcoin Solaris is proving that sustainable innovation can trend—and keep trending—for all the right reasons.

In a new interview with CNBC, Donald J. Trump Jr., son of U.S. President Donald J. Trump, says the family got into crypto after being “ debanked ” in New York City for political reasons. “The reason we got into crypto and we’re all in on crypto and we’re doing American Bitcoin and we have World Liberty Finance and USD1 was because there was a time… where I could call any single banker in New York City, they’d pick up the phone [and] I’d be able to get a loan for whatever real estate project I was doing across the street. Then we got into politics, and all of a sudden, they wouldn’t take your call. You couldn’t get financing. We were debanked. And what I realized, and my brother realized because we were the recipients of every subpoena imaginable, was that, you know what? We were just the top of this sort of pyramid scheme that we didn’t realize we were a part of, that the financial system was totally undemocratized because we had a certain balance sheet…” After experiencing what the family believes was a political persecution, he says that the Trumps decided to turn to crypto as a way to avoid being “turned off” in the future. “The regular guy was messed up. Now we were all of a sudden in the shoes of the regular guy that wouldn’t be able to take advantage of the markets. And we said, what’s the solution for that? The answer is crypto. These decentralized platforms where you’re not beholden to this, where you create efficiencies. As a guy that did real estate, [I asked] why am I paying points in and out for title insurance? That could be done on the blockchain. So we got into crypto not because it was like, ‘hey, this is the next cool thing.’ We got into it out of necessity. We got into it because we understood just how quickly we could be turned off.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-03T19:48:07,"Is the Altcoin Season Upon Us? Analysis Firm Responds with Two Metrics","Cryptocurrency analytics firm Alphractal has suggested that the altcoin market could enter a strong bullish wave in the near future. The company highlighted two key indicators to assess this possibility: Altcoin Dominance Excluding Stablecoins and Altcoin Dominance Excluding Stablecoins with Ethereum. According to Alphractal’s analysis, altcoin dominance, excluding stablecoins, has historically found strong support at the 25% level. This rate usually indicates periods when altcoins lose significant value during periods when Bitcoin and stablecoins dominate the market. However, analysts believe that periods when this dominance rate fluctuates between 24% and 25.3% are followed by altcoin seasons, which usually last for a few weeks. Related News: South Korea, a Country Influencing the Crypto Sector, Has Announced the Winner of Its Presidential Election - Here Are His Cryptocurrency Opinions When Ethereum is excluded, the picture changes slightly. Noting that Ethereum plays a critical role in altcoin dominance, Alphractal states that the historical support level of this metric is around 18%. The fact that it has fallen below this level only a few times in the past coincides with periods when Bitcoin was rapidly losing market share to altcoins. The company also acknowledges that these support levels alone do not guarantee an upcoming altcoin season. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Is the Altcoin Season Upon Us?

Here’s Why","In a striking commentary that has sparked renewed debate in the crypto space, market observer Amonyx has urged investors to convert their Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other altcoins, dismissively referred to as “shitcoins” into XRP , warning that time is running out. Amonyx made this assertion while referencing a viral post by analyst Jacob King, who alleges that a shadowy $4 billion Bitcoin transfer by Tether to Jack Mallers’ newly launched firm, Twenty One Capital, may be the latest red flag in what he calls a fabricated market ecosystem. Tether’s Dubious Bitcoin Transfer Sparks Alarm At the center of the controversy is a massive transaction involving 37,229 BTC, worth nearly $4 billion, moved by Tether to Twenty One Capital just a day after the company launched. According to King, the timing and scale of this transfer raise serious concerns about the legitimacy of the demand for Bitcoin. “Nobody was buying,” King stated bluntly, implying that without Tether’s interference, organic interest in Bitcoin is virtually nonexistent. REMINDER: Time is running out to convert your $ETH , $BTC , and all other shitcoins into $XRP . https://t.co/1FWn7qyvG4 — Amonyx (@amonbuy) June 3, 2025 This sudden liquidity injection is seen by critics not as an investment decision, but rather as an attempt to simulate demand and support artificially high prices. King argues that the Bitcoin market is being propped up by a single centralized entity, likening it to a house of cards destined to collapse once the illusion of liquidity is exposed. Jack Mallers’ Risky Venture Draws Comparisons to Collapsed Schemes What further intensifies the scrutiny is Mallers’ announcement of a new lending service under Twenty One Capital, a move that critics argue echoes the playbooks of defunct platforms like Celsius and Bitconnect. These notorious projects lured investors with promises of high returns through lending models, only to implode under the weight of insolvency and mismanagement. For Amonyx and others raising the alarm, Mallers’ pivot into lending, so soon after receiving billions in BTC from Tether, is a glaring red flag. “Avoid at all cost,” King warned, suggesting that the scheme will inevitably go bust. The parallels with past crypto collapses are unsettling, with King calling this episode “the most elaborate financial fraud in history” and predicting its unraveling will be “nothing short of spectacular.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP as a Safer Alternative Amid Systemic Risks Against this backdrop of escalating skepticism surrounding Bitcoin and Ethereum, Amonyx is championing XRP as a superior and more transparent alternative. The digital asset, developed by Ripple Labs, has long positioned itself as a bridge currency for cross-border payments and has recently gained renewed institutional interest following partial legal clarity in the U.S. courts. XRP’s resilience amid regulatory uncertainty and its focus on real-world utility make it, according to Amonyx, a safer bet as the rest of the market faces increasing scrutiny and potential collapse. While BTC and ETH are criticized for their speculative bubbles and lack of clear use cases, XRP’s alignment with global financial infrastructure continues to gain traction, especially with growing partnerships across Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America. A Turning Point for the Crypto Market? The warning from Amonyx is not isolated. It reflects a growing disillusionment within parts of the crypto community who are questioning the sustainability of the existing market structure. The latest revelations only intensify the demand for greater transparency and decentralized accountability. As trust in some of the market’s most dominant assets begins to erode, XRP appears to be emerging as a potential beneficiary of the shift. Whether or not investors will heed the call to convert their holdings before what Amonyx calls the impending collapse remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: the market is approaching a critical juncture, and the decisions made in this moment may shape the future of crypto for years to come.

CoreWeave (CRWV), one of the hottest players in the AI sphere, is up 23% on the day to a new record and higher by more than 270% since it went public in March.

2025-06-03T19:09:07,"Where is Bitcoin Headed Next? Here Are the Levels to Watch for a Potential Rally","Cryptocurrency analysis platform MakroVision has published a remarkable assessment of Bitcoin's recent price movements. The analysis noted that Bitcoin reached a new all-time high by rising to $112,000, and then entered a technically healthy correction process. MakroVision emphasized that the 61.8% Fibonacci resistance at $111,260 initially turned the price back, but this pullback is currently limited to around 5%. There are no signs of a sharp decline in the downward movement at the moment. Experts note that Bitcoin has found strong support at the following technical levels: $103,200: The 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level is currently holding successfully. $102,000: This level, which previously acted as resistance, is now a potential support area. $97,700: Coinciding with the 38.2% Fibonacci level, this area forms a strong support cluster along with $98,600. Related News: BREAKING: After Remaining Silent for a Long Time, Trump Makes His Move in Cryptocurrencies! And He's Not Stopping There—He's Partnering with a Surprise Altcoin According to MakroVision’s analysis, Bitcoin retesting $112,000 would reaffirm the market’s strength, with $121,100 the next target if this level is breached. However, in terms of downside risks, it is emphasized that Bitcoin is still structurally in an uptrend as long as it does not fall below $97,700. *This is not investment advice.
