2025-06-03T22:56:59,"Bitcoin: Strategic 10.5K BTC Transfer by Tether Fuels SoftBank’s Investment","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: Strategic 10.5K BTC Transfer by Tether Fuels SoftBank’s Investment A significant move is underway in the world of cryptocurrency, highlighting growing institutional interest and strategic partnerships. Tether, the company behind the popular USDT stablecoin, is making headlines with a substantial Bitcoin transfer. This action is directly linked to a major Crypto Investment by global tech giant SoftBank, signaling confidence in the digital asset space and specific firms within it. What’s Happening with This Significant Bitcoin Transfer? Tether Group CEO Paolo Ardoino recently announced via X that the company is transferring 10,500 Bitcoin (BTC) to a specific wallet address. This isn’t just a routine transaction; it’s part of a larger, strategic financial maneuver. The transfer is designated as pre-funding for SoftBank’s previously announced investment in the Bitcoin investment firm, Twenty One Capital (XXI). Let’s break down the key elements: Amount: 10,500 BTC (a considerable sum given current market values). Sender: Tether Group. Recipient: A wallet address starting with bc1qpz, linked to the investment structure. Purpose: Pre-funding SoftBank’s investment in Twenty One Capital . This move underscores the interconnectedness of major players in the crypto and traditional finance sectors. Understanding the Key Players: Tether, SoftBank, and Twenty One Capital This transaction involves several prominent entities, each playing a crucial role in the evolving landscape of finance and technology. Tether: Best known for USDT, the largest stablecoin by market capitalization. Tether plays a vital role in providing liquidity and stability within the crypto ecosystem. Their involvement in this Crypto Investment highlights their expanding influence beyond stablecoin issuance into strategic asset management and partnerships. SoftBank: A massive Japanese multinational conglomerate holding company with significant investments in technology, telecommunications, and finance globally. SoftBank’s decision to invest in a Bitcoin -focused firm like Twenty One Capital is a strong indicator of increasing institutional adoption and belief in the long-term value of digital assets. Twenty One Capital (XXI): A firm specializing in Bitcoin investments. While perhaps less widely known than SoftBank or Tether, attracting investment from such major players positions XXI for significant growth and prominence in the Bitcoin investment space. The investment round in Twenty One Capital also includes other notable participants like Bitfinex (a major cryptocurrency exchange closely associated with Tether) and Cantor Fitzgerald (a global financial services firm). This consortium of investors brings together diverse expertise from crypto infrastructure, traditional finance, and global investment, creating a powerful synergy for XXI. Why is SoftBank Investing in Twenty One Capital? SoftBank’s investment in Twenty One Capital , facilitated by this large Bitcoin transfer from Tether, speaks volumes about the maturation of the crypto market. Traditional finance giants are no longer just observing; they are actively participating and investing in firms that specialize in digital assets like Bitcoin . Reasons for such an investment often include: Exposure to Bitcoin: Gaining indirect or direct exposure to the performance of Bitcoin through a specialized fund or firm. Growth Potential: Believing in the significant growth potential of the digital asset market and firms positioned to capitalize on it. Diversification: Adding digital assets to a diversified investment portfolio. Strategic Partnerships: Building relationships with key players in the crypto space like Tether and Bitfinex. The fact that Tether is handling the pre-funding in Bitcoin itself is particularly interesting. It suggests that the investment structure involves the direct use of BTC as an asset, rather than solely fiat currency, further embedding digital assets into the investment mechanism. Implications of This Crypto Investment This move has several potential implications for the market and the involved parties: Validation for Twenty One Capital: Receiving investment from SoftBank, Tether, Bitfinex, and Cantor Fitzgerald provides significant validation and credibility for XXI. Increased Institutional Confidence: A major player like SoftBank making a direct investment in a Bitcoin firm via a structured deal involving Tether can boost confidence among other institutional investors considering entering the space. Potential Market Impact: While the transfer itself is internal to the investment structure, the news of SoftBank’s investment and Tether’s role could positively influence market sentiment towards Bitcoin and related investment vehicles. Evolution of Tether’s Role: Tether’s participation in facilitating such investments highlights its growing role as a key financial entity within the broader digital asset ecosystem, extending beyond stablecoin operations. This transaction is more than just a large transfer of Bitcoin ; it’s a clear signal of increasing convergence between traditional finance and the crypto world, with major players like SoftBank and Tether leading the charge in facilitating significant Crypto Investment . What Does This Mean for the Future? The collaboration between SoftBank, Tether , Bitfinex, Cantor Fitzgerald, and Twenty One Capital points towards a future where large-scale institutional participation in Bitcoin and other digital assets becomes increasingly common. As more traditional finance firms and tech giants allocate capital to this sector, it could lead to greater market stability, liquidity, and mainstream acceptance. This specific instance provides a concrete example of how complex, multi-party investments involving digital assets are being structured and executed. It demonstrates confidence not only in Bitcoin as an asset class but also in the infrastructure and firms operating within the crypto ecosystem. While challenges remain, such as regulatory clarity and market volatility, strategic investments like this one from SoftBank, facilitated by Tether’s Bitcoin transfer to Twenty One Capital , lay the groundwork for broader adoption and integration of digital assets into the global financial system. In conclusion, Tether’s transfer of 10,500 Bitcoin is a pivotal step in executing SoftBank’s strategic investment in Twenty One Capital . This collaboration between titans of tech, finance, and crypto underscores the growing significance of Bitcoin and the digital asset space in global investment strategies, marking a notable moment in the ongoing institutional embrace of crypto.

2025-06-03T22:42:53,"Wall Street’s next trillion dollar market could grow 10 times by 2030, analysts say","Wall Street firms are now betting that stablecoins will grow more than tenfold by 2030, hitting between $3 trillion and $4 trillion, according to a report from Citizens JMP Securities. The current market cap sits at $225 billion, but firms like Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and others are watching the space closely as new rules come into play and more institutions enter the scene. Devin Ryan, head of financial technology research at Citizens JMP, said they expect stablecoins to open up almost $100 billion in annual revenue for issuers. “Even as interest rates normalize off our $3 trillion estimate, we project a nearly $100 billion revenue opportunity for issuers, which for some will represent incremental fees while for others will be necessary to offset lower transaction fees,” he wrote . Banks, tech firms, and Congress push stablecoin adoption Devin explained that major players from different industries are now entering what he called a post-regulatory ‘land grab’, now that the path is clearer under the Trump administration. The White House has been rolling back Biden-era crypto policies, and Ryan believes that’s fueling new interest from traditional finance. Congress is also expected to pass the GENIUS Act — a bill focused on stablecoin legislation — as early as August 2025. At the same time, new regulatory systems are popping up around the world. Europe’s MiCA law is already active, while Singapore and others are building their own frameworks. The hope is that clearer rules will drive up global adoption and encourage more institutional use of stablecoins outside just trading. Citigroup’s Alex Saunders added more fuel to the forecast in a note on May 30, saying stablecoins could reach between $1.6 trillion and $3.7 trillion by 2030. Alex said the coins are being used as more than just bridge tokens in crypto. “There’s a case to be made for stablecoins as an alternative store of value or a hedge against inflation and political volatility,” Alex wrote. That’s especially true in countries facing currency issues or economic instability. Stablecoins link remittances, US debt demand, and digital payments Devin also said that stablecoins are now useful in everyday finance, things like remittances, business payments, and e-commerce. He pointed out their growing role in tokenized financial markets and said they offer a practical store of value in economies hit by inflation. On top of that, they might boost US debt demand. “Critically for the United States … we estimate the US could see a multi-trillion structural bid for its debt — supporting liquidity and reinforcing monetary leadership,” Devin wrote. Treasury Bills are already used to back many stablecoins, so more demand for these tokens means more demand for US bonds. Alex echoed that point, saying, “The US dollar’s reserve currency status is likely to be reflected in, rather than driven by, relative currency stablecoin issuance.” Both analysts agree that the growth of stablecoins could help keep the dollar strong globally. Meanwhile, the broader crypto market is also showing signs of strength, with Bitcoin staying well above $105,000 as of press time. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones jumped over 200 points — a 0.5% gain — marking four straight days in the green. The S&P 500 went up by 0.6%, and the Nasdaq rose by 0.8%, helped by tech stocks. Nvidia rose by nearly 3%, briefly pushing past Microsoft to become the world’s most valuable public company, yet again. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-06-03T22:42:49,"Breaking: President Donald Trump’s Truth Social Files for Spot BTC ETF","The post Breaking: President Donald Trump’s Truth Social Files for Spot BTC ETF appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Truth Social, a social media platform backed by the United States President Donald Trump, has filed for a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the U.S. SEC. According to a recent SEC filing, the Truth Social seeks to list and trade shares of the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF on the NYSE Arca Exchange. The Truth Social Bitcoin ETF will be managed by Foris DAX Trust Company, LLC, whereby investors will only be allowed cash settlement. The filing of the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF follows a recent move by the Trump Media and Technology Group to raise $2.5B to implement a Bitcoin treasury management plan. Truth Social Affirms High Bitcoin Demand from Institutional Investors The filing of the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF aligns with the cryptocurrency agenda of the U.S. President Donald Trump. Furthermore, the Trump Organization and the Official Trump Meme ($TRUMP) have played a crucial role in the mainstream adoption of digital assets. The overall demand for Bitcoin by institutional investors as a hedge against inflation and macroeconomic uncertainty remains high. According to market data analysis from BitcoinTreasuries , 223 entities now hold more than 3.39 million BTCs as part of their treasury management strategy. Is BTC Price Ready to Moon? As Coinpedia reported , the rising demand for Bitcoin from institutional investors has helped increase bullish sentiment. The recent weekly rebound from a crucial support/resistance level around $104k is a clear indication that BTC price is preparing for a fresh rally towards a new all-time high. However, a consistent close below $103,336 in the coming days will further delay an anticipated parabolic rally.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/breaking-president-donald-trumps-truth-social-files-for-spot-btc-etf/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Bitcoin|Bitcoin ETF|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations",cryptocompare
2025-06-03T22:40:06,"Jacobi BCOIN ETF could become the first Bitcoin ETF in Europe","Assets management firm Jacobi will now offer its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) to European retail investors. The move follows regulatory approval by the Guernsey Financial Service Commission. According to an announcement from the firm, the Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF (BCOIN) , launched in 2023 on Euronext Amsterdam, will no longer be restricted to professional and institutional investors, with regulators now deeming it safe enough for retail. It said: “Retail investors, subject to the rules of their respective national regulators, can now access the Jacobi Bitcoin ETF via regulated brokerage and investment platforms.” The firm stated that this will increase accessibility to the product, which is in line with its mission to provide secure exposure to digital assets. With nearly two years of regulatory oversight as an institutional-grade product, removing the barriers is expected to boost its appeal. Meanwhile, the announcement noted that removing the restrictions on who can invest and the minimum investment amount is due to Bitcoin’s evolution over the past few years, making the once-niche cryptocurrency a mainstream asset. Jacobi BCOIN ETF could become the first Bitcoin ETF in Europe Interestingly, the Jacobi-issued BCOIN could become the first Bitcoin ETF to trade in Europe. While several issuers, including CoinShares and Bitwise, have issued physical Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) , there is no ETF for crypto assets. This is due to the Undertaking for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) framework, which does not allow funds with only one component. Despite the difference in nomenclature and framework, crypto ETPs in Europe are similar to the spot crypto ETFs in the US. CoinShares physical Bitcoin ETP and Bitwise Bitcoin ETP dominate the market with €1.499 billion and €1.198 billion, respectively. With BCOIN entering the scene, it hopes to attract investors’ interest in a sector with over 100 crypto ETP products. This could prove challenging given that even BlackRock IBIT ETP has only around €260 million. Presently, Jacobi BCOIN has around $1.9 million in assets under management. Meanwhile, Jacobi CEO Peter Lane praised Gurnsey’s approach to regulating the digital assets sector while adding that the firm is excited to make the Bitcoin ETF accessible in eligible countries. He said: “We applaud Guernsey as an innovative jurisdiction who have embraced the evolution of digital assets and look forward to bringing more innovative, digital asset products to market with robust regulatory oversight.” To secure approval, the UK-based asset manager worked with other firms, including Sigma Asset Management, Collas Crill, and Midshore Consulting. Guernsey is a dependency of the United Kingdom. Experts say BlackRock IBIT could finish 2025 with over 1 million BTC by 2026 ending While Jacobi is looking to attract investors to BCOIN ETF, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have seen sizable outflows for three consecutive days since May 29 as BTC price appears to be consolidating after the recent rally. According to Farside Investors data , spot Bitcoin ETFs have bled $1.23 billion over the past three days, with BlackRock IBIT alone seeing $561.4 million in outflows in the past two days. Despite the massive outflows, BlackRock IBIT remains a top performer and is expected to hit a new high soon. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has predicted that BlackRock could become the biggest holder of Bitcoin by the end of next year, surpassing Satoshi, who has 1.123 million BTC. He said: “After only 16 months on the market, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) is the second-biggest holder of the token and on pace to pass Satoshi as the world’s largest by the end of 2026. IBIT has bought almost $50 billion worth of Bitcoin.” Unsurprisingly, IBIT is already the youngest ETF to be in the top 25 ETFs by value in over a decade, with over $70 billion in AUM, which is enough to rank it 23rd among the top ETFs.

In a Monday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said it intends to sell 2.5 million shares of its 10% Series A Stride Preferred Stock (STRD). The offering will be listed on the Nasdaq, with each share initially priced at $100, offering “institutional investors and select non-institutional investors” a 10% annual dividend yield. “Strategy intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of bitcoin and for working capital,” the company said in an official statement. The STRD offering marks Strategy’s third preferred stock issuance this year following its Strike (STRK) and Strife (STRF) offerings, in addition to its effort to raise $84 billion — a combination of both equity and debt — to fund future Bitcoin buys. STRK and STRF are convertible preferred stocks that offer a yield of 13% and 10%, respectively. Strategy is currently the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder after accumulating 580,955 BTC , currently valued at over $61 billion at current market prices. In the Monday announcement, Strategy also pointed out under what circumstances it can redeem the STRD shares. “Strategy will have the right, at its election, to redeem all, but not less than all, of the STRD stock, at any time, for cash if the total number of shares of all STRD stock then outstanding is less than 25% of the total number of shares of STRD stock originally issued in the offering and in any future offering, taken together,” it stated. Strategy’s plan of stockpiling Bitcoin has caused the company’s stock price to grow by more than double during the past year. As such, many publicly listed companies around the world have been mulling the possibility of becoming crypto treasury companies after witnessing the success of Strategy’s Bitcoin playbook. Bitcoin was recently changing hands around $106,613, a 2.4% increase over the past 24 hours, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko .

Lummis stated that the US is in an economic war with China and argued that digital assets can play a strategic role in this war. “Guns, bullets, drones, planes… Yes, they are all necessary. But economic warfare is also serious. And we need to be prepared for that,” said Lummis, adding that Bitcoin should be a part of this preparation. Related News: BREAKING: Is There a Crack in Trump's Memecoin Team? Latest Wallet Move Denied by Trump's Son - What's Going On? The senator noted that some US generals, especially in Southeast Asia, think it is necessary to have a strategic Bitcoin reserve. “When you look at the leadership of the US military today, you find support for the idea of a Bitcoin reserve,” Lummis said. However, Lummis’s statements have also reignited discussions about whether there is a conflict of interest in his policy decisions. Public questions are rising about whether his son-in-law, a Bitcoin maximalist, Will Cole, is influencing the senator’s cryptocurrency policies. These discussions drew further attention with a statement made by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse on May 19. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Garlinghouse said that Lummis canceled a meeting and refused to reschedule, adding, “As a leader in Congress and a senator from the crypto-friendly state of Wyoming, I hope you will show leadership on behalf of the entire crypto industry.” *This is not investment advice.

Despite experiencing a significant uptick recently following Bitcoin’s price surge, concerns continue to grow that a deeper correction may be unfolding. Ethereum Price Crash To $2,000 Imminent Based on a new report by Master Ananda, a TradingView crypto analyst, the Ethereum market is flashing warning signs as its price struggles below the critical resistance zone. At press time, Ethereum is trading at approximately $2,605 after being rejected from a local high of around $2,788. Related Reading: Ethereum Price At $8,000: Pundit Predicts Parabolic Run For ETH Ethereum’s 4-hour chart presented by Master Ananda shows that the top altcoin has likely completed a short-term top, and now a corrective move is in play. The analysis hints at a looming price crash, with technical forecasts suggesting a retracement toward the $2,000 level or lower before the next bullish impulse. The analyst’s bearish continuation thesis appears to be a high-probability setup, with Ethereum expected to revisit lower Fibonacci retracement levels. Notably, the chart reveals a subtle bearish divergence forming as the price pushed slightly higher in May but with diminishing momentum. This, in turn, created a rising resistance line while volume and price action failed to confirm new highs. Noticeably, Ethereum’s price has since broken below the 0.230 Fibonacci level, signaling the possible start of a broader correction phase. The next probable support areas lie at $2,280 (0.382 Fib), $2,085 (0.5 Fib), and most significantly, the $1,900 price point at the 0.618 Fib Retracement level. The highlighted green zones in Master Ananda’s chart represent potential support and buying areas, which point to the $1,900 to $1,735 (0.618-0.786 Fib) range as the most likely zone for a higher low to form. The previous major low occurred on April 7, and the expectation is that this correction will end above that level. Until then, a short-term correction remains the most likely scenario, and traders are warned to take caution as the chart further highlights a possibly more resounding crash to $1,385. ETH Trade Strategy: Buy The Dip And Go Long While sharing his bearish thesis for Ethereum, Master Ananda also provided a clear strategy for investors and traders. He advised long-term holders to wait patiently for the projected drop and assess the support reaction before looking for clear reversal signals. Related Reading: Crypto Trader Dumps XRP Holdings For Ethereum, Explains Why Buying into support zones like $1,900 or even as low as $1,736 could provide optimal entry points for long-term positions. While bears may still attempt to short the market, Master Ananda assures that the downside remains limited. The analyst emphasizes the importance of planning and avoiding impulsive trading by creating ideal entry and exit points while respecting the prevailing market trend. With Ethereum’s bullish outlook still intact, this projected price crash could become an opportunity for many traders instead of a threat.

IBIT holds $68.83B in assets & 660,842 BTC, ranking as the #2 Bitcoin holder globally. Low fees and institutional trust drive IBIT’s strong lead over competitors like FBTC, GBTC. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has climbed the ranks in the exchange-traded fund (ETF) world at an incredible speed. Just 1.4 years into its launch and IBIT has already landed a spot among the top 25 largest ETFs globally when measured by assets.

The flagship coin successfully rebounded from a previous weekly resistance level of around $104k and is now signaling the onset of a fresh rally. Moreover, the heavy crypto liquidations in the past few days have cooled down the leveraged market, thus setting the stage for a fresh bull run. Additionally, Bitcoin’s Futures Open Interest (OI) has gradually increased in the past two months from around $47 billion to about $71 billion on June 3, during the late-North American trading session. Whale Investors on a Shopping Spree for Bitcoin According to on-chain data analysis from Santiment , around 151,820 Bitcoin wallets holding between 10 and 10k BTCs accumulated 79,244 coins in the past week. Consequently, the cohort now holds a cumulative 13.57 million Bitcoin. As Coinpedia has reported in the past, Strategy has led more companies to adopt Bitcoin as a treasury management tool in the recent past. For instance, Reitar Logtech plans to raise $1.5 Billion to acquire BTC for its corporate treasury. What Next for BTC Price Bitcoin price has favored bullish sentiment in the past few weeks following the positive developments of the tariffs negotiations led by the United States.

Dimon said the United States should stockpile weapons, ammunition and drones instead of Bitcoin. Dimon said in his speech, “We should stockpile weapons, bullets, fighter jets, drones and rare earth elements. We all know we need to do this and there is no debate about it.” Dimon’s words were interpreted as an indirect reference to the presidential decree signed by Trump in March, which foresaw the creation of a Bitcoin reserve in the US.

JPMorgan, known for its negative attitude towards cryptocurrencies, has begun offering cryptocurrency trading services to its customers, but the company continues to be cautious in this area. According to experts, this attitude stems from the fact that concepts such as sovereign money and financial democratization contradict the traditional banking sector’s “leave your money in our hands” approach. Later in his speech, Dimon argued that the real threat to the United States comes not from outside, but from within. “My real concern is us, are we capable of rebuilding our own ethics, our own values, our own governance skills, our own inclusive power?” he said. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-03T21:02:26,"Binance Attracts $180 Billion in Stablecoin Deposits Year-to-Date","Binance is leading all centralized crypto exchanges in stablecoin reserves. According to the latest stats, the crypto exchange currently holds $31 billion in USDT and USDC, which is around 59% of total stablecoin holdings across the sector. This dominance highlights Binance’s outsized role in providing liquidity and facilitating stablecoin-denominated transactions. Stablecoin Inflows Favor Binance When assessing total crypto reserves, Coinbase tops the list with $129 billion in holdings, followed closely by Binance with $110 billion, comprising Bitcoin, ETH, USDT, and USDC, CryptoQuant data revealed. Collectively, the two exchanges have been found to control 60% of the total reserves among the top 20 centralized platforms. While Coinbase does not publicly disclose wallet-level Proof-of-Reserves (PoR), Binance distinguishes itself through on-chain reporting, including verifiable wallet addresses, which enhances its credibility in the crypto community. On the inflow front, Binance remains the top destination for stablecoins. In May alone, the exchange received $31 billion in USDT and USDC deposits, as it slightly edged out Coinbase at $30 billion. Year-to-date in 2025, Binance has attracted $180 billion in cumulative stablecoin inflows, which strengthens its role as a primary venue for capital allocation. More broadly, Coinbase and Binance lead in total crypto inflows this year, bringing in $344 billion and $335 billion, respectively. The figure is well ahead of competitors, which solidifies their continued dominance in institutional and retail capital flows. Notably, Binance also shows the highest average Bitcoin inflow per deposit, which implies that the exchange attracts large players. On May 22, when Bitcoin hit a record $112,000, Binance’s average BTC deposit surged to 7 BTC. In contrast, Bitfinex averaged 5 BTC, while OKX, Kraken, and Coinbase saw significantly lower figures at 1.23, 0.7, and 0.8 BTC, respectively, further indicating Binance’s pull among whales. Stablecoin Adoption Grows Beyond centralized exchange activity, broader stablecoin usage across the payments landscape also saw significant growth over the past two years. Between January 2023 and February 2025, stablecoin transactions reached $94.2 billion, according to analytics firm Artemis, which surveyed 20 stablecoin payment firms and included estimates from 11 others across sectors such as B2B, P2P, B2C, cards, and prefunding. Interestingly, Tron led as the top settlement network with about 60% of the volume, while Ethereum, BSC, and Polygon followed. “Overall, stablecoins have established themselves as growing and significant components of the global payment infrastructure, with expanding usage across transaction types and regions, pointing to their growing centrality in the international economic system.” The post Binance Attracts $180 Billion in Stablecoin Deposits Year-to-Date appeared first on CryptoPotato .",cryptopotato,https://cryptopotato.com/binance-attracts-180-billion-in-stablecoin-deposits-year-to-date/,"BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDC","AA News|Crypto News|Binance|Coinbase|Ethereum|Stablecoins|Tron",cryptocompare
2025-06-03T21:00:39,"Bitcoin Proponent Sets XRP Price Even If BTC Reaches $100 Million","XRP has recently drawn considerable attention following multiple ambitious forecasts regarding its long-term valuation. Supporters cite its increasing role in cross-border transactions, evolving regulatory clarity, and a rise in institutional adoption as key factors that could drive significant price growth. Several analysts have made bold projections. BarriC, a well-known crypto commentator, previously suggested that XRP could reach $100. Matthew Brienen, Chief Operating Officer at CryptoGuard, took the speculation further in April, projecting a $1,000 target for XRP. Some, like John Squire, have pushed expectations even higher, calling a $10,000 XRP valuation “conservative.” Bitcoin Maximalist Counters With Supply-Based Argument In sharp contrast, Rajat Soni, a Chartered Financial Analyst and strong proponent of Bitcoin, has dismissed such projections as unrealistic. He further argued that the circulating supply of XRP—100 billion tokens—makes such high price targets implausible. Soni compared XRP to Bitcoin, noting the latter’s capped supply of 21 million coins and divisibility into 2.1 quadrillion satoshis. Based on this structure, he concluded that one XRP equates to approximately 21,000 satoshis. When XRP was priced at $2.20, and 21,000 satoshis cost $22, Soni claimed that Bitcoin’s intrinsic value was already at least 1,000 times greater than XRP’s. According to Soni’s projections, if Bitcoin were to rise to $100 million, one satoshi would then equal $1. Using this ratio, he argued that XRP would struggle to exceed $20, as it would remain pegged to the relative value of 21,000 satoshis. He also highlighted inflationary implications. A $100 million Bitcoin, in his view, would signify a U.S. dollar devaluation of over 95%. In today’s terms, he noted, such a scenario would imply a Bitcoin value of around $5 million and an XRP equivalent of just $1 when adjusted for purchasing power. Current Market Metrics and Contradictory Performance At present, XRP is priced at $2.15, while Bitcoin trades at approximately $104,199, putting the XRP-to-BTC ratio at 0.00002053. If XRP were to reach $22 when Bitcoin is at $100 million, its ratio would decline to 0.00000020, a roughly 99% loss of value relative to Bitcoin. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 However, recent market performance does not support such a steep decline. XRP has gained 183% against Bitcoin since November 2024, contradicting the idea that it is consistently underperforming. If Bitcoin were to reach $100 million per coin, its market capitalization would rise to nearly $1.987 quadrillion. Maintaining its current dominance of 64.58%, the global crypto market cap would approach $3.076 quadrillion. Assuming XRP maintains its existing market share of 3.94% under these extreme conditions, its total market cap would climb to roughly $121.194 trillion. This would place XRP’s price near $1,244, which is a sharp contrast to Soni’s $20 limit. While predictions of XRP reaching $1,000 or more remain highly speculative, Soni’s assertion that the asset would be capped under $20 in a hyper-inflated crypto market also relies on rigid assumptions. The outcome will likely depend on future developments in utility, adoption, and macroeconomic trends, none of which can be accurately predicted with absolute certainty.

Analysts Explain the Real Reason","Evaluating the latest developments in the cryptocurrency markets, 10x Research revealed the main reasons why the altcoin season has not started in its published analysis. According to the report, despite Bitcoin trading at record levels and increasing institutional fund inflows, there is no significant movement in the altcoin market. According to analysts, this situation is caused by the lack of new trends in the market and the selling pressure caused by the unlocking of many tokens. Related News: How Will June Unfold for Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies? Calm or High Volatility Expected? According to 10x Research, the low liquidity environment makes it difficult to sustain the rise in altcoin prices. “The old scenario that once worked with hype and leverage is ineffective against the 4.5% US Treasury yield today,” the analysis said, noting that even Ethereum has quietly entered a period of 'staking for modest returns'. The analysis also stated that there is no need for huge capital to push the prices of altcoins up, and that a few large purchase orders can easily move the low liquidity market. However, it was stated that in order to sustain this rise, large-scale individual investor participation is required, and this is where the real problem begins. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-03T20:55:47,"BCP Technologies has launched tGBP, a British pound-backed stablecoin","BCP Technologies said it has launched its own British pound-backed stablecoin called tGBP. While many companies, such as Tether and poundtoken, have tried and failed to launch a successful British pound-backed stablecoin, BCP Technologies is going for gold with its newly launched stablecoin, tGBP. BCP Technologies introduces its tGBP British pound stablecoin BCP Technologies, a cryptocurrency firm registered in the United Kingdom, said it has launched a new British pound-backed stablecoin, Tokenised GBP (tGBP). The firm said it has approval from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority ( FCA ), and it announced the launch on June 3, 2025, in a statement. The tGBP stablecoin is now available for purchase to customers who successfully pass the KYC verification on BCP Technologies’ crypto trading platform, BCP Markets. According to the company, the stablecoin will soon be listed on multiple major cryptocurrency exchanges, with two major listings currently in advanced stages of negotiation. “There are two large exchanges that we are finalising details with. We are hoping to be able to announce these in the following weeks,” BCP Technologies’ CEO, Benoit Marzouk, said. The stablecoin was launched after an intensive 14-month submission process through the FCA Connect portal, and a one-month pilot run in the FCA regulatory sandbox, which is a controlled environment that allows firms to test innovative products with real consumers under regulatory supervision. GBP stablecoins are in short supply The tGBP stablecoin is built as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain and is backed on a 1:1 basis with British pounds held in segregated bank accounts. According to the company, this structure ensures both transparency and stability. “BCP proposes in the future to back tGBP with short-term UK government bonds, in line with the FCA discussion paper,” Marzouk told Cointelegraph. BCP Technologies, formerly BitcoinPoint, has undergone a transformation since it became an FCA-registered crypto asset service provider in 2021. “Historically, it was a platform ‘BitcoinPoint’ to democratise access to Bitcoin, where anyone could buy Bitcoin easily,” Marzouk explained. With the introduction of new regulations in 2020, the firm shifted from its cash-based services to a fully digital platform. With tGBP, individuals and businesses can hold the coin directly in their wallets as an alternative to traditional bank accounts. Like popular USD stablecoins such as USDT and USDC, coin offers an efficient way to send funds across borders and bypasses traditional banking delays and fees. Financial institutions can use tGBP as collateral in crypto-native lending and settlement processes, and the token is designed to facilitate settlements for tokenized real-world assets like securities, bonds, or real estate. “Our vision is to abstract the complexity of blockchain with the familiarity of a GBP denomination, ultimately replacing GBP e-money with our GBP stablecoin,” Marzouk said in the company’s announcement. According to data from CoinGecko , only two British pound stablecoins, VNX British Pound (VGBP) and Celo British Pound (CGBP), are currently tracked. Together, they both have a market capitalization of under $500,000. Other projects like poundtoken (GBPT), which was launched by Blackfridge in 2022, and GBPA, developed by Agant, also exist but have yet to see meaningful adoption. Even Tether , the issuer of the world’s most widely used stablecoin (USDT), failed to make a significant impact with its British pound offering launched in 2022.

2025-06-03T20:30:08,"Altcoin Market Cap Flashes A Bullish Cross – Is The Next Altseason Brewing?","Bitcoin continues to dominate a major part of the broader crypto market over altcoins as the flagship asset displays strength and resilience, indicated by its notable price performance above the $100,000 mark. However, these non-BTC assets seem primed to make waves once again as the alt market cap makes a crucial move, hinting at a bullish reversal. An Impending Shift Toward The Upside For Altcoins After a period of sideways movements, altcoins appear to be gearing up for a positive move. Presently, alts are glimmering with newfound optimism as the general market cap of altcoins makes a key bullish cross, suggesting a potential rebound. Ted Pillows, a seasoned market expert and investor, spotted the cross following his examination of alts market cap on the daily time frame chart. The cross identified by the market expert is a Golden Cross, which is an indication of growing upside momentum. A Golden Cross typically unfolds when a short-term moving average crosses over a long-term moving average. Furthermore, it is a technical signal that suggests a possible shift in market trend, particularly from a negative to a positive trend. With the golden cross appearing on the alt market cap, a signal often considered as a potential catalyst for significant price gains, it implies robust resilience from the non-BTC assets during a period of bearish pressure. The emergence of the cross is likely to usher in a fresh wave of rallies for altcoins as they begin to show strength for an upward move. While a golden cross has emerged, Pillows highlighted that alt market cap has been consolidating above the 50 and 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) since May. A consolidation above these EMAs may seem worrying, but it is usually considered a signal for underlying strength that could materialize into a notable upside move in the near future. According to the expert, alts would witness remarkable bullish movements once this posture starts to move upward, which implies that the ongoing consolidation phase is just a calm before the storm . Altseason Becoming Highly Probable As the alt market cap makes a golden cross, this further increases the possibility of an impending altcoin season . On-chain expert and verified author Joao Wedson previously revealed that the market is entering a period where many alts are no longer following Bitcoin’s path. This decoupling from Bitcoin’s price trajectory seems to have increased the likelihood of an altseason as the expert foresees a bullish phase for the assets. Despite BTC hovering near record highs, Wedson noted that most alts have little room left to drop, except for some of the top market-cap coins. Such a development typically indicates a phase where capital starts shifting into non-BTC assets . Thus far, Wedon has warned investors about holding BTC and stablecoins during this period as he claims that an altcoin season is inevitable this cycle.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/altcoin-market-cap-bullish-cross/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Altcoins|Altcoin|altcoin news|Altcoin Season|altcoins|Altcoins news|alts|EMA|Exponential Moving Average|golden cross|Joao Wedson|Ted Pillows",cryptocompare

2025-06-03T20:30:05,"Blockchain Group Increases Bitcoin Holdings with $68.7M Buy","Blockchain Group, a cryptocurrency company based in Paris, has bought more Bitcoin (BTC). Recently, the firm announced that it had purchased 624 BTC, spending $68.7 million, equivalent to 60.2 million euros. This move is part of the company’s expanding strategy to hold Bitcoin as a key treasury asset . Blockchain Group joins a growing list of companies using the flagship crypto to strengthen their balance sheets. Blockchain Group Fund BTC Buy With Share Sales The Paris-based crypto exchange revealed that it used a convertible bond sale, finalized on May 26, to fund its latest Bitcoin purchase. The sale brought in €55.3 million from Fulgur Ventures. The company used all this process from this sale to buy 544 BTC. In a statement, Blockchain Group said it is the first European company to focus on holding Bitcoin as a treasury asset and plans to keep the digital coin for the long term. Meanwhile, many businesses are doing the same to protect their money and benefit from Bitcoin’s growth. This latest investment brings the firm’s total Bitcoin holdings to 1,471 BTC. The firm’s Bitcoin investments have returned 1,097.6% year-to-date and 47.9% in the current quarter. Institutions Are Going All In on Bitcoin Blockchain Group is not alone. Around the world, more organizations are adding Bitcoin to their reserves , now viewing it as a safe-haven asset. Metaplanet, a Japanese-based tech firm, recently bought 1,088 BTC, pushing its total Bitcoin stash to 8,888 BTC. With that, Metaplanet now ranks among the top 10 global corporate Bitcoin holders, surpassing Block Inc. Metaplanet has earned significant returns from its Bitcoin plan. The company said it gained 225% this year and 66.3% in the last quarter. Its strong approach, including a recent deal to raise $50 million with zero-interest bonds bought by Evo Fund, is working well. The company’s stock price has jumped 155% in the last month, showing market confidence in its Bitcoin-heavy approach. Coinbase Offers Bitcoin Yields To Institutional Investors In the U.S., Coinbase makes it easier for institutions to earn from their Bitcoin holdings. The company has launched a Bitcoin Yield Fund designed to offer annual returns of 4% to 8%. This fund gives large investors a safer way to benefit from Bitcoin, without needing to sell it. Coinbase’s move reflects a shift in the market. More institutional players want stable, crypto-based income options. Coinbase aims to meet this rising demand by focusing on low-risk, steady returns. Bitcoin is becoming a central part of corporate finance. Firms like Blockchain Group, Metaplanet, and Coinbase are showing how Bitcoin can be more than just a speculative asset. It can also serve as a strong, long-term store of value. As more companies follow suit, the role of Bitcoin in the global economy continues to grow.

Representative Brandon Gill bought up to $850,000 of Bitcoin on 01/29/2025, 02/27/2025, 05/13/2025, and 05/18/2025. He is on the Committee on… pic.twitter.com/AuuH0nHYeY — unusual_whales (@unusual_whales) June 2, 2025 Signed into law in 2012, the STOCK Act is intended to prevent members of Congress from committing insider trading. Gill’s first Bitcoin purchase this year was made less than one week after U.S. President Donald Trump issued an executive order establishing a working group on cryptocurrency in a bid “to establish regulatory clarity for digital financial technology.” On March 6, Trump announced the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and digital asset stockpile in hopes of “positioning the United States as a leader among nations in government digital asset strategy.” Will Donald Trump’s Face Be on the $100 Bill? Gill has long touted his support for Trump, most recently introducing the Golden Age Act of 2025 in order to put Trump’s face on the $100 bill. “President Trump could be enjoying his golden years golfing and spending time with his family,” Gill said in a March 2025 statement. “Instead, he took a bullet for this country and is now working overtime to secure our border, fix our uneven trade relationship with the rest of the world, make America energy independent again, and put America first by ending useless foreign aid.” “There has been no one who has done more to bring America into the golden age than President Trump,” he added. “Featuring him on the $100 bill is a small way to honor all he will accomplish these next four years.” The post Texas Congressman Slammed for Delayed Bitcoin Disclosure of $500K Purchases appeared first on Cryptonews .",cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/texas-congressman-faces-scrutiny-over-delayed-bitcoin-disclosure/,"BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING","Blockchain News|News|Bitcoin|Texas|Trump",cryptocompare

2025-06-03T20:12:31,"Donald Trump Jr. says his family isn’t behind the new ""Trump Wallet""","Donald Trump is the name behind a new crypto wallet, but Donald Trump Jr. says his family has nothing to do with it. The project, branded as the Official $TRUMP Wallet, was promoted Tuesday in a public post by Magic Eden, in partnership with GetTrumpMemes.com. The site urges people to join a waitlist, claiming it’s the only wallet officially tied to the $TRUMP token, created by the team behind the president’s memecoin. The wallet website says: “Yes! This is The Official $TRUMP Wallet by President Trump. Magic Eden partnered with GetTrumpMemes.com to create the first and only $TRUMP Wallet. Have Fun!” That came just days after Trump hosted a private dinner for the biggest holders of his meme token — an event that raised eyebrows from critics accusing him of turning his presidency into a crypto marketing scheme. Don Jr. denies link to the wallet and focuses on stablecoin Less than an hour after the announcement, Donald Trump Jr. posted on X, writing: “The Trump Organization has zero involvement with this wallet product. Eric Trump and I know nothing about it. Stay tuned—World Liberty Financial, which we have been working tirelessly on, will be launching our official wallet soon.” In an interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box before the post, Don also made it clear: “I wasn’t involved in the meme coin. I’m more focused on the stablecoin, the bitcoin mining.” The $TRUMP token, which was launched three days before the Inauguration, has been the main coin tied to the Trump name in crypto. 80% of the supply is held by the Trump Organization and its affiliates, making it the financial center of Trump’s current crypto ventures. At its highest point, the token hit a market cap of $15 billion, but most of those gains are now gone. Even though the coin’s value dropped, its creators are still earning. Every transaction made using the $TRUMP token automatically sends a cut to the developers’ wallets. Between January and April, over $324 million in trading fees landed in wallets connected to the token’s team, according to data tracked by Chainalysis. Trump family says crypto move was driven by being ‘debanked’ Don Jr. said the move into crypto wasn’t some gimmick. He explained that the family had to look for alternatives after being shut out by banks following Trump’s entry into politics. “I could call any single banker in New York City,” he said. “They’d pick up the phone, I’d be able to get a loan for whatever real estate project I was doing across the street. Then we got into politics, and all of a sudden they wouldn’t take your call. You couldn’t get financing. We were debanked.” That’s what led to their push into crypto, and now to their focus on a stablecoin called USD1, issued by World Liberty Financial. The token is fully backed by US Treasurys, and Donald Jr. says it could help boost America’s financial dominance. “They’re literally some of the biggest buyers of US Treasurys in the world, replacing a lot of the countries that would have been traditionally doing that,” he said , pointing to Tether, which holds nearly 70% of the global stablecoin market. Tether’s own holdings include about $120 billion in US government debt, which places it above countries like Germany and the UAE as a top Treasury holder. Don Jr. added, “Stablecoins could be the savior of US currency.” The Trump family’s growing involvement in crypto, though, has drawn heat. Critics say a sitting president with financial interests in tokens creates space for corruption and foreign money to enter US politics. Donald Jr. pushed back by highlighting crypto’s anonymity. “You don’t know who’s actually doing any of these things,” he said. “It’s hard to influence if you don’t actually know where this stuff’s coming from.” That hasn’t stopped big names from getting involved. Justin Sun, founder of the Tron blockchain, increased his stake in WLFI tokens — tied to the Trump family’s stablecoin initiative — to $75 million in January. A court filing the next month revealed he and the Securities and Exchange Commission were working on settling a fraud case. Sun also bought a big chunk of the $TRUMP token, becoming one of the top holders, and bringing his total investment in Trump-tied coins to at least $97 million.

Toomey says in a new interview with CNBC that equities are still likely “range-bound,” suggesting that the S&P 500 may correct after rallying close to 6,000 points. “I think the concern we’ve got is that while we’ve taken the worst-case scenario with regards to the Liberation Day, we’re in a situation where I think the market’s right now probably pricing in the best-case scenario. I think everyone’s talking about the fact that there are probably going to be 10% tariffs across the board, 30% for China. I think that’s kind of baked in.” Toomey also warns of the potential for stagflation, an unfavorable economic environment which is dominated by stagnant economic growth, high inflation and high unemployment. The Morgan Stanley executive notes that companies with connectivity to China aren’t doing as well due to the tariffs. “You can see that in the Magnificent 7, and you can see that in the rest of the overall S&P 500. So in our minds, that’s going to be a stagflation issue. If we do see GDP growth coming down, that might give us the opportunity for the Fed to step in next year and start cutting rates.” As of Tuesday’s close, the S&P 500 is trading at 5,935 points.

2025-06-03T20:00:00,"Live Coin Watch Trending: Bitcoin Solaris Mobile Mining Revolution Creating Overnight Wealth Opportunities","In every market cycle, there’s one altcoin that flips the script—one project that doesn’t just ride the wave but rewrites the rules entirely. This season, that breakout isn’t just another meme coin or recycled Ethereum fork. It’s Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S), a radically different wealth-generation engine powered by innovation, efficiency, and most importantly, mobile mining. But this isn’t just about clever branding. It’s about making serious money, without needing to buy expensive rigs or be a technical genius. And as it dominates trending lists on platforms like Live Coin Watch, one thing is clear: early believers in Bitcoin Solaris are already seeing the first signs of overnight success. Beyond the Buzz: Why “Trending” Doesn’t Always Mean “Sustainable” Live Coin Watch tracks countless tokens that trend for a day and vanish the next. Many spike on hype and crumble on fundamentals. But Bitcoin Solaris is climbing for a different reason—it’s combining trending status with a backbone of technology that actually delivers. Where other coins struggle to balance scale, cost, and decentralization, BTC-S sets a new standard. It doesn’t just look good on a chart; it works. The Power of Mobile Mining: Wealth in Your Pocket At the center of Bitcoin Solaris’s momentum is its mobile-first approach to mining. Through the upcoming Solaris Nova app, users will be able to mine BTC-S straight from their phones, a disruptive model that opens the door to millions worldwide. This isn’t just a gimmick. BTC-S has reimagined mining by: Eliminating the barrier of expensive hardware Spreading access globally through mobile, desktop, and browser platforms Driving consistent demand by requiring holders to own BTC-S in order to mine more With this frictionless approach, the dream of passive income from crypto is no longer reserved for whales. A Blockchain Designed for You, Not Institutions—Discover BTC-S Behind the Speed: A Dual-Layer Engine Built for the Future What makes this all work under the hood is Bitcoin Solaris’s dual-layer architecture. The Base Layer runs on a hybrid of Proof of Work and Proof of Contribution, maximizing security and fairness in validator rewards. The Solaris Layer delivers blazing speed and scalability with its Delegated Proof of Stake model, finalizing transactions in just two seconds. Combined, they push the network to support over 10,000 transactions per second, making BTC-S not just fast but enterprise-grade scalable. And security? Bitcoin Solaris has been fully audited by both Cyberscope and Freshcoins , giving investors peace of mind. Community and Trust: How It’s Growing—Fast The attention isn’t limited to retail users. The buzz has caught the eye of major influencers too. A detailed review by Crypto Legends breaks down the momentum, and why many believe BTC-S could be the defining altcoin of the year. Add to that a fully KYC-verified team via Freshcoins KYC , and the foundation for long-term confidence is clear. And with over 11,000 unique users already joined, this isn’t a slow trickle—it’s a stampede. Presale Momentum: This Train Is Moving Fast This isn’t the start of the presale. It’s Phase 6. With the price currently at $6, and just a short window before it jumps to $7, momentum is building at an explosive pace. Launch price? $20. Bonus? 10%. Return potential? 1,900%. Time left? Only around 8 weeks. It’s already raised over $1.8M, making it one of the shortest and most explosive presales in the market. The door is closing fast—and those getting in now could be looking at one of the biggest multipliers this year. Roadmap: Built for the Long Haul Beyond the headlines and hype, Bitcoin Solaris is structured for years of innovation. Its roadmap includes: Launch of the Solaris Nova app in Phase 4 Mining Power Marketplace and DApp Accelerator in Phase 5 Layer-2 scaling and a new DEX by Phase 6 Fortune 500 partnerships and enterprise tools by Phase 7 Government collaborations and global education by 2028+ This isn’t a pump-and-dump. It’s a long-term digital economy in motion. Conclusion: The Opportunity to Mine, Earn, and Hold the Future While other altcoins chase the spotlight, Bitcoin Solaris is building something much bigger—a truly decentralized, scalable, and accessible wealth-generation platform. Its mobile-first mining model and dual-consensus framework make it more than just a trending token. It’s a blueprint for financial empowerment. And in a world where attention shifts quickly, Bitcoin Solaris is proving that sustainable innovation can trend—and keep trending—for all the right reasons.
