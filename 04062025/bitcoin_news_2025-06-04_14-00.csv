2025-06-04T11:51:07,"Best AI Cryptos to Buy as Meta Turns to Nuclear Energy for AI Innovations","Meta has signed a 20-year deal to power its AI with nuclear energy from Illinois, locking in 1.1 gigawatts for clearer, more reliable infrastructure. Meanwhile, former Microsoft engineers Karim Jouini and Jihed Othmani are back in the AI scene with Thunder Code. The tech-savvy software testing platform has already secured $9M in seed funding. With visionary founders upping their AI stances and investors pouring significant capital into the space, it’s clear that machine learning tech is more than just a fleeting trend. Now is a prime time to capitalize on the hype; you can do precisely that by investing in the best AI cryptos – and for less than a dollar. Meta to Source Nuclear Energy for AI in 2027 Meta’s latest AI plans are already out in the open. However, it won’t start sourcing nuclear energy from Constellation’s Clinton Clean Energy Center in southern Illinois for its AI initiatives until 2027. Besides supporting its AI tech and long-term clean energy goals, Meta believes the partnership will preserve over 1.1K jobs and generate $13.5M in annual tax revenue – without using state emission credits or extra ratepayer funding. The tech giant has already seen the benefits of machine learning firsthand, integrating it into Facebook and Instagram. Both platforms will also reportedly utilize AI to automate ad creation by this year’s end. Meta isn’t alone in ramping up its AI efforts. After selling their expense management startup Expensya to Sweden’s Medius for $120M, Jouini and Othmani are back in the AI space with Thunder Code . At Expensya, the duo embraced AI to streamline expense reporting, scanning receipts, auto-categorize spending, and flag policy violations. Now, with Thunder Code, they’re raising the bar by building AI agents that mimic testers and fast-track bug detection. Armed with $9M in funding, they already have the backing to modernize software testing. As tech giants pour big bucks into AI, early investments in the best AI cryptos – SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) , Flock.io ($FLOCK) and MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – could pay off alongside increased adoption. 1. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) – Combines AI & Crypto to Boost Creators, Influences & Fans SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is a utility token that powers an innovative content creation platform combining AI and crypto.

Meanwhile, influencer perks include a personal AI assistant that manages and automate their engagements. By cutting out third-parties, they can scale their brand with less overhead and keep more of their earnings. Fans benefit, too. They gain direct access to their favorite creators, plus tailored content experience and exclusive material. So, whether you’re a creator looking to streamline your workflow, an influencer aiming to boost earnings, or a fan seeking deeper connections, the SUBBD ecosystem offers a little something for everyone. You can buy $SUBBD on presale for just $0.055575. It’s anticipated to reach $0.301 this year, offering early buyers a potential 441% gain. 2. Flock.io ($FLOCK) – Democratizes AI & Jumps Over 267% in Just One Month $FLOCK is making waves as the foundation of Flock.io, a platform on a mission to democratize AI.

Additionally, the coin can be used for transactions, facilitating the buying and selling of trained AI models and related services, thereby driving further economic activity within the platform. $FLOCK is available on some of the best crypto exchanges for just $0.2579, including MEXC and BingX . 3. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – AI Agent Coin Spikes 68% Following DEX & CoinMarketCap Listings MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is quickly emerging as the next crypto to explode , having raised over $12.7M during its presale. Yesterday, it launched on Uniswap, CoinMarketCap, and CoinGecko, which spurred it to spike 68%+ to $0.002216 . What attracts eyes to the token is that it powers MIND, an AI agent that reshapes how you discover trends and interact with market intelligence around the clock. MIND operates autonomously, scanning platforms like X, engaging with influence, and shaping conversations around trending tokens and narratives. After purchasing $MIND, you’ll receive the AI agent’s insights exclusively. On June 6, you’ll also be able to access its discoveries on MIND Terminal, its upcoming token-gated dashboard. $MIND holders get the full scoop. However, occasional updates are also shared publicly to its X account and Telegram community. The AI agent shows no signs of slowing down. It’s pushing forward with advanced system tools – persona-trained large language models (LLMs) and vector embeddings – to cover next-gen alpha. This is especially true when considering that MIND of Pepe’s liquidity is locked , which highlights the team’s commitment to long-term growth. In fact, the entire AI market is advancing at full speed, with forecasts projecting a 19% CAGR through 2028. With a modest $0.002389 price tag yet a sizable $244.37M market cap, $MIND offers a rare low-cap entry point into a booming sector. Verdict – The Best AI Cryptos Open New Horizons As dominant tech leaders ramp up their AI efforts, the broader ecosystem is moving at breakneck speed. This wave of institutional belief and builder activity makes one thing clear: AI isn’t a fad but the foundation of tomorrow’s tech. For savvy investors, early exposure to the best AI cryptos – $SUBBD , $FLOCK, and $MIND – might offer significant upside as adoption deepens. With use cases spanning AI content creation, decentralized model training, and real-time trend discovery, they redefine what’s possible in the AI-crypto arena.

2025-06-04T11:50:18,"Ethereum ETF Inflows Soar: US Spot Funds See $109 Million Boost","BitcoinWorld Ethereum ETF Inflows Soar: US Spot Funds See $109 Million Boost The world of cryptocurrency is constantly buzzing, and recent developments surrounding US spot Ethereum ETF products have captured significant attention. These new investment vehicles, designed to offer investors direct exposure to the price of Ethereum (ETH) without requiring them to hold the underlying asset, are starting to show their potential impact on the market. What’s Driving the Surge in Ethereum ETF Inflows? On June 3, Ethereum ETF inflows hit a notable milestone, with US spot funds recording a combined net inflow of $109.26 million. This wasn’t just a one-off event; it marked the twelfth consecutive trading day where these ETFs saw more money coming in than going out. This sustained interest signals growing confidence and adoption from investors, potentially including institutions, looking for regulated ways to access the second-largest cryptocurrency. Several factors could be contributing to this trend: Regulatory Clarity: The recent approval process for these ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has provided a level of regulatory clarity that was previously lacking for direct crypto investments. Institutional Interest: ETFs are familiar structures for large financial institutions and traditional investors. The availability of spot Ethereum ETFs opens the door for these entities to allocate capital to ETH more easily. Market Sentiment: Positive sentiment around Ethereum’s technological advancements, including its transition to Proof-of-Stake and ongoing network upgrades, may be attracting investment. Diversification: Investors may see ETH as a valuable addition to a diversified investment portfolio, distinct from Bitcoin or traditional assets. Which ETH ETF Products Are Leading the Pack? While several issuers have launched ETH ETF products, some are clearly attracting more capital than others. The inflows on June 3 highlight the early leaders in this nascent market: BlackRock’s ETHA: Dominating the inflows for the day, BlackRock’s offering saw a significant $76.89 million pour in. BlackRock’s vast reach and reputation in traditional finance likely play a key role in attracting substantial investment. Fidelity’s FETH: Another major financial player, Fidelity’s ETH ETF secured the second spot with $20.97 million in net inflows. Fidelity has also been active in the crypto space, building trust with investors. Grayscale’s mini ETH: Grayscale, known for its large Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), saw its ‘mini’ version attract $8.41 million. The ‘mini’ structure is designed to offer a potentially more fee-competitive option compared to its larger counterpart. Franklin Templeton’s EZET: Rounding out the top contributors for the day was Franklin Templeton’s ETF with $2.99 million in net inflows. It’s worth noting that other approved Ethereum ETFs reported no change in their holdings on this specific day, indicating that the inflows were concentrated among a few key players initially. What Does This Mean for the Ethereum Price? Increased Ethereum ETF inflows are generally viewed as a positive catalyst for the Ethereum price . When ETFs experience net inflows, it means the fund managers are buying ETH on the open market to back the shares being purchased by investors. This direct buying pressure adds demand for Ethereum, which can potentially lead to price appreciation, assuming other market factors remain constant or are also positive. While $109.26 million is a significant figure for a single day, the long-term impact will depend on the sustainability and scale of these inflows over weeks and months. Comparing this to the early days of US spot Bitcoin ETFs, which saw billions of dollars in inflows relatively quickly (though also experienced outflows from Grayscale’s converted trust), provides some context. Consistent, large-scale inflows into Ethereum ETFs could become a major driver for ETH’s valuation. How Do Ethereum ETF Inflows Fit into the Broader Crypto Market? The successful launch and subsequent inflows into US spot Ethereum ETF products are a significant development for the entire crypto market . It signals the continued maturation and institutional acceptance of digital assets beyond just Bitcoin. As more traditional investors gain exposure to Ethereum through these regulated products, it could increase overall liquidity and stability in the ETH market. Furthermore, the performance and success of Ethereum ETFs could pave the way for ETFs based on other cryptocurrencies in the future, assuming regulatory environments become more favorable. This expanding ecosystem of regulated crypto investment products could attract a new wave of capital into the digital asset space. Looking Ahead: The Potential Impact of Sustained Inflows The initial data showing twelve consecutive days of net inflows, culminating in the $109.26 million day on June 3, is an encouraging start for US spot Ethereum ETFs. While it’s still early days, sustained inflows could have several positive implications: Increased institutional participation in Ethereum. Greater legitimacy and public awareness of ETH as an asset class. Potential positive pressure on the Ethereum price due to increased demand. Further development of the infrastructure supporting crypto investments. However, investors should also remain mindful of potential volatility inherent in the crypto market and the fact that ETF inflows can fluctuate based on market sentiment and macroeconomic factors. Conclusion: A Positive Start for US Spot Ethereum ETFs The data from June 3 provides clear evidence that US spot Ethereum ETFs are beginning to gain traction with investors. The significant inflows, particularly into funds managed by major players like BlackRock and Fidelity, underscore the growing appetite for regulated access to Ethereum. While the long-term trajectory remains to be seen, this strong start suggests that these ETFs could become an important bridge between traditional finance and the dynamic world of Ethereum, potentially influencing the Ethereum price and the broader crypto market in the months and years to come.

2025-06-04T11:50:15,"Crypto Supporter Lee Jae-myung Sworn in as South Korea’s New President","South Korea’s new president, Lee Jae-myung , has officially taken office, sparking hope for a more progressive and crypto-friendly policy direction in the country. Representing the center-left Democratic Party, he secured over 49% of the votes, defeating conservative rival Kim Moon-soo by an 8% margin, according to near-final data from the National Election Commission on June 4. The special election came just six months after former President Yoon Suk-yeol imposed martial law, triggering widespread unrest and a call for fresh leadership. With nearly 80% of the country’s 44.4 million eligible voters casting their ballots, this year’s turnout marks the highest in a South Korean presidential election since 1997. The result was celebrated as a strong mandate for change, with a focus on modernizing the financial system, rebuilding trust in governance, and embracing new technologies, particularly in the crypto space. Crypto at the Core of Lee’s Campaign Promises Lee’s victory has drawn global attention for his progressive stance on digital assets. Throughout his campaign, Lee pledged to allow South Korea’s $884 billion national pension fund to invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. He also supported the introduction of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), a move that could significantly enhance crypto market legitimacy and participation within the country. Additionally, Lee proposed the launch of a Korean Won-backed stablecoin to stem capital outflows and increase domestic financial innovation. “We need to establish a won-backed stablecoin market to prevent national wealth from leaking overseas,” he said during a policy forum in May. His opponent, Kim Moon-soo, also expressed support for expanding the crypto sector, though Lee’s broader and more detailed plans appear to have resonated more with voters. Economic Recovery and Institutional Reforms Following the election news, Bitcoin prices briefly surged to 149 million Korean won (approximately $108,480) on major Korean exchanges such as Bithumb and Upbit — a near 2% premium over global averages — indicating strong domestic enthusiasm for crypto. While crypto was a key theme of the new president’s campaign, he faces broader economic and political challenges ahead. In his first public address after the election, Lee emphasized the need for immediate economic recovery, a depoliticized judicial system, and institutional reform. He also promised to introduce a four-and-a-half-day work week, boost AI and defense investments, and prevent any recurrence of military takeovers.

In a note to investors, Goldman Sachs says hedge funds bought global equities last week at the quickest pace since November 2024, some seven months ago, reports Reuters. The buying spree comes as stock markets ended the month with their strongest May performance in decades. The S&P 500 (SPX), for example, increased over 6% in May, the largest monthly increase since November 2023, and the best performance for the month of May since 1990. Goldman Sachs says hedge funds closed the week being bullish in every global region, with North America and European markets seeing the most interest. Hedge funds were most aggressive in the technology sector, buying the largest weekly number of net long positions in tech companies in over five years. The buying was concentrated on firms involved in the artificial intelligence industry, including semiconductor manufacturers, technology hardware producers and electrical equipment companies. North American tech companies were favored by hedge fund trades, followed by European tech firms. The stocks global hedge funds bought up in the European sector also included consumer discretionary, financial, health care and communications companies.

2025-06-04T11:30:00,"California Bitcoin Payments: Assembly Passes Historic Bill for State Crypto Acceptance","BitcoinWorld California Bitcoin Payments: Assembly Passes Historic Bill for State Crypto Acceptance A significant development is unfolding in the Golden State that could reshape how residents interact with government services. California, a global hub for technological innovation, is taking a bold step towards embracing digital currencies. The California State Assembly has given its stamp of approval to a bill that proposes allowing state agencies to accept Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital assets for various services and fees. This move towards facilitating California Bitcoin payments signals a growing recognition of cryptocurrency within traditional financial systems. Understanding the California Bitcoin Bill What exactly does this Bitcoin bill California is considering entail? At its core, the proposed legislation aims to establish a framework for state entities to accept cryptocurrencies as a legitimate form of payment. According to reports, including updates from sources like Bitcoin Laws on X, the bill sailed through the State Assembly with unanimous support, a strong indicator of cross-party interest in exploring this new frontier. Here’s a breakdown of the key aspects: Purpose: To enable state agencies to accept digital currencies, including Bitcoin, for government services, permits, licenses, and fees. Scope: Applies to payments made to state entities, potentially streamlining transactions for citizens and businesses. Status: Passed the California State Assembly unanimously. Next Step: The bill now moves to the California State Senate for further debate and consideration. This is not yet law; it’s a crucial step in the legislative process. The Senate’s review and potential amendments will be critical in shaping the final version of the bill. Why is Government Crypto Adoption Gaining Traction? The push for government crypto adoption isn’t happening in a vacuum. Governments globally are exploring how digital assets and blockchain technology can improve efficiency, transparency, and accessibility. For California, embracing crypto payments could offer several potential benefits: Modernization: Aligning state payment systems with modern technological trends and the growing digital economy. Efficiency: Potentially reducing transaction times and administrative overhead associated with traditional payment methods. Accessibility: Providing an alternative payment rail for individuals and businesses who hold or prefer to use cryptocurrencies. Innovation Hub: Reinforcing California’s reputation as a leader in technology and innovation by actively engaging with emerging financial technologies. Reduced Fees: Depending on the implementation model, it could potentially lower transaction costs compared to credit card processing fees for the state. This legislative effort reflects a broader trend of integrating digital assets into mainstream finance and public services. It acknowledges the increasing prevalence of cryptocurrencies and seeks to provide a legal and operational pathway for their use in state transactions. How Would the State Accept Crypto Payments in Practice? Implementing a system where the State accept crypto payments involves more than just flipping a switch. There are significant technical, operational, and regulatory considerations. While the bill’s specifics will be fleshed out in the Senate, the likely model involves utilizing third-party payment processors. Here’s a potential workflow: A resident or business chooses to pay a state fee using cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin). They initiate the payment through a designated state portal or system. The system interfaces with a contracted third-party crypto payment processor. The processor receives the cryptocurrency from the user. Immediately, the processor converts the cryptocurrency into U.S. dollars at the current market rate. The processor remits the U.S. dollar amount to the state agency. This ‘instant conversion’ model is crucial for mitigating the volatility risk associated with cryptocurrencies. The state receives stable U.S. dollars, while the user gets the convenience of paying with crypto. This is a common approach seen in businesses that accept crypto payments. However, challenges remain, including: Selecting and integrating reliable processors: Ensuring security, compliance, and efficiency. Ensuring regulatory clarity: Navigating state and federal regulations regarding digital assets. Public education: Informing residents and businesses how to use the new payment option. Security: Protecting against fraud and cyber threats in the payment process. What Does California Bitcoin Payments Mean for the Future? The passage of this bill through the Assembly sets a powerful precedent. Should it become law, the ability to make California Bitcoin payments for government services could significantly boost the legitimacy and mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. It signals that a major U.S. state is willing to integrate digital assets into its financial infrastructure. This could pave the way for: Other states considering similar legislation. Increased demand for businesses to handle crypto transactions. Greater public familiarity and comfort with using cryptocurrencies for everyday transactions. It’s a step that moves beyond simple recognition of crypto as an asset class and towards its functional use as a medium of exchange within the public sector. Exploring Crypto Payments Government Wide: Examples and Trends While California’s bill is a significant state-level initiative, the idea of crypto payments government wide isn’t entirely new globally or even within the U.S. Several municipalities and states have explored or implemented limited forms of crypto acceptance, often for specific purposes like tax payments. Examples and trends include: Ohio (paused): Briefly allowed businesses to pay taxes with Bitcoin via a third-party processor before suspending the program. Arizona & Colorado: Have explored or passed legislation related to state agencies accepting crypto, particularly for tax payments. Local Municipalities: Some cities have looked into accepting crypto for utility bills or local fees. International Examples: Countries like El Salvador have adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, while others are exploring central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) or allowing crypto payments for specific services. California’s approach, covering a broader range of state services and fees, could become a more comprehensive model for others to follow. It highlights a growing trend of governments adapting to the evolving digital economy and exploring how digital assets can fit into traditional financial operations. Actionable Insights for Residents and Businesses If you are a California resident or business owner, what should you take away from this development? Primarily, stay informed! The bill is still in progress, and the details of implementation will be crucial. If it passes, understanding the process for making California Bitcoin payments will be necessary. Key points to consider: Follow the bill’s progress through the State Senate. Understand which state services or fees will be eligible for crypto payments. Learn about the designated payment processor(s) the state partners with. Be aware of the terms, conditions, and potential fees associated with using crypto for state payments via the chosen processor. This is an opportunity to potentially use digital assets for everyday civic duties, but it’s essential to understand the mechanics once the system is live. Conclusion: A Step Towards Digital Integration The California State Assembly’s unanimous passage of the bill to allow state agencies to accept Bitcoin and other digital currencies marks a significant moment for cryptocurrency adoption in the United States. While it’s not yet law and faces further review in the Senate, it signals a strong legislative intent to embrace digital assets for public services. This move towards facilitating California Bitcoin payments , alongside broader government crypto adoption discussions, reflects a global trend of integrating digital finance into traditional systems. It presents opportunities for increased efficiency and accessibility, while also highlighting the need for careful implementation to address challenges like volatility and security. As the bill progresses, its potential impact on shaping the future of State accept crypto policies across the nation will be closely watched.

His remarks followed Elon Musk’s sharp criticism of the new One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). Keiser didn’t stop at calling out the U.S. financial system. He also repeated his long-standing prediction that Bitcoin will eventually soar to $2.2 million. According to him, the collapse of traditional finance is no longer a distant threat and Bitcoin is the only hedge. As debates over government spending and national debt intensify, both Keiser and Musk are capturing attention with their bold warnings about America’s financial future. What Is the OBBBA Bill, and Why Is Elon Musk Against It? The controversy began when Elon Musk, now playing an influential role in President Trump’s administration through the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.), took a public stand against the OBBBA bill. Introduced by Senate Republicans after Trump’s 2024 re-election, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act proposes $150 billion in new defense spending, while suggesting cuts in other areas. But critics warn it could drastically worsen the national deficit. Musk claims the bill would push the budget deficit to a “crushingly unsustainable” $2.5 trillion. He described the move as dangerous for taxpayers and damaging to the long-term health of the economy. His concerns have been echoed by others, including California Governor Gavin Newsom . It will massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit to $2.5 trillion (!!!) and burden America citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt https://t.co/dHCj3pprJO — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 3, 2025 Keiser: “You Can’t Taper a Ponzi Scheme” Keiser responded to Musk’s post with a blunt message: “You can’t taper a Ponzi scheme.” He believes the U.S. economy is trapped in a cycle of ever-increasing debt and that the system is heading for a major breakdown. This, he argues, is exactly why Bitcoin matters. He views it not just as an investment, but as a lifeboat from a sinking system. You can’t taper a Ponzi scheme. Bitcoin $2,200,000 in play. https://t.co/UGnsHgwTLI — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) June 3, 2025 Bitcoin to $2.2 Million? Keiser Still Thinks So Keiser has been predicting a massive Bitcoin surge since 2021. His target remains firm: $2.2 million. He believes Bitcoin, often referred to as digital gold, will thrive while fiat currencies and traditional assets decline. In his words , “Everything goes to zero against Bitcoin. Everything. And I mean everything… is relatively or absolutely a Ponzi scheme compared to Bitcoin.” For Keiser, Bitcoin isn’t just a better choice – it’s the only real choice. Is the U.S. Economy Reaching a Breaking Point? The OBBBA bill, backed by Senate Majority Leader John Thune and reportedly named by Donald Trump himself, has become a symbol of the larger battle over government spending and economic stability. With debt rising and confidence in centralized finance starting to erode, voices like Musk and Keiser are gaining traction.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/u-s-economy-is-a-ponzi-scheme-says-max-keiser-in-2-2m-bitcoin-prediction/,"BTC|DOGE|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION","News",cryptocompare

The ETH accumulation by whales and Vitalik Buterin has stirred optimism amongst the Ethereum community, who are now hunting for analyst views, and the price targets for the short and long term. ETH/BTC Chart Signals Bullish Breakout? Crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe , in a post, highlights that ETH has been slowly showing strength. The Ethereum/Bitcoin chart shared by him shows ETH breaking out from a falling wedge pattern, hinting at a bullish reversal. It is evident that after retesting, the breakout zone around 0.020, ETH surged and is now trading sideways above a key support area of 0.023, showcasing resilience. What is indicated as the “party start” zone is where the next major resistance lies at $0.02884. That being said, holding above the current green support zone is critical for a resumption of the trend. While volume shows growing interest during the breakout, the RSI is trending steadily, supporting bullish momentum. A clear breakout above 0.02884 could trigger a sharp uptrend. Contrarily, dropping below 0.023 may invalidate the bullish thesis.

2025-06-04T11:20:22,"Dogecoin cloud mining: start mining Dogecoin (DOGE) with zero equipment","In recent years, Dogecoin has become popular in the cryptocurrency circle with the attitude of ""starting as a joke and returning as a king"". From a tweet by Musk to the crazy fluctuations in the price of the currency, this currency that was originally created for fun has become a stepping stone for many people to achieve ""wealth freedom"". PaladinMining, the best Dogecoin and Bitcoin mining site in 2025, has launched a state-of-the-art AI cloud mining system that provides users with a seamless way to earn daily cryptocurrency profits without owning hardware or managing technical infrastructure. This article will explore how to use Dogecoin for cloud mining to get $5000 worth of cryptocurrency every day or even more. What is Dogecoin cloud mining? Dogecoin cloud mining is the process by which cloud mining service providers get new Dogecoin rewards by viewing transactions on the Dogecoin blockchain. This seems simple, but it is not easy to do! Cloud mining service providers process the same batch of transactions through multiple computers at the same time, but only one computer can get new coin rewards. The way to get new coins is when a node adds a new transaction block to an old block. This is done through complex mathematical equations. The node that solves the math problem first wins! It can then append the newly confirmed block of transactions to the rest of the blockchain. Most cryptocurrency mining works this way. However, Dogecoin mining differs from other currencies in some important ways. These aspects include: Algorithms: Each cryptocurrency has a set of rules for mining new coins. These rules are called mining algorithms or hashing algorithms. Block time: This is the average length of time it takes to check a new block of transactions and add it to the blockchain. Difficulty: This number represents how difficult it is to mine each new block of the currency. Mining difficulty can go up or down, depending on how many miners there are. The currency protocol also adjusts the difficulty to ensure that the block time remains constant. Reward: This is the amount of new currency awarded to the miner for each new block. How to do Dogecoin cloud mining Step 1: Choose PaladinMining cloud mining service provider. In rare cases, the platform has a team of professional analysts and IT teams who will analyze the hash rate generated by the miner's operation and replace the latest miner.

Are New Rules On The Way?","US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Paul Atkins made statements about Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies in his statement to the Senate Financial Services Appropriations Subcommittee. The SEC Chairman said the agency's cryptocurrency policy “will be done through notice and comment rulemaking, not enforcement.” At this point, the SEC Chairman said the agency would move away from shaping crypto rules through the courts and enforcement. Atkins said their main priority is to create clear crypto rules that protect investors and guard against scams. “Clear rules of the road are essential to protect investors from fraud, not least to help them spot scams that do not comply with the law. Policy making will be done through notification and comment, not through enforcement. For years, the SEC’s primary approach to crypto has been surprise lawsuits and tough action. This was especially true under former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. But those days are over.” Stating that the SEC will set “clear rules” for the issuance, storage and trading of cryptocurrencies, Atkins added that it will also prevent malicious individuals from violating the law. The SEC Chair also praised members Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda for launching the Crypto Task Force. The task force has so far held roundtables on key issues such as what counts as a security, how to regulate crypto trading and custody, and tokenization. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-04T11:15:38,"Kazakhstan's central bank rolls out crypto cards program in adoption push","The central bank of Kazakhstan has given the go-ahead for a project to issue crypto cards allowing users to spend digital coins where fiat is accepted. The pilot is part of a series of initiatives aimed at expanding cryptocurrency circulation in the country, including the issue of a stablecoin and the tokenization of assets. National Bank of Kazakhstan starts crypto cards project The monetary authority has announced the launch of a pilot that will provide citizens of the Central Asian Nation with the opportunity to spend their cryptocurrencies practically anywhere regular payment cards are accepted. The news came from a meeting in Almaty, Kazakhstan’s largest city, during which the central bank discussed upcoming projects to offer financial services based on digital assets with representatives of commercial banks, crypto exchanges and fintech companies. Participants reviewed the progress made in implementing President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev’s directive to develop the country’s digital asset industry. His order resulted from Astana’s decision to expand rather than restrict the circulation of cryptocurrencies. Discussions focused on the status of various projects to introduce financial services based on digital assets and to tokenize other assets. Officials also considered the integration of such assets into the traditional financial system and the development of relevant regulations. The crypto cards will be linked to wallets hosted by licensed providers of digital asset services like the cryptocurrency exchanges registered at the Astana International Financial Center (AIFC), the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) explained in a press release . Thus, users will be able to make non-cash payments at merchants accepting fiat, using the balances of their crypto wallets. The digital coins will be instantly converted to local currency, and settlements will be processed by crypto platforms and commercial banks working together. The NBK insisted: “This solution provides the ability to safely and conveniently integrate the circulation of digital assets into the existing payment infrastructure.” “The ‘crypto cards’ mechanism provides for the sale of the client’s digital assets on the AIFC crypto market at the time of the payment transaction,” the regulator elaborated, noting “in fact, the payment will be made using real money after the immediate sale of the crypto assets.” Kazakhstan plans to issue a stablecoin and tokenize assets The government of Kazakhstan has a number of other crypto and fintech projects in the pipeline this year. The NBK revealed these include the issue of a stablecoin secured by the national currency in both its original form and the digital tenge . Authorities in Astana also plan to tokenize financial assets, real estate and issue digital versions of regular securities. The central bank said it wants to set up systems facilitating the storage of collateral for digital financial assets and organize exchange and storage services for cryptocurrencies. Kazakhstan has been a major Bitcoin mining hotspot for years, but it has, until recently, maintained a quite conservative approach regarding its growing crypto sector. The crypto cards launch comes after taking other steps to relax the country’s crypto policy in the past months. The NBK highlighted: “Together with interested government agencies, the National Bank has drafted legislative amendments to ensure the expansion of the turnover of unsecured digital assets and the creation of a regulatory framework for digital financial (secured) assets.” In May, the monetary authority announced that crypto trading will be legalized outside the jurisdiction of the AIFC hub through a licensing regime for cryptocurrency exchanges . Also, last month, President Tokayev unveiled a plan to test crypto payments in a pilot zone called “CryptoCity.” In the past three years alone, Kazakhstan has received $35 million in taxes from the crypto mining industry. But according to its Deputy Minister of Digital Development Kanysh Tuleushin, the country can potentially collect 10 times more annually if it adopts favorable crypto rules.

2025-06-04T11:15:33,"Macro Strategist says Bitcoin is a ‘life raft’ as U.S. debt soars past 100% of GDP","Veteran macro strategist Raoul Pal has issued a stark warning about the future of fiat currencies, suggesting that the U.S. debt burden, aging demographics, and central bank interventions are setting the stage for long-term currency debasement and positioning Bitcoin ( BTC ) as the ultimate hedge. Pal, founder of Global Macro Investor and Real Vision, shared two key macroeconomic charts that he believes are being largely overlooked. “These charts are everything,” he stated , arguing that demographics, not fiscal policy, are the true driver of sovereign debt. The first chart compares the U.S. labor force participation rate with U.S. government debt as a percentage of GDP (inverted). Since 2002, participation has steadily declined while debt has surged, a trend that accelerated sharply after the 2008 financial crisis and again in 2020. U.S. labor force participation rate. Source: Global Macro Investor “Demographics is the KEY driver of debt,” Pal emphasized, noting that an aging workforce means fewer contributors to economic output and more reliance on government spending. U.S. government debt and net liquidity The second chart shows the tight correlation between U.S. government debt and net liquidity from the Federal Reserve. Fed net liquidity. Source: Global Macro Investor According to Pal, once debt surpasses 100% of GDP, organic economic growth is no longer sufficient to service interest payments. The gap is then covered by monetary printing “debasing the currency and lowering the denominator,” in his words. Against this backdrop, Bitcoin emerges as the primary asset capable of absorbing the impact. “Crypto (mainly Bitcoin) is the life raft as it not only offsets the annual 8% debasement but also gains value due to adoption effects,” Pal said. His conclusion is unambiguous: while traditional investors may focus on short-term policy moves or rate cycles, the bigger story lies in demographics and debt. “It’s all demographics. It always has been.” Featured image via Shutterstcok The post Macro Strategist says Bitcoin is a ‘life raft’ as U.S. debt soars past 100% of GDP appeared first on Finbold .",finbold,https://finbold.com/macro-strategist-says-bitcoin-is-a-life-raft-as-u-s-debt-soars-past-100-of-gdp/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|SPONSORED","Cryptocurrency news|Finance news|Bitcoin|BTC|cryptocurrency|finance|Raoul Pal",cryptocompare

Price prediction for 2025 suggests a potential high of $32. Long-term forecasts indicate LINK could reach $195 by 2030. Chainlink has emerged as a game-changing decentralized oracle network, enabling smart contracts to connect seamlessly with real-world data, APIs, and traditional financial systems. As the crypto market evolves, Chainlink’s role continues to expand—especially with its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) gaining traction. Its native token, LINK, not only powers the ecosystem but has also caught the attention of investors and analysts. With LINK price showing signs of a potential breakout and strong on-chain fundamentals backing its rise, the big question remains: Can LINK coin price hit $50 in 2025? Let’s dive into this detailed Chainlink price prediction 2025–2030 to find out. Table of Contents Overview LINK Price Prediction 2025 Chainlink Price Targets 2026 – 2030 LINK Crypto Price Forecast 2026 LINK Price Prediction 2027 Chainlink Price Analysis 2028 LINK Coin Price Prediction 2029 Chainlink Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis CoinPedia’s Chainlink Price Prediction FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency N/A Token LINK Price $ 14.22908467 1.04% Market Cap $ 9,349,931,113.5982 Trading Volume $ N/A Circulating Supply N/A All-time High $52.88 May 10, 2021 All-time Low $0.1263 Sep 23, 2017 LINK Price Prediction 2025 In 2025, Chainlink (LINK) began the year on a downward trajectory, but by April, momentum started to shift. Early in the month, LINK began recovering from a low of $10.067. By May, it had formed a bullish rounded bottom pattern, with a key neckline at $18. However, since mid-May, LINK has struggled to sustain its position near this neckline, pulling back toward the support level of the rounded bottom. A daily close above the $18 neckline could indicate a potential upward move, with LINK targeting a retest of the $24 resistance level in June—an area supported by a high-volume profile from earlier in the year. Should LINK break past the $24 mark, forecasts for late 2025 suggest the token could climb as high as $32. As June began, open interest (OI) surged, signaling increased trading activity and a rise in open contracts. The funding rate also improved, climbing from “-0.002%” to “+0.009%”, indicating growing bullish sentiment among traders. Moreover, the number of active addresses over the past 30 days has risen from May’s lows to 83.8K, suggesting renewed user engagement on the network. Chainlink’s social dominance has also seen a notable increase, with discussions around the token gaining momentum.

As of May 1, 2025, Ctrl Alt had tokenized over $295 million in assets, spanning real estate, private credit, funds, litigation finance and more. As per the press release, Ctrl Alt is the first VASP authorized to conduct issuer-related services. The approval means Ctrl Alt has consolidated its global footprint while operating within robust regulatory frameworks. The virtual asset issuer license allows Ctrl Alt to operate a full-stack, regulatory-compliant platform for the creation, management and distribution of tokenized real-world assets and ARVA (asset-referenced virtual assets) tokens. Ctrl Alt’s ARVA license is a new VARA Dubai category ARVA is a new legal category created for tokens backed by real-world value: real estate, commodities, and income streams developed by VARA Dubai. It involves a regulatory framework that brings investor protection, legal clarity, and operational structure to this space. Some of its key features include direct and fee-free redemption, real reserves held with licensed custodians, and legal segregation. Audits are mandatory, independent, and recurring. The word “stablecoin” is now protected, only usable by approved ARVAs with specific RWA backing. In short, ARVA tokens are defined under Dubai law as representing direct or indirect ownership of real-world assets, granting entitlement to receive or share income, and purporting to maintain a stable value by reference to real-world assets or income. ARVA tokens are backed or collateralized by such real-world assets or constitute a derivative, wrapped, duplicated, or fractionalized version of another ARVA. “We are proud to receive our VARA license and establish fully regulated operations in the UAE,” said Matt Ong, Founder and CEO at Ctrl Alt . “This achievement reflects our commitment to long-term regulatory alignment as we power the infrastructure for the next generation of financial products.” “Securing our VARA license marks a pivotal moment not just for Ctrl Alt, but for the broader digital asset ecosystem in the region,” said Robert Farquhar, Head of MENA at Ctrl Alt. “Dubai’s progressive regulatory environment provides a strong foundation for innovation in tokenization and we’re proud to contribute to that vision by delivering secure, compliant tokenization infrastructure for real-world asset issuance.” After the recent launch of Prypco Mint , the first licensed real estate tokenization platform, in partnership with Dubai Land Department, Dubai’s regulatory authority VARA , and powered by Ctrl Alt blockchain, the region’s first property token ownership certificate was issued and the first property was fully funded attracting more than 224 investors across 40 nationalities with an average investment amount of $2,700.

2025-06-04T11:00:32,"Bearish Predictions: Expert Suggests Bitcoin Could Fall Far Below $10,000","As the Bitcoin (BTC) price stabilizes 5% below its all-time high of $111,800, which was reached last week, predictions of further price declines have emerged. More surprisingly, one expert claims that all of BTC’s history is a “staged illusion,” which could cause it to dip toward the $10,000 mark for the first time in nearly five years. Expert Alleges Bitcoin’s Rise As ‘Largest Bubble In History’ Jacob King, the CEO of the news aggregator Whale Whire, took to social media to assert that Bitcoin’s trajectory is a carefully constructed illusion, designed to convey a sense of institutional commitment and government endorsement, thereby fostering the illusion of a thriving market driven by authentic demand. King’s bold claim characterized Bitcoin’s current state as the “largest bubble in human history,” poised to unfold as a monumental financial scandal. Of course, this is only King’s opinion based on his analysis. Related Reading: XRP Sell-Off Rumors Swirl After Expert Questions Ripple’s War Chest The narrative King presented delves into the web of interconnected entities that allegedly manipulate the cryptocurrency market. Drawing attention to the case of El Salvador’s purported Bitcoin investment, King highlighted discrepancies in the narrative, alleging that a significant portion of the country’s Bitcoin reserves had not been acquired through legitimate means but rather transferred from Bitfinex and Tether. This alleged manipulation, according to King, extends to the very core of the industry, with entities like Tether orchestrating alleged schemes to bolster liquidity and fabricate a façade of institutional backing. Alleged Bitcoin Market Manipulations The unraveling of these alleged machinations, as per King’s assertions, casts doubt on the authenticity of Bitcoin’s growth and the legitimacy of the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. King’s narrative underscores a network of “intertwined interests,” where figures like Michael Saylor, founder of the Bitcoin proxy firm Strategy (previously MicroStrategy), are depicted as integral players perpetuating a cycle of “leverage and speculation” rather than genuine investment in BTC. Furthermore, King’s reflections extend to the role of stablecoins like Tether’s USDT in propping up the Bitcoin market, creating a “fragile ecosystem” wherein the value of stablecoins could potentially surpass that of traditional fiat currencies. Related Reading: Stablecoins Ignite Record-Breaking May, Supply Jumps To $244B – Data The intricate interplay between Tether’s activities and Bitcoin’s stability, according to King, forms a precarious foundation susceptible to collapse in the face of regulatory scrutiny and diminishing institutional interest. All around, King issued a stark warning about a potential nosedive in Bitcoin’s value, suggesting that the cryptocurrency might plunge towards the $10,000 threshold for the first time in almost half a decade. Expressing skepticism regarding the sustainability of Bitcoin’s current price levels, King portrayed a market on the verge of a substantial correction. If this ominous forecast materializes, it would signify a profound shift in Bitcoin’s valuation, departing from the lofty peaks it has recently scaled. As of this writing, the market’s leading cryptocurrency trades at $105,788, recording a 3% retrace in the weekly time frame. Still, Bitcoin holds to gains of over 52% in the year-to-date period.

US President Donald Trump’s aggressive trade stance is rattling markets and clouding the economic outlook. However, Wall Street is scrambling to hedge against extreme shifts in Federal Reserve policy. Hedge funds globally clawed out strong returns in May as they capitalized on a softening dollar. This includes volatile cross-asset dislocations, which were triggered by April’s global trade shocks. However, while equities offered relief, commodities and fixed income proved risky. Meanwhile, bond markets went into selloff mode as concerns resurfaced over soaring debt in major economies like the US and Japan. Markets split over Fed rate moves As per reports, the swaps market still prices in two 25-basis-point cuts by year-end while options traders are bracing for everything from no cuts at all to a series of half-point slashes. This divergence reflects how Trump’s aggressive tariffs policies on steel and aluminum could disrupt jobs and stoke inflation. Even the banks are in a split. Goldman Sachs sees rate cuts delayed until 2026. On the other hand, Citi says rate cuts are coming this year and recommends hedging for downside risks. Source: CME Group Big bets are building in SOFR Options and Treasuries. The open interest in “no-cut” bets has climbed to 250,000 contracts, worth $25 million in premium. The ultra-dovish hedges are also back, and traders are buying into positions that target multiple half-point cuts before year-end. It is mostly in the SFRZ5 put tree and spreads around the 95.875 strike. The report mentioned that the SOFR options are buzzing at 95.625, and are the most crowded strike across June, September, and December tenors. This comes in when traders build layered bets on both upside protection and deeper cuts. Hedge funds score 3% gains A JPMorgan Treasury client survey showed that long positions rose to a two-week high, while short bets were trimmed. This suggested that a tilt toward duration amid growing macro risk. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) data shows that a huge positioning shakeup might be in place. It added that Hedge funds and asset managers dumped a massive 1.2 million 10-year note futures equivalents in the week to May 27. Asset managers slashed net long duration across the curve, dumping the equivalent of 718,000 10Y notes. Hedge funds unwound nearly half a million 10Y shorts. That’s cumulatively $22 million per basis point of long-end exposure gone. Another report mentioned that hedge funds globally clocked a solid 3% gain in May. It pushed year-to-date returns to 5%, per a JPMorgan prime brokerage note. Stock-picking funds returned 3%, while multi-strategy platforms notched 2.5%. The global digital assets market witnessed massive fluctuation throughout the past month, too. Bitcoin price surged by around 12% in the past 30 days, while it dropped by 3% over the last 7 days. BTC went on to hit its new all-time high (ATH) of above $111,900 on May 22. The biggest crypto is trading at an average price of $105,439 at press time. Ethereum, the biggest altcoin, surged by more than 44% in the past 30 days, outperforming Bitcoin. ETH is trading at $2,633 with a volume of $15.45 billion.

Some of the biggest whales on the network have bought over 30,000 #Bitcoin $BTC in the last 96 hours! pic.twitter.com/Z0Ujszhdnc — Ali (@ali_charts) June 3, 2025 According to his estimations, the collective bitcoin possessions of this group of investors are around 4.52 million BTC, representing almost 23% of the asset’s circulating supply. The latest buying spree comes in contrast to the price pullback of the leading digital asset, which has slipped by around 3% over the past week. Furthermore, BTC (currently worth approximately $105,800) is down 5.5% from its historical peak of nearly $112,000, registered on May 22 . Such accumulation from whales is typically interpreted as a bullish factor for the price. The effort leaves fewer assets available on the open market, which, combined with non-declining demand, could trigger a rally. Additionally, it could serve as an encouraging sign to smaller players who may also join the ecosystem with fresh capital. Less than a week ago, Martinez announced that investors holding between 100 BTC and 1,000 BTC (referred to as “sharks”) purchased 20,000 BTC in the span of just 48 hours. Back Into ‘Greed’ Territory While the whales’ activity suggests that the price may head north in the short term, other metrics indicate that the opposite scenario is also not out of the question. The popular Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index, which shows the current investor sentiment toward the cryptocurrency, is one example. On May 31, BTC’s price slipped below $104,000, which caused the ratio to retreat to 50, or the “Neutral” zone. However, the bulls recovered some of the losses in the following days, and the index re-entered “Greed” territory. BTC Fear and Greed, Source: alternative.me This suggests growing optimism and an increasing appetite for BTC, but investors should stay alert. After all, the cryptocurrency market often defies the crowd’s expectations, while some prominent individuals have previously recommended buying when fear dominates. On that note, we can cite Warren Buffett’s famous advice, who once said people should “ be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful.” The post 30,000 BTC Bought in 4 Days: New Bitcoin Bull Run Incoming? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",cryptopotato,https://cryptopotato.com/30000-btc-bought-in-4-days-new-bitcoin-bull-run-incoming/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Bitcoin Whales",cryptocompare
2025-06-04T10:53:06,"Bitcoin Sees Intense Surge in Realized Profits Following Ascent to $111K: Glassnode","Bitcoin investors have been aggressively taking profits since the cryptocurrency recorded a new all-time high (ATH) above $111,000. Although the asset has retracted over the past week and has been consolidating around $105,000, traders are still offloading their bags to realize gains. This is evident in Glassnode’s Entity-Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio, which shows that investors are seeing a high level of profitability recorded on less than 8% of trading days. Intense Surge in Realized Profits The market intelligence and research firm stated that Bitcoin investors are undergoing a significant shift towards profit-taking activity. Since BTC had its ATH breakout, the average coin has captured at least 16% profit during the sale, reflecting a notable uptick in profits locked in. On May 3, Glassnode also noted a significant spike in its Entity-Adjusted Realized Profit. The metric rallied above the $500 million/hour range three times within a 24-hour period, signaling intense profit-taking activity. Investors locking in gains coincided with bitcoin’s brief recovery to $106,780. The asset broke out of the $105,000 region yesterday; however, at the time of writing, it had fallen back, failing to hold above $105,500. Long-Term Holders Are Not Left Out Last week, Glassnode revealed that long-term BTC holders were not left out of the profit-taking spree. Investors holding BTC for one to five years took profits to the extent that their aggregate volume reached $4.02 billion, the highest since February. At the time, it was unclear whether the movement of coins from their wallets was part of a strategic reallocation or profit-taking. However, it is now clear that older Bitcoin investors have been taking profits, and this spending spike is being led by the cohort aged three to five years. While profit-taking is in full swing, on-chain data suggests that long-term investors, specifically those in the three- to five-year cohort, are becoming exhausted from selling. This group of BTC holders has locked in significant profits each time BTC rallied in March, October, November 2024, and February 2025. Currently, their supply share hovers around 12%, meaning they control a significant share of the wealth in the Bitcoin market. This also means that they are likely to sell and collect profits if BTC begins to surge again.

2025-06-04T10:45:00,"Trump-Backed Truth Social Files for Bitcoin ETF With SEC, What’s Next?","The U.S. President Donald Trump’s media empire has filed a Bitcoin ETF branded under his social media platform, Truth Social. The move, disclosed in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on June 3, could mark another bold step in Trump Media & Technology Group’s growing crypto ambitions. According to the SEC filing, NYSE Arca submitted the application on behalf of Yorkville America Digital — a crypto asset management firm that recently partnered with Trump Media. The proposed Bitcoin ETF aims to track the price of Bitcoin and list on the NYSE Arca exchange. While the filing left out key details such as a ticker symbol or management fees, it listed Foris DAX Trust Company — custodian of Crypto.com’s assets — as the custodian for the fund. Truth Social Bitcoin ETF in a Crowded Market? If approved, the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF would enter a competitive and saturated U.S. Bitcoin ETF market . Since the SEC gave its first approvals earlier this year, giants like BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) have dominated the space. IBIT alone manages close to $69 billion in assets. While Trump is the majority stakeholder in Trump Media, his shares have reportedly been moved to a trust managed by his son, Donald Trump Jr., distancing the former president from direct financial control as he campaigns for re-election. However, critics argue that Trump’s growing involvement in crypto — including NFTs, meme coins, and now ETFs — raises significant conflict of interest concerns . Truth Media Eyes Crypto Integration in Streaming Platform This isn’t Trump Media’s first step toward building a crypto footprint. In April, the firm signed a partnership with Yorkville and Crypto.com to explore a range of “Made in America” crypto ETFs. The newly filed “Truth Social Bitcoin ETF” now kickstarts the SEC’s 19b-4 review process, with a final decision due by January 29, 2026. Beyond ETFs, Trump Media is also pursuing deeper crypto integration across its platforms. CEO Devin Nunes recently told shareholders that the company is working on adding a utility token and digital wallet to its video streaming site, Truth+ . The token could initially be used to pay for subscription services and later be expanded for broader use across the Truth ecosystem.

2025-06-04T10:40:57,"Shocking Allegation: SEC Accused of Favoritism in US Crypto Regulation Analysis","BitcoinWorld Shocking Allegation: SEC Accused of Favoritism in US Crypto Regulation Analysis The world of US crypto regulation just got a bit more politically charged. A recent claim from Democratic staff in the U.S. House suggests potential bias in how crucial information about proposed cryptocurrency legislation is being shared. Specifically, they allege the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provided a technical analysis of the new crypto market structure bill, known as the CLARITY Act, to Republicans but not to Democrats. What’s the Fuss About SEC Crypto Analysis? When new legislation is introduced that could impact federal agencies, it’s standard practice for those agencies to provide a technical analysis to lawmakers. This helps Congress understand how the bill might affect the agency’s operations, resources, and regulatory authority. The SEC crypto division, like other parts of the commission, would typically offer such insights on bills concerning digital assets. The core of the current dispute, as reported by Decrypt, is the claim that this standard analysis for the CLARITY Act was shared exclusively with Republican staff. This has understandably caused frustration among Democrats, who feel they are being kept in the dark on important details regarding a bill that aims to reshape the regulatory landscape for the entire crypto industry. Understanding the CLARITY Act: A New Crypto Bill US Needs? The CLARITY Act is the latest legislative effort attempting to bring much-needed regulatory clarity to the U.S. digital asset market. It follows previous attempts, such as the FIT21 bill, aiming to create a comprehensive framework. Here are some key components of this proposed crypto bill US lawmakers are considering: Jurisdiction: It proposes giving the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) primary oversight over digital commodity spot markets. Registration Paths: It aims to establish clear registration processes for crypto platforms, requiring them to navigate rules set by both the SEC and the CFTC, depending on the nature of the assets and services they offer. Compliance: Mandates compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) for relevant entities, enhancing anti-money laundering efforts. Exemptions: Provides specific exemptions for certain decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and non-custodial wallet providers, acknowledging the unique nature of these technologies. Custody Rules: Introduces new requirements for approved digital asset custodians to ensure the safety and security of user funds. The bill seeks to end the long-standing regulatory uncertainty that has plagued the U.S. crypto market, providing a framework for innovation while protecting investors and ensuring market integrity. However, the alleged partisan handling of the SEC’s analysis adds a layer of political complexity to its passage. The Political Fallout: Democrats Respond to SEC Crypto Transparency Concerns The claim of the SEC sharing the CLARITY Act analysis solely with Republicans has sparked a strong reaction from Democratic leadership. Representative Maxine Waters, the Ranking Member of the powerful House Financial Services Committee, has publicly stated her intention to address this issue directly. She plans to formally request that SEC Chair Paul Atkins ensure the analysis is shared promptly and equally with staff from both parties. This incident highlights the challenges of achieving bipartisan consensus on US crypto regulation . Transparency and equal access to information are crucial for lawmakers to effectively evaluate complex legislation. If one party is perceived to have preferential access to agency analysis, it can erode trust and make collaboration more difficult. Why Does CFTC Crypto Oversight Matter? A significant aspect of the CLARITY Act, and many other proposed frameworks, is the delineation of authority between the SEC and the CFTC crypto markets. Currently, there’s a debate over whether certain digital assets are securities (under SEC jurisdiction) or commodities (under CFTC jurisdiction). This ambiguity creates regulatory uncertainty for businesses and investors. By assigning primary oversight of digital commodity spot markets to the CFTC, the CLARITY Act attempts to provide a clearer path forward for assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are often viewed as commodities. However, defining what constitutes a ‘digital commodity’ versus a ‘digital asset security’ remains a key challenge that any successful crypto bill US passes must address effectively. Looking Ahead: The Path for the CLARITY Act and US Crypto Regulation The alleged partisan sharing of the SEC’s analysis is a setback for the collaborative process needed to pass significant legislation like the CLARITY Act. For this crypto bill US is considering to move forward, it will require bipartisan support, especially in a divided Congress. The coming weeks will be crucial. Will the SEC address the Democrats’ concerns and ensure equal access to information? Can lawmakers from both parties find common ground on the best approach to US crypto regulation ? The outcome of this political skirmish over the SEC’s analysis could impact the bill’s trajectory and the broader effort to establish a clear regulatory framework for the U.S. crypto market. Summary: A Call for Transparency in Crypto Legislation The recent claim by U.S. House Democrats that the SEC shared its technical analysis of the CLARITY Act exclusively with Republicans underscores the political challenges facing US crypto regulation . While the CLARITY Act itself represents a significant attempt to create a clear framework involving both the SEC and CFTC crypto oversight, the alleged lack of transparency from the SEC threatens to derail bipartisan cooperation. As Representative Waters seeks equal access to the analysis, the focus remains on ensuring that all lawmakers have the necessary information to make informed decisions about this critical crypto bill US needs to consider carefully for the future of the digital asset industry.

2025-06-04T10:30:58,"Windsurf Faces Critical Claude AI Access Cutback: Impact on AI Coding","BitcoinWorld Windsurf Faces Critical Claude AI Access Cutback: Impact on AI Coding In the fast-evolving world of AI-assisted coding, often called vibe coding, access to cutting-edge AI models is paramount. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and developers keeping an eye on tech trends, a recent development involving Windsurf, the popular vibe coding startup reportedly being acquired by OpenAI, has raised concerns. Windsurf announced that Anthropic, a key provider of advanced AI models , has significantly curtailed its direct access to popular Claude AI models, specifically the Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Claude 3.5 Sonnet versions. What Happened with Anthropic and Windsurf? According to Windsurf CEO Varun Mohan, Anthropic provided minimal notice—less than five days—before drastically reducing Windsurf’s first-party capacity for these essential AI models . This abrupt change means Windsurf must now scramble to find alternative third-party compute providers to keep offering these models on its platform. Mohan expressed disappointment, stating that Windsurf had explicitly communicated its desire to pay Anthropic for full capacity. The sudden cutback impacts several key Claude 3.x models. Windsurf acknowledged in a blog post that while they have some existing capacity with third-party inference providers, it is currently insufficient to fully compensate for the lost direct access. This situation could lead to short-term availability issues for Windsurf users relying on these specific Claude AI models. Is This Related to Claude 4 Access? This decision by Anthropic follows closely on the heels of another perceived snub during the launch of Claude 4, Anthropic’s latest family of models known for their strong performance in software engineering tasks. At the Claude 4 launch, Windsurf reportedly did not receive direct access from Anthropic, unlike other prominent AI coding tools such as Anysphere’s Cursor, Cognition’s Devin, and Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot. This forced Windsurf to rely on workarounds for Claude 4 access, which are often more expensive and complicated for developers. What is Anthropic’s Side? An Anthropic spokesperson, Steve Mnich, provided some context to Bitcoin World, stating, “We’re prioritizing capacity for sustainable partnerships that allow us to effectively serve the broader developer community.” While direct first-party access was reduced, Mnich noted that users can still access Claude 4 on Windsurf by connecting their own Anthropic API key. He also pointed out that developers can access Claude through Anthropic’s direct API, partner ecosystem, and other development tools. However, the “bring your own key” solution is not ideal for many users. Developers have noted that this method is generally more expensive and complex than accessing models provided directly by the platform. Why Does Access to AI Models Matter for AI Coding Tools? The AI coding sector is highly competitive. Startups like Windsurf have seen rapid growth, with Windsurf reaching $100 million ARR in April. However, staying competitive requires offering developers access to the best available AI models . As companies like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic frequently release new models with improved capabilities, the ability to quickly integrate and offer these models is crucial for user satisfaction and platform growth. Optionality is a key demand for vibe coders. They want the flexibility to choose the best model for their specific task. Windsurf spokesperson Payal Patel confirmed this, stating the company has always believed in providing users with optionality. Anthropic’s decision makes maintaining this optionality more challenging for Windsurf, potentially stunting its growth compared to competitors who seem to have better access to cutting-edge Claude AI models. User feedback highlights this issue. Ronald Mannak, a startup founder specializing in Swift programming, switched from Windsurf to Cursor recently specifically to gain easier access to Claude 4, which he found offered a significant jump in capabilities for his work. This demonstrates the direct impact limited model access can have on user retention and platform adoption. Summary Windsurf is facing a significant challenge due to Anthropic ‘s decision to limit its direct access to key Claude AI models with little notice. This follows a pattern of limited access to newer models like Claude 4 compared to competitors in the AI coding space. While Anthropic cites prioritizing sustainable partnerships and points to API key access as an alternative, this workaround is less convenient and potentially more costly for users. The situation underscores the intense competition in the vibe coding market and the critical importance for platforms like Windsurf to secure reliable access to the leading AI models to retain users and fuel growth.

2025-06-04T10:27:27,"Bitcoin Pushes Back Toward $106K Amid Liquidity Tug-of-War","Bitcoin rebounded toward $106,000 on June 3 following a turbulent start to the trading day. After briefly slipping below its previous all-time highs from late 2024, the cryptocurrency managed to steady itself, resisting a feared test of the $100,000 support level. Market watchers noted an emerging bullish sentiment, fueled by renewed interest in key liquidity zones. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView highlighted the recovery of BTC/USD, showing the pair reversing its earlier drop after the Wall Street open. Traders Eye High-Stakes Liquidity Zones Popular trader Daan Crypto Trades suggested that both bulls and bears had positions clustered around the current price range, hinting at the potential for volatile moves. “There are still a lot of positions built up on both sides,” he stated on X. “Major liquidity zones above $110K and below $103K.” This tension between upward and downward liquidity could trigger sudden price swings, with analysts watching closely for a breakout. CoinGlass data showed that upside liquidity was already within range, raising the possibility of a short-term rally designed to flush out positions. Support Builds, but Momentum Still Lacking Material Indicators, a trading analytics platform, pointed out key areas of support that could come into play if prices dip again. “FireCharts shows ~$263M in BTC bid liquidity laddered down to $97,750, and an additional block of plunge protection just above the Yearly Open,” the firm stated. This strong bid interest may serve to buffer Bitcoin against further declines and keep the broader uptrend intact. Still, Material Indicators remained cautious about expectations for new all-time highs in the near term. “The trend undoubtedly is still up, but there has been no strong continuation above $100K+ this year just yet,” Daan Crypto Trades remarked the day before. Profit-Taking Begins but Euphoria Still Absent According to on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, Bitcoin holders have started realizing profits, though not at the scale seen during past bull market peaks. “The recent Bitcoin ATH breakout has led to a notable uptick in profits locked in, with the average coin capturing a +16% profit,” the firm said in its latest edition of “The Week Onchain.” Only 8% of all trading days have yielded higher profits for investors, signaling that a wave of profit-taking may be underway. Glassnode also emphasized that the market hasn’t yet entered a “euphoric” phase typically associated with cycle tops. Instead, traders appear cautiously optimistic, with many still waiting for a strong catalyst to push Bitcoin decisively past the $110,000 mark.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/bitcoin-pushes-back-toward-106k-amid-liquidity-tug-of-war/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare

Pepe Unchained is the latest viral hit, lighting up the charts with aggressive marketing, humorous branding, and a wave of community-driven momentum. And while short-term gains are always a tempting lure, seasoned investors know that true wealth isn’t built on hype. It’s built on scalable tech, long-term utility, and inclusive access. That’s where Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) changes the game completely. Meme Energy vs. Measurable Gains Let’s be fair—Pepe Unchained isn’t just a joke coin. It has managed to attract attention with some clever tokenomics and a strong community. But that doesn’t make it a sustainable or serious wealth builder. It lacks advanced infrastructure, doesn’t offer mobile-first mining, and can’t support real-world utility beyond speculation. In short, it’s fun, but it’s not functional for serious investors. Bitcoin Solaris, on the other hand, is a wealth-building ecosystem built with intent and precision. From its dual-consensus blockchain to its upcoming mobile mining app, BTC-S delivers real tools for long-term value. The Future of Mining in Your Pocket Bitcoin Solaris is pioneering what it calls “Universal Mining”—making mining possible from virtually any device, anywhere in the world. At the center of this revolution is the upcoming Solaris Nova App, which transforms mining into a one-click , fully automated experience: Works on phones, laptops, desktops, and even browsers One-tap mining with adaptive algorithms Energy-efficient settings that preserve battery and performance Integrated wallet and staking options No technical experience required Mining is no longer a game for the elite. With BTC-S, even someone with a mid-range Android can start earning and participating in blockchain security. This inclusiveness is what real decentralization looks like. The Blockchain Revolution Just Went Mobile—Explore BTC-S Now High-Speed, Low-Energy Blockchain Infrastructure What truly sets Bitcoin Solaris apart isn’t just ease of access—it’s the foundation beneath it. BTC-S runs on a hybrid Proof-of-Work and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (PoW + DPoS) consensus system. This setup enables blazing speeds of up to 100,000 TPS on the Solaris Layer while keeping energy consumption up to 99.95% lower than traditional Bitcoin mining. It also uses: A validator rotation system to avoid centralization A 5-minute block time on its PoW base layer for robust security Advanced slashing and zero-knowledge proof options to mitigate attacks This isn’t hype. This is advanced cryptographic design paired with real-world scalability. BTC-S vs. Pepe Unchained: What Really Matters Feature Pepe Unchained Bitcoin Solaris Purpose Meme and speculation Scalable wealth-building platform Mining Support None Universal mobile + hardware mining Transaction Speed Basic Up to 100,000 TPS Energy Efficiency Unverified 99.95% less than Bitcoin Long-Term Ecosystem Limited DeFi, Gaming, IoT, Enterprise ready User Accessibility Traders only Everyday users, anywhere The numbers speak for themselves. While Pepe Unchained may dominate Twitter for a few weeks, Bitcoin Solaris is designed to dominate the market for years. The Presale That’s Turning Heads Right now, over 11,000 users have already joined the BTC-S presale, which is gaining traction as one of the shortest and most explosive launches in recent memory. With just a few weeks left, investors are racing to grab tokens at the current price of $6—well ahead of the $20 launch target. Crypto enthusiasts and reviewers like Token Galaxy are diving deep into why BTC-S is attracting this much attention, highlighting its mobile mining capability, scalable infrastructure, and unmatched energy efficiency. Presale Highlights: Current Price: $6 Next Phase: $7 Launch Price: $20 10% Bonus for early buyers Launch Date: July 31, 2025 Over $1.8M raised With only around 8 weeks left, this could very well be the most affordable presale before BTC-S becomes mainstream. Beyond Hype: A Real Investment Path Bitcoin Solaris isn’t trying to go viral. It’s building the infrastructure to reshape crypto mining, scalability, and accessibility for the next decade. Whether it’s through the upcoming Solaris Nova App, real smart contract support, or its hybrid consensus—BTC-S is offering a serious wealth-building path for those tired of chasing memes.

2025-06-04T10:25:23,"Bitcoin Moonshot? Trader Bets on 28% Surge in BlackRock's Spot BTC ETF by Month-End","A bold bet on BlackRock's spot bitcoin BTC ETF (IBIT) crossed the tape Tuesday, suggesting expectations for a ""moonshot"" or rapid price surge in the world's largest publicly listed fund by month-end. On Tuesday, a trader picked up 3,000 contracts of the IBIT $77 strike call option expiring on June 27, according to data source Barchart.com . The trader paid a total premium of $39,000 for the bullish exposure. A call option gives the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a later date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market. The $77 strike call represents a bet that prices will cross that level before the expiry. In other words, the bitcoin-tracking ETF, which closed Tuesday at $60.40, is expected to rally by over 28% by June 27. Pseudonymous observer EndGame Macro called it a high-conviction bet on a bullish breakout. ""With IBIT trading around $60.40 and the $77 strike sitting roughly 28% out of the money [above the spot price], this trader is either anticipating a major catalyst like a surge in ETF inflows, a macro pivot, or a regulatory greenlight or they’re hedging a much larger directional exposure,"" EndGame Macro said. ""Whether it’s a calculated moonshot or part of a broader positioning strategy, one thing’s clear: they’re expecting serious volatility before June 27,"" EndGame Macro added. Bull mood returns Overall, the mood in the IBIT options market shifted bullish on Tuesday, with the one-year put-call skew turning negative, according to data source Market Chameleon . The negative shift indicates calls, offering asymmetric upside exposure, are again trading relatively costlier than puts, The renewed bullish shift follows a brief period from last week when puts traded at a premium to calls, reflecting downside fears.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/04/bitcoin-moonshot-trader-bets-on-28-surge-in-blackrock-s-spot-btc-etf-by-month-end,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|BlackRock|Markets|Bitcoin|Options|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-04T10:20:40,"Altcoin Season Index Plummets to 25: Is it Bitcoin Season Again for the Crypto Market?","BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Index Plummets to 25: Is it Bitcoin Season Again for the Crypto Market? Are you watching the Altcoin Season Index? This widely-followed metric recently dropped to 25, a figure that carries significant weight in the world of crypto investing. A score of 25 signals that the market is firmly entrenched in what’s known as Bitcoin Season , a period where the king of crypto typically outperforms most other digital assets. If you’re invested in altcoins or planning your next moves in the crypto market, understanding what this index means is crucial. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index The Altcoin Season Index , tracked by platforms like CoinMarketCap, is a simple yet powerful tool designed to give investors a snapshot of market sentiment and performance trends. It specifically looks at the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens which don’t typically behave like speculative assets. The index then compares the performance of these 100 altcoins against Bitcoin over the preceding 90 days. How it Works: For each of the top 100 altcoins, the index checks if it has outperformed Bitcoin in terms of price growth over the last 90 days. The Thresholds: Altcoin Season: Occurs when 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The index score is typically high, approaching 100. Bitcoin Season: Occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The index score is low, typically below 25. Neither Season: When the performance is somewhere in between (25% to 75% of altcoins outperforming BTC), the market is considered to be in a neutral phase, or perhaps a ‘chop’ zone. The Score: The index ranges from 1 to 100, providing a visual representation of where the market stands. A score closer to 1 indicates strong Bitcoin dominance, while a score closer to 100 indicates strong altcoin performance relative to Bitcoin. As reported, the index registered 25 on June 4th, a slight dip from the previous day. This number is right on the threshold of the Bitcoin Season definition, clearly indicating that for the majority of the top altcoins, the last three months have been a period of underperformance compared to Bitcoin. What Does Bitcoin Season Mean for the Crypto Market? When the Altcoin Season Index points to Bitcoin Season , it signifies a period where capital tends to consolidate around Bitcoin. This often happens after significant market moves, during times of uncertainty, or when Bitcoin specific narratives (like institutional adoption or halving events) are strong. During Bitcoin Season , investors might see Bitcoin’s price rising steadily, or holding its value relatively well, while many altcoins either stagnate, trade sideways, or even decline against their BTC pairs. This doesn’t mean altcoins aren’t moving in USD terms, but their performance is typically lagging significantly behind Bitcoin. For participants in the crypto market , this shift in dynamics is important. It suggests that the broader risk appetite might be lower, with investors preferring the relative safety and established narrative of Bitcoin over the higher volatility and potentially higher reward (but also higher risk) of altcoins. Why is the Altcoin Season Index at 25 Right Now? The current position of the Altcoin Season Index at 25 isn’t a random event. Several factors likely contribute to this state of Bitcoin Season : Post-Halving Dynamics: Following Bitcoin’s halving event in April 2024, historical patterns suggest a period of consolidation or slower growth for Bitcoin, but this doesn’t automatically trigger an immediate altcoin surge. Sometimes, the market takes time to digest the halving’s impact, and capital might remain concentrated in BTC as investors await clearer trends. Institutional Focus: The approval and success of Bitcoin ETFs in the US have brought significant institutional capital into Bitcoin. This continuous inflow provides strong buying pressure for BTC, potentially outperforming the demand for many altcoins which lack similar direct institutional investment vehicles. Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Global economic conditions, interest rate outlooks, and geopolitical events can influence investor sentiment. During times of uncertainty, riskier assets like altcoins tend to suffer more than established assets like Bitcoin. Profit-Taking and Rotation: Some investors who saw gains in altcoins during earlier rallies might rotate profits back into Bitcoin or stablecoins, contributing to altcoin underperformance relative to BTC. These factors combine to create an environment where only a small percentage of the top altcoins have managed to outshine Bitcoin over the recent 90-day period, pushing the Altcoin Season Index down to its current level. Implications for Altcoin Season and Crypto Investing So, what does a reading of 25 on the Altcoin Season Index mean for your crypto investing strategy? Challenges: Altcoin Underperformance: Expect many altcoins to continue lagging behind Bitcoin. Simply holding a diversified altcoin portfolio might see your overall portfolio value grow slower than if you were heavily weighted in BTC, or potentially even decline relative to BTC. Increased Volatility for Altcoins: During Bitcoin Season , individual altcoin prices can be more susceptible to sharp drops, especially if Bitcoin experiences a significant correction. Opportunities and Actionable Insights for Crypto Investing: Focus on Quality: This period can highlight the stronger altcoin projects with solid fundamentals, active development, and real-world use cases. These might be the ones among the 25% (or less) that manage to perform relatively well. Strategic Accumulation: If you believe in the long-term potential of specific altcoins, Bitcoin Season can present opportunities to accumulate positions at potentially lower prices relative to Bitcoin. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) into promising altcoins during this phase can be a prudent strategy. Risk Management: Re-evaluate your portfolio allocation. Consider if your altcoin exposure aligns with your risk tolerance, knowing that the current market dynamic favors Bitcoin. Research is Key: Dive deep into the projects you hold or are considering. Understand their technology, team, tokenomics, and competitive landscape. Don’t rely solely on hype. Diversification: While it’s Bitcoin Season , don’t forget about Bitcoin itself! A balanced approach to crypto investing often involves exposure to both BTC and carefully selected altcoins. When Might Altcoin Season Return? Market cycles are a fundamental part of the crypto market . Just as Bitcoin Season follows periods of altcoin strength, Altcoin Season will eventually return. Predicting the exact timing is impossible, but here are some potential catalysts to watch for: Bitcoin Consolidation: Often, Altcoin Season kicks off after Bitcoin has had a significant rally and enters a period of consolidation or sideways trading. This allows capital that flowed into BTC to potentially rotate into altcoins seeking higher percentage gains. Major Altcoin Narratives: The emergence of strong narratives around specific sectors (like DeFi, NFTs, AI tokens, GameFi) or major protocol upgrades can drive significant interest and investment into altcoins. Increased Risk Appetite: A shift in global macroeconomic conditions or a sustained period of stability in the crypto market could increase investor confidence and willingness to take on the higher risk associated with altcoins. Monitoring the Altcoin Season Index itself is, of course, the most direct way to track this potential shift. A sustained move upwards, particularly crossing the 75 threshold, would signal the return of Altcoin Season . Navigating the Crypto Market During Bitcoin Season Operating in the crypto market during Bitcoin Season requires patience and a clear strategy. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term altcoin price action. Instead, focus on long-term potential, project fundamentals, and managing your risk effectively. Use this time to deepen your understanding of the projects you’re invested in and look for strategic entry points if you believe in their future. Conclusion: The Altcoin Season Index Tells a Clear Story The Altcoin Season Index at 25 sends a clear message: we are currently in Bitcoin Season . This means that, statistically, most altcoins are underperforming Bitcoin. While this presents challenges for those heavily invested in altcoins, it’s a normal part of the crypto market cycle. For informed crypto investing, understanding these phases is key. Use this period to refine your strategy, focus on quality projects, manage risk, and prepare for when the winds eventually shift back towards Altcoin Season .

Analyst Answered!","While the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) is running from record to record in 2025, altcoins, especially Ethereum (ETH), are far from their previous ATHs. While expectations for a continued bull rally continue in the market, some analysts argue that the bull market may be over and altcoins will not experience the expected explosive rally. Speaking to Coindesk, Matteo Greco, an analyst at digital asset management company Fineqia, said that the cryptocurrency market is in the late cycle phase and the peak has not yet been reached. Stating that Bitcoin reserves on exchanges continue to decrease, Greco said that altcoin reserves such as Ethereum and XRP have stabilized. Analyzing stablecoin reserves as well as Bitcoin and altcoin reserves, the analyst stated that stablecoin reserves are at their highest levels in many years. At this point, the analyst noted that the reserve situation may be that investors are preparing to invest new capital and rise rather than exit the market. Greco also revealed that BTC’s market cap-to-realized value (MVRV) ratio is around 2.2, which is well below the historical peak of 3.7. According to the analyst, this MVRV level indicates that the market is in the late cycle phase and has not yet reached its peak. Crypto exchange Bitunix analysts also evaluated Bitcoin. At this point, exchange analysts said that BTC's short-term support level is $ 105,000. If BTC holds above this level, the price may continue to rise. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-04T10:00:43,"Critical: US Military Leaders Support Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Amid Rising Tensions","BitcoinWorld Critical: US Military Leaders Support Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Amid Rising Tensions Imagine the U.S. military, traditionally focused on tanks, jets, and ships, now considering digital assets like Bitcoin as a strategic tool. This intriguing possibility is gaining traction, thanks to comments from crypto-friendly U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis. She recently revealed that some branches of the US military Bitcoin the idea of establishing a national Bitcoin reserve, highlighting a fascinating intersection of cryptocurrency and national security. Why is the US Military Considering a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve? According to a Bloomberg interview cited by Cointelegraph, Senator Lummis stated that certain military leaders view Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a critical strategic resource. This perspective is particularly prevalent among those stationed in Southeast Asia, a region increasingly marked by geopolitical and economic tensions, especially with China. These military figures reportedly see a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve as essential preparedness. The rationale behind this thinking is multifaceted. In an era where traditional financial systems can be vulnerable to state-sponsored attacks, sanctions, or disruptions, an asset like Bitcoin offers unique properties. Its decentralized nature means it operates outside the control of any single government or central bank, making it potentially resilient in scenarios where conventional payment or reserve systems might fail or be compromised. What Does a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Entail? While the exact details of what a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve would look like are still theoretical, the concept involves a nation holding a significant amount of Bitcoin as part of its strategic assets. Historically, nations have held reserves of gold, foreign currencies, and commodities like oil to ensure economic stability and preparedness. A Bitcoin reserve would function similarly, but for the digital age. Why now? The current global landscape is characterized by: Rising Geopolitical Tensions: Competition between major powers is increasing, leading to concerns about economic warfare and financial system vulnerabilities. Economic Uncertainty: Inflationary pressures and global economic instability make alternative reserve assets more attractive. Digital Transformation: The increasing digitalization of finance and the rise of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are changing the nature of global economic power. Military leaders, especially those anticipating potential conflict scenarios, understand that future conflicts might not just be fought on land, sea, or air, but also in the financial realm. Having access to a censorship-resistant, globally transferable asset like Bitcoin could provide a crucial advantage or lifeline. Senator Cynthia Lummis: A Strong Voice for Bitcoin Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming has long been one of the most vocal proponents of Bitcoin and blockchain technology within the U.S. government. Her stance is rooted in a belief in sound money principles and the potential for Bitcoin to serve as a hedge against inflation and government overspending. Her comments about military interest add a significant new dimension to the conversation around Bitcoin adoption. She has consistently advocated for clearer regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies and has highlighted Bitcoin’s potential benefits for individual investors and the national economy. Her revelation about military leaders supporting a reserve underscores that the conversation about Bitcoin’s role is moving beyond just finance and into the realm of national security and strategic planning. The Geopolitical Angle: Bitcoin and US-China Tensions The specific mention of military leaders focused on Southeast Asia and preparing for tensions with China is particularly telling. China has been actively developing its own digital currency, the digital yuan, which could potentially be used to circumvent the U.S.-dominated global financial system. In this context, a Geopolitical Bitcoin strategy for the U.S. could serve several purposes: Financial Resilience: Provide a means to conduct transactions or access funds if traditional channels are blocked or disrupted. Alternative Power Projection: Offer allies or partners a neutral, decentralized alternative to potentially state-controlled digital currencies. Economic Warfare Countermeasure: Develop capabilities to use or counter digital assets in economic conflicts. Preparing for potential military conflict in the modern age involves considering all facets of national power, including financial and technological strength. Bitcoin, with its unique properties, is seemingly being evaluated as a tool within this broader strategic framework. Potential Benefits of a US National Bitcoin Reserve Establishing a US National Bitcoin Reserve could offer several potential advantages, according to proponents of the idea: Economic Insurance: Act as a hedge against potential devaluation of the U.S. dollar or instability in global reserve currencies. Financial Sovereignty: Provide a means for the government to operate financially in scenarios where traditional systems are compromised. Geopolitical Tool: Potentially be used in diplomatic or strategic contexts, though how this would work is complex and debated. Attracting Talent and Innovation: Signal U.S. commitment to digital assets, potentially fostering domestic innovation in the blockchain space. Challenges and Considerations While the concept is compelling, building and managing a strategic Bitcoin reserve presents significant challenges: Security: Safely storing a large amount of Bitcoin (cold storage, multi-signature wallets, physical security) is paramount and complex. Volatility: Bitcoin’s price volatility poses risks to the reserve’s value, although proponents might argue its long-term trend and role as a hedge mitigate this. Political Will: Gaining broad political consensus for such a move would be difficult, given varying views on Bitcoin in Washington. Implementation: Deciding how to acquire, manage, and potentially use the reserve requires establishing entirely new protocols and infrastructure. Public Perception: Explaining the need for and purpose of a Bitcoin reserve to the public could be challenging. Looking Ahead: What Does This Mean for Bitcoin’s Future? The fact that U.S. military leaders are even discussing the strategic importance of Bitcoin is a significant development. It suggests that Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed not just as a retail investment or a tech curiosity, but as a potential asset class with implications for national security and global power dynamics. This kind of institutional interest, particularly from a sector as conservative as the military, could further legitimize Bitcoin in the eyes of other government bodies and traditional financial institutions. While a US National Bitcoin Reserve is likely still a long way off, Senator Lummis’s comments open the door for more serious discussion and analysis within policy circles. It highlights the growing recognition that in the 21st century, economic and financial tools, including digital assets, are integral components of national defense and strategic competition. This evolving perspective could influence future regulatory approaches, government research into digital assets, and potentially even lead to pilot programs exploring the practicalities of using Bitcoin for strategic purposes. It’s a powerful indicator of how far Bitcoin has come from its origins and its potential future role on the world stage.

2025-06-04T10:00:34,"Brian Armstrong Says Bitcoin May Become Global Reserve If U.S. Fails to Act","The post Brian Armstrong Says Bitcoin May Become Global Reserve If U.S. Fails to Act appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A U.S. debt default could trigger major economic fallout, higher interest rates, job losses, and a weaker dollar. With debt at $36 trillion and a 122% debt-to-GDP ratio, rising costs and political gridlock ahead of the August 2025 ceiling deadline add pressure. Still, the U.S. has never defaulted, and Treasury officials believe it can be avoided with timely action. Looking at the current scenario, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong is warning that Bitcoin could replace the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency if America fails to control its spending. However, so far, Bitcoin has failed to capitalize on the U.S. Debt Spiral . Currently trading around $104,500, BTC is at a critical level rather than surging, even as the U.S. dollar weakens and economic uncertainty grows. Bitcoin’s Appeal Grows Amid Soaring U.S. Debt If the electorate doesn't hold congress accountable to reducing the deficit, and start paying down the debt, Bitcoin is going to take over as reserve currency. I love Bitcoin, but a strong America is also super important for the world. We need to get our finances under control. https://t.co/aeBE7pUuHo — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) June 4, 2025 Armstrong took to X this week, voicing support for Bitcoin but expressing concern about America’s financial trajectory. “I love Bitcoin, but a strong America is also super important for the world,” he wrote. “We need to get our finances under control.” The comments come as the U.S. debt hits a historic high, with fiscal responsibility at the center of political debate. Armstrong warned that if voters don’t pressure Congress to reduce the deficit, Bitcoin could naturally evolve into the dominant global currency. His warning gains traction as institutional demand for Bitcoin soars , bolstered by its fixed supply and rising reputation as a hedge against inflation. But Crypto analyst Wendy O believes Bitcoin won’t become a reserve currency due to its high volatility. However, she says it will still be in demand. In her view, a stablecoin is more likely to fill the role of a global reserve currency. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Consensys CEO Lubin Reveals What Triggered Ethereum’s Comeback , Trump-Backed Bill Faces Backlash Moreover, the timing couldn’t be more heated. House Republicans are pushing a Trump-endorsed spending bill that extends tax breaks, increases military spending, and cuts social programs. Critics, including six Nobel Prize-winning economists, say it could add another $3 trillion to the national debt if made permanent. Tesla CEO Elon Musk slammed the bill as a “pork-filled, disgusting abomination,” warning that it could drive the deficit to $2.5 trillion annually. Bitcoin Reserve Gaining Momentum? In parallel news, U.S. lawmakers are exploring Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset . A bill introduced by Senator Cynthia Lummis proposes that the Treasury accumulate 1 million BTC, which is around 5% of the total supply, to hedge against long-term fiscal instability. Under the proposal, BTC would be stored in decentralized vaults, funded through existing Treasury assets. Lummis framed it as a modern version of the gold reserve, arguing it could protect the dollar’s value and strengthen national security. With Trump pushing to make the U.S. a global crypto hub and rising distrust in traditional monetary policy, Bitcoin is inching closer to the heart of America’s financial strategy. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-04T08:59:04,"ETH Price Prediction","<p>ETH Price Prediction Using This Guide: What is ""Average Buy Profit,"" and How Can Ethereum Traders Use it Effectively?</p><p>If you're new to crypto investing or trading, you'll encounter many unfamiliar terms and metrics. One particularly useful metric is the Average Buy Profit (ABP), offered by blockchain analytics platforms like Whale Alert. Let’s break down ABP step-by-step and see how Ethereum (ETH) traders can use it effectively.</p><p>(Note: ForexLive.com will soon evolve into InvestingLive.com this summer, expanding our insights across multiple asset classes—stay tuned!)</p><p>Step 1: What Exactly is Average Buy Profit (ABP)?</p><p>Imagine this straightforward scenario:</p><p>You decide to buy Ethereum (ETH) and purchase your first ETH at $2,000. Later, ETH is rising, and you buy another ETH at $3,000. Now you hold two ETH tokens, and you've spent a total of $5,000. Your average buy price per ETH, therefore, is $2,500.</p><p>Now, let's say Ethereum’s price later rises to $3,500. At this price, your Average Buy Profit per ETH token is $1,000. This is because your average buy price was $2,500, and the current market price is now $3,500.</p><p>In simple terms, ABP measures how profitable (or unprofitable) your investment is per token, based on your average purchasing price.</p><p>Step 2: Why is ABP Important for Traders?</p><p>ABP provides a clear snapshot of market sentiment—whether investors are currently profitable (bullish) or at a loss (bearish):</p><ul><li><p>Positive ABP (profit) indicates that many investors bought their crypto at lower prices and are currently profitable. This usually means the market sentiment is positive or bullish.</p></li><li><p>Negative ABP (loss) suggests investors bought at higher prices, and if they sell now, they’d lose money. This usually implies caution or a bearish sentiment.</p></li></ul><p>Understanding ABP helps traders anticipate shifts in market sentiment and potential price movements.</p><p>Step 3: Understanding the ABP Chart (Green Bars vs. Red Bars)</p><p>ABP is usually visualized through easy-to-read charts:</p><ul><li><p>Green bars: Show investors selling at a profit, typically indicating strong market sentiment.</p></li><li><p>Red bars: Show investors selling at a loss, signaling short-term market uncertainty or possible bearishness.</p></li></ul><p>Ethereum (ETH) ABP in the Last 7 Days</p><p>Looking at Ethereum’s recent ABP data from whale-alert.io, here's what we observed:</p><ul><li><p>Early in the week (Days 1-2):
Many green bars appeared, suggesting frequent profit-taking. Investors who bought ETH earlier at lower prices were selling to secure their gains. This is typically a sign of positive market sentiment and healthy upward price momentum.</p></li><li><p>Midweek (Days 3-5):
Some noticeable red bars appeared, meaning investors were selling ETH at a loss. This likely indicated temporary price dips or moments of market uncertainty. Such periods may provide attractive buying opportunities for traders who remain bullish on Ethereum’s longer-term prospects.</p></li><li><p>Most recent (Days 6-7):
We see a return of frequent and substantial green bars, indicating renewed strength and optimism. Investors once again started taking profits, suggesting that the Ethereum price has stabilized or resumed rising.</p></li></ul><p>ETH Proice Prediction: Additional Note for Sharp-eyed Traders</p><p>If you've carefully studied the ABP chart image included in this article, you may have noticed the beginning of a relatively significant red bar at the most recent timeframe. This suggests some investors are now beginning to sell Ethereum at a loss, which could indicate the start of some short-term profit-taking or a temporary pullback.</p><p>To cross-check this, we analyzed Ethereum through volume profile analysis using Bitcoin Futures as a correlated indicator. Currently, Bitcoin Futures trade at around $2,657, with notable resistance zones appearing slightly higher, specifically between $2,665 to $2,675. This zone includes key technical resistance points such as yesterday’s Point of Control (POC), yesterday’s Value Area High (VAH), and other important price levels.</p><p>This means Ethereum, correlated with Bitcoin’s movement, might encounter temporary selling pressure or profit-taking at apx $2675. Although Ethereum's longer-term trend remains bullish, short-term traders and investors might expect a temporary price dip or profit-taking in this area. It's wise to stay alert and carefully manage your positions accordingly.</p><p>Frequently Asked Question (FAQ)</p><p>Q: ""If investors are selling Ethereum to take profits, isn't that actually bearish? Why wouldn’t they just 'HODL'?""</p><p>A:
This is a common and important question, especially for beginners. Let's clarify:</p><ul><li><p>Normal Market Behavior: Profit-taking is very common and healthy. Investors routinely lock in gains to manage risk, rebalance their portfolios, or simply secure their profits.</p></li><li><p>Profit-taking vs. Panic-selling: There’s a big difference between careful, strategic profit-taking (typically positive or neutral) and rapid panic-selling (usually negative). Profit-taking tends to be measured and gradual after prices have risen significantly, whereas panic-selling is sudden and driven by fear.</p></li><li><p>Partial Selling and Long-term Holding: Investors often sell part of their holdings to secure profits while holding most of their assets long-term (""HODLing""). Selling part of an investment doesn't necessarily reflect a lack of long-term confidence.</p></li><li><p>Sign of Market Strength: Regular profit-taking signals a healthy market environment where investors have made gains worth locking in, often a positive indicator of sustained market strength.</p></li></ul><p>In short, moderate and routine profit-taking isn't bearish by default; rather, it’s a natural and healthy aspect of market cycles.</p><p>ETH Price Prediction Disclaimer</p><p>This article provides educational insights and explains how to interpret Average Buy Profit (ABP) data for Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.
