2025-06-04T07:58:12,"HTX DeepThink: Inflation Cools and Rate-Cut Bets Rise—Why Is Crypto Still Under Pressure?","In early June, the crypto market finds itself in a delicate balance—buoyed by supportive policy signals yet constrained by tightening liquidity. Despite ongoing disinflation and rising expectations for Fed rate cuts, high-beta assets remain under short-term pressure. This week, Chloe (@ ChloeTalk1 ) from HTX Research analyzes the evolving macro liquidity landscape and market structure, breaking down the sources of Bitcoin’s resilience and the potential systemic risks facing altcoins. Global Markets React to Escalating Geopolitical Tensions Last week, President Trump announced plans to raise tariffs on imported steel and aluminum from 25% to 50%, with intentions to broaden tariffs to cover critical minerals. The European Union promptly issued warnings of retaliatory measures. Meanwhile, Ukraine launched a substantial drone strike targeting Russian air bases, significantly escalating the conflict with Russia. Amidst this intensified global geopolitical risk, demand for safe-haven assets surged, leading to a notable rise in gold prices. Despite OPEC+’s decision to increase oil production by 411,000 barrels per day starting in July, oil prices continued their upward trend, driven by supply concerns and regional instability. Core Inflation Cools, Paving the Way for Potential Fed Dovishness April PCE data showed a continued cooling in inflation, with the core PCE index decreasing to 2.5% year-over-year. This represents the lowest level since 2021,indicating that inflation is approaching the Federal Reserve’s long-term target. Meanwhile, real personal consumption growth slowed sharply from 0.7% in March to just 0.1% in April, highlighting weakening domestic demand and supporting the “soft landing” narrative. While Fed Governor Christopher Waller acknowledged the potential for tariffs to cause a temporary uptick in prices, he affirmed that a rate cut later this year remains a viable option. The market now broadly expects the first rate cut to occur in September. Bond Market Sounds Alarm as Yields Approach Critical Levels Despite recent dovish inflation data, U.S. Treasury yields have experienced a significant surge. The 30-year yield has risen to 5%, nearing its 2023 peak, while the 10-year yield has approached 4.6%. This upward movement is primarily driven by several factors: fiscal concerns surrounding a proposed tax cut package from Congress, and spillover pressure from overseas bond markets—especially a wave of selling in Japanese government bonds. This strong capital absorption by Treasuries is consequently exerting downward pressure on risk asset valuations, including Bitcoin and other high-beta digital assets. BTC Stable, Altcoins at Risk Bitcoin is currently navigating a complex environment characterized by an interplay of supportive policy developments and tightening liquidity conditions. On the positive side, accelerating regulatory progress—such as stablecoin frameworks, token legislation, and tax exemptions, along with institutional BTC purchases continue to offer strong long-term support. However, rising U.S. Treasury yields and the Treasury General Account (TGA) replenishment are draining liquidity, limiting BTC’s immediate upward trajectory and keeping its price range-bound. On-chain data shows that approximately 89% of short-term holders are still in profit, nearing historical highs and signaling a risk of profit-taking pressure. Meanwhile, around 70% of long-term holders remain in profit, suggesting overall structural resilience. The MVRV Z-Score has risen to around +1.6, reflecting an optimistic but not yet overheated market sentiment. In the derivatives market, open interest in Bitcoin futures remains elevated above $23 billion, indicating heavy leverage exposure. Furthermore, positive funding rates across major exchanges and increasing skew in the options market point to a growing demand for downside protection. Collectively, while Bitcoin remains within a medium-term bullish structure, the high concentration of short-term profits and elevated leverage suggest that near-term volatility could intensify. The market’s next directional move will likely depend on clearer macroeconomic signals. As for altcoins, their higher volatility and lack of structural support may leave them more vulnerable to broader market corrections compared to major crypto assets. *The above content is not an investment advice and does not constitute any offer or solicitation to offer or recommendation of any investment product.

2025-06-04T07:40:22,"Ripple CEO Makes Compelling Revelation That Sparks XRP Army’s Reaction","In a closed-door session in Las Vegas, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse joined renowned academic and digital finance thought leader Chris Brummer on stage to discuss the evolving strategy of Ripple and the broader implications for the crypto industry. Brummer took to X to share a detailed breakdown of the discussion, and his observations have stirred considerable interest within the XRP community and beyond. Brummer, who is widely respected for his insights into financial regulation and tokenization, offered a nuanced summary of Garlinghouse’s remarks. According to him, the Ripple chief made it clear that the firm had not pursued an acquisition of Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin. There had been previous market speculation that Ripple had floated a $10 billion offer for Circle, but Garlinghouse unequivocally dismissed that claim. However, Brummer noted that Garlinghouse left room for interpretation, possibly suggesting that while Ripple didn’t offer $10 billion, some level of exploratory engagement might have occurred. Regardless, Garlinghouse’s main point was unmistakable: Ripple has no current plans to acquire Circle, and his sentiments toward the firm were respectful but detached. 48 hours ago I joined @bgarlinghouse on stage in Las Vegas to get his thoughts on the future of @Ripple . While the session wasn’t broadcast live, I found his remarks quite interesting, and worth a tweet. Quick overview/takeaways: · Brad was unequivocal that Ripple didn't pursue… pic.twitter.com/6a3lI8DZZj — Chris Brummer (@ChrisBrummerDr) June 3, 2025 RLUSD and Ripple’s Infrastructure Ambitions Perhaps one of the most intriguing takeaways from the session was Garlinghouse’s vision for RLUSD, Ripple’s U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin. Brummer emphasized that RLUSD is not merely another stablecoin offering in an increasingly crowded space, it represents a foundational element in Ripple’s broader infrastructure play. Specifically, the stablecoin is expected to serve as on-ledger collateral for transactions, with all activities recorded immutably on the XRP Ledger. This aligns with Ripple’s longstanding commitment to building institutional-grade financial infrastructure, rather than chasing speculative hype cycles. By embedding RLUSD into the XRP Ledger as native collateral, Ripple is taking steps to enable seamless, transparent, and programmable financial services that can scale across both crypto-native and traditional financial markets. Tokenized Real Estate in the UAE Garlinghouse also revealed that Ripple is currently engaged in meaningful conversations with authorities in the United Arab Emirates around tokenized real estate projects . According to Brummer, this initiative is already in motion, not just a conceptual pitch. Tokenization, often discussed in abstract terms in Western markets, is taking on a tangible, pragmatic shape in jurisdictions like the UAE, where regulatory frameworks are more conducive to experimentation and implementation. The focus on high-value real estate assets underscores Ripple’s strategy to target prime asset classes in its tokenization endeavors. By doing so, Ripple is not only positioning the XRP Ledger as a viable platform for real-world assets (RWAs) but also strengthening its appeal to institutional investors looking to bridge traditional finance with blockchain-based efficiencies. Diplomacy in the Crypto Space The session also took a philosophical turn as Garlinghouse addressed the often-toxic culture within the crypto ecosystem. He criticized the ongoing trend of crypto projects publicly disparaging one another, warning that such behavior undermines the credibility of the entire industry. In a symbolic gesture, Ripple recently donated a replica of the Satoshi Nakamoto skull to the Bitcoin community, an act Garlinghouse described as a sincere effort to promote unity, not a marketing stunt. Brummer interpreted this gesture as an important diplomatic move, especially in an environment where tribalism often eclipses collaborative progress. Garlinghouse’s remarks struck a chord with many in the audience, particularly members of the XRP Army, who have long felt marginalized by other crypto factions despite Ripple’s pivotal role in shaping the regulatory and financial contours of blockchain adoption. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Personal Reflections on the SEC In a rare moment of candor, Garlinghouse recounted his interactions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), offering a glimpse into the personal toll the agency’s lawsuit against Ripple has taken. While he refrained from litigating the details publicly, Brummer observed a noticeable emotional intensity in his words, a reminder that the high-stakes legal battles playing out in Washington involve real people, not just corporate entities or faceless institutions. The SEC’s case against Ripple, which began in December 2020, has had far-reaching implications for the regulatory classification of digital assets. Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling was a partial victory for Ripple and the crypto industry. However, the case is not yet over. A Hybrid Future for Finance The overarching theme of Garlinghouse’s message was that Ripple is not aiming to supplant traditional finance (TradFi), but rather to integrate with it. As Brummer eloquently put it, Ripple is betting on a hybridized financial future—one where tokenized assets, stablecoins, and legacy banking institutions coexist and interoperate fluidly. This vision has profound implications for Ripple’s strategic direction. Instead of acquiring the next decentralized exchange or meme-coin platform, Ripple is likely to target key TradFi touchpoints: fiat on-ramps, payment processors, prime brokerages, and other core infrastructure providers. These are not merely “picks and shovels,” but the vital bridges that will connect the old financial world with the emerging decentralized paradigm. The XRP Community Reacts As expected, the XRP community has responded. Many members of the XRP Army took to X to express support for Ripple’s long-term vision, praising Garlinghouse’s clarity , and strategic foresight. However some raised question on the position of XRP token in the ecosystem and if the token is being implemented as bridge currecy as portraid. In an industry often driven by hype, volatility, and short-term thinking, Ripple’s consistent focus on infrastructure, regulation, and institutional collaboration stands out. The revelations from Garlinghouse’s conversation with Chris Brummer not only reaffirm Ripple’s core strategy but also offer a compelling preview of the future it envisions—a future where XRP, and the ledger it powers, play a central role in global finance.

With a unanimous 68-0 vote, the bill now heads to the Senate, and if approved, it could make California one of the most crypto-friendly states in the U.S. The bill now moves to the Senate for further consideration. JUST IN: California Assembly passes bill to allow the state to receive payments in Bitcoin and digital currencies. It passed 68-0, and now heads to the Senate. pic.twitter.com/3JWXlpuEWh — Bitcoin Laws (@Bitcoin_Laws) June 3, 2025 Crypto Payments One Step Closer to Reality AB 1180 would authorize the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) to draft rules allowing state agencies to accept cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum as payments under the Digital Financial Assets Law (DFAL). If passed by the Senate and signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, the law will take effect on July 1, 2026, with a pilot program running until January 2031. The DFPI, which oversees financial services and crypto businesses in the state, would be tasked with tracking all crypto transactions and reporting findings, including regulatory and technical issues, by 2028. This initiative follows similar moves by states like Florida, Colorado, and Louisiana, signaling a growing state-level trend toward blockchain integration. Additionally, California is the largest investor in MicroStrategy, a company known for its Bitcoin holdings , with its public pension funds holding a $276 million stake, reflecting growing institutional interest in cryptocurrency. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Is Elon Musk Buying More Bitcoin? , Bitcoin Rights on the Horizon The bill also complements AB 1052 as California’s “Bitcoin rights” bill, which passed its first committee in May with unanimous support. That bill aims to solidify crypto self-custody rights and prohibit public agencies from restricting digital assets purely for being used as payments. Together, both bills could establish a broad legal foundation for crypto use in California. With nearly 117 merchants in the state already accepting Bitcoin, this new legislation could accelerate California’s transition into a blockchain-forward economy, setting a precedent that could ripple across the nation. As terms like crypto adoption , Bitcoin payments, and crypto regulation trend, California might just lead the next wave of mainstream blockchain integration. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

OKX Announces Global Dollar (USDG) Listing: Transaction and Transfer Schedule Revealed According to the official statement made by the platform, the start of trading of USDG on the exchange and transfer transactions will take place according to the following schedule: USDG Listing Schedule: USDG deposits: June 4, 2025, 14:00 USDG/USDT pair aggregate price determination (pre-opening session): June 5, 2025, 20:00–21:00 Start of spot transactions: June 5, 2025, 21:00 Opening of withdrawal transactions: June 5, 2025, 23:00 Risk Controls for Spot Transactions In order to prevent extreme price fluctuations in new token listings, OKX will implement the following measures during the first 5 minutes: Market orders will be prohibited. Maximum transaction limit for limit orders: 10,000 USD. Net position limit per user: $10,000. These restrictions will be lifted 5 minutes after the transaction starts. In addition, the limit price mechanism to be applied in spot transactions will be activated with different algorithms until the price stability of the new token is achieved. Either the past closing price or an index will be used as the price reference. USDG/USDT Bulk Order Matching (Opening Session) The USDG/USDT pair will be available for trading with a one-hour “mass order matching” (call auction) mechanism. During this process, investors will be able to place orders at the prices they want; the system will then evaluate all orders and determine a reference opening price. Single user purchase limit: 50,000 USD Only limit orders can be placed in the last 5 minutes; cancellations or changes cannot be made. After the mass price determination, the opening price provided by the token's development team will be presented to investors for informational purposes. However, this price will not affect user orders. What is USDG? Global Dollar (USDG) is a dollar-backed stablecoin available on the Ethereum and Solana networks. Issued by regulated entities, USDG is backed by highly liquid safe assets and is convertible 1:1 to USD. USDG can be traded on various exchanges and digital wallets. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-04T07:06:40,"Could Bitcoin Replace USD? Coinbase CEO Flags Risk as US Debt Hits $37 Trillion","Key Takeaways: Coinbase CEO warns Bitcoin could replace USD as reserve currency if US debt remains unchecked. A Trump-backed spending bill faces criticism for potentially worsening the $37 trillion national debt. Bitcoin’s fixed supply and rising institutional demand are fueling its appeal as a hedge against fiscal instability. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has warned that Bitcoin could eventually replace the USD as the world’s reserve currency if lawmakers fail to address America’s spiraling debt. “I love Bitcoin, but a strong America is also super important for the world,” Armstrong posted on X Tuesday. “We need to get our finances under control.” The U.S. national debt recently crossed $37 trillion, adding fresh urgency to concerns about long-term fiscal stability. If the electorate doesn't hold congress accountable to reducing the deficit, and start paying down the debt, Bitcoin is going to take over as reserve currency. I love Bitcoin, but a strong America is also super important for the world. We need to get our finances under control. https://t.co/aeBE7pUuHo — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) June 4, 2025 Trump-Backed Spending Bill Advances as US Debt Worries Mount Armstrong’s comments come as House Republicans advance a Trump-backed spending bill that extends tax cuts, boosts military funding, and slashes programs like Medicaid, food aid, and clean energy. Critics argue the legislation would worsen the debt outlook. A group of six Nobel Prize-winning economists, including Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz, warned in a June letter that the bill could push public debt even higher, by at least $3 trillion, if its provisions are made permanent. The growing debt burden is drawing new attention to Bitcoin, which was designed after the 2008 financial crisis as a fixed-supply, inflation-resistant asset. With institutional demand rising, some analysts say BTC is becoming an increasingly credible hedge. Tesla CEO Elon Musk also weighed in, blasting the spending bill as a “massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill” and a “disgusting abomination.” It will massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit to $2.5 trillion (!!!) and burden America citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt https://t.co/dHCj3pprJO — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 3, 2025 US Eyes Bitcoin Reserve to Tackle Soaring Debt With the U.S. national debt now exceeding $37 trillion, lawmakers are floating bold new ideas to stabilize the country’s finances — and Bitcoin may soon play a central role. Last year, Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced a proposal to establish a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, positioning the cryptocurrency as a hedge against inflation and fiscal instability. The bill, which gained fresh momentum after Donald Trump’s 2024 election victory, would direct the U.S. Treasury to gradually accumulate 1 million BTC — approximately 5% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Modeled after the government’s gold reserves, the Bitcoin would be stored across a decentralized network of secure vaults, with purchases funded by existing Treasury assets. Lummis argued that the Bitcoin reserve could help offset the declining value of the dollar and protect American families from the long-term effects of inflation. “We must take bold steps to secure our economic future,” she said, calling Bitcoin a modern store of value. Trump has previously pledged to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet,” with Bitcoin now emerging as a potential pillar of national economic strategy. The post Could Bitcoin Replace USD?

2025-06-04T07:04:20,"Fundstrat’s Tom Lee Unveils Astronomical Bitcoin Price Target, Says BTC Witnessing ‘Huge’ Supply-Demand Imbalance","Investor Tom Lee believes that Bitcoin ( BTC ) will reach his ambitious price target over a long arc of time. In a new CNBC interview, Fundstrat’s CIO says Bitcoin looks poised to hit new all-time highs this year, driven by an expanding global money supply. According to Lee, he expects Bitcoin to surge by at least 41% from current levels before the year expires. “Bitcoin is responding to global liquidity, which is moving up. And I think it’s anticipating a dovish Fed next year, so that’s a tailwind for Bitcoin. Bitwise has a great stat: 95% of all Bitcoin has been mined, but 95% of the world doesn’t own Bitcoin. So I just think that there’s still a huge demand versus supply imbalance, meaning there’s a lot more potential buyers of Bitcoin over the next 10 years. So I think there’s a lot of upside to year-end… Yeah, [I got a target] of $150,000, maybe $200,000 or even $250,000 this year.” But over an extended period of time, Lee sees Bitcoin catching up to or even surpassing the market cap of gold, ultimately leading to a massive price tag for BTC. “I think at a minimum, it should have the same network value as gold, and if you look at above-ground gold, it’s probably $23 trillion, so that would $1.2 million for Bitcoin. But I think Bitcoin is more valuable than gold. Bitcoin could be $2 million, $3 million long term, even higher.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $105,900.

2025-06-04T07:00:20,"TRON Activity Hits All-Time High, Is a TRX Price Breakout Coming?","TRON (TRX) is seeing a continued lift in price alongside broader gains across the crypto market. As of today, TRX is trading just above $0.27, marking a 1.2% increase over the past 24 hours. The move reflects a coordinated uptick in digital asset valuations, with the global cryptocurrency market capitalization climbing nearly 1% to a current total of approximately $3.47 trillion. This price action comes as on-chain data suggests increased user engagement on the TRON network. Related Reading: Analyst Explains Reason Behind Tron Price Sluggishness — Are TRX Bears Now In Control? According to recent analysis shared on CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, a steady rise in daily active addresses is being observed, with both the 50-day and 100-day moving averages for this metric reaching all-time highs. The sustained increase in network activity points to a potentially supportive backdrop for TRX’s current momentum. TRX Hits $121.2B Monthly Transfer Volume — New All-Time High “TRX reached a new ATH in total transfer volume, both in terms of TRX and USD value. Over the course of the month, a total of 490.3 billion TRX was transferred.” – By @JA_Maartun Full post ⤵️https://t.co/zJUt0EruNI pic.twitter.com/6yrDUUjTJb — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 2, 2025 User Engagement and Moving Averages Signal Strong Network Activity CryptoQuant contributor “CryptoOnchain” reported that the moving averages of daily active addresses on TRON have reached unprecedented levels. The 50-day and 100-day metrics, which smooth out short-term fluctuations to show longer-term engagement trends, are currently at their highest points since tracking began. Historically, sustained increases in this metric have preceded upward price movement in TRX, though the price growth has yet to fully reflect the spike in activity. The analyst also emphasized that while TRX has been rising, the network’s user participation appears to be outpacing the token’s market performance. This divergence suggests that underlying demand is building, potentially laying the groundwork for future gains if the trend continues. Meanwhile, traders often view network activity as a leading indicator of value in proof-of-stake chains like TRON, where user interaction can drive both sentiment and transaction volume. SunPump Token Activity Emerges as TRON Price Indicator In a separate CryptoQuant post, analyst “BorisVest” highlighted the role of SunPump tokens in shaping TRON’s price dynamics. SunPump is a tool used for creating tokens on the TRON network, and its activity appears to correlate with TRX market trends. According to the analysis, periods of intense token creation, often driven by hype, bots, or speculative launches, can signal short-term tops in TRX price, especially if the token’s value doesn’t keep pace with the burst in network activity. Related Reading: TRON’s Correlation With Bitcoin Could Mean Massive Gains, Here’s Why Conversely, when activity on SunPump slows down, TRX has historically drifted lower toward local bottoms, often indicating reduced selling pressure. More stable growth in token creation, when aligned with a gradual rise in TRX price, has been associated with healthier and more sustained rallies. BorisVest suggests that tracking these token dynamics can provide insights into TRON’s market rhythm, offering a potential framework for identifying accumulation zones or overheated conditions.

The XVG price may reach a potential high of about $0.34 in 2025. The future growth prospects of XVG tokens are heavily dependent on the specific project developments, market dynamics, and the broader crypto market’s trend. The Verge (XVG) token has continued to prioritize user privacy and fast transactions in the past decade of its existence. The open-source project secured through a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism has, however, faced intense competition in recent years from emerging layer one (L1) chains offering more intrinsic features to the users. Nevertheless, the Verge network offers a privacy-focused transaction, with cheap prices, which is heavily associated with widespread adoption by speculative crypto traders. If the Verge team secures successful partnerships and adopts smart contract functionality in the near future, XVG price will continue to record bullish sentiment.

2025-06-04T06:25:56,"Bitcoin Traders Are Watching These Levels for Cues on Downside Risk","Crypto markets are giving no return opportunities for intraday traders, but long-term market watchers say the market is in a coiled spot and key levels are to be monitored for moves on either side. Bitcoin BTC hovered just above $105,000 on Wednesday, showing a steady rise from earlier in the week. Ether ETH, Cardano’s ADA ADA, dogecoin DOGE and XRP XRP showed returns under 1%. Overall market capitalization declined 1.8%. Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, said the market’s shift in sentiment reflected a sense that trade tensions, and that the drag on risk assets may have been priced in. “While the U.S. economy shows signs of contraction, investors are optimistic on tech, especially on the future outlook of Bitcoin as institutions continue to integrate further with the industry,” Ruck said, adding that despite inflation risks and uncertain macro policies, the crypto market’s long-term trajectory remains positive. Bitcoin’s price action over the past week has been telling. According to data from Fineqia research analyst Matteo Greco, BTC ended last week week around $105,700, down 3.1% from the previous week’s close near $109,050. This came as BTC spot ETFs saw $150 million in net outflows in the the first negative print after six consecutive weeks of inflows. “BTC reserves on exchanges continue to decline, while reserves for major altcoins such as ETH and XRP have stabilised,” Greco wrote in an email to CoinDesk. Stablecoin reserves on exchanges have reached their highest levels in years, he added, a sign that investors may be preparing to deploy fresh capital rather than exiting the market. Greco added that bitcoin’s market-value-to-realised-value (MVRV) ratio currently stands at around 2.2, below the historical top threshold of 3.7. That suggests we’re in the late stages of the cycle — but not at the peak yet. Bitunix analysts pointed to the Fed’s dovish comments as a short-term boost to risk appetite, though they warned that dollar volatility could disrupt flows. “Bitcoin’s short-term key level is at $105,000,” they said. “If it can hold above this level, it may continue to rise. Conversely, if the market shifts back to risk aversion, the key support level at $102,700 must be defended.” As such, analysts say that if Bitcoin’s dominance begins to fade, historically a sign of late-cycle rotation, altcoins could gain momentum, marking the later innings of a bull market. With stablecoin reserves rising and institutions continuing to integrate Bitcoin into their strategies, traders are bracing for what could be a volatile but potentially lucrative summer. We’re hoping that the positive trend for the crypto markets continues for the long run,” LVRG’s Ruck said.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/04/bitcoin-traders-are-watching-these-levels-for-cues-on-downside-risk,"ADA|ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|XRP","Markets|Bitcoin|market analysis|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-04T06:20:36,"The California Assembly passed the Bitcoin payments bill AB 1180 with 60-0 votes","The California State Assembly unanimously passed a bill, AB 1180, on June 4 with 68 votes in favor, allowing the state government to accept Bitcoin and other digital assets as payment methods. The crypto payment bill is now under review by the state Senate. The bill requires the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) to submit a report to the Legislature on or before January 1, 2028. The report should contain the number and value of cryptocurrency transactions processed, the technical and regulatory challenges encountered, and recommendations for payments under other laws and to other state government agencies to be made using digital financial assets. According to official documents, the bill will sunset on July 1, 2031. Crypto payment bill aims to modernize state payment solutions 🇺🇸 JUST IN: California Assembly passes bill to allow the state to receive payments in Bitcoin and digital currencies. It passed 68-0, and now heads to the Senate. pic.twitter.com/3JWXlpuEWh — Bitcoin Laws (@Bitcoin_Laws) June 3, 2025 The legislation establishes the Digital Financial Assets Law (DFAL), which is a licensing and regulatory framework administered by the DFPI for digital financial asset activity. The bill also prohibits an individual from engaging in digital financial asset business activity without a license from DFPI on or after July 1, 2025. Member of the State Assembly Avelino Valencia, who presented the bill, acknowledged that it was a first-of-its-kind initiative. He noted that the AB 1180 bill would establish a pilot program authorizing the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) to allow for the payment of fees using digital finance assets. “Very excited about this. Having gone to school at San Jose State during the time that this technology was being created, I firmly believe this will be fully integrated into our society in the near future.” – Avelino Valencia , Member of the California State Assembly. Valencia championed the initiative, emphasizing its strategic importance in modernizing payment systems. Bitcoin advocate and political strategist Dennis Porter welcomed the Assembly’s move as a significant milestone in cryptocurrency acceptance in government transactions. Valencia noted that AB 1180 requires a licensee to maintain specific records related to digital financial asset business activity with a California resident for five years after the date of the transaction. It also prohibits a covered person from exchanging, transferring, or storing a stablecoin or engaging in digital financial asset administration unless the issuer of the stablecoin is a licensee, a person who applies for a license, a bank, or a California or federal trust. The legislation also provides that specified sections of the DFAL related to disclosures, consumer protections, and stablecoin requirements will be operative on July 1, 2025. According to Valencia, AB 1180 will ensure that the process and challenges of paying state fees with cryptocurrencies can be studied and improved upon. He also expects the bill to keep pace with evolving consumer preferences since Colorado, Utah, and Louisiana already accept crypto payments. Legislation faces hurdles in converting crypto to fiat We are getting a payment provider to accept crypto equivalent and deposit the dollars into the state’s treasury for that amount. It is kind of like credit card payments, with the bonus that there are no returned payments! pic.twitter.com/H8MaFV1ojE — Governor Jared Polis (@GovofCO) February 23, 2022 The California Blockchain Advocacy Coalition argued that all states accepting cryptocurrency convert it into dollars using a payment processor, which adds additional charges. The coalition noted that Colorado uses PayPal payment processing, which charges a $1 service fee to convert crypto into dollars, plus 1.83% of the payment amount, and requires the use of PayPal Currency Hub. The trade association noted that the State of California is not set up to accept digital asset payments. It also acknowledged that there is no mechanism to convert cryptocurrency payments to dollars, which is the basis of the state budget. Previous legislation allowing the use of cryptocurrency for state payments failed. The bill includes AB 953, which requires the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration to accept stablecoins for tax payments from licensed cannabis businesses. The legislation was referred to Assembly Banking and Finance and Revenue and Taxation but was gut and amended related to land use. The AB 3090 bill requires the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration to issue and deliver to the Legislature a report on how the state, cities, and counties could receive any cannabis tax amounts through stablecoin transactions but failed to go through. SB 1275 also authorizes a state agency to accept digital assets as a payment method to provide government services. The legislation failed to pass out of the Senate.

2025-06-04T06:13:18,"Will XRP Dominate 2025? Recent Shocking Ripple Price Predictions","TL;DR Ripple’s native token has underperformed over the past few weeks, dropping below a crucial support zone of around $2.3, which has now become resistance. However, this hasn’t deterred some of the most vocal members of the XRP Army from setting out big, and perhaps outrageously sounding, price predictions. Here are some of them. Moonshot Not Far Away? Citing their own forecasts based on the Fibonacci pattern, CryptoBilbuwoo0 noted that the day when XRP heads to the moon is “not far away.” The analyst also noted XRP’s previous performance when the asset peaked at around $3.3, which was inches away from the 2018 all-time high, and posted the next targets. They range from more modest $4.29 and $6.78 to some quite bullish of around $26.6-$28.8 and go all the way into the land of insanity – $589 and $1458.3. While we are still on the island of massive price predictions, which would require a mindblowing surge and outplacing heavyweights like BTC, Apple, Amazon, and many others, here’s another example. JackTheRippler, among the biggest XRP bulls, outlined a rumor that the GENIUS stablecoin act can somehow take the token’s price to $250. How will that happen remains undisclosed; perhaps it’s somehow related to Ripple’s own stablecoin (RLUSD), but we will have to wait and see. BarriC also headed to the same island, saying that $10 is just the beginning of an explosive price action. Moreover, the analyst put a slightly bigger target for Ripple’s coin that contains two more zeros at the end. $XRP to $10 is just the beginning of the explosive price action we will see for #XRP $XRP to $1,000 is where $XRP is heading in the near future — BarriC (@B_arri_C) June 3, 2025 Some of these targets might sound outrageous, to say the least, given the necessary market cap growth XRP has to experience to reach a token price of $10, $100, or even $1,000. Just for instance, its market cap would need to explode to around $500 billion if XRP taps $10, given today’s circulation, and you can do your calculations for the other targets. This would make it a lot bigger than ETH. Here’s what ChatGPT thinks about the viability of XRP surging to such heights. XRP to Dominate 2025 XRP DRAGON was also bullish on the asset’s future price trajectory, indicating that people have “a few days left to accumulate XRP at cheap price of $2-$2.3.” After that, Ripple’s token will “dominate this year,” and they exemplified it with a big green prediction candle. $XRP will dominate this year That gives everyone a few days left to accumulate #XRP at the cheap price of $2-$2.30 Once we get to the second week of June 2025 we will experience the beginning of the biggest alt season anyone has ever seen That’s when we see the next god… pic.twitter.com/mDCAYjBcv2 — XRP DRAGON (@DRAGON_XRP66) June 4, 2025 After posting all of these massive price predictions, it is essential to note that they are nothing more than just that – merely predictions. We are not saying they are impossible, as the crypto market has seen some wild things in the past, but investors should conduct their own thorough research and not rely blindly on online forecasts.

2025-06-04T06:07:44,"Is Elon Musk Buying More Bitcoin?","The post Is Elon Musk Buying More Bitcoin? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Elon Musk’s fiery reaction to a controversial Republican-backed spending bill has reignited speculation that Tesla may increase its Bitcoin holdings. His comment comes shortly after Trump gave Musk a public Oval Office send-off, ending his role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) . The bill, which proposes massive tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy, is expected to add $3.8 trillion to the U.S. national debt over the next decade. XRP advocate John Deaton believes this economic direction could encourage Musk and Tesla to adopt Bitcoin further. Elon and Tesla already hold 11,509k BTC; based on Deaton’s prediction, they could add more BTC as a hedge against government spending. Wouldn’t be surprised to see Elon and Tesla buy more Bitcoin. The Big Beautiful Bill is a walking billboard and advertisement for buying Bitcoin. https://t.co/29mGiAptR4 — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) June 3, 2025 A Billboard for Bitcoin? Deaton, who has previously taken on crypto-skeptic lawmakers like Senator Elizabeth Warren, didn’t mince words. He called the bill a “walking advertisement for Bitcoin,” implying that continued inflation and reckless fiscal policies could make decentralized assets more attractive to institutions like Tesla. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Elon Musk Slams ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ as a Path to U.S. Bankruptcy , Musk himself didn’t hold back, labeling the bill a “disgusting abomination.” Senator Rand Paul also agreed with Elon Musk, highlighting concerns about an additional $5 trillion in debt and wasteful government spending. Though the bill still faces significant hurdles in the Senate, its potential to worsen inflation has raised alarm bells even among traditional economists. Notably, gold advocate Peter Schiff warned the bill would drive inflation higher by deepening deficits and weakening the dollar. Thank you Elon. You are absolutely right. I really appreciate your calling attention to this fraud. Hopefully you can influence the President to veto the bill if it passes the Senate in its current form, or anything close to it. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) June 3, 2025 Adding to that, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene raised an issue about a provision, apparently on pages 278-279 of the bill, that would prevent states from regulating Artificial Intelligence (AI) for 10 years. She’s concerned this infringes on states’ rights and gives too much control over AI to the federal government, especially when the full capabilities of AI aren’t yet understood. Tesla’s Bitcoin History Tesla first made headlines with a $1.5 billion Bitcoin investment in 2021. While the company has sold portions of that stash, it still holds approximately $1.2 billion in BTC, according to Arkham Intelligence . Musk hasn’t hinted directly at new purchases, but with inflation concerns mounting and fiat skepticism growing, analysts say the door is open for Tesla to reload. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

On June 3, NYSE Arca submitted a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on behalf of crypto asset manager Yorkville America Digital, a partner of Trump Media & Technology Group, which owns Truth Social. Although Trump transferred ownership of the media group to a trust controlled by his son, Donald Trump Jr., he is still its majority owner. The proposed ETF seeks to track the price of Bitcoin and will be listed on NYSE Arca, with Foris DAX Trust Company—custodian of Crypto.com’s assets—named as the intended custodian. Key details like the fund's ticker and management fee were not shared. If approved, the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF will enter an increasingly competitive landscape that is currently dominated by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). The move is seen as further intertwining Trump’s brand with the crypto sector, which already includes several non-fungible token (NFT) projects, a stablecoin, multiple meme coins, a mining firm, and a tokenized crypto platform. Critics argue that ventures like these raise questions about conflicts of interest with Trump’s political role. The ETF application follows an April agreement between Trump Media, Yorkville, and Crypto.com to roll out a range of “Made in America” crypto ETFs. The new filing triggers the SEC’s formal review process, which gives the agency 45 days to respond with an approval, rejection, or delay. However, the review period can be extended for up to 240 days, setting a final deadline of Jan. 29, 2026. Yorkville must also submit an S-1 registration statement with details about how the ETF will function as well as risks to investors. This is not Trump Media’s first attempt to enter the ETF space. The company previously filed for a “Truth.Fi Bitcoin Plus ETF” in February, and allocated up to $250 million to its fintech platform Truth.Fi . Beyond ETFs, the firm also plans to integrate crypto into its digital ecosystem. CEO Devin Nunes revealed in April that Trump Media is working on a crypto wallet and utility token for its video streaming site, Truth+, which will allow users to pay for subscriptions and other services on the platform. US Military Leaders Back Bitcoin Reserve The deepening ties between the crypto space and US leadership became even more clear after Senator Cynthia Lummis recently revealed that certain factions in the American military are in favor of creating a national Bitcoin reserve. They see it as a crucial strategic asset in the face of rising economic and geopolitical tensions. In a June 3 interview with Bloomberg, Lummis shared that some US generals—particularly those stationed in Southeast Asia—have expressed strong support for Bitcoin as a form of economic defense in the increasingly volatile global landscape. According to Lummis, these military leaders believe that Bitcoin could play a pivotal role in strengthening America’s position in what she referred to as “economic war” with China, She also believes that preparation for traditional military conflict should go hand-in-hand with readiness in the digital and financial arenas. “There are generals, especially in Southeast Asia, who believe it’s important to have a strategic Bitcoin stockpile because we’re doing an economic war with China and we have to prepare for a guns and bullets war. But we need both,” Lummis stated during the interview. Her comments reflect the growing belief among some US policymakers and defense strategists that Bitcoin and other decentralized technologies may become essential tools in the modern geopolitical toolkit. This discussion happened amid heightened scrutiny of the US-China relationship, which has been riddled by trade wars, tech competition, and diverging policies on digital assets. While the US is increasingly warming up to Bitcoin as part of its economic strategy, China enforced a strict ban on all cryptocurrency-related activities since 2021. Despite this, China continues to invest heavily in blockchain innovation through its central bank digital currency, the digital yuan. President Donald Trump clearly declared his ambition to make the US the “ world capital of crypto ,” and also pointed out that failure to lead could result in China overtaking the space. US Vice President JD Vance spoke at Bitcoin 2025, and also spoke about the idea that America’s dominance in the crypto sector is key to its future competitiveness on the global stage. Vice President JD Vance speaking at Bitcoin 2025 Bitcoin Miner Cango Reports Massive Production Surge In other Bitcoin-related news, mining firm Cango reported a big boost in production after fully pivoting to crypto mining. In fact, the firm generated almost $100.5 million worth of Bitcoin in just two months. According to a June 3 announcement , the company mined a total of 954.5 BTC during April and May, with 470 BTC mined in April and 484.5 BTC in May. This production surge happened after Cango’s decision in early April to sell off its legacy operations in China to an entity linked to mining giant Bitmain, which started its complete strategic shift toward Bitcoin mining. Announcement from Cango The company has been rapidly scaling up its mining capabilities, operating at an average hashrate of almost 30 exahashes per second across April and May. In Bitcoin mining, hashrate represents the number of cryptographic computations a miner can perform each second. It is essentially the number of “guesses” it can make to find a valid block hash. A higher hashrate increases the chances of successfully validating a block and earning the Bitcoin reward under the network’s proof-of-work consensus mechanism. This recent mining output comes on the heels of a strong first quarter , during which Cango reported having mined 1,541 BTC, worth approximately $162 million at the time. The company’s focus on scaling its hashrate seems to be paying off. Additionally, Cango’s co-founders, Xiaojun Zhang and Jiayuan Lin, agreed to sell 10 million of their high-vote Class B shares to Enduring Wealth Capital for $70 million, pending shareholder approval. These shares carry 20 votes each, and will retain their voting power, while the founders plan to convert their remaining Class B shares to standard one-vote Class A stock. If the deal goes through, Enduring Wealth Capital will assume voting control of the company with over half the total votes. However, the firm will hold less than 5% of the company’s economic equity, or under 37% in the event Cango issues additional stock tied to mining rig acquisitions.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9422/truth-social-bitcoin-etf-filing-submitted-to-the-sec,"ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|REGULATION","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-06-04T06:00:41,"Blockchain Group Buys 624 Bitcoin For $68.6M, Aiming To Join Top Institutional Holders","Blockchain Group has just taken another big step in building its Bitcoin stash. The Paris-listed firm picked up 624 BTC on Tuesday in a deal worth $68.6 million. Based on reports, that move pushes its total holdings to 1,437 BTC—now valued around $150 million. It’s clear the company wants to be known as a heavyweight when it comes to holding Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Accelerated Bitcoin Purchases Since late 2024, Blockchain Group has been buying Bitcoin in stages. Starting with 15 BTC for $1.1 million in November 2024, then adding 25 BTC the next month, the firm was easing its way in. The Blockchain Group confirms the acquisition of 624 BTC for ~€60.2 million, the holding of a total of 1,471 BTC, and a BTC Yield of 1,097.6% YTD Full Press Release (EN): https://t.co/iZUEbRaDTZ Full Press Release (FR): https://t.co/IgTddli8Hu BTC Strategy (EN):… pic.twitter.com/0bQ9zaSRN3 — The Blockchain Group (@_ALTBG) June 3, 2025 On March 26, they stepped up by buying 580 BTC. Then, on May 22, another 227 BTC went into their wallet. These steady buys show a growing appetite for Bitcoin as a core asset. The latest 624 cryptocurrency buy is their biggest single haul yet. It’s a clear sign the group wants to make Bitcoin a foundation in its treasury. Funding Through Convertible Bonds Most of the recent Bitcoin buy—544 BTC—was funded by a $63 million convertible bond issued to Fulgur Ventures. Based on reports, the bond allows Blockchain Group to convert debt into shares later, if investors choose. The rest—80 BTC—came from an almost $10 million capital raise completed in late May. That cash was specifically earmarked for crypto acquisition. Using debt and fresh capital, the firm seems bent on scaling up its Bitcoin holdings quickly. It also shows they’d rather raise funds than tap into existing cash reserves. Custody And Partnerships Blockchain Group worked with Banque Delubac & Cie and Swissquote Bank Europe to execute the BTC purchase. Both institutions partnered with Swiss firm Taurus to handle secure custody of the coins. According to the company, using trusted custodians is key to keeping the digital assets safe. With these partnerships in place, Blockchain Group doesn’t need to worry about managing private keys on its own. That lets them focus on buying more Bitcoin instead of dealing with technical security issues. Risk And Rewards For Shares At current prices, the firm’s 1,437 BTC is worth a little over $150 million. As of May 31, the group reported an unrealized gain of nearly $48 million. That’s a healthy return on the earlier buys. But Bitcoin’s price swings can be sharp. If BTC drops, those paper gains could vanish fast. Plus, issuing a $63 million convertible bond means possible share dilution if bondholders convert to equity. Reports disclose that Blockchain Group plans to boost its “Bitcoin per share” figure through more targeted capital raises tied to crypto buys. The big bet is that Bitcoin’s price will keep climbing, making these purchases worthwhile. Yet, if the market takes a downturn, investors could see both coin values and share prices slip.

2025-06-04T06:00:18,"Bitcoin Derivatives Reset: Neutral Funding And Whale Withdrawals Hint At Bullish Shift","As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to hover near its all-time high (ATH) of $111,814, signs of a reset in the derivatives market are emerging. One such indicator is the Binance Liquidation Delta, which is showing a consistent pattern of large-scale long position liquidations. Bitcoin Late-Long Positions Get Wiped Out According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by analyst Amr Taha, Binance’s BTC derivatives market is currently experiencing a significant reset. The Binance Liquidation Delta reveals that liquidations of long positions, sometimes exceeding $40 million, are repeatedly disrupting the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Selling Pressure Weak As Binance Inflows Stay Subdued – Can BTC Sustain Its Rally? For the uninitiated, the Binance Liquidation Delta measures the difference between long and short liquidations on Binance’s futures market. A negative delta means more long positions are being forcibly closed, often indicating bearish pressure or a leverage reset. On the contrary, a positive delta suggests more short positions are getting liquidated, which can signal a bullish short squeeze. The following chart highlights repeated spikes in long liquidations – shown in green – occurring at hourly intervals. While some short liquidations are also present, they are far less significant in magnitude. Taha noted a key detail that despite the consistent flushing of long positions, funding rates on Binance remain neutral, hovering around zero. This indicates a lack of extreme sentiment – neither overly bullish nor bearish – implying that traders are cautiously reassessing their positions rather than panicking. In parallel, whale activity signals accumulation rather than capitulation. Most notably, Bitfinex saw its largest single-day BTC withdrawal since August 2019, as 20,000 BTC was pulled from the exchange. Taha commented: This transaction, valued at over $1.3 billion based on current prices, indicates that such large-scale withdrawals often reflect long-term holding strategies, thereby alleviating immediate selling pressure on exchanges. Considering the neutral funding environment, persistent long liquidations, and substantial whale outflows, the analyst suggested that Bitcoin may be positioning for another upward move – potentially to a new ATH. New ATH On The Horizon For BTC? At the time of writing, BTC is trading 5.8% below its ATH. However, several technical and on-chain indicators hint at further upside for the world’s largest digital asset by market cap. Related Reading: Bitcoin Surges With Low Retail Interest – Is A Second Wave Coming? For instance, CryptoQuant contributor ibrahimcosar recently projected a price target of $112,000 following a bullish double bottom breakout. Additionally, Coinbase recently recorded a 7,883 BTC withdrawal, suggesting that institutional investors may be positioning for the next leg up. That said, some warning signs persist. For example, recent on-chain data shows that long-term BTC holders are reducing their exposure to the digital asset, likely in anticipation of a price correction. At press time, BTC trades at $105,308, up 1.4% in the past 24 hours.

2025-06-04T05:54:21,"Week in GameFi: Markets Slump, Wynn Liquidated, but Bright Spots Remain","The Web3 gaming sector took a hit this week as bearish momentum swept through the broader crypto market. GameFi saw its total market capitalization tumble by 13%, accompanied by a 21% drop in trading volume. With Bitcoin pulling back to around $106,000 and sentiment turning cautious, several high-profile events sent shockwaves through the ecosystem — none more dramatic than the $100 million liquidation of prominent investor James Wynn. A handful of high-profile projects managing to keep some semblance of forward momentum, sometimes even growing and expanding, in this market is surprising to see. From a recent unexpected rise by Undeads Games (UDS) right on down to a big Sony blockchain integration, GameFi remains a space full of excitement and tension. Bearish Winds Hit GameFi Hard The sell-off in GameFi closely tracked the price dip in Bitcoin. As the price of Bitcoin slipped, so did the values assigned to digital collectibles and other assets within the GameFi universe. Ironically, even as GameStop announced its acquisition of 4,710 BTC, the market didn’t pay much attention and continued its downward trajectory. Meanwhile, the story circulated about James Wynn’s $100 million position in Bitcoin that had been heavily margined, or on leverage. When Wynn’s liquidation hit the news, it appeared to confirm the skeptics’ thesis about the ongoing underdevelopment of the GameFi sector. As risk hunger diminished, industry-wide red ink ensued. Activity in trading ground to a slow pace, and all eyes diverted back toward secure assets amid an ever-growing uncertainty bubble. The latest downturn for GameFi isn’t solely the result of some sins committed within. It’s also riding the wave of an altcoin dip — one that’s so bad, the Altcoin Season Index dropped from 28 to 22. That means Bitcoin is now, more than ever, in the driver’s seat for market direction. GameFi’s ascension to the 13th position on DeFiLlama’s protocol tracker may look like advancement, but it is not. This move up the charts occurred less from GameFi’s organic growth and more because other sectors of the crypto world fell even harder. In short, GameFi’s relative position improved. However, the fundamentals of GameFi didn’t get any better. Undeads Games Shocks Market With +75% Surge A handful of projects managed to stay in the latest bear market. Undeads Games (UDS), was the clear standout with a wild uptick of 75.51%. What was driving demand for UDS? Speculation and a monster upcoming beta launch in January. Add to this fearless trading activity and investors eyeing the possible value of an upcoming airdrop and you remind the market that GameFi has both speculative and enduring growth potential. UDS wasn’t solitary in defying the trend. MYRIA similarly attracted attention with a 40.29% increase, spurred on by engagement from the community and fresh developments in the ecosystem. At the same time, MASK maintained its ascent with a 15.13% rise , marking off yet another week in the green and gaining traction among play-to-earn aficionados. These individual victories, though commendable, hardly made a dent in the overall decline. The majority of GameFi tokens continued to struggle, and many low-cap projects couldn’t seem to attract any attention at all in this trading strategy environment. Right now, GameFi seems to be clustering together a series of quite rare successes. Week in GameFi: Hard To Wynn as Bears Bring Down Market. GameFi tanks 13% as BTC cools off! Wynn gets liquidated for $100M! UDS defies gravity with a 75% rally! Sleepagotchi taps Sony’s blockchain! Let’s unpack this week’s Web3 gaming shake-up 1/6 pic.twitter.com/0nJOsdoAgW — CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) June 2, 2025 Sony Partnership Boosts Sleepagotchi’s Reach One of the week’s most hopeful developments came from the Sleep-to-Earn sector, where Sleepagotchi disclosed an important integration with Sony’s blockchain platform, Soneium. The lite version of Sleepagotchi has officially launched on Line, tapping into an enormous user base of over 200 million people. This partnership isn’t just about distribution — it’s also about ecosystem evolution. Users on Line now have early access to a new points system tied to the upcoming Sleepagotchi 2.0 app. This kind of infrastructure-level integration with a global tech giant like Sony signals a maturation of the Web3 gaming narrative. It also provides a fresh use case for blockchain in wellness and gamified lifestyle apps, sectors that continue to draw both attention and innovation. The partnership might signify a pivotal moment for GameFi’s aspirations to go mainstream. As established technology and social media companies explore decentralized ecosystems, projects that serve a demonstrable real-world purpose — as opposed to simply being the next hot speculative thing — tend to have a thriving outlook. GameFi is not a currently thriving ecosystem, especially since the top play-to-earn project, Axie Infinity, has become an example more of what not to do than what to emulate. Final Thoughts: Reminding that GameFi is still a very volatile, high-stakes arena, this past week saw a push-back against the overall market that had previously seemed to be moving toward a recovery. Even as sentiment tilted decidedly bearish, nevertheless, some individual stories still managed to find their way toward being upbeat. UDS, for instance— previously a deeply obscure project— saw its tokens rally this week; and Sleepagotchi was busy integrating with Sony. What these individual success stories mostly illustrate, though, is the current fragility of the GameFi sector. It’s hard to see sustainable recovery unless and until Bitcoin finds true price stability and the whole altcoin confidence thing returns. Until then, a handful of GameFi tokens still seem to be getting pumped. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

2025-06-04T05:50:36,"Bitcoin ETF: Truth Social Files for Strategic Spot Offering","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin ETF: Truth Social Files for Strategic Spot Offering In a move that’s certainly raising eyebrows across both the financial and social media landscapes, Truth Social, the platform established by Trump Media & Technology Group, has officially filed documents proposing the listing and trading of a spot Bitcoin ETF . This development, initially reported by Unfolded via X, signals a potentially significant step for the company and offers a fascinating twist in the ongoing story of cryptocurrency adoption. What’s Behind the Headline? Truth Social’s Dive into the Bitcoin ETF Space The core of the news is the filing itself. While details are still emerging, the filing indicates Truth Social’s intention to bring a managed Spot Bitcoin ETF to market. For those unfamiliar, Truth Social launched in 2022, positioning itself as a platform for free expression, primarily associated with former President Donald Trump and his supporters. Its parent company, Trump Media , has recently been in the news following its public listing. But why would a social media company venture into the complex world of financial products like a Crypto ETF ? Several potential motivations could be at play: Business Diversification: Expanding revenue streams beyond advertising or subscription models. Tapping into User Base Interest: Many individuals interested in alternative platforms may also have an affinity for alternative assets like Bitcoin. Leveraging Brand Recognition: Capitalizing on the public profile of Trump Media and its associated figures to attract investment. Strategic Positioning: Aligning the company with emerging financial technology and digital assets. This filing positions Truth Social not just as a media company but potentially as a player in the digital asset investment arena, a pivot that few would have anticipated. Understanding the Significance: Why a Spot Bitcoin ETF Matters The term “ Spot Bitcoin ETF ” has been a hot topic in finance for years, especially after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finally approved several such funds earlier in 2024. Here’s a quick breakdown of why they are important: A Spot Bitcoin ETF holds actual Bitcoin as its underlying asset. This is different from futures-based ETFs, which track the price of Bitcoin futures contracts. Key advantages of a Spot Bitcoin ETF include: Accessibility: Allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements through traditional brokerage accounts, without needing to buy, store, or secure Bitcoin directly. Simplicity: Integrates Bitcoin investment into existing investment frameworks like IRAs or 401(k)s. Regulatory Oversight: ETFs are regulated financial products, offering a layer of investor protection not always present when dealing directly with crypto exchanges. Liquidity: ETFs trade on major stock exchanges, generally offering high liquidity. The approval of the first batch of Spot Bitcoin ETF s was seen as a watershed moment for mainstream crypto adoption. Now, new players like Truth Social potentially entering the fray adds another layer to this evolving market. The Road Ahead: Navigating Regulatory Hurdles for the Crypto ETF Filing for a Bitcoin ETF is just the first step in a potentially long and complex process. The proposal must undergo scrutiny and approval by the SEC. The SEC’s primary mandate is investor protection, and they evaluate ETF proposals based on several factors, including: Market Surveillance Sharing Agreements: Ensuring mechanisms are in place to prevent market manipulation. Custody Arrangements: How the underlying Bitcoin will be securely stored. Valuation Methodologies: How the ETF’s net asset value will be accurately calculated. Liquidity and Redemption Mechanisms: How investors can buy and sell shares and how the fund handles creations and redemptions. While the SEC has approved spot Bitcoin ETFs from established financial institutions, a filing from a social media company like Trump Media presents a novel situation. The regulatory path may involve detailed questions about the company’s financial stability, operational capacity to manage a financial product, and how it plans to meet the stringent requirements for listing and trading. The success of this proposal is far from guaranteed and will depend heavily on Truth Social’s ability to demonstrate to the SEC that they can safely and effectively manage such a fund, adhering to all necessary regulations. Potential Benefits: What Could This Spot Bitcoin ETF Offer? If approved, a Truth Social-managed Spot Bitcoin ETF could offer several potential benefits: For Investors: Provides another accessible avenue for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin, potentially with a different fee structure or marketing approach than existing ETFs. It adds to the competitive landscape, which can sometimes lead to better terms for investors. For Truth Social/Trump Media: Could open up a significant new revenue stream through management fees. It would also raise the profile of the company within the financial sector and among the cryptocurrency community. This could attract a different class of investor to Trump Media itself. For the Bitcoin Market: While the impact of a single new ETF filing is less dramatic now that several are already approved, it still represents continued institutional interest and validation for Bitcoin as an asset class. More ETFs mean more potential capital flowing into the market. The unique branding associated with Trump Media could potentially attract a specific segment of investors who align with the company’s values or simply seek diversification among ETF providers. Potential Challenges: The Obstacles Facing the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF Despite the potential benefits, the path to launching a Truth Social Bitcoin ETF is fraught with challenges: Regulatory Hurdles: As mentioned, SEC approval is not automatic. The company must prove it meets all regulatory requirements, which can be demanding for a non-traditional financial entity. Market Competition: The Spot Bitcoin ETF market is already competitive, with established financial giants like BlackRock, Fidelity, and others already operating funds. Truth Social would need to differentiate its offering. Operational Complexity: Managing an ETF requires specialized expertise in portfolio management, custody, compliance, and distribution, which differs significantly from running a social media platform. Association Risk: The strong political association of Trump Media could be a double-edged sword, attracting some investors while potentially alienating others. This could impact the fund’s ability to attract a broad investor base. Execution Risk: Successfully launching and managing a financial product is different from running a media business. There’s a risk that the company may lack the necessary experience or infrastructure. These challenges mean that the filing is just the beginning, and significant work and approvals would be required for this Crypto ETF to become a reality. Comparing the Landscape: How Does This Fit Among Other Bitcoin ETFs? Since January 2024, the US market has seen the launch of several spot Bitcoin ETF s. These funds have accumulated billions in assets under management and trade actively on exchanges. The existing players are primarily large, experienced asset managers. A Truth Social Bitcoin ETF would enter a market that is already establishing its leaders. Its success would likely depend on factors beyond just offering Bitcoin exposure, such as: Management fees compared to competitors. Marketing and distribution strategy. The level of trust investors place in Trump Media as a financial product provider. It remains to be seen how the market would react to an ETF sponsored by a social media company with a distinct political identity, compared to those offered by traditional financial institutions. Market Implications and Reader Insights: What to Watch For The filing itself is a notable event, indicating the continued mainstreaming of Bitcoin and the diverse range of companies looking to participate in the digital asset space. For readers interested in this development, here are some actionable insights: Track the SEC Filing: Public filings are available, and watching for updates or requests for more information from the SEC will be key. Observe Market Reaction: How does the market react to Trump Media stock (if at all) and the general crypto market sentiment following this news? Compare with Existing ETFs: If the ETF is approved, compare its structure, fees, and performance with the already available Spot Bitcoin ETF s before considering investment. Understand the Sponsor: Research Trump Media ‘s business model and financial health, as the success of the ETF could be indirectly linked to the sponsor’s reputation and stability. This filing underscores that the world of finance and technology is constantly evolving, and unexpected players may enter established markets. Conclusion: The Unfolding Story of Truth Social and the Bitcoin ETF Truth Social’s filing for a Spot Bitcoin ETF is a development that highlights the increasing intersection of technology, media, and decentralized finance. While the path to approval is challenging and the market is competitive, it signifies Trump Media ‘s potential ambition to diversify its business and tap into the growing interest in digital assets. Whether this proposed Crypto ETF will ultimately see the light of day remains to be seen, but the filing itself is a compelling part of the ongoing narrative of Bitcoin’s journey into mainstream finance.
