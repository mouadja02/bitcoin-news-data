2025-06-03T23:45:10,"Bitcoin ETF Opportunity: Jacobi Unlocks Access for European Retail Investors","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin ETF Opportunity: Jacobi Unlocks Access for European Retail Investors Exciting news is buzzing across the European investment landscape! A significant development just unfolded that could change how many people on the continent gain exposure to the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Jacobi Asset Management, a well-regarded firm based in the UK, has officially opened the doors of its Bitcoin ETF to a much wider audience – specifically, European retail investors . What Exactly Did Jacobi Asset Management Do? Until now, Jacobi Asset Management’s Bitcoin ETF , which launched on Euronext Amsterdam in 2023, had certain gatekeepers in place. These weren’t arbitrary hurdles, but rather regulatory requirements from the Guernsey Financial Services Commission (GFSC), where the fund is domiciled. The ETF was primarily accessible only to professional investors and often required a significant minimum investment. The big news is that the Guernsey regulator has approved the removal of these restrictions. This means: The ‘professional-only’ rule has been lifted. The minimum investment requirement has been eliminated. This seemingly simple change has a profound impact. It transforms the Jacobi Bitcoin ETF from a product exclusively for institutions and high-net-worth individuals into one that is available to everyday European retail investors looking to gain exposure to digital assets. Why Is This Important for European Retail Investors? For many years, accessing Bitcoin for investment purposes could feel complicated for the average person. It often involved setting up accounts on cryptocurrency exchanges, navigating digital wallets, and worrying about the security of private keys. While direct ownership remains a popular method, it comes with its own set of technical challenges and security risks that can be daunting for newcomers. This move by Jacobi Asset Management provides a potentially simpler, more familiar pathway for European retail investors to Invest in Bitcoin . Here’s why it matters: Accessibility: Investing through an ETF means you can potentially buy and sell shares via traditional brokerage accounts, similar to how you’d trade stocks or other funds. Regulation: The ETF is a regulated financial product. While the underlying asset (Bitcoin) is volatile, the fund structure itself operates within a regulated framework, which can offer a layer of confidence for some investors. Simplicity: You don’t need to worry about managing wallets, understanding blockchain addresses, or securing private keys. The fund manager handles the complexities of holding the underlying Bitcoin. Diversification (within crypto): While this is a single-asset ETF, accessing it via a brokerage account makes it easier to potentially combine with other traditional investments in a diversified portfolio. Essentially, this development democratizes access, bringing a regulated Bitcoin investment option closer to the mainstream for a significant number of potential investors across Europe. Understanding the Jacobi Asset Management Bitcoin ETF Let’s dive a little deeper into the specific product now accessible to European retail investors . The Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin BTR Value Index Fund (ticker: BTR) is listed on Euronext Amsterdam. A key feature is that it is a physically-backed Bitcoin ETF . This means the fund actually holds real Bitcoin as its underlying asset, rather than using derivatives or other synthetic methods. Holding physical Bitcoin is often preferred by investors as it directly tracks the price movements of the asset and avoids potential counterparty risks associated with synthetic structures. The fund is designed to track the performance of the FT Wilshire Bitcoin BTR Value Index. Launched quietly in 2023, it was one of the early movers in offering a physically-backed structure in Europe. Now, with the removal of restrictions, Jacobi Asset Management is positioning it as a key option for those looking to Invest in Bitcoin through a regulated fund vehicle. How Does a Crypto ETF Compare to Direct Ownership When You Invest in Bitcoin? For those new to the space, deciding whether to buy Bitcoin directly or through a fund like a Crypto ETF can be confusing. Both methods allow you to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements, but they differ significantly in execution and implications. Here’s a quick comparison: Feature Investing via a Bitcoin ETF (e.g., Jacobi’s) Direct Bitcoin Ownership Accessibility Buy/sell through traditional brokerage accounts. Requires opening accounts on crypto exchanges, managing wallets. Regulation Fund structure is regulated (e.g., by GFSC in Guernsey). Exchanges and wallets may have varying levels of regulation depending on jurisdiction. Security Fund manager handles custody of Bitcoin. Investors hold ETF shares. Investors are responsible for wallet security, private keys. Risk of hacks, loss. Ease of Use Generally simpler for traditional investors. Familiar process. Requires understanding of blockchain, wallets, transactions. Fees Involves management fees for the fund. Brokerage fees may apply. Transaction fees on exchanges (trading fees), network fees (transferring Bitcoin). Ownership You own shares in a fund that owns Bitcoin. You directly own the Bitcoin asset. Liquidity Shares traded on regulated stock exchange (Euronext Amsterdam). Traded on various crypto exchanges globally. Choosing the right method depends on your comfort level with technology, your understanding of the risks involved in direct custody, and your preference for accessing investments through traditional financial channels versus crypto-native platforms. For many European retail investors , the regulated and accessible nature of a Crypto ETF like Jacobi’s will be a strong draw. What Does This Mean for the Broader Crypto ETF Landscape in Europe? The approval for Jacobi Asset Management to open its Bitcoin ETF to retail investors is a significant step, but it’s part of a larger trend. Europe has generally been ahead of the United States in approving regulated crypto investment products accessible to retail investors, albeit often structured as Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) or Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs), which can have different legal and structural characteristics compared to US-style ETFs (specifically, the spot Bitcoin ETFs recently approved by the SEC). However, the Jacobi product is indeed structured as an ETF under Guernsey regulations, making this move particularly noteworthy for expanding the definition of what’s available to European retail investors . This could potentially pave the way for other similar products or encourage further regulatory clarity across different European jurisdictions regarding direct-holding Bitcoin ETF structures for retail markets. Key Takeaways for Those Looking to Invest in Bitcoin Now If you are a European retail investor considering adding Bitcoin exposure to your portfolio, the availability of the Jacobi Asset Management Bitcoin ETF offers a new, regulated avenue. Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Research: Understand how this specific ETF works, its fees, and its structure (physically-backed). Understand the Risks: While the fund structure is regulated, the price of Bitcoin itself is highly volatile and speculative. You can lose a significant amount, or all, of your investment. Consider Your Portfolio: Think about how an investment in Bitcoin fits into your overall financial goals and risk tolerance. Bitcoin is considered a high-risk asset. Consult a Professional: Speaking with a qualified financial advisor can help you determine if investing in Bitcoin, whether directly or via a Crypto ETF , is appropriate for your personal circumstances. Use a Regulated Broker: Ensure you use a reputable, regulated brokerage platform to access the ETF on Euronext Amsterdam. The expansion of access is positive, but it doesn’t diminish the inherent risks associated with investing in cryptocurrencies. Due diligence remains paramount. Conclusion: A New Era for European Retail Investors and the Bitcoin ETF The decision by Jacobi Asset Management, approved by the Guernsey regulator, to remove restrictions on its Bitcoin ETF marks a pivotal moment for European retail investors . It significantly lowers the barrier to entry for those wishing to Invest in Bitcoin through a regulated, familiar financial product listed on a major European exchange. This move not only provides a new, accessible option for individuals but also signals the continued maturation and integration of digital assets into traditional financial markets. As the landscape of Crypto ETF and similar products evolves, developments like this highlight increasing regulatory comfort and market demand for structured, compliant ways to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies. For Jacobi Asset Management, it represents an opportunity to capture a broader market share and solidify its position in the European digital asset investment space. For investors, it’s a chance to explore Bitcoin exposure with the potential benefits of an ETF structure, provided they approach it with a full understanding of the associated risks.

2025-06-03T23:30:04,"Bitcoin Exchange Netflow Goes Red – 3.6K BTC Daily Outflows Signal Accumulation","Bitcoin is trading at a critical juncture following a volatile week marked by sharp moves and heightened uncertainty. After reaching its all-time high of $112,000, BTC has entered a consolidation phase, hovering around key support and resistance levels. The market now watches closely for signs of the next decisive move—either a breakout to new highs or a deeper correction. Despite the price cooling off, on-chain data suggests underlying strength in the market. According to CryptoQuant, Bitcoin’s average Netflow has shifted into negative territory since March 10, 2025. This metric tracks the balance between BTC deposits to exchanges (typically for selling) and withdrawals (often associated with accumulation). A consistent net negative flow indicates more Bitcoin is being withdrawn than deposited. Currently, about 3,600 BTC are being withdrawn from exchanges daily by retail traders. This sustained trend is widely seen as a bullish signal, reflecting investor confidence and reduced selling pressure. It also implies that many market participants are choosing to hold rather than trade or liquidate at current prices. As Bitcoin stabilizes near critical levels, this persistent withdrawal trend could provide the fuel needed for the next leg up in the ongoing bull cycle. Bitcoin Caught Between Uncertainty And Strength As Netflows Signal Accumulation Bitcoin is currently navigating a phase of high uncertainty as it struggles to establish a clear direction. After peaking near $112,000, the price has entered a choppy consolidation, with bulls looking for a breakout above the all-time high and bears anticipating a sharp correction. The sentiment remains divided, fueled by growing volatility and rising macroeconomic risks. One of the key external factors weighing on the crypto market is the bond market. Rising U.S. Treasury yields are heightening systemic pressure and affecting investor behavior across risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. As yields climb, the cost of capital increases, making speculative investments more sensitive to broader economic signals. Yet amid the uncertainty, on-chain data continues to suggest strong underlying demand for Bitcoin. According to top analyst Axel Adler and insights from CryptoQuant, Bitcoin’s average Netflow has turned negative since March 10, 2025. This means that each day, approximately 3,600 more BTC are being withdrawn from exchanges than deposited, indicating sustained accumulation by retail investors and long-term holders. This trend, marked in green, stands in sharp contrast to the peak Netflow observed in December 2022, when over 12,100 BTC flowed into exchanges, signaling heavy sell pressure. Today’s negative flow points to a healthier market structure, where supply on exchanges steadily declines. While the price may lack short-term direction, this persistent withdrawal trend supports a bullish case over the medium term, as it reflects reduced selling pressure and long-term investor confidence. BTC Price Holds Key Support As Bulls Attempt Recovery Bitcoin is currently trading at $105,338, showing resilience after retesting the $103,600 support level. This area has held firmly despite recent volatility and remains a critical demand zone for bulls to defend. The chart shows BTC bouncing off the 200-period SMA (red line), with a mild uptrend forming on the 4-hour timeframe. Price is now attempting to reclaim the 34 EMA ($105,554) and challenge the 50 and 100 SMAs, both of which converge near $106,900 and act as dynamic resistance. The recent lower high around $109,300 remains a significant barrier for bullish continuation. A decisive breakout above this level would likely signal a fresh attempt at the all-time high near $112,000. On the downside, losing the $103,600 mark would open the door for a deeper correction, potentially dragging BTC back toward the $100,000 psychological level. Volume has been relatively muted during the latest bounce, which suggests the move may lack conviction unless accompanied by a spike in buying pressure. For now, Bitcoin remains range-bound between $103,600 and $109,300, with bulls needing to sustain higher lows and reclaim short-term moving averages to regain momentum. The coming days will be pivotal in determining whether BTC resumes its uptrend or enters a broader consolidation phase.

2025-06-03T23:30:00,"Russian Investigators Begin Seizing Bitcoin from Illegal Crypto Miners","Russian law enforcers have started seizing Bitcoin (BTC) from illegal crypto miners , amid a widening crackdown. In a press release from the Investigative Department of the Investigative Committee (SKR) for the Amur Oblast , the SKR explained that it had confiscated Bitcoin worth around 7 million rubles ($88,570; BTC 0.8414) from an unnamed former electricity company executive. The accused was described as the former head of technological connection services at the Amur branch of the Far Eastern Distribution Company (DRSC). Seizing Bitcoin From Miners – A New Move from Moscow The DRSC is an electrical grid provider. It transports electricity on distribution networks in the Amur Oblast, in Russia’s Far East. The Amur Oblast on a map of Russia. (Source: Stasyan117/Seryo93 [CC BY-SA 4.0]) Investigators say the man used his expert knowledge of his firm’s power distribution systems to siphon electricity from the grid. He used this electricity to power BTC mining rigs, they add. The SKR explained that the man was found “mining cryptocurrency in his own residential building, using his knowledge in the field of technological connection to electrical networks.” Investigators added that the man used his skills to bypass a metering device in 2024. They say he then created an illegal connection to his employee’s electrical grid facilities. Officers estimated that the man used more than 3.5 million rubles ($44,334) of DRSC’s electricity. The SKR is Russia’s main federal investigating authority and anti-corruption agency. The body said it worked with the Federal Security Service to secure the Bitcoin. Police say the same man also took bribes from business owners in the Oblast. The owners allegedly paid the executive to approve electricity-related documentation. Russian officials said more than 700,000 households were without electricity in two Ukrainian regions it partially occupies, following damage to energy infrastructure https://t.co/UpsEEEIcKa — Bloomberg (@business) June 3, 2025 Legal Challenges Seizing Bitcoin and other tokens has proved tricky for investigators in the past, as BTC has no legal status in Russia. However, this could be about to change. In April this year, ministries developed a legal mechanism that proposes granting courts and law enforcers new powers to confiscate crypto in criminal cases . The measure has the support of government policy-makers. If passed, it would allow officials to recognize cryptoassets as intangible property in criminal cases. Investigators appear to have adopted the spirit of this draft law in several high-profile cases. These include the server operator of the Hydra darknet portal, from whom police have seized $8.2 million worth of crypto . Bailiffs have also confiscated BTC 1,032 from the former Russian Investigative Committee investigator Marat Tambiev. A court found the ex-investigator guilty of taking Bitcoin bribes from an international fraud network and jailed him for 16 years .

2025-06-03T23:25:37,"Bitcoin Price Plunges Below $105,000: Urgent Crypto Market Update","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Plunges Below $105,000: Urgent Crypto Market Update The cryptocurrency world is abuzz as the Bitcoin price has recently taken a notable dip, falling below the significant psychological and technical level of $105,000. This movement captures the inherent volatility of the digital asset space and prompts many questions about the immediate future direction of the market. According to real-time market monitoring, BTC price is currently trading around $104,988.51 on major exchanges like the Binance USDT market, confirming the breach of this key threshold. Understanding the Recent Bitcoin Price Movement A fall below a round number like $105,000 is more than just a number change; it can trigger algorithmic trading strategies and influence market sentiment. For many traders and investors, round numbers act as psychological support or resistance levels. When breached, they can accelerate price movements in that direction. This particular Bitcoin drop has put market participants on edge, wondering if this is a temporary setback or the start of a deeper correction. Several factors could be contributing to this recent price action. While pinpointing a single cause is often difficult in a complex system like the crypto market, a combination of global macroeconomic factors, shifts in investor sentiment, technical trading signals, and potentially large whale movements could be at play. Let’s break down some potential drivers: Macroeconomic Headwinds: Concerns about inflation, interest rate hikes by central banks, and geopolitical tensions can lead investors to reduce exposure to riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies. Market Sentiment: News cycles, regulatory FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt), or even viral social media trends can quickly shift market sentiment from bullish to bearish. Technical Indicators: Breaking below key moving averages or support levels identified through technical analysis can trigger sell orders. The $105,000 level may have been one such point. Whale Activity: Large holders of Bitcoin (whales) can significantly impact price with large buy or sell orders, sometimes initiating cascading liquidations in the derivatives market. Analyzing these factors helps provide context for the current BTC price behavior, but predicting short-term movements remains challenging. Navigating the Current Crypto Market Volatility Volatility is a defining characteristic of the crypto market . While exciting during upward trends, it can be daunting during declines. A significant Bitcoin drop often has ripple effects across the entire ecosystem. Altcoins, which are cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin, often correlate with BTC’s price movements. When Bitcoin falls, many altcoins tend to fall harder, exhibiting higher beta relative to BTC. Understanding this correlation is crucial for investors holding diversified crypto portfolios. The current market condition requires a calm and strategic approach rather than impulsive decisions based on fear. Market cycles involve periods of accumulation, markup, distribution, and markdown. Price dips, while painful in the short term, are a normal part of these cycles and can even present opportunities for those with a long-term perspective. The reaction of the broader crypto market to this specific Bitcoin drop will be closely watched. Will altcoins follow suit dramatically, or will some show resilience? This often depends on the specific narrative surrounding individual projects and their fundamental strength, though short-term price action is heavily influenced by overall market sentiment dictated by Bitcoin. Analyzing the Bitcoin Drop : Technical and Fundamental Factors From a technical analysis standpoint, the $105,000 level likely served as a point of interest for many traders. Prior to the breach, it may have acted as support, a price level where buying interest was expected to outweigh selling pressure. A confirmed break below support is often seen as a bearish signal, potentially opening the door for further declines to the next identified support levels. Without getting into overly complex charts, let’s consider what support and resistance mean in simple terms: Support: A price level where a downtrend is expected to pause due to a concentration of demand. Resistance: A price level where an uptrend is expected to pause due to a concentration of supply. When a support level is broken, it can sometimes turn into a resistance level on subsequent price bounces. The market will now be watching to see if $105,000 acts as resistance if the price attempts to recover. Other key technical levels below $105,000 would be identified based on historical price action, Fibonacci retracements, or moving averages. Fundamentally, the recent Bitcoin news hasn’t highlighted any single, catastrophic event that would definitively cause this drop. This suggests the movement is likely more influenced by broader market dynamics, technical triggers, and sentiment rather than a specific negative news story directly related to Bitcoin’s underlying technology or adoption. Factors like institutional investment trends, regulatory clarity (or lack thereof), and development updates within the Bitcoin network contribute to the fundamental picture, but their impact is often longer-term. What This Bitcoin News Means for Investors For investors navigating this turbulent period, understanding the implications of this Bitcoin drop is paramount. It’s easy to get caught up in the fear and panic that can accompany significant price declines. However, approaching the situation with a clear strategy is essential. Here are some key considerations: Challenges Faced by Investors: Emotional Stress: Watching portfolio values decrease can be highly stressful and lead to irrational decisions. Potential Losses: Short-term traders or those with high leverage can face significant losses or liquidations. Uncertainty: Not knowing how much further the price might fall creates anxiety. Potential Benefits (Opportunities) During a Dip: Buying Opportunity: For long-term investors, a price drop can represent an opportunity to acquire Bitcoin at a lower price point. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Continuing to invest a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price, can lower the average cost per Bitcoin over time. Rebalancing Portfolios: A dip can be a chance to re-evaluate and potentially rebalance your cryptocurrency holdings. Actionable Insights for Investors: Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Understand how much volatility you can comfortably handle without making panic decisions. Have a Plan: Decide beforehand under what conditions you might buy more, sell, or hold. Stick to your plan. Avoid Leverage (Unless You’re an Experienced Trader): High leverage amplifies both gains and losses, making dips significantly more dangerous. Focus on the Long Term: Bitcoin’s history is marked by significant volatility followed by new all-time highs. Consider your investment horizon. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t rely solely on social media hype or fear. Understand the fundamentals of Bitcoin and the broader market. Secure Your Assets: Ensure your Bitcoin is stored securely, preferably in a hardware wallet, especially during volatile times when exchange security might be tested by high volume. This Bitcoin news serves as a reminder that the path of cryptocurrency investment is rarely a straight line upwards. Patience and a well-thought-out strategy are invaluable assets. Is This Just a Dip or a Trend Reversal? This is the question on everyone’s mind. Determining whether the recent Bitcoin drop is a temporary correction within a larger uptrend or the beginning of a sustained downtrend is challenging. Market analysis involves looking at multiple indicators and potential future events. A ‘dip’ implies a relatively short-lived price decline followed by a recovery and continuation of the previous trend. A ‘trend reversal’ suggests a more significant shift in market direction, potentially leading to a prolonged bear market. Several factors could influence which scenario plays out: Volume: High selling volume during the drop could indicate strong conviction from sellers, suggesting a potential reversal. Low volume might suggest less conviction and a higher chance of a bounce. Speed of Recovery: A quick bounce back above key levels like $105,000 would support the ‘dip’ narrative. External Factors: Major positive or negative news (regulatory clarity, institutional adoption milestones, or conversely, significant bans or hacks) could strongly influence the direction. Overall Market Conditions: The performance of traditional markets and the global economic outlook will continue to play a significant role. Right now, the market is in a state of uncertainty. Traders will be watching key support levels below $105,000, while long-term investors might view this as an opportunity. Only time will tell if this Bitcoin news marks a temporary pause or a more significant shift. Conclusion: Staying Informed in the Dynamic Crypto Market The recent fall of Bitcoin price below $105,000 is a stark reminder of the dynamic nature of the crypto market . While the specific reasons for this particular Bitcoin drop are likely multifaceted, involving technical breaches, sentiment shifts, and macroeconomic influences, the event underscores the importance of preparedness for volatility. For investors, this period presents both challenges in managing potential losses and opportunities for strategic accumulation. Staying informed through reliable Bitcoin news sources, maintaining a disciplined investment approach, and focusing on long-term goals are crucial for navigating these market fluctuations successfully. Whether this dip leads to further declines or proves to be a temporary setback, the principles of risk management and informed decision-making remain paramount in the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency.

2025-06-03T23:15:29,"Missed Ethereum’s Early Days? Grab the Best Crypto to Buy This Month with 4300% ROI Upside!","Many remember Ethereum’s 2015 launch when early backers turned modest purchases into life-changing wealth. Missing out on ETH’s meteoric rise left many asking: “What if?” Another chance for generational wealth is here as the best crypto to buy this month: the Qubetics ($TICS) presale. This project addresses the challenges Ethereum once aimed to fix—scalability, security, and connectivity—but now, it’s backed by modern solutions and an active community. Qubetics is at the forefront of blockchain’s future, promising real-life utility and secure, smooth cross-border payments. Early adopters see it as one of the best cryptos to buy this month. Let’s break down what makes Qubetics’ interoperability provide solutions and why it’s creating much hype in the crypto presale space as the best crypto to buy this month. Qubetics ($TICS): The Second Chance You’ve Been Waiting For Qubetics ($TICS) isn’t just another crypto project—it’s redefining how blockchains connect and share data. Its standout feature? Interoperability. Unlike most networks that operate in silos, Qubetics builds a Web3-aggregated chain, seamlessly linking blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This feature removes barriers to data sharing and cross-chain transfers, unlocking possibilities for everyone. This means faster, cost-effective cross-border payments for small businesses that sidestep the usual delays and high fees. A local shop can now accept payments from buyers using any blockchain token, while freelancers in one country can instantly get paid in their preferred currency from clients overseas. No more lost time waiting for third-party payment processors or struggling with currency conversions—Qubetics’ interoperability smooths it all out. Even developers see fresh opportunities. Building apps that run on any blockchain without complex bridges saves time and money. They can reach broader markets and serve users who prefer different networks, all while keeping costs low and security high. Qubetics’ approach also helps enterprises. Big brands in global supply chains can track goods in real-time and settle payments instantly across different currencies—no more waiting for separate networks to catch up. Artists and creators get to mint and sell NFTs, knowing they can accept payments from fans using any crypto network they like. The real-world applications of Qubetics’ interoperability are clear from small business owners to large enterprises. It’s a versatile solution that opens doors, helping people move money, share data, and build new blockchain-based tools without barriers. This unique feature places Qubetics firmly among the best cryptos to buy this month, catching the eye of those who missed earlier waves of opportunity. Qubetics Crypto Presale: A Rare Entry Point for Community Members Qubetics’ crypto presale is in its 37th stage, offering $TICS at just $0.3370 per token. So far, more than 27,400 backers have scooped up over 515 million tokens, raising over $17.7 million. This growing community sees the potential, especially with the price set to rise another 10% in the next stage this weekend. Those who joined at just $0.01 in stage 1 already see a 3270% gain. But the window isn’t closed yet. Current participants are locking in a 196.65% return if $TICS hits $1 after the presale—and potentially a massive 4349.76% return when it reaches $15 after the mainnet launch. The momentum is building fast, making Qubetics one of the best cryptos to buy this month while the crypto presale remains active. How Much Can $5,000 Get You in Qubetics Right Now? At the current presale price of $0.3370, a $5,000 purchase secures about 14,850 $TICS tokens. When $TICS reaches $1 after the presale, those tokens could be worth $14,850—a tidy 196.65% return. But it doesn’t stop there. If Qubetics surges to $5, the same tokens become $74,250. If it reaches $10 or $15, as analysts predict, the haul jumps to $148,500 and $222,750, respectively. Those who got in early already watch their tokens’ worth climb daily. And for those on the sidelines, there’s still a chance to join the presale before the next price jump this weekend. Community excitement is real—every new stage sees more backers eager to claim their piece of this future-ready blockchain. Ethereum (ETH): A Missed Chance That Shaped the Market Launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin and a small team of blockchain pioneers, Ethereum quickly became a blueprint for what blockchain technology could achieve. With its smart contract capabilities, Ethereum fueled countless decentralized applications and set the stage for the DeFi boom. Backers who joined at just $0.75 per ETH watched it soar past $4,800 in 2021, making millionaires out of early supporters. Despite its massive growth, many missed out on those early days. ETH’s slow transaction speeds and high gas fees also left users frustrated. While it’s still a major force and one of the best cryptos to buy this month for long-term holders, Ethereum’s early stage is long gone. Those who felt left out now have their eyes on new projects like Qubetics ($TICS) that combine Ethereum’s vision with modern solutions for cross-chain interaction and real-world impact. Conclusion Ethereum’s early stage is history—a story that turned early buyers into legends. But missing that doesn’t mean missing out altogether. Qubetics ($TICS) shows why it’s one of the best cryptos to buy this month . With its unique interoperability, it’s creating real connections across blockchains and fixing real-world problems. As thousands join the presale and credible updates flow in, early buyers see a future where $TICS becomes a pillar of digital finance. This isn’t a generic pitch—it’s a real chance to watch something special take shape. Take a closer look, see the excitement, and don’t let this be another “what if” moment.

2025-06-03T23:05:52,"Revolut Crypto Derivatives: Job Posting Hints at Ambitious Expansion","BitcoinWorld Revolut Crypto Derivatives: Job Posting Hints at Ambitious Expansion Are you a keen observer of the fintech world and the ever-evolving cryptocurrency landscape? If so, a recent development regarding financial super app Revolut likely caught your eye. A strategic Revolut job posting has sparked considerable discussion, strongly suggesting the company is exploring a significant move into the complex and high-stakes world of Revolut crypto derivatives . What Does the Revolut Job Posting Tell Us? The speculation began with a listing for a “General Manager (Crypto Derivatives)” role. This isn’t just any job posting; it’s a senior position designed to lead a potentially new business line. The fact that Revolut is seeking someone to manage a dedicated crypto derivatives operation is a strong indicator that this is more than just a casual interest. The listed locations – London, Barcelona, and Dubai – are also telling, pointing towards a global or multi-regional strategy for this potential new venture. While Revolut itself has not yet issued an official statement confirming these plans, a job posting of this nature, especially for a General Manager role, typically signifies that a company is seriously considering, if not actively preparing for, a strategic initiative. It requires significant planning, regulatory considerations, and resource allocation to even reach the point of hiring for such a leadership position. Understanding the Crypto Derivatives Market Before diving deeper into Revolut’s potential move, let’s briefly touch upon what crypto derivatives market entails. Unlike buying and selling cryptocurrencies directly (the spot market), derivatives are financial contracts whose value is derived from an underlying asset, in this case, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Common types of crypto derivatives include: Futures Contracts: An agreement to buy or sell a cryptocurrency at a specific price on a future date. Options Contracts: Give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a cryptocurrency at a specific price (strike price) before or on a certain date. Perpetual Swaps: Similar to futures but without an expiry date, making them popular for continuous trading and often using funding rates to peg their price to the spot market. The crypto derivatives market is significantly larger in trading volume than the spot market. It allows traders to speculate on price movements (both up and down) without owning the underlying asset, and often involves leverage, which can amplify both profits and losses. Why Would Revolut Enter This Market? Revolut has established itself as a major player in the fintech crypto space, offering users easy access to buying, selling, and holding various cryptocurrencies alongside traditional financial services. Expanding into derivatives seems like a natural, albeit ambitious, progression. Several factors could be driving this potential move: Revenue Diversification: Derivatives trading generates significant fees and can become a major revenue stream. Meeting User Demand: As crypto adoption grows, so does the sophistication of users. Many experienced traders look for derivative products. Competitive Pressure: Many major crypto exchanges already offer derivatives trading. To remain competitive and a comprehensive financial super app, Revolut may feel the need to offer a wider range of crypto products. Leveraging Existing Infrastructure: Revolut already has a large user base, a trading platform, and compliance infrastructure that could potentially be adapted for derivatives. What are the Potential Benefits for Revolut Users? For existing Revolut users interested in crypto, the introduction of derivatives could open up new avenues for trading crypto futures and other complex instruments. Benefits might include: Convenience: Accessing both spot crypto and derivatives within a single, familiar Revolut app. New Trading Strategies: Ability to implement strategies like hedging, arbitrage, and leveraged trading. Potential for Higher Returns: Leverage can magnify profits, though it also significantly increases risk. However, it’s crucial to remember that derivatives are complex and carry high risks, especially with leverage. What Challenges Might Revolut Face? Entering the crypto derivatives market is not without significant hurdles. Revolut would need to navigate: Regulatory Complexity: Derivatives are heavily regulated in many jurisdictions. Obtaining licenses and complying with varying regulations across different countries (like the UK, EU, and UAE, suggested by the job locations) will be a major challenge. Risk Management: Managing the risks associated with highly volatile assets and leveraged trading requires robust systems and expertise. Competition: The crypto derivatives space is dominated by established players with deep liquidity and advanced trading platforms. User Education: Derivatives are not suitable for all investors. Revolut would need to implement strong educational resources and risk warnings to protect users. Technical Infrastructure: Building and maintaining a reliable, low-latency trading engine capable of handling high volumes of derivatives trades is a significant technical undertaking. How Does This Position Revolut in the Fintech Crypto Space? This potential move would solidify Revolut’s position as a leader in the fintech crypto sector, bridging the gap between traditional finance apps and dedicated crypto exchanges. By offering more sophisticated trading products, Revolut could attract a new segment of more active and experienced crypto traders, while potentially retaining existing users who want to explore more advanced strategies. It signals an ambition to move beyond simple buy-and-hold crypto services and compete directly with major crypto trading platforms on a global scale. This could accelerate the convergence of traditional finance and crypto services within popular consumer-facing apps. What Are the Actionable Insights for Investors and Traders? For those watching Revolut and the crypto market, this development offers a few key takeaways: Keep an Eye on Official Announcements: While the job posting is a strong hint, wait for official confirmation from Revolut regarding their plans, timelines, and specific product offerings. Understand the Risks: If Revolut does launch derivatives, educate yourself thoroughly on how they work, especially leverage, before engaging in trading crypto futures or options. Derivatives can lead to rapid and substantial losses. Compare Offerings: If you are interested in derivatives, compare Revolut’s potential offering (when announced) with existing platforms on factors like fees, available instruments, leverage options, and regulatory compliance. Monitor Regulatory Developments: The regulatory landscape for crypto derivatives is constantly changing. Stay informed about regulations in your region that might affect access to or the structure of these products. Conclusion: A Bold Step for Revolut? The Revolut job posting for a General Manager of Crypto Derivatives is far more than just a standard hiring notice; it’s a strong signal of the fintech giant’s potential strategic direction. Entering the crypto derivatives market represents a bold step that could significantly expand Revolut’s product suite and revenue streams, positioning it more directly against major global crypto exchanges. While the potential benefits for users seeking advanced trading crypto futures are clear, the challenges related to regulation, risk management, and intense competition are substantial. As Revolut continues to build out its team and strategy, the financial world will be watching closely to see if this fintech leader successfully navigates the complexities of the derivatives space and truly unlocks this next level of crypto trading for its millions of users.

2025-06-03T23:00:36,"BlockDAG’s $0.0018 Entry Closes on June 13! Dogecoin Faces Breakdown & Chainlink Turns Bullish","Price action remains uncertain for Dogecoin (DOGE), which continues hovering between $0.187 and $0.19. This range has become a critical zone for bulls and bears, as DOGE attempts to recover from recent weakness. Meanwhile, Chainlink (LINK) is showing early signs of a rebound, following a sharp decline caused by an oracle malfunction that led to a $532K liquidation. These two assets are gaining attention for different reasons: Dogecoin for its fragile price levels and Chainlink for its potential recovery. Still, neither offers the kind of entry opportunity currently found with BlockDAG (BDAG) . With BDAG still priced at $0.0018 and more than 21.8 billion coins already acquired, only a handful of stages remain. The upcoming June 13 GO LIVE reveal could mark the end of this rare sub-cent access. For those scanning the top trending crypto picks, this may be the last straightforward chance for early entry. BlockDAG: Sub-Cent Phase Nearing Its End BlockDAG is reaching a crucial phase in its presale journey. Priced at $0.0018, the coin has now surpassed 21.8 billion in total sales, and just 17 stages are left. Demand continues to climb, with each new stage filling up faster than the last. The upcoming GO LIVE reveal on June 13 is increasing urgency. This current price point reflects a 2520% increase from the launch value of $0.0001. With over $282 million already raised and growing traction across its tools, such as the X1 mining app, interest remains strong. Completed security audits by Certik and Halborn support the technical foundation, and developer-ready smart contract deployment is already functional. Its blend of DAG architecture and Proof of Work enables better scalability and fast transaction throughput while keeping fees minimal. Compatibility with Ethereum and the user-friendly no-code builder also enhances accessibility. With more than 1 million users of the X1 app, BDAG is now being talked about as one of the top trending crypto picks. For watchers looking to act before the next surge, BDAG’s price zone at $0.0018 stands out. As the GO LIVE reveal draws closer, failing to take part now could mean missing a major early-phase opportunity. Dogecoin (DOGE) Chart Battles $0.187 Support Zone Dogecoin’s current movement is stuck in a narrow zone between $0.187 and $0.190, according to analysts. This is seen as a make-or-break level. A rebound from here could lift DOGE toward the $0.215 mark, but if it falls below $0.187, analysts say it may lead to selling pressure. Although it dipped under $0.20, top analysts like Lingrid and Stanley believe the coin is still maintaining a higher low along its upward trendline. For now, the focus is on whether DOGE can reclaim $0.195 with strong volume. That would be the first sign of a trend reversal. If Bitcoin faces another pullback, though, it could apply more downside pressure. Whether Dogecoin rebounds or breaks lower depends on how it performs in the coming sessions. Chainlink (LINK) Technicals Suggest Possible Rebound A recent oracle malfunction triggered a steep drop in LINK’s price, with 7.77% shaved off, pushing it down to roughly $14.54 and resulting in $532K in liquidations. Yet analysts believe there’s now a potential for a short squeeze, especially if it maintains support above $14 and pushes back to $15. If LINK clears $15, it may quickly rise to $16 or even $17.4. However, slipping below $13.86 could increase downside risk. On-chain data indicates long-term holders have stayed put, and the project continues to see integration across DeFi applications. With nearly $599 million in volume and a market cap near $9.56 billion, the fundamentals are still solid. Any sustained move above $16 could bring a shift in momentum, potentially opening the path toward $19.8. Final Thoughts! Dogecoin’s chart is teetering near its critical support zone at $0.187, and any slip could trigger a deeper correction. Chainlink, on the other hand, is flashing signs of a technical bounce if it reclaims $15. While both are being monitored closely, they don’t offer the current kind of low entry that BlockDAG still does. With BDAG available at $0.0018, more than 21.8 billion coins already sold, and limited stages remaining, this window won’t stay open long. The June 13 GO LIVE reveal might signal the final moment for sub-cent access. Those scanning the top trending crypto picks may want to act before it’s too late.

2025-06-03T23:00:02,"Ethereum Reclaims Pivotal Level – Key Resistance Around $2,650","Ethereum pushed above the $2,600 mark yesterday, signaling renewed momentum, but the rally lost steam as broader market uncertainty capped further gains. Despite this, ETH remains resilient, holding above critical demand levels that have supported its recent uptrend. Investors and analysts alike are watching closely, as Ethereum’s strength could be the catalyst that kicks off the long-anticipated altseason. Related Reading: Ethereum Supply On Exchanges Hits 7-Year Low – Breakout Loading? The broader crypto market remains in a cautious state due to macroeconomic volatility and shifting investor sentiment, but Ethereum’s ability to stay above $2,500 has helped maintain bullish conviction. Many are now eyeing the $2,650 level, which has historically acted as a barrier for upward moves. Top analyst Daan shared a technical analysis noting that ETH is currently pushing into a key resistance area around $2,650. If Ethereum can flip this zone into support, it could open the door for a more aggressive breakout and broader altcoin rally. While risks remain, the overall setup is increasingly favorable for Ethereum bulls, especially if Bitcoin stabilizes and global conditions don’t deteriorate further. The coming days may be pivotal in determining whether ETH can overcome this resistance and lead the next phase of the market cycle. Ethereum Faces Make-Or-Break Level As Speculation Builds Ethereum is once again trading at a pivotal level as the market eyes a potential breakout that could ignite an altseason. After months of underperformance marked by heavy selling pressure and limited upside, ETH has begun to show renewed strength. Bulls have defended key demand zones, and the recent consolidation around the $2,500–$2,600 range is now viewed as a launchpad for higher prices. Despite persistent global tensions, particularly US-China trade friction and rising Treasury yields, ETH has shown signs of resilience. Investors remain optimistic that Ethereum could soon outperform, especially as Bitcoin dominance shows signs of peaking. The long-anticipated shift in capital from BTC into altcoins may be near, and Ethereum is positioned to lead the charge. Daan highlighted Ethereum’s 4-hour chart, pointing to resistance around the $2,650 level as a crucial short-term hurdle. The chart reveals ETH grinding higher but unable, so far, to reclaim the level decisively. Should Ethereum successfully flip $2,650 into support, it would open the path toward $2,700 and potentially spark a bullish continuation. For now, bulls remain in control, but Ethereum needs to break through overhead supply to confirm the start of a new leg up. A decisive move above $2,700 could serve as the catalyst for both ETH and the broader altcoin market, marking a major sentiment shift across the crypto landscape. Related Reading: Ethereum Poised For A 5-Figure Breakout – Volatility Is Shaking ‘Weak Hands’ ETH Price Analysis: Rebound Gains Traction Ethereum is currently trading at $2,604 on the 4-hour chart after rebounding from a local low near $2,500. This recovery places ETH back above its 34-period EMA ($2,566) and all major short-term SMAs (50, 100, and 200), which suggests short-term bullish momentum is returning. However, price is still facing heavy supply just below the $2,650 resistance area, a level that has repeatedly rejected upward moves throughout the past month. The chart shows a clear horizontal range forming between approximately $2,500 and $2,700, with ETH unable to break either end decisively. Volume has remained relatively stable, indicating no strong conviction from bulls or bears yet. The recent bounce, though, marks a higher low, which could hint at a potential trend shift if followed by a higher high. Related Reading: Solana Reclaims Key Support After Sweeping Lows – Early Signs Of Reversal? As ETH approaches the upper bound of this range again, traders should monitor for a breakout above $2,650, which would confirm bullish continuation. Failing to clear this resistance could lead to another rejection back to $2,500 or the 200 SMA near $2,380. For now, Ethereum remains in consolidation mode, but price action is tilting slightly in favor of the bulls as long as support holds.

2025-06-03T22:56:59,"Bitcoin: Strategic 10.5K BTC Transfer by Tether Fuels SoftBank’s Investment","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: Strategic 10.5K BTC Transfer by Tether Fuels SoftBank’s Investment A significant move is underway in the world of cryptocurrency, highlighting growing institutional interest and strategic partnerships. Tether, the company behind the popular USDT stablecoin, is making headlines with a substantial Bitcoin transfer. This action is directly linked to a major Crypto Investment by global tech giant SoftBank, signaling confidence in the digital asset space and specific firms within it. What’s Happening with This Significant Bitcoin Transfer? Tether Group CEO Paolo Ardoino recently announced via X that the company is transferring 10,500 Bitcoin (BTC) to a specific wallet address. This isn’t just a routine transaction; it’s part of a larger, strategic financial maneuver. The transfer is designated as pre-funding for SoftBank’s previously announced investment in the Bitcoin investment firm, Twenty One Capital (XXI). Let’s break down the key elements: Amount: 10,500 BTC (a considerable sum given current market values). Sender: Tether Group. Recipient: A wallet address starting with bc1qpz, linked to the investment structure. Purpose: Pre-funding SoftBank’s investment in Twenty One Capital . This move underscores the interconnectedness of major players in the crypto and traditional finance sectors. Understanding the Key Players: Tether, SoftBank, and Twenty One Capital This transaction involves several prominent entities, each playing a crucial role in the evolving landscape of finance and technology. Tether: Best known for USDT, the largest stablecoin by market capitalization. Tether plays a vital role in providing liquidity and stability within the crypto ecosystem. Their involvement in this Crypto Investment highlights their expanding influence beyond stablecoin issuance into strategic asset management and partnerships. SoftBank: A massive Japanese multinational conglomerate holding company with significant investments in technology, telecommunications, and finance globally. SoftBank’s decision to invest in a Bitcoin -focused firm like Twenty One Capital is a strong indicator of increasing institutional adoption and belief in the long-term value of digital assets. Twenty One Capital (XXI): A firm specializing in Bitcoin investments. While perhaps less widely known than SoftBank or Tether, attracting investment from such major players positions XXI for significant growth and prominence in the Bitcoin investment space. The investment round in Twenty One Capital also includes other notable participants like Bitfinex (a major cryptocurrency exchange closely associated with Tether) and Cantor Fitzgerald (a global financial services firm). This consortium of investors brings together diverse expertise from crypto infrastructure, traditional finance, and global investment, creating a powerful synergy for XXI. Why is SoftBank Investing in Twenty One Capital? SoftBank’s investment in Twenty One Capital , facilitated by this large Bitcoin transfer from Tether, speaks volumes about the maturation of the crypto market. Traditional finance giants are no longer just observing; they are actively participating and investing in firms that specialize in digital assets like Bitcoin . Reasons for such an investment often include: Exposure to Bitcoin: Gaining indirect or direct exposure to the performance of Bitcoin through a specialized fund or firm. Growth Potential: Believing in the significant growth potential of the digital asset market and firms positioned to capitalize on it. Diversification: Adding digital assets to a diversified investment portfolio. Strategic Partnerships: Building relationships with key players in the crypto space like Tether and Bitfinex. The fact that Tether is handling the pre-funding in Bitcoin itself is particularly interesting. It suggests that the investment structure involves the direct use of BTC as an asset, rather than solely fiat currency, further embedding digital assets into the investment mechanism. Implications of This Crypto Investment This move has several potential implications for the market and the involved parties: Validation for Twenty One Capital: Receiving investment from SoftBank, Tether, Bitfinex, and Cantor Fitzgerald provides significant validation and credibility for XXI. Increased Institutional Confidence: A major player like SoftBank making a direct investment in a Bitcoin firm via a structured deal involving Tether can boost confidence among other institutional investors considering entering the space. Potential Market Impact: While the transfer itself is internal to the investment structure, the news of SoftBank’s investment and Tether’s role could positively influence market sentiment towards Bitcoin and related investment vehicles. Evolution of Tether’s Role: Tether’s participation in facilitating such investments highlights its growing role as a key financial entity within the broader digital asset ecosystem, extending beyond stablecoin operations. This transaction is more than just a large transfer of Bitcoin ; it’s a clear signal of increasing convergence between traditional finance and the crypto world, with major players like SoftBank and Tether leading the charge in facilitating significant Crypto Investment . What Does This Mean for the Future? The collaboration between SoftBank, Tether , Bitfinex, Cantor Fitzgerald, and Twenty One Capital points towards a future where large-scale institutional participation in Bitcoin and other digital assets becomes increasingly common. As more traditional finance firms and tech giants allocate capital to this sector, it could lead to greater market stability, liquidity, and mainstream acceptance. This specific instance provides a concrete example of how complex, multi-party investments involving digital assets are being structured and executed. It demonstrates confidence not only in Bitcoin as an asset class but also in the infrastructure and firms operating within the crypto ecosystem. While challenges remain, such as regulatory clarity and market volatility, strategic investments like this one from SoftBank, facilitated by Tether’s Bitcoin transfer to Twenty One Capital , lay the groundwork for broader adoption and integration of digital assets into the global financial system. In conclusion, Tether’s transfer of 10,500 Bitcoin is a pivotal step in executing SoftBank’s strategic investment in Twenty One Capital . This collaboration between titans of tech, finance, and crypto underscores the growing significance of Bitcoin and the digital asset space in global investment strategies, marking a notable moment in the ongoing institutional embrace of crypto.

The current market cap sits at $225 billion, but firms like Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and others are watching the space closely as new rules come into play and more institutions enter the scene. Devin Ryan, head of financial technology research at Citizens JMP, said they expect stablecoins to open up almost $100 billion in annual revenue for issuers. “Even as interest rates normalize off our $3 trillion estimate, we project a nearly $100 billion revenue opportunity for issuers, which for some will represent incremental fees while for others will be necessary to offset lower transaction fees,” he wrote . Banks, tech firms, and Congress push stablecoin adoption Devin explained that major players from different industries are now entering what he called a post-regulatory ‘land grab’, now that the path is clearer under the Trump administration. The White House has been rolling back Biden-era crypto policies, and Ryan believes that’s fueling new interest from traditional finance. Congress is also expected to pass the GENIUS Act — a bill focused on stablecoin legislation — as early as August 2025. At the same time, new regulatory systems are popping up around the world. Europe’s MiCA law is already active, while Singapore and others are building their own frameworks. The hope is that clearer rules will drive up global adoption and encourage more institutional use of stablecoins outside just trading. Citigroup’s Alex Saunders added more fuel to the forecast in a note on May 30, saying stablecoins could reach between $1.6 trillion and $3.7 trillion by 2030. Alex said the coins are being used as more than just bridge tokens in crypto. “There’s a case to be made for stablecoins as an alternative store of value or a hedge against inflation and political volatility,” Alex wrote. That’s especially true in countries facing currency issues or economic instability. Stablecoins link remittances, US debt demand, and digital payments Devin also said that stablecoins are now useful in everyday finance, things like remittances, business payments, and e-commerce. He pointed out their growing role in tokenized financial markets and said they offer a practical store of value in economies hit by inflation. On top of that, they might boost US debt demand. “Critically for the United States … we estimate the US could see a multi-trillion structural bid for its debt — supporting liquidity and reinforcing monetary leadership,” Devin wrote. Treasury Bills are already used to back many stablecoins, so more demand for these tokens means more demand for US bonds. Alex echoed that point, saying, “The US dollar’s reserve currency status is likely to be reflected in, rather than driven by, relative currency stablecoin issuance.” Both analysts agree that the growth of stablecoins could help keep the dollar strong globally. Meanwhile, the broader crypto market is also showing signs of strength, with Bitcoin staying well above $105,000 as of press time. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones jumped over 200 points — a 0.5% gain — marking four straight days in the green. The S&P 500 went up by 0.6%, and the Nasdaq rose by 0.8%, helped by tech stocks. Nvidia rose by nearly 3%, briefly pushing past Microsoft to become the world’s most valuable public company, yet again. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

According to a recent SEC filing, the Truth Social seeks to list and trade shares of the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF on the NYSE Arca Exchange. The Truth Social Bitcoin ETF will be managed by Foris DAX Trust Company, LLC, whereby investors will only be allowed cash settlement. The filing of the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF follows a recent move by the Trump Media and Technology Group to raise $2.5B to implement a Bitcoin treasury management plan. Truth Social Affirms High Bitcoin Demand from Institutional Investors The filing of the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF aligns with the cryptocurrency agenda of the U.S. President Donald Trump. Furthermore, the Trump Organization and the Official Trump Meme ($TRUMP) have played a crucial role in the mainstream adoption of digital assets. The overall demand for Bitcoin by institutional investors as a hedge against inflation and macroeconomic uncertainty remains high. According to market data analysis from BitcoinTreasuries , 223 entities now hold more than 3.39 million BTCs as part of their treasury management strategy. Is BTC Price Ready to Moon? As Coinpedia reported , the rising demand for Bitcoin from institutional investors has helped increase bullish sentiment. The recent weekly rebound from a crucial support/resistance level around $104k is a clear indication that BTC price is preparing for a fresh rally towards a new all-time high.

2025-06-03T22:40:06,"Jacobi BCOIN ETF could become the first Bitcoin ETF in Europe","Assets management firm Jacobi will now offer its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) to European retail investors. The move follows regulatory approval by the Guernsey Financial Service Commission. According to an announcement from the firm, the Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF (BCOIN) , launched in 2023 on Euronext Amsterdam, will no longer be restricted to professional and institutional investors, with regulators now deeming it safe enough for retail. It said: “Retail investors, subject to the rules of their respective national regulators, can now access the Jacobi Bitcoin ETF via regulated brokerage and investment platforms.” The firm stated that this will increase accessibility to the product, which is in line with its mission to provide secure exposure to digital assets. With nearly two years of regulatory oversight as an institutional-grade product, removing the barriers is expected to boost its appeal. Meanwhile, the announcement noted that removing the restrictions on who can invest and the minimum investment amount is due to Bitcoin’s evolution over the past few years, making the once-niche cryptocurrency a mainstream asset. Jacobi BCOIN ETF could become the first Bitcoin ETF in Europe Interestingly, the Jacobi-issued BCOIN could become the first Bitcoin ETF to trade in Europe. While several issuers, including CoinShares and Bitwise, have issued physical Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) , there is no ETF for crypto assets. This is due to the Undertaking for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) framework, which does not allow funds with only one component. Despite the difference in nomenclature and framework, crypto ETPs in Europe are similar to the spot crypto ETFs in the US. CoinShares physical Bitcoin ETP and Bitwise Bitcoin ETP dominate the market with €1.499 billion and €1.198 billion, respectively. With BCOIN entering the scene, it hopes to attract investors’ interest in a sector with over 100 crypto ETP products. This could prove challenging given that even BlackRock IBIT ETP has only around €260 million. Presently, Jacobi BCOIN has around $1.9 million in assets under management. Meanwhile, Jacobi CEO Peter Lane praised Gurnsey’s approach to regulating the digital assets sector while adding that the firm is excited to make the Bitcoin ETF accessible in eligible countries. He said: “We applaud Guernsey as an innovative jurisdiction who have embraced the evolution of digital assets and look forward to bringing more innovative, digital asset products to market with robust regulatory oversight.” To secure approval, the UK-based asset manager worked with other firms, including Sigma Asset Management, Collas Crill, and Midshore Consulting. Guernsey is a dependency of the United Kingdom. Experts say BlackRock IBIT could finish 2025 with over 1 million BTC by 2026 ending While Jacobi is looking to attract investors to BCOIN ETF, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have seen sizable outflows for three consecutive days since May 29 as BTC price appears to be consolidating after the recent rally. According to Farside Investors data , spot Bitcoin ETFs have bled $1.23 billion over the past three days, with BlackRock IBIT alone seeing $561.4 million in outflows in the past two days. Despite the massive outflows, BlackRock IBIT remains a top performer and is expected to hit a new high soon. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has predicted that BlackRock could become the biggest holder of Bitcoin by the end of next year, surpassing Satoshi, who has 1.123 million BTC. He said: “After only 16 months on the market, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) is the second-biggest holder of the token and on pace to pass Satoshi as the world’s largest by the end of 2026. IBIT has bought almost $50 billion worth of Bitcoin.” Unsurprisingly, IBIT is already the youngest ETF to be in the top 25 ETFs by value in over a decade, with over $70 billion in AUM, which is enough to rank it 23rd among the top ETFs.

In a Monday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said it intends to sell 2.5 million shares of its 10% Series A Stride Preferred Stock (STRD). The offering will be listed on the Nasdaq, with each share initially priced at $100, offering “institutional investors and select non-institutional investors” a 10% annual dividend yield. “Strategy intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of bitcoin and for working capital,” the company said in an official statement. The STRD offering marks Strategy’s third preferred stock issuance this year following its Strike (STRK) and Strife (STRF) offerings, in addition to its effort to raise $84 billion — a combination of both equity and debt — to fund future Bitcoin buys. STRK and STRF are convertible preferred stocks that offer a yield of 13% and 10%, respectively. Strategy is currently the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder after accumulating 580,955 BTC , currently valued at over $61 billion at current market prices. In the Monday announcement, Strategy also pointed out under what circumstances it can redeem the STRD shares. “Strategy will have the right, at its election, to redeem all, but not less than all, of the STRD stock, at any time, for cash if the total number of shares of all STRD stock then outstanding is less than 25% of the total number of shares of STRD stock originally issued in the offering and in any future offering, taken together,” it stated. Strategy’s plan of stockpiling Bitcoin has caused the company’s stock price to grow by more than double during the past year. As such, many publicly listed companies around the world have been mulling the possibility of becoming crypto treasury companies after witnessing the success of Strategy’s Bitcoin playbook. Bitcoin was recently changing hands around $106,613, a 2.4% increase over the past 24 hours, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko .

However, Lummis’s statements have also reignited discussions about whether there is a conflict of interest in his policy decisions.

Despite experiencing a significant uptick recently following Bitcoin’s price surge, concerns continue to grow that a deeper correction may be unfolding. Ethereum Price Crash To $2,000 Imminent Based on a new report by Master Ananda, a TradingView crypto analyst, the Ethereum market is flashing warning signs as its price struggles below the critical resistance zone. At press time, Ethereum is trading at approximately $2,605 after being rejected from a local high of around $2,788. Related Reading: Ethereum Price At $8,000: Pundit Predicts Parabolic Run For ETH Ethereum’s 4-hour chart presented by Master Ananda shows that the top altcoin has likely completed a short-term top, and now a corrective move is in play. The analysis hints at a looming price crash, with technical forecasts suggesting a retracement toward the $2,000 level or lower before the next bullish impulse. The analyst’s bearish continuation thesis appears to be a high-probability setup, with Ethereum expected to revisit lower Fibonacci retracement levels. Notably, the chart reveals a subtle bearish divergence forming as the price pushed slightly higher in May but with diminishing momentum. This, in turn, created a rising resistance line while volume and price action failed to confirm new highs. Noticeably, Ethereum’s price has since broken below the 0.230 Fibonacci level, signaling the possible start of a broader correction phase. The next probable support areas lie at $2,280 (0.382 Fib), $2,085 (0.5 Fib), and most significantly, the $1,900 price point at the 0.618 Fib Retracement level. The highlighted green zones in Master Ananda’s chart represent potential support and buying areas, which point to the $1,900 to $1,735 (0.618-0.786 Fib) range as the most likely zone for a higher low to form. The previous major low occurred on April 7, and the expectation is that this correction will end above that level. Until then, a short-term correction remains the most likely scenario, and traders are warned to take caution as the chart further highlights a possibly more resounding crash to $1,385. ETH Trade Strategy: Buy The Dip And Go Long While sharing his bearish thesis for Ethereum, Master Ananda also provided a clear strategy for investors and traders. He advised long-term holders to wait patiently for the projected drop and assess the support reaction before looking for clear reversal signals. Related Reading: Crypto Trader Dumps XRP Holdings For Ethereum, Explains Why Buying into support zones like $1,900 or even as low as $1,736 could provide optimal entry points for long-term positions. While bears may still attempt to short the market, Master Ananda assures that the downside remains limited. The analyst emphasizes the importance of planning and avoiding impulsive trading by creating ideal entry and exit points while respecting the prevailing market trend. With Ethereum’s bullish outlook still intact, this projected price crash could become an opportunity for many traders instead of a threat.

IBIT holds $68.83B in assets & 660,842 BTC, ranking as the #2 Bitcoin holder globally. Low fees and institutional trust drive IBIT’s strong lead over competitors like FBTC, GBTC. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has climbed the ranks in the exchange-traded fund (ETF) world at an incredible speed. Just 1.4 years into its launch and IBIT has already landed a spot among the top 25 largest ETFs globally when measured by assets.

The flagship coin successfully rebounded from a previous weekly resistance level of around $104k and is now signaling the onset of a fresh rally. Moreover, the heavy crypto liquidations in the past few days have cooled down the leveraged market, thus setting the stage for a fresh bull run.

Whale Investors on a Shopping Spree for Bitcoin According to on-chain data analysis from Santiment , around 151,820 Bitcoin wallets holding between 10 and 10k BTCs accumulated 79,244 coins in the past week. Consequently, the cohort now holds a cumulative 13.57 million Bitcoin.

Dimon said in his speech, “We should stockpile weapons, bullets, fighter jets, drones and rare earth elements.

According to experts, this attitude stems from the fact that concepts such as sovereign money and financial democratization contradict the traditional banking sector’s “leave your money in our hands” approach.

2025-06-03T21:02:26,"Binance Attracts $180 Billion in Stablecoin Deposits Year-to-Date","Binance is leading all centralized crypto exchanges in stablecoin reserves. According to the latest stats, the crypto exchange currently holds $31 billion in USDT and USDC, which is around 59% of total stablecoin holdings across the sector. This dominance highlights Binance’s outsized role in providing liquidity and facilitating stablecoin-denominated transactions. Stablecoin Inflows Favor Binance When assessing total crypto reserves, Coinbase tops the list with $129 billion in holdings, followed closely by Binance with $110 billion, comprising Bitcoin, ETH, USDT, and USDC, CryptoQuant data revealed. Collectively, the two exchanges have been found to control 60% of the total reserves among the top 20 centralized platforms. While Coinbase does not publicly disclose wallet-level Proof-of-Reserves (PoR), Binance distinguishes itself through on-chain reporting, including verifiable wallet addresses, which enhances its credibility in the crypto community. On the inflow front, Binance remains the top destination for stablecoins. In May alone, the exchange received $31 billion in USDT and USDC deposits, as it slightly edged out Coinbase at $30 billion. Year-to-date in 2025, Binance has attracted $180 billion in cumulative stablecoin inflows, which strengthens its role as a primary venue for capital allocation. More broadly, Coinbase and Binance lead in total crypto inflows this year, bringing in $344 billion and $335 billion, respectively. The figure is well ahead of competitors, which solidifies their continued dominance in institutional and retail capital flows. Notably, Binance also shows the highest average Bitcoin inflow per deposit, which implies that the exchange attracts large players. On May 22, when Bitcoin hit a record $112,000, Binance’s average BTC deposit surged to 7 BTC. In contrast, Bitfinex averaged 5 BTC, while OKX, Kraken, and Coinbase saw significantly lower figures at 1.23, 0.7, and 0.8 BTC, respectively, further indicating Binance’s pull among whales. Stablecoin Adoption Grows Beyond centralized exchange activity, broader stablecoin usage across the payments landscape also saw significant growth over the past two years. Between January 2023 and February 2025, stablecoin transactions reached $94.2 billion, according to analytics firm Artemis, which surveyed 20 stablecoin payment firms and included estimates from 11 others across sectors such as B2B, P2P, B2C, cards, and prefunding. Interestingly, Tron led as the top settlement network with about 60% of the volume, while Ethereum, BSC, and Polygon followed. “Overall, stablecoins have established themselves as growing and significant components of the global payment infrastructure, with expanding usage across transaction types and regions, pointing to their growing centrality in the international economic system.” The post Binance Attracts $180 Billion in Stablecoin Deposits Year-to-Date appeared first on CryptoPotato .",cryptopotato,https://cryptopotato.com/binance-attracts-180-billion-in-stablecoin-deposits-year-to-date/,"BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDC","AA News|Crypto News|Binance|Coinbase|Ethereum|Stablecoins|Tron",cryptocompare
2025-06-03T21:00:39,"Bitcoin Proponent Sets XRP Price Even If BTC Reaches $100 Million","XRP has recently drawn considerable attention following multiple ambitious forecasts regarding its long-term valuation. Supporters cite its increasing role in cross-border transactions, evolving regulatory clarity, and a rise in institutional adoption as key factors that could drive significant price growth. Several analysts have made bold projections. BarriC, a well-known crypto commentator, previously suggested that XRP could reach $100. Matthew Brienen, Chief Operating Officer at CryptoGuard, took the speculation further in April, projecting a $1,000 target for XRP. Some, like John Squire, have pushed expectations even higher, calling a $10,000 XRP valuation “conservative.” Bitcoin Maximalist Counters With Supply-Based Argument In sharp contrast, Rajat Soni, a Chartered Financial Analyst and strong proponent of Bitcoin, has dismissed such projections as unrealistic. He further argued that the circulating supply of XRP—100 billion tokens—makes such high price targets implausible. Soni compared XRP to Bitcoin, noting the latter’s capped supply of 21 million coins and divisibility into 2.1 quadrillion satoshis. Based on this structure, he concluded that one XRP equates to approximately 21,000 satoshis. When XRP was priced at $2.20, and 21,000 satoshis cost $22, Soni claimed that Bitcoin’s intrinsic value was already at least 1,000 times greater than XRP’s. According to Soni’s projections, if Bitcoin were to rise to $100 million, one satoshi would then equal $1. Using this ratio, he argued that XRP would struggle to exceed $20, as it would remain pegged to the relative value of 21,000 satoshis. He also highlighted inflationary implications. A $100 million Bitcoin, in his view, would signify a U.S. dollar devaluation of over 95%. In today’s terms, he noted, such a scenario would imply a Bitcoin value of around $5 million and an XRP equivalent of just $1 when adjusted for purchasing power. Current Market Metrics and Contradictory Performance At present, XRP is priced at $2.15, while Bitcoin trades at approximately $104,199, putting the XRP-to-BTC ratio at 0.00002053. If XRP were to reach $22 when Bitcoin is at $100 million, its ratio would decline to 0.00000020, a roughly 99% loss of value relative to Bitcoin. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 However, recent market performance does not support such a steep decline. XRP has gained 183% against Bitcoin since November 2024, contradicting the idea that it is consistently underperforming. If Bitcoin were to reach $100 million per coin, its market capitalization would rise to nearly $1.987 quadrillion. Maintaining its current dominance of 64.58%, the global crypto market cap would approach $3.076 quadrillion. Assuming XRP maintains its existing market share of 3.94% under these extreme conditions, its total market cap would climb to roughly $121.194 trillion. This would place XRP’s price near $1,244, which is a sharp contrast to Soni’s $20 limit. While predictions of XRP reaching $1,000 or more remain highly speculative, Soni’s assertion that the asset would be capped under $20 in a hyper-inflated crypto market also relies on rigid assumptions. The outcome will likely depend on future developments in utility, adoption, and macroeconomic trends, none of which can be accurately predicted with absolute certainty.

2025-06-03T20:57:07,"Why Isn’t the Anticipated Altcoin Season Here Yet? Analysts Explain the Real Reason","Evaluating the latest developments in the cryptocurrency markets, 10x Research revealed the main reasons why the altcoin season has not started in its published analysis. According to the report, despite Bitcoin trading at record levels and increasing institutional fund inflows, there is no significant movement in the altcoin market. According to analysts, this situation is caused by the lack of new trends in the market and the selling pressure caused by the unlocking of many tokens. Related News: How Will June Unfold for Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies? Calm or High Volatility Expected? According to 10x Research, the low liquidity environment makes it difficult to sustain the rise in altcoin prices. “The old scenario that once worked with hype and leverage is ineffective against the 4.5% US Treasury yield today,” the analysis said, noting that even Ethereum has quietly entered a period of 'staking for modest returns'. The analysis also stated that there is no need for huge capital to push the prices of altcoins up, and that a few large purchase orders can easily move the low liquidity market. However, it was stated that in order to sustain this rise, large-scale individual investor participation is required, and this is where the real problem begins. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-03T20:55:47,"BCP Technologies has launched tGBP, a British pound-backed stablecoin","BCP Technologies said it has launched its own British pound-backed stablecoin called tGBP. While many companies, such as Tether and poundtoken, have tried and failed to launch a successful British pound-backed stablecoin, BCP Technologies is going for gold with its newly launched stablecoin, tGBP. BCP Technologies introduces its tGBP British pound stablecoin BCP Technologies, a cryptocurrency firm registered in the United Kingdom, said it has launched a new British pound-backed stablecoin, Tokenised GBP (tGBP). The firm said it has approval from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority ( FCA ), and it announced the launch on June 3, 2025, in a statement. The tGBP stablecoin is now available for purchase to customers who successfully pass the KYC verification on BCP Technologies’ crypto trading platform, BCP Markets. According to the company, the stablecoin will soon be listed on multiple major cryptocurrency exchanges, with two major listings currently in advanced stages of negotiation. “There are two large exchanges that we are finalising details with. We are hoping to be able to announce these in the following weeks,” BCP Technologies’ CEO, Benoit Marzouk, said. The stablecoin was launched after an intensive 14-month submission process through the FCA Connect portal, and a one-month pilot run in the FCA regulatory sandbox, which is a controlled environment that allows firms to test innovative products with real consumers under regulatory supervision. GBP stablecoins are in short supply The tGBP stablecoin is built as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain and is backed on a 1:1 basis with British pounds held in segregated bank accounts. According to the company, this structure ensures both transparency and stability. “BCP proposes in the future to back tGBP with short-term UK government bonds, in line with the FCA discussion paper,” Marzouk told Cointelegraph. BCP Technologies, formerly BitcoinPoint, has undergone a transformation since it became an FCA-registered crypto asset service provider in 2021. “Historically, it was a platform ‘BitcoinPoint’ to democratise access to Bitcoin, where anyone could buy Bitcoin easily,” Marzouk explained. With the introduction of new regulations in 2020, the firm shifted from its cash-based services to a fully digital platform. With tGBP, individuals and businesses can hold the coin directly in their wallets as an alternative to traditional bank accounts. Like popular USD stablecoins such as USDT and USDC, coin offers an efficient way to send funds across borders and bypasses traditional banking delays and fees. Financial institutions can use tGBP as collateral in crypto-native lending and settlement processes, and the token is designed to facilitate settlements for tokenized real-world assets like securities, bonds, or real estate. “Our vision is to abstract the complexity of blockchain with the familiarity of a GBP denomination, ultimately replacing GBP e-money with our GBP stablecoin,” Marzouk said in the company’s announcement. According to data from CoinGecko , only two British pound stablecoins, VNX British Pound (VGBP) and Celo British Pound (CGBP), are currently tracked. Together, they both have a market capitalization of under $500,000. Other projects like poundtoken (GBPT), which was launched by Blackfridge in 2022, and GBPA, developed by Agant, also exist but have yet to see meaningful adoption. Even Tether , the issuer of the world’s most widely used stablecoin (USDT), failed to make a significant impact with its British pound offering launched in 2022.
