2025-06-04T16:55:52,"$400,000,000 Coinbase Hack Linked to India-Based Employee Caught Taking Photos of Computer Screen: Report","Coinbase’s massive data breach was reportedly linked to an outsourcing firm operating in India. An India-based employee of the U.S. outsourcing firm TaskUs took photos of her work computer with her personal phone but was caught, according to a new Reuters report , which cited five anonymous former TaskUs employees. The woman allegedly had been paid by hackers to pass along Coinbase customer information and had a suspected accomplice. Three of the anonymous former TaskUs employees and “a person familiar with the matter” told Reuters that Coinbase was notified right away. The “person familiar with the matter” reportedly says the security issue happened in January. Coinbase claims it learned about the incident after receiving an email last month demanding a $20 million Bitcoin ( BTC ) payoff in exchange for not releasing the illegally obtained info. The exchange says criminals bribed a small group of overseas customer support agents to copy the data of less than 1% of the firm’s monthly transacting users. A recent filing with the Maine Attorney General’s Office indicates the breach impacted 69,461 people. Coinbase notes that hacked information includes names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, masked social security numbers (the last 4 digits only), masked bank-account numbers, some bank account identifiers, government-ID images, account data and limited corporate data. The company refused to give in to the hackers’ demand and estimates it will pay $180 million to $400 million in remediation costs and voluntary customer reimbursements. The exchange reportedly told Reuters it had “cut ties with the TaskUs personnel involved and other overseas agents, and tightened controls.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-04T16:48:36,"JPMorgan opens crypto access beyond a case-by-case basis","JPMorgan will start letting its trading and wealth clients borrow cash using crypto-related assets as collateral, according to Bloomberg. The plan kicks off in the next few weeks, starting with loans backed by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust. The bank will also start counting crypto assets in some clients’ net worth calculations, putting Bitcoin and other digital holdings in the same category as stocks, cars, and artwork. That matters because it affects how much money clients can borrow from the bank. This new model will apply to all of JPMorgan’s wealth clients worldwide, including both retail and ultra-high-net-worth clients. JPMorgan opens crypto access beyond a case-by-case basis Before this change, JPMorgan only accepted crypto ETFs as loan collateral under specific conditions. With this new system, the bank is going wide, starting with BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF and then expanding to other exchange-traded crypto products later. These changes are coming at a time when demand for crypto access among clients is climbing, and the federal stance on digital assets is becoming more relaxed. Jamie Dimon, the bank’s CEO, has stayed critical of Bitcoin. During the May investor day, he said, “I don’t think we should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin, go at it.” He made it even clearer earlier this year at the 2024 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “Bitcoin does nothing. I call it the pet rock,” Jamie said. “This is the last time I’m talking about this with CNBC, so help me God.” Despite that view, the bank has been working with crypto platforms for years. It uses blockchain tech for internal services and counts Coinbase among its clients. These new credit policies show that while Jamie is not a fan of Bitcoin, JPMorgan has no problem profiting from it as long as there’s client demand. Trump administration clears barriers for Wall Street Trump’s return to the White House in January 2025 has changed how US regulators treat crypto. The FDIC and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency have scrapped previous anti-crypto policies. Even the Federal Reserve has stepped back, though not completely. There’s still a 2023 notice in effect that limits some crypto-related bank activities. But thanks to the repeal of SAB 121, banks are now allowed to custody crypto, something that was previously off-limits. Since these regulatory rollbacks, crypto has exploded. Bitcoin broke a new all-time high in May, reaching $111,980, just a few months after Trump’s election win in November 2024. ETFs tied to Bitcoin, which launched in the US in January 2024, now manage about $128 billion. That’s one of the fastest product growth rates Wall Street has seen. Trump has been actively pushing crypto policies since taking office. The industry also helped him return to power with major donations. His family businesses have moved into crypto too, getting involved in Bitcoin mining and launching memecoins. The political backing has been a major factor in the policy changes that are letting banks like JPMorgan and its rivals get deeper into the crypto industry. Morgan Stanley is also making moves. The bank is working on adding crypto trading to its E*Trade platform, according to Bloomberg. At Davos, Ted Pick, Morgan Stanley’s CEO, said the bank is looking for new ways to get involved in the crypto market under Trump’s leadership. Even with all the new opportunities, Jamie Dimon still warns about crypto risks. He has mentioned concerns about money laundering, sex trafficking, terrorism, and unclear asset ownership when discussing Bitcoin. But none of that is stopping his bank from making it part of clients’ loan agreements and wealth evaluations. This change from JPMorgan makes it easier for clients to use crypto for real-world finance, just like they would with any other asset.

Prominent platforms like Coinbase and Gemini are registered with the FCA as Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), offering secure and transparent crypto services to UK users. Additionally, HM Treasury and the Bank of England contribute significantly to shaping the nation’s digital asset regulations.

2025-06-04T16:46:07,"Bitcoin Critic Jamie Dimon’s Company JPMorgan Makes Major Cryptocurrency Move","JPMorgan Chase & Co., the largest U.S. bank, is rolling out plans to lend to its customers by accepting exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to cryptocurrencies as collateral. The move is seen as one of the biggest moves from Wall Street since President Donald Trump pledged to support loosening regulations on the crypto sector. JPMorgan will begin providing financing in the coming weeks against some crypto ETFs, starting with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, according to people familiar with the matter. The bank will also factor in its asset management clients’ crypto holdings in its total net worth and liquid assets calculations. The change would see cryptocurrencies treated similarly to asset classes such as stocks, cars or works of art. Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Continues to Announce More Listings - Now Listing a Billion-Dollar Altcoin JPMorgan was an early adopter of blockchain technology in areas such as payments and has started working with crypto exchanges such as Coinbase. However, CEO Jamie Dimon has kept his distance from cryptocurrencies as an individual. Dimon, who said he was “not a fan” of Bitcoin at the investor day in May, said he still defended customers’ right to buy Bitcoin, saying, “I don’t support smoking, but I do support your right to smoke. I also support your right to buy Bitcoin.” This change in asset management will cover all of JPMorgan’s client segments worldwide, with both individual investors and high-net-worth individuals eligible to benefit. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-04T16:41:15,"Bitcoin Rainbow Chart predicts BTC price for June 30, 2025","As Bitcoin ( BTC ) hovers around the $105,000 mark, the Rainbow Chart suggests the asset will likely stay above six figures by the end of June. This chart uses a logarithmic regression curve based on Bitcoin’s historical price data. It’s color-coded to reflect market sentiment, divided into nine distinct bands, ranging from deep undervaluation to extreme overvaluation. For June 30, 2025, the Rainbow Chart projects a potential Bitcoin price range from $33,670 to $381,342, depending on market dynamics. Bitcoin Rainbow chart. Source: BlockhainCenter At the lower end, the “Basically a Fire Sale” zone spans $33,669.71 to $44,134.48, signaling a rare bargain. Just above it, the “BUY!” band ranges from $44,134.48 to $59,711.44, followed by “Accumulate,” from $59,711.44 to $77,365.08. Further up, the “Still Cheap” zone runs from $77,365.08 to $100,268.08, leading into the current range, “HODL!”, which spans $100,268.08 to $131,761.75. Beyond this point, sentiment shifts into more speculative territory. The “Is this a bubble?” band covers $131,761.75 to $168,381.26, hinting at potential market froth. That’s followed by “FOMO Intensifies,” from $168,381.26 to $216,493.85, where investor enthusiasm tends to spike. Higher still, the chart enters warning territory. “Sell. Seriously, SELL!” covers $216,493.85 to $282,752.48, typically associated with overheated markets. At the top lies “Maximum Bubble Territory,” ranging from $282,752.48 to $381,341.76—suggesting extreme overvaluation. Bitcoin price analysis Meanwhile, Bitcoin was trading at $105,478 at press time, down over 1% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Given this price, Bitcoin currently falls within the “HODL!” band, indicating it’s neither deeply undervalued nor in bubble territory. Bitcoin is likely to trade in this band at the end of June if the market momentum remains the same. At the same time, sentiment remains bullish overall. Bitcoin is trading above its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $99,700 and 200-day SMA of $87,070, which signals a strong upward trend. Meanwhile, the 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) is 54.22, pointing to neutral-to-slightly bullish momentum without overbought conditions.

These new products are tied to the performance of the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), which has recently experienced substantial growth.While this development signals Russia’s continued embrace of crypto, the futures contracts are available only to qualified investors. This reflects the country’s cautious approach to regulating digital assets.Moscow Exchange Rolls Out Bitcoin FuturesThe Moscow Exchange's futures contracts will be linked to the value of the IBIT. They will be traded in US dollars per lot, with settlements processed in Russian rubles. The futures will be offered quarterly, with the first expiring in September 2025. Notably, MOEX step aligns with recent developments in the Russian financial system. The government has made strides to allow more crypto-linked products within a controlled environment. The Bank of Russia approved the issuance of derivative instruments and securities tied to the value of crypto for qualified investors in May 2025. However, the central bank remains cautious, advising against direct crypto investments for most financial organizations and their clients.IBIT’s Positive Ascent Russia’s growing interest in crypto comes amid broader shifts in global financial markets. The success of the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF underscores the increasing institutional adoption of crypto-based financial products. This move comes just days after IBIT’s impressive rise to become one of the world’s top 25 exchange-traded funds by assets under management (AUM). According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, IBIT has accumulated $72.4 billion in AUM.Despite the success of IBIT, the Bank of Russia maintains caution by limiting such offerings to qualified investors.Sberbank Expands Bitcoin-Investment ProductsMeanwhile, Russia’s largest bank, Sberbank, is planning to launch a new investment product tied to Bitcoin’s price movements. These structured bonds are currently available to a select group of qualified investors via the over-the-counter market. Unlike typical crypto investments, the structured bonds provide exposure to Bitcoin without requiring a crypto wallet or dealing with unregulated foreign platforms.

2025-06-04T16:18:59,"Max Keiser Predicts Bitcoin to Reach $2.2M Amid New Bill Debate","Max Keiser, an American filmmaker and Bitcoin (BTC) advocate, has warned that the U.S. economy is in serious trouble. In a recent X post, he described it as a Ponzi scheme because of the growing budget deficit. At the same time, he believes Bitcoin will rise to $2.2 million and become a haven when the economy fails. His comments came after a new bill was introduced in Congress that experts say will worsen the budget deficit. One Big Beautiful Bill Act Sparks Debate The proposed bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), was introduced by Senate Republicans, led by Majority Leader John Thune, after President Donald Trump returned to the White House in 2024. This proposed law aims to add $150 billion in defense spending. This bill has caused a stir in the crypto community. Elon Musk, a billionaire entrepreneur, publicly criticized it. Musk said the bill would push the budget deficit to an unsustainable $2.5 trillion. He called the bill dangerous for taxpayers and harmful to the economy’s long-term health. Others, including California Governor Gavin Newsom, agreed with Musk’s concerns. Musk was a strong supporter of Donald Trump during the 2024 elections. Since then, Tesla’s CEO has been involved with the Trump administration. He led the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.), which focused on cutting wasteful government spending. Musk has officially stepped down from his government role recently , stating that improving federal operations proved an “uphill battle.” Musk believes the U.S. could face bankruptcy if it does not take urgent steps to grow its productivity and reduce government spending. Max Keiser Calls The U.S. Economy a Ponzi Scheme Max Keiser responded to Musk’s post by saying the U.S. economy is like a Ponzi scheme that cannot be fixed with small changes. He believes the growing debt is too big to manage with minor spending cuts. Meanwhile, many industry leaders have also raised concerns about the U.S. growing debt. Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, said the U.S. dollar’s position as the world’s top currency is not guaranteed. He warned that America’s debt crisis is pushing investors to rethink their strategies. Bitcoin as a Safe Haven Max Keiser firmly believes that Bitcoin will ultimately win if the U.S. economy collapses. He said the country’s financial crisis has made the digital coin more appealing to investors. Many see it as a hedge against the failure of traditional financial systems. The American filmmaker has predicted since 2021 that Bitcoin’s price will reach $2.2 million, calling it digital gold . Keiser thinks that, compared to Bitcoin, almost all other financial systems are weak and could lose value.

Sygnum's June 2025 outlook sounds an alarm that the liquid supply of Bitcoin has decreased by 30% over the past 18 months, as ETFs, corporate treasuries, and long-term holders continue draining coins from exchanges. The Numbers: Where Did All the Bitcoin Go? Sygnum analysts note a dismal trend: more than 1 million BTC have departed exchanges since the end of 2023. The perpetrators? Spot Bitcoin ETFs—now the ”marginal buyer” of BTC — corporate purchasers, and new government appetite for Bitcoin reserves. The report states ETF inflows have topped $375 million on one day in this June, led by funds such as ARKB and FBTC. This hoarding is reducing the tradable float, making it more difficult for traders to get liquidity and simpler for price to shoot up on new demand. ”Bitcoin's rapidly diminishing liquid supply is building the foundations for demand shocks and upside volatility,” Sygnum said in its monthly outlook. ETFs, States, and the Halving Lag What's different this time? First, institutional demand is incessant. Bitcoin ETFs have had only four days of withdrawals since April, and U.S. states like New Hampshire and Texas are making laws in order to allow Bitcoin reserves. Outside of the U.S., Pakistan and even a ruling U.K. party are inquiring about official BTC allotments. While these government purchases remain largely symbolic as of yet, Sygnum warns that ”when these commence, they could become a leading driver of price motion higher, both because of the demand it injects and because of the signaling factor.”. Second, the latest halving cut new supply in half, exactly when demand is building up. Miners' inventories are low, and with fewer coins to sell, any purchasing urge will drive BTC prices dramatically higher. Lessons from Past Supply Shocks History also shows that when the liquid supply of Bitcoin dries up, price action can be very spectacular. In past cycles, gigantic rallies have followed gigantic accumulation by institutionals and long-term players. Sygnum's analysis suggests the current setup even more so, with the ”whale ratio” of large holders at record lows — a traditional sign of bullish activity. ”Substantial demand will have a large multiplier effect, i.e., each $1 of demand causing, for example, $20-30 of added market capitalization,” says Sygnum's research head, Katalin Tischhauser. What Could Push BTC Over $110K? ETF inflows: As pensions and funds increasingly invest in Bitcoin, even modest amounts could trigger out-of-proportion price action. Government reserves: Governments or states stepping in to buy, the signaling effect alone may cause FOMO. Safe-haven demand: With dollar vulnerability and U.S. Treasury unsafety, investors are seeking refuge: gold and Bitcoin are the go-to. Halving lag: It will likely not be until several months from now before the full impact of April's halving is even realized, but as new supply declines, the potential for a demand shock multiplier remains elevated. Social Buzz Crypto Twitter is filled with speculation of a fresh ”ETF-driven supercycle.” Specialists point to the insatiable flows of ETFs and the drying-up of exchange balances as a recipe for supply shock. ”If this keeps going, BTC at $110K or even $130K isn't crazy,” wrote @BTCMacro. Other experts warn of volatility: with so little liquidity, even small sell-offs could trigger sudden dives, but the bias, for the time being, is firmly to the upside. With Bitcoin supply at multi-year lows and demand on the rise only, Sygnum's warning is clear: the next breakout may be closer—and more severe—than anyone can imagine.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9435/bitcoin-s-next-breakout-sygnum-sees-supply-shock-brewing,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-06-04T16:01:34,"Litecoin Holds Support Level as Layer-2 Launch Signals Broader Utlity","Litecoin LTC is clinging to key technical support around $89 as a mix of fundamental and macro developments shape its short-term outlook, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model. The cryptocurrency traded in a tight range over the last 24 hours, testing lows near $88.92 before recovering. Despite forming a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern, volume support at $89 suggests buyers are stepping in. This stability comes amid broader market uncertainty. The CD20 index of major cryptocurrencies fell around 1% over the same period, reflecting reduced risk appetite as geopolitical tensions and a weakening U.S. dollar shift capital toward hard assets like gold. Still, Litecoin is seeing new tech upgrades and rising interest. Lunar Digital Assets recently launched LitVM, a zero-knowledge Layer-2 network for Litecoin. Built on BitcoinOS and Polygon’s CDK, the system introduces EVM-compatible smart contracts and allows cross-chain swaps with Bitcoin BTC and Cardano ADA. These features aim to boost Litecoin’s role in decentralized finance while addressing long-standing security risks around blockchain bridges. Litecoin also continues to see growing retail access. IG Group added LTC among various other tokens as it launched crypto trading in the UK. It's impact, given the cryptocurrency's scale, is likely to be limited if any.

2025-06-04T16:00:24,"Certified Analyst Says Bitcoin Dominance Could Reverse At 64% – Is It Time For Altcoin Season?","Bitcoin’s current price action is marked by a consolidation around the $105,500 price level. Although it reached an intraday high of $106,807, it has since returned to $105,500, and its dominance also witnessed a minor fall. Notably, Bitcoin’s dominance metric, the BTC.D, which measures its share of the total crypto market capitalization, has stalled around the 64% level in recent weeks. This stalling behavior drew attention from a certified market analyst, especially in light of many altcoins struggling to gain momentum in an environment dominated by Bitcoin’s inflow. BTC Dominance Hits Resistance, Candlestick Flash Warnings According to certified Level III CMT analyst Tony “The Bull” Severino, the 64% region on the Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) chart could mark a meaningful reversal point. Sharing his insights alongside a technical chart of Bitcoin’s market cap dominance on the monthly timeframe, Severino pointed out that the latest monthly candlestick formed a Doji right at the bottom of a previous Falling Window. Related Reading: Altcoin Season: Bitcoin Dominance Reaches Critical Level Above 64% In Japanese candlestick theory, such “windows” are not just gaps to be filled but serve as critical zones of support or resistance. The fact that BTC.D formed a Doji candle precisely at this window, according to Severino, is a textbook reaction suggesting the dominance rally may be losing strength. This candlestick structure brings the focus onto how the current monthly candlestick plays out. If the current monthly candle becomes an Evening Star candlestick and closes below 62%, the odds of Bitcoin dominance rolling over increase significantly. Altcoin Season Not Quite There Yet As noted by Tony, if Bitcoin’s dominance candlestick this month forms an Evening Star pattern and closes below 62%, it has a high possibility of marking the end of the cryptocurrency’s current dominance. However, the analyst added a key caveat: the BTC.D Relative Strength Index (RSI) closed the previous month above 70, still suggesting strong momentum and keeping the larger trend in flux. Related Reading: Is Altcoin Season Over Or It Never Started? Here’s What Historical Data Says Despite these early signals, Severino warned against jumping the gun. Although the technical evidence points to a possible short-term reversal in dominance, he clarified that it does not necessarily guarantee a full-fledged altcoin season. In his words, “I am still not of the mindset that we will get a typical altcoin season, but I am seeing some of the first signs that BTC.D might reverse here.” For now, Bitcoin continues to hold steady above $105,000, and until BTC.D breaks convincingly below 62%, the cryptocurrency is in dominance. Nonetheless, the altcoin market could soon be looking at its first real window of opportunity in months. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $105,500, down by 0.1% in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin dominance is currently at 63.1%, down by 0.57% in the past 24 hours. Ethereum, on the other hand, increased its market share by 2.13% to 9.6%.

2025-06-04T16:00:05,"Crypto And The Trumps: The Untold Story, According To Don Jr.","US President Donald Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., says his family turned to Bitcoin and crypto after facing banking roadblocks. According to a recent CNBC Squawk Box interview , the Trump Organization suddenly found it hard to borrow money once political winds shifted. That forced them to look for other ways to keep projects moving. In the interview, Trump Jr. stressed that this move wasn’t about chasing a trend. It was about finding a lifeline when banks stopped answering their calls. Banking Doors Closed Trump Jr. said that before his father took office, banks in New York treated the family like any other developer. Loans were easy to get. Deals went through fast. Then, in January 2017, everything changed. Banks stopped returning calls and froze out even long‐standing projects. “We’re all in on crypto,” says @DonaldJTrumpJR of his family’s ties with stablecoins and $BTC . “We got into crypto not because it was the next cool thing, we got into it out of necessity.” https://t.co/YnJK5JMmBT — Squawk Box (@SquawkCNBC) June 3, 2025 Based on reports, Trump Jr. said the family couldn’t get basic financing, despite having solid records and valuable real estate. He added that they felt the same hurdles everyday Americans face, from loan denials to high fees. That shift made him and his brother Eric realize the system wasn’t built to treat everyone fairly. So they started to look beyond traditional finance. Turning To Crypto In the same interview, Trump Jr. explained why blockchain caught his eye. He pointed to title insurance, a process that can be slow and expensive. He saw an opportunity to make real estate deals faster and cheaper using crypto tools. According to Trump Jr., blockchain could speed up basic tasks without middlemen taking big cuts. He said it wasn’t about jumping on a buzzword. It was about finding a way to keep projects alive. He described the decision as a “necessary pivot” after banks slammed the door shut. Debate Over Meme Coin The Trump family’s move into crypto also includes a meme coin tied to the Trump name. Trump Jr. said he wasn’t part of that project. He called it a “proof of concept” to show how blocked‐off people can still raise money. In mid‐January 2025, President Trump launched the TRUMP coin, and Melania Trump rolled out MELANIA. It’s said that Trump‐affiliated groups hold 80% of both coins. That raises questions about influence. Critics worry that meme coins can let actors send money to those in power without clear records. Trump Jr. says crypto’s anonymous nature makes it tough to link funds directly to politicians. He added that insiders thanked him for shining a light on the space, not complaining about the project.

2025-06-04T15:53:09,"John Bollinger Suggests Bitcoin Rally May Be Exhausting","John Bollinger highlights a ""Three Pushes to a High"" pattern on Bitcoin, signaling the end of its rally phase, with potential exhaustion ahead. Bitcoin's price has recently been hovering around $105K, showing a -0.99% drop in the last 24 hours and a 3.39% decline in the past week. Despite this, the price has still managed to stay within a range of $103K to $108K over recent days.This stability, however, might be short-lived, as several technical indicators suggest that Bitcoin's current upward momentum is weakening. John Bollinger, the inventor of the Bollinger Bands indicator, has pointed out signs of potential exhaustion, raising questions about the sustainability of Bitcoin's rally.https://twitter.com/bbands/status/1930196382062658045Bollinger Bands Suggest Potential ExhaustionAs Bitcoin continues to climb, it has frequently touched or surpassed the Upper Bollinger Band. This repeated action indicates heightened volatility and suggests that the asset might be nearing the limits of its bullish push.The formation of a ""Three Pushes to a High"" pattern adds further weight to these concerns. In this pattern, Bitcoin made three successive attempts to break higher, but with each push, the price has achieved smaller gains.The first push reached $93,777 in late April, the second hit $104,063 in early May, and the third touched an all-time high of $111,800 later in May. The diminishing returns from each successive attempt signal weakening buying pressure and a potential end to the rally.Momentum is Gradually DecliningMeanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) also presents additional insight into Bitcoin's overbought condition. As of June 4, the RSI reached an unusually high level, suggesting that Bitcoin's price may soon face a correction or a period of consolidation. The overbought condition is particularly evident as the RSI surpasses the 0.7 mark, a typical signal of an overstretched market. Bitcoin’s momentum also appears to be slowing down. The momentum indicator, represented by a black line on the chart, rises in tandem with Bitcoin's price but starts to decline after reaching the recent all-time high. John Bollinger mentioned that the ""Three Pushes to a High"" pattern on Bitcoin's chart marked the end of the current rally phase. Meanwhile, one commenter expressed the view that the current signals indicate a local exhaustion, suggesting that a pullback or consolidation phase is more likely than a full trend reversal. In response, Bollinger agreed, stating that he shares the same perspective. When asked whether Bitcoin was about to hit the lower Bollinger Band, Bollinger replied that he was uncertain and would be looking for the next good setup.Declining Inflows from Large HoldersThe market has seen a sharp decline in the activity of large Bitcoin holders, further supporting the notion of a slowing rally. Bitcoin Large Holders Inflow Bitcoin Large Holders Inflow In the last week, the large holders' inflow dropped by 49.17%. Over the past month, the metric has fallen by 10.25%, and in the last 90 days, it has plunged by a significant 95.16%. This sharp decline in large-holder activity suggests that institutional and high-net-worth investors are pulling back.Crypto Beast Calls for Altcoin DiversificationAmid the uncertainty surrounding Bitcoin’s price action, seasoned crypto analyst Crypto Beast has advised investors to shift their focus toward altcoins. He pointed out that Bitcoin’s rally, which saw a 121% increase last year and a near 13% rise this year, may be nearing its peak. While Bitcoin's market cap dominance has been trending upwards, Crypto Beast suggests that the real opportunities now lie within the altcoin market. He also noted that Bitcoin dominance is close to its resistance level, suggesting an imminent decline that would likely benefit altcoins.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/04/john-bollinger-suggests-bitcoin-rally-may-be-exhausting/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=john-bollinger-suggests-bitcoin-rally-may-be-exhausting,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Market|Trending Now|Bitcoin Price Prediction|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today",cryptocompare
2025-06-04T15:51:09,"Spanish Coffee Chain Vanadi Wants to Invest $1B in Bitcoin: Report","The list of companies embracing bitcoin and adding the digital asset to their corporate treasuries continues to grow by the day. The Spanish coffee chain Vanadi Coffee may become the latest addition to that list if its board of directors approves a proposal to invest €1 billion (over $1.1 billion) in BTC. Local media Alicante Plaza reported that Vanadi will propose making a billion-dollar investment in bitcoin during the next shareholders’ meeting slated for June 29. Spanish Coffee Chain to Invest in BTC The first Spanish coffee chain to go public, Vanadi was launched in 2021. Since its inception, it has established six locations, comprising a bakery and five cafes. The entity intends to have three more by the end of 2025 and a total of 15 by 2026. Last year, Vanadi recorded losses of more than €3.3 million ($3.7 million), 15% more than the figure seen in 2023. On the other hand, revenue for 2024 remained stable at roughly €2 million ($2.28 million). Vanadi launched its initial public offering (IPO) with a starting price per share of €3.28 ($3.74) and a capitalization of €20 million ($22.8 million). Within the last two years, the stock, VANA, has fallen 99%, trading around €0.33 ($0.38) at the time of writing, according to data from TradingView. This is regardless of Vanadi’s 10-to-1 reverse stock split in March – for every 10 shares of VANA held before the split, shareholders received one new share. This was done to reduce the number of outstanding shares and possibly increase the price. Besides the poor performance of Vanadi’s stock, the coffee chain does not expect to make a profit until 2027, when it may record a gross operating profit of at least €23,000. However, Bitcoin may change this. A Bitcoin-first Approach Vanadi reportedly plans to transition into a bitcoin-first company, adopting the cryptocurrency as a treasury reserve asset. According to reports, this is not just an attempt to capitalize on the path to recovery that Bitcoin offers but a full pivot from coffee to the leading digital asset. Vanadi is following the footsteps of leading corporate entities, such as the business intelligence firm Strategy and the Japanese investment company Metaplanet . If the board of directors approves the proposal, the move could maximize shareholder value and foster business growth. VANA is already up 15% since news of the proposal emerged. Meanwhile, Vanadi’s board chairman, Salvador Martí, facilitated the acquisition of 5 BTC for $521,000 two weeks ago. Around the same time, the company revealed it had received two binding proposals to purchase BTC for €50 million ($56.9 million) each.

In an X post today, Messari noted that three companies—VivoPower, Wellgistics, and Webus International—are planning to purchase and hold XRP as a treasury reserve asset.Webus to Set Up $300M XRP Reserve.Specifically, Webus International filed with the U.S. SEC to raise $300 million through non-equity funding to create a strategic XRP reserve. The Nasdaq-listed company would fund the XRP treasury plan using its available cash reserves, institutional-backed credit facilities, and shareholders’ guarantees. According to the filing, Webus will develop the strategic XRP reserve in collaboration with Samara Alpha Management. Once established, the company will leverage the reserve to support its global payment solutions. VivoPower Reserve Plan In addition, Messari noted that Nasdaq-listed VivoPower is earmarking around $121 million to create a strategic XRP reserve. Although the Messari tweet suggests that VivoPower plans to invest around $121 million in XRP, the company’s official announcement referred to this amount as the funds raised in a recent private placement.Notably, Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Abdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia led the private placement. Per the announcement, a significant portion of the $121 million will be used to purchase and hold XRP as a treasury reserve asset. This move aligns with VivoPower’s goal to transform itself into the world’s first XRP-focused enterprise. Wellgistics Health Secures $50M for XRP ReserveFurther, Messari highlighted Wellgistics Health as the third company exploring the XRP treasury strategy. Recall that the publicly traded health company secured $50 million last month to adopt XRP as a treasury reserve asset. Additionally, Wellgistics announced plans to leverage XRP for real-time payments, aiming to eliminate the barriers of traditional payment systems. Growing Interest in XRP as a Reserve Asset At the moment, there is a growing trend among institutions to adopt XRP as a reserve asset. In addition to VivoPower, Wellgistics, and Webus, other companies are also considering adding XRP to their balance sheets. In December, Worksport revealed plans to acquire XRP and Bitcoin as treasury reserve assets using 10% of its operational cash. Last month, Ault Capital Group (ACG) announced that it will invest $10 million in XRP this year, supporting its expansion into the financial services sector. Interestingly, the United States also named XRP among the assets that could be included in its digital asset stockpile.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/04/messari-highlights-growing-interest-in-xrp-as-a-treasury-reserve-asset/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=messari-highlights-growing-interest-in-xrp-as-a-treasury-reserve-asset,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP","Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today",cryptocompare

2025-06-04T15:33:14,"Researcher Says This Bitcoin Cycle Feels Like 2017, When BTC Surged Over 5,000%","Joe Burnett, Director of Market Research at Unchained, says today’s Bitcoin market dynamics are strikingly similar to those during the explosive 2017 bull run. In a recent market analysis , Burnett highlighted strong parallels between the current Bitcoin cycle and the dramatic 2017 bull market. According to him, while the 2020–2021 season brought significant growth, the momentum of those years didn’t quite match the parabolic energy seen in 2017.For context, from January 2016 to December 2017, the price of Bitcoin soared by 5,640%, rising from $350 to $20,089. Meanwhile, the 2020/2021 cycle delivered an 8X surge with BTC rising from $6,900 to $68,000.Burnett suggested that key headwinds such as China’s mining ban and FTX’s ""paper Bitcoin"" activity may have dampened the 2021 season. Meanwhile, the 2024–2025 season is shaping up differently.Altcoin Mania Then, Bitcoin Treasury Mania NowBurnett recalls how, in 2017, altcoin speculation indirectly drove demand for Bitcoin. At the time, most users had to buy Bitcoin first in order to access altcoins on other exchanges, especially since Coinbase only listed a handful of assets. This created what Burnett calls a “black hole” effect, where speculative capital was drawn into Bitcoin as a gateway asset.Today, a similar dynamic is playing out, but this time through Bitcoin treasury companies. Firms like Strategy and MetaPlanet are raising capital by issuing equity and using those proceeds to acquire Bitcoin. This effectively converts speculative equity demand into Bitcoin buying pressure.Notably, as previously reported, 12 companies joined the Bitcoin treasury trend in May.ETF Inflows and Institutional Demand Add FuelAnother critical factor supporting the bullish outlook is the continued influx of institutional capital via spot Bitcoin ETFs . These inflows represent a robust and sustained source of demand that, when combined with speculative flows into Bitcoin-focused companies, could set the stage for another vertical move in Bitcoin’s price.Notably, firms like BlackRock have acquired over 600,000 BTC over the past year amid their ETF listings.Setting the Stage for a Parabolic MoveBurnett concludes that if these trends hold and macroeconomic conditions remain relatively favorable, the Bitcoin market could be nearing the beginning of another parabolic phase.The confluence of strong fundamentals, institutional adoption, and speculative interest could recreate the kind of rapid price acceleration not seen since Bitcoin’s historic run to $20,000 in late 2017. Bitcoin is trading at $105,000 at press time, and some industry commentators believe prices as high as $500,000 could be a target this season.When Altcoin Season?Meanwhile, concerns have emerged that the rotation of capital into ETFs and Bitcoin-related investments is delaying the prospects of an altcoin season. Some analysts suggest that altcoins now need a new narrative to thrive alongside Bitcoin, as the typical rotation trend may be over.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/04/researcher-says-this-bitcoin-cycle-feels-like-2017-when-btc-surged-over-5000/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=researcher-says-this-bitcoin-cycle-feels-like-2017-when-btc-surged-over-5000,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Market|Bitcoin Price Prediction|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today",cryptocompare

2025-06-04T15:30:00,"The Convergence of TradFi and Digital Asset Markets – A Maturing Ecosystem","The line between traditional and crypto markets is actively being redrawn. As digital asset markets mature, the convergence of traditional finance (TradFi) and digital markets is accelerating, resulting in a more mature, institutional-grade ecosystem shaped by the frameworks, expectations and operational resilience that have historically characterized TradFi. Recent developments underscore a paradigm shift in how digital assets are perceived by institutions. The U.S. government’s announcement of a strategic digital asset reserve, consisting of bitcoin, ether, XRP, solana and cardano, signals strong institutional validation. In parallel, more than eleven U.S. states have shown interest in or are actively working on bitcoin treasury bills. Sovereign investors such as the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) have disclosed significant positions, with a $436.9 million stake in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) as of December 31, 2024. These aren’t speculative moves, but rather concerted investments to stay at the forefront of an evolving financial system. Support from these governments is reinforcing institutional engagement, marking a turning point where the risk of missing out outweighs the risk of exposure to the digital assets ecosystem. The evolution of digital asset market infrastructure Previously, institutional participation in digital assets was constrained by high volatility, regulatory uncertainty and fragmented infrastructure. Now, regulated custodians offer institutional-grade solutions, while trading platforms provide improved access and reliable execution. The expansion of risk management tools — including hedging, credit facilities and market surveillance — has enhanced the operational stability for a space once known for volatility. These developments have lowered barriers to entry, enabling traditional institutions to approach digital assets with familiar risk and compliance frameworks. Financial products driving convergence Institutional adoption is further fueled by products that mirror traditional markets while leveraging blockchain advantages. Today’s institutional offerings include spot & derivatives markets, yield-bearing products, ETFs & in-kind redemptions and depositary receipts — all designed with similar underwriting logic and performance expectations. The expansion of futures, options and structured products in crypto mirrors the mechanics of TradFi derivatives. These instruments provide price discovery, risk hedging and speculative capabilities that align with institutional mandates. Yield-bearing products like staking, crypto lending and tokenized fixed-income are being designed with yield profiles resembling TradFi. These structures provide fixed or floating returns while incorporating risk metrics familiar to institutions. One of the most popular products has been spot bitcoin ETPs. Nasdaq’s proposed in-kind redemptions for BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF further align crypto ETFs with traditional counterparts, boosting efficiency and liquidity. Additionally, crypto depositary receipts enable institutions to access digital assets without direct custody, bridging traditional markets and crypto in a regulated, familiar structure. Institutional investors are engaging through structures that blend traditional and digital techniques: hybrid funds, separately managed accounts (SMAs) and bespoke mandates. These tailor exposure while maintaining operational familiarity, providing institutions with regulated pathways to participate in this evolving ecosystem. Institutional comfort and adoption trends Regulatory clarity remains critical. Recent SEC moves and a more crypto-forward administration signal openness to clearer frameworks, encouraging increased institutional engagement. Some traditional players are still taking a wait-and-see approach, cautiously observing market infrastructure and regulatory signals before committing capital at scale. On the other hand, firms like BlackRock, Fidelity and Citadel are entering the DeFi space. Institutional adoption is unlocking portfolio diversification, enhanced market efficiency and a more structured approach to risk management, all pointing to a more robust financial ecosystem. Conclusion The institutionalization of digital assets and its convergence with traditional financial systems is not a passing trend, but a structural realignment of markets. Forward-looking institutions are not just participating, they’re supporting the emerging ecosystem. For CIOs and allocators, this convergence presents an inflection point. The ability to navigate digital assets with TradFi discipline and DeFi innovation is becoming a key differentiator — placing emphasis on the importance of partnering with firms who have deep experience across both markets. As the financial landscape evolves, institutions that stay informed and insightful will find themselves positioned to adapt and thrive.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-indices/2025/06/03/the-convergence-of-tradfi-and-digital-asset-markets-a-maturing-ecosystem,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","CoinDesk Indices|Institutional Adoption|TradFi|bitcoin spot ETF|Institutional Investment|Crypto Long & Short|CoinDesk Indices|Opinion|Opinion",cryptocompare

2025-06-04T15:24:08,"Is the Stage Set for a Major Rise in Bitcoin? Swiss Giant Bank Announced!","As Bitcoin (BTC) gradually approaches its previous ATH of $111,000, the overall uptrend is expected to continue. At this point, one of those who expected the rise to continue was the giant Swiss bank Sygnum Bank. Accordingly, Sygnum Bank noted in its June report that institutional interest in Bitcoin is increasing. Bitcoin's circulating supply is shrinking rapidly, paving the way for potential price increases as demand continues to rise, banking analysts said. It was stated that the main reason for the decrease in supply is the increasing institutional demand and the expansion of Bitcoin acquisition vehicles such as ETFs and corporate treasury strategies. Noting that since late 2023, Bitcoin balances on exchanges have decreased by approximately 1 million BTC, analysts argued that this situation is considered positive for the BTC price. “Over the past 18 months, Bitcoin’s liquidity has decreased by 30% due to expanding institutional adoption and the emergence of investment products. Bitcoin's rapidly shrinking liquid supply creates the conditions for demand shocks and upward volatility.” The giant bank also said that Bitcoin statements made by global government organizations also strengthened the outlook. Recently, three US states passed bills allowing for strategic Bitcoin reserves, while a few countries, such as Pakistan, have also announced that they are considering BTC reserves. At this point, Sygnum said, “Official purchases have not started yet, even the news has a positive effect on BTC. If purchases start, it will be a very important catalyst for price increase as well as increasing demand.” Sygnum analysts recently stated that they expect more upside in Bitcoin, saying, “In the past, Bitcoin carried a greater downside risk, but now the upside potential is stronger.” *This is not investment advice.

Half the funding comes from an existing equity facility, while the other $50 million stems from an institutional partnership, according to a press release . The company isn't just focusing on just one digital asset, like many other firms are, but said it will buy cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin BTC, ether ETH, and ""regulated"" stablecoins. The funds will help back the company's artificial intelligence-powered consumer analytics platform, which is set to debut later this year, the firm said in the press release. The digital asset treasury move aims to boost balance sheet efficiency and lay the groundwork for future features such as tokenized loyalty programs and crypto-based payments, the firm added. Various firms have, over the last few months, been moving to adopt cryptocurrencies as treasury assets, building on the momentum set by Strategy, Metaplanet, and others. These firms include K Wave Media, the first Korean media alliance listed on Nasdaq, which announced plans to raise up to $500 million to fund BTC purchases , as well as Classover Holdings, an education firm that’s looking to make a similar bet on SOL.
