The XVG price may reach a potential high of about $0.34 in 2025. The future growth prospects of XVG tokens are heavily dependent on the specific project developments, market dynamics, and the broader crypto market’s trend. The Verge (XVG) token has continued to prioritize user privacy and fast transactions in the past decade of its existence. The open-source project secured through a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism has, however, faced intense competition in recent years from emerging layer one (L1) chains offering more intrinsic features to the users. Nevertheless, the Verge network offers a privacy-focused transaction, with cheap prices, which is heavily associated with widespread adoption by speculative crypto traders. If the Verge team secures successful partnerships and adopts smart contract functionality in the near future, XVG price will continue to record bullish sentiment.

The crypto payment bill is now under review by the state Senate. The bill requires the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) to submit a report to the Legislature on or before January 1, 2028. The report should contain the number and value of cryptocurrency transactions processed, the technical and regulatory challenges encountered, and recommendations for payments under other laws and to other state government agencies to be made using digital financial assets. According to official documents, the bill will sunset on July 1, 2031. Crypto payment bill aims to modernize state payment solutions 🇺🇸 JUST IN: California Assembly passes bill to allow the state to receive payments in Bitcoin and digital currencies. It passed 68-0, and now heads to the Senate. pic.twitter.com/3JWXlpuEWh — Bitcoin Laws (@Bitcoin_Laws) June 3, 2025 The legislation establishes the Digital Financial Assets Law (DFAL), which is a licensing and regulatory framework administered by the DFPI for digital financial asset activity. The bill also prohibits an individual from engaging in digital financial asset business activity without a license from DFPI on or after July 1, 2025. Member of the State Assembly Avelino Valencia, who presented the bill, acknowledged that it was a first-of-its-kind initiative. He noted that the AB 1180 bill would establish a pilot program authorizing the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) to allow for the payment of fees using digital finance assets. “Very excited about this. Having gone to school at San Jose State during the time that this technology was being created, I firmly believe this will be fully integrated into our society in the near future.” – Avelino Valencia , Member of the California State Assembly. Valencia championed the initiative, emphasizing its strategic importance in modernizing payment systems. Bitcoin advocate and political strategist Dennis Porter welcomed the Assembly’s move as a significant milestone in cryptocurrency acceptance in government transactions. Valencia noted that AB 1180 requires a licensee to maintain specific records related to digital financial asset business activity with a California resident for five years after the date of the transaction. It also prohibits a covered person from exchanging, transferring, or storing a stablecoin or engaging in digital financial asset administration unless the issuer of the stablecoin is a licensee, a person who applies for a license, a bank, or a California or federal trust. The legislation also provides that specified sections of the DFAL related to disclosures, consumer protections, and stablecoin requirements will be operative on July 1, 2025. According to Valencia, AB 1180 will ensure that the process and challenges of paying state fees with cryptocurrencies can be studied and improved upon. He also expects the bill to keep pace with evolving consumer preferences since Colorado, Utah, and Louisiana already accept crypto payments. Legislation faces hurdles in converting crypto to fiat We are getting a payment provider to accept crypto equivalent and deposit the dollars into the state’s treasury for that amount. It is kind of like credit card payments, with the bonus that there are no returned payments! pic.twitter.com/H8MaFV1ojE — Governor Jared Polis (@GovofCO) February 23, 2022 The California Blockchain Advocacy Coalition argued that all states accepting cryptocurrency convert it into dollars using a payment processor, which adds additional charges. The coalition noted that Colorado uses PayPal payment processing, which charges a $1 service fee to convert crypto into dollars, plus 1.83% of the payment amount, and requires the use of PayPal Currency Hub. The trade association noted that the State of California is not set up to accept digital asset payments. It also acknowledged that there is no mechanism to convert cryptocurrency payments to dollars, which is the basis of the state budget. Previous legislation allowing the use of cryptocurrency for state payments failed. The bill includes AB 953, which requires the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration to accept stablecoins for tax payments from licensed cannabis businesses. The legislation was referred to Assembly Banking and Finance and Revenue and Taxation but was gut and amended related to land use. The AB 3090 bill requires the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration to issue and deliver to the Legislature a report on how the state, cities, and counties could receive any cannabis tax amounts through stablecoin transactions but failed to go through. SB 1275 also authorizes a state agency to accept digital assets as a payment method to provide government services. The legislation failed to pass out of the Senate.

2025-06-04T06:13:18,"Will XRP Dominate 2025? Recent Shocking Ripple Price Predictions","TL;DR Ripple’s native token has underperformed over the past few weeks, dropping below a crucial support zone of around $2.3, which has now become resistance. However, this hasn’t deterred some of the most vocal members of the XRP Army from setting out big, and perhaps outrageously sounding, price predictions. Here are some of them. Moonshot Not Far Away? Citing their own forecasts based on the Fibonacci pattern, CryptoBilbuwoo0 noted that the day when XRP heads to the moon is “not far away.” The analyst also noted XRP’s previous performance when the asset peaked at around $3.3, which was inches away from the 2018 all-time high, and posted the next targets. They range from more modest $4.29 and $6.78 to some quite bullish of around $26.6-$28.8 and go all the way into the land of insanity – $589 and $1458.3. While we are still on the island of massive price predictions, which would require a mindblowing surge and outplacing heavyweights like BTC, Apple, Amazon, and many others, here’s another example. JackTheRippler, among the biggest XRP bulls, outlined a rumor that the GENIUS stablecoin act can somehow take the token’s price to $250. How will that happen remains undisclosed; perhaps it’s somehow related to Ripple’s own stablecoin (RLUSD), but we will have to wait and see. BarriC also headed to the same island, saying that $10 is just the beginning of an explosive price action. Moreover, the analyst put a slightly bigger target for Ripple’s coin that contains two more zeros at the end. $XRP to $10 is just the beginning of the explosive price action we will see for #XRP $XRP to $1,000 is where $XRP is heading in the near future — BarriC (@B_arri_C) June 3, 2025 Some of these targets might sound outrageous, to say the least, given the necessary market cap growth XRP has to experience to reach a token price of $10, $100, or even $1,000. Just for instance, its market cap would need to explode to around $500 billion if XRP taps $10, given today’s circulation, and you can do your calculations for the other targets. This would make it a lot bigger than ETH. Here’s what ChatGPT thinks about the viability of XRP surging to such heights. XRP to Dominate 2025 XRP DRAGON was also bullish on the asset’s future price trajectory, indicating that people have “a few days left to accumulate XRP at cheap price of $2-$2.3.” After that, Ripple’s token will “dominate this year,” and they exemplified it with a big green prediction candle. $XRP will dominate this year That gives everyone a few days left to accumulate #XRP at the cheap price of $2-$2.30 Once we get to the second week of June 2025 we will experience the beginning of the biggest alt season anyone has ever seen That’s when we see the next god… pic.twitter.com/mDCAYjBcv2 — XRP DRAGON (@DRAGON_XRP66) June 4, 2025 After posting all of these massive price predictions, it is essential to note that they are nothing more than just that – merely predictions. We are not saying they are impossible, as the crypto market has seen some wild things in the past, but investors should conduct their own thorough research and not rely blindly on online forecasts.

2025-06-04T06:07:44,"Is Elon Musk Buying More Bitcoin?","The post Is Elon Musk Buying More Bitcoin? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Elon Musk’s fiery reaction to a controversial Republican-backed spending bill has reignited speculation that Tesla may increase its Bitcoin holdings. His comment comes shortly after Trump gave Musk a public Oval Office send-off, ending his role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) . The bill, which proposes massive tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy, is expected to add $3.8 trillion to the U.S. national debt over the next decade. XRP advocate John Deaton believes this economic direction could encourage Musk and Tesla to adopt Bitcoin further. Elon and Tesla already hold 11,509k BTC; based on Deaton’s prediction, they could add more BTC as a hedge against government spending. Wouldn’t be surprised to see Elon and Tesla buy more Bitcoin. The Big Beautiful Bill is a walking billboard and advertisement for buying Bitcoin. https://t.co/29mGiAptR4 — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) June 3, 2025 A Billboard for Bitcoin? Deaton, who has previously taken on crypto-skeptic lawmakers like Senator Elizabeth Warren, didn’t mince words. He called the bill a “walking advertisement for Bitcoin,” implying that continued inflation and reckless fiscal policies could make decentralized assets more attractive to institutions like Tesla. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Elon Musk Slams ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ as a Path to U.S. Bankruptcy , Musk himself didn’t hold back, labeling the bill a “disgusting abomination.” Senator Rand Paul also agreed with Elon Musk, highlighting concerns about an additional $5 trillion in debt and wasteful government spending. Though the bill still faces significant hurdles in the Senate, its potential to worsen inflation has raised alarm bells even among traditional economists. Notably, gold advocate Peter Schiff warned the bill would drive inflation higher by deepening deficits and weakening the dollar. Thank you Elon. You are absolutely right. I really appreciate your calling attention to this fraud. Hopefully you can influence the President to veto the bill if it passes the Senate in its current form, or anything close to it. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) June 3, 2025 Adding to that, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene raised an issue about a provision, apparently on pages 278-279 of the bill, that would prevent states from regulating Artificial Intelligence (AI) for 10 years. She’s concerned this infringes on states’ rights and gives too much control over AI to the federal government, especially when the full capabilities of AI aren’t yet understood. Tesla’s Bitcoin History Tesla first made headlines with a $1.5 billion Bitcoin investment in 2021. While the company has sold portions of that stash, it still holds approximately $1.2 billion in BTC, according to Arkham Intelligence . Musk hasn’t hinted directly at new purchases, but with inflation concerns mounting and fiat skepticism growing, analysts say the door is open for Tesla to reload. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-04T06:04:09,"Truth Social Bitcoin ETF Filing Submitted to the SEC","The ETF will track Bitcoin’s price and be listed on NYSE Arca. Meanwhile, US Senator Cynthia Lummis revealed that several military leaders, particularly in Southeast Asia, support building a national Bitcoin reserve to counter China in ongoing economic warfare. Adding to the positive sentiment surrounding Bitcoin, miner Cango announced it mined 954.5 BTC in April and May—worth over $100 million—after fully shifting from its legacy business to mining. The firm also struck a $70 million share deal that could hand voting control to Enduring Wealth Capital. Truth Social Bitcoin ETF Joins the Race Donald Trump’s involvement in the cryptocurrency sector took another bold step with the filing of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) branded with his social media platform, Truth Social. On June 3, NYSE Arca submitted a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on behalf of crypto asset manager Yorkville America Digital, a partner of Trump Media & Technology Group, which owns Truth Social. Although Trump transferred ownership of the media group to a trust controlled by his son, Donald Trump Jr., he is still its majority owner. The proposed ETF seeks to track the price of Bitcoin and will be listed on NYSE Arca, with Foris DAX Trust Company—custodian of Crypto.com’s assets—named as the intended custodian. Key details like the fund's ticker and management fee were not shared. If approved, the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF will enter an increasingly competitive landscape that is currently dominated by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). The move is seen as further intertwining Trump’s brand with the crypto sector, which already includes several non-fungible token (NFT) projects, a stablecoin, multiple meme coins, a mining firm, and a tokenized crypto platform. Critics argue that ventures like these raise questions about conflicts of interest with Trump’s political role. The ETF application follows an April agreement between Trump Media, Yorkville, and Crypto.com to roll out a range of “Made in America” crypto ETFs. The new filing triggers the SEC’s formal review process, which gives the agency 45 days to respond with an approval, rejection, or delay. However, the review period can be extended for up to 240 days, setting a final deadline of Jan. 29, 2026. Yorkville must also submit an S-1 registration statement with details about how the ETF will function as well as risks to investors. This is not Trump Media’s first attempt to enter the ETF space. The company previously filed for a “Truth.Fi Bitcoin Plus ETF” in February, and allocated up to $250 million to its fintech platform Truth.Fi . Beyond ETFs, the firm also plans to integrate crypto into its digital ecosystem. CEO Devin Nunes revealed in April that Trump Media is working on a crypto wallet and utility token for its video streaming site, Truth+, which will allow users to pay for subscriptions and other services on the platform. US Military Leaders Back Bitcoin Reserve The deepening ties between the crypto space and US leadership became even more clear after Senator Cynthia Lummis recently revealed that certain factions in the American military are in favor of creating a national Bitcoin reserve. They see it as a crucial strategic asset in the face of rising economic and geopolitical tensions. In a June 3 interview with Bloomberg, Lummis shared that some US generals—particularly those stationed in Southeast Asia—have expressed strong support for Bitcoin as a form of economic defense in the increasingly volatile global landscape. According to Lummis, these military leaders believe that Bitcoin could play a pivotal role in strengthening America’s position in what she referred to as “economic war” with China, She also believes that preparation for traditional military conflict should go hand-in-hand with readiness in the digital and financial arenas. “There are generals, especially in Southeast Asia, who believe it’s important to have a strategic Bitcoin stockpile because we’re doing an economic war with China and we have to prepare for a guns and bullets war. But we need both,” Lummis stated during the interview. Her comments reflect the growing belief among some US policymakers and defense strategists that Bitcoin and other decentralized technologies may become essential tools in the modern geopolitical toolkit. This discussion happened amid heightened scrutiny of the US-China relationship, which has been riddled by trade wars, tech competition, and diverging policies on digital assets. While the US is increasingly warming up to Bitcoin as part of its economic strategy, China enforced a strict ban on all cryptocurrency-related activities since 2021. Despite this, China continues to invest heavily in blockchain innovation through its central bank digital currency, the digital yuan. President Donald Trump clearly declared his ambition to make the US the “ world capital of crypto ,” and also pointed out that failure to lead could result in China overtaking the space. US Vice President JD Vance spoke at Bitcoin 2025, and also spoke about the idea that America’s dominance in the crypto sector is key to its future competitiveness on the global stage. Vice President JD Vance speaking at Bitcoin 2025 Bitcoin Miner Cango Reports Massive Production Surge In other Bitcoin-related news, mining firm Cango reported a big boost in production after fully pivoting to crypto mining. In fact, the firm generated almost $100.5 million worth of Bitcoin in just two months. According to a June 3 announcement , the company mined a total of 954.5 BTC during April and May, with 470 BTC mined in April and 484.5 BTC in May. This production surge happened after Cango’s decision in early April to sell off its legacy operations in China to an entity linked to mining giant Bitmain, which started its complete strategic shift toward Bitcoin mining. Announcement from Cango The company has been rapidly scaling up its mining capabilities, operating at an average hashrate of almost 30 exahashes per second across April and May. In Bitcoin mining, hashrate represents the number of cryptographic computations a miner can perform each second. It is essentially the number of “guesses” it can make to find a valid block hash. A higher hashrate increases the chances of successfully validating a block and earning the Bitcoin reward under the network’s proof-of-work consensus mechanism. This recent mining output comes on the heels of a strong first quarter , during which Cango reported having mined 1,541 BTC, worth approximately $162 million at the time. The company’s focus on scaling its hashrate seems to be paying off. Additionally, Cango’s co-founders, Xiaojun Zhang and Jiayuan Lin, agreed to sell 10 million of their high-vote Class B shares to Enduring Wealth Capital for $70 million, pending shareholder approval. These shares carry 20 votes each, and will retain their voting power, while the founders plan to convert their remaining Class B shares to standard one-vote Class A stock. If the deal goes through, Enduring Wealth Capital will assume voting control of the company with over half the total votes. However, the firm will hold less than 5% of the company’s economic equity, or under 37% in the event Cango issues additional stock tied to mining rig acquisitions.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9422/truth-social-bitcoin-etf-filing-submitted-to-the-sec,"ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|REGULATION","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-06-04T06:00:18,"Bitcoin Derivatives Reset: Neutral Funding And Whale Withdrawals Hint At Bullish Shift","As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to hover near its all-time high (ATH) of $111,814, signs of a reset in the derivatives market are emerging. One such indicator is the Binance Liquidation Delta, which is showing a consistent pattern of large-scale long position liquidations. Bitcoin Late-Long Positions Get Wiped Out According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by analyst Amr Taha, Binance’s BTC derivatives market is currently experiencing a significant reset. The Binance Liquidation Delta reveals that liquidations of long positions, sometimes exceeding $40 million, are repeatedly disrupting the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Selling Pressure Weak As Binance Inflows Stay Subdued – Can BTC Sustain Its Rally? For the uninitiated, the Binance Liquidation Delta measures the difference between long and short liquidations on Binance’s futures market. A negative delta means more long positions are being forcibly closed, often indicating bearish pressure or a leverage reset. On the contrary, a positive delta suggests more short positions are getting liquidated, which can signal a bullish short squeeze. The following chart highlights repeated spikes in long liquidations – shown in green – occurring at hourly intervals. While some short liquidations are also present, they are far less significant in magnitude. Taha noted a key detail that despite the consistent flushing of long positions, funding rates on Binance remain neutral, hovering around zero. This indicates a lack of extreme sentiment – neither overly bullish nor bearish – implying that traders are cautiously reassessing their positions rather than panicking. In parallel, whale activity signals accumulation rather than capitulation. Most notably, Bitfinex saw its largest single-day BTC withdrawal since August 2019, as 20,000 BTC was pulled from the exchange. Taha commented: This transaction, valued at over $1.3 billion based on current prices, indicates that such large-scale withdrawals often reflect long-term holding strategies, thereby alleviating immediate selling pressure on exchanges. Considering the neutral funding environment, persistent long liquidations, and substantial whale outflows, the analyst suggested that Bitcoin may be positioning for another upward move – potentially to a new ATH. New ATH On The Horizon For BTC? At the time of writing, BTC is trading 5.8% below its ATH. However, several technical and on-chain indicators hint at further upside for the world’s largest digital asset by market cap. Related Reading: Bitcoin Surges With Low Retail Interest – Is A Second Wave Coming? For instance, CryptoQuant contributor ibrahimcosar recently projected a price target of $112,000 following a bullish double bottom breakout. Additionally, Coinbase recently recorded a 7,883 BTC withdrawal, suggesting that institutional investors may be positioning for the next leg up. That said, some warning signs persist. For example, recent on-chain data shows that long-term BTC holders are reducing their exposure to the digital asset, likely in anticipation of a price correction. At press time, BTC trades at $105,308, up 1.4% in the past 24 hours.

2025-06-04T05:54:21,"Week in GameFi: Markets Slump, Wynn Liquidated, but Bright Spots Remain","The Web3 gaming sector took a hit this week as bearish momentum swept through the broader crypto market. GameFi saw its total market capitalization tumble by 13%, accompanied by a 21% drop in trading volume. With Bitcoin pulling back to around $106,000 and sentiment turning cautious, several high-profile events sent shockwaves through the ecosystem — none more dramatic than the $100 million liquidation of prominent investor James Wynn. A handful of high-profile projects managing to keep some semblance of forward momentum, sometimes even growing and expanding, in this market is surprising to see. From a recent unexpected rise by Undeads Games (UDS) right on down to a big Sony blockchain integration, GameFi remains a space full of excitement and tension. Bearish Winds Hit GameFi Hard The sell-off in GameFi closely tracked the price dip in Bitcoin. As the price of Bitcoin slipped, so did the values assigned to digital collectibles and other assets within the GameFi universe. Ironically, even as GameStop announced its acquisition of 4,710 BTC, the market didn’t pay much attention and continued its downward trajectory. Meanwhile, the story circulated about James Wynn’s $100 million position in Bitcoin that had been heavily margined, or on leverage. When Wynn’s liquidation hit the news, it appeared to confirm the skeptics’ thesis about the ongoing underdevelopment of the GameFi sector. As risk hunger diminished, industry-wide red ink ensued. Activity in trading ground to a slow pace, and all eyes diverted back toward secure assets amid an ever-growing uncertainty bubble. The latest downturn for GameFi isn’t solely the result of some sins committed within. It’s also riding the wave of an altcoin dip — one that’s so bad, the Altcoin Season Index dropped from 28 to 22. That means Bitcoin is now, more than ever, in the driver’s seat for market direction. GameFi’s ascension to the 13th position on DeFiLlama’s protocol tracker may look like advancement, but it is not. This move up the charts occurred less from GameFi’s organic growth and more because other sectors of the crypto world fell even harder. In short, GameFi’s relative position improved. However, the fundamentals of GameFi didn’t get any better. Undeads Games Shocks Market With +75% Surge A handful of projects managed to stay in the latest bear market. Undeads Games (UDS), was the clear standout with a wild uptick of 75.51%. What was driving demand for UDS? Speculation and a monster upcoming beta launch in January. Add to this fearless trading activity and investors eyeing the possible value of an upcoming airdrop and you remind the market that GameFi has both speculative and enduring growth potential. UDS wasn’t solitary in defying the trend. MYRIA similarly attracted attention with a 40.29% increase, spurred on by engagement from the community and fresh developments in the ecosystem. At the same time, MASK maintained its ascent with a 15.13% rise , marking off yet another week in the green and gaining traction among play-to-earn aficionados. These individual victories, though commendable, hardly made a dent in the overall decline. The majority of GameFi tokens continued to struggle, and many low-cap projects couldn’t seem to attract any attention at all in this trading strategy environment. Right now, GameFi seems to be clustering together a series of quite rare successes. Week in GameFi: Hard To Wynn as Bears Bring Down Market. GameFi tanks 13% as BTC cools off! Wynn gets liquidated for $100M! UDS defies gravity with a 75% rally! Sleepagotchi taps Sony’s blockchain! Let’s unpack this week’s Web3 gaming shake-up 1/6 pic.twitter.com/0nJOsdoAgW — CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) June 2, 2025 Sony Partnership Boosts Sleepagotchi’s Reach One of the week’s most hopeful developments came from the Sleep-to-Earn sector, where Sleepagotchi disclosed an important integration with Sony’s blockchain platform, Soneium. The lite version of Sleepagotchi has officially launched on Line, tapping into an enormous user base of over 200 million people. This partnership isn’t just about distribution — it’s also about ecosystem evolution. Users on Line now have early access to a new points system tied to the upcoming Sleepagotchi 2.0 app. This kind of infrastructure-level integration with a global tech giant like Sony signals a maturation of the Web3 gaming narrative. It also provides a fresh use case for blockchain in wellness and gamified lifestyle apps, sectors that continue to draw both attention and innovation. The partnership might signify a pivotal moment for GameFi’s aspirations to go mainstream. As established technology and social media companies explore decentralized ecosystems, projects that serve a demonstrable real-world purpose — as opposed to simply being the next hot speculative thing — tend to have a thriving outlook. GameFi is not a currently thriving ecosystem, especially since the top play-to-earn project, Axie Infinity, has become an example more of what not to do than what to emulate. Final Thoughts: Reminding that GameFi is still a very volatile, high-stakes arena, this past week saw a push-back against the overall market that had previously seemed to be moving toward a recovery. Even as sentiment tilted decidedly bearish, nevertheless, some individual stories still managed to find their way toward being upbeat. UDS, for instance— previously a deeply obscure project— saw its tokens rally this week; and Sleepagotchi was busy integrating with Sony. What these individual success stories mostly illustrate, though, is the current fragility of the GameFi sector. It’s hard to see sustainable recovery unless and until Bitcoin finds true price stability and the whole altcoin confidence thing returns. Until then, a handful of GameFi tokens still seem to be getting pumped. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

2025-06-04T05:50:36,"Bitcoin ETF: Truth Social Files for Strategic Spot Offering","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin ETF: Truth Social Files for Strategic Spot Offering In a move that’s certainly raising eyebrows across both the financial and social media landscapes, Truth Social, the platform established by Trump Media & Technology Group, has officially filed documents proposing the listing and trading of a spot Bitcoin ETF . This development, initially reported by Unfolded via X, signals a potentially significant step for the company and offers a fascinating twist in the ongoing story of cryptocurrency adoption. What’s Behind the Headline? Truth Social’s Dive into the Bitcoin ETF Space The core of the news is the filing itself. While details are still emerging, the filing indicates Truth Social’s intention to bring a managed Spot Bitcoin ETF to market. For those unfamiliar, Truth Social launched in 2022, positioning itself as a platform for free expression, primarily associated with former President Donald Trump and his supporters. Its parent company, Trump Media , has recently been in the news following its public listing. But why would a social media company venture into the complex world of financial products like a Crypto ETF ? Several potential motivations could be at play: Business Diversification: Expanding revenue streams beyond advertising or subscription models. Tapping into User Base Interest: Many individuals interested in alternative platforms may also have an affinity for alternative assets like Bitcoin. Leveraging Brand Recognition: Capitalizing on the public profile of Trump Media and its associated figures to attract investment. Strategic Positioning: Aligning the company with emerging financial technology and digital assets. This filing positions Truth Social not just as a media company but potentially as a player in the digital asset investment arena, a pivot that few would have anticipated. Understanding the Significance: Why a Spot Bitcoin ETF Matters The term “ Spot Bitcoin ETF ” has been a hot topic in finance for years, especially after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finally approved several such funds earlier in 2024. Here’s a quick breakdown of why they are important: A Spot Bitcoin ETF holds actual Bitcoin as its underlying asset. This is different from futures-based ETFs, which track the price of Bitcoin futures contracts. Key advantages of a Spot Bitcoin ETF include: Accessibility: Allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements through traditional brokerage accounts, without needing to buy, store, or secure Bitcoin directly. Simplicity: Integrates Bitcoin investment into existing investment frameworks like IRAs or 401(k)s. Regulatory Oversight: ETFs are regulated financial products, offering a layer of investor protection not always present when dealing directly with crypto exchanges. Liquidity: ETFs trade on major stock exchanges, generally offering high liquidity. The approval of the first batch of Spot Bitcoin ETF s was seen as a watershed moment for mainstream crypto adoption. Now, new players like Truth Social potentially entering the fray adds another layer to this evolving market. The Road Ahead: Navigating Regulatory Hurdles for the Crypto ETF Filing for a Bitcoin ETF is just the first step in a potentially long and complex process. The proposal must undergo scrutiny and approval by the SEC. The SEC’s primary mandate is investor protection, and they evaluate ETF proposals based on several factors, including: Market Surveillance Sharing Agreements: Ensuring mechanisms are in place to prevent market manipulation. Custody Arrangements: How the underlying Bitcoin will be securely stored. Valuation Methodologies: How the ETF’s net asset value will be accurately calculated. Liquidity and Redemption Mechanisms: How investors can buy and sell shares and how the fund handles creations and redemptions. While the SEC has approved spot Bitcoin ETFs from established financial institutions, a filing from a social media company like Trump Media presents a novel situation. The regulatory path may involve detailed questions about the company’s financial stability, operational capacity to manage a financial product, and how it plans to meet the stringent requirements for listing and trading. The success of this proposal is far from guaranteed and will depend heavily on Truth Social’s ability to demonstrate to the SEC that they can safely and effectively manage such a fund, adhering to all necessary regulations. Potential Benefits: What Could This Spot Bitcoin ETF Offer? If approved, a Truth Social-managed Spot Bitcoin ETF could offer several potential benefits: For Investors: Provides another accessible avenue for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin, potentially with a different fee structure or marketing approach than existing ETFs. It adds to the competitive landscape, which can sometimes lead to better terms for investors. For Truth Social/Trump Media: Could open up a significant new revenue stream through management fees. It would also raise the profile of the company within the financial sector and among the cryptocurrency community. This could attract a different class of investor to Trump Media itself. For the Bitcoin Market: While the impact of a single new ETF filing is less dramatic now that several are already approved, it still represents continued institutional interest and validation for Bitcoin as an asset class. More ETFs mean more potential capital flowing into the market. The unique branding associated with Trump Media could potentially attract a specific segment of investors who align with the company’s values or simply seek diversification among ETF providers. Potential Challenges: The Obstacles Facing the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF Despite the potential benefits, the path to launching a Truth Social Bitcoin ETF is fraught with challenges: Regulatory Hurdles: As mentioned, SEC approval is not automatic. The company must prove it meets all regulatory requirements, which can be demanding for a non-traditional financial entity. Market Competition: The Spot Bitcoin ETF market is already competitive, with established financial giants like BlackRock, Fidelity, and others already operating funds. Truth Social would need to differentiate its offering. Operational Complexity: Managing an ETF requires specialized expertise in portfolio management, custody, compliance, and distribution, which differs significantly from running a social media platform. Association Risk: The strong political association of Trump Media could be a double-edged sword, attracting some investors while potentially alienating others. This could impact the fund’s ability to attract a broad investor base. Execution Risk: Successfully launching and managing a financial product is different from running a media business. There’s a risk that the company may lack the necessary experience or infrastructure. These challenges mean that the filing is just the beginning, and significant work and approvals would be required for this Crypto ETF to become a reality. Comparing the Landscape: How Does This Fit Among Other Bitcoin ETFs? Since January 2024, the US market has seen the launch of several spot Bitcoin ETF s. These funds have accumulated billions in assets under management and trade actively on exchanges. The existing players are primarily large, experienced asset managers. A Truth Social Bitcoin ETF would enter a market that is already establishing its leaders. Its success would likely depend on factors beyond just offering Bitcoin exposure, such as: Management fees compared to competitors. Marketing and distribution strategy. The level of trust investors place in Trump Media as a financial product provider. It remains to be seen how the market would react to an ETF sponsored by a social media company with a distinct political identity, compared to those offered by traditional financial institutions. Market Implications and Reader Insights: What to Watch For The filing itself is a notable event, indicating the continued mainstreaming of Bitcoin and the diverse range of companies looking to participate in the digital asset space. For readers interested in this development, here are some actionable insights: Track the SEC Filing: Public filings are available, and watching for updates or requests for more information from the SEC will be key. Observe Market Reaction: How does the market react to Trump Media stock (if at all) and the general crypto market sentiment following this news? Compare with Existing ETFs: If the ETF is approved, compare its structure, fees, and performance with the already available Spot Bitcoin ETF s before considering investment. Understand the Sponsor: Research Trump Media ‘s business model and financial health, as the success of the ETF could be indirectly linked to the sponsor’s reputation and stability. This filing underscores that the world of finance and technology is constantly evolving, and unexpected players may enter established markets. Conclusion: The Unfolding Story of Truth Social and the Bitcoin ETF Truth Social’s filing for a Spot Bitcoin ETF is a development that highlights the increasing intersection of technology, media, and decentralized finance. While the path to approval is challenging and the market is competitive, it signifies Trump Media ‘s potential ambition to diversify its business and tap into the growing interest in digital assets. Whether this proposed Crypto ETF will ultimately see the light of day remains to be seen, but the filing itself is a compelling part of the ongoing narrative of Bitcoin’s journey into mainstream finance.

While many new companies have been purchasing Bitcoin in the last two months, a new one is being added to them. Accordingly, the latest news came from Spain, where Spanish coffee chain brand Vanadi Coffee announced that it plans to invest up to 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) in Bitcoin. Stating that it plans to transform into a completely “Bitcoin-focused” company, Vanadi Coffee announced that they are following MicroStrategy's strategy. Vanadi Coffee Chairman Salvador Martí plans to raise funds through a stock issuance and obtain authorization at the board meeting to implement the Bitcoin accumulation plan. Bitcoin plans will be discussed at the upcoming board meeting on June 29, with President Salvador Martí seeking approval for BTC investment “We will propose to the board of directors the issuance of convertible bonds to create a Bitcoin reserve fund.” Led by MicroStrategy, many new companies have recently purchased Bitcoin, with the most buzz being undoubtedly the US gaming giant GamStop.

2025-06-04T05:20:42,"Bitcoin Netflow Turns Negative: A Bullish Sign Amid Short-Term Holder Struggles","Since March 10, 2025, the net flow of Bitcoin—the balance between BTC moving into exchanges and those moving out—has turned negative. This means that on average 3,600 more BTC per day are being taken out of exchanges than are being put into them. Analysts often consider this to be a signal that’s bullish—indicative of greater confidence among BTC holders than there is among BTC non-holders in the longer-term prospects for Bitcoin. Yet the market is more complex, and the situation is more delicate, especially for short-term BTC holders. As it now stands, that’s an unenviable group of people. Understanding Netflow: Why Negative is Bullish Netflow gauges the flow of Bitcoin in and out of exchanges. When the flow of Bitcoin to exchanges is increasing, while the flow of Bitcoin to offline storage is not, then the Bitcoin economy is more likely to be in an increasing selling-pressure situation. Gauging netflow is straightforward. You just measure deposits against withdrawals. They have an explicit Bitcoin money supply implication, which is essentially “You cannot sell what you do not have.” The current net outflow of about -3,600 BTC daily is a significant shift from the prior months and quarters. To put things into context, the peak net outflow in this cycle happened back in December 2022, when a whopping 12,100 BTC per day were moving onto exchanges. Ever since then, this net outflow number has dropped quite a bit, and we now find ourselves in a sustained period of negative net outflow. This movement reflects a change in trader psychology. Instead of offloading their BTC, investors seem to be accumulating or at least holding, which is often viewed as a positive precursor for price appreciation. Starting March 10, 2025, the average Netflow (the difference between BTC deposits to exchanges for selling and BTC withdrawals from exchanges, which count as buying) has moved into negative territory (highlighted in green). In other words, every day about 3.6K more BTC is being… pic.twitter.com/Pfrc8g803r — Axel Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) June 3, 2025 The less BTC available on exchanges, the less immediate selling pressure there is, and that’s something that can help stabilize or even boost Bitcoin’s price in the medium to long term. Short-Term Holders Face Challenges: Underwater and Vulnerable In spite of the good netflow data, traders who have held Bitcoin for less than one month are experiencing losses. Their average purchase price for Bitcoin is almost $104,700, which is a lot higher than the current trading price for the cryptocurrency. Traders in this situation are said to be “underwater,” meaning they are holding onto an asset that is worth a lot less than they paid for it. Short-term $BTC holders (less than a month in) are underwater – average entry was around $104.7K. Now they’re sitting in red, and Realized Price has dropped below zero again. If BTC doesn’t bounce soon, it could trigger some panic selling. This is a zone to watch closely. pic.twitter.com/tsGvaompMw — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) June 2, 2025 This unfavorable sentiment is more amply underscored by the metric known as the realized price, which recently dropped below zero again for this group. The realized price signifies the average price at which coins were last moved on-chain and serves well as a proxy for the average cost basis of the current holders. For the holders of a short duration, a realized price that is now below the market price signifies that a whole lot of them are in a position of loss. This situation can be a dangerous one. For short-term holders, an extended amount of time spent in an underwater position may lead to panic selling if the price does not quickly recover. And if those doing the selling are in a panic, that can certainly put added downward pressure on the price. And by “downward pressure,” I do mean the potential for a price decline or correction. Market analysts closely monitor this situation because they know that short-term holders are the price movers. When the price is going up—say you have token price at 2.5x—that’s when short-term holders are coming in. And when the price is going down, and you have a 75% down from the peak, that’s when your short-term holders are going out. The Road Ahead: Key Levels and Market Sentiment Even though the netflow continues to be negative, we see the holders of Bitcoin as a cautious but optimistic crowd. These are people who aren’t too worried about being off of exchanges and don’t feel that they need to keep their Bitcoin on exchange to feel safe. In fact, this trend combined with an on-exchange supply that is historically low bodes well for the medium-term outlook. The present pressure on short-term holders highlights a fragile equilibrium that the market is maintaining. For Bitcoin, now is the time to find support and perform a bounce-back. If it doesn’t, and if it rather continues the drift of the past week or so, then the risk of a very negative feedback loop that could lead to a further fall in prices looms. That’s because the market seems to be just one more significant price drop away from a look of panic setting in—pushing more holders to do the opposite of what Bitcoin’s name suggests. Bitcoin’s next move might be forecast from an accounting of netflow and the realized price metrics. A continuing negative netflow trend, when prices are stable or improving, could signal the early stages of a healthier, more sustained rally. On the other hand, not maintaining essential support zones could indicate a more difficult stretch coming up, necessitating that investors prepare for heightened volatility and possible price drops. Conclusion Since early March 2025, Bitcoin’s netflow has shifted into negative territory. By contrast, the netflow was positive for much of 2024. In a nutshell, netflow measures whether an asset is coming in or going out of an exchange. In Bitcoin’s case, more currency is moving off exchanges. That’s typically a good sign—much better than the reverse, which is what happened in the last part of 2022 and the first part of 2023, when more Bitcoin was on the way into exchanges. Increased confidence among holders from either of these two scenarios leads to diminished selling pressure. Yet, there are two challenges to this scenario being as rosy as it sounds. The market is moving through this complex scene, and investors and traders are watching closely for any signs of price stabilization or further declines. The next few weeks could be critical in determining whether Bitcoin resumes its trajectory upward or faces renewed selling pressure that looks more like panic than reason. Remaining vigilant with respect to the netflow trends, the realized price data, and the short-term holder behavior of Bitcoin will be pivotal to comprehending the cryptocurrency’s trajectory through 2025.

2025-06-04T05:20:17,"US Stock Market Rallies: Unpacking the Impact on Crypto","BitcoinWorld US Stock Market Rallies: Unpacking the Impact on Crypto The financial world often operates like a complex ecosystem, where movements in one area can send ripples through others. Today, we’re looking at significant upward movement in the US Stock Market , and naturally, many in the crypto community are asking: What does this mean for digital assets? Yesterday saw the three major US Stock Market indexes close the trading session with notable gains. While seemingly separate from the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, the performance of traditional markets, especially key indicators like the S&P 500 , Nasdaq , and Dow Jones , can often provide context or even signal shifts in broader investor sentiment and liquidity that might eventually influence the crypto space. Understanding the Recent US Stock Market Rally Let’s break down the performance of the primary indexes: S&P 500: Gained +0.58% . This index is widely considered a benchmark for the overall health of large-cap US equities, representing 500 leading companies. Its positive movement suggests strength across a broad swathe of the economy. Nasdaq: Rose by +0.81% . Home to many technology and growth stocks, the Nasdaq’s stronger performance often indicates investor appetite for higher-growth, potentially riskier assets within the traditional finance sector. This is particularly interesting for crypto enthusiasts, as tech stocks and crypto sometimes exhibit similar risk-on/risk-off behavior. Dow Jones: Climbed +0.51% . The Dow Jones Industrial Average tracks 30 large, publicly owned companies based in the United States. While less diverse than the S&P 500, its positive close reflects confidence in major industrial and financial sector giants. This coordinated upward movement across the US Stock Market signals a generally positive sentiment among investors in traditional finance right now. But why is this happening? Why the Climb? Factors Driving the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones Several factors could be contributing to this rally in the US Stock Market : Economic Data: Positive economic indicators, such as strong jobs reports, improving consumer confidence, or better-than-expected inflation figures, can boost investor optimism. Corporate Earnings: Strong quarterly earnings reports from major companies, particularly those within the S&P 500 and Nasdaq , demonstrate profitability and future growth potential, attracting investment. Federal Reserve Outlook: Expectations regarding interest rates and monetary policy play a huge role. Hints of potential rate cuts or a pause in hikes can make stocks, especially growth stocks on the Nasdaq , more attractive. Sector Performance: Specific sectors performing well can lift the entire market. For instance, strong performance in technology, financials, or healthcare impacts the S&P 500 and Dow Jones significantly. Understanding these drivers in the traditional market is essential before we explore the potential Crypto Correlation . Exploring the Crypto Correlation: How Does the US Stock Market Influence Digital Assets? The relationship between the US Stock Market and the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), has evolved over time. While initially, crypto was largely uncorrelated with traditional finance, it has shown increasing correlation, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic and the influx of institutional investors. Here’s how the Crypto Correlation often manifests: Risk-On/Risk-Off Sentiment: Both tech stocks (heavy on the Nasdaq ) and cryptocurrencies are often considered ‘risk-on’ assets. When investors are optimistic about the economy and willing to take on more risk, both markets may rally. Conversely, in times of uncertainty or fear (‘risk-off’), both may see sell-offs. Liquidity: A strong stock market can indicate ample liquidity in the financial system. This excess capital might then flow into other asset classes, including cryptocurrencies, as investors seek higher returns. Institutional Adoption: Many institutions investing in crypto also have significant positions in traditional markets. Their asset allocation decisions, influenced by stock market performance and economic outlook, can directly impact crypto investments. Macroeconomic Factors: Shared macroeconomic headwinds or tailwinds (inflation, interest rates, geopolitical events) affect both traditional stocks and crypto, driving parallel movements. While the correlation isn’t perfect and can change, a positive day for the S&P 500 , Nasdaq , and Dow Jones is often viewed by crypto traders as a positive sign for overall market sentiment, potentially paving the way for gains in digital assets as well. Does a Stock Market Rally Guarantee Crypto Gains? Not necessarily. While the Crypto Correlation exists, crypto markets have their own unique drivers: Specific Crypto News: Regulatory developments, technological upgrades (like Ethereum’s Merge), major exchange hacks, or significant adoption news can cause major price swings independent of stock market performance. Market Structure: The 24/7 nature and lower liquidity (compared to stocks) of crypto markets can lead to rapid, volatile movements not seen in traditional markets. Retail vs. Institutional Influence: While institutional money is significant, retail sentiment and viral trends can still have a disproportionate impact on certain cryptocurrencies, especially smaller altcoins. So, while a strong US Stock Market provides a favorable backdrop, crypto investors must also pay close attention to crypto-specific news and market dynamics. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given the increasing Crypto Correlation with the US Stock Market , what can crypto investors do? Monitor Key Indexes: Keep an eye on the performance of the S&P 500 , Nasdaq , and Dow Jones . Significant moves can serve as early indicators of shifts in broader market sentiment. Understand Macro Trends: Pay attention to economic data releases, central bank announcements, and geopolitical events. These factors influence both markets. Assess Risk Appetite: A strong stock market often signals high risk appetite. Consider how this might influence capital flows into riskier assets like crypto. Diversify and Manage Risk: Don’t solely rely on stock market movements to predict crypto. Maintain a diversified portfolio and employ sound risk management strategies based on both macro and crypto-specific analysis. The recent positive close for the US Stock Market indexes – S&P 500 , Nasdaq , and Dow Jones – is a significant event in the traditional finance world. Given the growing Crypto Correlation , it’s a development worth noting for anyone involved in digital assets. While not a direct guarantee of immediate crypto gains, it contributes to a broader picture of investor confidence and liquidity that can create a more favorable environment for risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies. Staying informed about both traditional and crypto markets is key to navigating this interconnected financial landscape.

2025-06-04T05:14:05,"Trump Family Media Group Files for Truth Social Bitcoin ETF","Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) is moving forward with plans to launch a Bitcoin ETF called the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF, according to a June 3 SEC filing. NYSE Group Inc. filed regulatory paperwork to list the product, using the name of President Donald Trump’s social network. The ETF is being developed through a partnership with Yorkville Advisors, a New Jersey-based company that Trump Media describes as an “America-First asset management firm.” It’s really happening. Trump’s company is launching a Bitcoin ETF https://t.co/BQdj9jS98n — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 3, 2025 Another Spot Bitcoin ETF Foris DAX Trust Company will be the custodian of the digital assets, according to the filing, which did not mention the ticker or fees for the new fund. Trump Media had previously applied for trademarks related to Bitcoin investment products that align with the president’s policy priorities. The spot Bitcoin ETF would join more than 60 US funds tied to BTC, though this would buy the asset and track its price like the eleven already approved and trading ETFs. Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said, “On one hand, this is pretty uncharted territory and a huge endorsement of Bitcoin from Trump’s company,” before adding: “But on the other hand, it’s a routine filing in a very crowded category, and it will have its work cut out to attract flows and liquidity.” Critics have raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, given Trump’s dual role in setting cryptocurrency policy while potentially benefiting financially from related businesses. However, the White House has stated that Trump is separated from businesses bearing his name, and he has transferred his Trump Media shares to a trust controlled by his son . Bitcoin Funds Surging American spot Bitcoin ETFs have been wildly successful since their launch 18 months ago and have seen a cumulative $44.4 billion in net inflows so far. Balchunas highlighted that industry-leading BlackRock’s IBIT ETF is the youngest by a long way to enter the top 25 funds. “It’s like an infant hanging out with teenagers and twenty-somethings,” he said. Here’s a table of the Top 25 biggest ETFs and their age. At 1.4 yrs old $IBIT is youngest on list by NINE times. It’s like an infant hanging out with teenagers and twenty-somethings. Quite poss the most insane IBIT stat yet (and there are many) via @SirYappityyapp pic.twitter.com/w63XSkD7f6 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 3, 2025 The analyst also predicted that the BlackRock fund is likely to surpass Satoshi Nakamoto as the world’s biggest Bitcoin holder by the end of next year. This is a “testament to the power of convenience, low cost, liquidity, and trust that the ETF brings to the table,” he said. The eleven spot ETFs in the US were on course to reverse a three-day outflow streak with an inflow of $375 million on June 3, according to preliminary data.

2025-06-04T04:32:24,"Eric Trump Threatens Magic Eden Over Trump Wallet Announcement— What’s Going On?","Magic Eden announced a Trump-branded crypto wallet this week, but the launch drew immediate backlash from the Trump family, showing growing tensions between political branding and crypto ventures. The major NFT marketplace announced Tuesday that it had partnered with the team behind the $ TRUMP meme coin to roll out the “Official $TRUMP Wallet.” The wallet, now available for waitlist sign-ups at TrumpWallet.com , promises users the ability to trade $TRUMP tokens and other cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin . A promotional sweepstakes tied to the launch dangles a $1 million prize pool in $TRUMP rewards. Trump Sons Disavow Crypto Wallet, Warn of Unauthorized Use of Name Eric Trump, however, was quick to reject any affiliation. He stated that the project is not authorized by Trump, and warned Magic Eden to exercise extreme caution when using their name for a venture that hasn’t been approved by anyone within their organization. This project is not authorized by @Trump . @MagicEden I would be extremely careful using our name in a project that has not been approved and is unknown to anyone in our organization. https://t.co/OovJGvGOkO — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) June 3, 2025 “I run @Trump and I know nothing about this project!” he posted on X, tagging the project’s lead partners. His brother, Donald Trump Jr., also denied involvement , adding that the family is working on a separate wallet through World Liberty Financial. However, notably, the Magic Eden wallet announcement was reshared by the official TrumpMeme account on X. Magic Eden didn’t return Cryptonews’ request for comment by press time. The backlash has cast a shadow over what was pitched as a flagship crypto product for Trump supporters. On X, the project’s now-suspended @TrumpWalletApp account had claimed it was “the first and only crypto wallet for true Trump fans.” Magic Eden Aims for Mass Adoption, But Trump Ties Complicate Rollout Magic Eden CEO Jack Lu described the wallet as a step toward bringing more mainstream users into crypto. The product appears to be built on Slingshot Finance, a self-custodial trading app that Magic Eden acquired in April. Slingshot supports popular meme tokens like BONK and FARTCOIN. It does not handle identity verification directly. Instead, that process is delegated to MoonPay, its fiat on-ramp provider. However, several details remain unclear. It is not yet known whether the Trump Wallet will implement its own compliance procedures. Nor is it clear how revenue or responsibilities will be divided among the involved parties. Over the past year, Trump-affiliated entities have steadily expanded their presence in crypto. They launched a Bitcoin mining venture and issued a series of NFTs. In addition, they promoted a stablecoin linked to their ecosystem. More recently, they teased plans for crypto ETFs through TruthFi, the financial arm of Truth Social. In May, Trump hosted a black-tie dinner for top $TRUMP coin holders, blending campaign efforts with crypto fundraising. But the wallet controversy punctuates the blurry line between public branding and private endorsement in the crypto industry. With major political figures now tied to meme coins and wallets, even loosely, the line between official ventures and opportunistic branding has become increasingly consequential.

2025-06-04T04:30:18,"Bitcoin Pauses Below $106K as Analyst Reveals Key Support Level To Watch","Bitcoin’s price is still struggling to regain its upward momentum following the establishment of a new all-time high above $111,000 last week. Today, Bitcoin trades below $106,000 with a current trading price of $105,381, marking a 1.2% increase in the past day and a 5.8% decrease from its peak. The current movement suggests a cooling-off period as traders and analysts monitor for potential market reentry points. Despite the price retreat, the mood across the market remains relatively stable, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index still hovering in the neutral zone. This suggests that the market is yet to enter the euphoric stage typically associated with aggressive buying sprees. While the immediate trend appears sideways, analysts are beginning to highlight certain technical and on-chain signals that may shape Bitcoin’s short-term trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Warning Signs? Long-Term Holders Exit While Retail Buyers Rush In Bitcoin Short-Term Investors Watch $96.7K as Critical Support A recent assessment by an on-chain contributor to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, known as abramchart, identifies $96,700 as a crucial level of interest. This figure aligns with the average acquisition price for short-term holders, making it a potential rebound zone if Bitcoin experiences a further dip. According to the analyst, this support may serve as a trigger point for renewed buying interest should a correction continue to unfold. Additionally, rising Bitcoin dominance is placing pressure on alternative cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum. The analyst notes that corrections in Bitcoin often redirect capital away from altcoins, potentially weakening their short-term performance. In this context, the broader crypto market may experience liquidity fragmentation until Bitcoin reestablishes directional clarity. Abrahchart wrote: If liquidity is available, it is advisable to wait and observe market movements, with the possibility of entering new positions after the anticipated correction completes. Accumulation Activity Suggests Institutional Involvement In a separate insight shared on CryptoQuant, another analyst, Mignolet, highlights a notable relationship between movements in Bitfinex’s Bitcoin reserves and price action. Historically, declining reserves on Bitfinex have often preceded upward trends in Bitcoin’s price, suggesting these outflows may signal increased accumulation. On the latest occasion, around 24,000 BTC were transferred to two wallets, one of which has been officially identified by Bitfinex and Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino as belonging to 21 Capital (XXI), a Tether-backed entity. The second wallet involved in receiving 14,000 BTC was not formally disclosed, but timing and transaction behavior suggest a similar purpose. Unlike earlier transactions often linked to cold storage adjustments, these movements appear to reflect strategic acquisitions. Related Reading: Analyst Suggests Altcoin Recovery May Follow Bitcoin’s Final Cycle Stage—Here’s Why This level of accumulation, particularly by a known Tether-affiliated entity, adds another dimension to Bitcoin’s current price narrative. As institutional players position themselves, retail participants may find additional confirmation of long-term interest in the asset despite short-term fluctuations.
