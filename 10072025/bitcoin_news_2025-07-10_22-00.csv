2025-07-10T19:55:48,"Trader Predicts Mid-Cap Altcoin Could Explode 200%+ by August, Maps Path Forward for Dogecoin and Solana","A closely followed crypto analyst says that one mid-cap altcoin looks primed to quadruple by August while updating his outlook on Dogecoin ( DOGE ) and Solana ( SOL ). In a new strategy session, crypto trader Ali Martinez tells his 139,600 followers on the social media platform X that Pudgy Penguin ( PENGU ), the native asset of a non-fungible token (NFT) collection with the same name, appears ready to skyrocket aided by the launch of its upcoming exchange-traded fund (ETF). ‚ÄúSlap yourself if you are sleeping on PENGU. This is a textbook bullish retest. $0.060 by August is just the start. Once the ETF gets approved, who knows how far this can go.‚Äù Source: Ali Martinez/X PENGU is trading for $0.019 at time of writing, a 31.4% increase during the last 24 hours. A rise to Martinez‚Äôs target would represent a 216% gain for the asset. Moving on to the popular meme asset DOGE, Martinez says that every time it forms a specific pattern, its price tends to rise. The analyst says he envisions the dog-themed digital asset rising to between $0.20 and $0.25. ‚ÄúEvery time Dogecoin forms this pattern, price takes off. Right now, Dogecoin is sitting at the bottom of a parallel channel. A buying spike here could send Dogecoin to $0.20 and maybe even $0.25.‚Äù DOGE is trading for $0.179 at time of writing, a 4% gain on the day. Concluding his analysis with the smart contract platform Solana, Martinez notes that the asset has broken through its resistance zone and is on its way to a price tag of $164 by the end of the week. ‚ÄúSolana is forming a symmetrical triangle, and an 8% move could be next. A close above $153 could send Solana above $164.‚Äù SOL is trading for $156 at time of writing, a 1.6% gain on the day.

2025-07-10T19:51:31,"Strategy‚Äôs tax exposure is a head-on collision with a cash flow gap","For years, Michael‚ÄØSaylor has proudly declared that Strategy would ‚Äúnever sell‚Äù its Bitcoin. That mantra faces a stern test with new taxation laws. Fresh SEC filings and tax rules mean some of the coins in Strategy‚Äôs 597,325‚ÄØBTC (roughly $67‚ÄØbillion at current prices) treasury may have to go. In a July‚ÄØ7 Form‚ÄØ8‚ÄëK , Strategy laid out a new headache: under accounting standard ASU‚ÄØ2023‚Äë08, it must mark its Bitcoin to market each quarter, recording unrealized gains as income. Risk: Tax bills may force BTC sales Strategy writes: ""We may need to liquidate some of our bitcoin holdings or issue additional debt or equity securities to raise cash sufficient to satisfy our tax obligations."" In plain terms: if tax hits, BTC may need to be sold. pic.twitter.com/6ENYrQhhTf ‚Äî CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) July 10, 2025 That boost to paper profits carries a downside. Starting in 2026, the U.S. will slap a 15% Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT) on companies with over $1‚ÄØbillion in adjusted income, potentially crystallizing billions in tax bills on gains the company hasn‚Äôt sold. Strategy once reported Bitcoin at purchase cost, shielding those sky‚Äëhigh gains from its income statement. Now, every uptick in Bitcoin‚Äôs price inflates taxable income, whether the company moves a single coin or not. In practical terms, Saylor‚Äôs empire could face a multi‚Äëbillion‚Äëdollar tax hit, even if its Bitcoin stash stays untouched. A thread on X (formerly Twitter) by analytics firm CryptoQuant, posted Thursday, July 10, 2025, summarized the risk in stark terms. ‚ÄúThe company might owe cash taxes on unrealized BTC gains,‚Äù the firm wrote, adding that Strategy‚Äôs own disclosures admit it may need to liquidate some of its Bitcoin holdings or issue additional debt or equity to meet those obligations. Strategy‚Äôs tax exposure is a head-on collision with a cash flow gap Strategy‚Äôs own filings admit that its software business doesn‚Äôt generate enough cash to cover these new obligations. The company already carries $8.2‚ÄØbillion in convertible debt and $3.4‚ÄØbillion in preferred stock, which together demand well over $350‚ÄØmillion a year in interest and dividends. If cash from operations falls short, Strategy may need to borrow more, tap equity markets, or, contrary to its long‚Äëheld vow, sell Bitcoin. Indeed, the company spells it out unflinchingly: ‚ÄúWe may need to liquidate some of our bitcoin holdings or issue additional debt or equity securities to raise cash sufficient to satisfy our tax obligations.‚Äù This raises a key question: if the company cannot raise new capital through debt or equity issuance, will it be forced to tap into its Bitcoin reserves? Yes, they've sold BTC before. Despite the ‚Äúwe never sell‚Äù meme‚Ä¶ üìâ They sold BTC in Q4 2022 (as disclosed in prior SEC filings). A reminder: nothing is off the table if liquidity is tight. pic.twitter.com/xdiaYOQ0Kr ‚Äî CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) July 10, 2025 Custodial risk is another issue outside Saylor‚Äôs control Strategy acknowledged that even its custodial arrangements for Bitcoin may not be bulletproof. If a custodian fails, they may not be able to access their Bitcoin, as the company warned that its tokens could be treated as part of the custodian‚Äôs estate, effectively rendering Strategy a general unsecured creditor. To its credit, Strategy has been transparent in outlining these threats. ‚ÄúThis is not intended to spread fear, uncertainty, or doubt,‚Äù CryptoQuant wrote in its final post on the topic. ‚ÄúIt simply summarizes what‚Äôs written by Strategy themselves in their official SEC filing.‚Äù Strategy‚Äôs bitcoin holdings represent roughly 3% of the token‚Äôs total circulating supply. Any move under distress, whether to cover taxes or obligations, could considerably impact the market. For now, Strategy remains one of the largest and boldest corporate holders of Bitcoin. But the company‚Äôs own documents suggest that it understands that its Satoshi-centric model, while immensely profitable on paper, is also vulnerable. However, if anyone has the answers to these doubts, it‚Äôs probably Saylor.

2025-07-10T19:39:07,"After Bitcoin's ATH, Smart Money Turns to Avalanche vs. Polkadot: Which Will Outperform in 2025?","Bitcoin's peak has sparked a keen interest in the crypto world. Now, attention is shifting to other promising contenders. Spotlight on Avalanche and Polkadot as they vie for dominance. Explore the potential growth of these two coins and see which might lead the way by 2025. Discover the smart money's next move in the evolving crypto landscape. Avalanche Price Action: Analyzing Past Performance and Current Dynamics Avalanche experienced a 5.38% increase over the last week, yet it faced a significant decline of 10.98% over the past month and a steep 46.75% drop in the past six months. Recent price movements reflect short-term gains amidst persistent bearish pressure, while the longer-term trend indicates a consistent downturn. Despite a few temporary rebounds, the asset's ongoing fluctuations have kept traders on high alert, with the market remaining cautious following substantial losses over an extended period. Currently, Avalanche trades within a range of $14.82 to $21.92. Immediate support is at $11.69, and the nearest resistance is at $25.89, while a secondary support lies at $4.59, with upper resistance at $32.99. The momentum indicator shows a slight upward force at 1.58, although the Awesome Oscillator reads slightly negative at -0.145. With the Relative Strength Index at 55.93, the asset is balanced but not in extreme territory. This situation results in mixed bullish and bearish pressures, prompting traders to watch for breakouts above $25.89 or downturns below $11.69 as they consider their next moves. Polkadot's Price Movements: Analyzing Recent Trends and Opportunities Polkadot experienced a noticeable decline over the past month with prices falling about 11.54% and a steeper drop of 45.32% over six months. Recent moves showed a modest recovery with a 3.66% gain in the past week, highlighting short-term resilience despite the longer-term downtrend. Price volatility has defined its performance, with market sentiment reflected in cautious indicators and occasional positive shifts. Historical price swings underline the challenge of regaining lost strength and pave the way for renewed activity if market dynamics turn favorable. Polkadot currently trades within a narrow band between $2.83 and $4.16, setting a clear stage for tactical maneuvering among market participants. Immediate resistance is spotted at $4.92, which serves as a hurdle that price must clear before a move towards the higher barrier of $6.25 can be considered. Downside protection is anchored by a primary support level of $2.26, with additional safety near $0.93. The current technical indicators offer mixed signals; the Awesome Oscillator is slightly negative at -0.131, while the momentum indicator reads 0.28 and the RSI hovers at 54.47. Bulls and bears are locked in a contest, resulting in an absence of a clear long-term trend. Traders might consider strategies focusing on established boundaries, such as short positions near resistance or buying on dips at support levels when confirmation appears. Conclusion Both AVAX and DOT show strong potential for growth by 2025. AVAX boasts quick transaction speeds and a secure platform. DOT focuses on connecting various blockchains and fostering interoperability. Investors might find AVAX appealing for its efficiency, while DOT‚Äôs strength lies in its ability to connect different systems. Both coins are in a good position for future development and could be key players in the coming years. The choice between AVAX and DOT depends on an investor's preference for speed or connectivity.

2025-07-10T19:33:09,"What's the Next Top for Bitcoin? After Clearing $112k, Analysts Set Their Sights Higher. But When Will the Time for Ethereum, Cardano, and XRP Come?","Bitcoin has broken the $112,000 mark , catching the attention of market analysts. The cryptocurrency is reaching new heights, but Bitcoin is not the only one with potential. Other major players like Ethereum, Cardano, and XRP may be next in line. The article explores which coins could see significant growth soon and what could trigger these changes. Bitcoin Price Analysis: Steady Growth, Defined Levels, and Trading Prospects Bitcoin recorded a 2.06% increase over the past week and a modest 0.80% rise over the last month. Over the six months, growth reached 17.22%, reflecting a steady progression that highlights gradual recovery. Price movements over these periods indicate stable long-term development despite small fluctuations in the short term. Historical performance suggests that the market has maintained a positive direction with incremental gains over varied intervals, indicating a general upward trend during recent months. Current prices hover between $100,193 and $112,335, with the nearest resistance at $117,502 and support at $93,218 offering clear target levels. The secondary resistance of $129,644 and support at $81,076 further define the trading range for Bitcoin. Bulls appear to be pushing prices upward, creating a balanced atmosphere where sideways moves are common. Trading ideas include looking for entries near support levels and steering positions toward the higher resistance while monitoring momentum indicators that are rising alongside an RSI reading of 61.86. This setup favors a cautious but optimistic stance, allowing for well-placed stop losses to protect positions as the market tests defined boundaries. Ethereum Price Trends: Resilience Amid Long-Term Challenges Ethereum recorded a moderate price increase over the last week with a gain of 7.94% and a steady rise of 3.64% over the past month. In contrast, the six-month performance showed a decline of nearly 15%, indicating a period of lower long-term momentum. Short-term price gains hint at investor optimism, yet the longer timeline underscores a divergence between daily rallies and overall downward pressure. The price behavior reflects short-term recovery amid ongoing challenges, revealing volatility with bursts of increased activity against a backdrop of caution. The current price is trading between $2110.94 and $2870.47, with bulls pushing the asset upward near overbought levels. Immediate resistance stands at $3254.35, with a higher hurdle at $4013.88, while supports are found at $1735.29 and further down at $975.76. Technical indicators suggest bullish forces in the short term, despite mixed longer-term sentiments. There is no clear long-term trend; traders are marking the zone between support and resistance for potential entry and exit points. Caution remains key, with opportunities for swing trades around these pivotal levels. Cardano's Volatility: Short-Term Rally Amid Long-Term Decline ADA price experienced a 10.62% dip over the past month following a 7.86% weekly surge, showing mixed market behavior. Over the last six months, Cardano registered a 32.15% decline, signaling a longer-term downward trend despite intermittent recoveries. Weekly gains provided brief optimism while the cumulative six-month performance has been challenging for holders and short-term traders alike. Cardano's price action has been volatile, with fluctuations reflecting a tug-of-war between temporary bullish pushes and overarching bearish pressure. The current price sits within a range of $0.48 to $0.70, with key resistance levels at $0.83 and $1.05 and support at $0.38 and a secondary boundary near $0.163. The relative strength index is at 57.025, indicating moderate buying interest. The momentum indicator at 0.059 and an almost neutral Awesome Oscillator of -0.008 suggest market uncertainty. Bulls show some pressure as prices test higher levels, but bears maintain influence due to the recent downtrend. Traders may consider positions near the support of $0.38 for potential reversals while watching for a break above $0.83 to signal upward momentum. XRP Market Snapshot: Past Gains and Present Key Levels XRP experienced steady gains over the past month with a rise of about 5.66% and maintained modest upward momentum over the last six months with an approximate growth of 4.74%. Price variations have remained within a narrow range as the coin demonstrated resilience during periods of market adjustments. Weekly shifts, such as a near 9.67% increase, indicate that XRP has seen bursts of activity, while its longer-term movement has been more gradual. Data shows a mix of slight surges and consolidations that collectively suggest a stable growth pattern without dramatic volatility. Past performance highlights cautious optimism among traders as XRP steadily rebuilt value over time. The current trading range for XRP falls between $1.99 and $2.41, with first support at $1.73 and resistance at $2.59. Above these, a second support near $1.31 and resistance close to $3.02 further define critical price boundaries. Bulls seem to hold some control as momentum and moving averages suggest a bias toward upward movement, although the summary rating remains neutral. A break above the $2.59 resistance level could spark fresh bullish interest, while a retreat toward the $1.73 support calls for careful short-term action. Trading around these levels offers opportunities; traders could look for entries when prices touch support in anticipation of a bounce while cautiously avoiding overextended moves near resistance. Conclusion Bitcoin has surpassed $112k , and now analysts are looking at even higher targets. As BTC continues its rise, attention will eventually turn to other cryptocurrencies. ETH , ADA , and XRP have shown strong potential and could see significant gains. While Bitcoin sets new records, these coins may soon experience their moment in the spotlight. Timing and market conditions will be crucial for their upcoming growth. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-07-10T19:30:26,"Bitcoin Investment: KULR Technology Group‚Äôs Astounding $10M Acquisition Boosts Crypto Confidence","In a move that has captured the attention of both traditional finance and the cryptocurrency world, NYSE-listed KULR Technology Group recently announced a significant expansion of its Bitcoin (BTC) reserves. This latest KULR Bitcoin acquisition, valued at $10 million, brings the company‚Äôs total holdings to an impressive 1,021 BTC. It‚Äôs a powerful statement from a technology company, signaling a growing trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption that could reshape corporate treasury strategies worldwide. KULR Technology Group‚Äôs Bold Bitcoin Investment Strategy Unveiled KULR Technology Group, a leading developer of thermal management and battery safety solutions, has been quietly building its Bitcoin portfolio, and this latest announcement puts their commitment front and center. According to CEO Michael Mo, who shared the news on X (formerly Twitter), the company‚Äôs total Bitcoin acquisitions now stand at approximately $101 million. This substantial sum underscores a deliberate and long-term Bitcoin investment strategy. The average purchase price for KULR‚Äôs 1,021 BTC is reported at $98,627 per coin. While this figure might seem high compared to Bitcoin‚Äôs current market price, it reflects the company‚Äôs consistent accumulation over time, perhaps indicating a dollar-cost averaging approach. This strategy aims to mitigate the impact of Bitcoin‚Äôs notorious volatility by spreading purchases over a period, rather than trying to time the market. What drives a company like KULR, primarily focused on aerospace and defense, to allocate such a significant portion of its balance sheet to a volatile asset like Bitcoin? The answer lies in a combination of factors: Inflation Hedge: Many corporations view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation, a store of value in an era of quantitative easing and depreciating fiat currencies. Long-Term Value Appreciation: Belief in Bitcoin‚Äôs future as a global digital reserve asset, with potential for substantial long-term price appreciation. Balance Sheet Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset to traditional holdings like cash and bonds can enhance portfolio resilience. Innovation and Forward Thinking: Aligning with cutting-edge technology and demonstrating a progressive stance to investors. Unpacking the Latest KULR Bitcoin Acquisition: What Does it Mean? The addition of another $10 million in Bitcoin is not just a footnote; it‚Äôs a reinforcement of KULR‚Äôs conviction in the digital asset. This move follows a broader trend where publicly traded companies are increasingly exploring the integration of digital assets into their financial frameworks. For KULR, this recent acquisition solidifies its position among the ranks of corporate entities embracing cryptocurrency. Michael Mo‚Äôs public announcement on X is also noteworthy. By using social media to share this significant financial decision, KULR is engaging directly with a wider audience, including the crypto community, which often follows such corporate developments closely. This transparency can build trust and attract a new segment of investors who are enthusiastic about companies with exposure to digital assets. The 1,021 BTC now held by KULR places it in a notable position, though still behind giants like MicroStrategy, which holds over 200,000 BTC. However, KULR‚Äôs consistent accumulation, despite market fluctuations, suggests a deep conviction in Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term value proposition. This is not a speculative short-term play but appears to be a strategic long-term treasury management decision. The Rise of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption: A Growing Trend? KULR‚Äôs actions are part of a much larger narrative: the accelerating pace of institutional Bitcoin adoption. Over the past few years, we‚Äôve witnessed a paradigm shift, with more and more traditional financial institutions and public companies allocating capital to Bitcoin. This trend signifies a maturing market and a growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Consider companies like MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, which has become synonymous with corporate Bitcoin accumulation. Their aggressive strategy has paved the way for others to consider similar moves. Beyond MicroStrategy, other companies such as Tesla, Block (formerly Square), and various investment funds have also added Bitcoin to their balance sheets or offer Bitcoin-related services. This surge in corporate BTC holdings is driven by several factors: Macroeconomic Climate: Concerns about inflation and the devaluation of fiat currencies push companies to seek alternative stores of value. Accessibility: Improved infrastructure for buying, selling, and custody of Bitcoin makes it easier for institutions to participate. Regulatory Clarity (Evolving): While still a work in progress, increasing regulatory discussions and the approval of Bitcoin ETFs in various jurisdictions lend more legitimacy to the asset. Investor Demand: A growing number of investors, particularly younger generations, are interested in companies that embrace digital assets. The entry of more institutions provides liquidity, reduces volatility (in the long run, though short-term volatility remains), and strengthens Bitcoin‚Äôs position in the global financial landscape. Navigating Corporate BTC Holdings: Benefits and Challenges While the allure of Bitcoin is strong, companies like KULR must carefully weigh the benefits against the inherent challenges of holding such a volatile asset. Understanding these aspects is crucial for any firm considering a similar Bitcoin investment strategy. Benefits of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings: Potential for Significant Returns: Bitcoin has historically outperformed many traditional assets, offering substantial upside potential. Diversification: Bitcoin‚Äôs low correlation with traditional assets can help diversify a corporate treasury, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Enhanced Brand Image: Embracing innovative technologies like Bitcoin can position a company as forward-thinking and technologically advanced, appealing to a modern investor base. Inflation Protection: As a decentralized asset with a capped supply, Bitcoin is often seen as a hedge against inflationary pressures. Challenges and Risks of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings: Price Volatility: Bitcoin‚Äôs price can experience dramatic swings, which can impact a company‚Äôs balance sheet and quarterly earnings. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, posing potential risks related to compliance, taxation, and future restrictions. Custody and Security: Securely storing large amounts of Bitcoin requires specialized expertise and robust security measures to prevent hacks or loss. Accounting Treatment: Current accounting rules often require Bitcoin to be treated as an intangible asset, leading to potential impairment charges if its value drops below the purchase price. Public Perception: Some traditional investors might view Bitcoin holdings as overly speculative, potentially affecting investor confidence. KULR‚Äôs management team likely has a sophisticated understanding of these factors, having made multiple acquisitions. Their continued commitment suggests they believe the long-term benefits outweigh the risks. Beyond KULR: Understanding Bitcoin Investment Strategy in the Corporate World KULR‚Äôs strategic move is more than just a company buying Bitcoin; it‚Äôs a bellwether for how corporate treasuries are evolving. This shift is not just about speculation but about adapting to a changing financial world where digital assets play an increasingly prominent role. For investors, understanding the motivations behind such corporate BTC holdings can offer valuable insights. What actionable insights can we glean from KULR‚Äôs actions and the broader trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption? Market Signal: Each corporate acquisition of Bitcoin reinforces its legitimacy as an asset, potentially attracting more traditional capital. Due Diligence: For investors, it becomes increasingly important to understand a company‚Äôs treasury strategy, including its exposure to digital assets. Long-Term Vision: Companies embracing Bitcoin are often doing so with a long-term vision, looking beyond short-term market fluctuations. Diversification of Risk: For individual investors, KULR‚Äôs strategy might inspire a re-evaluation of personal portfolio diversification to include digital assets. The narrative of Bitcoin moving from a niche internet currency to a corporate treasury asset is powerful. As more companies like KULR Technology Group make such bold moves, the line between traditional finance and the crypto economy continues to blur, paving the way for a more integrated financial future. Conclusion: KULR‚Äôs Bold Step in a Shifting Financial Landscape KULR Technology Group‚Äôs recent $10 million Bitcoin acquisition, boosting its corporate BTC holdings to 1,021 BTC, is a significant event that resonates far beyond the company‚Äôs balance sheet. It‚Äôs a clear indicator of growing institutional Bitcoin adoption and a testament to a well-thought-out Bitcoin investment strategy. While the journey of corporate crypto treasuries is still in its early stages, KULR‚Äôs consistent accumulation highlights a belief in Bitcoin‚Äôs enduring value and its potential to serve as a robust asset in a diversified portfolio. This move not only strengthens KULR‚Äôs financial position but also contributes to the broader legitimization of Bitcoin within the global corporate sphere, setting a compelling example for other enterprises to consider.

But just beneath it, altcoins are quietly positioning for a late-summer rotation,‚Äù B2BINPAY analysts stated. ‚ÄúBut if macro shocks hit (a hawkish Fed pivot or geopolitical escalation), Bitcoin could spike in dominance as risk appetite vanishes,‚Äù they added. While Bitcoin remains relatively resilient when it comes to macro shocks, altcoins are much more sensitive. Any development that lowers risk appetite among traders will likely have a major negative effect on the altcoin market.

2025-07-10T19:20:26,"Bitcoin: DDC Enterprise Unveils Colossal $100M Strategy with Animoca Brands","The cryptocurrency landscape is constantly evolving, and a recent development has sent ripples through both the e-commerce and Web3 sectors. NYSE-listed DDC Enterprise , a prominent player in the e-commerce world, has announced a groundbreaking partnership with Web3 gaming giant Animoca Brands . This strategic alliance commits an astounding $100 million towards enhancing DDC‚Äôs Bitcoin holdings, marking a significant step towards mainstream corporate adoption of digital assets. This isn‚Äôt just about buying Bitcoin; it‚Äôs about a meticulously planned Bitcoin strategy designed to optimize corporate treasury management and embrace the future of finance. What Does This Game-Changing Bitcoin Strategy Entail? At its core, this partnership between DDC Enterprise and Animoca Brands is formalized through a memorandum of understanding (MOU). The commitment of up to $100 million is earmarked specifically for increasing DDC‚Äôs Bitcoin (BTC) accumulation. But it goes beyond simple acquisition. The collaboration aims to leverage Animoca Brands‚Äô extensive expertise in the blockchain and digital asset space to develop sophisticated strategies for DDC‚Äôs corporate Bitcoin treasury management. This signifies a move by DDC Enterprise to not only hold Bitcoin but to actively manage it as a strategic asset within its financial framework. This initiative represents a fusion of traditional finance and the burgeoning digital economy. DDC Enterprise, a seasoned e-commerce company, is tapping into the innovative prowess of Animoca Brands, a company synonymous with the cutting edge of Web3 gaming and the metaverse. The synergy is clear: DDC brings its established market presence and financial acumen, while Animoca provides the technical know-how and strategic insights into navigating the volatile yet rewarding world of digital assets. This bold Bitcoin strategy sets a new precedent for corporate engagement with digital assets. Why is DDC Enterprise Betting Big on Bitcoin? The decision by DDC Enterprise to commit such a substantial sum to Bitcoin is a testament to the cryptocurrency‚Äôs growing appeal as a legitimate store of value and a hedge against inflation. In an era of economic uncertainty and fluctuating fiat currencies, corporations are increasingly looking for alternative assets to diversify their portfolios and preserve capital. Bitcoin, often dubbed ‚Äúdigital gold,‚Äù offers a decentralized, borderless, and increasingly recognized solution. Here are some key motivations behind DDC‚Äôs significant investment in its Bitcoin strategy : Inflation Hedge: With its capped supply and decentralized nature, Bitcoin is seen by many as a robust hedge against the erosive effects of inflation, unlike traditional fiat currencies. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to their treasury provides DDC Enterprise with an asset class that often moves independently of traditional markets, offering portfolio diversification benefits. Long-Term Value Appreciation: Despite its inherent volatility, Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable long-term growth trends, attracting investors seeking significant capital appreciation. Embracing Digital Transformation: This move positions DDC Enterprise as a forward-thinking company, embracing the digital economy and the future of finance. It signals their readiness to integrate blockchain technology and digital assets into their core operations. Strategic Corporate Treasury Management: Beyond simple holding, the partnership aims to develop sophisticated strategies for managing these assets, including potential yield generation or strategic deployment to optimize their financial position. How Does Animoca Brands Propel This Bitcoin Strategy? Animoca Brands is not just any partner; they are a titan in the Web3 gaming and metaverse space, with a vast portfolio of investments and expertise in blockchain technology. Their role in this partnership is crucial, extending far beyond merely facilitating Bitcoin purchases. Animoca Brands brings a wealth of experience in: Blockchain Technology Integration: They possess a deep understanding of the underlying blockchain technology, ensuring secure and efficient management of digital assets for DDC Enterprise . Digital Asset Strategy: Their expertise lies in navigating the complexities of digital asset markets, including market dynamics, advanced security protocols, and evolving regulatory considerations, which are vital for substantial Bitcoin holdings . Web3 Ecosystem Insights: As a leader in Web3, Animoca Brands can provide DDC Enterprise with invaluable insights into the broader decentralized economy, opening doors for future innovations and strategic alignments. Network and Partnerships: Their extensive network within the crypto and blockchain industry can be leveraged for strategic advantages in Bitcoin accumulation and sophisticated corporate Bitcoin treasury management . This collaboration highlights the increasing convergence of traditional industries with the decentralized world. Animoca Brands is not just a gaming company; they are architects of the open metaverse, making them an ideal guide for DDC Enterprise as it ventures deeper into digital asset management and a comprehensive Bitcoin strategy . What Are the Broader Implications for Corporate Bitcoin Holdings? The partnership between DDC Enterprise and Animoca Brands sends a powerful signal to the global corporate community. It underscores a growing trend of companies recognizing Bitcoin as a legitimate and valuable asset for their balance sheets. While early adopters like MicroStrategy paved the way, DDC Enterprise‚Äôs move, especially as a NYSE-listed e-commerce company, adds significant weight to the institutional adoption narrative. However, venturing into corporate Bitcoin treasury management is not without its challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin‚Äôs price fluctuations can be significant, requiring robust risk management strategies and a long-term perspective. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving across jurisdictions, posing potential compliance challenges that necessitate careful navigation. Security Concerns: Storing large amounts of Bitcoin securely requires specialized knowledge, cutting-edge infrastructure, and vigilant protocols to guard against hacks and theft. Accounting and Tax Implications: Complexities arise in how Bitcoin holdings are accounted for and taxed in different regions, necessitating expert financial and legal advice. Despite these challenges, the potential benefits‚Äîfrom capital appreciation to enhanced brand perception as an innovator‚Äîare clearly outweighing the risks for companies like DDC Enterprise . This strategic move could inspire other e-commerce giants and traditional businesses to explore similar ventures, further legitimizing Bitcoin as a global reserve asset for corporations and accelerating the mainstream adoption of Web3 gaming principles in broader business contexts. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards the Future of Finance The $100 million Bitcoin strategy forged between DDC Enterprise and Animoca Brands is more than just an investment; it‚Äôs a statement. It‚Äôs a clear indication that digital assets, particularly Bitcoin , are moving from the periphery to the core of corporate financial planning. This collaboration leverages the strengths of both a seasoned e-commerce leader and a pioneering Web3 gaming powerhouse to navigate the complexities and capitalize on the immense opportunities within the decentralized economy. As DDC Enterprise accelerates its Bitcoin holdings and refines its corporate Bitcoin treasury management , the eyes of the financial world will undoubtedly be watching. This partnership serves as a compelling blueprint for how traditional businesses can strategically embrace blockchain technology and digital assets, paving the way for a more integrated and digitally native future for global commerce. It‚Äôs an exciting time to witness such bold moves shaping the financial landscape.

2025-07-10T19:16:36,"US Treasury Officially Scraps Crypto Broker Reporting Rules After Congressional Vote","The US Treasury Department officially scrapped crypto broker reporting rules on Thursday, following a vote by Congress to revoke them under the Congressional Review Act, which President Trump signed in April. BREAKING: CRYPTO TAXES The US Treasury has removed crypto broker reporting rules ‚Äî including Form‚ÄØ1099‚ÄëDA It was designed to require crypto brokers, including DeFi platforms, to report users‚Äô digital asset transactions to the IRS for tax compliance Let‚Äôs gooo! pic.twitter.com/dpGOASbW3Y ‚Äî Real World Asset Watchlist (@RWAwatchlist_) July 10, 2025 The regulation titled ‚ÄúGross Proceeds Reporting by Brokers that Regularly Provide Services Effectuating Digital Asset Sales‚Äù was published December 30, 2024, and is intended to require certain decentralized finance industry participants to file information returns as brokers effective February 28, 2025. Source: federalregister.gov Under Public Law 119-5 and the Congressional Review Act, the final rule has no legal force or effect and is considered null and void, as if it had never taken effect. The Treasury is removing the rule from the Code of Federal Regulations and reverting to the previous text, which excluded entities solely engaged in validating distributed ledger transactions or selling hardware for private key control from broker reporting requirements. Republicans in Congress successfully challenged the Biden-era rule that would have classified DeFi platforms as brokers, requiring extensive data collection and reporting obligations. The Treasury estimated that billions in crypto-related taxes were going uncollected annually, but industry advocates argued that the requirements were technically impossible for decentralized platforms to implement. The regulation faced widespread criticism for misunderstanding decentralized technology and potentially driving innovation overseas, prompting legal challenges from the Blockchain Association and Texas Blockchain Council . Congressional Battle Over DeFi Innovation and Tax Compliance Senator Ted Cruz led the Congressional Review Act resolution alongside Representative Mike Carey, arguing the rule represented government overreach that would stifle American cryptocurrency innovation. Cruz stated the regulation ‚Äú directly and immediately would harm American cryptocurrency innovation and drive development overseas. ‚Äú 1/ @SenTedCruz ‚Äôs CRA resolution to roll back the DeFi Broker Rule ‚Äì anti-crypto, anti-privacy IRS midnight rulemaking ‚Äì is critical to providing clarity for crypto and DeFi in the US. Congress should vote YES on the CRA. This has been a long battle‚Ä¶ How did we get here? ‚Äî Kristin Smith (@KMSmithDC) February 12, 2025 The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated repealing the rule could cost the government nearly $4 billion over ten years in lost tax revenue. Despite projected losses, lawmakers supporting repeal prioritized privacy, technical feasibility, and innovation over tax collection efficiency. House Financial Services Committee Chairman French Hill also condemned the proposal as excessive government intervention, arguing that defining DeFi software providers as brokers would create costly reporting obligations for entities that never take custody of user funds. The regulation threatened to push American digital asset development overseas while undermining technological progress. White House Crypto Czar David Sacks supported the repeal effort, calling the regulation an ‚Äú 11th-hour attack on the crypto community by the Biden administration. ‚Äù The White House is pleased to announce its support for the CRA introduced by @SenTedCruz and @RepMikeCarey to rescind the so-called Broker DeFi Rule, an 11th hour attack on the crypto community by the Biden administration. pic.twitter.com/T7Hxasb4aC ‚Äî David Sacks (@davidsacks47) March 4, 2025 The administration positioned itself as strongly supportive of crypto industry concerns while establishing federal working groups on digital asset regulation. The successful repeal prevents the IRS from reintroducing similar proposals in the future, marking a significant victory for DeFi advocates. Broader Regulatory Shifts Signal Pro-Crypto Policy Direction The Treasury Department separately announced exemptions that will free banks and brokerage firms from reporting customers‚Äô crypto holdings on financial statements, contingent upon demonstrating effective digital asset risk management capabilities. The SEC began issuing guidance clarifying that some crypto arrangements might not qualify as liabilities for reporting purposes. These regulatory relief measures came amid sustained Congressional pressure to revise the controversial SAB 121 accounting bulletin. While the Senate voted to overturn SAB 121 in May with 60 senators supporting repeal, President Biden‚Äôs veto prevented the measure from taking effect. States continue advancing Bitcoin legislation independently of federal action, with 23 states introducing Bitcoin reserve bills and 35 proposals under consideration. In fact, following that, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear signed the ‚ÄúBitcoin Rights‚Äù bill into law . Beyond the United States, Japan‚Äôs Senate has also recently approved legal amendments that give crypto brokerage firms increased operational freedom through new ‚Äúintermediary business‚Äù categories, which come with reduced regulatory barriers. The legislation creates customer safeguards while promoting innovation, requiring the Prime Minister‚Äôs approval for crypto operators to hold assets domestically.

Touching on many topics from his trip in Bhutan to new regulations in the US, Teng said that global crypto adoption is accelerating. Speaking about his visit to Bhutan, Teng noted that thanks to a partnership with the country's Ministry of Tourism and the local DK Bank, Bitcoin payments are now available at over 1,000 businesses. Teng explained that cryptocurrency is used for a wide range of transactions, from accommodation and airline tickets to tour guide payments and souvenir shopping. ‚ÄúThis system is secure, cost-effective, and highly effective for both users and local businesses,‚Äù he said. Teng noted that Bhutan has embraced crypto not only in terms of usage but also in terms of reserves. He explained that the country began mining Bitcoin using green energy five years ago and currently holds a substantial Bitcoin reserve. He also explained that assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance Coin (BNB) have been included in strategic reserves within Bhutan's special economic zone, the GMC. Teng also touched on developments in the US, saying, ‚ÄúPresident Trump is strategically approaching future technologies like blockchain and artificial intelligence. His vision for the US to be the center of the crypto world offers great opportunities not only for economic growth but also for high-value-added employment and foreign direct investment.‚Äù Related News: BREAKING: Bitcoin (BTC) Breaks All-Time High Again ‚Äî Here's Why and What Analysts Think Will Happen Next According to Binance CEO, Congress is preparing to vote on new legislation regarding stablecoins and market structure as part of ‚ÄúCrypto Week‚Äù in mid-July, heralding a new era for the sector. ‚ÄúThese developments demonstrate that the US is moving away from its past repressive approach and embracing a supportive approach to innovation,‚Äù Teng said, adding that the establishment of a clear regulatory framework will make responsible innovation possible. Teng, who announced that Binance's user base has surpassed 280 million, stated that this growth is largely due to institutional investors entering the crypto market. ‚ÄúIt's not just individual investors; corporate treasuries, foundations, family offices, and even sovereign wealth funds are also showing interest in crypto. Global crypto adoption is currently only at 7%, but the next 10% increase will come much faster,‚Äù he said. Teng also addressed a new proposal being floated in the US. Under the plan, supported by President Trump, institutions like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would consider crypto assets in their creditworthiness analysis. ‚ÄúThe American dream has traditionally been defined by homeownership,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIncluding crypto assets in this process not only increases financial inclusion but also increases the mainstream adoption of crypto.‚Äù According to Richard Teng, regulatory clarity and political support in the US will push other countries to follow suit. ‚ÄúIf the US leads, the rest of the world will not want to miss this opportunity,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt is now clear that crypto offers a strategic advantage in economic competition.‚Äù The Binance CEO concluded his speech by saying, ‚ÄúWe are now entering a new dawn.

2025-07-10T19:03:34,"BTC All-Time High Liveblog: Is This Run Different?","Bitcoin just blew past $113,800 on Thursday , setting a new all-time high. The oldest digital asset has been on a tear for the last several months ‚Äî and has nearly doubled over the past year, climbing from $57,899 a year ago today. CoinDesk analysts and industry experts are watching closely to see if bitcoin (BTC) can rise to $120,000, or if this week's price action is just an ephemeral gasp. This liveblog will be updated regularly. Scroll down for the latest. Unknown block type ""divider"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Nikhilesh De, CoinDesk managing editor for Global Policy & Regulation (19:20 UTC): Some are attributing bitcoin's all-time high to global currency fluctuations, saying that while $113,800 is indeed the highest BTC has been relative to USD, it's not the highest it's been relative to other currencies. And indeed, valuing BTC in terms of the U.S. dollar as opposed to other currencies or even other cryptocurrencies has long spurred debate within the industry. Helene Braun, CoinDesk markets reporter (19:12 UTC): Crypto-linked stocks are on fire, with crypto exchanges such as Robinhood (HOOD) and Coinbase (COIN) rising more than 3% on Thursday. Meanwhile, the miners such as Hut 8, Bitfarms, and HIVE Digital are up more than 4%. Interestingly, the stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL), the hottest new crypto IPO stock, is only up by 0.4%. James Van Straten, CoinDesk Bitcoin analyst (18:55 UTC): The 2021 bull run's second half was purely leverage and derivatives-driven. It had a 50% hash rate correction, and all on-chain metrics were bearish, plus we had incoming fed rate hikes for the first time. Market cycle is completely different with a new buyer in the market, a new Fed chair potentially incoming with cuts and a crypto-pro U.S. president. Also, don't forget the swath of bitcoin buying treasury companies. Oliver Knight, co-leader of CoinDesk data and tokens (18:55 UTC): Net accounts are still short (CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole mentioned this was a retail indicator). This is interesting, as in previous cycles, we had retail euphoria, but not so much this time. However, while on the surface a record high for bitcoin is almost certainly bullish, a number of technical indicators paint a different picture: the daily RSI has now made three lower highs, an example of bearish divergence indicating the move could be short-lived. Trading volume has also dropped off since the initial record high in January, and BTC is still below its respective record highs against EUR and GBP, indicating dollar weakness over BTC strength. Also, the trading firms I speak to are bearish, but it is worth noting that they were also bearish from BTC's $30k to $70k run in the last cycle's double top.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/10/btc-all-time-high-liveblog-is-this-run-different,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|REGULATION|BUSINESS","Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Liveblog|Top Stories|market analysis|News",cryptocompare

The objective is to prevent criminal misuse of the financial system while bringing more clarity and consistency for businesses. ‚ÄúCabinet has agreed to introduce a bill to strengthen enforcement powers for police and regulators to crack down on those involved in money laundering.

What Sparked the Urgent ESMA MiCA Scrutiny? The core of the matter revolves around the authorization of a specific crypto asset service provider (CASP) in Malta. ESMA, the European Union‚Äôs financial markets regulator, has expressed significant concerns regarding a ‚Äòfast-tracked‚Äô authorization process. According to reports from CoinDesk, this authorization was allegedly granted despite a notable lack of thoroughness and the presence of unresolved issues. This raises an urgent question about the integrity of the regulatory procedures in place. The Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation is designed to create a harmonized legal framework for crypto assets across the EU, aiming to protect investors, ensure market integrity, and foster innovation responsibly. ESMA‚Äôs intervention underscores its commitment to upholding these standards, ensuring that national authorities are diligently applying the new rules. This ESMA MiCA scrutiny is a clear signal that laxity in compliance will not be tolerated. Malta Crypto Regulations Under the Microscope: A Reputational Challenge? Malta has historically positioned itself as a ‚ÄòBlockchain Island,‚Äô aiming to be a pioneer in crypto regulation. Its early adoption of frameworks for virtual financial assets (VFAs) attracted numerous crypto businesses. However, this recent development places Malta‚Äôs regulatory prowess and the effectiveness of its national financial watchdog, the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA), directly under the microscope. ESMA‚Äôs concerns about the ‚Äòlack of thoroughness‚Äô in the authorization process imply that the MFSA may have issued a license without ensuring necessary remediation or fully addressing all outstanding issues. This could significantly impact the perception of Malta crypto regulations on the international stage, potentially eroding trust among prospective businesses and investors who seek robust and reliable regulatory environments. Key Concerns Regarding Malta‚Äôs Regulatory Process: Fast-tracked Authorization: Allegations of licenses being issued too quickly without adequate due diligence. Unresolved Issues: Indications that pre-existing problems or compliance gaps were not fully addressed before authorization. Lack of Thoroughness: A broader concern about the depth and rigor of the MFSA‚Äôs review process for CASP applications. Reputational Risk: The potential for Malta‚Äôs standing as a reputable crypto hub to be diminished. The Enigma of OKX Authorization: A Case Study in Due Diligence? While not officially confirmed by ESMA or the MFSA, OKX Exchange, a major global crypto platform, is widely suspected to be the entity in question. OKX received ‚Äòpre-authorization‚Äô in Malta earlier this year, making it a plausible candidate for the CASP under review. The specifics of OKX authorization in Malta, particularly the conditions of its pre-authorization, are now subject to intense speculation. This situation highlights the complexities of licensing large, international crypto exchanges. Regulators must balance the desire to attract innovation with the imperative to protect consumers and maintain financial stability. If a major player like OKX is involved in a case where due diligence was reportedly lacking, it sets a concerning precedent for the entire industry and underscores the need for transparent and rigorous licensing protocols. Navigating the Future: Implications for Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) This incident carries significant implications for all Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) operating or planning to operate within the European Union. MiCA is designed to standardize regulatory requirements across all 27 EU member states, ensuring a level playing field and preventing regulatory arbitrage. ESMA‚Äôs proactive stance in scrutinizing Malta‚Äôs compliance suggests that national regulators will be held to a high standard. CASPs, whether exchanges, custodians, or issuers of crypto assets, must understand that compliance is not merely a formality but a continuous commitment. This event could lead to: Stricter Scrutiny: Other EU member states might adopt even more cautious and thorough approaches to MiCA implementation and CASP licensing. Enhanced Due Diligence: Regulators may demand more extensive documentation, more robust internal controls, and clearer remediation plans for any identified deficiencies. Increased Compliance Costs: CASPs will likely need to invest more in legal, compliance, and technological infrastructure to meet evolving regulatory expectations. Precedent Setting: The outcome of ESMA‚Äôs review of Malta could establish critical benchmarks for how MiCA is interpreted and enforced across the bloc. The MFSA Investigation: Upholding Regulatory Integrity For the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA), this investigation represents a critical moment. As the primary financial regulator in Malta, its credibility and effectiveness are now being evaluated by a higher European authority. The outcome of the MFSA investigation will determine not only the immediate actions required but also the long-term trust placed in Malta‚Äôs regulatory framework. The MFSA will likely need to demonstrate a clear action plan for addressing ESMA‚Äôs concerns, which could include reviewing past authorizations, implementing stricter internal procedures, and enhancing transparency. This situation highlights the delicate balance national regulators must strike between fostering innovation in emerging sectors like crypto and ensuring robust consumer protection and market integrity. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Industry: In light of these developments, crypto businesses and aspiring CASPs should consider the following: Proactive Engagement: Engage early and often with regulatory bodies to understand their expectations and address potential issues before they escalate. Robust Compliance Frameworks: Invest significantly in internal compliance teams, technologies, and processes that can adapt to evolving regulatory landscapes. Deep Understanding of MiCA: Ensure your legal and compliance teams have an exhaustive understanding of MiCA‚Äôs requirements and how they are being interpreted by national authorities. Transparency and Remediation: Be transparent about any past or current compliance issues and demonstrate clear, actionable plans for their remediation. Jurisdictional Due Diligence: Carefully assess the regulatory reputation and track record of any jurisdiction before committing to an authorization process. Conclusion: The Dawn of a New Regulatory Era The ESMA investigation into Malta‚Äôs MiCA compliance, particularly concerning the suspected OKX authorization, marks a significant moment in European crypto regulation. It unequivocally signals that the era of ‚Äòregulation light‚Äô or ‚Äòfast-track‚Äô approvals in the crypto space is rapidly drawing to a close. As MiCA comes into full effect, regulatory thoroughness and strict adherence to established protocols will become non-negotiable. This incident serves as a powerful reminder that while innovation is encouraged, it must always be balanced with robust oversight and unwavering commitment to investor protection and market integrity. The future of crypto in Europe will be defined by compliance, transparency, and a collaborative effort between innovative businesses and vigilant regulators.

2025-07-10T18:30:42,"The Hidden Clue In Bitcoin Hourly Close: A Breakout Brewing?","Bitcoin‚Äôs latest hourly close may be offering more than meets the eye. With the 25- and 50-hour SMAs holding firm and the MACD showing renewed expansion, some analysts believe a breakout could be quietly brewing, and smart traders are starting to take notice. BTC‚Äôs Momentum Builds With Healthy Technical Backing In his latest 1-hour market update, Shaco AI noted that Bitcoin continues to humor the bulls, printing a strong close at $111,225.5. The price action has maintained a clear bullish bias, staying well above both the 25-hour simple moving average (SMA) at $110,147 and the 50-hour SMA at $109,420. This positioning suggests that BTC is building a solid base for continuation, with short-term trend followers likely remaining confident in the move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Moving With Stocks, But Ethereum‚Äôs Correlation Is Fading Furthermore, the MACD has widened impressively, with a gain of $589.72, reflecting persistent buying pressure and bullish sentiment. As the MACD histogram expands and signal lines diverge, it reinforces the idea that the bulls may be far from done, and dips could be viewed as buying opportunities. Shaco AI also pointed to the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which now sits at 63.73. This level shows that the market is in a healthy bullish zone, strong enough to maintain upward momentum, but not yet in overbought territory that typically invites profit-taking or cooling off. Adding confidence to the trend, the Average Directional Index (ADX) has hit 38.93, which Shaco AI emphasized as a key confirmation that the current trend has strength and durability. With all key indicators pointing to continued bullish structure, supported by rising momentum, trend alignment, and strong directional force, Bitcoin‚Äôs short-term technical picture remains decisively positive. The bulls are in control, and the chart suggests they may not be done pushing just yet. Breakout Or Breakdown? Bitcoin Poised At A Technical Crossroads Shaco AI, in his final remarks, highlighted that Bitcoin is approaching critical territory, marking resistance at $111,999.79 and support at $108,096.55 as the key zones to watch. He urged traders to ‚Äúwatch these like a hawk!‚Äù as price action around these levels could be decisive in determining BTC‚Äôs next major move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Resumes Upward Move ‚Äî Can It Break New Highs? He also pointed out that trading volume has been unusually quiet, joking that it ‚Äúseems to have missed some coffee breaks,‚Äù with just 395 units recorded compared to the average of 869. This lighter volume signals reduced conviction, which could lead to sudden volatility or fakeouts near those key zones. ‚ÄúKeep those eyes peeled for potential breakouts or retracements as BTC flirts with key levels, but do remember there‚Äôs caution in the air with this lighter trading volume,‚Äù the expert added.

The flagship coin is now in price discovery mode, which could lead to more bullish momentum in the coming days and possibly weeks. Bitcoin‚Äôs daily average trading volume surged over 50 percent in the past 24 hours to hover about $66 billion. As a result of the heightened volatility, more than $325 million was liquidated from BTC‚Äôs leveraged positions in the past 24 hours. Top Reasons Why Bitcoin Price Surged Today The Bitcoin price pump above $113k, for the first time its inception, on Thursday is a culmination of several factors. At the top list is the unwavering support from institutional investors led by the U.S. spot BTC ETFs and corporations such as Strategy and Metaplanet. BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT has led in daily net cash inflows, whereby the ETF registered an inflow of about $125 million on Wednesday. Bitcoin price has experienced bullish activity in the recent past fueled by rising global money supply (M2). The M2 is expected to grow exponentially in the near future, especially after the United States recently approved the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which is estimated to increase the federal deficit by $3.3 trillion in the coming years. The notable BTC price upsurge is also fueled by the rising futures and Open Interest (OI) market. According to market data from Coinglass , Bitcoin OI surged around 10 percent in the past 24 hours to hover about $80 billion at the time of this writing. What Next? Following Today‚Äôs BTC price pump, the wider altcoin market rallied in tandem. Ethereum (ETH) price surged over 2 percent today to trade around $2,830 at the time of this writing. As a result, Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance declined to 64.7 percent, suggesting more investors are betting on an altseason. #total_2 update: breakout, send it https://t.co/FcAMeXd4VM pic.twitter.com/PnlkbXkbOj ‚Äî CryptoBoss (@CryptoBoss1984) July 10, 2025 From a technical analysis standpoint, crypto analyst alias CryptoBoss thinks the parabolic phase of the altcoin market has started and is likely to last through the end of the year.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-price-sets-new-ath-of-above-113-7k-on-july-10-is-crypto-parabolic-rally-next/,"TRADING|BTC|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS","Price Analysis|Bitcoin|Bitcoin ETF|Crypto news",cryptocompare

2025-07-10T18:11:11,"Ethereum Foundation unveils new strategy to accelerate ecosystem growth","The Ethereum Foundation (EF) has unveiled a new vision for its role in the blockchain‚Äôs evolution in a strategy update titled ‚ÄúThe Future of Ecosystem Development at the EF.‚ÄùThe vision focuses on ecosystem acceleration, ecosystem amplification, ecosystem support, and long-term ecosystem unblocking. EF announced a new organizational structure, expanding its core teams around four pillars, including enterprise relations, developer growth, app relations & research, and founder success. Recently, big institutional investors, who used to be drawn to Bitcoin, are now turning more and more to Ethereum (ETH). This change isn‚Äôt just caused by the way the market works; it‚Äôs a big change in how institutions think about digital assets. In a blog, the Ethereum Foundation has said, ‚ÄúInterest in Ethereum has expanded beyond technologists and enthusiasts, bringing enterprises, governments, and everyday users who seek practical solutions and tangible benefits. The Ethereum ecosystem is adapting to meet these needs, and the Ethereum Foundation is ready to play its part.‚Äù The numbers tell the story. The network saw a huge rise of $9.7 billion in flows in just one month, with net flows reaching $1.3 billion in the last week alone. This huge increase shows institutional investors are very optimistic about Ethereum‚Äôs long-term growth prospects. Also, since transaction costs have dropped to about $0.10, companies are finding an ecosystem that is both cost-effective and encourages innovation on a scale that has never been seen before. A goal to maximize the direct and indirect users The foundation has highlighted two main goals. One is to maximize the number of people who directly or indirectly use Ethereum, in such a way that they benefit from Ethereum‚Äôs underlying values. To achieve this, the foundation plans to work with existing networks and community members to speed up EcoDev. According to them, Ethereum already has many users and organizations that help founders, developers, apps, businesses, and community events. These groups and individuals include L2s, accelerators, investors, instructors, and more. According to the foundation, ‚ÄúWe want to help accelerate the pace of ecosystem growth by working closely with developers, founders, app teams, and enterprises who want to use Ethereum.‚Äù Companies like Sharplink Gaming and Bit Digital are at the forefront of migrating from Bitcoin to Ethereum. Recent disclosures have revealed that Sharplink Gaming boasts an impressive reserve of 198,167 ETH. This positions it as the world‚Äôs largest institutional ETH holder, just behind the Ethereum Foundation. Also, Bit Digital announced an ambitious fundraising target of $ 172 million and later purchased over 100,000 ETH. This underlined its strategic pivot toward Ethereum staking, drawing attention to Ethereum‚Äôs rising prominence. Maximize the resilience of Ethereum‚Äôs technical infrastructure. The second goal is to maximize the resilience of Ethereum‚Äôs technical and social infrastructure. This is a critical one. According to SlowMist , Ethereum led all ecosystems in security losses in the first half of 2025, with DeFi platforms losing around $470 million. The report revealed emerging risks were tied to Ethereum‚Äôs EIP-7702 wallet delegation feature. It was introduced as part of the Pectra upgrade earlier this year. The feature allows users to authorize smart contracts to act on their behalf without having to swap out their wallet address. According to SlowMist, the exploit used standard wallet tools to trick the user into approving token access in bulk, a type of risk that anti-phishing tools may not always detect. ‚ÄúEven if the contract itself has no backdoors, if you are tricked by a phishing site into granting authorization, attackers can exploit the contract‚Äôs full operational capabilities to drain your assets in bulk,‚Äù SlowMist said. In addition, the firm noted that other risks associated with EIP-7702 include potential private key leaks, replay attacks across multiple chains, and issues that could arise during wallet upgrades. In addition, EIP-7702 brings ‚Äúnew risk boundaries,‚Äù adding that users must fully understand who they are authorizing and what permissions they grant before signing any delegation.

Altcoins like Pengu, PI, SUI and Hyper also made sharp moves in the session. How BTC hit a new ATH At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $113,635, up more than 4% from the previous day. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the top crypto‚Äôs total market was at $2.25 trillion, also increasing by more than 3%. Bitcoin‚Äôs trading volume also saw a sharp surge of over 44% to $64.71 billion. Bitcoin recently broke out of its weeks-long consolidation range, which had been confined between $105,000 and $110,000. The cryptocurrency surpassed the $110,000 resistance level with relative ease, reaching a new all-time high of $112,000 amid rising demand from U.S. investors. Although BTC pulled back slightly earlier today, bullish momentum returned quickly, driving the asset to another peak above $113,000. Altcoins have also recorded notable gains over the past 24 hours, contributing to a surge in market-wide liquidations, which hit a multi-week high of $600 million. Short positions accounted for the majority of these losses, including a single large liquidation exceeding $51 million involving an unidentified investor. In the past hour alone, liquidations have surpassed $80 million, as both bitcoin and alternative cryptocurrencies regain upward momentum. More companies add BTC KULR Technology Group became the latest corporation to beef up its bitcoin treasury. The company acquired 90 BTC for approximately $10 million at an average price of $108,884 per coin, inclusive of fees and expenses. According to a post by CEO Michael Mo on July 9, 2025, KULR has achieved a year-to-date Bitcoin yield of 291%. The firm now holds a total of 1,021 BTC, acquired for around $101 million at an average cost of $98,627 per bitcoin. KULR confirmed that the latest acquisitions align with its Bitcoin Treasury Strategy, which was first introduced on December 4, 2024. Under this approach, the company allocates up to 90% of its surplus cash reserves to bitcoin. K Wave Media Inc. also announced a $1 billion financing package to advance its bitcoin acquisition strategy. The funding includes a newly signed $500 million convertible note agreement with Anson Funds and a previously disclosed $500 million standby equity purchase agreement with Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, the company stated in an announcement on Thursday. As part of the initiative, K Wave has already acquired 88 BTC and plans to issue $15 million in senior secured convertible notes and warrants in the first tranche. The company intends to allocate at least 80% of these proceeds toward additional bitcoin purchases. The financing arrangement allows for the potential issuance of up to $500 million in convertible notes and warrants, with the conversion price set at $4.40 per share. KULR and K Wave join a growing list of publicly traded firms incorporating bitcoin into their treasury strategies, following in the footsteps of companies like MicroStrategy, a major corporate holder of the cryptocurrency. As bitcoin adoption expands, BTC yield is emerging as a key performance indicator for companies with digital asset holdings. Other Altcoins The total cryptocurrency market cap was up 3% to $3.51 trillion. The fear and greed index jumped to 58 from 52 yesterday. The index is still in neutral territory.

The token also hit its all time high of $0.64 in the session, although now it has retreated from that level. Hyper jumped after up HYPER/KRW pair listing announcement on Upbit, one of South Korea‚Äôs largest crypto exchanges. PENGU: Pudgy Penguins token soared 32% in the last 24 hours to $0.019. The token jumped after the US Securities and Exchange Commission acknowledged Canary Capital‚Äôs paper to list a Pengu-based ETF. PI: PI token jumped more than 6% to $0.49 after the Pi Core Team introduced a new no-code app development tool, Pi App Studio, during Pi2Day.

More than 12,000 applications were created on the Pi App Studio in two weeks. SUI: SUI gained over 10% in the session to $3.39. A major driver of the recent bullish momentum is the launch of Threshold Network‚Äôs tBTC on the Sui blockchain. tBTC, an ERC-20 token backed 1-to-1 by bitcoin, is now integrated into the Sui network‚Äîa move that could introduce over $500 million in bitcoin liquidity.

Just a day after breaching the $112,000 mark for the first time, Bitcoin has extended its rally to hit a fresh peak of $113,317, according to CoinGecko data . Bitcoin price chart | Source: CoinGecko This historic move came after a prolonged period of sideways trading that kept BTC trapped between $105,000 and $110,000. The breakout was sparked by a renewed push from President Donald Trump for the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates. His remarks on Truth Social emphasised the strength of the markets and called for urgent monetary easing, saying that the Fed should ‚Äúrapidly lower rates‚Äù and that there was ‚Äúno inflation.‚Äù Traders quickly responded to the statement, viewing it as a signal that a looser monetary environment could be on the horizon. This anticipation triggered an immediate influx of capital into crypto markets, pushing Bitcoin out of its consolidation zone and into price discovery mode. As the price of Bitcoin soared, the broader crypto market followed suit . Ethereum (ETH) has gained nearly 5%, climbing above $2,800, while Dogecoin (DOGE) has spiked by more than 5.5%, reflecting the bullish sentiment across the board. Over half a billion dollars‚Äô worth of Bitcoin short positions liquidated According to data from Coinglass , over $600 million in leveraged positions have been wiped out within 24 hours, marking one of the highest daily liquidation totals in recent weeks. The majority of these losses came from short sellers who were betting against the rally. In a particularly notable event, a single large position, widely believed to belong to a major institutional player, was liquidated for more than $51 million. According to CoinGlass data, more than $80 million in liquidations occurred within a single hour as Bitcoin‚Äôs rally gained steam. The liquidation pressure likely contributed to the swift momentum, as short positions were forcefully closed, creating additional upward buying pressure. Market analysts have pointed to a combination of technical and macroeconomic factors driving this breakout. Joe DiPasquale, CEO of BitBull Capital, noted that institutional demand, strong ETF inflows, and a general risk-on environment are helping push Bitcoin into uncharted territory. He explained that once Bitcoin crossed the key psychological resistance at $110,000, sidelined capital began to flow back into the market aggressively. On-chain data, according to DiPasquale, still shows room for further growth, although the market remains vulnerable to sudden corrections if sentiment shifts. While the Federal Reserve has been cautious about further interest rate cuts, pressure from the executive branch may influence its stance, especially as inflation has cooled and markets appear resilient. Investors are watching closely for any policy changes that could further validate this bullish narrative. In the meantime, Bitcoin‚Äôs new record high solidifies its dominance in the crypto landscape and reaffirms its role as a macro-sensitive asset.

Institutional investment has once again pushed Bitcoin ( BTC ) to an all-time high. On Thursday, June 10, Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $113,358.50 for a second consecutive day. The largest crypto asset was up 3.65% over a 24-hour period and has risen almost 96.2% from the same time last year. Fueling this price increase is growing demand for Bitcoin ETFs, a positive macro environment, and expanding corporate BTC treasury holdings. Both retail traders and institutions are bullish as the U.S. environment shifts toward a more crypto-friendly stance. At the same time, a falling dollar has prompted many institutions to look for safe-haven assets. You might also like: Are Bitcoin treasury companies a new bubble akin to the ICO boom?
