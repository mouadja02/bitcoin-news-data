2025-07-10T12:50:09,"Bulls Now Control Bitcoin! What's BTC's Next Target? Analysts Explain!","The leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) reached the $112,000 mark with a new record following May. This new record also increases the expectation of a rise in Bitcoin, with Milk Road co-founder Kyle Reidhead predicting that Bitcoin could reach $150,000. What's the Next Target for Bitcoin? At this point, Kyle Reidhead, in an X post, stated that there is a “bullish cup and handle” formation in Bitcoin that he thinks will push the price up, and said, “See you at $150,000.” The cup and handle formation, which the analyst predicts will carry BTC to $150,000, is interpreted as a signal of an uptrend, which will pause for consolidation and sideways movement, then continue to rise. Analyst CryptoBusy also noted a bullish flag formation on Bitcoin's 4-hour chart, stating that a close above $112,000 could lead to a rise reaching $120,000 in the short term. Cryptocurrency analyst Matthew Hyland also stated that Bitcoin could continue its rise, saying that from a technical perspective, Bitcoin has broken out of its recent downtrend. “Bitcoin confirms its daily rally and confirms the end of the downtrend that began in late May. “The bulls are in control” eToro analyst Josh Gilbert also spoke after the rally, noting that the recent rally was institutionally driven, saying, “This is the first true bull market where institutional participation is at the forefront. Strong ETF inflows and a solid macroeconomic backdrop have helped fuel market momentum, but perhaps the most important change is who is buying.” Coinstash co-founder Mena Theodorou offered a similar view to Josh Gilbert, saying, “It's clear this rally is driven by institutions, not retail investors.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-10T12:46:52,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Sky Is The Limit As BTC Surges To New All-Time High","Bitcoin (BTC) soared to a new all-time high on Wednesday, crossing $112,000 on Coinbase before retreating and settling at $111,255. The flagship cryptocurrency’s rally was supported by strong institutional support, as traders threw caution to the wind and ignored tariff tensions. BTC and the broader market’s sharp rally saw over 114,000 traders liquidated, with a majority of losses due to short positions. Bitcoin (BTC) Soars To New All-Time High Bitcoin (BTC) rallied to a new all-time high, moving past $112,000 on Coinbase, as it hit record levels. The flagship cryptocurrency briefly crossed $112,000 on Wednesday, reaching $112,055 before retreating and settling at $111,255. The previous high on Coinbase was $111,891, set back in May. The flagship cryptocurrency surged on Wednesday after investors liquidated over $280 million in short positions, according to data from Coinglass. Strahinja Savic, head of data analytics at FRNT Financial, stated, “For the asset's proponents, the global situation is exactly why they would have bought the asset in the first place. In the U.S., there is growing awareness that the fiscal situation is unsustainable and that the country lacks the capacity for reform.” BTC is up around 20% year-to-date despite trading between $100,000 and $110,000 as investors remained cautious about trade tariffs, a hawkish Fed, and macroeconomic uncertainties. “Beyond the U.S., there is no shortage of geopolitical and macro anxieties, from the Russia-Ukraine war to Middle East hostilities.” Did Nvidia Surge Propel Bitcoin (BTC) Past $112,000? Bitcoin (BTC) soared past $112,000 on Wednesday as an Nvidia-led rally pushed the flagship cryptocurrency to record levels. BTC has been trading in a range for weeks, despite billions flowing into spot Bitcoin ETFs. The stock market rallied on Wednesday after Nvidia became the first company to reach $4 trillion in market capitalization, albeit briefly. Investors also ignored negative sentiment around tariffs, creating a risk-on environment in the market. Institutions have embraced Bitcoin’s “digital gold” narrative. However, it remains a risky asset, rising and falling alongside the traditional markets. When markets are in risk-on mode and investors buy assets like tech stocks, BTC , and the broader crypto market rallies. Investors and analysts expect Bitcoin to reach new highs in the latter half of 2025 as corporate treasuries buy Bitcoin and the US gets closer to crypto legislation being passed in Congress. Ryan Gorman, chief strategy officer at Uranium Digital, predicted further bullishness, stating, “With crypto week on the horizon next week in DC, and a likely flood of positive momentum heading into the dog days of summer, bullish sentiment and thinner trading volumes could see prices gap up to $120,000 or higher by the end of next week. How far we rally through the summer is anyone’s guess, but open call interest outweighs puts, which normally reveals traders are bullish and expect upward price momentum to continue.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) re-entered price discovery mode on Wednesday after racing past $112,000. The flagship cryptocurrency started the week in the red, dropping nearly 1% on Monday. It recovered on Tuesday, rising 0.62% to $108,942. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as the price rallied past $112,000 before registering a marginal decline during the ongoing session. BTC's latest rally has unleashed a wave of optimism among analysts and investors, with Milk Road co-founder Kyle Reidhead believing a move to $150,000 is imminent. He highlighted a bullish “cup and handle” formation that could push the price to this level. The market optimism comes after weeks of consolidation, which raised concerns about BTC’s ability to surpass May’s record highs. The rally couldn’t have come at a better time for BTC . Just hours before its rally, an analyst stated that if the flagship cryptocurrency does not reach a new high within the next two weeks, it would have to wait till October to test these levels again. Market sentiment has picked up as well, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index posting a “Greed” score of 71 out of 100. According to analyst Matthew Hyland, Bitcoin has broken out of its recent downtrend. Hyland stated, “ BTC confirms daily higher-high and confirms an end to the downtrend that started in late May.” Others, like eToro analyst Josh Gilbert, believe this is the first bull market that has clear institutional participation. “This is the first real bull market where institutional participation is front and center.” BTC ended the previous weekend in positive territory, rising nearly 1% on Sunday (June 29) and settling at $108,350. The price was back in the red on Monday, dropping 1.09% to $107,168. Selling pressure intensified on Tuesday as BTC fell 1.33%, slipping below $106,000 to $105,740. The price recovered on Wednesday, surging nearly 3% to reclaim $108,000 and settle at $108,845. Buyers retained control on Thursday as BTC rose 0.73%, briefly crossing $110,000 before settling at $109,637. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC lost momentum on Friday, dropping 1.41% to settle at $108,097.

2025-07-10T12:40:29,"Bitcoin ETFs Achieve Monumental $50 Billion Inflows: A Game-Changer for Crypto Investment","The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with a truly remarkable achievement: U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have not just arrived, they’ve absolutely exploded, topping an astounding $50 billion in net inflows within just 18 months of their launch. This isn’t just a number; it’s a clear signal of growing mainstream acceptance and institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. For years, the crypto community yearned for accessible, regulated investment vehicles, and now, the data speaks volumes about their impact. Unpacking the Phenomenal Growth of US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Since their eagerly anticipated debut in January 2024, U.S. spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs have rapidly become a cornerstone of the financial landscape, attracting an unprecedented volume of capital. According to Cointelegraph, citing data from Farside Investors, these investment vehicles have collectively surpassed the $50 billion mark in net inflows in a remarkably short period. This rapid accumulation of assets underscores a significant shift in how traditional investors are engaging with digital assets. A Spot Bitcoin ETF offers investors direct exposure to the price movements of Bitcoin without requiring them to directly buy, store, or manage the underlying cryptocurrency. This simplicity, combined with the regulatory oversight of traditional financial markets, has proven to be an irresistible combination for a wide range of investors, from individual retail participants to large institutional players. Key Players and Their Performance The race for market share among these new funds has been intense, with some clear leaders emerging. Here’s a snapshot of the top performers and their contribution to this monumental inflow: Fund Net Inflows/Outflows (Approx.) Key Highlight BlackRock’s IBIT +$53 billion The undisputed leader, showcasing massive institutional demand. Fidelity’s FBTC +$12.29 billion Strong performance, cementing its position as a major contender. Grayscale’s GBTC -$23.34 billion Experienced outflows due to its conversion from a trust, but remains a significant player. BlackRock’s IBIT has been a standout performer, leading the pack with an astonishing $53 billion in inflows. This dominance highlights the immense trust and capital that institutional investors are channeling through established financial giants. Fidelity’s FBTC has also demonstrated robust performance, securing over $12 billion in inflows and reinforcing the widespread appeal of these regulated products. Grayscale’s GBTC, while showing significant outflows, presents a unique case. Its conversion from a closed-end trust to an ETF allowed investors who were previously locked in to redeem their shares, leading to profit-taking and arbitrage opportunities. Despite these outflows, GBTC remains a crucial part of the ecosystem, representing a foundational piece of the original institutional interest in Bitcoin. Why Are BTC ETFs Attracting So Much Capital? The question on many Bitcoin ETFsminds is, what makes these BTC ETFs so incredibly attractive? Several factors contribute to their magnetic appeal, drawing in capital at an unprecedented rate: Accessibility: For traditional investors, purchasing Bitcoin directly can be complex. ETFs simplify this process, allowing them to gain exposure through familiar brokerage accounts, just like buying stocks or mutual funds. Regulatory Clarity: The approval of these ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provided a stamp of legitimacy that the crypto market desperately sought. This regulatory green light offers a sense of security and compliance that was previously missing. Institutional Trust: The involvement of established financial institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, and others lends immense credibility. These firms bring decades of experience in managing large pools of capital and adhering to stringent regulatory standards, reassuring cautious investors. Liquidity: ETFs are highly liquid, meaning they can be easily bought and sold throughout the trading day, offering flexibility that direct crypto purchases might not always provide. Diversification: For portfolio managers, Bitcoin ETFs offer a new avenue for diversification, allowing them to allocate a portion of their assets to a high-growth, uncorrelated asset class within a regulated framework. The Broader Impact: What Does This Mean for Crypto Investment? The success of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs is more than just a financial milestone; it represents a profound shift in the perception and future trajectory of crypto investment . This influx of capital from traditional finance has several far-reaching implications: Mainstream Legitimacy: The $50 billion inflow firmly cements Bitcoin’s status as a legitimate, investable asset class in the eyes of mainstream finance. This moves Bitcoin beyond niche speculation into the realm of serious portfolio consideration. Increased Market Stability: As more institutional money enters the market through regulated products, it could potentially lead to greater market stability and reduced volatility over the long term, as these investors tend to have longer holding periods. New Investor Demographics: The ETFs have opened the floodgates for a new wave of investors who previously shied away from the perceived complexities or risks of direct crypto ownership. This broadens the investor base significantly. Catalyst for Other Crypto Products: The success of Bitcoin ETFs is likely to pave the way for similar products tracking other major cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum ETFs, further integrating digital assets into traditional finance. This massive adoption signifies a turning point, transforming Bitcoin from a fringe asset into a recognized financial instrument that institutions and individuals can confidently access. Navigating the Future: Actionable Insights for Institutional Adoption The rapid rise of spot Bitcoin ETFs provides valuable insights and potential pathways for future institutional adoption within the digital asset space. For investors and market participants, understanding these dynamics is crucial: For Investors: Consider the long-term strategic allocation. While Bitcoin is volatile, its inclusion in diversified portfolios via ETFs offers a managed approach to exposure. Research different funds, their fees, and underlying structures to align with your investment goals. For Financial Advisors: Educate clients on the benefits and risks of Bitcoin ETFs. These products provide a regulated entry point for clients interested in digital assets without the complexities of direct crypto ownership. For Crypto Projects: The success of Bitcoin ETFs highlights the demand for regulated, accessible products. This could inspire the development of similar instruments for other digital assets, driving further innovation and legitimization. Regulatory Evolution: The SEC’s approval of Bitcoin ETFs signals a maturing regulatory environment. Expect continued dialogue and potential frameworks for other digital asset classes, which could unlock even more institutional capital. The journey has just begun, but the initial data clearly indicates a powerful trend towards integrating digital assets into the global financial system through regulated, accessible channels. A New Era of Digital Asset Investment The astounding $50 billion in net inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs within just 18 months is more than a headline; it’s a testament to a seismic shift in the financial world. It validates Bitcoin’s growing acceptance as a mainstream asset, driven by robust institutional interest and enhanced accessibility for all types of investors. This milestone marks a new era where digital assets are increasingly integrated into traditional financial portfolios, promising further innovation and growth in the years to come. The future of crypto investment looks brighter and more integrated than ever before.

After weeks of sideways action and uncertainty, this move marks a small but significant breakout, reigniting bullish sentiment among investors and traders. The breakout comes as Bitcoin continues to consolidate below its all-time highs, allowing ETH and other altcoins to take the lead. Related Reading: Bitcoin 30-Day Average Funding Rate Drops – Bullish Setup Takes Shape Market participants are closely watching Ethereum’s price action, as its movements often set the tone for the broader altcoin space. Top analyst Ted Pillows shared a technical view highlighting that ETH is once again trading at the top of its recent range. A breakout above this level could confirm the beginning of a larger expansion phase for altcoins. With bullish momentum building and Ethereum holding strong above reclaimed support levels, traders are becoming increasingly confident that the altcoin market may be on the verge of a broader breakout. However, key resistance still lies ahead, and the next few days will be crucial in determining whether Ethereum has the strength to continue higher and lead a new leg up in the crypto cycle. Ethereum Trades at Range Highs: Breakout Looms Ethereum has spent the past several weeks consolidating in a well-defined range between approximately $2,400 and $2,800, a structure that began forming in early May. Despite short-term volatility, ETH has held key support levels, suggesting that bulls remain in control. Now, with price action pushing toward the upper boundary of the range once again, the market is watching closely to see whether Ethereum can break through resistance and initiate a sustained rally. The broader macroeconomic backdrop has shifted in favor of risk assets. In the US, strong labor market data and wage growth have helped ease concerns of an economic slowdown. Meanwhile, the resolution of several global geopolitical tensions has reduced uncertainty, allowing markets to stabilize. This supportive environment could give Ethereum the fuel it needs to attempt a breakout. Ted Pillows recently highlighted that Ethereum is now trading at the range highs again — a level that has repeatedly capped price advances in recent months. According to Pillow, a confirmed breakout above the $2,800 resistance would likely trigger renewed momentum for ETH and potentially spark a broader move across the altcoin market. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Action Signals Momentum Shift: BTC Sleeps And ETH Moves $2,800 Resistance Now In Sight Ethereum is showing renewed strength as it breaks out of a multi-week consolidation range, with the latest 12-hour candle closing above $2,760. The price action has decisively reclaimed the $2,700 level and is now testing the critical $2,800 resistance zone. This breakout is supported by a clear surge in volume, confirming bullish momentum. The 50, 100, and 200-period moving averages are all trending upwards and currently sit well below the current price, a strong technical sign of sustained momentum. ETH has moved above all three key SMAs, confirming that bulls are in control in the short to medium term. Notably, this is the highest ETH has traded since early June, and the candle structure resembles a classic continuation breakout setup. Related Reading: ERC-20 Stablecoin Supply Hits All-Time High At $121B – Liquidity On The Rise A successful daily close above $2,800 would open the door for an expansion toward the $3,000 level and potentially higher if momentum holds. However, the key now lies in whether buyers can sustain this move without immediate rejection at resistance. If ETH can hold above $2,700 and build support, the breakout could serve as a launchpad for altcoins, especially as Ethereum often leads broader market moves.

As the stock of the AI chipmaker rose to record highs, traders and analysts are parsing whether Bitcoin is once more riding tech tailwinds—or crypto is finally going solo. Nvidia's shares hit an all-time high of $164.32, temporarily becoming the world's first $4 trillion company. The rally has been fueled by insatiable demand for AI chips, with investors seeing Nvidia as the bedrock of the artificial intelligence revolution that is now unfolding. The company's valuation is the same as the GDP of the world's most significant economies, showing the scale of the AI boom. Bitcoin and Nvidia: Correlation Data Tells a Nuanced Story For the majority of 2024 and the beginning of 2025, Bitcoin and Nvidia moved together, having correlation factors as high as 0.80 or higher—a very unusual level between disparate sectors' assets. This tight linkage reflected a broader ”risk-on” environment in which money entered crypto and AI stocks as proxies for growth and innovation. But newer figures show that the correlation is starting to weaken. While the three-month average remains reasonably healthy at 0.69, the newer figures have dropped back to around 0.36, indicating decoupling as investor interest waxes elsewhere. Of interest is the fact that Bitcoin's new all-time high of over $111,900 occurred roughly around the time of Nvidia's $4T mark, but analysts caution that this may be indicative of overall market euphoria and not a sustained trend. 2023-2024: Rolling 90-day correlation between BTC and NVDA was between 0.45-0.6, indicating moderate positive correlation. Q2 2025: Correlation has fallen below 0.3, with some weeks of near-zero or even negative readings, as Bitcoin lagged despite Nvidia moving relentlessly upwards. “Nvidia’s rally to $4 trillion might have helped BTC, but correlation is waning as macro factors and crypto-specific catalysts take over,” notes a leading digital asset strategist. The changing relationship between Nvidia and Bitcoin reflects diverging market drivers. Nvidia’s surge is powered by relentless AI demand and enterprise tech investment, while Bitcoin’s price action is increasingly shaped by macroeconomic uncertainty and crypto-specific events. As AI stocks become crowded trades, investors are rotating funds, but Bitcoin is now moving more on its own fundamentals—like halving cycles and regulatory news—than on Big Tech momentum. This marks a clear shift: Bitcoin is decoupling from the tech rally and forging an independent path. AI Chip Supply Chains: Indirect Impact on Crypto Mining Nvidia's leadership in AI chips' market share has spill-over benefits across the digital asset world, especially across crypto mining: ASIC Supply Chain Restriction: With demand for AI surging, semiconductor manufacturing facilities like TSMC and Samsung are prioritizing orders for AI chips, restricting supply chains for Bitcoin mining devices. This can lead to increased costs and longer lead times for ASIC miners, restricting profitability. Geopolitical Shifts: Tariffs and trade tensions are leading top ASIC manufacturers to set up production in the US, reshaping the global mining supply chain and even driving up miner expenses. AI-Blockchain Convergence: Mining operators are utilizing AI-driven analytics to optimize operations and supply chains, with blockchain offering transparency and traceability of hardware origins. Nvidia's $4T milestone is a testiment to the robustness of the AI bubble, but the era of Bitcoin keeping pace with Big Tech is likely behind us. As macro dynamics and crypto-native forces come into relief, investors must look for a less overt and more uncertain alignment between the world's leading AI chipmaker and the digital currency monarch.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9886/nvidia-hits-4-trillion-does-bitcoin-still-follow-tech-s-lead,"BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|MARKET|TRADING","News|Business",cryptocompare
2025-07-10T12:15:20,"Bitcoin traders race to reset expectations after surge to new all-time high","Bitcoin’s price movement to a new all-time high of $112,052 on Wednesday has made some investors re-evaluate their positions, with analysts warning that underexposed traders could be caught off guard if the rally continues. 10x Research analysts believe Bitcoin’s latest breakout could extend deep into the third quarter, reaching a price target of as high as $133,000. According to Markus Thielen, head of research at 10x Research, the firm’s Bitcoin trend model flipped bullish on June 29. The model now places a 60% probability of BTC continuing its upward market price move over the next two months. Thielen’s analysis mentions a potential 20% gain during this period, which would see Bitcoin tread upwards to $130,000 at current prices. “Bitcoin is breaking out, fueled by relentless ETF demand and a series of policy catalysts on the horizon,” Thielen wrote in a market update released Wednesday. He reiterated that many traders are underpositioned following the previous month’s option expiry, leading to a “significant exposure roll-off.” “We remain constructive,” he jotted down, explaining that current trading signals support the continuation of this bullish trend. Call option buying: Traders eyeing an upside move According to the 10x Research head, Bitcoin traders are now predominantly buying calls, which could mean there is a sentiment of being “underexposed to further upside.” Market participants may be racing to catch up with Bitcoin’s rally rather than driving it through spot buying. He also explained that the current market bull run will likely extend into September, especially if upcoming macroeconomic events become favorable. Bitcoin ETF flows – $15 billion net buying since mid-April. Source: 10xResearch In the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report scheduled for release on July 15, economists expect a “benign” CPI print to push people towards buying positions. The third quarter hasn’t always been Bitcoin’s most favorable time of the year, with an average return of just 5.84% since 2013, according to data from CoinGlass. Still, Thielen is confident this year could be an exception, citing US pro-crypto policy changes and green ETF flows. “Traders on the sidelines risk missing the move that could define this quarter,” he concluded. ETF inflows show bulls in control Even during weeks of consolidation, there was approximately $15 billion in silent accumulation through the US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs . On Wednesday alone, these ETFs attracted $215.7 million in inflows, according to data from Farside Investors. Traders previously sitting on the sidelines are seemingly being forced to re-enter the market, potentially at much higher prices. 10x Research revealed that it has entered a long position in Bitcoin at $104,000, hedged with a $115,000 call option. The core position is up by $7,000, but the option has only gained $450 because of the market’s reduced implied volatility and time decay. Still, Thielen said the trade was performing as expected and will soon transition into a higher trading range. Ethereum ETFs on a market run Ethereum surged over 5% on Wednesday, outperforming Bitcoin, Ripple, and Solana. The rally was accompanied by record trading activity in BlackRock’s spot ether ETF, ETHA, listed on Nasdaq. More than 43 million shares of ETHA changed hands on Wednesday, the highest daily volume since the fund’s debut a year ago. According to Yahoo Finance, that figure nearly doubled the previous day’s volume of 24 million. TradingView data also shows that ETHA’s 30-day average trading volume is up by 18.83 million shares, up from 12.97 million in the first week of June. Investor interest has translated into robust capital inflows, with over $1.2 billion added to the fund since June. On Tuesday alone, net inflows reached $159 million, the largest single-day total since June 11, based on SoSoValue data.

2025-07-10T12:13:40,"WIF Price Jumps 13% as Meme Coins Rally","TL;DR WIF confirms cup-and-handle breakout, pushing toward resistance at $1.031 with strong momentum. Volume and open interest surged, signaling aggressive long positions and growing trader confidence. The Fibonacci zone between $0.8550–$0.8776 forms a new demand zone for a possible retest and support. Dogwifhat Gains Amid Market Rebound Dogwifhat (WIF) was trading at $0.97 at press time, up 13.17% in the past 24 hours. The move follows Bitcoin’s new all-time high, which has improved overall market sentiment. Meme coins such as WIF, PENGU , and SPX6900 have all seen price increases as a result. WIF has also posted a 4.41% gain in the past week, with daily trading volume at $570 million. The price has fluctuated within a 24-hour range of $0.855 to $0.98 and a 7-day range of $0.82 to $0.98. The current trend shows WIF continuing its recovery, supported by bullish technical signals and increased trading activity. Cup and Handle Breakout Signals Strength Chart data confirms a breakout from a cup-and-handle pattern, a structure that often precedes upward price continuation. This breakout is supported by a golden cross between the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages, a signal that may reflect a shift toward sustained bullish pressure. Source: TradingView WIF is now approaching resistance at $1.031. Immediate support is visible around $0.9, and traders are watching whether the asset can maintain momentum above this level. The breakout from the descending handle pattern marks a strong shift in the short-term trend. Demand Zone Forms at Fibonacci Support Levels According to analyst Crypto Chiefs, the breakout leaves behind a strong demand zone between $0.8550 and $0.8776. This area coincides with the 0.618–0.75 Fibonacci retracement range. The price may revisit this zone in the event of a pullback, where buyers could step in again. $WIF – bullish break to the upside. It has left behind some strong demand around key Fibonacci levels which look interesting. pic.twitter.com/lg2tdwBpvA — Crypto Chiefs (@cryptochiefss) July 10, 2025 Consequently, these levels are being monitored closely for confirmation of sustained upward price action. As long as WIF holds above this support area, the outlook remains favorable for further upside. Data from Coinglass shows that WIF futures open interest has increased by 18%, reaching $480 million. At the same time, trading volume surged 85% to $2.41 billion. The rise in open interest alongside price movement suggests new long positions are entering the market.

2025-07-10T12:10:25,"Unlocking Crucial Bitcoin Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios","In the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, understanding market sentiment is paramount for any trader. One of the most powerful indicators for gauging this sentiment, especially for the flagship digital asset, is the BTC perpetual futures long-short ratio. This ratio provides a snapshot of how traders are positioning themselves – whether they expect Bitcoin’s price to rise (long) or fall (short). Let’s dive into the latest 24-hour data and uncover what these crucial numbers tell us about the current state of Bitcoin trading . What Are Long-Short Ratios and Why Do They Matter? Before we dissect the latest figures, it’s essential to grasp what long-short ratios represent. Simply put, this ratio compares the number of long positions (bets on price increase) to short positions (bets on price decrease) on perpetual futures contracts. Perpetual futures are a type of derivative that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without an expiry date, making them highly popular in the crypto space. Why is this data so vital for your crypto market analysis ? Here are a few reasons: Sentiment Indicator: A high long ratio suggests bullish sentiment, while a high short ratio indicates bearishness. Potential Reversals: Extreme imbalances in the ratio can sometimes signal a potential market reversal. For instance, an overwhelmingly long position might lead to a cascade of liquidations if the price unexpectedly drops. Liquidity and Open Interest: These ratios are often viewed in conjunction with open interest (the total number of outstanding derivative contracts) to get a fuller picture of market depth and potential volatility. Deep Dive into 24-Hour BTC Perpetual Futures Data Over the past 24 hours, the overall sentiment across various cryptocurrency exchanges shows a slight lean towards long positions for BTC perpetual futures . This indicates that more traders are currently betting on a price increase for Bitcoin than a decrease. Let’s look at the aggregated data and then break it down by top exchanges: Total Market Overview (Past 24 Hours): Position Type Percentage Long 51.56% Short 48.44% This marginal preference for long positions suggests a cautiously optimistic outlook among the broader trading community. It’s not an overwhelming bullish sentiment, but rather a slight tilt that could be interpreted in various ways, depending on other market factors. Exchange-Specific Insights: What Do Top Platforms Reveal About Bitcoin Trading ? While the aggregated data gives us a general idea, examining individual exchange data provides a more nuanced understanding of where specific trading activity and sentiment are concentrated. The top three exchanges in terms of volume and open interest often dictate broader market trends. Top Three Exchanges – 24-Hour Long-Short Ratios: Exchange Long Percentage Short Percentage Binance 52.67% 47.33% Bybit 50.34% 49.66% Gate.io 51.62% 48.38% Binance: Leading the Charge with a Bullish Bias Binance, being the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, often sets the tone for the market. Its long-short ratio of 52.67% long to 47.33% short indicates a slightly stronger bullish sentiment among its user base compared to the overall market average. This suggests that a significant portion of active traders on Binance are anticipating a positive price movement for Bitcoin. Bybit: A More Balanced Perspective Bybit’s figures show a much more balanced distribution, with 50.34% long and 49.66% short. This near 50/50 split indicates a more cautious or indecisive stance among Bybit traders. It could mean that while some are going long, an almost equal number are hedging their bets or actively shorting, reflecting a high degree of uncertainty or consolidation within that platform’s trading community. Gate.io: Mirroring the Market Average Gate.io’s ratio of 51.62% long to 48.38% short closely mirrors the overall market average. This suggests that traders on Gate.io are largely aligned with the broader sentiment observed across all exchanges, indicating a moderate bullish lean but not an aggressive one. Interpreting the Futures Trading Data : What Does It All Mean? The consistent slight bias towards long positions across these major exchanges, with none showing an overwhelming majority in either direction, paints a picture of cautious optimism. It suggests that while there’s underlying confidence in Bitcoin’s future price action, traders are not blindly rushing into long positions. This measured approach can be healthy for the market, preventing extreme overleveraging that could lead to sharp corrections. Key takeaways from this futures trading data : No Extreme Imbalance: The ratios are not heavily skewed, which is generally a good sign. Extreme long or short positions can often precede liquidations and rapid price movements. Slight Bullish Edge: The slight dominance of long positions suggests that the market believes in a positive trajectory for Bitcoin in the short term, albeit with reservations. Divergence in Sentiment: While the overall trend is similar, the slight differences between exchanges highlight that different trading communities might have varying levels of conviction. Actionable Insights for Your Crypto Market Analysis How can you use this information to refine your trading strategies? While long-short ratios are powerful, they should always be considered alongside other indicators like funding rates, open interest, volume, and technical analysis. Here are some actionable insights: Confirmation Tool: Use these ratios to confirm your existing biases. If your analysis suggests a bullish move and the long-short ratio supports it, it adds conviction to your trade. Warning Signal: If you see extreme long ratios (e.g., 70%+) without significant price movement, it might be a sign of overleveraging. A sudden price drop could trigger a cascade of liquidations, pushing the price down further. Contrarian Play: Sometimes, going against the crowd can be profitable. If the ratio is overwhelmingly long, a contrarian trader might look for signs of a short squeeze or a sudden reversal. Exchange-Specific Strategies: If you trade predominantly on one exchange, pay closer attention to its specific long-short ratio. The sentiment on Binance might differ slightly from Bybit, influencing your short-term decisions on that platform. Remember, no single indicator provides a complete picture. Integrating BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios into a broader analytical framework will yield the best results for your Bitcoin trading decisions. Conclusion: Navigating the Nuances of Bitcoin Trading Sentiment The 24-hour long-short ratios for BTC perpetual futures offer a fascinating glimpse into the collective psyche of Bitcoin traders. The current data points to a moderately bullish, yet cautious, sentiment across major exchanges. While the slight lean towards long positions suggests underlying confidence, the absence of extreme imbalance indicates a healthy market that is not overly leveraged in one direction. For anyone engaged in futures trading data analysis, these ratios are an indispensable tool for understanding market sentiment and potential price movements. By monitoring these figures alongside other technical and fundamental indicators, traders can make more informed decisions, navigate market volatility with greater confidence, and potentially unlock significant opportunities in the ever-evolving crypto landscape.

BIT Mining said it wants to ""capture emerging opportunities across the broader blockchain"" industry and attract investors seeking exposure to Solana in an announcement on Thursday . The company's New York Stock Exchange-listed shares soared as high as $11.20 in pre-market trading, over 350% compared to Wendesday's closing price of $2.46, following the announcement. At press time, BTCM was trading nearly 250% higher at $8.38.

2025-07-10T12:04:55,"Bitcoin ETFs Hit $50B Milestone as Institutional Inflows Surge","The post Bitcoin ETFs Hit $50B Milestone as Institutional Inflows Surge appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Institutional interest in Bitcoin continues to soar , and spot Bitcoin ETFs are leading the charge. Just 18 months after their launch in January 2024, these investment products have now attracted over $50 billion in net inflows. The strong demand reflects growing confidence from big-money players, and the rally shows no signs of slowing down. $218M Inflows in a Day On July 9 alone, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $218 million in net inflows, marking the fifth straight day of gains. According to SoSoValue data , nearly $1.52 billion has poured into these funds over the past five trading days. This follows a brief setback at the start of the month, when outflows hit $342 million on July 1. Since then, investor appetite has surged, with daily inflows peaking at $601.94 million on July 3. BlackRock Leads the Pack With Over 700K BTC BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) remains the dominant player, holding over 700,000 BTC, more than 55% of all Bitcoin held in U.S. spot ETFs. The fund has attracted $53 billion in net inflows, far ahead of Fidelity’s FBTC, which holds $12.29 billion. In contrast, Grayscale’s GBTC continues to see outflows, losing $23.34 billion since its conversion. IBIT has even become BlackRock’s third-largest revenue-generating ETF, surpassing some of its long-standing traditional products, according to NovaDius Wealth Management’s Nate Geraci. The nearly $75bil iShares Bitcoin ETF has only one month of outflows since Jan 2024 launch… Now generates more fee revenue for BlackRock than its largest ETF, the iShares S&P 500 ETF.

A broader crypto index ETF could also be approved soon, offering more access to altcoins for traditional investors. Meanwhile, apart from Bitcoin ETFs, Ethereum also saw momentum, with its ETFs pulling in over $211 million in a single day, pushing their total net inflows to nearly $5 billion. These flows suggest a broader appetite for crypto exposure among traditional investors. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ethereum ETF Inflows Cross $320M, Is a Major ETH Price Rally Ahead? , Why Are Institutions Investing? Crypto analyst Rachael Lucas says this is not your typical retail hype cycle. Instead, it’s large-scale investors, asset managers, corporate treasuries, and wealth platforms moving in. The consistency of inflows across recent months (April, May, June) supports the view that Bitcoin is being taken seriously as a long-term investment. Lucas says global tensions and Trump’s push for rate cuts are making Bitcoin more attractive. According to him, the timing is different now because ETFs make it easier and safer to invest, just like buying stocks. Plus, the delay in Trump’s tariffs is also helping crypto prices rise. Bitcoin Enters Corporate Treasuries Beyond ETFs, companies are also jumping in. Japan’s Metaplanet added $237 million in BTC, while other firms in France and the UK made multi-million-dollar purchases. Tokyo-listed Remixpoint raised $215 million to buy 3,000 BTC. Meanwhile, Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $112,000 , and Ether surged 6.6% to $2,778, with analysts eyeing a breakout past $3,000. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

He shared a chart on X with a potential reversal point, suggesting that ETH could skyrocket. At the moment, Ethereum is sitting at around $2784 . This isn’t the first time Hayes has been talking optimistically about Ethereum, especially in recent months. In late May, he called Ethereum the “most hated Layer-1” , saying that it’s usually best to be in the most hated asset at the turn of the cycle. Hayes then predicted that at the very least, ETH could reach a new all-time high this year.

This move has reignited bullish sentiment among traders. Experts closely monitoring now believe, after witnessing this surge, that another surge could propel the price of XRP to higher levels. This optimism is supported as its parent company, Ripple, enjoys a series of positive developments, and experts now believe that its price action has led to the emergence of a new inverse head and shoulders pattern, which may indicate a long-term potential reversal in the near future. Moreover, the investor sentiment has also shifted to a more bullish outlook, with many anticipating that XRP would continue its upward trajectory and aim for a higher target by the end of July. Analyst Targets $3.30 In XRP Price Crypto analyst TheSignalyst recently highlighted that the XRP price has entered an Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern. This formation has emerged at a crucial moment, coinciding with strong support levels which were maintained by bullish traders for several months. As of now, Bitcoin has also surpassed its June high, and XRP crypto is riding on that momentum, having climbed to $2.45. The analyst notes that in the short term, the price could reach between $2.62 and $2.66. Looking ahead, TheSignalyst displays that a decisive break above the $2.66 level is essential for confirming a bullish continuation. If this setup holds, the analyst projects that the XRP price could potentially reach as high as $3.30 in the long term. Indicators Analysis Shows Bullish Strength The XRP price is demonstrating notable bullish strength, with today’s momentum highlighted by several bullish indicators. The MACD has revealed a golden cross, with the histogram rising at 0.0277. Currently, the MACD line sits at 0.0440, while the signal line is at 0.0164. In addition, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) supports this bullish sentiment, as its histogram has also climbed at 0.1196. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also indicates positive trends, currently jumping from 0 line to 0.11, reflecting an increase in money inflows. Moreover, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is on the rise, inching closer to overbought territory at 67.48. This suggests a strong likelihood of another price spike in the short-term before the market becomes overheated.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/can-xrp-price-reach-3-30-by-month-end/,"TRADING|XRP|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BTC","Price Analysis|Altcoins|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare
2025-07-10T11:50:42,"Bitcoin Depot Discloses Data Breach Impacting 27K Users After Law Enforcement Delay","Bitcoin Depot has informed nearly 27,000 customers about a data breach that occurred over a year ago, following directions from federal authorities to withhold disclosure due to an active investigation. The crypto ATM operator filed notice with the attorneys general of Maine and Massachusetts on Monday, revealing that an “external system breach” on June 23, 2024, exposed user data belonging to 26,732 customers. A spokesperson for Bitcoin Depot stated that law enforcement had advised the company to delay notifying customers while an investigation into the third party responsible was underway. On June 13, federal authorities informed Bitcoin Depot that the investigation was complete, clearing the company to proceed with disclosure. Bitcoin Depot User Data Exposed The breach involved sensitive customer data, including names, phone numbers, driver’s license numbers, and potentially addresses, birth dates, and emails, the company disclosed in its notice. Despite the exposure of this personal information, Bitcoin Depot emphasized that there is “no evidence of customer information being misused.” “Bitcoin Depot remains committed to protecting customer data and privacy,” the spokesperson said. Customers have been advised to monitor their credit reports, report suspicious activity, and consider placing fraud alerts or security freezes with credit agencies to reduce the risk of identity theft or fraudulent activities. The company explained that it detected unusual activity within its network in June 2024 and immediately launched an investigation with a leading cybersecurity firm. By July 18, 2024, the investigation confirmed that an unauthorized party had accessed files containing customer information. Bitcoin Depot has since enhanced its security measures, implemented stricter monitoring, and increased staff awareness around data protection. Broader Industry Faces Persistent Threats The crypto industry remains a lucrative target for hackers, with attacks on crypto exchanges and service providers becoming frequent. Earlier this year, Coinbase was targeted by hackers who bribed third-party contractors to access customer data, later rejecting a $20 million ransom demand when attackers leaked the data. In December, another crypto ATM operator, Byte Federal, reported a breach potentially affecting 58,000 customers after attackers exploited a third-party software vulnerability. Although no customer funds were reported stolen in these incidents, they highlight the persistent security challenges within the crypto and fintech sectors. Bitcoin Depot stated it is continuing to cooperate with law enforcement to address the incident and prevent future occurrences, underscoring the importance of robust cybersecurity practices in safeguarding user data in the evolving crypto landscape.

2025-07-10T11:50:18,"ETH futures displace BTC volume as traders shift sentiment toward Ethereum","Trader focus is shifting, causing one of the rare occasions when Ethereum futures activity outpaces BTC. The trade signals a shift in sentiment, breaking the streak of ETH being considered an underperforming asset. Trader focus is shifting toward Ethereum, as ETH futures volumes overtook Bitcoin. BTC returned to its spot as the leader soon after, but the increased trading signals a shift for ETH sentiment and a possible trader rotation. #Ethereum just flipped #Bitcoin in 24h futures volume: $62.1B vs $61.7B! That’s rare – and it signals a potential rotation in trader focus and positioning ahead of possible $ETH -specific catalysts. pic.twitter.com/34XlbZgimQ — glassnode (@glassnode) July 10, 2025 Based on Glassnode data , ETH futures expanded to $62.1B for 24-hour volumes, while BTC achieved $61.7B. ETH volumes soon slowed down to $61.7B for the day, still close behind BTC. Liquidations were also more active for Ethereum based on the current trader positioning. Spot volumes for ETH are at around $28B per day, with $40B for BTC. The leading coin still dominates the market, with over $34B in open interest and around $18B for ETH. While BTC open interest remained largely unchanged, ETH positions nearly doubled from recent lows, showing traders have not capitulated. ETH recovers $2,800, still unable to make a bigger move The next step for Ethereum may include factors specific to the chain, especially DeFi growth and stablecoin traffic. For now, ETH managed to break above $2,800, but is yet to show additional strength to recover above $3,000. ETH traded at $2,777.40, after taking a step backward. In the past week, ETH recovered against BTC, rising to 0.025 BTC. However, for the year to date, ETH lost 29% of its value against BTC. A shift in sentiment may anticipate a trend reversal, where ETH activity increases to tap a more dramatic price move. One of the potential scenarios includes gaining against BTC, or a hike to the $3,000 or $4,000 level. However, ETH currently sees most of its derivative liquidity in long positions, starting at around $2,600. The recent rally may reverse to liquidate those positions. Based on trader positioning on Binance, ETH has mostly finished liquidating the long positions. In the past 24 hours, traders were liquidated for $157.9M in short positions. Following the large daily liquidation event, traders turned to attacking long positions. Ethereum may see renewed buying pressure Until recently, ETH fell due to combined selling pressure from whales and from the reserves of Grayscale . Recently, Grayscale started re-accumulating ETH, along with other funds. ETH is also accumulating in whale wallets with 10,000 or more tokens. Mega-whale wallets now hold over 41M ETH, after months of slow and mostly invisible accumulation. Around 30% of the ETH supply is staked in the Beacon Chain contract. Ethereum is also getting accumulated in corporate treasuries, following a similar path to BTC. In any case, ETH is seen as valuable and as the central chain for decentralized finance and stablecoins. The expectations for an ETH rally may also reawaken altcoins , leading to a breakout season in the second half of 2025. The Ethereum narrative is also abandoning the recent capitulation and the expectations that the chain will be useless and abandoned. Ethereum remains a DeFi lending leader, compensating for the loss of meme tokens, gaming tokens and other Web3 trends from the 2021 bull market.

2025-07-10T11:50:17,"Bhutan Bitcoin Strategy: Unveiling a Pivotal $23.61M BTC Transfer to Binance","A ripple of intrigue has spread through the cryptocurrency world. Just moments ago, the Royal Government of Bhutan executed a significant Bitcoin transfer, moving 212.31 BTC, valued at an astonishing $23.61 million, to the global exchange giant Binance. This isn’t an isolated incident; over the past ten days, Bhutan has consistently channeled its digital assets, depositing a total of 350.74 BTC worth approximately $38.5 million into the exchange. This latest move by the Himalayan kingdom spotlights a unique approach to digital asset management and prompts us to delve deeper into Bhutan’s fascinating Bhutan Bitcoin Strategy . Unpacking Bhutan’s Unique Bhutan Bitcoin Strategy For many, the idea of a sovereign nation actively managing a substantial Bitcoin portfolio might seem surprising. Yet, Bhutan, a country often associated with its Gross National Happiness philosophy and pristine natural beauty, has quietly emerged as a pioneering force in the realm of state-sponsored cryptocurrency adoption. Their journey into Bitcoin isn’t new; reports suggest they began mining Bitcoin as early as 2019, leveraging their abundant hydropower resources – a clean, sustainable energy source perfectly suited for energy-intensive mining operations. The nation’s digital asset ventures are primarily managed by Druk Holdings and Investments (DHI), the commercial arm of the Royal Government. DHI acts as a sovereign wealth fund, holding and managing the government’s assets across various sectors, including energy, communication, and now, digital currencies. This strategic diversification into Bitcoin is seen not just as an investment but as a long-term play to future-proof the nation’s economy and explore new revenue streams. Sustainable Mining: Utilizing surplus hydropower for eco-friendly Bitcoin mining. Sovereign Wealth Management: DHI integrates Bitcoin into its diversified portfolio. Long-Term Vision: A forward-thinking approach to national economic resilience. Understanding the Broader Landscape of Government Crypto Holdings Bhutan is not alone in its exploration of digital assets, though its quiet, strategic approach sets it apart. The concept of government crypto holdings has gained significant traction globally, driven by various motivations: Country/Entity Motivation for Crypto Holdings Examples El Salvador National Currency, Remittances, Tourism Made Bitcoin legal tender, launched Volcano Bonds. Ukraine War Funding, Humanitarian Aid Accepted crypto donations during conflict. United States Seized Assets, Law Enforcement Holds large amounts of BTC from illicit activities. Various Nations Innovation, Reserves, Diversification Exploring CBDCs, holding small amounts for research. While some nations, like El Salvador, have made bold public statements about their Bitcoin adoption, others, like Bhutan, have preferred a more discreet, calculated path. This highlights a growing trend where governments are no longer just regulating crypto but are actively participating in the digital asset ecosystem, albeit with varying degrees of transparency and strategic intent. However, holding significant amounts of volatile assets like Bitcoin comes with its own set of challenges. These include: Price Volatility: The inherent price swings of Bitcoin can impact portfolio value. Security Concerns: Safeguarding large digital holdings from hacks and cyber threats. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies. Public Perception: Managing public and international opinion on state-backed crypto ventures. The Implications of a Large Bitcoin Exchange Transfer to Binance The recent movement of 212.31 BTC, following previous deposits, directly to Binance, a major centralized exchange, is a particularly noteworthy aspect of Bhutan’s recent activity. A large Bitcoin exchange transfer like this can signal several possibilities: Liquidity Needs: The government might be preparing to sell a portion of its holdings to fund national projects, diversify into other assets, or manage its treasury. Moving funds to an exchange makes them readily available for trading. Portfolio Rebalancing: DHI might be rebalancing its portfolio, perhaps reducing its Bitcoin exposure or shifting funds to other digital assets supported by Binance. Custodial Services: While less likely for such large amounts if the intent is long-term holding, it could indicate a shift in custodial strategy, though self-custody is often preferred for sovereign entities. Market Signal: Large transfers to exchanges are often watched by traders as they can precede selling pressure, though the overall market impact from Bhutan’s moves might be limited given Bitcoin’s vast liquidity. Binance, as the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, offers deep liquidity and a wide range of trading pairs, making it a logical choice for executing large transactions. The decision to use a centralized exchange rather than over-the-counter (OTC) desks could imply a need for immediate liquidity or a preference for the exchange’s specific features. Leveraging On-chain Analytics to Track Bhutan’s BTC Movement The ability to track such significant transactions stems from the inherent transparency of the Bitcoin blockchain. This is where on-chain analytics plays a crucial role. Tools and platforms, like Onchain Lens on X (formerly Twitter), analyze publicly available blockchain data to identify and interpret large movements of digital assets. How do on-chain analysts track these movements? Public Ledger: Every Bitcoin transaction is recorded on a public, immutable ledger. Address Tracing: Analysts identify wallets associated with known entities (like governments or large institutions) and track funds moving from these addresses. Exchange Wallets: Major exchanges have identifiable “hot” and “cold” wallets. When funds move into these, it’s often a precursor to trading activity. Volume and Frequency: Large, frequent transfers to exchanges are flagged as significant events, indicating potential market-moving actions. This transparency is a double-edged sword for governments. While it allows for public accountability and verifiable transactions, it also exposes their financial movements to global scrutiny. For Bhutan, this means their strategic decisions in the crypto space are open for interpretation by the wider market and crypto community. What’s Next for Bhutan’s Digital Asset Journey? The recent Bhutan BTC movement to Binance raises questions about the kingdom’s future plans for its digital assets. Will we see further divestment, or is this merely a tactical repositioning? Given Bhutan’s measured approach, it’s unlikely to be a hasty decision. Instead, it likely reflects a calculated step within their broader economic strategy. Possible future scenarios include: Continued Portfolio Management: Regular rebalancing and optimization of their digital asset holdings based on market conditions and national needs. Diversification Beyond Bitcoin: Exploring other cryptocurrencies or blockchain-based investments that align with their sustainable development goals. Integration into National Economy: Potentially using blockchain technology for land records, supply chain management, or even a national digital currency (CBDC) in the future. Increased Transparency: As Bhutan gains more experience, they might opt for greater transparency regarding their crypto strategy, potentially inspiring other nations. Bhutan’s journey serves as a compelling case study for how a small nation can strategically engage with the rapidly evolving world of digital finance. Their blend of environmental consciousness with technological foresight offers valuable lessons for other governments considering similar ventures. Conclusion: Bhutan’s Bold Digital Horizon The Royal Government of Bhutan’s recent significant Bitcoin transfers to Binance underscore its pioneering role in state-level crypto adoption. Far from a fleeting experiment, Bhutan’s Bhutan Bitcoin Strategy , rooted in sustainable energy and long-term vision, positions it as a quiet leader in the digital asset space. These movements, meticulously tracked through on-chain analytics , highlight the growing importance of government crypto holdings and the strategic implications of a large Bitcoin exchange transfer . As the world watches, Bhutan continues to navigate the complexities of digital finance with a unique blend of prudence and innovation, setting a compelling precedent for sovereign engagement with the future of money.

The decentralized prediction platform Kalshi says that based on the price of recent trades, the US national debt is now forecasted to grow from about $36 trillion to $46 trillion by 2029. The site has also added a live US debt tracker to its website. “Both Democrats and Republicans have failed to curb government spending… Now you can watch the national debt grow live on Kalshi.” The Kobeissi Letter, a newsletter about global markets, says that if the US debt reaches $46 trillion, it would be “officially up +100% since 2020” and warns of dire consequences. “On our current fiscal path, US bankruptcy is simply a matter of time. Something must change.” Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, has also been warning of severe economic and financial consequences as the US national debt is now on pace to rise from about $230,000 per American household to $425,000 per American household over the next decade. Dalio believes the remedy is to cut spending and raise taxes to lower the annual deficit to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio. “This printing and devaluing is not good for those holding bonds as a storehold of wealth, and what’s bad for bonds and US credit markets is bad for everyone because the US Treasury market is the backbone of all capital markets, which are the backbones of our economic and social conditions. Unless this path is soon rectified to bring the budget deficit from roughly 7% of GDP to about 3% by making adjustments to spending, taxes, and interest rates, big, painful disruptions will likely occur.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-10T11:44:40,"RCADE Network down 30% a day after Binance Alpha and Bitget listings","RCADE, the native token of the Arbitrum Layer 3 gaming-focused RCADE Network, experienced a sharp price drop following its listing on major cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance Alpha and Bitget. On July 9, RCADE was officially listed on Binance Alpha, Binance’s early-access listing portal, marking the token’s TGE. It was quickly followed by spot listings on Gate.io, KuCoin, Bithumb, and Bitget. Despite the high-profile rollout, RCADE faced sharp downward pressure in the immediate aftermath. Following its TGE, RCADE opened at an initial price of $0.0029 but declined by more than 30%, hitting an intraday low of $0.0018 on July 10. The sharp sell-off is consistent with a broader pattern seen in early-stage token launches, where airdrop recipients and early unlocks trigger short-term selling pressure. Notably, 19.38% of RCADE’s total 40 billion token supply was designated for community initiatives, such as airdrops and incentive programs, most of which were fully unlocked at launch, increasing circulating supply and likely contributing to the immediate price drop. Despite the initial decline, RCADE has since shown signs of recovery. As of the latest available data, the token rebounded to $0.0020, suggesting that market participants with long-term confidence in the project’s fundamentals are beginning to accumulate.

In contrast to RCADE’s volatile debut, Tanssi Network (TANSSI), which was also listed on Binance Alpha on the same day, managed to sustain gains of over 25% as of press time. What is RCADE Network? RCADE Network is a custom Arbitrum Layer 3 gaming infrastructure developed by Revolving Games, a Web3 studio known for titles like War of Nova and Skyborne: Phoenix Flight. Purpose-built for seamless GameFi experiences, RCADE enables low-cost, high-speed in-game transactions across its interconnected ecosystem. RCADE serves as the utility and governance token of the network, powering validator staking, node emissions, gameplay rewards, and protocol-level governance. The token is also used for in-game purchases and ecosystem fees. Read more: Solana at critical decision point: will SOL breakout to $176 or tumble to $131?

2025-07-10T11:43:14,"Data of 27,000 Bitcoin Depot customers exposed in massive breach","The crypto ATM operator kept the leak quiet for over a year, citing federal procedures and law enforcement investigations. According to a recent filing with the Maine Attorney General’s office, the breach was first detected on June 23, 2024, when Bitcoin Depot identified suspicious activity on its information systems. The firm deployed an investigation in response, engaging third-party security experts to determine the extent of the breach. On July 18, 2024, the investigation confirmed that a hacker had accessed documents containing the personal data of 26,732 customers. The stolen information included names, phone numbers, and driver’s license numbers. In some cases, it also included home addresses, birth dates, and email addresses. Bitcoin Depot said it was unable to notify affected users earlier due to an ongoing federal investigation. The disclosure hold was only lifted on June 13, 2025, when law enforcement confirmed that their investigation had concluded. You might also like: US crypto ATM operator Bitcoin Depot adds $5m in BTC to treasury The company emphasized that there is no evidence so far that the exposed data has been misused, and is offering support to affected individuals. It has also implemented new security measures, improved system monitoring, and increased internal awareness to help prevent future incidents. Users are advised to stay vigilant over the next 12 to 24 months and urged to monitor financial accounts, review credit reports, and report any suspicious activity or signs of identity theft immediately. The breach comes amid a wave of targeted attacks on crypto service providers, as threat actors continue to evolve their tactics to prey on unsuspecting individuals and entities. It echoes a similar December 2024 breach on rival crypto ATM operator Byte Federal, which exposed personal data of more than 58,000 users. Bitcoin Depot is currently the largest crypto ATM operator in the United States, with a network of over 8,000 kiosks nationwide.

At the time of publication, BTC was trading at $111,190, up 1.91% on the day with $62.3 billion in 24-hour volume. BTC 7-day chart. Source: Finbold The breakout triggered over $200 million in short liquidations and marked a key technical milestone. According to technical analyst Rich Ross from Evercore, Bitcoin is “coiled like a spring,” with potential upside targets ranging from $140,000 to $170,000. JUST IN: Bitcoin chart is ""coiled like a spring"" with upside to $170,000. pic.twitter.com/c7emsBEOQT — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) July 10, 2025 Bullish momentum was sparked in part by geopolitical events, particularly U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement of sweeping new tariffs. The administration is set to implement up to 40% tariffs on imports from Malaysia, Kazakhstan, South Africa, Myanmar, and Laos, and raise Japan’s tariff rate to 25% starting August 1. As trade tensions rise, Bitcoin continues to solidify its role as a macro hedge and digital store of value. Key BTC technical breakout confirmed Market structure has supported the rally. As noted by analyst Michael van de Poppe in a July 10 chart update, Bitcoin’s price action accelerated sharply after breaking above the $106,500 resistance level, a move that opened the door for price action to reach $108,000 and beyond. Liquidity clusters between $105,000 and $106,500 have been cleared, and the next leg of upward momentum hinges on maintaining support above that zone. https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1943210330487951416 “Liquidity has been taken, slight pullback before the big breakout to ATH,” van de Poppe observed, highlighting the $105,797 region as a key threshold. He also marked sub-$100K as a potential reaccumulation zone in the event of a deeper correction, but overall market sentiment remains strongly bullish. Bitcoin long-term bullish setup This latest all-time high also puts Bitcoin up nearly 90% year-over-year. Notably, while Bitcoin price has reached a new high, the overall crypto market cap remains under its previous peak of $3.73 trillion set in December 2024. Institutional demand remains a major tailwind. Spot ETF flows have continued to rise, and investor appetite shows no signs of slowing. In parallel, the U.S. macro environment, including inflation concerns, rate cut expectations, and now tariff shocks is creating ideal conditions for further Bitcoin strength. As BTC continues to consolidate above $110,000, traders and analysts are watching closely for confirmation of a clean breakout toward $120,000 and beyond.

2025-07-10T11:39:37,"BRETT price eyes breakout as price surges 15% amid market-wide rally","BRETT price has rallied 15%, now testing key resistance at the upper trendline of a descending channel, eyeing a potential move towards $0.085. Brett ( BRETT ) price has surged over 15% in the past 24 hours, currently trading at $0.0512 as it tests the upper trendline resistance of the descending channel it has been trading within since early May. The price has also broken above the 20-day EMA for the first time in weeks, which is a signal of building bullish momentum. This breakout attempt, combined with rising volume, suggests a potential trend reversal may be underway. The current descending channel also appears to be part of a bullish Cup and Handle formation. If BRETT price manages to break and close above the upper boundary of the descending channel — $0.051–$0.052 — it would open the door for a measured move toward $0.85., which corresponds to the height of the channel projected from the breakout point. This level also aligns with the second major swing high within the channel. Source: TradingView You might also like: TRUMP hops to Tron, deepening ties between MAGA memecoins and Justin Sun However, the technical picture becomes even more compelling when the descending channel is seen as the handle of a larger Cup and Handle pattern. Should the price confirm a breakout above the handle, it could set the stage for a larger upside move toward ~$0.148 if the price breaks out of the cup’s rim. The momentum indicators support the bullish case, with the MACD line above signal line, accompanied by a green histogram. The RSI is at 57, indicating moderate bullish momentum without being overbought, leaving room for the price to move higher before hitting resistance levels typically associated with overextension. BRETT’s surge is happening alongside a broader crypto market rally, with Bitcoin ( BTC ) recently hitting a new all-time high just shy of $112,000. Other memecoins like Popcat ( POPCAT ), Aixbt ( AIXBT ), and Pudgy Penguins ( PENGU ) are also posting double-digit gains in the past 24 hours.

The rally followed a key regulatory milestone: the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officially acknowledged a proposed exchange-traded fund (ETF) that would hold both PENGU tokens and Pudgy Penguins non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The SEC’s notice , issued under Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act, confirmed it is considering Cboe BZX Exchange’s application to list the Canary PENGU ETF. The move has prompted renewed market enthusiasm, reinforcing PENGU’s standing among altcoins with rising institutional exposure. Canary PENGU ETF structure ties tokens and NFTs The proposed Canary PENGU ETF introduces a dual-asset structure that allocates between 80% and 95% of the fund’s holdings to PENGU tokens and 5% to 15% to Pudgy Penguins NFTs. This blend of digital assets offers investors exposure to both the meme coin and its associated NFT collection. Canary Capital first submitted the S1 filing for the fund in March. A follow-up 19b-4 was filed by Cboe BZX on June 25 and later amended twice, with the most recent update filed on July 8. The ETF, if approved, would trade under the Commodity-Based Trust Shares category per Cboe BZX Rule 14.11(e)(4). It represents a rare combination of fungible and non-fungible blockchain assets in a single listed product, a strategy not yet approved for any other altcoin ETF by the SEC. SEC opens public comment window on PENGU ETF Following the acknowledgement, the SEC has now opened a 21-day public comment window, beginning after the filing’s publication in the Federal Register. This phase does not imply approval but is a required step before a final decision can be made. While Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have been cleared under the Trump administration’s more crypto-friendly SEC, no altcoin or meme coin ETF has received formal approval to date. However, the SEC has shown willingness to consider applications, and the PENGU filing is among the few currently under active review. The ETF notice has had a measurable market impact. PENGU’s price spiked immediately following the SEC’s acknowledgement, making it the top daily gainer on CoinGecko at the time of writing. The token’s performance mirrors earlier rallies in March and June, when initial filings triggered similar surges. Technical signals and ETF interest drive sentiment Traders and market watchers have identified a cup-and-handle formation in PENGU’s price chart, a common bullish continuation pattern. This setup suggests the possibility of further gains if resistance levels are broken. PENGU has now emerged as one of the few meme coins with a path to ETF market exposure. The combination of technical bullish signals and a regulatory event has driven investor speculation that the token could become a leader in its category during the current cycle. The price movement also comes amid a broader trend of altcoins attempting to gain institutional legitimacy through regulated products. PENGU’s rally is being closely watched as a potential test case for crypto ETFs that move beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, especially given the inclusion of NFTs in its structure. Though the final outcome of the ETF proposal remains uncertain, the price response highlights growing confidence among retail and institutional investors in tokenised products that link fungible and non-fungible digital assets.

Musk’s AI Claims to Beat GPT-5, Stirs Controversy appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Elon Musk has just launched Grok 4 , the newest version of xAI’s chatbot and he’s making a bold claim: it’s smarter than PhDs in every field. The announcement has sparked both excitement and controversy. While Musk says Grok 4 marks a major leap in artificial intelligence, the bot’s rollout has already hit a few bumps. At $300 a month, the stakes are high and so are expectations. Releasing @Grok 4 from @xAI https://t.co/SYJbxJySSR — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 10, 2025 Is This Just Marketing Hype? At the livestreamed launch, Musk boldly declared , “ Grok 4 is postgraduate, like PhD level, in everything. Better than a PhD .” He admitted it might miss some common-sense cues but insisted, “Most PhDs would fail where Grok 4 would pass.” Available under a new $300/month “Pro” plan on X, Grok 4 gives users access to advanced reasoning, coding help, academic-grade conversations and even tools to create video games. Musk hinted it could start discovering new technologies by the end of 2025 and possibly uncover new physics in the next two years. Built on a Supercomputer, Designed to Compete Grok 4 was trained using xAI’s Colossus supercomputer in Memphis. The upgraded version includes better reasoning, real-time internet browsing through DeepSearch, and new multimodal features like image input. There’s also a developer-focused version called Grok 4 Code , which competes with GitHub Copilot and OpenAI’s Code Interpreter. It helps users write, debug, and explain code, positioning itself as a serious tool for programmers. Controversy Hits Before the Official Launch Just days before the release, Grok’s official X account posted antisemitic remarks including praise for Hitler and comments targeting Jewish executives in Hollywood. The backlash was swift, with criticism from users and groups like the Anti-Defamation League. xAI deleted the posts and removed a section in Grok’s system prompt that encouraged “politically incorrect” responses. While the company promised to take steps to prevent hate speech, Musk stayed silent. His vision of Grok as a “non-woke” alternative to ChatGPT and Gemini has raised concerns about the platform’s guardrails. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Jack Ma’s Ant Group Joins Circle to Bring USDC to Blockchain , Leadership Shakeup Adds More Questions The Grok 4 drama comes as Musk’s platform X faces its own crisis. CEO Linda Yaccarino stepped down on July 9, the same day Grok 4 was announced. There’s no successor yet, and no clear plan, adding more uncertainty to the already fragile situation. Still, Musk seems unfazed. He called the launch a “Big Bang Intelligence” moment and claimed Grok 4 outperforms models like GPT-5 and Claude 4 Opus. “We’ve run out of test questions to ask,” he said. “Reality is the ultimate reasoning test.” Can Grok 4 Deliver? Elon Musk is elated with the launch and believes that it will outshine its rival to claim the top spot. With xAI reportedly spending $1 billion monthly, Grok 4’s $300/month price and recent missteps raise the stakes. Will it redefine AI or falter under scrutiny? Time will tell. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-10T11:15:00,"Ether, AI Coins Steal Bitcoin’s Spotlight: Crypto Daybook Americas","By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Everyone’s buzzing about bitcoin (BTC) finally catching a bid, setting record prices on several exchanges and igniting bullish excitement. But don't let the spotlight on BTC cast AI coins into the shadow. Major tokens supposedly associated with artificial intelligence, such as TAO, ICP, RENDER and FET, surged as much as 8% in the past 24 hours, outpacing even the 10 largest coins by market cap. The catalyst is chipmaker Nvidia, a bellwether for all things AI, which rallied to a market valuation of $4 trillion on Wednesday, the first time any company has achieved this milestone. ""The size and success of this giant, and the other US tech behemoths, underscores how much the AI trade can overwhelm the market's response to week-to-week fluctuations in economic data and policy headlines,"" Lisa Abramowicz, co-host of Bloomberg Surveillance, said on X . In other words, the AI sub-sector of the crypto market could get really hot. Let's turn to ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, which also outshone the No. 1 coin yesterday amid record trading volumes in BlackRock's spot ether ETF. The rally followed Fidelity’s latest report , which highlighted the Ethereum blockchain's lead over Solana and other programmable chains in terms of developer activity, total value locked (TVL) and stablecoin use. The report emphasized ether's dual role as both a medium of exchange and a store of value — narratives that have worked in bitcoin's favor for years. In other news, PUMP, the official token of Pump.fun, traded 40% above its upcoming ICO price, while FART, VIRTUAL, and PENGU have each logged double-digit gains. SHIB appeared poised to outperform BTC, but continued to trade on a weak footing against its rival, DOGE. Finally, macroeconomic factors necessitated that traders prepare for volatility. As QCP Capital astutely put it: “With a reignited trade war, a hawkish Federal Reserve, and tightening liquidity, volatility is likely to spike. Macro catalysts are lining up—so buckle up for a wild ride.” Stay alert.

The PUMP-USD perpetual contract went live on July 9 following community requests and offers up to 3x leverage. In its first 24 hours, the contract saw $30 million in trading volume, indicating strong interest despite the token not yet being live on-chain. Open interest on Hyperliquid stood at over $17 million during Asian morning hours on July 10. Activity is expected to rise further as Binance Futures introduces its own PUMP perpetual contract at 07:30 UTC today. The token sale will distribute 33% of the total 1 trillion supply, with 18% already allocated in a private round and 15% set for the public sale. Both tranches are priced at $0.004 and will be fully unlocked at launch. The project is marketing PUMP as more than a meme token — positioning it as the foundation for a decentralized Web3-native social platform that rivals TikTok, Twitch and Facebook by rewarding users with financial benefits instead of just engagement. Since its rise in early 2024, Pump.fun has played a central role in Solana’s memecoin boom, offering frictionless token launches and capturing over $600 million in protocol revenue, largely from trading and launch fees. Derivatives Positioning BTC and ETH funding rates on offshore perpetual exchanges are holding below annualized 10% despite price rallies, indicating little signs of overheating. Ether perpetual futures open interest climbed for a fourth straight day, hitting a tally of 5.46 million ETH. Funding rates for XRP, DOGE, ADA, HYPE and SUI topped the 10% mark, indicating a growing interest in long positions. On the CME, three-month basis in BTC futures bounced slightly to 8% from 5% early this month, but overall activity remains subdued. On Deribit, BTC and ETH call skews strengthened across tenors. However, front-end options show relatively stronger call skew. That's a sign of under-positioned traders panic buying with the price rise. OTC network Paradigm reported mixed block flows in BTC options, featuring risk reversals and put spreads. Traders bought ETH topside across tenors from July to December.

BTC vs gold market cap: 9.47% Technical Analysis The BTC breakout from the counter-trend channel, although encouraging, still warrants caution as prices remain below the May high of around $112K. A firm move above that level is needed to cement bullish expectations, opening doors for $115K, the long-term trendline hurdle. The positive MACD histogram supports the bull case. Still, traders need to be vigilant for a renewed weakness here as that would likely strengthen the double top narrative, leading to a self-fulfilling decline.

2025-07-10T11:09:35,"Little Pepe Crypto Price Forecast: Will LILPEPE Drop 2 Zeros from Its Price if Bitcoin (BTC) Hits $200,000 in 2025?","The post Little Pepe Crypto Price Forecast: Will LILPEPE Drop 2 Zeros from Its Price if Bitcoin (BTC) Hits $200,000 in 2025? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Picture this: by the end of 2025, Bitcoin will be worth $200,000. Experts, such as Bitwise, suggest that this could occur due to record-breaking inflows into spot ETFs and increased demand from institutional investors. In that case, a chain reaction could occur in the crypto world, sending smaller Layer-2 memecoins into orbit, such as Little Pepe (LILPEPE) . Could LILPEPE increase from $0.0013 to $0.13, a decrease of two zeros, if Bitcoin surpasses $200,000? Let’s unpack the narrative. A Meme Coin Built Smart LILPEPE isn’t floating on meme hype alone—it’s built on a robust Layer-2 Ethereum structure, offering zero fees, anti-bot protections, staking, and even its launchpad. It’s the kind of token analysts say “charges like the crypto Dogecoin of 2025—only smarter.” Its presale has been winning early investor confidence: Stage 3 sold out fast, and Stage 4, priced at $0.0013, has already raised $3.26 million and sold over 75% of its tokens, triggering a rise to $0.0014 at cap, with a guaranteed $0.003 listing—ensuring an instant 130% gain before trading starts. When Bitcoin Smacks Down $200K If Bitcoin hits that $200K milestone, it sets the stage for a classic altcoin surge. LILPEPE’s stage 4 presale completion results in a jump to $0.0014, followed by a $0.003 launch price that secures early profits. As altcoin fever spreads, token value could climb into the $0.01–$0.03 range, especially with Layer‑2 utility and whales validating the setup. With continued momentum, viewers could see values reaching $0.05–$0.10 and nearing the $0.13 mark—a 100-fold increase. Speculative optimism even puts the all-time high closer to $0.16, reinforcing the case for a significant price drop to two zeros. Whale Backing and Hype Engine The move isn’t just theoretical: on-chain data shows Ethereum whales quietly stacking LILPEPE tokens in bulk. One whale reportedly invested six figures, signaling absolute confidence. The $770,000 giveaway, which distributes $77,000 to ten community members, has garnered significant attention on Telegram and X. As investors with substantial funds, new businesses and viral giveaways converge, the conditions are ripe for explosive growth, particularly as Bitcoin becomes increasingly scarce. Can LILPEPE Reach $0.13? Achieving a leap from $0.0013 to $0.13 means delivering a bold 100× return, but everything is lining up. With presale mechanics creating built-in gains, guaranteed listing securing early upside, advanced Layer‑2 utility and BTC-fueled altcoin fervor—LILPEPE’s launchpad is ready. Timing is key: each step—from $0.0014 to $0.003 to mid-cent centiles—has momentum built in. And if Bitcoin hammers past $200K, investor psychology often skews toward the “high-gain hunt” flag, making $0.13 not a pipedream but the tail end of a perfectly structured rally. Risks Worth Noting Of course, this path isn’t guaranteed. The Stage 4 presale must be completed, the exchange listing must proceed smoothly, and Layer-2 capabilities must be deployed without issues. If Bitcoin’s journey stalls below $200K—or regulatory uncertainty arises—momentum could slow. However, even with moderate success, tokens with aligned fundamentals and price-leveraged inflows can still drive 10- to 50-fold supercycles. Final Word If Bitcoin realizes its $200,000 potential, altcoins built on utility and narrative—such as Little Pepe—could experience a significant upside. A near-term token price of $0.13 to $0.16, representing 100×–123× gains, is well within the realm of possibility under the right conditions. With whales in the ring, presale mechanics solid, and community FOMO humming, this isn’t a hopeful projection—it’s strategic positioning.

2025-07-10T11:09:13,"Missed the Bitcoin Pump? Kraken Helps You Ride the Next Altcoin Wave with Pro Trading Tools","If you blinked and missed Bitcoin’s latest rally, you’re not alone. After soaring to an ATH above $112K last night , $BTC has cooled off a little, leaving sidelined investors wondering if they missed their shot. But while the king of crypto takes a breather, a new trend is heating up: altcoins are making moves. And Kraken’s making sure you don’t miss round two. This exchange boasts over $1.6B in daily trading volume and supports the market’s growing interest in smaller caps with over 400 supported assets. The rotation is real, and it’s happening now. From pro-grade trading tools to a dedicated section for the newest listed tokens, Kraken is positioning itself as the go-to venue for discovering breakout altcoin plays in this upcoming rally. Altcoin Momentum Is Building Bitcoin is hovering around $111K this morning, but it’s the altcoin charts that are stealing the spotlight. On Kraken, five of the top gainers in the past 24 hours surged over 29%, with Memecore ($M) up 62.25% and Pudgy Penguin ($PENGU) up 34.38%. It’s not just meme coins, though. Layer 1s like Rujira ($RUJI) and Tanssi Network ($TANSSI) are gaining traction too. With hundreds of listed assets, Kraken gives traders a wide-open runway to ride the rotation of top altcoins , especially as capital trickles down from the majors into higher-risk, higher-reward plays. And to turn up the heat, Kraken’s Rear Wing Takeover is fueling even more action. This is an F1-themed trading contest, where the most-traded memecoin will earn a spot on the Williams Racing car at the Singapore Grand Prix. It’s put tokens like $PENGU, $TOSHI, and $LOFI into a full-speed showdown, with community glory (and global exposure) on the line. Kraken Pro Gives You the Edge Altcoin hunting isn’t just vibes anymore. It’s about data, execution, and speed. Kraken Pro gives you all three. This isn’t your average exchange UI. Kraken Pro is a customizable trading terminal that lets you build your ideal setup from 25+ widgets. You can view multiple charts, track order books in real time, and execute advanced order types like stop-loss, take-profit, and reduce-only. All in one place.

Whether you’re scalping the best meme coins or riding momentum plays, Kraken Pro turns speed and control into a serious trading edge. Discover New Gems with Kraken’s ‘New’ Tab Kraken is making it easier than ever to catch altcoin momentum early. In the last week alone, tokens like $TANSSI, $EPT, $ICNT, $MERL, and Memecore ($M) have featured here after listing, some rallying significantly soon after. The ‘New’ tab on Kraken Pro gives you a front-row seat to what’s just hit the market, with filters for memes, DeFi, gaming, and more via the ‘Categories’ tab. It’s one of the few U.S.-regulated platforms consistently listing new altcoins at this pace, giving traders a rare mix of access and trust. If it’s trending, it’s probably trading on Kraken. Don’t Miss the Next Move Bitcoin might’ve made headlines, but the real action now is in altcoins, and Kraken is giving you the tools to stay ahead of the curve.

2025-07-10T11:08:03,"Bitcoin's Q2 Boom Being Fueled by Corporates: Bitwise","Corporate adoption of bitcoin (BTC) accelerated dramatically in Q2, with public companies purchasing 159,107 BTC and bringing their collective holdings to 847,000 BTC valued at $91 billion, according to Bitwise . This represents a 23% increase in holdings quarter over quarter and covers 4% of bitcoin’s total capped supply of 21 million BTC. The average bitcoin price climbed to $107,754, which drove a significant 61% boost in portfolio value compared to Q1. The number of publicly listed firms holding bitcoin rose to 125, marking a 58% increase and welcoming 46 new companies into the fold. Strategy (MSTR) remains the leader, holding 597,325 BTC, followed by MARA Holdings (MARA) with 49,940 BTC and newcomer Twenty One (XXI) with 37,230 BTC. Key developments fueling this surge include GameStop’s (GME) inaugural bitcoin acquisition of 4,710 BTC, signaling its entry into the crypto space. Meanwhile, Trump Media filed plans to raise $2.5 billion for bitcoin accumulation, underscoring how even politically linked enterprises are eyeing digital assets. Tokyo-listed Metaplanet (3350),also made headlines by surpassing giants, such as Toyota and Sony in trading volume, highlighting the global breadth of corporate interest.

2025-07-10T11:00:59,"‘Real’ Crypto Bull Run Just Beginning, Says Analyst—Here’s Why","In a livestream broadcast on X, independent market technician Kevin, known online as @Kev_Capital_TA, argued that crypto markets are only now entering what he called “the real bull run,” pointing to a confluence of technical signals, macroeconomic data and inter-market correlations that he believes have not been fully appreciated by traders. The Real Bull Run Starts Here Kevin placed particular emphasis on the behavior of Tether dominance (USDT.D), the share of crypto market capitalization held in the dollar-pegged stablecoin. The analyst displayed two long-term logarithmic USDT.D charts, each showing an initial sharp decline followed by what he described as a “rising channel slash bear flag.” In both 2024 and the present structure, the measured-move target of the pattern sits at 3.70 percent. “It’s really astonishing how this is kind of attempting to play out,” he said, stressing that any sustainable rally in risk assets will require that level to be reached. “The two key words that are going to be the most important words over the next couple of weeks are follow through.” Related Reading: Crypto Market Cap On Track To $4.5 Trillion As Q3 Unfolds – Details He then overlaid a macro descending triangle on a separate two-week USDT.D chart dating back to March 2020. Each time the two-week Stochastic RSI crossed downward, the dominance metric fell sharply, coinciding with periods of strength in Bitcoin and altcoins. The latest cross, now curling lower, again targets 3.70 percent. If that support were to give way, Kevin allowed, a deeper slide toward “the two-percent handle” could mark a “peak bull market” phase—though he cautioned against speculating that far ahead. The technical discussion broadened to Bitcoin’s hash-ribbon indicator, which tracks miner capitulation and recovery. Historically, weekly “buy” signals have preceded 40 to 100 percent upside moves within nine weeks, with what Kevin called a “100 percent hit rate” over eight years of back-testing. Kevin linked the on-chain data to macro conditions. Citing the real-time inflation gauge “Truthflation,” he highlighted a 1.66 percent reading—below the Federal Reserve’s nominal 2 percent target—and falling import prices, both of which, he argued, increase the odds of an imminent shift to easier policy. “If Truthflation stays below 2 percent, you’re going to get the easing you want,” he said, predicting that markets would price in an end to quantitative tightening ahead of any official announcement. “Retail traders are becoming more educated than they’ve ever been.… The market will sniff out rate cuts coming.” Altcoin capital rotation formed a second pillar of the bullish thesis. Ethereum’s market-share chart, he said, had been basing at 2019-2020 lows, with monthly MACD, Stochastic RSI and Market Cipher signals all turning up. Early reallocations into ETH-beta names such as Chainlink and Uniswap are already “up 60 percent” from their accumulation zones, he claimed, framing the moves as the foothills of a broader run. Nonetheless, he warned viewers not to wait for central-bank confirmation: “Don’t be the person sitting on the sidelines waiting for Powell to come out saying QT is over.” Related Reading: XRP Set To Shock The Crypto Market With 30% Share, Analyst Predicts Turning to Bitcoin itself, Kevin acknowledged that the benchmark still faces substantial resistance. Price must clear the March record, then the $112,000–$116,000 range and, ultimately, $120,000 before “thin air” opens a path to $140,000–$150,000. Similarly, the “total three” index—market cap excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum—needs a daily close above $877 billion and, crucially, the yellow-shaded resistance band that has capped rallies five times since February. Only then, he argued, would a new all-time high for the broader alt-basket come into view. Despite the optimism, Kevin repeatedly returned to the notion that conviction without confirmation is premature. “We need to see real deal price action,” he said, noting that Bitcoin’s daily RSI has not reached the 90-plus “euphoria” zone since 2017. He called the post-March tape “down-trending crappy price action” and insisted that any declaration of a full-fledged cycle peak must await multiple days of decisive follow-through. In closing, the analyst underscored the time sensitivity of the opportunity. With the halving behind and the traditional four-year cycle ostensibly entering its final phase, “you’ve got five to six months of what should be elite-level price action,” he said. Whether or not the textbook cycle ends on schedule will depend, in his view, on the interaction between a Federal Reserve pivot and the crypto market’s ability to anticipate it. For now, Kevin’s roadmap is unambiguous: monitor USDT dominance for a breakdown toward 3.70 percent, watch for successive hash-ribbon buy signals, and demand momentum “follow through” above the identified technical hurdles. If those conditions are met, he contends, the rally that many traders thought was already under way will reveal itself as only the warm-up act for “the real bull run.” At press time, BTC traded at $111,250.

Settlement methods will explore CBDCs, stablecoins, bank deposit tokens, and innovative applications of existing commercial bank deposits held at the RBA. Testing will occur over the next six months using platforms such as Hedera, Redbelly, R3 Corda, and Canvas Connect, with a final report expected in the first half of 2026.</p><p>RBA Assistant Governor Brad Jones said the selected use cases will help assess how both central bank and private digital money, alongside payments infrastructure, could enhance Australia's wholesale financial markets. The RBA remains focused on wholesale applications, having found limited economic justification for a retail digital currency. Expected benefits include lower risks, improved transparency, better collateral efficiency, and cost reductions.</p>
