2025-07-10T14:54:45,"Best Crypto to Buy Now With New SEC Guidelines On Cryptocurrency ETPs","For years, the idea of government regulation in crypto sparked heated debates. Many saw it as a threat to the decentralized spirit that gave birth to Bitcoin and altcoins. But as the space matured, and as major institutions, banks, and even governments began stepping in, the conversation changed. Regulation, once viewed with suspicion, is increasingly seen as a necessary framework to help crypto scale responsibly. The SEC’s latest guidelines reflect this narrative too. Rather than stifling innovation, they aim to give crypto a defined place within the broader financial system, offering clarity on risks, custody, and disclosures. This moment could mark a turning point, one where crypto is no longer just an outsider asset, but a recognized player with vast potential ahead. SEC’s New Guidelines and What They Mean for Crypto The SEC’s recent release of detailed guidance for crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) marks one of the clearest regulatory moves in recent memory. After months of watching crypto ETFs flourish with little uniformity, the Commission has now outlined specific areas issuers must address. Chief among these are disclosures on price volatility, custodial practices, hacking risks, and market manipulation safeguards. Issuers are expected to break down exactly how they handle private key security and whether they use cold, warm, or hot storage solutions. 🚨NEW: The SEC’s Corp Fin division has issued fresh guidance on disclosure expectations for crypto ETPs. It gives a detailed outline of what issuers need to include in filings — from how they calculate NAV and select benchmarks to custody practices, service provider… pic.twitter.com/s5rvTbq2dE — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) July 1, 2025 Importantly, the SEC is also asking for transparency around incidental rights like forks, airdrops, or other network events that can impact coin supply and value. Another key point is clarifying how fees erode the underlying crypto per share over time. For investors, these guidelines create a more transparent landscape, helping advisors and clients alike better understand the products they engage with. For the crypto industry, it sets the stage for faster, clearer approvals and signals that regulators are taking digital assets seriously, not to restrain them, but to integrate them meaningfully into financial markets. In parallel, Bitcoin has once again broken past the $112,000 all-time high, a milestone that coincides with this regulatory progress. Whether coincidence or correlation, demand for crypto appears to be surging, making this an unusually compelling time to evaluate entry into Bitcoin and altcoins as both adoption and legitimacy accelerate. Best Crypto to Buy Now As Altcoin Demand Starts Increasing Best Wallet Token Best Wallet Token serves as the native token of Best Wallet, a multi-chain Web3 wallet built to simplify crypto management for users without reducing functionality. It handles cross-chain transactions, decentralized finance activities, NFT storage, and portfolio tracking within a single, unified system. The token plays several roles: it reduces transaction fees inside the wallet, grants access to advanced features, and gives holders a say in how the platform develops over time. Having raised more than $13 million already, one of the main features that the project offers is its transaction batching mechanism, which allows multiple actions to be combined into a single on-chain approval. This reduces both time and gas costs, creating a smoother user experience. In addition, token holders can participate in staking, receiving rewards while helping secure the wallet’s operations. 🔥 Over $13M Raised and Counting! 🔥Best Wallet is becoming the go-to for traders who want speed, simplicity, and early access to what matters:✅ Buy new tokens early, directly in-app✅ Buy and bridge across chains in one place✅ Full portfolio control, no clutterDownload… pic.twitter.com/0SDNVPov6v — Best Wallet (@BestWalletHQ) June 4, 2025 With the SEC’s recent guidelines offering more structure around crypto products, tools like Best Wallet are well placed to meet the needs of a growing user base seeking both simplicity and transparency. As crypto shifts from an experimental niche to part of mainstream finance, having a wallet that meets technical demands while aligning with clearer regulatory expectations becomes more valuable. Best Wallet Token, through its practical functions and governance layer, fits into this changing environment, offering users an integrated approach to managing digital assets with greater confidence. SUBBD SUBBD offers a decentralized platform designed for digital creators to engage with their audiences without the limitations often imposed by traditional platforms. Through SUBBD, creators can monetize their work directly using subscriptions, one-time tips, and collaborative projects, bypassing the commissions and algorithm-driven exposure models common elsewhere. The SUBBD token enables payments, governs platform decisions, and supports creator-led initiatives, creating a more balanced relationship between creators and their supporters. One of its most practical features is the automated subscription model powered by smart contracts. Fans can subscribe using micro-payments that renew automatically on-chain, ensuring creators receive support without middlemen. Creators can also issue access tokens for premium content or exclusive updates, providing tailored experiences for their communities. With the SEC’s recent push for better disclosure and clarity in crypto projects, platforms like SUBBD gain relevance. Clearer regulatory frameworks help define how tokenized creator economies can operate without legal uncertainty. For creators, this reduces risks tied to sudden platform changes or revenue disruptions. For audiences, it offers more transparency in how they support the voices they care about. As digital economies evolve alongside regulatory improvements, SUBBD reflects how crypto can reshape industries beyond finance and introduce fairer models for creative work. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper is a Layer 2 network developed to increase Bitcoin’s scalability and functionality by processing transactions off-chain while anchoring final settlement to Bitcoin’s main network. This approach allows for higher transaction throughput and the use of smart contracts without modifying Bitcoin’s core design, effectively expanding what can be built around it. A central feature is the use of rollup technology combined with zero-knowledge proofs, which compress large sets of transactions before they are finalized on-chain. This reduces network congestion and opens space for decentralized applications such as exchanges, lending markets, and NFT platforms that rely on faster, more efficient infrastructure. The timing of Bitcoin Hyper’s progress coincides with the SEC’s new guidelines, which offer clearer rules for custody, transparency, and market safeguards. While these guidelines apply broadly, they set a more predictable backdrop for projects that connect to major assets like Bitcoin. The project has already gained recognition, thanks to multiple media posts and YouTube videos, especially on high-reach channels like 99Bitcoins and more. Recently, Bitcoin crossed the $112,000 level again, a milestone reflecting renewed demand across the crypto market. Projects like Bitcoin Hyper benefit from this momentum by offering the infrastructure that supports further use cases and adoption, making the broader crypto space more accessible and capable. Token 6900 Token 6900 takes an unconventional approach in a space crowded with projects that often chase trends without offering substance. Built around community participation and self-aware design, Token 6900 operates as both a social experiment and a functional ecosystem. It creates an economy where holders shape the narrative and direction, not through vague promises but through clear, rule-based interactions coded directly into its smart contracts. One example is how the token uses event-triggered mechanisms. When certain milestones are hit; for example, a specified number of transfers or liquidity events, then the contract executes predefined actions, such as adjusting supply or redistributing a portion of the pool back to active holders. This creates a dynamic environment where engagement is not just cosmetic but has measurable impact on the token’s state. The SEC’s recent emphasis on transparency and disclosure indirectly benefits projects like Token 6900. While it thrives on unpredictability within its own ecosystem, the framework within which it operates becomes clearer when regulators define how risks, rewards, and mechanics must be communicated to the public. TOKEN6900 full of raisins. $250k mfers. pic.twitter.com/bczl1mencT — Token6900 (@Token_6900) July 9, 2025 This helps filter out projects relying on ambiguity or hype alone, giving space for those that have real structure behind their ideas. As interest in alternative tokens grows alongside broader crypto momentum, Token 6900 presents itself as a case study in how creative ecosystems can function with purpose in an increasingly mature digital market. Snorter Snorter is a Telegram-integrated bot that blends artificial intelligence with crypto utility, offering users a way to interact with blockchain features directly from their chat interface. Rather than requiring external platforms or complex steps, Snorter lets users execute functions like price tracking, wallet management, token swaps, and on-chain queries within Telegram itself. This makes crypto activity feel closer to everyday communication, lowering the barrier to entry for a wide range of users. A particularly useful feature is Snorter’s ability to automate trades based on predefined triggers. For instance, users can set instructions for the bot to execute swaps if certain market conditions are met, creating an experience that merges accessibility with real-time action. Additionally, Snorter supports community management tools for projects, enabling token distribution, announcements, and community analytics within a familiar environment. With the SEC’s new guidelines pushing for clearer communication around how crypto tools operate, bots like Snorter stand to benefit. Users will increasingly look for services that explain their functions, risks, and limitations in straightforward terms. Snorter’s mix of convenience and transparency aligns with this shift, offering a service that is both practical and accountable. As the market continues to draw in new participants, especially following Bitcoin’s surge past $112,000, tools that simplify crypto interactions without compromising clarity will likely see heightened demand. Conclusion The SEC’s recent move creates a market environment where serious projects can thrive, and where both investors and developers gain more confidence in the stability of the space. It is not about eliminating risk, but about understanding the framework in which risk operates. Combined with Bitcoin’s recent surge past previous highs and the visible increase in altcoin demand, the stage appears set for a new phase of activity. Projects, like the ones mentioned above, stand to gain heavily from such developments, making it one of the best times to start accumulating for high returns in the coming months.

2025-07-10T14:30:46,"Bitcoin is aiding Afghanistan's human rights push","Digital currencies are providing Women in Afghanistan with the tools to stand up against an oppressive regime. That’s according to the Digital Citizen Fund (DCF) founder Roya Mahboob, who was speaking in an interview on the sidelines of the Bitcoin Policy Summit . The tech entrepreneur and human rights advocate said Bitcoin and other crypto assets offered her sisters suffering under the Taliban’s restrictive rule a hope of bettering their lives. Ms Mahboob added that her organization provided Afghan women with financial and digital literacy through online and underground channels. A significant part of that training is on BTC ownership and use. She said Afghanistan’s restrictive setup made the premier cryptocurrency a survival tool, hence their teaching them how to transact in it. According to her, that restrictiveness also makes it easy for the women to understand it, explaining, “It’s much easier for them to get it because it gives them a hope of financial freedom.” Bitcoin is aiding Afghanistan’s human rights push Ms Mahboob also stated that her initiative transcends the coin’s transactional aspects. She has integrated human rights aspects into her BTC campaigns by collaborating with the Human Rights Foundation. To her, the crypto asset’s decentralized nature made it a vital cog in pushing for the democratization of financial services in her country. Afghanistan’s prohibitive setup has for long prevented women from accessing financial services for different reasons. These include a lack of IDs, denial of rights to paid employment, restrictions on accessing education, and financial matters. This situation worsened with hardline Islamists seizing power. Banks denied Afghans who’d worked for the previous regime, civil society, women’s rights organisations, and services. However, Ms Mahboob explained that BTC and other cryptos were giving them the means to skirt the social and financial ostracization many still face. Their people-centric nature gave her and other rights campaigners hope of freeing Afghanistan’s oppressed from their economic shackles. Afghanistan’s Bitcoin campaign has a long way to go Despite the steady gains that Ms. Mahboob’s BTC education campaign has made, it still faces significant challenges. The main obstacle is education as the entire Afghan womenfolk can’t access education, for four years since fundamentalists overran Kabul. That has meant using undercover schools at the peril of the learners and instructors. Moreover, the movement faces connectivity challenges, particularly in rural Afghanistan. The DCF depends on the internet to disseminate its educational material in a country with one of the lowest global internet coverage rates and strict censorship policies. Add to the complexity that comes with understanding crypto technology, and that makes reaching the target audience daunting. Afghanistan has enforced a strict cryptocurrency ban since 2022, motivated by religious and economic policies under Taliban rule. Yet, crypto transactions remain active in underground markets, powered by peer-to-peer (P2P) networks that evade government control. Rooted in Sharia law, the ban has pushed crypto use into secrecy, where it continues to play a vital role in remittances and personal savings. Officially, all forms of crypto transactions remain “haram” with authorities threatening severe reprisals for anyone undertaking them. What’s encouraging, though, is that an underground crypto market thrived. Whispers have even suggested Talibros are in it, perhaps indicating a change of tune. Other countries that have banned digital assets include Bangladesh, Nepal, Algeria, Morocco, and Bolivia. While crypto is welcomed in many parts of the world, these countries are wary of its volatility and decentralized nature. Some also perceive it as a threat to their current monetary systems while being concerned about its use to support illicit activities like drug trafficking, money laundering, and terrorism. Several nations have outright banned digital currency, while others have tried to cut off any banking and financial system support essential for its trading and use.

2025-07-10T14:30:35,"‘The Math Just Doesn’t Work’ – Analyst Hits JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs With Downgrade, Says Downside Risk Not Factored In","HSBC is detailing its major downgrade of JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America. On Tuesday, HSBC dropped its recommendation on JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) from hold to reduce. The firm also downgraded the recommendation on Bank of America from buy to hold. In an interview , HSBC’s head of US financials research, Saul Martinez, says the banks have solid fundamentals, but their valuations raise concerns. “We were not adopting a more negative view of operating fundamentals. We still think that net interest income is on the right track. You know, you are seeing some growth there. Obviously, there are some nuances to each of the downgrades, JPMorgan, Goldman to reduce and Bank of America to hold, but at a high level, it’s valuation. Pricing is not factoring in downside risk and the dilutive impact of buybacks at much higher multiples.” Martinez says he was not convinced that JPMorgan deserves its price. “In JPMorgan’s case, I think the math just doesn’t work at these valuations. The stock, so with banks, you look at price to tangible book value multiples and return on tangible common equity. Higher ROTC (return on tangible common equity), higher price to tangible. JPMorgan is trading close to three times tangible. That is a very elevated multiple.” He says it’s a similar case for Goldman Sachs. “We feel like we’re swimming against the tide with Goldman a little bit because the investment banking landscape is good. The risk-reward is very skewed here. We think good news is priced in, but again, if the market cools off and IB (investment banking) activity doesn’t really move forward, we don’t get a super cycle in IB activity, I think there’s more room for disappointment here than for upside.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-10T14:23:15,"Bitcoin Blasts to $112,017 ATH – What’s the Best Crypto to Buy Before the Next Surge?","After hovering below the $110K mark over the past few weeks, Bitcoin hit a new all-time high yesterday. Bolstered by growing institutional adoption, $BTC is stronger than ever. And that means now’s the time to buy crypto before the next surge. $BTC finally reached the $100K milestone late last year, before outdoing itself in May, when it reached $111,970. Making it to $112,017 is another first for the crypto OG. Make no mistake, Lady Luck played no hand in Bitcoin’s surge. It’s down to an ever-growing list of financial institutions worldwide that are recognizing the value of $BTC, due in part to supportive government policies. Top Guns Weigh In Bitcoin champion Michael Saylor, Executive Chairman of Strategy, argues that Bitcoin has gotten through its riskiest period. In fact, he told Bloomberg in a June 10 interview that he believes that $BTC will be $1M. “The President of the United States supports Bitcoin. The Cabinet supports Bitcoin. [Treasury Secretary] Scott Bessent supports Bitcoin. Paul Atkins has shown himself to be enthusiastic about bitcoin and digital assets. Brian Quintenz at CFTC feels that the banks will custody Bitcoin.” Saylor explained that Bitcoin Treasury companies are buying $BTC’s natural supply. In addition, “BlackRock and the ETFs are buying another measure of that, and we’ve got nation-state actors coming into the space. The writing is on the wall. Bitcoin is moving higher.” Bitcoin’s status as a heavyweight institutional asset is solidifying fast. And while Saylor’s Strategy continues to grab the spotlight, the corporate herd is growing. Take GameStop, for instance. It made waves in May by greenlighting Bitcoin buys at the board level. Soon after, GameStop purchased 4.71K Bitcoin . And for its part, the Trump Media and Technology Group is also eyeing a blended crypto ETF. Dubbed the “ Crypto Blue Chip ETF ,” it plans to offer exposure to five digital assets. Some 70% of the ETF’s holdings will be in $BTC, 15% in $ETH, 8% in $SOL, and 5% in $XRP. The remaining 2% of the ETF’s holdings will be in $CRO – the native token of the ETF’s digital custodian, the exchange Crypto.com . Bitcoin Wins, Crypto Scores With fresh ETF inflows, increased corporate balance sheet exposure, the rise of crypto futures , and a more favorable regulatory environment, $BTC is experiencing a powerful surge in institutional interest. And the momentum shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. So, if you’re wondering which crypto to buy before the next big surge, you’re in the right place. Here are three altcoins with massive potential to explode when $BTC rallies again. If Michael Saylor’s predictions hold true, that surge could be just around the corner. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Scalability for Bitcoin Through an L2 In keeping with all things $BTC, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) brings an exciting proposal to the crypto table. A Bitcoin Layer-2 (L2) platform. The Bitcoin blockchain has a lot going for it, especially in terms of top-level security. It falls short, however, in terms of speed and high transaction fees, especially when compared to the likes of Solana. In short, Bitcoin lacks scalability. That’s where $HYPER steps up to the plate. This upcoming meme coin is set to power an innovative Bitcoin L2 ecosystem that will increase the speed and reduce fees. More importantly, it adds cross-chain compatibility. That means seamless access to the best meme coins , DeFi, and dApps. At the moment, Bitcoin Hyper is on presale. That means you can buy it for $0.0122. You can also stake your $HYPER for 360% APY. If you’re keen to discover more about this L2 and the meme coin behind it, take a look at our guide to buying $HYPER . It explains all you need to know. Keep in mind, though, that as a presale, the price of $HYPER will increase in stages, offering you the chance to secure tokens at a lower cost now. Additionally, the rewards APY is dynamic and will decrease over time, so the earlier you get in, the better the returns. Once $HYPER lists on DEXs after the presale, the price is expected to rise even further, so now is a prime opportunity to get involved before the price climbs. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Driving Global Crypto Wallet Market Domination It’s not only institutions that are taking Bitcoin and other digital assets much more seriously these days. With the growing number of retail, as in individual, investors also entering the scene, it means a bigger demand for crypto wallets. That’s what makes the Best Wallet Token ($BEST) one to watch with a very close eye. It’s the native token of Best Wallet, a non-custodial, no KYC, multi-chain, and multi-currency hot wallet that is gaining serious market traction. So much so that Best Wallet is on a mission to dominate 40% of the global crypto wallet market by the end of next year. And it’s using $BEST to help it achieve that target. Holding $BEST means additional benefits and features of what is already a leading crypto wallet. That includes being able to buy the best presale crypto directly from the mobile wallet (a market first, by the way); lower transaction fees; and higher staking rewards. $BEST also comes with community governance. So you can have a say in the project’s direction – including the presale tokens available to buy, and other features. $BEST is also on presale. Buy yours today for $0.025305 and stake it for 99% before the upcoming price increase. Our How To Buy $BEST guide explains how to do just that. 3. America Party ($AP) – On the Heels Of Musk’s New Party The America Party Token ($AP ) is another newcomer to the crypto scene. It was launched mere days after Elon Musk announced he intends to create a new political party. However, unlike $HYPER and $BEST, which are both on presale, $AP is already listed on DEXs. To be clear, though, the $AP token is not affiliated with Musk or the America Party he is launching. That said, $AP does stand to ride on Musk’s coattails. And to sweeten the deal, when Musk mentions a cryptocurrency, meme coins in particular, that token often explodes. And recently, Musk was asked by a follower whether his America Party will embrace Bitcoin. His response was definitive: “Fiat is useless, so yes.” Another boost for crypto. Right now, $AP costs $0.01830 – up 239.38% since it launched on July 7. Get yours today through UniSwap or MEXC. “The Writing’s On The Wall” As Saylor put it, “Bitcoin is moving higher.” And while the market can be unpredictable at best, $BTC’s latest rally to $112K is a definitive indicator that the institutional adoption of digital assets is positively impacting, and with signs of slowing. That means newer cryptos like $HYPER , $BEST , and $AP also have the potential to pump if current conditions continue. And the best part of investing in new tokens is getting in at an early-bird price. That said, nothing is guaranteed, and we’re not financial advisers. Be sure to always DYOR research before making any investment.",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-blasts-to-ath/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL","Cryptocurrency Market News",cryptocompare

James Wynn, a high-profile crypto trader and risk-taker, has opened a massive short-term Bitcoin trade with 40x leverage.

2025-07-10T14:21:32,"Open Interest in XRP Options Nears $100M as High Volatility Draws Yield Hunters","The dollar value locked in open XRP options contracts listed on Deribit is rapidly climbing to a record as the token's high implied volatility draws yield hunters. The so-called notional open interest (OI) has risen to nearly $98 million from $71 million since the June 27 quarterly expiry, a solid 38% rise in two weeks. It is now nearing the June 24 record of $102.3 million, according to data source Deribit Metrics . In contract terms, the OI has increased by 26% to 42,414. (The contract multiplier for XRP on Deribit is 1,000 XRP). Behind the increase is the token's implied volatility, a measure of expected price swings over a specific period. XRP's is higher than bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and solana (SOL), according to Lin Chen, Deribit's head of Asia business development. ""XRP has delivered an annual return of over 300% over the past 12 months,"" Chen told CoinDesk. ""Its options have also gained significant popularity, reflected in the highest implied volatility among major tokens — indicating strong investor demand."" One way traders are making gains is by selling cash-secured puts, Chen said. Writing a put option — agreeing to buy the asset at a set price — is akin to selling insurance against price drops in return for a premium, which represents the seller's return. Traders typically write options against holdings in the spot market or in a ""cash-secured"" way when the implied volatility is high. The higher the volatility, the costlier the options and vice versa. The cash-secured version involves holding enough stablecoins to ensure the underlying asset can be bought if the price slides and the put buyer decides to exercise their right to sell the asset at the predetermined price. Risk reversals are skewed bullish As of the time of writing, the 25-delta risk reversals were positive, indicating a bias toward call options, or bullish bets, according to data tracked by Amberdata. The 25-delta risk reversal is a strategy that comprises a long put position and a short call option (or vice versa) with a 25% delta, meaning both options are relatively far from the underlying asset's current market price. The pricing for risk reversals across tenors helps identify market sentiment, with positive values representing a relative richness of calls and negative values indicating a downside bias. At press time, short-term XRP risk reversals and those tied to August and September expiries were positive. Furthermore, more than 30 million calls were open, outstripping 11.92 million puts, giving a put-call ratio of 0.39, also a sign of bullish sentiment in the market.

According to an official announcement posted on Truth Social, users who subscribe to the $9.99 per month Patriot Package will access ultra-fast streaming of selected “non-woke” news channels, a red verification checkmark, improved comment visibility, and access to a Truth+ badge. Patriot package subscribers to earn tokens through rewards program Per Truth Social’s post, the loyalty package subscribers will be eligible to participate in a beta test that allows them to accumulate digital “gems” through platform engagement. The gems will eventually be tied to a utility token usable across Truth Social and its affiliated Truth+ media service. Truth social token announcement. Source: Truth Social Though still in beta, the company asserted that under the Patriot Package, the more active a user is on the platform, the more future tokens they will accrue. Oddly, despite its $9.99 monthly cost, the Patriot Package has fewer news channels than the platform’s free tier. The premium service includes 12 curated channels, while the no-cost plan includes 27, among them international broadcasters such as Euronews and a Spanish-language outlet. Truth social files for crypto ETF A fortnight before this token teaser, Truth Social had also filed an S-1 registration with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a new crypto exchange-traded fund, dubbed the “Truth Social Crypto Blue Chip ETF.” The filing proposes that the ETF’s assets will list Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Cronos (CRO). The preliminary allocation breakdown lists 70% in Bitcoin, 15% in Ethereum, 8% in Solana, 5% in Cronos, and 2% in Ripple. According to the prospectus, Yorkville America Digital is listed as the fund’s sponsor, while Foris DAX Trust Company will become the custodian of the digital assets. The ETF, if approved, is set to be offered on the New York Stock Exchange Arca. This application follows two prior filings by Truth Social, one for a standalone Bitcoin ETF in June and another combining both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Trump media’s previous crypto plans Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), Truth Social’s parent company, has been involved in several blockchain-based initiatives since Donald Trump returned to the Oval Office in January. In April, TMTG disclosed to shareholders that it was considering a utility token as part of a digital wallet solution. The wallet would allow users to pay for Truth+ subscriptions and other services within the Truth ecosystem. In May, the company denied the “unauthorized and misleading” rumors that it planned to launch a Truth Social-themed meme coin. Earlier in the year, Trump Media signed a binding agreement with exchange giant Crypto.com and asset management firm Yorkville America Digital to roll out several crypto-based ETFs under a “Made in America” branding umbrella. Trump’s financial ties to crypto continue Donald Trump and his family have formed a number of financial relationships in the crypto world, including one with Dubai-based Aqua 1 Foundation in June. Aqua 1 pledged a $100 million investment in World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a Web 3 firm tied to both Trump and real estate developer Steve Witkoff, the Middle East diplomatic envoy of the Trump administration. Under the agreement, Aqua 1 acquired $100 million worth of WLFI tokens. According to publicly disclosed terms, Trump personally receives 75% of all WLFI token sales, which could net him $75 million in revenue. The foundation was virtually unknown prior to the transaction, but now ranks among the largest contributors to Trump’s crypto-linked enterprises. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-07-10T14:00:09,"Bitcoin Is One Candle Away From $141,300 Breakout, Chart Master Warns","Top analyst Aksel Kibar (CMT) believes Bitcoin is approaching a decisive moment on the weekly chart. In a post shared on 9 July 2025, the veteran technician noted that BTC/USD is “holding right at the pattern boundary.” The annotated chart he released—covering Bitstamp weekly prices back to mid-2022—shows the cryptocurrency compressing directly beneath a horizontal resistance band at $109,000, the neckline of what he labels a six-month head-and-shoulders (H&S) continuation formation. Bitcoin Poised For $141,300 Kibar’s chart first revisits the basing sequence that reversed the 2022 bear cycle. A textbook inverse head-and-shoulders bottom completed in early-2023, with troughs at roughly $17,600 (left shoulder), $15,500 (head) and $19,500 (right shoulder). The breakout above the neckline sent Bitcoin to $31,400. Related Reading: Bitcoin & Stablecoin Reserves Diverge On Binance: Liquidity Explosion Brewing? Immediately thereafter, price stalled in a six-month rectangle bounded by $25,000 support and $31,400 resistance. The eventual topside resolution propelled the market to the rectangle’s implied target of $38,000, validating two consecutive classical projections in less than a year. Afterwards, the BTC price grinded higher. Below $73,700, BTC consolidated in a falling wedge, ending with a breakout toward $109,000. From that point, the initial pullback bottomed at $91,200, creating what Kibar designates as the left shoulder. A deeper descent to $76,500 carved out the head. Then, the Bitcoin price formed the right shoulder at $101,500, echoed by the blue bowl-shaped arc on the chart. Throughout this structure the neckline at $109,000 remained intact, acting as a clear demarcation between consolidation and fresh highs. The inverse head-and-shoulders pattern spans roughly half a year, matching the analyst’s “6-month-long” annotation. Related Reading: Last Time This Happened, Bitcoin Jumped $50,000—Is History Repeating? Using the orthodox H&S continuation rule—adding the vertical distance from the head ($73,700) to the neckline ($109,000) to the breakout level—Kibar derives a price objective of $141,300. He notes in an X reply that this target is separate from the earlier $137,000 objective, which came from a larger cup-with-handle on the monthly scale. In other words, the shorter-term weekly pattern now projects modestly higher than the longer-term structure. At press time Bitcoin, Bitcoin traded near $111,000, surpassing the neckline. However, from a technician’s standpoint, the breakout still needs to confirm with the weekly close. Confirmation requires a decisive weekly settlement north of the $109,000 neckline. As Kibar notes: “Breakout needs to take place with a long white candle, similar to previous pattern completions. There should be no hesitation.” Invalidation would emerge on a weekly close back below the most recent swing-low support at $101,500; deeper failure beneath $91,2000 would unravel the pattern entirely. For now, Bitcoin sits at the fulcrum of its six-month equilibrium. A weekly candle or two should reveal whether the largest digital asset can convert yet another classical chart formation into a measured move—this time toward mid-six-figure territory.

2025-07-10T14:00:08,"BlockDAG Hits $335M Presale as It Delivers Real Ecosystem While Bitcoin Pepe’s CEX Listing Shows What’s Next","Bitcoin Pepe is catching fresh attention as its centralized exchange (CEX) listing just wrapped up. Its presale crossed big milestones, fueling chatter in meme coin circles. The Bitcoin Pepe price keeps climbing as meme-powered energy builds in the community. It has all the signs of typical meme momentum: fast moves, social chatter, and a rush of short-term traders hoping for huge spikes. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) keeps stacking up real progress. Its ongoing presale has now raised over $335 million and isn’t just talking about plans; it’s putting out working tools, from its X1 mobile miner to low-code dev kits. In a crypto space crowded with empty promises, BlockDAG shows what actual delivery looks like. One project is pushing headlines. The other is setting new standards in blockchain. Bitcoin Pepe Faces Next Steps After CEX Listing The big Bitcoin Pepe CEX update went live on June 30, and the project is still working hard to stay visible. Its presale sparked plenty of interest, with the Bitcoin Pepe price moving up sharply and a meme-rich community plus staking perks pulling in fast-moving traders. Many are hoping to grab short-term profits from this fresh meme wave. The roadmap hints at token burns, listings, and community rewards to support growth later. But right now, the Bitcoin Pepe presale leans more on meme buzz than working features. There’s no live ecosystem yet, no real tools people can use. So this update could prove whether the excitement holds up after launch. The Bitcoin Pepe CEX update might be its chance to show it can back up the hype with real traction. BlockDAG Proves Tools, Miners, and Developer Community Work While Bitcoin Pepe talks up future updates, BlockDAG is already delivering at scale. It uses Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) tech to process thousands of transactions at once without slowing down like old blockchain chains do. This means it’s designed for efficiency and to handle growth smoothly. BlockDAG’s massive $335 million presale has powered actual releases. Its X1 Miner app is already in use by more than 2 million people, letting anyone mine up to 20 BDAG daily with no fancy gear. The working testnet supports smart contracts, DeFi tools, and bridges, all made easy with its low-code, no-code builder kits. Security is tight too. CertiK and Halborn have both reviewed its system, and its modular smart contracts mean quick upgrades when needed. The BlockDAG Academy and dev grants also pull in more builders daily. On the coin performance side, it’s still gaining ground. Early batches offered BDAG at a fraction of the price; those early users now see a 2,660% ROI from batch 1 to batch 29. The coin is set to launch at $0.05, but right now, it’s open for just $0.0016 until August 11. That means anyone who grabs it now could see a 3,025% gain at launch if all goes as planned. So while Bitcoin Pepe rides hype, BlockDAG shows how real blockchain delivery works. Bitcoin Pepe vs BlockDAG Short-Term Play or Real Ecosystem The Bitcoin Pepe price chart and recent CEX listing keep people excited. That June 30 moment was a big test. But just riding big moves doesn’t always mean long-term results. BlockDAG stands as a real example of how blockchain should look when it’s actually live. From a working miner app to testnet tools, real audits, and a growing community of builders, it’s not just hype, it’s real traction. Where Bitcoin Pepe gives meme vibes, BlockDAG builds systems. Short-term traders may run to Bitcoin Pepe, but those wanting something that can scale and deliver are picking BlockDAG instead. The Bottom Line Bitcoin Pepe has caught a lot of eyes with its presale hype and its recent June 30 CEX launch. The price action and meme factor have pulled in people who love the thrill of quick moves. Now that the listing is live, it might spike, but what happens when the early excitement fades? This is where BlockDAG clearly leads. Its presale has already crossed $335 million, the X1 mobile miner is live, and its smart contracts and dev tools are working today, not tomorrow. While Bitcoin Pepe stays in the spotlight for its hype, BlockDAG keeps delivering substance and an ecosystem built for the long haul. Anyone watching for real progress, daily use, and growth that goes beyond memes is keeping an eye on BlockDAG. It’s not just another promise, it’s a blockchain built to last.

2025-07-10T14:00:00,"Skyline announces wrapped cAP3X token launch on Cardano","Blockchain developer Skyline has announced plans to deploy cAP3X, a wrapped AP3X token, on the Cardano blockchain , according to the information shared with Finbold on July 10. The launch, developed in collaboration with the Apex Fusion Foundation, will create a Cardano-native asset that provides access to the Apex Fusion ecosystem. The wrapped utility token will operate natively on Cardano ( ADA ), enabling interoperability between the Cardano and Apex Fusion networks. Users will be able to engage in cross-chain value transfers between the two blockchain ecosystems. Token integration and trading The cAP3X token will be compatible with Cardano wallets and DeFi protocols, with plans to establish an ADA/cAP3X trading pair and provide initial liquidity for Cardano-based decentralized exchanges. After deployment in July, users can transfer cAP3X from Cardano to PRIME Chain, Apex Fusion’s UTXO Layer 1 blockchain, using the Skyline Bridge. Once bridged to PRIME, cAP3X converts to native AP3X at a 1:1 ratio for use across Apex Fusion protocols. Staking rewards The native AP3X tokens on PRIME Chain can be staked in Apex staking pools, offering up to 10% APY rewards through liquid staking mechanisms currently active on the network. PRIME Chain combines Bitcoin’s UTXO security model with Ethereum’s ( ETH ) smart contract functionality, utilizing the Ouroboros consensus mechanism for staking operations. The network aims to address blockchain fragmentation by integrating existing networks. Following the token deployment and liquidity setup, bridge activation and staking features will become available on PRIME Chain. Technical documentation and integration guides will be released prior to the wrapped token launch to support developers and users. Featured image via Shutterstock.

2025-07-10T13:51:16,"$21M Flows Into First US Solana ETF as Snorter Token Approaches $1.7M Milestone","On July 8, the first US-listed spot Solana ETF – Rex-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF (SSK) – recorded $21M in net inflows. Impressively, this pushed its total inflows to a hefty $41.2M in the first four days of launching. That single-day surge surpassed the $2.02M raised in the previous three trading sessions, effectively more than doubling the total inflows into the ETF. This is fantastic news for Solana. SSK’s ability to attract more users and capital significantly boosts the network’s visibility, liquidity, and overall credibility, positioning it for even greater success moving forward. As such, it’s highly bullish for Solana-based projects, like Snorter Token ($SNORT) . Already, it has nearly raised $1.7M owing to being the backbone of a novel Telegram trading bot slated to launch in Q3 2025. Solana ETFs Still Lag Behind Bitcoin & Ethereum Still, SSK’s footprint remains relatively small compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Despite doubling on July 8, the $41.2M in inflows represents just 0.5% of Solana’s market cap, far below Bitcoin’s 0.34% and Ethereum’s 0.3% penetration rates during their ETF launches. This gap primarily stems from SSK’s structure. Around 40% of its assets are tied to offshore Solana ETFs, whereas the rest is directly invested in $SOL. Also not working in its favor is that it carries the highest fee amount of other US crypto ETFs at 0.75%. Additionally, it launched with a $600K seed basket (the initial pool of assets), far less than the $300M+ seeded by ETF giants like Fidelity and BlackRock. The SSK ETF’s impressive doubling highlights the growing early institutional interest in Solana. Should the SEC approve pending Solana ETF applications from Franklin Templeton, VanEck, and Grayscale, it could trigger a fresh wave of capital into the network. As demand for the blockchain continues to rise, Solana-based projects like $SNORT are poised to benefit from the increased activity. Now could be the perfect time to explore these low-cap opportunities before they gain significant traction. Snorter Bot Telegram Trading Bot Eyes Solana Debut $SNORT is the backbone of Snorter Bot, a crypto trading bot currently under development. Built directly on Telegram, it promises to make trading the best meme coins faster, safer, and easier. The bot will enable you to manage every part of your trading strategy from the fourth-largest messaging app worldwide : spot new tokens, snipe launches, place trades, and set stop losses. All will be achieved without compromising security. Snorter Bot will include real-time honeypot detection, rug pull alerts, and MEV protection . By doing so, it’ll shield you from malicious tokens and front-running attacks so that you don’t get caught off guard. Given that $2.2B in crypto was stolen last year , protective trading platforms like Snorter Bot have never been more necessary. It’ll initially go live on Solana to take advantage of the network’s low fees and high-speed transactions. After that, it’ll expand to EVM-compatible chains like Ethereum, BNB Chain, Avalanche, and Arbitrum. With fees as low as 0.85% for $SNORT holders, it’ll undercut top trading bots like Trojan and Maestro, which typically charge 1%. Beyond granting reduced fees, $SNORT also unlocks governance rights (anticipated around Q4 2025), additional premium features, and high-yield staking rewards, currently offering a 218% APY, which is not to be overlooked. In fact, there’s no better time to lock up some $SNORT. As more investors join the project, this percentage is likely to decrease, resulting in higher returns while also enhancing the ecosystem’s sustainability. It’s no wonder $SNORT has quickly raised $1.6M+ on presale in just a few months and shows no signs of slowing down. Buy $SNORT for Possible 861% Returns Solana’s recent ETF inflows are a clear sign of growing institutional interest, signaling a strong upward trend for the network. With the potential approval of more ETF applications by the SEC, even greater capital could flow into the blockchain. This bodes well for Solana-based projects like Snorter Token ($SNORT), which stand to benefit from the increased activity and investment. You can buy $SNORT on presale for as low as $0.0977 to get the most out of the Snorter ecosystem. Once listed on the best crypto exchanges , as promised around the end of the year, it’s projected to hit $0.94 . Thereby, there’s no better time to join for potential 861% gains. This is not financial advice. Always do your own research (DYOR) and make informed decisions based on your own risk tolerance.

2025-07-10T13:45:22,"Animoca Brands, DDC Enterprise take first steps toward $100M BTC treasury plan","Animoca Brands is expanding its role as a Web3 and gaming fund, recently joining DDC Enterprise in a bid to expand its BTC treasury. The VC fund and gaming startup will contribute up to $100M for its treasury strategy. Anomica Brands struck a partnership with DDC Enterprise, with the goal of injecting $100M for BTC treasury expansion. With this move, Animoca Brands shifts its attention from Web3 startups and games, aiming to allocate a part of its assets back to BTC. So far, Animoca Brands has raised $825.9M, which have been used for its own games, as well as for startups. The company started its fundraising efforts in 2015, and continued through several bull markets, building up a significant ETH and BTC treasury. The exact BTC holdings are not specified, but the company has an extensive crypto portfolio, accrued over the years. “ Our partnership with DDC enables Animoca Brands to enhance the value of our blockchain technologies and maximize the value of our Bitcoin holdings,” added Yat Siu, co-founder and executive chairman of Animoca Brands. Animoca Brands joined the BTC treasury trend after slowing down its VC investments into riskier early-stage projects. Animoca Brands to advice on BTC yield strategies DDC Enterprise Limited (DDC) signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding with Animoca Brands. The fund will help DDC to develop and implement yield strategy for the current BTC treasury. Animoca Brands will extend help and allocate up to $100M in BTC toward yield enhancement strategies operated by DDC. The move will accelerate the DDC accumulation strategy, in addition to its recent $528M financing package. The fundraising is split between PIPE raises, a $300M convertible note, $200M equity line, and a $2M equity private placement. Yat Siu, the co-founder and executive chairman of Animoca Brands, will join DDC’s Bitcoin Visionary Council, providing guidance on the company’s Bitcoin treasury operations. DDC has a relatively small treasury of 138 BTC, starting out in May this year. The company’s BTC treasury is part of the latest wave of companies pivoting into BTC and planning larger purchases with the help of credit facilities. Animoca Brands is also involved with DigitalX, an Australian treasury company. The fund invested just $20.7M into DigitalX, as a precursor to its largest deal to date. DDC trades near a six-month high DDC is one of the treasury companies that benefitted from its BTC purchases in the short term. The stock is trading near its highest level for the year to date period, recovering to $11. However, DDC is still far from its peak from November 2023, when the stock traded above $155. Unlike other treasury companies, DDC will continue expanding its food business, retaining BTC as its core reserve asset. DDC has promised an aggressive accumulation strategy, while still retaining a portfolio of food brands. Despite the sliding stock price, the DDC portfolio of brands is on the verge of being cash-positive, making for a viable combination of real-world business and a BTC treasury. Previously, DDC has stated it intends to build a treasury of 5,000 BTC, turning into a medium-sized corporate holder. The company is one of the first to mix financing deals for acquiring BTC, while tapping a partner that may have coins on hand for an OTC deal.

After closing 0.6% higher on Wednesday, the S&P 500 opened near the flatline and is hugging its record high zone. The S&P 500, the benchmark index, was up 0.06%, benefiting from the upbeat sentiment around Nvidia (NVDA), a company that has rode the overall bullish outlook for stocks to storm to the $4 trillion valuation.

The AI chipmaker’s stock closed 1.8% higher on July 9, 2025, trading at $162 and helping the Nasdaq Composite hit a new record high . Comparatively, the S&P 500 has advanced 6.7% year-to-date and 96% in the past five years.

Trump has also threatened an additional 10% tariff on BRICS countries. Also attracting market attention will be U.S. weekly jobless claims and the Federal Reserve’s next move regarding interest rates. Positive news around these factors may help dilute any potential headwinds from the global trade war. While analysts have noted a potential sell signal for the S&P 500 as it looks to rally above 6,300, some experts are forecasting a continuation. “This is a broad-based global bull market and we don’t think it’s slowing down anytime soon,” Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group, told CNBC. The bullish sentiment also engulfs the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin ( BTC ) rising to a new all-time high above $112k. Altcoins are also largely up. Meanwhile, oil is down 1.5% around $67 and gold is poised near $3,335.

2025-07-10T13:31:39,"Bitcoin could reach between $250,000 and $350,000","Bitcoin’s price is seen as a market bellwether. Analyst Matthew (@OneBasedMoney) suggests it follows a power law model , doubling roughly every 12.7% of its lifespan—indicating exponential, not linear, growth. Currently, Bitcoin is in a quiet phase, often a precursor to major bullish runs. Macro Outlook & Scarcity Matthew compares Bitcoin to fiat money supply (~$26T), which is expected to rise due to future monetary easing. As fiat is devalued, scarce assets like Bitcoin (21M cap) become more attractive, reinforcing its role as a hedge against inflation. Price Target: $250K–$350K by End of 2025 Based on his model, Bitcoin could reach $250,000–$350,000 by late 2025 / early 2026 , aligning with previous cycle peaks. Matthew believes Bitcoin’s value is now driven 95% by internal adoption trends—not macro events—highlighting a maturing market led by users, tech, and institutions. Final Surge Likely While long-term growth may slow, a euphoric end-of-cycle rally remains probable, fueled by rising spot ETF interest and institutional flows. However, questions linger about Bitcoin’s role as fiat expands and markets evolve. Conclusion: Bullish Outlook Despite uncertainties, Bitcoin’s fundamentals—fixed supply, growing adoption, and institutional interest—support a strong bullish case.

2025-07-10T13:20:11,"Bitcoin’s Explosive Surge: Unlocking the $133K Potential by September","Are you ready for a potential seismic shift in the crypto landscape? The world of digital assets is abuzz with a bold Bitcoin price prediction that could see the leading cryptocurrency reach an astonishing $133,000 by September. This isn’t just wishful thinking; it’s a meticulously crafted forecast from a respected crypto market research firm, 10x Research, that has caught the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike. If you’ve been tracking Bitcoin’s journey, this latest analysis offers a compelling reason to pay closer attention. What’s Fueling This Bold Bitcoin Price Prediction? The latest bullish sentiment surrounding Bitcoin stems directly from insights provided by Markus Thielen, a prominent analyst at 10x Research. According to Cointelegraph, Thielen’s firm has identified a significant shift in their internal trend model. On June 29, this model officially turned bullish, signaling a strong probability of continued upside momentum for Bitcoin over the next two months. This isn’t just a hunch; it’s a data-driven assessment that assigns a substantial 60% probability to this upward trajectory. Thielen emphasizes that historical trends often provide a reliable compass for future price movements. Based on current levels near $111,000, a 20% gain, as suggested by historical patterns, would indeed propel BTC to the $133,000 mark. While the third quarter (Q3) of the year has historically been a weaker period for Bitcoin, Thielen believes that the current cycle possesses unique characteristics that could defy this established trend. This defiance could be attributed to a confluence of factors, including renewed institutional interest and evolving macroeconomic conditions that favor digital assets. Decoding the BTC Market Analysis: Beyond the Numbers To truly appreciate the significance of 10x Research’s forecast, it’s essential to delve deeper into the broader BTC market analysis . The prediction isn’t isolated; it’s part of a complex interplay of on-chain data, derivatives market activity, and macroeconomic indicators. One of the key drivers cited is the robust demand for call options. But what does this mean, and why is it so important? Understanding Bitcoin Call Options: What they are: Call options give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy an asset (in this case, Bitcoin) at a specified price (the strike price) on or before a certain date. Why strong demand is bullish: High demand for call options, especially those with higher strike prices, indicates that a significant number of market participants anticipate a substantial price increase. They are willing to pay a premium for the potential to profit from future upside. Market sentiment indicator: This demand acts as a strong indicator of bullish sentiment among sophisticated traders and institutional players who use derivatives for hedging or speculative purposes. Furthermore, the market’s current structure, particularly in the derivatives space, suggests a leaning towards bullish outcomes. Traders are positioning themselves for upward movement, which can create a self-fulfilling prophecy to some extent, as positive sentiment attracts more capital. Navigating Current Crypto Market Trends and Their Impact The bullish outlook for Bitcoin isn’t happening in a vacuum. It’s intrinsically linked to the broader crypto market trends that have been shaping the digital asset landscape. Several factors are converging to create a fertile ground for potential price appreciation: Key Drivers Influencing Bitcoin’s Trajectory: Factor Description Impact on Bitcoin Institutional Adoption Continued inflow into spot Bitcoin ETFs, indicating growing acceptance from traditional finance. Increases demand, provides regulatory clarity, and adds legitimacy to Bitcoin as an asset class. Halving Event Aftermath The supply shock from the recent Bitcoin halving is gradually manifesting in reduced selling pressure from miners. Creates a scarcity effect, historically leading to significant price rallies in the months following the event. Macroeconomic Environment Potential shifts in interest rate policies, inflation concerns, and global economic stability. Bitcoin can act as a hedge against inflation or a safe haven asset during economic uncertainty, attracting capital. Technological Advancements Ongoing development within the Bitcoin ecosystem (e.g., Lightning Network, Ordinals) enhancing utility and adoption. Improves scalability, reduces transaction costs, and broadens Bitcoin’s use cases, making it more attractive. The narrative around Bitcoin is evolving from a speculative asset to a legitimate component of diversified investment portfolios. This shift is crucial for sustained growth and attracting larger pools of capital, which can certainly contribute to the kind of upward movement predicted by 10x Research. The Strategic Importance of Bitcoin Call Options for Market Momentum The emphasis on strong demand for Bitcoin call options by Markus Thielen is not just a passing comment; it’s a critical piece of the puzzle for understanding the current market dynamics. Call options are powerful tools in the derivatives market, and their heightened activity signals a sophisticated positioning by large investors. When institutions and whales purchase significant volumes of call options, especially out-of-the-money (OTM) calls (options with strike prices higher than the current market price), it indicates a strong belief that the underlying asset’s price will rise substantially before the option expires. This creates a positive feedback loop: Increased open interest: More call options being held suggests a collective bullish bet. Dealer hedging: Option sellers (dealers) often hedge their positions by buying the underlying asset (Bitcoin) as the price approaches the strike price. This hedging activity itself can contribute to upward price pressure. Market sentiment amplification: The visible demand for calls can inspire confidence among other market participants, leading to further buying. This confluence of factors, driven by the strategic use of derivatives, adds a layer of robustness to the prediction. It’s not merely based on technical chart patterns but also on the positioning of significant capital within the market. Insights from 10x Research Outlook: What Does It Mean for Your Portfolio? The 10x Research outlook presents an exciting prospect for Bitcoin investors, but it’s crucial to approach such predictions with a balanced perspective. While the $133,000 target by September is compelling, it’s essential to consider both the potential benefits and inherent challenges. Benefits of a Bullish Outlook: Significant Capital Appreciation: For current holders, a move to $133,000 represents substantial gains, validating long-term conviction in Bitcoin. Increased Market Confidence: A strong rally can attract new investors and re-engage dormant ones, further strengthening the overall crypto market. Positive Ecosystem Impact: A rising Bitcoin price often pulls altcoins higher, benefiting the broader digital asset ecosystem. Potential Challenges and Risks: Market Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its dramatic price swings. While the prediction is bullish, sharp corrections can occur. Analyst Predictions Are Not Guarantees: While 10x Research is reputable, market forecasts are inherently speculative and subject to unforeseen events. Macroeconomic Headwinds: Unexpected global economic downturns, regulatory crackdowns, or geopolitical conflicts could derail even the most optimistic forecasts. Profit-Taking: As Bitcoin approaches significant price targets, some investors may opt to take profits, leading to temporary pullbacks. Actionable Insights for Investors: Given this optimistic yet cautious outlook, what should investors consider? Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always verify information and understand the underlying factors driving any prediction. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders or using dollar-cost averaging to mitigate risk. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: While a September target is short-term, Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition remains a key consideration for many investors. Diversification: While Bitcoin may be a strong performer, a diversified portfolio across various assets can help manage risk. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news, regulatory developments, and on-chain metrics that can influence Bitcoin’s price. The current market sentiment, bolstered by the analysis from 10x Research, paints a promising picture for Bitcoin’s near future. The confluence of a bullish trend model, strong demand for call options, and supportive macroeconomic factors suggests that Bitcoin could indeed be poised for a significant upward movement. A September Surge on the Horizon? The prospect of Bitcoin hitting $133,000 by September, as projected by 10x Research, injects a fresh wave of excitement and optimism into the crypto market. Markus Thielen’s analysis, grounded in a bullish trend model and robust demand for Bitcoin call options, offers a compelling narrative for the coming months. While Q3 has historically been a quieter period for Bitcoin, this cycle appears to be charting a different course, potentially defying past trends due to strong underlying fundamentals and evolving market dynamics. As always, the crypto market remains dynamic and unpredictable, but the signals from 10x Research provide a powerful indicator that Bitcoin’s journey towards new highs may just be getting started. For those tracking the digital gold, the next few months promise to be exceptionally interesting.

2025-07-10T13:19:10,"Bitcoin price analysis after hitting new all-time high: further gains or return to range lows?","Bitcoin has surged into major resistance at $111,250 after a bullish expansion. Without volume confirmation, price risks rejection and another rotation back toward range lows near $98,270. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is once again confronting a critical decision point as price trades into a long-standing high time frame resistance zone around $111,250. This level marks the current range high and has historically served as a ceiling for price action. Following a sharp bullish reaction from the value area high, BTC has made a strong push upward, but without sustained volume, the risk of rejection remains. Whether this area is broken with conviction or rejected again will likely dictate Bitcoin’s directional trend in the coming weeks and months. Key technical points Resistance at $111,250: High time frame range top and key structural level. Bullish Reaction from Value Area High: Recent breakout was aggressive but lacks sustained volume. Still Range-Bound: Between $111,250 resistance and $98,270 support. BTCUSD (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has posted a bullish expansion, lifting off from the value area high and surging into high time frame resistance. The level at $111,250 is not a random price zone, it marks a critical structural resistance that has capped prior attempts at higher prices. Structurally, Bitcoin remains within a wide trading range, with historical rejections from both the range high and range low resulting in full oscillations between the two extremes. You might also like: Australia begins second phase of tokenized asset and CBDC settlement trials with major banks Despite the strength of the recent move, price has not yet confirmed a true breakout. A decisive breakout would require strong candle closures above resistance and, most importantly, sustained volume influx. So far, this has not occurred, leaving the door open to a liquidity grab scenario, where stop orders from short sellers are triggered just before price stalls and reverses. If Bitcoin fails to push through $111,250 with volume-backed momentum, the likelihood of a range continuation increases. This would open the probability for a rotation back toward the lower boundary of the range, near $98,270, where resting liquidity remains uncollected. Such moves are typical in high time frame consolidations, where price oscillates between known liquidity zones until a true breakout or breakdown occurs. Until a clear breakout confirms the change in structure, Bitcoin remains technically range-bound, and caution is warranted. Price is at resistance, and without bullish follow-through, the probability favors another leg down within the existing range. What to expect in the coming price action If Bitcoin fails to break above $111,250 with conviction and volume, expect a rotation lower toward $98,270. A breakout with strong volume, however, could trigger a new all-time high attempt.

2025-07-10T13:16:06,"BTCS: The Rise Of The Ethereum Treasury Company?","Summary BTCS Inc. is a U.S.-based, publicly traded digital asset company that has recently gained significant attention after years of low market cap. Shares of BTCS have surged 140% year-to-date and over 600% in the last three years, driven by the company's plan to be an ETH Treasury business. The company, originally known as Bitcoin Shop, has evolved from an online Bitcoin marketplace to a broader blockchain technology player. While the hype isn't totally without merit, the $225 million ATM should give serious investors plenty of pause. Crypto company investors could be forgiven for having never heard of BTCS Inc. ( BTCS ) before. Despite being both U.S.-based and one of the oldest digital asset-related companies in the public markets, the stock has generally traded well below a $100 million market cap until recently: Data by YCharts Shares of BTCS are currently up 140% year to date and over 600% over the last 3 years. Typically when there are spikes in price/valuation to this magnitude, there is a primary catalyst and BTCS is no different. In this article, we'll look at what is driving the recent hype in BTCS shares as well as assess whether the stock is a 'buy' on news. BTCS Through The Years BTCS, an abbreviation for Blockchain Technology Consensus Solutions, used to be known as ""Bitcoin Shop."" Back when the company launched in 2014, it was primarily operating an online marketplace that accepted Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) for consumer goods similar to a company like Amazon ( AMZN ). After going public via reverse merger shortly after inception, BTCS quickly pivoted to Bitcoin mining which proved to be a challenging business for the company. Data by YCharts After essentially four straight years without revenue of any kind, the stock was up-listed to the Nasdaq back in 2021 in conjunction with yet another business pivot to Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) staking solutions, blockchain analytics tools, and digital asset treasury growth. This, admittedly brief, recap brings us to today where we have a stock ripping higher and now valued at about 20 times trailing sales. Ethereum Treasury Company As is quickly becoming normalized by companies like Bit Digital ( BTBT ) and Upexi ( UPXI ), digital asset treasury businesses utilizing tokens down cap of Bitcoin have become potentially viable ways for public companies to raise capital. This is what BTCS is now also attempting through an announced $225 million ETH purchase target on July 9th . While ETH has badly lagged Bitcoin in price for nearly three full years, it is still the native token of one of the most important blockchain ecosystems in the Digital Asset sector and claims the largest stablecoin TVL with $126 billion and roughly 50% share of market. Stablecoin Share By Chain (DeFi Llama) Given the apparent priority stablecoin regulation is now getting in the United States, validating transactions in the Ethereum ecosystem is dramatically cheaper than that of Bitcoin. Furthermore, unlike Bitcoin Treasury companies which don't typically mine the asset as well, ETH Treasury companies can natively stake their assets to generate positive returns for shareholders with minimal capex. BTCS, Investor Deck Even if the price of ETH stays exactly where it is, a positive operating return is to be expected assuming the company doesn't spend frivolously through SG&A or R&D. Data by YCharts At the end of March, BTCS had $21 million in total assets and a tangible book value of just under $18 million. The company reported just $270k in cash and about $20 million in crypto assets - most of which were staked. So the key question then; how does a company with just $21 million in total assets raise this capital to buy nearly a quarter of a billion in ETH? Answer: an ATM, among other things. On July 8th, BTCS CEO Charles Allen posted details on X of what was originally just a $100 million capital raise: This multi-pronged flywheel utilizes ATM sales, convertible debt, on-chain AAVE ( AAVE-USD ) borrowing, staking rewards, and Builder+—our proprietary block-building platform—to grow $ETH per share, drive revenue, and protect shareholder value by minimizing dilution. So far, we only have specific details of the ATM. The ATM Through a prospectus filed on July 8th, BTCS filed a $225 million common stock ATM: In accordance with the terms of the Offering Agreement, we may offer and sell shares of our Common Stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $225,000,000 from time to time through the Agent. Our Common Stock is traded on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “BTCS.” On July 7, 2025, the last reported sale price of our Common Stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market was $2.80 per share. For a company worth about $18 million, this is a serious amount of dilution. At the end of March, there were 20,206,880 shares outstanding. So far, it appears that BTCS has sold 600,000 additional shares to raise just under $3 million about $5 per share. Notably, the prospectus lays out more than just ETH purchases for use of ATM proceeds: We intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of the securities by us to provide additional funds for purchasing digital assets, working capital, and other general corporate purposes. As of the date of this prospectus supplement, we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses of the proceeds from this offering . Accordingly, we will retain broad discretion over the use of such proceeds Bold above is my emphasis. I don't doubt that the majority of capital raised from this ATM will be utilized to buy ETH, but the fact that a specific percentage isn't laid out should give any investor chasing this rally pause from where I sit. Closing Summary If it wasn't implied strongly enough above, I would be very cautious chasing this stock. BTCS has been a penny stock throughout its existence. And while I'll over the company some slack due to it being a cryptocurrency company throughout its entire existence, I think the pivot to ETH is more of a desperation play than anything else. Short squeezes with these kinds of stocks are always possible, so I'm not going to call it an outright 'sell.' But there is no way I'd put on 'buy' on this company at this point in time.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800341-btcs-rise-of-the-ethereum-treasury-company?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BUSINESS|ETH|REGULATION|BTC|MARKET","BTCS",cryptocompare

2025-07-10T13:11:59,"BIT Mining to Raise Up to $300M to Build SOL Treasury in Strategic Pivot","BIT Mining has announced plans to raise between $200 million and $300 million to build a Solana (SOL) treasury as part of a broader expansion into the fast-growing blockchain ecosystem. Key Takeaways: BIT Mining plans to raise $300 million to build a SOL treasury and shift away from Bitcoin. The company will convert all existing crypto holdings into SOL and begin operating validator nodes. Its pivot aligns with a growing trend of firms betting on Solana. The move marks a departure from its previous focus on Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Ethereum Classic mining, the company said in a Thursday press release . The company will convert all existing crypto assets into SOL and adopt a long-term holding strategy, citing Solana’s performance, infrastructure, and developer community as key drivers behind the pivot. BIT Mining to Riase Funds in Phases To support its new direction, BIT Mining plans to raise funds in phases, based on market conditions and capital availability. It will also begin running validator nodes on Solana, aiming to contribute to network decentralization and security while earning staking rewards. “We’re excited to take this bold step into what we believe is one of the most dynamic and promising ecosystems in the blockchain space,” said CEO Xianfeng Yang. “With our strong execution capabilities and long-term vision, we are confident in our ability to accelerate sustainable growth and deliver lasting value to our shareholders.” BIT Mining, currently the 17th largest public Bitcoin miner by market cap, operates across mining, hosting, and hardware production.

The pivot aligns BIT Mining with a rising group of firms reshaping their treasury strategies around digital assets. Last week, DeFi Development Corp. revealed that it has acquired $2.7 million worth of Solana as part of its aggressive crypto treasury strategy. Likewise, Canadian digital asset firm Sol Strategies, already trading on the Canadian Securities Exchange, holds over 420,000 SOL tokens, positioning itself as a significant institutional player in Solana’s ecosystem. Last month, the firm also filed to list its common shares on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker “STKE” as it ramps up its U.S. expansion. In its SEC filing, Sol Strategies emphasized its focus on Solana, citing the blockchain’s growing role in asset tokenization and digital infrastructure as key drivers for future growth. More Public Companies Diversify into Crypto Following the model pioneered by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, more public companies are diversifying into crypto holdings that include BTC, ETH, SOL, and XRP. Two other mining firms with “Bit” in their name have also reoriented around Ethereum in recent weeks. Bit Digital recently exited Bitcoin mining and acquired over 100,000 ETH after raising $173 million. Meanwhile, BitMine plans to raise $250 million to scale its ETH treasury, with Fundstrat’s Tom Lee joining as board chair. The announcement came after BIT Mining’s $10 million settlement in November with the U.S. Department of Justice and SEC over bribery allegations tied to its former business as 500.com, a Chinese lottery operator.

Video-sharing platform Rumble has partnered with crypto payment giant MoonPay to power its forthcoming Rumble Wallet, as originally reported by CoinDesk on July 10. The wallet, set to debut in the third quarter this year, will integrate MoonPay’s infrastructure to enable crypto-fiat conversions, allowing users to buy, sell, and swap cryptocurrencies directly within the Rumble platform. According to Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski, the wallet aims to empower content creators by giving them greater control over how they’re paid. “Rumble Wallet will change the game for creators, and MoonPay is the perfect partner to bring that vision to life,” Pavlovski said. As part of the deal, MoonPay’s Web3-focused creative agency Otherlife will migrate its operations to Rumble Cloud, using the platform’s decentralized storage and compute infrastructure to create native Web3 content. You might also like: Rumble wants to create its own digital wallet with Tether’s support The Rumble Wallet was initially announced in March, when Pavlovski revealed that Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin USDT, would support the initiative. At the time, he described the wallet as “the vehicle to help monetize creators better than most advertisers, especially in international markets.” The announcement followed Tether’s $775 million investment in Rumble in December last year, with $250 million earmarked to support the platform’s growth initiatives, including its push into crypto infrastructure. The Rumble Wallet marks a key step in the platform’s broader push into crypto. Originally launched in 2013 to support independent vloggers and small-scale content creators, Rumble has increasingly embraced digital assets as part of its business model. In late 2024, the company announced plans to build a crypto treasury with up to $20 million in Bitcoin ( BTC ), and it has since added BTC to its reserve — most notably purchasing 188 BTC for roughly $17.1 million in March this year.

BlackRock recently bought another 1,136 Bitcoin (BTC), valued at approximately $126.3 million. The purchase marks the latest in a quiet but aggressive accumulation streak that has quickly made the firm one of the largest Bitcoin holders globally. With a portfolio of over 702,000 BTC, the asset manager and ETF issuer has overtaken long-time giants like MicroStrategy and Binance, all within months of beginning its acquisition. At this pace, the firm is now within striking distance of the largest wallet in history, the 1.1 million stash belonging to Bitcoin’s anonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. ⚡ JUST IN: BlackRock has purchased 1,136 Bitcoin worth $126.25 million — bringing its total holdings to a staggering 702,000 $BTC . Do you see where this is going? 🧠 pic.twitter.com/keZdrz2Ish — CryptosRus (@CryptosR_Us) July 10, 2025 Much of BlackRock’s accumulation is tied to inflows into its spot Bitcoin ETF , the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT).

2025-07-10T13:10:42,"Urgent: Bitcoin Depot Data Breach Exposes 27K Users’ Sensitive Info","The world of cryptocurrency, while promising innovation and financial freedom, is not without its perils. A recent revelation from Bitcoin Depot , a major player in the Bitcoin ATM space, serves as a stark reminder of these risks. The company has publicly disclosed a significant data breach that has left nearly 27,000 users vulnerable, raising critical questions about crypto security and the safeguarding of precious user data . What Exactly Happened with Bitcoin Depot’s Data Breach? On June 23, 2024, an unfortunate incident unfolded within Bitcoin Depot’s systems. An external compromise led to unauthorized access to sensitive information belonging to a substantial portion of its user base. Specifically, approximately 27,000 individuals found their personal details exposed. The compromised user data included: Names Phone numbers Driver’s license numbers This type of information is highly valuable to malicious actors, as it can be used for various forms of identity theft and targeted scams. While Bitcoin Depot has stated that no evidence of data misuse has been found so far, the potential for future harm remains a serious concern for those affected. Why Was There a Delay in Notifying Affected Users? One aspect of this data breach that has drawn particular attention is the significant delay in notification. The incident occurred in June 2024, but the public disclosure came much later. According to a company spokesperson, this delay was not due to negligence on their part but was a direct request from federal law enforcement. An ongoing investigation required the information to be withheld to avoid compromising the probe, which reportedly concluded in mid-June 2025. This timeline, though lengthy, highlights the complex interplay between corporate responsibility, user transparency, and the demands of criminal investigations. While such delays can be frustrating for users who are left unaware of potential risks, they are sometimes deemed necessary by authorities to catch perpetrators or prevent further damage. However, it also underscores the challenges in maintaining digital privacy when external factors dictate disclosure timelines. How Does This Incident Impact User Data and Digital Privacy? The exposure of personal identifiers like names, phone numbers, and especially driver’s license numbers, carries significant risks. For the 27,000 affected Bitcoin Depot users, this could mean: Identity Theft: Malicious actors can use driver’s license numbers and other personal data to open fraudulent accounts, apply for loans, or even commit crimes in your name. Phishing and Social Engineering: Knowing your name and phone number allows scammers to craft highly convincing phishing emails or text messages, pretending to be legitimate entities to trick you into revealing more sensitive information or clicking malicious links. Targeted Scams: The information can be used to tailor scams specifically to you, making them more believable and harder to detect. For instance, they might know you use Bitcoin ATMs, making a crypto-related scam more plausible. This incident serves as a critical reminder that even in the decentralized world of cryptocurrency, centralized entities like ATM operators hold a significant amount of your personal information, making their crypto security protocols paramount to your digital privacy . What Can Users Do to Protect Themselves After a Data Breach? If you are among the 27,000 users affected by the Bitcoin Depot data breach , or even if you’re not, taking proactive steps is crucial for safeguarding your digital privacy : Monitor Your Accounts: Regularly check your bank statements, credit card statements, and credit reports for any suspicious activity. You can get a free credit report annually from each of the three major credit bureaus. Change Passwords: While passwords weren’t explicitly mentioned as compromised, it’s always good practice to update passwords for any accounts linked to your Bitcoin Depot profile or email, especially if you reuse passwords. Use strong, unique passwords for each service. Be Wary of Phishing Attempts: Be extremely cautious of unsolicited emails, texts, or calls. Cybercriminals often capitalize on data breaches by sending out fake alerts or offers to trick victims. Always verify the sender and never click on suspicious links. Consider a Credit Freeze: This is one of the most effective ways to prevent identity theft. A credit freeze restricts access to your credit report, making it difficult for fraudsters to open new accounts in your name. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): For all your online accounts, especially financial ones and crypto exchanges, enable 2FA. This adds an extra layer of security, making it much harder for unauthorized users to gain access even if they have your password. Report Suspicious Activity: If you notice any unauthorized activity, report it immediately to your bank, relevant companies, and law enforcement. These measures are not just for those impacted by this specific data breach but are essential practices for anyone navigating the digital landscape, especially within the cryptocurrency ecosystem where crypto security threats are ever-present. Enhancing Crypto Security: Lessons for the Industry This incident is a stark reminder for all cryptocurrency service providers, including ATM operators, exchanges, and wallets, about the critical importance of robust crypto security infrastructure. While Bitcoin Depot attributed the breach to an “external system compromise,” it highlights the need for continuous vigilance and investment in cybersecurity measures. Key areas for improvement and focus include: Regular Security Audits: Independent third-party audits can identify vulnerabilities before they are exploited. Employee Training: Human error is often a weak link. Comprehensive training on cybersecurity best practices is crucial. Advanced Threat Detection: Implementing sophisticated systems to detect and respond to unusual network activity or unauthorized access attempts. Data Minimization: Collecting and retaining only the absolutely necessary user data . The less data stored, the less there is to lose in a breach. Encryption: Ensuring all sensitive user data , both in transit and at rest, is strongly encrypted. Incident Response Plans: Having a clear, tested plan for how to respond to a breach, including communication strategies and recovery protocols. Maintaining high standards of crypto security is not just a technical challenge but a matter of building and maintaining user trust. In an industry built on decentralization and trustless systems, the centralized points of failure, like data repositories, become critical targets. Protecting digital privacy must be at the core of every operation. The Broader Implications for Trust in the Crypto Ecosystem Every data breach , regardless of the company, chips away at public trust in the digital economy. For the cryptocurrency sector, which is still striving for mainstream adoption and regulatory clarity, such incidents can be particularly damaging. They reinforce perceptions of the crypto space as risky or insecure, potentially deterring new users and institutional investors. The future growth of Bitcoin ATMs and other crypto services heavily relies on the confidence users place in their security measures. When user data is compromised, it directly impacts this trust. Companies like Bitcoin Depot bear a significant responsibility to not only provide convenient services but also to be impenetrable fortresses for the sensitive information they collect. The industry as a whole must learn from these incidents, continuously adapt, and prioritize digital privacy and robust crypto security to ensure a safe and sustainable future. Conclusion: Navigating the Digital Wild West with Vigilance The Bitcoin Depot data breach serves as a potent reminder that even as the cryptocurrency world evolves, the fundamental challenges of cybersecurity and digital privacy remain. For 27,000 users, this incident is a direct threat to their personal security, necessitating immediate action and ongoing vigilance. For the broader crypto industry, it’s a call to action to redouble efforts in fortifying defenses and earning the unwavering trust of users. As we continue to navigate the exciting yet sometimes perilous landscape of digital finance, staying informed, proactive, and demanding the highest standards of crypto security from all service providers is not just advisable—it’s essential for protecting your valuable user data and ensuring your peace of mind.

2025-07-10T13:09:39,"Here’s why Bitcoin and crypto prices are in a bull run today","Bitcoin and crypto prices resumed their bull run this week, helped by numerous tailwinds. Bitcoin ( BTC ) surged to a record high of $112,000, while the crypto market cap jumped to over $3.5 trillion. The rally occurred amid ongoing risk-on sentiment in the financial markets, as investors disregarded trade-related risks. One example was the rising Fear and Greed Index, which moved into the extreme greed zone of 75. Another notable development was the surging NVIDIA stock price , which reached a record high, with its market capitalization surpassing $4 trillion for the first time. Crypto prices often exhibit a close correlation with technology stocks, as both are characterized as high-risk assets. BTC and altcoins also advanced as demand from Wall Street investors continued rising. For example, spot Bitcoin ETFs crossed the important $50 billion inflow milestone for the first time after adding $218 million in assets on Wednesday. You might also like: Top 3 altcoins to buy in July if Bitcoin price breaks out BlackRock’s IBIT ETF now holds over $77 billion in assets and is bridging the gap with gold’s GLD ETF. Spot Ethereum ETFs also continued to see inflows, adding over $211 million on Wednesday. This brought total inflows to over $4.72 billion, much higher than at the start of the year. In a note, an analyst told Bloomberg : “Voracious demand from equity market vehicles such as ETFs and digital-asset Treasuries has underpinned a continuous bid for Bitcoin.” Crypto prices also advanced after the Federal Reserve released the minutes from its last meeting. These minutes showed that some Fed officials expect Trump’s tariffs to have a limited impact on inflation. As such, analysts are penciling in a 0.25% rate cut at the September meeting. Trump has called for a 300 basis point cut. Bitcoin price technicals contributed to the crypto rally BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news As we have written here and here , Bitcoin price has formed several bullish patterns that have contributed to the rally. It formed a cup-and-handle pattern and a bullish flag on the daily chart. It has now moved above the upper side of the cup and the flag, pointing to an eventual breakout. By measuring the size of the flag and the depth of the cup, one can estimate that Bitcoin price will eventually advance above $140,000 in the next few months. Such a move would then trigger further gains among altcoins like Ethereum and Cardano.

On 9 July, the US ETH spot exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) saw inflows surge to $211.32 million . This is a significant increase from $46.63 million a day before. But most notably, this is the second-highest amount in over five months. It’s also the third-highest amount in 2025 so far. More precisely, the highest increase in this period is $240.29 from 11 June this year. The previous peak is $307.77 million, seen on 4 February. This means that between 5 February and today, this is the ETFs’ second-highest inflow, as well as the third-highest since the beginning of the year. Overall, the all-time high still stands at $428.44 million. The amount was recorded on 5 December 2024. Following the launch of nine US spot bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, the ETH spot ETFs began trading in July that year. The chart below shows flows since the launch (red and green), as well as the total net assets (white).

One of the positive factors is the regulatory support for the industry in the US, as the country works towards forming a crypto market structure regulation. “Make no mistake: blockchain technology and digital assets are not going away – they are here to stay,” said US Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott during the first full committee hearing on digital assets on 9 July. Moreover, the US Federal Reserve decided to keep the federal funds rate steady , per the June minutes released on 9 July, as “tariffs pose a persistent risk for driving up prices.” However, many believe that a rate cut will happen this year if inflationary pressures ease. And interest rate cuts are typically favorable for crypto assets. Meanwhile, Ethereum is currently trading at $2,776. It’s up 5.5% in a day and 7% in a week. It’s unchanged in a month and down 10.5% in a year. It started the day with the intraday high of $2,869 and then plunged to $2,182, before gradually climbing back to the current level.

2025-07-10T13:02:44,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Trump Family Quietly Expands Crypto Holdings – Big Announcement Soon?","Bitcoin is up early Thursday, pushing towards $111,713 on a wave of bullishness. A 1.82% 24-hour gain and $62 billion in volume indicate deepening confidence in digital assets, particularly as high-profile figures like the Trump family double down on crypto investments. Now, just below $111,000, Bitcoin’s recent momentum is drawing attention from both institutional and retail players. Bitcoin just ripped +2.7% out of a textbook triangle breakout. Measured move target hit to the dollar at $112K. RSI at 78. Bulls are in full control. Next resistance at $112.8K and $113.4K. Breakout traders are winning this round. #BTC #Bitcoin #Crypto pic.twitter.com/m9xJChlU4f — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) July 9, 2025 One of the significant catalysts? A new $4 million investment in Thumzup Media by Donald Trump Jr. demonstrates that the Trump camp remains interested in expanding its crypto exposure. Meanwhile, corporate Bitcoin holdings are at all-time highs, indicating a shift in long-term strategy among public companies. Trump Family’s Growing Crypto Footprint Donald Trump Jr’s investment in Thumzup Media, a corporate Bitcoin holder, is a big deal for the family’s growing crypto portfolio . Thumzup, which started accumulating BTC in January 2025, is now diversifying into altcoins, including Ethereum, Solana, Dogecoin, and XRP. JUST IN: Donald Trump Jr. bought 350,000 shares of Thumzup Media, which holds $2 million in $BTC and plans to add 6 more cryptocurrencies as part of the family’s crypto treasury strategy. pic.twitter.com/E4wIx5tSha — crypto.news (@cryptodotnews) July 10, 2025 This is in addition to earlier Trump-backed initiatives, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, as well as a multi-coin index product launched through Trump Media. While Thumzup’s balanced asset approach may not have an immediate impact on Bitcoin prices, the bigger picture is clear: the Trump family is committed to crypto in the long term. Trump Jr invests $4M in Thumzup Media Thumzup adds ETH, LTC, DOGE, XRP, USDC Crypto is a central part of the Trump business strategy These moves reinforce the narrative that digital assets are becoming part of both political and corporate America. Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Hit New Highs While individual headlines get the attention, the real structural change is coming from the boardroom. Corporate Bitcoin holdings surged 23% in Q2 2025, with 159,107 BTC added, valued at $17.6 billion. That brings total institutional holdings to 847,000 BTC or 4% of Bitcoin’s supply. The number of public companies holding BTC also increased significantly. 46 new firms were added to the list, bringing the total to 125, a 58% quarterly gain. Notable names include: Strategy (Michael Saylor): 597,325 BTC MARA Holdings, Twenty One, Metaplanet GameStop and Trump Media are looking to raise $2.5B for BTC buys Institutional interest is no longer passive—it’s strategic, aggressive, and long-term accumulation. Bitcoin Bullish Breakout Above $111K From a technical standpoint, Bitcoin’s breakout from the symmetrical triangle is confirmed. The price has broken above the descending resistance and reclaimed the 50-SMA on the 2-hour chart at $109,200, accompanied by increased volume. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Now Bitcoin is consolidating just below $112,012 resistance, printing small-bodied candles—a classic bullish continuation. The RSI is at 64.3, indicating room to run before overbought levels are reached. No divergence is present. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Trade Setup Entry: Break and close above $112,012 Targets: $112,897 and $113,772 Stop-loss: Below $110,638 If the price retests $110,638 and forms a hammer or a bullish engulfing candle, that could be a lower-risk re-entry point. Conclusion: The Trump family’s renewed interest and record institutional accumulation are giving Bitcoin a strong narrative and technical tailwind. With price structure intact and RSI in favor of bull,s a push to $113,772 looks likely if $112K is broken with volume. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Over $2M as Price Rise Nears Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), has raised over $2 million in its public presale, with $2,261,067 out of a $2,637,961 target. The token is priced at $0.0122, with the next price tier expected to be announced soon. Designed to merge Bitcoin’s security with Solana’s speed, Bitcoin Hyper enables fast, low-cost smart contracts, dApps, and meme coin creation, all with seamless BTC bridging. The project is audited by Consult and engineered for scalability, trust, and simplicity. The golden cross of meme appeal and real utility has made Bitcoin Hyper a Layer 2 contender to watch in 2025. With staking, a streamlined presale, and a full rollout expected by Q1, $HYPER is gaining serious traction.

2025-07-10T13:01:36,"Bitcoin Maintains Momentum After Breaking Highs—New ATH Incoming?","The post Bitcoin Maintains Momentum After Breaking Highs—New ATH Incoming? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin price , which has been demonstrating strength over the past few days, laid a strong bullish case for the token. The crypto is continuing its strong uptrend after validating the breakout from a bullish pattern that has formed around $110,000. The price structure remains bullish, supported by previous retests and multiple continuation flags throughout the rally. Currently, the BTC price is now pressing just beneath the upper channel resistance, targeting a potential extension toward the $117,000 to $120,000. The positive price action of Bitcoin is reflected across the broader crypto market, with altcoins also experiencing gains. The crypto fear & greed index hovers in the neutral zone but is close to entering, ‘Greed’ zone, indicating strong bullish sentiment. Besides, institutional demand, particularly from spot Bitcoin ETFs, remains a key driver. Additionally, the recent U.S.macroeconomic data, including a cooling inflation rate and anticipation of potential interest rate cuts, has created a favorable backdrop for risk assets, including Bitcoin. Now the question arises, how high can the BTC price go in 2025? The latest price action of Bitcoin appears to be extremely bullish, suggesting that the bulls have maintained a strong grip on the rally. Connecting the highs, the next crucial resistance to surpass is $112,917.33, which may trigger a strong rally in the coming days. The supertrend has turned bullish with the latest breakout, hinting towards the beginning of a strong bullish trend. On the other hand, RSI is forming consecutive higher highs and lows and eventually pushes the levels towards the upper threshold. Therefore, the Bitcoin (BTC) price appears to be strongly within a bullish trajectory and hence is expected to maintain a strong ascending trend. However, the price is believed to consolidate for a while but eventually remains within a bullish influence.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-maintains-momentum-after-breaking-highs-new-ath-incoming/,"TRADING|BTC|MARKET|ALTCOIN","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-07-10T00:05:02,"RBA advances wholesale CBDC trials with industry partners","<p>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) announced on Thursday a significant step forward in developing a wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC), launching “Project Acacia” in collaboration with industry partners. The initiative will test 19 pilot programs using real money and assets for the first time, alongside five proof-of-concept trials involving simulated transactions.</p><p>The trials span various asset classes, including fixed income, private markets, trade receivables, and carbon credits. Settlement methods will explore CBDCs, stablecoins, bank deposit tokens, and innovative applications of existing commercial bank deposits held at the RBA. Testing will occur over the next six months using platforms such as Hedera, Redbelly, R3 Corda, and Canvas Connect, with a final report expected in the first half of 2026.</p><p>RBA Assistant Governor Brad Jones said the selected use cases will help assess how both central bank and private digital money, alongside payments infrastructure, could enhance Australia's wholesale financial markets. The RBA remains focused on wholesale applications, having found limited economic justification for a retail digital currency. Expected benefits include lower risks, improved transparency, better collateral efficiency, and cost reductions.</p>
