2025-07-10T10:53:51,"Bhutan government wallets move BTC in likely profit taking at new ATH","The Royal Government of Bhutan has moved over $23 million worth of Bitcoin to Binance, just as Bitcoin breached its previous all-time high level to trade above $112,000. According to blockchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence, Bhutan’s sovereign investment arm, Druk Holding and Investments (DHI), transferred 213.5 BTC, valued at $23.73 million, to a Binance deposit address on Wednesday. It is the second week in a row that the nation has made a significant transfer to the exchange, likely to sell. The transactions came at a time when Bitcoin hit $112,052 after seven weeks of consolidating between $105,000-$111,000. According to Coingecko data, the largest coin by market cap recorded over $60 billion in global trading volume in the last 24 hours. Bhutan week-on-week portfolio gains Arkham’s tracking data shows that Bhutan’s overall crypto portfolio rose to $1.304 billion on July 10, up from $1.26 billion a week earlier. The government’s net gain over that period stood at $38.4 million, largely due to a week of bullish market conditions that saw most coins trade in the green. As of July 3, the government held 11.93K BTC valued at $1.26 billion, with each coin priced at roughly $105,690. By July 10, Bitcoin’s value had climbed to $111,268, pushing the total value of Bhutan’s holdings to $1.3 billion. Royal Government of Bhutan holdings. Source: Arkham Intelligence The amount of Bitcoin held is still the same, indicating that while 213.5 BTC was sent to Binance, additional BTC might have been mined or moved between internal wallets. Other assets in Bhutan’s portfolio include 656 Ethereum, which increased in value from $1.58 million to $1.71 million after prices rose from $2,405 to $2,791.53 during the same period. Bhutan still recorded an appreciation of over $130,000 in valuation without increasing or reducing its ETH holdings. Several smaller assets in Bhutan’s wallet also registered meager gains. These include AIKEK, whose value rose from $43.33 to $50.68, and KIBSHI, which increased from $116 to $165. BOBO, a memecoin with 69 million units held, gained around $3.60 in valuation during the week. The government expanded its mining footprint in 2023 through a partnership with Singapore-based mining firm Bitdeer. Together, they launched a 600-megawatt mining facility in Gedu, located on the grounds of a failed $1 billion education infrastructure project. Old wallets move holdings to exchanges: More profit-taking? The government’s recent BTC wallet activity comes against the backdrop of several long-dormant Bitcoin wallets moving their holdings to exchanges. On-chain data from CryptoQuant revealed that older Bitcoin holdings, dormant for seven to ten years, have started to move, which analysts call an indicator of profit-taking. Just last week, two wallets from the Satoshi era moved 20,000 BTC valued at $2.18 billion. These coins had not been touched in 14 years. Moreover, derivatives market data from Binance showed there was an uptick in short liquidations and leveraged buying activity during Bitcoin’s rally past $112,000. Net Taker Volume measured by a seven-hour moving average has exceeded the $100 million mark. Bitcoin Net Taker Volume: Source: CryptoQuant Much of the trading volume may have been driven by forced market buys after short sellers were liquidated, and their open positions were converted into buy orders that pushed prices upward. Binance’s perpetual futures funding rate also spiked to +0.01 percent, the highest level seen since late June. The funding rate is the cost of holding long versus short positions in perpetual contracts, and its acceleration on the upside could mean there’s more demand for leveraged long exposure at current market conditions.

2025-07-10T10:51:56,"Analyst Says Altcoins Will Pump Hard if Bitcoin Drops Below This Level","A recent tweet by crypto update platform Ash Crypto has highlighted the current technical state of Bitcoin’s dominance in the overall cryptocurrency market. In the tweet, Ash Crypto stated , “BITCOIN DOMINANCE IS FORMING BEARISH PATTERN AND IF IT DROPS BELOW 65% ALTCOINS WILL PUMP HARD.” This statement was accompanied by a technical chart indicating a visible descending triangle pattern, often interpreted by analysts as a bearish formation in market structure. The attached chart shows Bitcoin’s market cap dominance hovering at approximately 65.08%, down slightly by 0.18%. The pattern includes lower highs and horizontal support along the 65% level, forming a descending triangle that has historically indicated a higher probability of a breakdown when it appears at the top of an uptrend. The dominance chart covers a 4-hour timeframe and illustrates a consolidation structure that appears to be nearing its critical breakout or breakdown point. A break below the horizontal support trendline may signal a shift in market sentiment from Bitcoin toward altcoins. BITCOIN DOMINANCE IS FORMING BEARISH PATTERN AND IF IT DROPS BELOW 65% ALTCOINS WILL PUMP HARD pic.twitter.com/fHc2HN0dmR — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) July 8, 2025 Community Analysts Highlight Technical Breakdown and Altcoin Implications Commentators on the tweet echoed the technical implications suggested by Ash Crypto. Isabella Moreira emphasized the significance of the 65% threshold, stating , “This breakdown in BTC dominance is technically significant. If the 65% level fails, we could see major capital rotation into altcoins. Altseason might be closer than most think.” Her view aligns with the broader market interpretation that declining Bitcoin dominance typically corresponds with a rise in the relative value of altcoins , as capital shifts away from Bitcoin and into other digital assets. Another market observer, Reijer, noted the technical structure as a “descending triangle,” explaining that this pattern “in most cases… will break out to the downside.” He added, “That would be very bullish for ALTs indeed,” reinforcing the sentiment that altcoin markets stand to benefit from a breakdown in Bitcoin dominance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Implications of a Drop Below 65% The 65% level in Bitcoin market dominance has historically acted as a strong support zone. A decisive drop below this threshold would likely signal a redistribution of market value away from Bitcoin , providing upward momentum to altcoins. Such a shift often coincides with increased volatility in mid-cap and low-cap cryptocurrencies, driven by investor speculation and capital rotation strategies. If Bitcoin dominance falls below the 65% mark, it could serve as a technical confirmation of the start of a new phase of altcoin performance. Traders and investors tracking market rotation typically interpret declining BTC dominance as a potential precursor to an altseason, a market period where altcoins significantly outperform Bitcoin in terms of price gains. Ash Crypto’s analysis highlights a bearish pattern forming in Bitcoin dominance, with multiple technical signals suggesting an impending breakdown below the key 65% level. Observers like Isabella Moreira and Reijer support this outlook with their commentary, reinforcing the idea that the altcoin market may soon gain momentum. As the descending triangle nears its apex, market participants will be closely watching the behavior of Bitcoin dominance around this critical support to assess whether altcoins will enter a sustained period of growth.

2025-07-10T10:50:56,"Bitcoin: Unprecedented Surge Sees 125 Publicly Traded Companies Hold $91B in Q2","Are you ready for a seismic shift in the financial landscape? The latest data reveals a groundbreaking trend: corporate Bitcoin adoption is not just a buzzword, it’s a rapidly accelerating reality. As of June 30, a staggering 125 publicly traded companies globally have amassed a combined 847,000 Bitcoin (BTC). This monumental figure represents 4.03% of Bitcoin’s total supply, valued at an astounding $91 billion. What’s even more remarkable? The second quarter of 2025 alone saw these firms add a record 159,000 BTC, with 46 new companies joining the ranks of corporate Bitcoin holders. This isn’t just news; it’s a clear signal that the world’s most prominent businesses are increasingly embracing digital assets. The Unstoppable Rise of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption The journey of Bitcoin from a niche digital currency to a significant corporate treasury asset has been nothing short of phenomenal. What began with a few pioneering companies has now blossomed into a widespread movement. The report by Bitwise, cited by JinSe Finance, paints a vivid picture of this accelerating trend. We’re talking about a significant portion of Bitcoin’s finite supply now being held by entities that traditionally focused on more conventional assets. Consider these key figures: Total Companies: 125 publicly traded firms. Total Bitcoin Held: 847,000 BTC. Percentage of Total Supply: 4.03%. Approximate Value: $91 billion (as of June 30). Q2 2025 Additions: A record 159,000 BTC. New Entrants in Q2: 46 companies. These numbers aren’t just statistics; they represent a growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its role as a strategic asset. The influx of new firms in just one quarter underscores a significant shift in corporate financial strategy, moving beyond traditional reserves to include digital assets. Why Are Publicly Traded Companies Betting Big on Bitcoin? The decision for a publicly traded company to allocate a portion of its treasury to Bitcoin is not made lightly. It involves extensive due diligence, risk assessment, and a forward-looking vision. So, what’s driving this significant pivot? Several compelling factors contribute to this growing appetite for Bitcoin among corporate giants: Inflation Hedge: In an era of increasing monetary expansion and inflation concerns, Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it an attractive hedge against currency debasement. Companies view it as a store of value, similar to digital gold. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate balance sheet provides diversification away from traditional fiat currencies and conventional financial instruments, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Potential for Appreciation: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has historically offered substantial returns over the long term, outperforming many traditional assets. Companies are positioning themselves to benefit from future price appreciation. Strategic Advantage: Early adoption can position a company as innovative and forward-thinking, appealing to a new generation of investors and customers who are increasingly crypto-savvy. Balance Sheet Optimization: For some, holding Bitcoin is a way to optimize capital, especially in low-interest-rate environments where traditional cash holdings yield minimal returns. Companies like MicroStrategy, a pioneer in this space, have openly discussed their rationale, emphasizing Bitcoin’s potential as a superior treasury reserve asset. Their success, despite market fluctuations, has likely encouraged others to explore similar strategies. Understanding the Mechanics: How Bitcoin Holdings Impact Corporate Strategy While the benefits are clear, integrating Bitcoin into a corporate treasury comes with its own set of challenges and considerations. Companies must navigate a complex landscape of volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and accounting standards. Key aspects companies consider when managing their Bitcoin holdings: Volatility Management: Implementing robust risk management strategies to mitigate the impact of Bitcoin’s price swings. This might include dollar-cost averaging, holding long-term, or utilizing hedging instruments. Regulatory Compliance: Adhering to evolving regulations across different jurisdictions regarding digital asset ownership, reporting, and taxation. This is a dynamic area requiring constant vigilance. Accounting Treatment: Understanding and applying the appropriate accounting standards for digital assets, which can vary and impact financial statements. Security: Ensuring the highest level of security for their Bitcoin assets, often through institutional-grade custodianship solutions that offer cold storage and multi-signature protocols. Public Perception: Managing stakeholder expectations and communicating the rationale behind their Bitcoin strategy to investors, employees, and the public. The rise of specialized service providers catering to institutional Bitcoin needs – from custody solutions to prime brokerage services – has made it easier for corporations to manage these complexities, paving the way for broader adoption. What Does This Institutional Bitcoin Trend Mean for the Future? The growing embrace of Bitcoin by publicly traded companies is more than just a fleeting trend; it signifies a profound shift in how corporations view and manage their assets. This institutional Bitcoin adoption has far-reaching implications for the broader financial ecosystem. Consider the potential impacts: Increased Market Stability: As more institutional capital enters the market, it could potentially lead to reduced volatility over the long term, as these entities tend to be long-term holders. Mainstream Acceptance: Corporate adoption lends significant credibility to Bitcoin, pushing it further into the mainstream and encouraging retail investors and even other corporations to consider it. Regulatory Clarity: The increasing presence of institutional players often prompts regulators to provide clearer guidelines and frameworks, which can further de-risk the asset class. Innovation in Financial Products: The demand from corporations is driving the development of new financial products and services tailored for digital assets, such as Bitcoin ETFs and sophisticated custody solutions. Redefinition of Treasury Management: Corporate treasury departments may increasingly view digital assets as a standard component of a diversified reserve strategy, alongside traditional currencies and bonds. This trend suggests that Bitcoin is not just surviving but thriving, solidifying its position as a legitimate and increasingly indispensable asset in the global financial landscape. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Era of Crypto Investment For individual investors and companies alike, the surge in corporate Bitcoin holdings offers valuable insights into the evolving world of crypto investment . Understanding this landscape can help in making informed decisions. Here are some actionable takeaways: For Individual Investors: Research is Key: Understand the fundamentals of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Don’t invest based on hype. Long-Term Perspective: Many corporate holders view Bitcoin as a long-term strategic asset. Consider a similar patient approach. Diversify: While Bitcoin is strong, a diversified portfolio across different asset classes is always prudent. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments and institutional movements, as they often signal broader market trends. For Companies Considering Adoption: Due Diligence: Conduct thorough research into the legal, accounting, and tax implications of holding Bitcoin in your jurisdiction. Risk Assessment: Clearly define your risk tolerance and develop a comprehensive strategy for managing Bitcoin’s volatility. Expert Consultation: Engage with legal, financial, and cybersecurity experts specializing in digital assets to ensure compliance and security. Phased Approach: Consider starting with a smaller allocation to test the waters and gradually increase exposure as comfort and expertise grow. The current environment indicates that the momentum for digital assets, particularly Bitcoin, within corporate treasuries is set to continue, making it a critical area of focus for anyone involved in finance or investment. The narrative is clear: Bitcoin is no longer just a fringe asset. With 125 publicly traded companies holding a combined $91 billion in Bitcoin, and a record influx of new firms in Q2 2025, the institutional embrace is undeniable. This powerful trend signals a growing confidence in Bitcoin’s role as a store of value, an inflation hedge, and a strategic asset for the future. As more corporations integrate Bitcoin into their balance sheets, its legitimacy and influence in the global financial system will only continue to expand, shaping a new era of corporate treasury management and investment.

At the same time, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has decreased by 0.9% to $3.45 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $128 billion, significantly up from $82.5 billion seen yesterday. TLDR: The crypto market is still surging, with 97 of the top 100 coins turning green; BTC jumped towards a new ATH, while ETH saw the highest increase among the top 10 for the second day in a row; The sentiment moved upwards towards greed territory; US BTC spot ETFs’ inflows jumped to $218.04 million today; US ETH ETFs saw inflows of $211.32 million – the second-highest amount in over five months; “There is still a lot of money sidelined and waiting to be deployed,” which will push prices higher; ”July will test markets, but Bitcoin looks built for it.” Crypto Winners & Losers The crypto market has continued the green streak, with all top 10 coins per market cap rising today. Bitcoin (BTC) is up 2.2%, currently trading at $111,250. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) is the category’s best performer for the second day in a row. It appreciated by 3.1%, currently changing hands at $2,794. The second-highest rise is Dogecoin (DOGE)’s 5.1% to the price of $0.181. Moreover, only three of the top 100 coins are red today. Leo Token (LEO) , Aaave (AAVE) , and Gate (GT) fell by 1%, 0.8%, and 0.6% to $8.96, $297.69, and $16.09, respectively. On the other hand, Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) is the category’s best performer, having appreciated 28.3% to the price of $0.01829. It’s followed by Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) , which is the only other coin with a double-digit increase. It’s up 12% to $1.62. Meanwhile, BTC’s price surged yesterday from the $109,000 level towards $112,000. This was partly the result of the $56.8 billion trading volume. The market cap is unshaken by recent events that were pushing the price down, holding above $2 trillion, signaling strong interest. Bitcoin just ripped +2.7% out of a textbook triangle breakout.

Roshan Roberts, CEO of OKX US , argued that “Bitcoin is showing why it’s in a class of its own. As trade tensions flare and altcoins stumble, institutions are treating BTC as a macro hedge and a maturing asset class.” Roberts says that “July will test markets, but Bitcoin looks built for it.” Additionally, Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, co-founder and CSO of Ledn , said that BTC’s surge is the result of “relentless demand from investors and corporations.” In the last 30 days alone, at least 21 companies have announced new plans to raise and deploy an estimated $3.5 billion into their BTC treasuries, he says. They have bought 6,745 BTC, which is some 20% of their planned purchases. He added that “there is still a lot of money sidelined and waiting to be deployed. If this trend continues, we may see Bitcoin price move much higher from here,” Di Bartolomeo argued. Meanwhile, analysts are debating if we’re about to see an actual breakout or not. As the coin stopped just shy of breaking the high, there may be a pullback next. Overall, many still argue that new all-time highs are near. $BTC Plan for me is straight forward here. Either: A) We're about to see a *true* breakout. In which case we see acceptance above this range (daily close above, time and space, any re-tests are support, etc).

BTC holding this level firmly would validate the latest breakout. A drop below and towards the $109,850 level could lead to additional falls. That said, the coin may also retest the $112,000 zone.

Fidelity , Grayscale , Bitwise , Valkyrie , and Invesco also saw positive flows between $2 million and $16 million. On the same day, US ETH ETFs saw inflows surge to $211.32 million , up from less than $47 million a day prior. This is the second-highest amount in over five months. Of this amount, BlackRock’s is $158.62 million. Grayscale ($17.96m), Fidelity ($29.53m), and Franklin ($5.21m) also recorded inflows. Meanwhile, during a 9 July hearing, US Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott urged the lawmakers in that country to advance key crypto market structure legislation . “Today’s hearing is the first full committee hearing on digital assets,” Scott said. “This is a crucial step toward developing a comprehensive framework that gives innovators the clarity they need and gives investors the protections they deserve.” He continued: “Make no mistake: blockchain technology and digital assets are not going away – they are here to stay.” Additionally, Elizabeth Warren, Ranking Member of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, proposed her crypto market legislation framework during this hearing. She devised a list of five priorities to “guide” the legislative process while developing crypto policy. Quick FAQ Why did crypto move with stocks today? The crypto market saw a notable increase over the past 24 hours, as did the US stock market on Wednesday, despite enduring uncertainty about US trade policy. For example, the S&P 500 rose by 0.61%, the Nasdaq-100 increased by 0.72%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up by 0.49%. Is this rally sustainable? Short answer: long-term, yes. Analysts argue that the prices will continue to increase in the mid and long term, but these increases will be followed by typical pullbacks. So far, there is no sign of an incoming bear.

2025-07-10T10:40:57,"Ziglu Crisis: UK Crypto Platform Unravels Amid Financial Distress","The crypto world is no stranger to volatility, but when a prominent platform faces severe financial distress, it sends ripples through the community. That’s precisely what’s happening with Ziglu , a UK-based digital banking and crypto platform, which has now officially entered special administration. This development, reported by Crowdfund Insider, marks a critical juncture for the company and its users, highlighting the ongoing challenges in the evolving crypto landscape. Understanding Ziglu’s Financial Distress: What Went Wrong? For months, signs of trouble had been brewing at Ziglu. The company, once a promising name in the UK crypto scene, found itself in a precarious financial position. This wasn’t a sudden collapse but rather a culmination of factors, including broader market downturns and specific regulatory hurdles. The severity of its financial distress ultimately led to the drastic step of seeking special administration, a process designed to manage the affairs of a struggling financial institution. A key turning point came in June when the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) imposed significant operational restrictions on Ziglu. These restrictions were a direct response to the company’s financial state and regulatory compliance. The immediate consequences were severe: Freezing of “Boost” Accounts: Ziglu’s yield-generating “Boost” accounts, which offered users returns on their crypto holdings, were immediately frozen. This move directly impacted users expecting passive income from their assets. Suspension of Services: Both e-money and crypto services were suspended, effectively halting all new deposits, withdrawals, and trading activities on the platform. These actions by the FCA underscore the regulator’s commitment to protecting consumers, even if it means disrupting services in the short term. For Ziglu, it meant a severe curtailment of its operations, pushing it further into financial instability. The Impact of FCA Restrictions on UK Crypto Operations The intervention by the FCA restrictions served as a stark reminder of the evolving regulatory environment for digital asset firms in the UK. The FCA’s role is to ensure market integrity and consumer protection, and its actions against Ziglu demonstrate its willingness to enforce these principles. For a crypto platform, having its operations restricted by a major financial regulator can be a death knell, as it erodes user trust and severely limits revenue streams. The situation also highlights a broader trend: the increasing scrutiny faced by crypto companies globally. Regulators are keen to bring digital asset services within existing financial frameworks, often leading to stricter compliance requirements. While beneficial for long-term stability and investor confidence, this transition period can be particularly challenging for startups like Ziglu that might struggle to meet stringent capital and operational standards. The Unraveling Robinhood Acquisition and Its Aftermath Adding another layer of complexity to Ziglu’s woes was the highly anticipated, yet ultimately failed, Robinhood acquisition . Earlier, there were strong indications that U.S.-based trading giant Robinhood was poised to acquire Ziglu, a deal that would have provided a much-needed lifeline and a significant exit opportunity for Ziglu’s investors and founders. Robinhood, known for its commission-free trading, had been looking to expand its international footprint, and Ziglu seemed like a strategic fit for its foray into the UK market. However, Robinhood ultimately pulled out of the deal. While the exact reasons for the withdrawal were not publicly disclosed, it’s highly probable that the deteriorating market conditions, coupled with Ziglu’s growing financial distress and the looming FCA restrictions, played a significant role. The collapse of this acquisition was a devastating blow, removing the most viable path to recovery and leaving Ziglu without a strategic partner or the crucial capital injection it desperately needed. This failed deal underscores the fragility of mergers and acquisitions in the volatile crypto space, where market conditions and regulatory landscapes can shift rapidly, altering the viability of even well-advanced negotiations. Navigating Special Administration: What It Means for Ziglu Users With Ziglu now in special administration , the focus shifts to the administrators appointed to manage the company’s affairs. Special administration is a specific insolvency regime for investment firms in the UK, designed to ensure that client assets are returned as quickly and efficiently as possible, while also maximizing returns for creditors. For Ziglu users, the most pressing concern is the fate of their assets. The company is currently urging users to withdraw their assets from wallets and accounts. This is a critical step, and users should act promptly. However, there’s ongoing uncertainty over the timeline and feasibility of these withdrawals, especially for funds held in frozen “Boost” accounts. It’s important for users to: Check Official Communications: Regularly monitor official announcements from Ziglu and the appointed administrators for instructions and updates. Attempt Withdrawals: Follow any instructions provided to withdraw assets from their accounts. Document Holdings: Keep detailed records of their account balances and any attempted transactions. Seek Independent Advice: If in doubt, consult with financial or legal professionals familiar with crypto insolvency. While special administration aims to protect client assets, the process can be complex and time-consuming. Users should prepare for potential delays and uncertainties regarding the full recovery of their funds, especially if those funds were part of yield-generating products not held in segregated client accounts. Broader Lessons for the UK Crypto Landscape The unfortunate situation with Ziglu serves as a crucial case study for the wider UK crypto industry. It highlights several key takeaways: Regulatory Scrutiny is Increasing: Firms operating in the UK must be prepared for rigorous oversight from the FCA. Compliance is not optional but fundamental to sustainable operation. Due Diligence is Paramount for Users: Users must exercise extreme caution and conduct thorough due diligence before entrusting their funds to any crypto platform, especially those offering high-yield products. Understanding how and where funds are held (e.g., segregated client accounts vs. company balance sheets) is vital. Market Volatility Impacts All: Even well-funded startups can be vulnerable to severe market downturns and the ripple effects they cause, including failed acquisitions and increased regulatory pressure.

""He Will Launch a New Altcoin!""","Truth Social, the social media company founded by US President Donald Trump, continues its cryptocurrency moves. At this point, Truth Social has finally signaled that it will launch a utility token tied to its premium subscription service, Patriot Package. According to Decrypt, Truth Social TV has announced plans to launch a token that will reward users as part of its streaming subscription package. In the near future, Patriot Pack subscribers will accumulate gems in their Truth Social accounts based on their level of engagement with the platforms. These will eventually be tied to a utility token across both Truth Social and Truth+. The company had previously stated in April that it was considering issuing a utility token. This isn't the first time Truth Social has announced its plans for cryptocurrencies, as it's taking major steps to expand its presence in the cryptocurrency space. At this point, the company last month filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF and a Bitcoin and Ethereum combo ETF. Earlier this week, the company filed with the SEC for a “Crypto Blue Chip” ETF that would consist of BTC, ETH, Solana (SOL), XRP, and CRO.

2025-07-10T10:32:51,"Bitcoin Legend Max Keiser Predicts BTC to Hit $220K in 2025","Veteran Bitcoin (BTC) evangelist Max Keiser has reignited bullish sentiment in the crypto community with a renewed call that the OG cryptocurrency will reach $220,000 before the end of 2025. In a series of posts on X, he stressed that his forecast, once seen as outlandish, now appears increasingly plausible, especially following BTC’s new all-time high of $112,152, reached just hours earlier. $220K BTC Call Gains New Momentum Keiser first floated his $220,000 prediction in December 2022 during an interview with Daniela Cambone. At the time, the digital asset market was caught in a debilitating “crypto winter,” with its overall value plummeting from $3 trillion to under $1 trillion and BTC sinking to five-digit lows. The former broadcaster is now circling back to the projection, pointing out that the price of Bitcoin has increased 700% since his sit-down with Cambone. “Bitcoin up 700% since this interview 2 years ago (and $220,000 in 2025 looks likely),” Keiser wrote on X. While skeptics challenged his thesis two years ago, BTC’s current price is lending it credibility. “$220,000 in 2025,” he reiterated in another post. The number one cryptocurrency recently chalked up a new all-time high, after initially surging past $109,000 following comments by U.S. President Donald Trump on July 9, demanding the Federal Reserve execute the “biggest interest rate cut in history.” Analysts at the Kobeissi Letter warned that such an unprecedented cut, while potentially saving $174 billion in near-term interest and slashing mortgage rates, could supercharge inflation, possibly benefiting riskier assets like Bitcoin. This macro bombshell shattered weeks of consolidation between $105,000 and $110,000, decisively propelling BTC past its old peak. Market intelligence firm Santiment pinpointed the breakout’s contrarian nature, noting it occurred precisely when “many retailers had been dropping out due to boredom or disbelief,” a classic signal of smart money accumulation preceding major rallies. Keiser Holds Back on Timing to Avoid Investor ‘Fear’ At the time of this writing, Bitcoin was trading near $111,090, and showing modest momentum, with gains of 2.1% in the last 24 hours and 1.8% over the past week. While Keiser’s $220,000 target remains highly ambitious, his conviction has been constant through the asset’s ups and downs. However, he has intriguingly hinted at withholding the precise timing of his prediction, suggesting the full picture might unsettle investors. “I pause before giving exact timing of price targets not to scare people,” Keiser admitted in one post, adding more emphatically in another, “If I gave you both the price and date most of you would be scared.” The post Bitcoin Legend Max Keiser Predicts BTC to Hit $220K in 2025 appeared first on CryptoPotato .",cryptopotato,https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-legend-max-keiser-predicts-btc-to-hit-220k-in-2025/,"BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|FIAT","AA News|BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|Bitcoin|Bitcoin Long-Term Prediction",cryptocompare
2025-07-10T10:30:49,"Bank of Korea Issues Crucial Warning on Non-Bank Won Stablecoins","Are you tracking the evolving landscape of digital currencies? The world of finance is abuzz with discussions around stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). In a significant development, the Bank of Korea has voiced strong concerns regarding the issuance of won stablecoins by non-banking entities. This stance sends a clear signal about the nation’s cautious approach to digital currency innovation, prioritizing financial stability and consumer protection. Understanding Won Stablecoins and Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) The rise of digital assets has brought forth new forms of currency, notably stablecoins. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins aim to maintain a stable value by pegging themselves to a reserve asset, often a fiat currency like the US dollar or the Korean Won. A won stablecoin , for instance, would be designed to hold a value equivalent to one Korean Won, typically backed by reserves of the same currency held by an issuer. However, the concept of a stablecoin issued by a private, non-banking entity raises distinct questions when compared to a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) . While both are digital representations of a national currency, their underlying structure, regulatory oversight, and implications for the broader financial system differ fundamentally. The Bank of Korea , through its Governor Rhee Chang-yong, highlights this crucial distinction. What’s the Core Difference? Issuer: Private stablecoins are issued by companies, sometimes outside traditional financial regulation. CBDCs are issued directly by the central bank. Backing: Private stablecoins rely on reserves held by the issuer, which may or may not be fully transparent or audited. CBDCs are direct liabilities of the central bank, carrying sovereign backing. Purpose: Private stablecoins often aim for faster, cheaper transactions and broader crypto ecosystem integration. CBDCs aim to modernize payment systems, enhance financial inclusion, and maintain monetary policy control. Why is the Bank of Korea Concerned About Non-Bank Won Stablecoins? Governor Rhee Chang-yong’s statement isn’t merely a cautionary note; it reflects deep-seated concerns shared by central banks globally regarding the potential risks posed by privately issued stablecoins, especially when they reach systemic importance. The problems he alludes to are multi-faceted, touching upon the very pillars of a nation’s economic health and its citizens’ financial well-being. Potential Pitfalls of Private Stablecoin Issuance: Threats to Financial Stability: Imagine a large-scale private stablecoin issuer facing a liquidity crisis or a ‘run’ on its reserves. This could trigger panic, leading to widespread redemptions and potentially destabilizing the broader financial system, much like a bank run. Without robust regulatory frameworks and oversight, such an event could have ripple effects across markets. Erosion of Monetary Policy Control: If a significant portion of transactions and savings migrate from traditional bank deposits to privately issued stablecoins, the central bank’s ability to influence interest rates, manage money supply, and conduct effective monetary policy could be severely hampered. This loss of control could undermine efforts to manage inflation or stimulate economic growth. Consumer Protection Risks: Unlike bank deposits, privately issued stablecoins typically lack the safety nets of deposit insurance schemes. If an issuer becomes insolvent, consumers could lose their funds. Furthermore, issues around transparency of reserves, operational resilience, and cybersecurity could expose users to significant risks. Challenges in Combating Illicit Finance: The decentralized nature and pseudonymous aspects of some stablecoin operations could make them attractive for money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit activities. Central banks and regulators face an uphill battle in enforcing Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) measures effectively without proper oversight. The Bank of Korea ‘s apprehension stems from a commitment to safeguarding the integrity and stability of the national currency and payment system. This is where the concept of a CBDC becomes paramount as a secure, reliable alternative. The Han River Project: Korea’s Path to a Secure Digital Currency In response to the evolving digital landscape and to address the very concerns raised about private stablecoins, the Bank of Korea has been actively pursuing its central bank digital currency initiative, known as the ‘Han River Project’. This project is not merely an experiment; it’s a strategic undertaking aimed at laying the groundwork for a future digital won that is both innovative and secure. Key Aspects of the Han River Project: Foundational Infrastructure: The project is designed to build a robust and resilient digital currency infrastructure that can support future financial innovations while ensuring stability. Security and Reliability: By issuing the digital won directly, the BOK aims to provide the highest level of security and reliability, backed by the full faith and credit of the central bank. This contrasts sharply with the potential risks associated with private stablecoin issuers. Phased Approach: The Han River Project has involved various phases, including technical feasibility studies, pilot programs, and simulations to test the practical applications and implications of a CBDC in a real-world scenario. Innovation Catalyst: While focused on stability, the CBDC is also viewed as a potential catalyst for innovation in payment systems, enabling new services and efficiencies within the financial sector. Governor Rhee’s statement underscores that the Han River Project is the ‘first step toward introducing secure and reliable won-based stablecoins.’ This implies that while private stablecoins are viewed with caution, the BOK acknowledges the demand for digital won-based instruments and seeks to fulfill this demand through a centrally controlled, secure mechanism. Global Implications for Digital Currency and Regulation The Bank of Korea ‘s stance is not isolated; it mirrors a growing trend among central banks worldwide grappling with the challenges and opportunities presented by digital currencies. From the European Central Bank’s exploration of a digital euro to China’s advanced digital yuan project, central banks are actively researching and developing their own CBDCs as a response to the digital revolution and as a means to maintain control over their monetary systems. A Global Balancing Act: Regulators globally are walking a tightrope between fostering innovation in the digital asset space and mitigating systemic risks. The debate often revolves around: Regulation vs. Prohibition: Should private stablecoins be banned, or can they be brought under a robust regulatory umbrella similar to traditional financial institutions? Interoperability: How can CBDCs and regulated private digital assets coexist and interact seamlessly within the broader financial ecosystem? Cross-Border Payments: Can CBDCs facilitate more efficient and secure international transactions, potentially reducing reliance on traditional correspondent banking? The Korean perspective adds another layer to this global dialogue, emphasizing the central bank’s role as the ultimate guarantor of financial stability in the digital era. What Does This Mean for the Future of Won Stablecoins and the Crypto Market? Governor Rhee’s remarks signal a clear direction for the future of won stablecoins in Korea. It’s highly probable that non-bank entities issuing such stablecoins will face significant regulatory hurdles, if not outright restrictions, in the coming years. The emphasis will likely shift towards central bank-issued digital won as the preferred and most secure form of digital national currency. Actionable Insights: For Crypto Businesses: Companies operating with won-pegged tokens should closely monitor BOK’s regulatory developments. The focus might shift towards integrating with future CBDC infrastructure rather than relying on privately issued stablecoins. For Investors: Be aware of the regulatory risks associated with privately issued stablecoins, especially those lacking clear oversight. The ‘secure and reliable’ label will increasingly apply to central bank-backed digital assets. For Policymakers: The BOK’s stance provides a case study for balancing innovation with risk management, highlighting the importance of a clear regulatory perimeter for all forms of digital currency . The trajectory seems clear: the Bank of Korea is committed to ensuring that any digital form of the won maintains the same level of trust, security, and stability as its physical counterpart, with the CBDC being the primary vehicle for achieving this goal. Concluding Thoughts: Navigating Korea’s Digital Currency Future The Bank of Korea’s strong position on non-bank issued won stablecoins underscores a global imperative: as the financial world digitizes, central banks are asserting their role as guardians of monetary sovereignty and financial stability . While private innovation is valued, the risks associated with unregulated digital currencies, particularly those purporting to be stable, are too significant to ignore. The Han River Project represents a proactive and pragmatic approach by the Bank of Korea to embrace digital transformation on its own terms, ensuring that the transition to a digital economy is secure, inclusive, and resilient. This stance will undoubtedly shape the landscape for digital assets in Korea, setting a precedent for how a major economy approaches the delicate balance between innovation and regulation in the age of digital money.

2025-07-10T10:20:25,"German firms split on the future of crypto payments.","German businesses are split in their expectations about the future of cryptocurrency as a means of payment, shows a large-scale study covering hundreds of companies registered in the Bundesrepublik. While nearly half of the interviewed organizations believe crypto payments will become a common phenomenon in the next decade, most remain skeptical about taking decentralized digital money for the goods and services they are offering. German firms undecided on crypto as payment tool The share of German companies accepting and spending cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) is still quite small, but many more think crypto payments will grow in the coming years, according to a new survey, carried out by the industry organization Bitkom. Almost half of the respondents, or 48%, believe payments with crypto will be common 10 years from now. Yet, only 2% are currently using them, and six out of a hundred are open to the option, the German crypto news outlet BTC Echo reported on Wednesday. A total of 602 entities, employing at least 20 people, have participated in the poll conducted by telephone between early March and mid-April, this year. A sizable majority (86%) do not plan to start accepting cryptocurrencies in the near future, citing high price volatility, risks of fraud, legal uncertainty, and lack of knowledge among the main reasons for their reserved attitude. Nevertheless, the study found that 12% of large companies, those with at least 500 employees, are considering the digital assets as a payment method, the authors noted. Frederic Meyer, a blockchain consultant working for Bitkom, remarked: “There is interest in blockchain and cryptocurrencies in the economy – particularly in the financial sector, concrete applications are currently making noticeable progress.” Founded in Berlin right before the turn of the century, the Bitkom association now represents over 2,200 firms involved in Germany’s digital economy. Among its members are more than 1,000 small and medium-sized enterprises, over 500 startups, half the 40 DAX companies, including global players, its website details. MiCA to shape future of crypto in Germany and Europe The future of cryptocurrencies and businesses built around them in Europe as a whole, not just the Federal Republic of Germany, will be largely determined by the implementation of the EU’s new Markets in Crypto Assets ( MiCA ) law. The adoption of the unified regulation in the European Union has been welcomed by representatives of the crypto sector as it seeks to standardize rules for digital asset activities and allows businesses to operate across the 27-strong bloc with a single license. Major crypto firms have already applied or acquired one in an EU member state. Last month, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, OKX, launched fully regulated trading platforms in Germany and neighboring Poland after obtaining MiCA authorization. The new regulations, which concern the issuance, custody, trading, and disclosure of crypto assets, have also posed challenges for market participants. Europe’s top Bitcoin ATM operator, Austria-based Kurant, recently halted services in Germany to prepare for the MiCA requirements. Authorities in Berlin have so far maintained a generally positive regulatory approach regarding crypto, including by offering a tax exemption for investors who hold Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) or other cryptocurrencies for more than a year. In April, the parties forming the new federal government led by Chancellor Friedrich Merz dropped a proposal to raise the tax on crypto investments, by removing the one-year holding period, from their coalition agreement ahead of taking office in May 2025. Bitkom’s Frederic Meyer suggested that Germany’s newly established Digital Ministry should appoint staff to focus specifically on the blockchain sector and even set up a dedicated department. “Only this way can business and the society tap into the technology’s potential,” the blockchain expert insisted.

2025-07-10T10:19:43,"Trader Predicts $150K After $112K Bitcoin ATH: Here Are the Best Presales to Rally","Milkroad co-founder launched a $150K prediction for Bitcoin after $BTC reached a new all-time high on Wednesday, trading at $112K. The trader doubled down on his June assessment , when he pointed at the ‘bullish cup and handle’ pattern, which is likely to pressure Bitcoin up the charts. The prediction comes after two weeks of consolidation, during which Bitcoin hovered around its $108K ceiling, making analysts concerned about the likelihood of another ATH. Well, now it’s happened and the Fear and Greed Index is finally pushing into green territory. Is a $150K Bitcoin Realistic in 2025? Analysts Say ‘Yes’ Bitfinex analysts noticed that traders are still cautious about buying Bitcoin at the current price: The lack of follow-through at the range highs, and recent drawdowns in aggregateopen interest and whale holdings, highlight growing caution, particularlyamong experienced market participants. — Bitfinex, Executive Summary, BTC Consolidates as Whales Ease Holdings and New Buyers Step in However, not all experts agree. Crypto analyst Matthew Hyland believes that Bitcoin’s downtrend is pretty much over and that ‘bulls are in control’ now. eToro analyst Josh Gilbert is of the same opinion, pointing at the fact that Bitcoin’s fate is no longer in the hands of retail investors, but institutions, showing a clear shift in who’s pushing the crypto market: Strong ETF inflows and a solid macro backdrop have helped drive market momentum, but perhaps the most crucial shift is who’s buying. —Josh Gilbert, Cointelegraph interview The $1.04B in ETF inflows in July alone, according to Farside data , supports his statements and so are the $234.02M in Bitcoin shorts being liquidated over the past 24 hours, based on Coinglass . More importantly, the market faces a $1.6B short wipeout if Bitcoin pushes to $155K, which, at this point, is more than likely. In this context, the crypto market is showing all signs of a coming bull breakthrough, which is likely to not only push Bitcoin to new ATHs, but fuel some of the best presales of 2025 as well. Here are three to keep your eyes on. 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) Auto-Snipes Hot Tokens from its Telegram Chat Snorter Token ($SNORT) is a Solana-based trading bot that operates in Telegram-only and scans the market to identify the hottest assets available. The Snorter Bot will snipe them as soon as liquidity appears, making it a great tool for opportunistic traders. Snorter Bot addresses the most pressing problems associated with manual coin hunting, including missed opportunities, the high risk of honeypots and rugpulls, and the high technical entry-level. The bot fixes these issues by doing all the heavy work for you, while centralizing everything in its personal Telegram chat. So, no more juggling browser extensions and third-party wallets. Snorter Bot also comes with a live scam alert to highlight suspicious projects and keep your funds safe. The presale started in May, 2025, and has already accumulated over $1.6M. $SNORT currently sits at $0.0977, but based on the project’s specifics and potential, we expect the token’s price to reach $0.94 post launch for a growth rate of 862%. By 2030, $SNORT could reach $3.2 5, with enough community support and adoption. This translates to a potential ROI of 3,226% if you invest at today’s price. If you want to join the FOMO train and support the project, head to the presale page, buy your $SNORT today , and consider joining the staking pool for the 219% dynamic APY. 2. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) to Upgrade the Bitcoin Ecosystem in 2025 Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is Bitcoin’s official Layer 2 upgrade that promises to upgrade Bitcoin’s ecosystem in terms of performance. The Layer 2 solution aims to unleash Bitcoin’s scalability, which is currently far below modern standards, with only 7 Transactions Per Second (TPS). The project relies on the Canonical Bridge and the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration to increase transaction speed and smart contract execution for a near-instant finality. The increase in performance will also lower transaction costs, making Bitcoin transactions faster and more cost-effective than ever. The presale launched in May, but has already gained over $2.2M, with $HYPER valued at $0.0122. Following successful implementation and widespread adoption, our analysts expect $HYPER to reach a post-launch 2025 price point of $0.32, for a growth rate of 2,225%. By 2030, $HYPER could get as high as $1.25 , delivering an ROI of 10,145%. This would turn a $100 investment into a $10,245 profit in just 5 years. These predictions are merely approximations based on the project’s perceived value, which means that $HYPER’s real price could get even higher over time. If you want to join the hype train, head to CoinFutures and check out the presale page to buy your $HYPERs today . Feel free to check out the 362% dynamic staking options while you’re there as well. 3. HEXYDOG ($HEXY) Brings Pet Care Into the Blockchain Ecosystem HEXYDOG ($HEXY) is a meme coin with real-world utility that aims to create a bridge between blockchain technology and real-world pet care systems. The project incorporates pet welfare into its tokenomics, reserving 25% for marketing and partnerships and charity and adoption, which translates into 5B tokens. This turns $HEXY into a digital asset with real-world value, allowing you to use it in designated pet stores for pet-related products, services, and accessories. The presale is fresh and has accumulated $488K so far. $HEXY sits at $0.0033, but it shows great post-launch promise, given the project’s scope and utility. If you want to become part of a project with a real-world positive impact or simply hunt profit, check out $HEXY on the official presale page . Will Bitcoin Reach $150K Soon? Based on Bitcoin’s recent chart performance, the new $112K ATH, and analyst predictions, we believe it’s likely that it will reach $150K by the end of 2025. Worst case scenario, we should get another ATH, with $115K being the most likely one soon. When that happens, keep your eyes on presales like Snorter Token ($SNORT) and Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) .

2025-07-10T10:15:07,"Veteran Trader Peter Brandt Is Long on Bitcoin (BTC), But There’s a Catch","TL;DR Peter Brandt remains bullish on bitcoin with ambitious targets, but alerted about the appearance of a bearish pattern. Despite optimistic predictions from multiple analysts, technical indicators such as a near-overbought RSI suggest that the asset’s rally might face short-term resistance. Watch Out for This Level Several hours ago, bitcoin (BTC) made history by tapping a new all-time high price of over $112,000. One prominent figure in the crypto industry who has commented on the asset’s recent performance is Peter Brandt. The veteran trader spotted the formation of an expanding inverted triangle on BTC’s price chart, arguing that it has “a higher rate of morphing or mortality” than a pattern like the horizontal pennant. Nonetheless, Brandt remains long on the asset, setting short-term targets of $120,958 and $134,886. Investors, though, should be cautious because, according to the trader, a decline under $107,000 “would suggest morphology.” An expanding inverted triangle is a pattern where price fluctuations become wider over time, forming higher highs and lower lows in a megaphone shape. It’s generally considered bearish, as it signals market instability and could result in a breakdown. On the contrary, a horizontal pennant is a consolidation pattern where the asset’s valuation drifts sideways after a significant move. It’s usually viewed as a bullish signal, assuming it follows an upward trend. Brandt is known as a proponent of the primary cryptocurrency. Just a few weeks ago, he recommended that people make monthly investments and allocate 80% of the capital to SPY (the ETF that tracks the S&P 500 Index) and the remaining 20% to BTC. Other Forecasts The X user CRYPTOWZRD is also optimistic that BTC could post additional gains in the near future , envisioning a rally to $132,500 based on the potential formation of an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. KALEO was even more optimistic, predicting a price explosion to $500,000. #Bitcoin / $BTC $500K IS A MAGNET pic.twitter.com/ni2oFVs9hf — K A L E O (@CryptoKaleo) July 9, 2025 Some indicators support the bullish theories. BTC’s exchange netflow has been predominantly negative over the last month, signaling a shift from centralized exchanges to self-custody methods, which reduces the immediate selling pressure. BTC Exchange Netflow, Source: CryptoQuant On the other hand, the asset’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is quite close to the bearish zone of 70.

2025-07-10T10:00:43,"Bitcoin (BTC) Retests $109K on July Rate Cut Hopes, While Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Prepares for a Big Price Leap in Phase 6","Recently, Bitcoin (BTC) retested $109,000, up 2.3% daily, with a $2.07T market cap, driven by hopes of a July Federal Reserve rate cut following weak U.S. payroll data. A bullish engulfing candle and $407M in ETF inflows, led by Fidelity’s $183.96M, signal a potential 1.3x rally to $140K. However, a hotter-than-expected jobs report, adding 147,000 nonfarm jobs, reduced rate cut odds to 4.7%, with resistance at $110,900 risking a drop to $105K. Trump’s pro-crypto policies and a weakening U.S. dollar further bolster sentiment, but volatility from macroeconomic data persists. With markets now increasingly confident about a Federal Reserve rate cut this July, momentum is pouring into digital assets across the board. Analysts remain bullish on BTC, but many investors are beginning to explore newer opportunities—especially those with more room to grow. And that’s exactly where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is starting to attract serious attention. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) With over $12.00 million already raised and more than 68% of Phase 5 tokens sold, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining fast among early-stage DeFi plays. The current token price sits at $0.03, but Phase 6 is set to raise it to $0.035—around 20% increase that marks an important shift toward its $0.06 listing. In a market where timing matters, this is shaping up to be one of the most critical entry windows for retail and institutional players alike. What separates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) from countless other altcoins is its focus on delivering real, usable DeFi mechanics—not just speculation. The platform is structured around two powerful lending engines: P2C (peer-to-contract) and P2P (peer-to-peer). In the P2C model, users deposit well-known assets (e.g., ETH, AVAX, USDC, DAI) into decentralized smart-contract pools. Borrowers can then take out overcollateralized loans—typically up to 70% LTV on ETH, 60% on AVAX, and lower for volatility-sensitive assets—with dynamic interest rates adjusted based on how much of the pool is in use. Lenders receive mtTokens, which represent their share of the pool and automatically accrue interest over time. Meanwhile, for volatile or niche tokens like DOGE, PEPE, SHIBA, and other similar assets, the P2P model provides flexibility: lenders and borrowers negotiate custom terms directly—collateral, loan amount, interest rate, duration—outside of pooled funds. This strategy isolates riskier assets from the main pools while allowing risk-tolerant participants to seek higher returns. Both models maintain non-custodial architecture, require overcollateralization, and employ smart contracts to enforce terms and trigger liquidations as needed, preserving systemic safety. Security Backed by CertiK, Whales, and Smart Forecasts Security and transparency have become essential in decentralized finance—and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is taking both seriously. The team has partnered with CertiK, one of the most trusted blockchain auditing firms in the industry. Their $50,000 Bug Bounty Program is now live, with rewards distributed across four severity levels: critical, major, minor, and low. This proactive initiative signals to both developers and investors that safety is not just a checkbox—it’s a long-term priority. This trust-driven approach is already drawing attention from major crypto holders. In late June, a prominent Ethereum (ETH) whale moved $150,000 into Mutuum Finance (MUTM), marking a clear shift from holding legacy assets into backing promising early-stage protocols. With over 13,000 current holders and rising, Mutuum is building a growing community of investors looking for scalable, yield-driven opportunities in DeFi. The market is also taking note. One respected crypto analyst—who accurately predicted Bitcoin (BTC)’s 2020 bull run—has now forecasted a post-listing price target of $0.70 for MUTM. That implies a 23x return from today’s price and highlights the momentum Mutuum is building ahead of its exchange debut. The team is also moving toward its beta launch, with a functional testnet experience expected to go live around the time the token lists. Coupled with a $100,000 giveaway and the platform’s integration with Layer-2 scaling, the user experience is being fine-tuned for lower costs, faster execution, and maximum access. As Bitcoin (BTC) continues its climb past $109K, long-term investors are now looking beyond the majors. In a market full of expensive bluechips, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as one of the few protocols under $0.04 with a working product, institutional-grade audit backing, and real lending mechanics ready to launch. Phase 6 is just around the corner—and it’s not waiting for anyone.

2025-07-10T10:00:24,"Bitcoin ETFs: US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Achieve Remarkable Fifth Consecutive Day of Inflows","The landscape of digital asset investment is witnessing a powerful surge, as U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs continue their impressive run. On July 9, these investment vehicles recorded a substantial $214.5 million in total net inflows, marking an extraordinary fifth consecutive trading day of positive flows, according to insights shared by Trader T on X. This sustained momentum signals a growing appetite among institutional and retail investors for regulated exposure to the world’s leading cryptocurrency. What’s Driving the Surge in Spot Bitcoin ETFs ? The recent performance of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs highlights a critical shift in how investors are approaching the cryptocurrency market. Unlike futures-based ETFs, spot ETFs directly hold Bitcoin, offering a more direct and often preferred method for gaining exposure without the complexities of direct crypto ownership. The consistent inflows suggest a confluence of factors at play: Increased Institutional Confidence: Major financial players are becoming more comfortable with Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Regulatory Clarity: The approval of these ETFs by the SEC has provided a stamp of legitimacy, reducing perceived risks for traditional investors. Accessibility and Ease: Investing in Bitcoin through an ETF is as simple as buying a stock, making it accessible to a broader audience. Diversification Benefits: Investors are increasingly looking to digital assets as a way to diversify traditional portfolios. Breaking Down the Latest Crypto Inflows : Who’s Leading the Pack? The $214.5 million in net crypto inflows on July 9 was not evenly distributed, with several key players leading the charge. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) once again demonstrated its dominance, attracting the lion’s share of new capital. Here’s a snapshot of the leading performers for the day: ETF Ticker Issuer Net Inflows (USD) IBIT BlackRock $124.38 million ARKB ARK Invest / 21Shares $56.96 million BTC (mini) Grayscale $15.83 million BTCO Invesco $9.48 million FBTC Fidelity $4.84 million BITB Bitwise $3.01 million The remaining ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day, indicating a focused concentration of capital towards these top-performing funds, yet contributing to the overall positive sentiment. How is Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Shaping the Market? The consistent inflows into institutional Bitcoin products are not just a daily statistic; they represent a fundamental shift in the market’s structure. As more large-scale investors allocate capital to Bitcoin via ETFs, several impacts become apparent: Increased Liquidity: Greater participation from institutions enhances market liquidity, potentially reducing volatility. Price Stability: While Bitcoin remains volatile, institutional presence can contribute to more stable price discovery over the long term. Mainstream Acceptance: The involvement of established financial giants like BlackRock and Fidelity lends significant credibility to Bitcoin, paving the way for broader public acceptance. Evolving Investment Strategies: Fund managers are integrating Bitcoin into diversified portfolios, recognizing its unique characteristics as a store of value and growth asset. This trend suggests that Bitcoin is moving beyond its niche as a speculative asset and cementing its place as a legitimate component of modern investment portfolios. What Does This Mean for Your Digital Asset Investment Strategy? For individuals and smaller investors, the sustained inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs offer valuable insights into the broader market sentiment and future trends in digital asset investment . Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Institutional Activity: Large inflows often precede or accompany significant price movements. Keeping an eye on ETF data can provide a pulse on institutional sentiment. Consider Diversification: While Bitcoin is a cornerstone, explore other digital assets that are gaining institutional traction or have strong fundamentals. Understand the Risks: Despite institutional adoption, the crypto market remains inherently volatile. Always conduct thorough research and invest only what you can afford to lose. Long-Term Perspective: The consistent inflows suggest a long-term bullish outlook from significant players, encouraging a patient, long-term approach to digital asset holdings. This growing embrace by traditional finance signifies a maturation of the cryptocurrency market, opening new avenues for strategic digital asset investment. The Future Trajectory for Bitcoin ETFs The positive momentum seen in Bitcoin ETFs is expected to continue, albeit with potential fluctuations. As the market matures and more regulatory frameworks solidify, we might see even greater innovation in crypto-related financial products. The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. could also pave the way for similar products in other major global markets, further expanding the reach of institutional Bitcoin investment. While challenges such as market volatility, evolving regulatory landscapes, and global economic shifts will always be factors, the underlying trend points towards continued integration of digital assets into mainstream finance. In conclusion, the consistent and significant net inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, culminating in five consecutive days of positive flows and $214.5 million on July 9, underscore a profound shift in the investment world. This trend reflects increasing institutional confidence, regulatory clarity, and a broader acceptance of Bitcoin as a valuable asset. As major players like BlackRock and ARK Invest continue to attract substantial capital, the impact on market liquidity, stability, and mainstream adoption of digital assets is undeniable. This ongoing institutional embrace is not merely a fleeting trend but a testament to Bitcoin’s growing prominence in the global financial landscape, offering a compelling narrative for both seasoned and new investors.

But legendary trader Peter Brandt says the rally isn’t guaranteed just yet. While he’s still holding a long position on BTC, Brandt warns that a drop below $107,000 could flip the script entirely. This is something you want to know. Read on! Breakout Pattern Spotted but It’s Not Without Risk Brandt’s latest chart shows Bitcoin breaking out from an expanding triangle, also called a broadening wedge. This pattern is marked by a rising lower trendline and an upper line that doesn’t converge. Basically, the price swings are getting wider, and so is the risk. While the breakout is encouraging, Brandt points out that expanding triangles often fail. That means there’s still a chance this move turns into a fakeout if support doesn’t hold. There is nothing special about this chart. An expanding inverted triangle has a higher rate of morphing or mortality than a pattern such a horizontal pennant. Nevertheless I am long BTC.

Now that level has flipped into support – a solid win for the bulls. But Brandt says the real line in the sand is $107,000. If Bitcoin dips below that, the current bullish pattern could fall apart. In his words, it might “morph” into something else entirely, likely a more bearish setup that could lead to a sharp pullback. Targets Ahead: $120K and $134K If Bulls Stay in Control Despite the warning, Brandt still sees upside if support holds. Based on the pattern’s range, he’s watching for price targets around $120,958 and $134,886. He previously predicted Bitcoin could climb as high as $118,000 in the near term, and that scenario is still in play. Right now, Bitcoin is trading around $112,288, holding above key levels, but not in the clear just yet. Bottom Line With over five decades of trading experience, Brandt knows how quickly markets can flip. He’s still bullish, but the message is clear: $107K is the must-hold level for this rally to continue. If it holds, Bitcoin could be gearing up for another leg higher.

2025-07-10T09:40:18,"El Salvador Bitcoin: Historic $400M Profit Triumph Under Nayib Bukele","Imagine a nation, against all odds and conventional financial wisdom, making a monumental bet on the future of digital currency. Now, imagine that bet paying off in a truly spectacular fashion. This isn’t a fantasy; it’s the compelling reality unfolding in El Salvador, where President Nayib Bukele recently unveiled an astounding nearly $400 million in unrealized profit from the country’s El Salvador Bitcoin holdings. This revelation isn’t just a headline; it’s a testament to a bold vision and a fascinating journey that continues to capture the world’s attention. Are you ready to dive into the story of how a small Central American nation is reshaping its financial destiny with Bitcoin? A Bold Vision Pays Off: The Astounding Bitcoin Profit President Nayib Bukele, a figure synonymous with El Salvador’s pioneering embrace of Bitcoin, took to X (formerly Twitter) to share a screenshot that sent ripples across the global financial landscape. The image proudly displayed an unrealized profit nearing $400 million from the nation’s substantial Bitcoin profit portfolio. As of the announcement, El Salvador held a remarkable 6,233.18 BTC, a digital treasure chest valued at approximately $692 million. This isn’t just about numbers; it’s about the vindication of a highly unconventional economic policy that faced widespread skepticism. But what exactly does “unrealized profit” mean? In simple terms, it refers to the gain in value of an investment that has not yet been sold. While the funds aren’t liquid cash in hand, they represent a significant increase in the original investment’s worth. For El Salvador, this signifies a powerful validation of their long-term conviction in Bitcoin’s potential. It’s a clear signal that their strategic accumulation, often during market dips, has yielded substantial returns. El Salvador’s Pioneering Journey: How Did They Get Here? The story of El Salvador Bitcoin adoption began in September 2021, when the nation made history by becoming the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. This audacious move, spearheaded by President Bukele, was met with a mix of excitement from crypto enthusiasts and grave warnings from international financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. Critics predicted economic instability, financial risk, and potential money laundering issues. Yet, El Salvador pressed on, driven by a vision of financial inclusion, reduced remittance fees for its citizens living abroad, and increased tourism and foreign investment. The government embarked on a strategy of accumulating Bitcoin, often buying the dip during periods of market downturn. This dollar-cost averaging approach, a common strategy among long-term investors, has evidently paid dividends. Their initial purchases were made at various price points, and while the exact average cost isn’t publicly disclosed, the current valuation clearly indicates a significant positive swing. Key Milestones in El Salvador’s Bitcoin Journey: September 2021: Bitcoin officially becomes legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar. Chivo Wallet Launch: A government-backed digital wallet introduced to facilitate Bitcoin transactions and adoption. Bitcoin City Concept: Plans announced for a tax-free “Bitcoin City” powered by geothermal energy from a volcano, funded by “Volcano Bonds.” Strategic Accumulation: Consistent purchases of Bitcoin, often during market corrections, demonstrating a long-term investment philosophy. The “Nayib Bukele Bitcoin” Effect: Leadership and Conviction At the heart of El Salvador’s Bitcoin experiment lies President Nayib Bukele. His charismatic and often unconventional leadership style has been instrumental in driving this bold policy. The “ Nayib Bukele Bitcoin ” strategy isn’t just about economic policy; it’s deeply intertwined with his personal conviction in the cryptocurrency’s transformative power. He has frequently used social media to announce Bitcoin purchases, celebrate price rallies, and engage directly with the global crypto community. This direct communication and unwavering belief have fostered a unique narrative around El Salvador’s journey. Bukele’s approach has been characterized by: Unwavering Conviction: Despite significant external pressure and internal skepticism, Bukele has consistently defended and promoted the Bitcoin initiative. Transparency (to an extent): While specific investment details remain private, Bukele’s public announcements of purchases and now, profits, have kept the world informed. Strategic Timing: The decision to buy during market downturns, often when fear was high, showcases a shrewd understanding of long-term market cycles. This leadership has not only put El Salvador on the global financial map but has also ignited debates about national sovereignty in monetary policy and the future of traditional finance. Beyond the Numbers: The Broader Impact of El Salvador Crypto The profit announcement is certainly impressive, but the impact of El Salvador Crypto adoption extends far beyond just the balance sheet. For ordinary Salvadorans, the journey has been one of adaptation and, for many, newfound financial access. The Chivo wallet, despite its initial teething problems, has facilitated remittances, allowing citizens to receive funds from abroad instantly and without hefty fees. This is a significant benefit for a country heavily reliant on remittances. Moreover, the Bitcoin initiative has positioned El Salvador as a hub for innovation and a destination for crypto enthusiasts and investors. Conferences, blockchain developers, and digital nomads are increasingly looking towards the Central American nation. This influx of interest, while still nascent, holds the potential for long-term economic diversification and growth, moving beyond traditional industries. Potential Benefits of National Crypto Adoption: Financial Inclusion: Providing banking services to the unbanked population. Reduced Remittance Costs: Saving millions annually for families receiving money from abroad. Increased Tourism & Investment: Attracting crypto-savvy individuals and businesses. Technological Innovation: Fostering a local blockchain and tech ecosystem. Monetary Sovereignty: Less reliance on traditional financial systems and foreign currencies. Navigating the Volatility: The National Bitcoin Strategy Moving Forward While the current news celebrates significant Bitcoin profit , it’s crucial to remember that the path has not been without its challenges. The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile, and El Salvador’s Bitcoin holdings have experienced significant dips, particularly during the 2022 bear market. At one point, the country’s portfolio was reportedly underwater, leading to renewed criticism and doubts. This latest announcement, however, underscores the importance of a long-term perspective and a robust national Bitcoin strategy . It highlights that short-term price fluctuations, while nerve-wracking, do not necessarily dictate the ultimate success or failure of a long-term investment. El Salvador’s commitment to holding its Bitcoin, rather than panic selling during downturns, has proven to be a key factor in reaching this profitable milestone. What does this mean for the future of El Salvador’s pioneering economic model? Continued Accumulation? It’s likely El Salvador will continue its dollar-cost averaging strategy, perhaps even accelerating purchases during future dips. Volcano Bonds: The successful realization of profits could bolster confidence in the planned “Volcano Bonds,” which aim to fund Bitcoin City. International Relations: The positive financial news might soften the stance of international financial bodies, or at least open new avenues for dialogue. Blueprint for Others? Other nations, particularly those in developing economies, will be watching El Salvador’s journey even more closely. Could this success story inspire similar initiatives? The true test of this national experiment will be its sustained impact on the lives of ordinary Salvadorans and its ability to weather future market cycles. Actionable Insights: What Can We Learn from El Salvador’s Triumph? El Salvador’s experience offers valuable lessons, not just for governments, but for individual investors and anyone interested in the future of finance. The core takeaways from this remarkable display of Bitcoin profit include: For Governments and Policymakers: Vision and Conviction: Pioneering new financial models requires strong leadership and a clear, unwavering vision, even in the face of significant opposition. Long-Term Perspective: Embracing volatile assets like Bitcoin necessitates a strategy that looks beyond short-term fluctuations and focuses on long-term growth potential. Financial Inclusion as a Driver: Leveraging new technologies to address existing socio-economic challenges can yield unexpected benefits. For Individual Investors: Dollar-Cost Averaging: El Salvador’s success reinforces the power of consistently investing a fixed amount over time, regardless of price, to mitigate volatility. Holding Through Volatility: Panic selling during bear markets often leads to missed opportunities. Conviction and patience can be richly rewarded. Research and Understanding: Before making significant investments, especially in nascent asset classes, thorough research is paramount. A Resounding Success Story: El Salvador’s Bitcoin Legacy The announcement of nearly $400 million in unrealized profit from El Salvador Bitcoin holdings is more than just a financial update; it’s a powerful narrative of courage, conviction, and a pioneering spirit. President Nayib Bukele’s audacious gamble has, for now, paid off handsomely, offering a compelling counter-narrative to the skepticism that initially surrounded El Salvador’s adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender.

2025-07-10T09:30:46,"XRP Forms Inverse Head And Shoulders Pattern, Why A Surge To $3.3 Is Possible","XRP has been one of the most-watched altcoins recently, with multiple developments emerging for its parent company, Ripple. However, while Ripple has seen a lot of positives, XRP has continued to struggle when it comes to price. Amid the selling, bulls have put up an impressive fight to hold the support above $2.2 for the time being. This has led to the formation of a new inverse head and shoulders pattern that could signal a reversal is coming. Analyst Highlights Bullish Formation For XRP Price Crypto analyst TheSignalyst, in a new analysis, showed that the XRP price has begun another bullish formation. This time around, it is the Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern that often precedes a surge for an asset. Not only has this formation come at a critical junction, it happened while bulls have maintained strong support levels. Related Reading: Altcoins Reclaim Trendline That Led To 2021 Explosion, Will History Repeat Itself? Through the market downtrend, the XRP price has been able to hold above $1.75 and $2, which the analyst points out as a major level. The return to this support level has brought a fresh wave of bullishness, and the XRP price could be ready for another uptrend from here. Presently, all eyes are on this support level, and TheSignalyst revealed that if XRP is able to hold this level, then the rally could be in motion. They point to the green neckline, which is shown in the chart as sitting just above $2.3, and this is the resistance that needs to be broken for the price to rally in the short term. For the long term, the analyst suggests that a clean break above the $2.66 level is needed. This is what would provide confirmation for a bullish continuation. If the setup holds, then the analyst puts the top of formation as high as $3.3 in the long term. Analysts Predict Higher Prices The calls for higher prices for XRP have grown louder, especially as investors have begun to make their bets once again. Analyst Crypto Virtuos pointed out that the XRP trading volume saw a notable uptick of 125% in a 24-hour period as interest ballooned once again. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash To $92,000 Or New ATHs? Analyst Explains The 2 Options Amid this rise in momentum, the crypto analyst, just like TheSignalyst, also explained that $2.3 is the hurdle that is holding the XRP price back now. Therefore, the cryptocurrency does need to overtake this level if it is to see a continuation of the uptrend. At the time of writing, the XRP price is still trending below $2.3, with sellers showing signs of exhaustion. Once the selling stops, then the bulls could trigger another upward wave to retest the resistance at $2.3 once again.

2025-07-10T09:30:00,"Bitcoin Depot Reveals 2024 Data Breach to Users","The breach took place in June of 2024, but was only recently made public due to an ongoing federal investigation. It compromised sensitive customer data including names, driver’s license numbers, and contact information. This incident now adds to a growing list of major hacks in 2025, including the recent $40 million GMX V1 exploit and the $1.4 billion Bybit hack earlier this year. Meanwhile, regulators are cracking down on crypto ATMs globally. In fact, New Zealand became the latest country to ban them entirely to combat money laundering. The city of Spokane in Washington State also enacted a full ban on crypto ATMs due to their use in defrauding vulnerable populations. Crypto ATM Giant Discloses 2024 Breach Bitcoin Depot, one of the largest crypto ATM operators in the United States, confirmed a data breach that compromised the personal information of almost 27,000 customers. The incident took place on June 23, 2024, but was only disclosed this week after the company received clearance from law enforcement. According to a notice that was filed with the attorneys general in Maine and Massachusetts, the breach affected 26,732 people and involved sensitive data, including names, phone numbers, driver's license numbers, and potentially addresses, birth dates, and email addresses. Part of the notice that was sent out to affected customers A Bitcoin Depot spokesperson shared that the notification delay was due to instructions from federal law enforcement, which were conducting an investigation into the breach. The company was only advised on June 13, 2025, that the investigation concluded and that it could begin notifying those affected. The breach was first detected in June of 2024, when the company noticed some unusual activity on its network. Bitcoin Depot immediately launched an investigation with a top cybersecurity firm, which confirmed on July 18, 2024, that an unauthorized party accessed files containing customer information. While the company claims there is no evidence that the stolen information was misused, it is urging customers to monitor their credit reports and consider placing fraud alerts or security freezes with major credit agencies. Bitcoin Depot says it has since taken steps to improve its cybersecurity infrastructure, including enhanced monitoring, increased internal awareness around data protection, and cooperation with law enforcement. This incident happened amid a series of high-profile data breaches in the crypto sector, including a December 2024 attack on Byte Federal that affected up to 58,000 users and a May 2025 breach at Coinbase, where hackers bribed third-party contractors and later demanded a $20 million ransom . Recent reports also indicate that more than 16 billion login credentials have been exposed this year alone, thanks to hackers targeting digital platforms with valuable user data. GMX V1 Hit by $40M Exploit Bitcoin Depot is certainly not alone in its struggles against crypto criminals. The GMX protocol halted trading on its GMX V1 platform after a major exploit that resulted in the theft of $40 million in digital assets. The breach affected a liquidity pool on the Arbitrum network that underpins the GMX V1 exchange. This pool included assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins. The stolen funds were then transferred to an unknown wallet. In response, the GMX team suspended minting and redemption of GLP tokens on both the Arbitrum and Avalanche networks as a precautionary measure. Users were advised to disable leverage trading and adjust their settings to stop minting GLP tokens. According to the GMX team, the exploit was isolated to GMX V1 and does not impact GMX V2, its associated markets, or the GMX token itself. Blockchain security firm SlowMist attributed the incident to a design flaw in the GLP token's pricing mechanism, which allowed attackers to manipulate the total assets under management and execute the exploit. This latest attack now only adds to the growing list of cybersecurity breaches in the crypto. Space, which already led to billions in losses. In the first half of 2025 alone, crypto hacks caused an estimated $2.5 billion in damages . A big portion of that, approximately $1.4 billion, stemmed from the Bybit hack in February. In another recent incident, Iranian crypto exchange Nobitex suffered over $81 million in losses due to a cyberattack by a group known as Gonjeshke Darande, forcing a temporary pause in services. To complicate things even more for the security landscape, the United States Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control announced sanctions on North Korean hacker Song Kum Hyok. The hacker is tied to state-affiliated cyber operations, and is accused of infiltrating cryptocurrency firms and defense contractors using social engineering and advanced breach tactics. New Zealand Bans Crypto ATMs Nationwide While exploits are causing problems for the crypto industry, crypto ATM’s are also starting to frustrate regulators. New Zealand even recently introduced a nationwide ban on cryptocurrency ATMs and imposed a $5,000 limit on international cash transfers as part of sweeping reforms that are specifically aimed at combating money laundering and organized financial crime. The measures were announced by Associate Justice Minister Nicole McKee, who explained that the government is very committed to targeting criminal activity while minimizing regulatory burdens for legitimate businesses. McKee stated that banning crypto ATMs will make it much harder for criminals to convert cash into high-risk digital assets, which are often used to conceal illicit transactions. Crypto ATMs The crackdown is part of the broader overhaul of New Zealand’s Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism regime. The reform package also grants the Financial Intelligence Unit expanded authority to request ongoing information from financial institutions about individuals flagged for suspicious activity. Two new legislative bills supporting these reforms are currently in parliament and are expected to pass by the end of the year. The goals of these laws are to reduce compliance complexity for honest businesses while also maintaining robust financial oversight. The government’s approach is informed by an April report from New Zealand’s Ministerial Advisory Group on Transnational, Serious and Organised Crime, which shed some light on the increasing use of crypto ATMs to launder money, particularly for drug trafficking and fraud. According to Coin ATM Radar , over 220 crypto kiosks are currently operating across the country, but all will be removed under the new rules. Bitcoin ATMs in New Zealand (Source: Coin ATM Radar ) New Zealand’s move is similar to the global trend of tightening controls around crypto ATMs. In Australia, the financial intelligence agency AUSTRAC recently introduced new restrictions on crypto ATM operations, including caps on cash deposits and stricter compliance requirements. Similarly, the city of Spokane in Washington State enacted a full ban on crypto ATMs, due to their use in defrauding vulnerable populations, particularly in low-income communities.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9878/bitcoin-depot-reveals-2024-data-breach-to-users,"BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|MX|ARB","News|Security",cryptocompare
2025-07-10T09:26:47,"Spot Bitcoin ETFs Attract Another $218M, Total Net Inflows Top $50B Since Launch","Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have now surpassed $50 billion in cumulative net inflows, less than two years since their debut in January 2024. Key Takeaways: Spot Bitcoin ETFs have surpassed $50 billion in net inflows just 18 months after launch. BlackRock’s IBIT leads the market, now holding over 700,000 BTC. Analysts expect SEC approval for Solana, XRP, and Litecoin ETFs soon. On July 9 alone, the market saw $218 million in net inflows, marking the fifth consecutive day of positive momentum, according to SoSoValue data . Over the past five trading days, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have pulled in nearly $1.52 billion. Bitcoin ETF Inflows Accelerate in July After Brief Setback Inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs have steadily accelerated throughout July following a brief setback After a $342 million net outflow on July 1, institutional appetite rebounded sharply, with daily inflows peaking at $601.94 million on July 3. Total net assets under management across all funds now sit at $139.39 billion. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) continues to dominate the landscape, amassing a net inflow of $53 billion. Fidelity’s FBTC follows with $12.29 billion. In contrast, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) remains the only fund with net outflows, losing $23.34 billion since its conversion. IBIT’s dominance was further cemented this week when it became the first ETF to hold over 700,000 BTC, now accounting for over 55% of all BTC held in U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. Remarkably, BlackRock is now reportedly earning more from IBIT than from its long-established iShares Core S&P 500 ETF. Commenting on IBIT’s explosive growth, Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, said recently that it has already become BlackRock’s third-highest revenue-generating ETF out of 1,197 products, surpassing even some of the firm’s flagship traditional funds. The nearly $75bil iShares Bitcoin ETF has only one month of outflows since Jan 2024 launch… Now generates more fee revenue for BlackRock than its largest ETF, the iShares S&P 500 ETF. Simply a machine. I offer a few thoughts here. via @isabelletanlee https://t.co/uDv6eiVb4b pic.twitter.com/pPwMQbfplW — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 3, 2025 As reported, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analysts have assigned a 95% chance that the SEC will approve spot ETFs for Solana, XRP, and Litecoin this year, raising their previous odds from 90% amid growing optimism for institutional crypto products. They also expect a crypto index ETF tracking multiple assets could gain approval as early as this week, signaling broader access to altcoins for traditional investors. Institutional Bitcoin Demand Shifts From ETFs to Corporate Treasuries Beyond ETFs, institutional Bitcoin demand is spreading into corporate treasuries. Japan’s Metaplanet recently bought $237 million worth of BTC , becoming the fifth-largest corporate holder with a stack exceeding 15,500 BTC. France’s The Blockchain Group and the UK’s Smarter Web Company also made new BTC treasury allocations this week, purchasing $12.5 million and $24.3 million worth of Bitcoin respectively. Remixpoint, a Tokyo-listed firm, raised $215 million to fund a planned accumulation of 3,000 BTC. Meanwhile, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $112,000 on Wednesday, triggering nearly $200 million in short liquidations. Ether followed closely behind, climbing 6.6% in 24 hours to trade at $2,778, with analysts predicting a potential breakout past $3,000 in the coming days.

2025-07-10T09:22:59,"This One Metric Suggests Bitcoin Has Plenty of Room Left to Run","Bitcoin (BTC) reached new all-time highs just above $112,000 on Wednesday, although the increase was only marginal compared to the previous peak. Despite the wave of bullish corporate adoption, with public companies adding bitcoin to their balance sheets . On-chain data suggests that bitcoin has more room to run when compared to previous cycle highs. One useful metric in this analysis is the MVRV Z-Score, which helps evaluate whether bitcoin is overvalued or undervalued relative to what could be considered its fair value. Unlike a traditional z-score, the MVRV Z-Score uniquely compares the market value to the realized value. When the market value, calculated as the network’s valuation based on the spot price multiplied by supply, sits significantly above the realized value, which reflects the cumulative capital inflow into the asset, this has historically signaled market tops [red zone]. Conversely, when the market value is well below the realized value, it has often indicated market bottoms [green zone]. The MVRV Z-Score is defined as the ratio between the difference of market cap and realized cap, and the standard deviation of market cap, expressed as [market cap minus realized cap] divided by the standard deviation of market cap. The standard deviation is calculated cumulatively from the first available data point to the present day, making it a long-term measure. Currently, the MVRV Z-Score sits at 2.4. In past bear market lows, bitcoin has registered scores below zero, as seen in 2015, 2019, and 2022. Meanwhile, cycle tops have historically occurred when the score reaches 7 or higher, as was the case in 2017 and 2021, according to Glassnode data. Although this is just one data point, it indicates that bitcoin still has significant potential for further upside compared to previous cycles.

At this point, the previous all-time high price record for Bitcoin was $111,900 according to the averages of cryptocurrency exchanges, and it renewed this record last night at $111,999 on Binance. As expectations for further increases increase with the new ATH, 10X Researxh founder Markus Thielen shared a new BTC prediction. Accordingly, Markus Thielen stated that Bitcoin could reach $133,000 by September. Bitcoin (BTC) is in an Uptrend! Thielen said Bitcoin could climb to $133,000 by September thanks to renewed bullish momentum and strong demand for call options. Thielen noted that 10X Research's trend models turned bullish on June 29, and according to this model, there is a 60% probability that the rise will continue over the next two months. At this point, Thielen stated that historical data linked to the model indicates a 20% increase from current levels near $111,000, which would take BTC to around $133,000. “We remain constructive on Bitcoin’s upside. Our trading signals suggest that the current short-term breakout carries a 60% probability of further upside over the next two months, while historical data suggests gains of around 20%. This means Bitcoin could reach $133,000 in September.” Finally, Thielen believes that while Q3 is generally a weak period for BTC, this cycle could challenge that trend. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-10T09:16:40,"Short Whale Liquidated for Over $50M as Bitcoin (BTC) Surged to New ATH (Market Watch)","After weeks of consolidation and a lack of actual volatility, bitcoin finally broke out yesterday and charted a new peak at $120,000 before it corrected slightly. Many altcoins have produced even more impressive price pumps in the past 24 hours, led by PENGU, WIF, and FARTCOIN. BTC’s Latest Peak Liqudates Massive Whale Recall that the primary cryptocurrency began the month with stagnation and even a brief correction that drove it to just over $105,000. However, it reacted well at this point, erased all losses, and even jumped past $110,000 a day later. It couldn’t maintain its run and returned to $108,000, where it spent most of the weekend. Monday started with another breakout attempt, but to no avail as the bears emerged at $109,600 and pushed it south. After another day of consolidation on Tuesday and most of Wednesday, the cryptocurrency finally shot up on Wednesday evening. Perhaps due to Donald Trump’s call for lower interest rates, BTC skyrocketed past $110,000 and continued climbing to break its previous all-time high, setting a new one at $112,000 (on most exchanges). Although it has retraced by about a grand since then, its move to the upside caused a painful liquidation for a certain whale. Data from CoinGlass shows that someone was wrecked for over $51 million yesterday. BTC’s market cap now stands above $2.210 trillion, while its dominance over the alts is down to 62.4%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts in Green The declining BTC dominance in times of price pumps means that alts have performed better, a lot better. This is evident from many larger-cap ones, such as ETH, which tapped $2,800 for the first time in weeks. DOGE, ADA, HYPE, SUI, XLM, AVAX, HBAR, and SHIB are also well in the green, with gains of up to 10-11%. The biggest increases come from some lower-cap alts, such as PENGU, which has skyrocketed by over 34% amid rumors of a spot ETF. WIF (15%) and FARTCOIN (13%) follow suit. The cumulative market cap of all crypto assets has risen by approximately $100 billion since yesterday and is up to $3.540 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

In a new interview with CNBC, Lee predicts the leading stock index could surge to 6,800 in the next few months, fueled by rate cuts from the U.S. Federal Reserve. “People always find quibbles with new highs, but we also know that for an institutional asset manager, it is not really excusable to be bearish when the market makes a new all-time high. So in other words, the institutions now have to start adding risk if we’re making all-time highs, because it’s a new bull market.” Lee says the FOMO (fear of missing out) trade is a component of the current market environment. “It’s merely a reorientation of perception, because the market’s only at 5% year-to-date, but we could be up 10%, so only half of the full-year gains have been realized, so if someone had fresh eyes on the market and knows the Fed’s being dovish and tariff risks are abating and multiples could expand, I think people could find many stocks to buy.” The S&P 500 set a new all-time high last week and is trading at 6,263.26 at time of writing. The index is up more than 0.6% in the past day and more than 1% in the past 5 days.

Table of Contents Coinpedia’s Cardano Price Prediction 2025 Cardano Price Today Cardano Price Prediction for July 2025 ADA Price Prediction 2025 Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Cardano Price Prediction 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Market Analysis FAQs Cardano Price Today Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $ 0.62889004 5.44% Market Cap $ 22,255,285,654.4531 Trading Volume $ 1,128,065,413.3116 Circulating Supply 35,388,198,743.3986 All-time High $3.10 on 02nd Sept 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on 02nd Oct 2017 Cardano Price Prediction for July 2025 The Cardano price is trapped in a long bleeding range in the entire H1 2025, but showed signs of recovery in late June, triggered by the ceasefire in the Iran-Israel-US short-term war. Over the last 20 days, it has recovered nearly 22% from the $0.55 support level. With the recent bullish momentum in the crypto sector during the second week of July, ADA price has been uplifted to $0.63 with growing hopes of an ADA ETF and global sentiment rising as BTC jumped beyond its June high. ADA is now inching towards the range’s upper border, and a sustained bullish momentum could lead to higher levels. The key level to watch in July is $0.72. If ADA holds and reclaims this level, a breakout above that range may lead to a rally toward $0.86, and if this resistance is cleared, ADA could aim for $1.10 by July end. However, failure to stay above $0.60 could send ADA back to $0.55, with a deeper decline possible toward $0.40. Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) July 2025 $0.40 $0.74 $1.10 ADA Price Prediction 2025 Source: coincarp Cardano has always prioritized decentralization, and the recent Plomin hard fork has taken it a step further. Unlike many other blockchains, Cardano gives more control to its users than to any central organization. This is reflected in CoinCarp’s rich list, where the top 100 addresses hold just 22% of the mainnet’s circulating supply, significantly lower than most other altcoins. To break above the $1.10–$1.20 range, strong retail participation will be key. A major catalyst could be the approval of an ADA ETF, expected by year-end, which could attract billions in inflows. If ADA holds above its Q1 2025 high, it has a strong chance of retesting the $2.05 mark before the year ends. Scenario Potential Low Average Price Potential High Without ETF Approval $0.85 $1.10 $1.25 With ETF Approval + Retail Surge $1.20 $1.65 $2.05 Bullish Breakout (with ETF & macro support) $1.50 $2.05 $2.80 Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) 2026 2.75 3.00 3.25 2027 4.50 4.75 5.00 2028 5.25 5.50 5.75 2029 6.75 7.25 7.75 2030 9.00 9.75 10.25 This table, based on historical movements, shows ADA prices to reach $10.25 by 2030 based on compounding market cap each year.

2025-07-10T09:12:19,"Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030: Will XRP Reach $5?","The post Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030: Will XRP Reach $5? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story Highlights Live XRP Price: $ 2.44436679 . Predictions suggest XRP could reach $5.05 by the end of 2025. Long-term projections show XRP could hit $26.50 by 2030 and $526 by 2050. XRP, one of the top five crypto assets known for its role in cross-border payments, is drawing increased attention as institutional adoption grows and its long-standing legal battle nears a conclusion. Since President Trump took office, Ripple XRP has gained significant traction, fueled by rising on-chain activity, bullish market sentiment, and increasing speculation around a potential XRP ETF Approval in 2025. With these developments in play, XRP price prediction is becoming a major focus for investors. Can XRP reach $100? Is a $500 target realistic in the long term? This article dives deep into XRP price prediction for 2025 and beyond through 2030.

We expect the XRP coin price to reach $5.81 in 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 XRP Price Today Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $ 2.44436679 4.58% Market cap $ 144,384,316,887.82 Circulating Supply 59,068,187,926.00 Trading Volume $ 5,661,918,581.5448 All-time high $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 XRP Crypto Price Prediction July In H1 2025, the XRP price action shifted from a decline to a consolidation phase. In Q2, after testing the upper boundary of a multi-month descending wedge at $2.65 in mid-May, it fell to hold above a key swing low support at $2.10. The upside potential has been limited due to worsening geopolitical conditions Many anticipated a catalyst on June 16th with a favorable lawsuit update, but it resulted in a 60-day pause in appeals. On June 17th, the SEC delayed Franklin Templeton’s XRP spot ETF amid geopolitical tensions. The U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites during the third weekend of June shook market sentiment completely, XRP dipping to $1.94, but a ceasefire in the fourth week helped the market rebound. Source: TradingView On June 23rd onwards, XRP climbed from $1.94, rising over 15% after the ceasefire announcement, turning it into a short-term battle. The fourth week was full of bullish developments, as Ripple’s CEO announced on June 28th that they would drop the cross-appeal against the SEC. Experts now expect, if the SEC also drops its appeal, it would formally conclude a four-year conflict. Investor sentiment has improved, showing less panic in short-term among traders. A strong “buy-the-dip” mentality has emerged amid the chaos. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, called Ripple’s recent decision a turning point, increasing the odds for XRP ETF approval, with BlackRock potentially entering soon . Meanwhile, another positive development in July reveals that Ripple has applied for a U.S. banking license , enhancing credibility. The sentiment has changed, and with market-wide optimism in early July, the falling wedge upper border aligned with a supply block near the key $2.40 resistance, breached in the second week of July as BTC crossed June’s high. Also, a short-term golden cross between the 20-day and 50-day EMAs has been established, indicating strong momentum. This time, a break above $2.60 could trigger a rally toward $2.95 in the short term, with a chance to retest the all-time high of $3.40 later in July. The last 20-day momentum is backed by growing investors’ interest, and positive developments fuel a rise in exchange outflow. Also, the technical tools on the XRP price chart show money inflows rising with CMF at 0.11, RSI above median at 68, MACD and histogram went bullish, indicating a sustained short-term rally. If XRP fails to sustain above $2.40 level, then a flash crash could also occur, pushing XRP’s price down. If selling pressure were to resume, the $2.10 support, which aligns with the 200-day EMA, is crucial, as losing grip at this mark could decline to $1.88 or even $1.63. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July 2025 $1.7 $2.45 $3.40 XRP Price Prediction 2025 Moreover, XRP has partnered with Wormhole to utilize its phenomenal cross-chain interoperability. Through this road in development, they seek a real-world adoption to boost. Therefore, consistent developments and crucial partnerships, If XRP manages to break above its all-time high of $3.40 in July 2025, after clearing the high-volume resistance zone at $2.40. Then odds are high that it could realistically target $5 by year-end. This potential rally would likely be fueled by growing optimism from banks, institutional investors, and the possibility of ETF approval which has highest odds in H2 of 2025. Source: TokenTerminal Adding to the bullish case, Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, is now integrated into its Ripple Payments system, and it is performing well per data from the token terminal. The transfer count has surged from 242 transfer counts to 3.1K transfer counts, holders count surged from 818 to 3.3K, and transfer volume grew from $88 million to $694 million, further solidifying its role in global finance. Notably, institutional dominance is strong as per coincarp , with the top 100 addresses holding 70% of XRP’s circulating supply, which is positioning XRP as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.

2025-07-10T09:10:19,"Cluely Unveils Strategic Shift: Why Roy Lee Isn’t Sweating Cheating Detectors","In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, where innovation often clashes with ethical concerns, Cluely has emerged as a particularly intriguing player. For those in the cryptocurrency space, where trust and transparency are paramount, the initial buzz around this AI startup might have raised eyebrows. Cluely, an AI tool designed to analyze online conversations via a hidden in-browser window, first gained notoriety for a controversial claim: its ‘undetectability’ feature supposedly allowed users to ‘cheat on everything.’ This bold assertion immediately positioned Cluely at the center of a heated debate about AI ethics and academic integrity. The Cluely Controversy: Roy Lee’s Bold Claims The story of Cluely and its co-founder, Roy Lee , is as captivating as it is contentious. Lee himself was suspended from Columbia University after openly admitting to using Cluely, then known as Interview Coder, to ‘cheat’ on a coding test for a developer position at Amazon. This personal anecdote, far from being a deterrent, became a central part of Cluely’s early marketing, creating significant buzz and drawing both fascination and condemnation. The company’s initial tagline, ‘cheat on everything,’ was a deliberate move, described by some as ‘rage-bait marketing,’ designed to capture attention and spark conversation. It certainly succeeded, but it also painted Cluely in a specific, often negative, light. Challenging the Undetectable: The Rise of Cheating Detectors The controversial nature of Cluely’s claims naturally led to a counter-response. On X, another Columbia University student, Patrick Shen, announced the launch of Truely, a product explicitly designed to catch ‘cheaters’ who use Cluely. Marketing itself as an ‘anti-Cluely,’ Truely claimed to detect unauthorized applications used during online meetings or interviews. This development seemed to set the stage for a technological arms race, where advanced AI tools for assistance would be met with equally advanced cheating detectors . Many observers expected Roy Lee and Cluely to be deeply concerned by this direct challenge to their ‘undetectability’ feature. Why Cluely’s Founder Isn’t Concerned About Detection Surprisingly, Truely’s launch did not faze Roy Lee . In a recent interview with Bitcoin World, Lee dismissed the notion that detectability was a core concern for Cluely . He stated, ‘We don’t care if we’re able to be detected or not. The invisibility function is not a core feature of Cluely. It’s a nifty add-on.’ Lee further elaborated that most enterprises, likely due to legal implications and the need for transparency, choose to disable the invisibility feature altogether. This statement marks a crucial turning point, indicating that the ‘cheating’ narrative, while effective for initial virality, was never the ultimate goal for Cluely’s long-term vision. Lee even praised Truely on X, while adding that Cluely ‘will likely start prompting our users to be much more transparent about usage,’ signaling a clear shift in strategy. Cluely’s Evolution: From ‘Cheating’ to Comprehensive AI Tools This strategic pivot became even more pronounced after Cluely secured a significant $15 million Series A funding round from Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) last month. With this substantial investment, Cluely has actively moved away from its provocative ‘cheating’ marketing. The company’s tagline has been subtly but significantly changed from ‘cheat on everything’ to ‘Everything You Need. Before You Ask. … This feels like cheating.’ This revised tagline acknowledges the perception of ease and advantage Cluely offers, but frames it within a context of legitimate utility rather than illicit activity. This re-branding positions Cluely not as a tool for deception, but as a powerful assistant that provides an almost unfair advantage due to its efficiency. Cluely’s Ambitious Vision: Beyond ChatGPT as an AI Startup Lee’s ambitions for Cluely extend far beyond merely being a tool for gaining an edge in specific scenarios. His grand vision is for Cluely to supersede ChatGPT and become the go-to AI tool for everyday information retrieval and interaction. ‘Every time you would reach for chatgpt.com, our goal is to create a world where you instead reach for Cluely,’ Lee declared. The key differentiator, according to Lee, is Cluely’s unique ability to understand context. Unlike ChatGPT, which operates largely in a vacuum, Cluely ‘also knows what’s on your screen and hears what’s going on in your audio.’ This contextual awareness, Lee believes, will make Cluely an indispensable assistant, capable of providing relevant information and insights proactively, based on a user’s real-time activities and conversations. This positions Cluely as a pioneering AI startup aiming for ubiquitous integration into digital workflows. In conclusion, Cluely’s journey from controversial ‘cheating’ tool to ambitious AI powerhouse highlights the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of tech innovation. Roy Lee’s steadfast focus on Cluely’s core utility, rather than its initial viral gimmick, demonstrates a clear strategic vision. The company’s shift in marketing, backed by significant venture capital, signals its intent to become a foundational AI tool, moving beyond the realm of mere detection evasion and into a future where AI proactively assists users with unparalleled contextual awareness. The debate around AI ethics will undoubtedly continue, but Cluely appears determined to carve out its place as a legitimate, powerful AI solution.

2025-07-10T09:05:48,"10X Capital Launches BNB Treasury Company Backed by YZi Labs","10X Capital has launched the BNB Treasury Company, backed by YZi Labs, creating an independent US initiative for digital asset treasury management that focuses exclusively on BNB Chain ecosystem investments. The company plans to pursue a public listing on a major U.S. stock exchange, providing American investors exposure to BNB, the world’s fourth-largest digital asset by market capitalization. 10X Capital is proud to announce a game changer, the first $BNB Treasury Company in the U.S. with the support of @YZiLabs , led by $GLXY co-founder David @Namdar , 10X CIO Russell Read, and @SaadNaja , formerly of @krakenfx . Stay Tuned! https://t.co/Lb4CC6YhaV — 10X Capital (@10XCapitalUSA) July 10, 2025 “Strategy” of the Binance Ecosystem The venture aims to replicate the success of Bitcoin treasury strategies pioneered by Strategy , targeting BNB’s $92 billion market cap and position as the native token of Binance’s ecosystem. Leadership includes digital assets veteran David Namdar, co-founder of Galaxy Digital and a former Millennium Management executive, alongside institutional investor Russell Read, a former CIO of CalPERS and the Alaska Permanent Fund. The announcement coincides with accelerating corporate adoption of BNB as a strategic reserve asset, led by Chinese firm Nano Labs’ $50 million acquisition of 74,315 BNB tokens at $672.45 per coin. Nano Labs plans to control 5-10% of BNB’s circulating supply through a $1 billion accumulation strategy using convertible notes and private placements. Additional corporate initiatives include hedge fund executives seeking $100 million to purchase BNB through Build & Build Corporation, marking the first Nasdaq-listed company to hold BNB on its balance sheet. The initiative, led by former Coral Capital Holdings executives Patrick Horsman, Joshua Kruger, and Jonathan Pasch, will also follow MicroStrategy’s business model for corporate Bitcoin accumulation. The fundraising targets are expected to be completed before the end of July. Corporate Treasury Revolution is Moving Away From Bitcoin-Only Strategy Nano Labs established itself as the first major public company to stockpile BNB at scale, bringing its total digital asset reserves to $160 million, which includes Bitcoin holdings. @NanoLabsLtd has entered into a $500 million convertible note agreement as part of a broader strategy to accumulate BNB worth up to $1 billion. #NanoLabs #BNB https://t.co/mPyfq9HiSQ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 24, 2025 The Hong Kong-listed company completed comprehensive evaluations of BNB’s utility , network security, and long-term investment potential before committing to the accumulation strategy. Even on the regulatory level, Bhutan’s Gelephu Mindfulness City has announced the inclusion of BNB in its official strategic reserves , alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum, becoming one of the first jurisdictions to formally recognize the token in its government portfolios. The trend extends beyond BNB, with GameSquare announcing $100 million Ethereum treasury allocation . GameSquare’s Ethereum strategy aims for yields of 8-14% through Dialectic’s Medici platform, which is significantly higher than the standard ETH staking returns of 3-4%. The media and entertainment firm raised $8 million in public offerings to fund the ETH treasury allocation. Similarly, Bit Digital completed its transformation by selling 280 BTC and deploying $172 million to accumulate over 100,000 ETH , positioning it among the largest public Ethereum holders globally. Bit Digital goes all-in on Ethereum, dumping all 280 $BTC to build massive 100K+ $ETH treasury after $172M capital raise targeting preeminent $ETH holding company status. #Bitcoin #Ethereum https://t.co/nBtaOQcNwt — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 8, 2025 The company operates 21,568 ETH in native staking protocols, earning 211 ETH in rewards during the first quarter of 2025. Binance Ecosystem Expansion Drives Institutional Adoption Binance unveiled Institutional Loans, offering verified corporate clients up to 4x leverage by borrowing against multiple accounts without requiring asset consolidation. The cross-collateralized credit line supports over 400 collateral assets, with major tokens like BTC, ETH, and BNB exempt from haircut ratios. The exchange continues demonstrating appeal to large market participants, with average Bitcoin deposits spiking to 7 BTC during price peaks, the highest among all exchanges. Binance also leads altcoin deposit activity, with up to 59,000 daily deposits, more than double the volume of Coinbase. Just yesterday, Kraken partnered with BNB Chain to expand the reach of xStocks , tokenizing U.S. equities and deploying BEP-20 tokens for assets such as Apple, Tesla, and Nvidia. BNB Chain’s Maxwell upgrade reduced block times from 1.5 seconds to 0.75 seconds, achieving sub-second finality while maintaining an average transaction fee of $0.04.

2025-07-10T09:01:52,"Bitcoin (BTC) Hits All-Time High Above $112,000: Is the Next Explosive Rally Here?","The Bitcoin (BTC) surge over $112,000 finally arrived as was expected. It was just a matter of time. Since then, the $BTC price has been consolidating into what looks like a continuation pattern. Is a more explosive move about to take place? $BTC makes new high It wasn’t until 18:00 GMT on Wednesday, but once the powerful move began there was no stopping it. Around 2.68%, and nearly $3,000 later, the bulls managed to push the price just above the last all-time high. A new high has been made, so what next for the king of the cryptocurrencies? Pennant forms on hourly time frame Source: TradingView After breaking out of the small descending trendline, the $BTC price arrowed upward and the bulls were just able to set a new all-time high. As can be seen by zooming into the very short time frame of the 1-hour chart, the price has been consolidating just below the high and looks to have formed a pennant. The price has recently broken out of this to the upside, and it just remains to be seen if the breakout will be confirmed. If it is, the measured move for the pennant is to around $114,000. $BTC heading higher after testing breakout? Source: TradingView A short time later, moving out slightly into the 4-hour chart, but still very much in the short-term time frame, it can be seen that the price retraced below the 0.236, which is the shallowest of the Fibonacci levels, but since then the price has been bouncing from this level. The retest after the breakout has taken place, and it seems that the bulls are trying to drag the price higher. The main issue will be that short to medium time frame indicators are now showing as overbought, but that said, the price could probably still keep rising for a while given the momentum behind this surge. Can $BTC climb above $130,000 next? Source: TradingView On the weekly time frame, the breakout is looking strong. The measured move for the bull flag would put the price well above $130,000. At the very bottom of the chart, the MACD is showing good separation of the two indicator lines and both are continuing to be angled upward. At the same time, the green histogram bars are gradually getting bigger. Moving up to the Stochastic RSI, the indicator lines are heading back to the top once more. If price keeps climbing, these indicator lines can continue to bounce along the top of the 80.00 level, signalling constant upside price momentum.

2025-07-10T09:00:15,"Altcoin Season Index: Decoding the Crypto Market’s Dominant Shift","Are you wondering where the crypto market is headed next? For seasoned investors and curious newcomers alike, understanding the prevailing market sentiment is crucial. The latest reading from the Altcoin Season Index, a pivotal metric, offers a clear signal: we are currently navigating a period known as Bitcoin Season. As of 00:28 UTC on July 10, the Altcoin Season Index, a widely tracked metric by CoinMarketCap (CMC), registered a value of 27. This figure, an increase of five points from the previous day’s report, strongly indicates that the market is currently experiencing what is commonly referred to as Bitcoin Season . But what exactly does this mean for your portfolio, and how can you leverage this information? What is the Altcoin Season Index and Why Does it Matter? The Altcoin Season Index is more than just a number; it’s a compass for understanding the broader cryptocurrency landscape. Developed by CoinMarketCap, one of the most reputable cryptocurrency price data platforms, this index provides a snapshot of market performance over a specific period. It helps investors gauge whether Bitcoin or the collective altcoins are leading the charge. Here’s how it works: Scope: The index rigorously tracks the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization on CoinMarketCap. It specifically excludes stablecoins (like USDT or USDC) and wrapped tokens (like wBTC) to ensure a clear focus on the volatile and growth-oriented segments of the market. Timeframe: Its calculation is based on the performance of these selected coins over the past 90 days. This three-month window provides a reasonable balance between short-term trends and longer-term shifts, preventing daily fluctuations from skewing the overall picture too much. The Core Rule: For the market to be officially in ‘Altcoin Season’, at least 75% of these top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the specified 90-day period. Conversely, if 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outshine Bitcoin, the market is deemed to be in ‘Bitcoin Season’. The index itself ranges from 1 (strong Bitcoin Season) to 100 (strong Altcoin Season). Understanding this index is vital because it offers a macro-level perspective that individual coin analysis might miss. It signals whether the market’s capital is flowing primarily into Bitcoin or diversifying into a broader range of digital assets , which has profound implications for investment strategies. Navigating Bitcoin Season: Understanding Current Market Dynamics When the Altcoin Season Index sits at a low number like 27, it unequivocally signals that we are in a period dominated by Bitcoin. During Bitcoin Season , the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization tends to outperform the vast majority of altcoins. This doesn’t mean altcoins can’t see gains, but their performance is generally subdued compared to Bitcoin, and many might even lose value against BTC. Several factors contribute to Bitcoin’s dominance during these periods: Safe Haven Narrative: In times of market uncertainty or broader economic instability, Bitcoin often acts as a perceived ‘safe haven’ within the crypto space. Investors might de-risk from more volatile altcoins and consolidate their holdings into BTC. Institutional Inflows: Large institutional investors often start their crypto journey with Bitcoin due to its liquidity, established infrastructure, and regulatory clarity (in some jurisdictions). Significant institutional buying can push Bitcoin’s price up without necessarily spilling over into altcoins immediately. Halving Cycle Influence: Bitcoin’s quadrennial halving events often precede bull runs. In the early stages of such cycles, Bitcoin typically leads the charge, absorbing liquidity before altcoins begin their parabolic moves. Market Leadership: Bitcoin remains the bellwether of the crypto market. Its price movements often dictate the overall sentiment, and during Bitcoin Season, it consolidates its leadership, pulling capital towards itself. For investors, Bitcoin Season calls for a strategic approach. It might be a time to accumulate Bitcoin, potentially rotate profits from underperforming altcoins into BTC, or be highly selective with altcoin investments, focusing only on those with strong fundamentals and clear catalysts. Risk management becomes paramount, as weaker altcoins can experience significant drawdowns against Bitcoin. The Allure of Altcoin Season: What Triggers the Shift? While we are currently in Bitcoin Season, the dream of Altcoin Season remains a powerful draw for many investors. This is the period where smaller, more volatile cryptocurrencies can experience explosive growth, often outperforming Bitcoin by significant margins. It’s when millionaires are made, and new narratives emerge. What typically triggers a shift from Bitcoin dominance to an altcoin rally? Bitcoin Dominance Peak: Often, an Altcoin Season begins after Bitcoin has had a substantial run and its dominance (its market cap percentage of the total crypto market) reaches a local peak. Investors who profited from Bitcoin then look to diversify and seek higher returns in altcoins. New Narratives and Technological Breakthroughs: The crypto space is constantly innovating. New sectors like DeFi, NFTs, GameFi, Layer 2 solutions, or specific blockchain ecosystems (e.g., Solana, Avalanche, Polkadot) can gain traction, attracting significant capital and driving the prices of their native tokens. Retail Investor Influx: Altcoin Season is often fueled by a surge in retail investor interest. As Bitcoin’s price climbs and captures mainstream attention, new money flows into the market, and these new participants often gravitate towards cheaper altcoins with the potential for higher percentage gains. Capital Rotation: This is a key concept. As Bitcoin’s rally matures, smart money often rotates out of Bitcoin and into large-cap altcoins, then mid-cap altcoins, and finally small-cap altcoins, creating successive waves of rallies. Macroeconomic Conditions: A ‘risk-on’ environment in traditional finance, characterized by low interest rates and high liquidity, can also spill over into the crypto market, encouraging speculation in higher-risk, higher-reward digital assets like altcoins. Recognizing the signs of an impending Altcoin Season – such as Bitcoin’s price stabilizing after a strong run, increasing trading volume in altcoins, and a general shift in sentiment – can be incredibly profitable. However, it also comes with increased risk due to the higher volatility of altcoins. Strategic Moves for Your Digital Assets Portfolio Understanding whether we’re in Altcoin Season or Bitcoin Season is not just academic; it’s foundational to effective portfolio management. Your strategy should adapt to the prevailing market winds. Here are some actionable insights: During Bitcoin Season (like now): Accumulate Bitcoin: Consider dollar-cost averaging into Bitcoin. Its relative stability and consistent leadership make it a strong foundational asset. Selective Altcoin Bets: If you must hold altcoins, focus on those with strong fundamentals, active development, clear use cases, and robust communities. Avoid highly speculative, unproven projects. Risk Management: Reduce exposure to highly volatile altcoins. Consider setting stop-losses or taking profits on altcoins that have already run up. Research Deeply: Use this quieter period to research potential altcoin gems for the next Altcoin Season. Understand their technology, tokenomics, and team. Preparing for Altcoin Season: Diversify Wisely: Once the signs of an impending Altcoin Season appear, gradually diversify your portfolio beyond Bitcoin into a curated selection of promising altcoins. Don’t just chase pumps. Tiered Approach: Start with established large-cap altcoins (e.g., Ethereum, Solana, Cardano), then move to mid-caps, and finally, cautiously, to small-caps with high growth potential. Profit Taking: Have a plan for taking profits. Altcoin Season can be exhilarating, but it’s also prone to sharp corrections. Don’t be afraid to sell a portion of your holdings as they reach your target prices. Stay Informed: Follow market news, project updates, and on-chain analytics closely. Narratives shift quickly in crypto. Remember, the goal is not to perfectly time the market but to align your strategy with its dominant trend. A well-diversified portfolio, coupled with a keen eye on the Altcoin Season Index and other indicators, can significantly improve your chances of success. Beyond the Index: Other Indicators to Watch in the Crypto Market While the Altcoin Season Index is an excellent tool, it’s just one piece of the puzzle. A holistic understanding of the crypto market requires looking at several other key indicators: Bitcoin Dominance Chart: This chart shows Bitcoin’s market capitalization as a percentage of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. A rising dominance suggests Bitcoin Season, while a falling dominance often precedes or accompanies Altcoin Season. Total Crypto Market Cap (Excluding BTC): Tracking the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies excluding Bitcoin can give you a clearer picture of altcoin health and growth. On-Chain Metrics: Indicators like active addresses, transaction volume, exchange inflows/outflows, and miner behavior can provide insights into network usage and investor sentiment. Macroeconomic Factors: The broader economic landscape (inflation rates, interest rate decisions by central banks, geopolitical events) can significantly influence investor appetite for risky assets like cryptocurrencies. Fear & Greed Index: This index measures current market sentiment. Extreme fear can signal buying opportunities, while extreme greed might suggest caution. News and Narratives: Keep an eye on major news events, technological breakthroughs, regulatory developments, and emerging narratives (e.g., AI in crypto, Real World Assets – RWAs) that can drive specific sectors or coins. Challenges and Considerations: Backward-Looking: The Altcoin Season Index is based on past performance (90 days), meaning it tells you what has happened, not what will happen next. It’s a guide, not a crystal ball. Volatility: The crypto market is inherently volatile. Even during a defined season, unexpected events can cause significant price swings. Individual Project Risk: Not all altcoins will perform well during Altcoin Season. Many will fail. Thorough due diligence on individual digital assets is crucial. Market Manipulation: Smaller altcoins can be more susceptible to pump-and-dump schemes. Conclusion: Navigating the Seasons of the Crypto Market The Altcoin Season Index provides a valuable lens through which to view the ever-evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Its current reading of 27 clearly signals that we are in a period where Bitcoin is leading the charge, influencing the performance of other digital assets . While the allure of massive gains during Altcoin Season is strong, understanding and adapting to the current Bitcoin-dominated environment is key to protecting and growing your portfolio. By combining the insights from the Altcoin Season Index with other crucial market indicators, diligent research, and a disciplined approach to risk management, investors can navigate the exciting, yet challenging, seasons of the crypto market more effectively. Whether it’s a time for Bitcoin accumulation or altcoin exploration, staying informed and strategic is your best asset.

2025-07-10T08:54:27,"XRP prepares for rally as RLUSD’s market cap hits $500M; check forecast","The cryptocurrency market extended its rally on Wednesday, with Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies in the green. Bitcoin set a new all-time high of $112k roughly two months after hitting $111k for the first time in its history. XRP is one of the best performers in the top 10, as it is up 4% over the last 24 hours. Traders are anticipating a further price surge for XRP amid growing institutional demand. RLUSD’s market cap surpasses $500M XRP, Ripple’s native coin, is up 4.4% in the last 24 hours and now trades above $2.4 for the first time since May 22. The rally comes amid an improved sentiment in the broader crypto market. Another major catalyst behind XRP’s rally is the surge in RLUSD’s market cap. RLUSD is Ripple’s stablecoin, and it has now surpassed a market cap of $500 million. This means that RLUSD has become one of the top 20 stablecoins in the world by market cap, roughly seven months after its launch. In addition to that, Thumzup Media has expanded its bitcoin-focused treasury strategy to include XRP, SOL, DOGE, ETH, and other tokens. The company also disclosed that Donald Trump Jr. owns 350,000 shares, worth about $4 million at current prices. Analysts now expect XRP to rally higher in the near to medium term. While speaking to CoinDesk, Arthur Azizov, founder of B2 Ventures, said XRP is likely to move towards a new local high around $2.65 if the current rally continues. “Since XRP has been in accumulation for quite a long time, the outlook remains positive,” he added, suggesting a rally towards $4-$6. XRP eyes $3 as technical indicators switch bullish The XRP/USD 4-hour chart has turned bullish after the coin topped the $2.4 mark. The technical indicators suggest XRP could be ready for a rally above the $3 mark. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 73 shows that XRP could be heading into an overbought region soon. In addition to that, the MACD lines are deep within the positive territory, suggesting a strong bullish bias. XRP currently has a flag with multiple bullish formations, including a symmetrical triangle and bull flag, supporting the case for a rally towards the $2.60–$2.65 resistance level. If broken, those levels could act as a springboard to hit the $3 mark for the first time since February. In the event of an extended rally, XRP could hit the TLQ level at $3.2 before encountering massive short positions. The medium to long-term prediction for XRP remains between $4 and $6 as traders predict a new all-time high over the next few months. In the event of a correction, XRP could retest the ILQ at $2.379 in the coming hours before surging higher. A break below this level could see XRP retest the $2.2 resistance.

Here Are the Details","Bitcoin's price reached a new all-time high of $112,014, according to analysts at crypto data analysis firm CryptoQuant. Bitcoin Reaches All-Time High at $112,014: Premium Over Coinbase Shows US Demand With this rise, the Bitcoin price gap between Coinbase and Binance has also widened noticeably: the price on Coinbase is $42 higher than on Binance. This price difference, the Coinbase premium, is considered a strong indicator of strong demand from US-based investors. Analysts note that such positive premiums typically signal growing interest in Bitcoin from institutional or individual investors. However, this week's $42 difference isn't the highest it's been in recent days. Last week, Coinbase's premium climbed to $87.76, indicating a period of much more intense buying pressure in the market. Analysts made the following statements: The Coinbase premium is a key indicator of US investor demand. Despite prices reaching all-time highs, the positive premium suggests that buying interest in the market remains strong. This suggests the upward trend may not be over yet. While the Bitcoin market continues its path with new highs, the orientation of institutional investors, especially in the US, continues to play a determining role in pricing. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-10T08:46:12,"Chinese creditors challenge FTX’s bid to block billions in payouts","The bankrupt exchange’s latest proposal to waive creditor settlements in certain regions has drawn legal resistance from a group of Chinese users. On July 8, 2025, FTX creditor Weiwei Ji filed an objection in the Delaware Bankruptcy Court, representing 300 others in opposition to the exchange. Central to the filing is the rejection of the bankruptcy estate’s proposal to restrict payouts to users in 49 jurisdictions, where crypto is banned or unclear under local law. China , which accounts for more than 80% of the affected claim value, is one of the key regions under review, alongside countries like Russia, Morocco, North Korea, and others. If officially designated, creditors in these regions could be excluded from the ongoing distribution process . You might also like: Why FTX creditors in 49 countries may be cut from payouts Ji, a Chinese passport holder and tax resident of Singapore, argued that the inclusion of China in the list is both factually wrong and legally unsupported, arguing that distributing funds to users in the region carries no regulatory or criminal implications. “The FTX Recovery Trust’s attempt to withhold distributions from Chinese creditors based on jurisdictional interpretations of crypto regulation is both unreasonable and legally unfounded,” Ji wrote. “There is no credible legal basis to conclude that distributions to Chinese creditors would subject the Trust, or any distribution agent, to regulatory or criminal risk.” He noted that FTX claims are denominated and settled in U.S. dollars, not crypto, and can be lawfully received by Chinese residents through standard channels, including wire transfers via Hong Kong -based accounts. To strengthen his case, Ji emphasized the legal status of crypto in China. Crypto holdings, not trading, are ‘lawful’ under Chinese laws While retail trading may be restricted, Ji argued that crypto ownership remains legal in the country, with courts recognizing assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) as personal property. This view has been supported by past rulings, including a 2024 ruling by a Shanghai Court that affirmed the protection of digital assets under civil law. He also pointed out that Hong Kong, which maintains a more favorable stance on crypto , operates under a separate legal framework and actively supports regulated digital asset activity. Read more: Is crypto banned in China? Full history of China crypto bans Supporting his case, Ji cited legal precedent, including the Celsius bankruptcy, where Chinese users were paid in USD, and the Mt. Gox rehabilitation, where Chinese creditors successfully received crypto payouts through Kraken, emphasizing that neither case imposed restrictions based on jurisdiction. FTX’s motion remains under review ahead of a court hearing scheduled for July 22, and Ji is urging the court to reject any designation that would exclude Chinese creditors from receiving their share under the bankruptcy plan.
