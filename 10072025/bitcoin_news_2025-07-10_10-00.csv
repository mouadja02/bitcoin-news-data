2025-07-10T07:50:51,"Ethereum ETF Faces Crucial SEC Delay: What It Means for BlackRock’s Spot Plan","Are you closely watching the unfolding drama in the world of cryptocurrency regulation? If so, you’re not alone. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has once again captured headlines, this time with a pivotal decision regarding BlackRock’s ambitious proposal for a spot Ethereum ETF . This isn’t just another regulatory hiccup; it’s a moment that could significantly shape the future of institutional investment in digital assets. The financial world held its breath as news broke: the SEC has officially delayed its decision on BlackRock’s application to allow in-kind creations and redemptions for its proposed spot Ethereum ETF (ETHA). This move, while not entirely unexpected given the SEC’s cautious stance on cryptocurrencies, introduces a fresh wave of uncertainty into a market eagerly awaiting clearer regulatory pathways. But what exactly does this delay signify, and why is the ‘in-kind’ mechanism so important? What Exactly is an Ethereum ETF , and Why Does “In-Kind” Matter So Much? Before diving deeper into the implications of the SEC’s latest move, let’s clarify what an Ethereum ETF is and why the specific ‘in-kind’ mechanism is a focal point of discussion. An Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is a type of investment fund that trades on stock exchanges, much like a stock. A crypto ETF, like the proposed Ethereum ETF, would allow investors to gain exposure to the price movements of Ethereum without directly owning the cryptocurrency itself. This offers a regulated, accessible, and often more secure way for traditional investors to participate in the crypto market. Now, let’s talk about the ‘in-kind’ creation and redemption mechanism, which is at the heart of BlackRock’s proposal and the SEC’s current deliberation. This mechanism contrasts sharply with ‘cash’ creation and redemption: In-Kind Creation: Authorized Participants (APs) – typically large financial institutions – would deliver actual Ethereum to the ETF issuer in exchange for new ETF shares. This means they are trading the underlying asset directly for fund shares. In-Kind Redemption: Conversely, when APs want to redeem ETF shares, they would receive actual Ethereum from the fund’s reserves. Why is this important? The ‘in-kind’ model is generally preferred by ETF issuers and institutional investors because it can offer several benefits: Tax Efficiency: In-kind transfers typically do not trigger taxable events for the fund, potentially leading to better long-term performance for investors. Lower Costs: It can reduce transaction costs and operational complexities compared to cash models, as the fund doesn’t need to buy or sell the underlying asset with fiat currency. Reduced Market Impact: Direct transfers of crypto assets can potentially minimize market impact compared to large cash trades, especially in volatile markets. Conversely, a ‘cash’ creation/redemption model would involve APs exchanging cash for ETF shares, and vice-versa, with the ETF issuer then buying or selling the underlying Ethereum on the open market. The SEC has historically preferred cash-creation models for crypto ETFs, citing concerns about market manipulation and investor protection, as it keeps the fund’s direct interaction with the crypto markets limited. The SEC Delay : A Familiar Roadblock or a New Hurdle? The news of the SEC delay on BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF isn’t an isolated incident; it’s part of a broader pattern of regulatory caution concerning cryptocurrency products. For years, the SEC has been hesitant to approve spot crypto ETFs, citing concerns ranging from market manipulation and liquidity issues to investor protection and the nascent nature of the digital asset market. Let’s look at the historical context: Product Type SEC Stance (Historically) Current Status (General) Bitcoin Futures ETF Approved relatively early (e.g., ProShares BITO in 2021) due to regulation of underlying futures market. Several approved and trading. Spot Bitcoin ETF Repeatedly rejected for years, citing market manipulation concerns and lack of surveillance sharing agreements. Approved in January 2024 after court rulings and significant pressure. Spot Ethereum ETF Under review; similar concerns as Bitcoin, plus debate over ETH’s classification (security vs. commodity). Currently facing delays, no approvals yet. The recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 set a precedent, largely due to a court mandate that the SEC re-evaluate its stance. Many in the industry hoped this would pave the way for a smoother approval process for Ethereum ETFs. However, the SEC’s current delay suggests they are taking a deliberate, cautious approach, possibly waiting for more clarity on Ethereum’s regulatory classification. Is Ethereum a commodity, like Bitcoin, or a security? This fundamental question continues to loom large over any ETF application. Furthermore, the SEC’s concerns often revolve around the underlying spot market’s susceptibility to manipulation, the adequacy of surveillance-sharing agreements with exchanges, and ensuring robust investor protection. While the crypto market has matured significantly, these concerns remain a primary hurdle for new product approvals. What Does This Mean for BlackRock Ethereum ‘s Ambitions? When a financial titan like BlackRock, with trillions of dollars under management, enters the crypto ETF arena, it sends ripples across both traditional finance and the digital asset space. BlackRock’s entry into the Bitcoin spot ETF market was a game-changer, lending immense credibility and institutional weight to the asset class. Their subsequent application for a spot BlackRock Ethereum ETF signaled a strong belief in Ethereum’s long-term potential and its role in the evolving digital economy. For BlackRock, this delay is likely a strategic pause rather than a complete roadblock. They are known for their meticulous approach and deep understanding of regulatory landscapes. While the delay means their proposed ETHA product won’t launch as quickly as some hoped, BlackRock has the resources and expertise to navigate complex regulatory environments. Their persistence in pursuing both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs underscores their conviction that digital assets will become a significant part of mainstream investment portfolios. The impact on BlackRock’s immediate strategy might involve: Continued Engagement: BlackRock will likely continue discussions and provide additional information to the SEC to address any outstanding concerns. Patience and Adaptation: They are prepared for a lengthy process, having seen the protracted battle for Bitcoin spot ETF approvals. Market Signal: Despite the delay, BlackRock’s continued pursuit of an Ethereum ETF sends a powerful signal to other institutional players that Ethereum is a serious contender for broad investment adoption. This delay doesn’t diminish BlackRock’s long-term vision; instead, it highlights the inherent challenges of introducing innovative financial products into a highly regulated space. Understanding the Implications for the Spot Ethereum ETF Market The SEC’s decision to delay BlackRock’s application has broader implications for the entire Spot Ethereum ETF market. Several other prominent asset managers, including Fidelity, Grayscale, VanEck, and ARK 21Shares, also have spot Ethereum ETF applications pending with the SEC. The fate of BlackRock’s application often sets a precedent or indicates the SEC’s general sentiment towards similar proposals. Here’s how this delay impacts the wider spot Ethereum ETF landscape: Industry-Wide Uncertainty: The delay creates a cloud of uncertainty for all applicants. If BlackRock, with its vast resources and influence, faces a delay, it suggests that other applications will likely encounter similar scrutiny and timelines. Extended Timelines: Investors and issuers should now anticipate a longer wait for any spot Ethereum ETF approvals. Initial hopes for approvals by mid-2024 might be pushed further into the year or even into 2025. Market Reaction: While the market reaction to this specific delay has been relatively subdued compared to past regulatory news, prolonged uncertainty could temper investor enthusiasm for Ethereum in the short term. However, the long-term bullish case for institutional adoption remains intact. Focus on Regulatory Clarity: The delay underscores the critical need for clearer regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. Without definitive guidance on how digital assets are classified and regulated, the approval process for new financial products will remain arduous. Ultimately, the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF is seen as a significant catalyst for mainstream adoption, potentially unlocking billions in institutional capital. Each delay, while frustrating, is a step in a complex dance between innovation and regulation. Navigating the Waters: Challenges and Opportunities of In-Kind Redemption The core of BlackRock’s proposal, and a key point of contention for the SEC, revolves around the in-kind redemption mechanism. While beneficial for tax efficiency and operational costs, it also presents unique challenges in the context of cryptocurrency regulation. Challenges of In-Kind Redemption: Custody and Security: Managing direct custody of large amounts of Ethereum for an ETF requires extremely robust security protocols. The SEC needs assurance that these digital assets are protected from hacks, theft, and loss. Valuation and Pricing: Ensuring accurate and fair valuation of Ethereum during in-kind creations and redemptions, especially given crypto market volatility, can be complex. Regulatory Oversight: The SEC’s primary concern is investor protection. They need to be confident that the in-kind mechanism doesn’t expose investors to undue risks, particularly concerning market manipulation or illicit activities on the underlying crypto exchanges. Compliance: Ensuring that all aspects of the in-kind process comply with existing securities laws and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations is a monumental task for both the issuer and the regulator. Opportunities Presented by In-Kind Redemption: Enhanced Market Efficiency: By allowing direct transfers of ETH, the in-kind model can facilitate more efficient arbitrage, helping to keep the ETF’s price closely aligned with its Net Asset Value (NAV). Broader Institutional Access: For institutions that are comfortable with direct crypto exposure but prefer the ETF wrapper for regulatory or operational reasons, the in-kind model offers a more direct link to the underlying asset. Tax Advantages for Investors: As mentioned, the tax efficiency of in-kind transfers can translate into better after-tax returns for investors, making the product more attractive. Legitimization of Crypto: An in-kind spot Ethereum ETF would represent a significant milestone in the legitimization of Ethereum as a mainstream asset class, paving the way for more sophisticated financial products. The SEC’s delay likely stems from a need to thoroughly vet these challenges and ensure that BlackRock’s proposed solutions meet their stringent requirements for investor protection and market integrity. The dialogue between the regulator and the applicant will be crucial in addressing these concerns. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Ethereum ETFs? The immediate future for spot Ethereum ETFs, including BlackRock’s ETHA, now involves a waiting game. The SEC typically has several deadlines for these applications, allowing for extensions and public comment periods. While a delay can be frustrating, it’s a standard part of the regulatory review process, especially for novel financial products. Key factors that could influence the eventual decision include: Clarity on Ethereum’s Classification: A definitive statement from the SEC or other U.S. regulators on whether Ethereum is classified as a commodity or a security would significantly impact the approval process. Political and Legal Pressure: Similar to the Bitcoin spot ETFs, potential political pressure or further legal challenges could influence the SEC’s timeline and ultimate decision. Market Maturity: The continued growth and increasing sophistication of the Ethereum ecosystem and the broader crypto market might eventually ease some of the SEC’s concerns. Industry Dialogue: Ongoing engagement between ETF applicants, crypto exchanges, and the SEC to address surveillance sharing and market manipulation concerns will be vital. While an approval might not happen in the immediate future, the fact that major players like BlackRock are relentlessly pursuing these products indicates a strong belief in their eventual success. The trajectory points towards eventual approval, but the path is undoubtedly winding. Actionable Insights for Investors For investors keenly following the development of Ethereum ETFs, the SEC’s delay offers a moment for reflection and strategic planning: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on official SEC announcements and reputable financial news sources. Regulatory updates can significantly impact market sentiment. Long-Term Perspective: Institutional adoption of crypto is a long game. While short-term delays can cause fluctuations, the underlying trend of traditional finance embracing digital assets remains strong. Diversify: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. The crypto market is inherently volatile. A diversified portfolio, considering both direct crypto holdings and traditional investments, is often a wise approach. Understand the Risks: Even with an ETF, investing in cryptocurrencies carries risks. Do your own research (DYOR) and understand the technology, market dynamics, and regulatory landscape. Consider Alternatives (for now): If you’re eager for Ethereum exposure through a regulated product, consider existing Ethereum futures ETFs or regulated crypto trusts (if available in your jurisdiction) while awaiting spot ETF approvals. Conclusion: A Steely Resolve in the Face of Regulatory Winds The SEC’s decision to delay BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF application, particularly concerning its in-kind creation and redemption mechanism, is a significant moment in the ongoing saga of crypto regulation. It underscores the U.S. regulator’s cautious, deliberate approach to integrating digital assets into mainstream financial products. While frustrating for those eager for immediate institutional adoption, this delay is a testament to the rigorous scrutiny required for products of this magnitude. BlackRock’s unwavering pursuit, alongside other major asset managers, signals a profound long-term commitment to Ethereum and the broader crypto market. The challenges of regulatory clarity, market integrity, and investor protection are formidable, but the opportunities for unlocking vast institutional capital and legitimizing digital assets are equally immense. As the financial world watches, the dialogue between innovation and regulation continues, promising an eventual, albeit protracted, integration of cryptocurrencies into the global investment landscape. The path to a fully regulated and widely accessible spot Ethereum ETF may be longer than anticipated, but the journey continues with unwavering institutional resolve.

Here Are the Details","US-traded spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) reached a historic milestone on Wednesday, surpassing $50 billion in total net inflows. This achievement is being considered a critical step in Bitcoin's institutionalization process. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Surpass $50 Billion Net Inflow Threshold on Surge of Institutional Demand According to data provider SoSoValue, 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a total of $218 million in net inflows on Wednesday, bringing the total net inflow to $50.16 billion. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen strong momentum in April, May and June, with billions of dollars in uninterrupted capital inflows. BlackRock's IBIT product saw the most inflows of the day, with $125.5 million. Ark & 21Shares' ARKB fund saw net inflows of $56.96 million, while Grayscale's Mini Bitcoin Trust saw net inflows of $15.8 million. Other major providers such as Fidelity, Bitwise, Valkyrie, and Invesco also reported positive inflows. BTC Markets analyst Rachael Lucas commented on this milestone with these words: “Spot Bitcoin ETFs surpassing $50 billion is a defining moment in the institutionalization of Bitcoin. This is not a retail investor frenzy; this is a steady flow of capital from asset managers, corporate treasuries, and wealth management platforms.” According to Lucas, demand for Bitcoin is rising due to both geopolitical tensions and former President Donald Trump's promises of aggressive interest rate cuts. Bitcoin's stable supply and global liquidity make it a prominent asset during this period. However, the real disruptor is the ETF format. “These ETF products are regulated and transparent, making them easily accessible to investors through stock and bond infrastructures. They make participation easy.” On the same day, Bitcoin broke new all-time highs, reaching $112,152. The leading cryptocurrency, which was trading at $110,990 at press time, has gained 2% in the last 24 hours. Spot Ethereum ETFs are also continuing their upward trend.

According to data from Lookonchain, wallet address 0xCB92 opened a 50,000 ETH short position on Hyperliquid, which at one point showed an unrealized profit of over $26 million. But rather than closing the transaction, the trader held on — even adding another 10,000 ETH to the short position even as the price rose. A short position is, in effect, a bet the price will fall . If it rises, the trader loses out. The decision turned out to be costly. As ETH surged, the position was stopped out, and Lookonchain reported the trader realized a loss of $716,000 as of Thursday. The position might have been a hedge against a long position as part of a broader strategy, though the tracked wallet held only a short position. The moves are reminiscent of infamous trader ‘James Wynn,’ whose on-chain antics drew eyes to Hyperliquid among mainstream circles. In May, Wynn built a record-setting $1.25 billion notional long position in bitcoin (BTC) at an average price of $108,243, only to see it collapse as the fell below $105,000 after U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff announcement on EU exports . Multiple liquidations, including a 527 BTC position worth over $55 million and a 421 BTC position worth nearly $44 million, wiped out more than $100 million of Wynn’s holdings over a few days, leaving many wondering if they were witnessing a full-blown gambling addiction.

2025-07-10T07:20:36,"AI Agents: The Transformative Force Unlocking the Future of Enterprise Software","Just as decentralized finance reshaped traditional banking and Bitcoin introduced a new paradigm for digital value, a new wave of AI innovation is poised to redefine enterprise software. The familiar reign of Software as a Service (SaaS) is being challenged, with a bold vision emerging where AI agents become the central operating force, fundamentally altering how businesses and individuals interact with technology. The Revolutionary Shift to AI Agents Dave Park, co-founder and CEO of Narada AI, states, “SaaS is going away.” This isn’t just a provocative statement; it’s a declaration of a fundamental shift in how we conceive and utilize digital tools. Park, speaking on Bitcoin World’s flagship podcast, Equity, envisions a future where the traditional reliance on numerous SaaS applications becomes obsolete. He highlights a critical inefficiency: “The typical knowledge worker today deals with anywhere from 17 to 25 different SaaS tools and portals every day, wasting two and a half hours just manually looking up or updating these systems.” The solution, according to Park, lies in a simplified ecosystem: “We believe in a future where it’ll just be the data, the databases, and AI agents or agentic models that take your request and operate across those silos to get the job done.” This isn’t merely an incremental upgrade; it’s a complete re-imagining of the digital workspace, driven by intelligent automation that understands intent and executes complex tasks autonomously. Understanding Agentic AI: Beyond Traditional Automation What exactly is agentic AI , and how does it differ from the automation we’ve grown accustomed to? Traditional automation typically involves scripting predefined rules or workflows. If a condition is met, a specific action is triggered. Agentic AI, however, goes much further. It involves intelligent software entities that can reason, plan, and execute multi-step tasks across various systems, even when explicit APIs or integrations are missing. They learn and adapt, much like a human assistant would. Narada AI, emerging from UC Berkeley research, has developed what they call “large action models” (LAMs). These are a powerful evolution of large language models (LLMs), designed not just to understand and generate text, but to reason through and complete complex, multi-step tasks across different work tools. The key differentiator is their ability to operate effectively even when direct API connections aren’t available, navigating systems in a more human-like, adaptive manner. To better illustrate the distinction, consider the following comparison: Feature Traditional Automation Agentic AI (e.g., Narada AI) Task Execution Pre-defined, rule-based, rigid workflows. Reasoning, dynamic, adaptive to new situations and goals. Integration Relies heavily on robust APIs; breaks if APIs change. Operates across silos even with missing APIs; learns to navigate interfaces. Problem Solving Limited to known scenarios and explicit instructions. Handles novel, multi-step, complex problems; infers intent. Learning & Adaptation Minimal to none; requires manual updates or re-scripting. Continuously learns and improves from interactions and feedback. User Interaction Requires users to manage multiple interfaces and trigger workflows. Operates autonomously based on high-level requests; user provides goals. The End of SaaS as We Know It? The vision presented by Narada AI suggests a future where the concept of “using” individual apps might become outdated. Instead of opening a CRM, then an email client, then a project management tool, an AI agent could simply receive a high-level request – for example, “Follow up with all leads from last week’s conference who opened the introductory email but haven’t replied, and schedule a call.” The agent would then autonomously navigate across your CRM, email platform, and calendar, executing the necessary steps without direct human intervention across each application. This shift has profound implications for enterprise software . Companies might move away from licensing dozens of distinct SaaS products, instead focusing on robust data infrastructure that AI agents can access and orchestrate. The value proposition shifts from features within an app to the seamless flow of information and execution of tasks across an entire digital ecosystem. Narada AI’s Vision: Powering the Future of Productivity Narada AI is not just talking about this future; they are building it. Their debut at Bitcoin World Disrupt 2024 showcased their large action models, demonstrating a tangible path to overcoming the inefficiencies of current enterprise environments. By enabling agents to reason and act across disparate systems, even those lacking modern APIs, Narada AI directly addresses the “two and a half hours wasted” problem Park identified. While the initial focus might be on large enterprises, the benefits are expected to cascade. Park believes that tools like Narada could eventually empower solopreneurs and smaller teams, leveling the playing field by providing sophisticated automation capabilities previously exclusive to large organizations with dedicated IT departments. Imagine a small business owner able to manage sales, marketing, and customer service with a single intelligent assistant, rather than juggling a dozen subscriptions. Navigating the Agentic AI Landscape: Challenges and Opportunities The timing for this conversation is crucial. Y Combinator’s most recent batch included over 70 agentic startups, signaling a strong belief in this emerging sector. Major players like Grammarly are also investing heavily, building comprehensive AI work stacks through strategic partnerships and acquisitions. This indicates a broad industry recognition of the potential of agentic AI . However, the transition won’t be without its challenges. There are common misunderstandings about automation and the hype surrounding AI. Enterprises need to prepare their data infrastructure, ensure data quality, and establish robust security protocols to safely deploy AI agents at scale. Trust and transparency will be paramount as these agents gain more autonomy. For businesses looking to embrace this future, key actionable insights include: Assess Your Data Landscape: Understand where your data resides and how accessible it is. Clean, well-organized data is the fuel for effective AI agents. Start Small, Think Big: Begin with pilot projects in specific, high-value areas to understand the impact and refine deployment strategies. Invest in AI Literacy: Educate your workforce on the capabilities and limitations of agentic AI, fostering a culture of collaboration with these new digital assistants. Prioritize Security and Governance: As agents gain access to sensitive information and critical systems, robust security frameworks and clear governance policies are essential. The move from SaaS to AI agents represents more than just a technological upgrade; it’s a philosophical shift in how we approach productivity and digital interaction. It promises a future where technology adapts to us, rather than us adapting to technology, freeing up valuable human time for creativity, strategy, and complex problem-solving that only humans can perform.

2025-07-10T07:12:37,"Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction for July 11","After climbing over 3% in the past 48 hours, Bitcoin price is testing the upper range of its recent consolidation near $111,300. However, as the price nears the upper Bollinger Band and horizontal resistance at $112,400, early signs of exhaustion are surfacing. The question now is whether Bitcoin price today can secure a breakout above this resistance or if bulls will step back and allow a short-term correction. What’s Happening With Bitcoin’s Price? BTC price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Bitcoin has surged out of a two-week ascending triangle, supported by a strong trendline from late June. The breakout above $110,000 was accompanied by a volume spike, pushing price into the $111,300–$111,600 region.

2025-07-10T07:04:30,"Best-Selling Author Ric Edelman Doubles Down on $500,000 Bitcoin (BTC) Price Target As ‘Smart’ Investors Pile In","Personal finance author and investor Ric Edelman is detailing a massively bullish Bitcoin ( BTC ) prediction. In a new interview with Natalie Brunell, Edelman says he believes BTC will increase more than 350% from its current value in less than five years as Bitcoin adoption accelerates and savvy investors buy the dip. “I don’t believe we’re ever going to see a 70% or 80% drawdown again. I wouldn’t say never to a 40% or even a 50% [dip], but there are now so many institutional investors and sovereign wealth funds and hedge funds and family offices … these are smart people, and when you see a significant drop of 20% or 30% they’re going to recognize the buying opportunity for what it is, and that will put a floor unlike we’ve ever seen before. So sure, we’re going to continue to see volatility, but as the asset class matures, that volatility gets less and less.” Edelman predicts more and more investors will add at least a small percentage of BTC to their overall investment portfolio, sending send Bitcoin to $500,000 by 2030. “I’m actually pretty conservative. A lot of other folks say $1 million by 2030. [Founder and executive chairman of software firm Strategy] Michael Saylor says $5 million. But not too many others share their math. I do pretty openly. I’ll tell you very quickly and easily how I get there. If you take a look at the world’s global assets, the total value of everything, the value of stocks, bonds, real estate, gold, oil, commodities, you name it, add up the total value of everything, it’s about $800 trillion. Now if you take the owners of all that stuff, you own a little bit of it, I own a little bit of it, we all own a little bit, if all the owners of all that stuff allocate just 1% of their portfolio to Bitcoin that would be a flow of $8 trillion. That would put Bitcoin at $500,000, simple as that.” Bitcoin is trading for $111,087 at time of writing, up 2% in the last 24 hours.

Bitwise CEO Wonders appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple is making headlines again. The company has officially teamed up with BNY Mellon, the world’s largest custodian bank, to safeguard the reserves for its stablecoin RLUSD. The stablecoin has already crossed $500 million in circulation, and this move marks a big milestone for Ripple’s growing payments and stablecoin business. The news didn’t go unnoticed. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley stirred conversation online, wondering aloud if Ripple might soon be seen as an “XRP treasury company.” His post got a mixed response and while some called it a big bet on Ripple’s future, others thought it felt a bit overhyped. I wonder if in 12 months, people will call Ripple an XRP treasury company. — Hunter Horsley (@HHorsley) July 10, 2025 In a recent interview with CNBC, Horsley spoke about why he thinks 2025 will be a major turning point for crypto. For years, uncertainty around crypto regulations in the U.S. has made investors hesitate. But according to Horsley, that’s finally changing. He said lawmakers, regulators, and even the White House are starting to take a more open, constructive approach toward digital assets. He compared the crypto market’s moment to when the iPhone first arrived, met with skepticism, but eventually became a standard tool in every workplace. Horsley said that the market will soon see Bitcoin, XRP, and other digital assets making their way into mainstream businesses and services, not just crypto exchanges. However, previously, Horsley had shared a different view about the U.S. crypto reserve plan announced by President Trump in March. While the reserve is expected to include top cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano along with Bitcoin, Horsley believed Bitcoin alone should have been the focus. In short, between Ripple’s new partnership and growing support from regulators, it feels like crypto might finally be heading toward the mainstream spotlight.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/is-ripple-turning-into-an-xrp-treasury-company-bitwise-ceo-wonders/,"XRP|REGULATION|BTC|FIAT|BUSINESS","News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

He added that the banks face an “unprecedented challenge,” in that they cannot print Bitcoin to defend their currency, which creates a “policy trilemma.” Policymakers essentially have three choices: they can raise interest rates to defend the currency through higher yields, deplete foreign currency reserves to support the domestic currency, or they can “join the migration,” and purchase Bitcoin themselves, “legitimizing the very trend they’re trying to counter,” according to Livingston. “This represents a fundamental shift in the balance of power between Bitcoin and governments. The free market is going to win.” Bitcoin has effectively cornered the world’s central banks and there is no way out. The banks face an unprecedented challenge: they cannot print Bitcoin to defend their currency. This creates a policy trilemma where authorities must choose between: Raise Interest Rates:… — Adam Livingston (@AdamBLiv) July 9, 2025 Devaluation of Fiat There are only a handful of countries that have adopted a national strategic Bitcoin reserve. El Salvador and Bhutan are the two official ones with 6,089 and 13,029 BTC held, respectively. While several others, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, China, and Ukraine, are unofficially holding the asset but have not declared national reserves. “The era of fiat optionality is quietly closing, and the game theory around sovereign adoption is heating up,” said crypto YouTuber ‘Professor Crypto.’ Renowned analysts and crypto entrepreneurs such as Anthony Pompliano, Willy Woo, and Arthur Hayes have all predicted that fiat devaluation through money printing will continue. “The main reason why Bitcoin was made is debasement, fiat money printing by central banks, resulting in hyperinflation,” said Woo in June. “All major governments are too far in debt; they will have to print and monetize to repay it,” stated Kalypsus Research on Thursday. “This is why investors are rotating to Bitcoin. It can’t be devalued by governments printing more money.” China Media Expect More Fiscal Stimulus: BBG The amount of global debt that will be issued in the next decade will double the current debt load, and central banks will be monetizing it all. — zerohedge (@zerohedge) July 10, 2025 Slow Adoption, CBDC Push However, central banks are not likely to rush into embracing Bitcoin just yet. The job of a central bank is to dictate monetary policy, price stability, and control the flow of funds within an economy, which includes its citizens. Bitcoin represents a significant threat to their control mechanisms because people can transact between themselves or through decentralized exchanges without banking and government oversight or control. The problem is when users want to cash out to fiat, and that is when the banks can regain authority by controlling exit ramps as the chokepoint for governments to exert influence. Many countries allow regulated crypto trading, which can be taxed , and often restrict crypto payments , which circumvent the banking system. Additionally, central banks also fear loss of control over the money supply, especially with stablecoins and crypto-dollarization. This is why many are pursuing CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies), Pakistan being the most recent, as highly controllable digital alternatives.

You might also like: Ex-SHIB and DOGE whales move entire bags into XYZVerse, eyeing 1000x gains Bitcoin shows consistent growth Source: TradingView Bitcoin ( BTC ) has been on an upward trend over the past six months, recording a 12.29% price increase. In the last month, it gained 4.33%, while the past week saw a modest rise of 0.5317%. This consistent growth reflects positive momentum in the market. Currently, Bitcoin is trading between $106,072 and $111,488, slightly above its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $109,104 and $108,716 respectively. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 52.17, indicating neutral market sentiment. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is at 165.20, which may hint at a potential bullish trend. If Bitcoin breaks through the nearest resistance level at $113,748, it could target the next resistance at $119,164, representing a potential gain of about 5%. Conversely, if the price falls below the immediate support at $102,915, it might drop to the second support level at $97,498, a decrease of approximately 5%. Given the current indicators, Bitcoin may continue its gradual ascent, but key levels should be watched closely. Ethereum maintains stability Source: TradingView Ethereum’s price ( ETH ) has seen modest gains recently. Over the past week, it increased by 3.07%, and over the past month, it’s up by 3.97%. However, over the last six months, the price is down by 23.71%. Currently, Ethereum is trading between $2,419.79 and $2,680.77, close to its 10-day simple moving average of $2,572.70. Technical indicators suggest a potential upward trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 61.06, indicating positive momentum but not overbought conditions. The MACD level is positive at 12.3961, showing bullish momentum. The nearest resistance level is at $2,789. If Ethereum breaks above thislevel, it could aim for the second resistance at $3,050, which would represent an increase of approximately 14% from current prices. On the downside, the nearest support is at $2,267.52, and if the price falls below this, it could drop to the second support at $2,006.54, a decrease of around 19%. Given the recent gains and positive technical signals, Ethereum may continue to rise in the short term. Breaking above the resistance levels could lead to significant percentage increases, potentially recovering some of the losses from the past six months. Traders will watch closely to see if Ethereum can sustain this upward momentum.

The company holds $2 million in Bitcoin, and plans to add six more cryptocurrencies as part of the Trump family’s crypto treasury strategy. Bloomberg reports that he bought them on his advisor’s recommendation and has no other role in the company. The news comes after a $6 million private stock deal led by Dominari Securities, where Trump Jr. and his brother Eric are advisors to the parent company. Thumzup Expands Crypto Strategy with Six New Digital Assets In a latest press release , the company announced that the board has officially approved a plan to expand the company’s crypto holdings. The company will start buying and holding more cryptocurrencies, specifically Dogecoin, Litecoin, Solana, XRP, Ethereum, and USDC, as part of its financial strategy. In November 2024, Thumzup’s board approved using Bitcoin as a treasury asset, allowing up to $1 million in BTC purchases. It also filed with the SEC to raise up to $200 million through debt and equity to boost its Bitcoin purchases. Stock Drops 14% Thumzup, which pays users to promote products on Instagram, reported just $151 in revenue and a $2.2 million loss in Q1 2025. The company started buying bitcoin in January. It now holds 19.106 BTC worth $2.1 million and allows up to 90% of its liquid assets in crypto. However, the company’s stock dropped over 14% on Wednesday as investors responded to its increased crypto exposure. Some analysts have raised concerns over the rise of companies holding Bitcoin as a treasury asset. They question whether this trend is sustainable or just a phase that could fade and trigger a major market downturn. Trump Family’s Crypto Trail Donald Trump Jr.’s move into Thumzup is the latest in the Trump family’s growing involvement in crypto. Back in March, Eric Trump had joined the advisory board of Metaplanet, a Japanese company shifting its reserves into Bitcoin. In a recent move, Trump Media & Technology Group has also filed to launch a new crypto ETF that will invest in several tokens, including Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, and Ripple. In June, Trump Media also filed with the SEC to launch the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF, a fund that directly holds Bitcoin and tracks its price. The company is also putting $2.5 billion into building its own Bitcoin treasury. Speaking at the 2025 Bitcoin Conference, Donald Trump Jr. said, “We’re serious about crypto and Bitcoin. We’re in three big deals and just getting started.

According to Bloomberg , Trump Jr. acquired 350,000 shares of the Los Angeles-based company, valued at over $4 million at the time of disclosure. Notably, the purchase was made following a recommendation from his investment adviser, and he has no active role within the company. The stake was revealed shortly after a $6 million private placement of convertible preferred stock, arranged by Dominari Securities, where both Donald Jr. and his brother Eric Trump serve as advisers to the parent company. Thumzup, which operates an app that pays users to promote products on platforms like Instagram, has posted minimal revenue alongside net losses. In the first quarter of 2025, the firm reported a $2.2 million loss on just $151 in revenue.

By January 2025, Thumzup doubled down on its strategy, increasing its holdings to 19.106 BTC, then valued at approximately $2 million, and authorizing up to 90% of its surplus cash for Bitcoin allocation. It has also paid some of its Associate Salesperson Program participants in Bitcoin as part of its adoption strategy. As previously reported by crypto.news, Thumzup recently amended its universal shelf registration filing with the SEC to be able to raise up to $500 million over the next three years. While the registration is not yet effective, the company has disclosed plans to allocate some of the proceeds to expand its Bitcoin treasury.

In a recent post shared on the Trump-backed social media’s official account, the platform indicated that it plans to launch a utility token “in the near future.” Based on the post, Trump Media is in the beta phase of testing its new Truth+ subscription plan called the Patriot Package. Users who subscribe to the Patriot Package will be able to accumulate rewards through their social media account that will be tied to the utility token. “Based on their level of engagement with the platforms, Patriot Package subscribers will accumulate gems on their Truth Social accounts.

At the moment, the social media platform is offering users a free trial of the Patriot Package on its beta test link. In addition, the platform is also asking users for feedback on gem designs for the rewards program. The gems will be linked to the utility token, which has yet to be revealed.

2025-07-10T06:30:27,"Bitcoin Rally Ahead? DXY Breakdown Suggests Capital Shift To Risk-On Assets","The US national debt recently hit a new all-time high (ATH), surging above $36.5 trillion and putting significant pressure on the US Dollar Index (DXY). As the DXY struggles under the weight of mounting debt, crypto analysts believe capital may soon shift to risk-on assets like Bitcoin (BTC). DXY Breakdown Suggests Bitcoin Rally According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Darkfost, the DXY has dropped to a historically weak level, currently trading 6.5 points below its 200-day moving average (MA) – the largest deviation in the past 21 years. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Floor Rises Toward $100,000, Reinforcing Bullish Sentiment For the uninitiated, the DXY measures the value of the US dollar relative to a basket of six major foreign currencies, including the euro, yen, pound, Canadian dollar, Swedish krona, and Swiss franc. It is widely used as an indicator of USD strength or weakness and often influences investor sentiment across global financial markets. While a breakdown in the DXY might seem alarming at first, it historically benefits risk-on assets like BTC. A weakening dollar typically precedes capital rotation into alternative asset classes. Following that logic, the recent softness in the USD could prompt investors to reassess their portfolios – potentially increasing allocation to digital assets. Darkfost illustrated this point with the below chart. The chart highlights periods where the DXY traded below its 365-day MA. Historically, these phases have aligned with strong BTC price appreciation. The analyst added: We are currently in a phase where the weakness of the DXY could fuel a new rise in BTC but the price didn’t reacted yet. This tool serves as a valuable indicator for identifying early bull market phases and periods of euphoria, not because of pure technical triggers, but because it reflects increasing liquidity potentially flowing into crypto markets. According to data from CoingGecko, BTC is currently trading just about 2.2% below its ATH of $111,814 recorded on May 22. With BTC decisively breaking through a bullish flag, the flagship cryptocurrency looks set to hit a new ATH in the near-term. Some Warning Signs To Watch Out For Despite a favorable macro backdrop, several warning signs could dampen BTC’s bullish momentum. For instance, Bitcoin’s Apparent Demand metric has recently turned negative. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Dominance Signals Weak Hands Capitulating, Strong Hands Rising Similarly, some on-chain metrics suggest that the BTC rally may be running out of steam. Bitcoin’s NVT Golden Cross recently showed signs of a potential local top. That said, Bitcoin continues to show resilience, absorbing persistent selling pressure in the derivatives market and avoiding a breakdown below the $100,000 mark. At press time, BTC trades at $109,520, up 0.7% over the past 24 hours.

Fueled by: • $1.2B #ETF inflows ( #BlackRock , Fidelity leading the charge) • Total spot #BTC ETF volume reached $4B today. • Open interest in $BTC … pic.twitter.com/khCfos8q3G — Coinpedia Markets (@MarketCoinpedia) July 10, 2025 Bitcoin Hovers Near ATH Amid Weak Dollar and Fed Optimism Bitcoin’s surge comes as investor sentiment improves in response to a weakening U.S. dollar and postponed trade tariffs. Expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts later this year have also lifted risk appetite across financial markets. As investors turn to alternative assets, Bitcoin is benefiting from this increased confidence. Meanwhile, following a successful retest around $104,400, analyst Rekt Capital confirmed the downtrend is over, with targets now set at $120K and beyond. Bitcoin has officially made a new all-time high, achieving a market value of $112,152 just 30 minutes ago. Unsurprisingly, many retailers had been dropping out due to boredom or disbelief over the past few days.

Today’s pattern reflects that trend, pointing to further upside as BTC trades solidly above $112K . Altcoins Join the Rally The bullish momentum isn’t limited to Bitcoin. Several altcoins are rallying, led by Stellar (XLM), which jumped 11.7% amid renewed interest in its cross-border payments use case. Lido DAO (LDO) gained 11.1% as demand for liquid staking solutions grew. Memecoins are also seeing action, Dogwifhat (WIF) and Pepe (PEPE) both surged nearly 11%, showing speculative interest remains strong. Ripple’s XRP rose over 5%, while Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA) all climbed 4–6%, backed by increased trading volumes and broader market optimism. Sentiment was further boosted by corporate crypto endorsements from firms like GameSquare and SharpLink Gaming. Short Liquidations At Play A significant part of Bitcoin’s move is being fueled by liquidations. In the past 24 hours, $465 million worth of short positions were wiped out, pushing prices higher. Total liquidations reached $529 million, showing the force of the short squeeze. Bitcoin’s daily trading volume jumped 45% to over $60 billion, while futures open interest rose to $79 billion, reflecting growing bullish sentiment. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Changpeng Zhao’s YZi Labs Launches BNB-Based Treasury Company , Crypto Week On the Roll Adding fuel to the rally, Congress is gearing up for “ Crypto Week ” from July 14–19, where lawmakers plan to push forward major crypto-related legislation. Key among them are the CLARITY Act , which would clarify jurisdiction between the SEC and CFTC, and the GENIUS Act , targeting stablecoin regulation. Leaders like Ripple’s Brad Garlinghouse and Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong are urging Congress to act fast. Institutional and Macro Tailwinds Strengthen Rally Institutional confidence is also rising, with crypto assets appearing on more corporate balance sheets. Spot Ethereum ETFs have seen over $2 billion in inflows, showing growing demand for regulated exposure to crypto. Macro trends are playing a big role too; the weakening U.S. dollar and delayed tariffs are making risk assets more attractive. As global equities rally on tech and AI enthusiasm, crypto is moving in sync, with Bitcoin’s resilience highlighting renewed investor trust. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The crypto market is up today due to a combination of factors, including increased institutional demand (e.g., from traditional financial firms), positive macroeconomic signals like a weakening U.S. dollar and anticipated Fed rate cuts, and a surge in investor confidence. Bitcoin has hit a new all-time high, pulling altcoins along with it.

2025-07-10T06:07:47,"Shiba Inu Smashes Triangle Pattern Against Bitcoin, But Looks Weak Against Dogecoin","Shiba Inu's (SHIB) dollar-denominated price hit a one-month high, charting a bullish trend against Bitcoin. However, the outlook against its rival, dogecoin, doesn't look as promising. SHIB has gained 5.2% in the past 24 hours, reaching a high of $0.00001255 on Coinbase, the level last seen on June 12. As of writing, the cryptocurrency teased a breakout into bullish territory above the widely tracked 50-day simple moving average (SMA) at $0.00001242. Key AI insights based on the 24-hour price action Institutional flows drove prices from $0.00001215 to a peak of $0.00001250 between 19:00 and 20:00 on July 9, with an exceptional institutional volume of 1.25 trillion tokens. Strong institutional resistance has been established around the $0.00001250 level, significantly exceeding the average daily institutional volume of 491 billion tokens. An additional 2.54% institutional gains occurred during the final trading hour from July 10, 03:56 to 04:55, advancing from $0.00001244 to $0.00001247. A session low of $0.00001238, established around 04:15, indicates what institutional traders view as strong technical support within the $0.00001238-$0.00001240 range. SHIB/BTC breakout The SHIB/BTC pair listed on CoinEx, which represents SHIB's BTC-denominated price, rose 3.70% Wednesday (UTC), rising out of a triangular consolidation pattern identified by trendlines connecting June 24 and July 3 highs and June 22, June 27 and July 4 lows, according to data source TradingView. The breakout follows a prolonged year-long downtrend and indicates that the bulls have emerged victorious, having successfully absorbed supply during the triangular consolidation. The pair, therefore, could continue to gain ground in the short term, supported by a positive MACD histogram, which points to a strengthening of upward momentum. The swing low from May 7, represented by the horizontal line on the chart below, could offer resistance on the way higher. SHIB/DOGE breaks down SHIB could underperform DOGE in the coming days, as the Binance-listed SHIB/BTC pair has penetrated a trendline support, marking the end of the recovery rally from May lows. Furthermore, the Guppy multiple moving average indicator appears poised to cross bearish, indicating a negative shift in momentum. The bear cross occurs when the band of short-term exponential moving averages (EMAs) moves below the long-term EMAs. The pair needs to top the June 24 high of 0.0000719 to negate the bearish outlook.

2025-07-10T06:07:23,"Аналитик считает восстановление цены Bitcoin попыткой “вытряхнуть” слабых игроков с рынка.","За последнюю неделю цена Bitcoin выросла и ненадолго поднялась выше отметки в $110 000, прежде чем откатиться обратно вниз. Это указало на устойчивый рост участия, поскольку криптоинвесторы снова начали делать свои ставки. Однако, хотя рынок приветствовал этот рост, криптоаналитик Xanrox назвал его медвежьим развитием событий. Анализ фокусируется на восходящем тренде цены Биткоина, в результате которого он достиг отметки в $110 000. Но он отмечает, что вместо полного прорыва цифровой актив не смог продолжить свой восходящий тренд даже после выхода из нисходящего канала. Учитывая это, Xanrox объясняет, что это ложный прорыв паттерна, или то, что обычно известно в криптосообществе как “ловушка для быков”. Особенность бычьих ловушек в том, что они в конечном счете носят медвежий характер. Итак, хотя цена биткоина, похоже, находится в восходящем тренде, если Xanrox прав, то это означает, что вскоре криптовалюта столкнется с падением, что приведет к резкому падению цен.Кроме того, аналитик объясняет, что восходящий тренд прошлой недели теперь удерживает “быков” в длинных позициях, в то время как “китам” потребуется ликвидность в виде ордеров и стоп-лоссов. Таким образом, чтобы захватить эту ликвидность, китам нужно будет направить цену вниз, и наиболее вероятным виновником этого является коррекция Фибоначчи на 0,618 от предыдущей импульсной волны чуть ниже $103 000. Прогноз самой выгодной цены для входа в BTC Чтобы понять, куда может направиться цена Bitcoin дальше, криптоаналитик применяет к текущему тренду теорию волн Эллиотта. Он объясняет, что Волна 1 уже завершена, а это означает, что сейчас в игре медвежья Волна 2, которая представляет собой коррекцию ABC.В связи с формированием этой коррекции аналитик советует инвесторам подождать, прежде чем открывать длинную позицию. Уровень коррекции Фибоначчи 0,618 находится на отметке $102 909, что делает это время лучшим для входа в цифровой актив. Xanrox также указывает, что существует незаполненный разрыв справедливой стоимости (FVG) между $102 000 и $104 000, который, как ожидается, быстро заполнится в это время. Однако, несмотря на ожидаемую коррекцию, общий тренд для цены Bitcoin остается бычьим в соответствии с теорией волн Эллиотта. Если Волна 2 отыграет полностью, то ожидается начало Волны 3, которая обычно является еще более бычьим движением по сравнению с Волной 1 и может направить BTC к новым историческим максимумам. Цена BTC не прошла повторное тестирование на уровне $109 000 | Источник: BTCUSD на TradingView.com Bitcoin Hyper привлекает $2,1 млн для масштабирования BTC: какие перспективы? Одной из самых интересных предпродаж лета 2025 стал проект Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) , криптовалюта ERC-20, которая на данный момент собрала чуть более $2,1 млн в ходе своего ICO. Bitcoin Hyper сейчас находится на стадии разработки собственной сети второго уровня для Биткоина, что как раз объясняет, почему так много инвесторов спешат присоединиться к его предпродаже. Как L2-сеть, Bitcoin Hyper обеспечит значительно более низкие комиссии за транзакции и существенно большую пропускную способность, чем у самого BTC. Предлагается удобный мост для перехода на и с основной цепочки, при этом внесенные BTC конвертируются в эквивалент ERC для использования в сети Bitcoin Hyper. Она будет совместима с Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), что обеспечит высокий уровень производительности. Токен HYPER будет необходим для оплаты комиссий за транзакции, а его держатели смогут также пассивно зарабатывать на стейкинге.Присоединяйтесь к предпродаже уже сейчас, пока стоимость токена всего $0,0122: переходите на Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) и следите за обновлениями.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/analitik-schitaet-vosstanovlenie-cen/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Uncategorized",cryptocompare
2025-07-10T06:00:34,"Markets Turn Green as $BTC, $ETH, $SOL, and $XRP Pump — Is This Just the Beginning?","Bitcoin price rallied to a new all-time high of $112k, triggering a wider altcoin pump today. On-chain data suggests the bullish outlook was bolstered by rising demand from whales amid waning retail speculation. Technical analysis suggests the crypto market is not yet out of the woods but the bulls have the upper hand. Bitcoin (BTC) price rallied 2.5% in the past 24 hours to reach a new all-time high of slightly above $112k, before retracing to trade about $111,112 on Thursday, July 10, during the early European session. The wider altcoin market- led by Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE) – rallied in tandem.

While cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are not recognized as legal tender, they operate in a regulatory grey area with evolving tax and compliance frameworks. Over 107 million Indians now engage with crypto assets. Below is a timeline of key crypto regulation updates in India during 2025, Table of contents Crypto Regulation India Timeline – 2025 Crypto Tax in India – 2025 (Fact-Checked) Crypto Adoption in India (2025 Snapshot) Conclusion FAQs Crypto Regulation India Timeline – 2025 June 2025 : Discussion paper on Cryptocurrency The Indian government planned to release a discussion paper to establish a regulatory framework for crypto in India. The initiative also promised to seek public consultation on– stakeholders, including financial institutions, legal experts, crypto companies, and the general public. May 22, 2025 : FSB Peer Review Preparation India gears up for the Financial Stability Board (FSB) review in October, aiming to align local crypto regulation with global regulatory standards. April 1, 2025 : SEBI Oversight Begins SEBI starts monitoring crypto tokens that resemble securities. A multi-agency regulatory model is proposed, including RBI, SEBI, and the Finance Ministry. February 13, 2025 : VDA Income Tax Amendment Bill Introduced The bill expands the scope of Virtual Digital Assets (VDAs) to include NFTs and undisclosed income. However, the 30% tax rate remains unchanged. February 10, 2025 : Crypto Exchanges Declared Reporting Entities Exchanges, wallets, and even mining pools are categorized as “reporting entities.” They must report all transactions to tax authorities under the new AML Crypto Tax in India – 2025 (Fact-Checked) As of now, no official reduction has been made to the 30% tax on crypto gains or the 1% TDS , despite industry demands. 1. For Investors and Traders Flat 30% Tax on gains from crypto sales, swaps, or gifts. No deductions allowed except for cost of acquisition. 1% TDS on transfers above ₹10,000 (buyer deducts and remits). No loss set-off or carry-forward permitted. Example: Buy BTC at ₹2.72 lakh → Sell at ₹8.72 lakh → ₹6 lakh profit → Tax = ₹1.8 lakh + TDS = ₹6,000 2. For Crypto Companies & Exchanges KYC/AML compliance is mandatory. 1% TDS to be collected and remitted on every qualifying user transaction. Transaction reporting to tax authorities under PMLA and IT laws. Category Tax Rate TDS Example Investors 30% 1% if >₹10k ₹50k profit → ₹15k tax + ₹500 TDS Traders 30% 1% if >₹10k Taxed as business income Companies NA 1% collected ₹10L transaction → ₹10k TDS Crypto Adoption in India (2025 Snapshot) Active Users : Over 107.3 million Indians (7.37% of population) hold or trade crypto. Revenue Forecast : India’s crypto market is projected to hit $6.4 billion by year-end. Exchanges : Platforms like CoinDCX, CoinSwitch, and Mudrex offer access to over 500 tokens. Growth Drivers : Rising financial inclusion, smartphone penetration, and blockchain innovation. Government Holdings : No official disclosure yet; policies prioritize transparency and user safety. Conclusion India’s crypto regulation in 2025 reflects a delicate balance between enabling innovation and enforcing oversight. With strict taxes (30% + 1% TDS) and real-time transaction reporting, the government is creating a compliant ecosystem without enforcing an outright ban. As the FSB review nears, clarity in crypto regulation India could open new doors for mass adoption and position the country at the forefront of the $7 trillion global digital economy. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-10T05:53:17,"Trump Jr. Buys Stake in Cash-Burning Social Media App Building Bitcoin Reserve","Donald Trump Jr. has snapped up 350,000 shares in Thumzup Media Corp., a struggling Los Angeles-based social media startup that is stockpiling Bitcoin despite reporting just $151 in revenue last quarter. The stake, disclosed in a Wednesday filing , was worth more than $4m at the previous close of $12.36 per share. Trump Jr. reportedly made the investment on his adviser’s recommendation and holds no further involvement with the company, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. The filing followed a $6m private placement of convertible preferred stock arranged by Dominari Securities. Both Trump Jr. and his brother Eric serve as advisors to the parent of that firm. Image Source: Thumzup Media SEC filing Thumzup Leans Into Crypto, Trump’s Family Doubles Down Thumzup offers an app that pays users for product recommendations on Instagram. It recorded a $2.2m loss on just $151 in revenue in Q1. Still, its stock soared almost 75% over the prior four sessions before tumbling 17% by mid‑Wednesday. In January, Thumzup made a notable pivot by announcing it would hold most of its liquid assets in Bitcoin. Since then, it has accumulated over $2m worth of the crypto asset. Now, the company plans to diversify further by adding six more coins, using funds raised in its latest round. The purchase deepens the Trump family’s involvement in crypto treasury strategies. Trump-linked entities have embraced Bitcoin hoarding across ventures, ranging from Dominari’s ETF investments, Metaplanet advisory board roles, to Trump Media & Technology Group’s $2.3b Bitcoin deployment. Trump Bets Big on Crypto, Raising Eyebrows Over Conflicts and Controversy Donald Trump has shifted from crypto skeptic to advocate, promoting policies to make the US the “crypto capital of the world.” His investments, including World Liberty Financial , the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins and NFT deals, have reportedly generated nearly $1b in revenue . These intertwined ventures have drawn scrutiny over potential conflicts, insider governance, and ties to controversial investors. Yet they continue to benefit from a rising regulatory tide and the Trump administration’s pro‑crypto posture.

2025-07-10T05:30:00,"Trump Jr Invests Millions in Bitcoin Treasury Company","Thumzup began accumulating BTC in late 2024 and now holds over $2.1 million worth. This trend mirrors the overall corporate shift towards Bitcoin reserves, which was popularized by Michael Saylor’s Strategy. Meanwhile, Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao is backing a new venture—BNB Treasury Company—aiming to give institutional investors exposure to BNB via a US-listed vehicle. Remixpoint, a Tokyo-based fintech and energy firm, is also making headlines after raising $215 million to triple its Bitcoin holdings to 3,000 BTC, with its CEO now also taking his salary in Bitcoin. Trump Jr Buys Into BTC Focused Media Company Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of US President Donald Trump, revealed an investment in Thumzup Media Corp, a social media marketing firm that adopted a Bitcoin-centric treasury strategy. According to Bloomberg, Trump Jr. owns 350,000 shares of the company, which is currently worth nearly $3.3 million based on a trading price of about $9.50 per share. Thumzup Media Corp share price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google Finance ) Thumzup’s embrace of Bitcoin began in November of 2024 when its board authorized the purchase of up to $1 million in BTC as part of its corporate treasury. CEO Robert Steele explained that the move was driven by the rise of Bitcoin ETFs and increased institutional support. Bitcoin's scarcity and inflation-resistant properties were also valuable traits that were considered for safeguarding company capital. Thumzup’s BTC holdings over time (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) To expand its position even more, Thumzup filed a universal shelf registration with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in May, to raise $200 million through debt and equity financing. As of now, the company holds 19.11 BTC, currently valued at over $2.1 million. The trend of companies like Thumzup adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset led to a wider discussion on the long-term viability of this strategy. Since 2024, there has been a surge in firms adding Bitcoin to their treasuries, with 258 institutions now listed on BitcoinTreasuries, ranging from public and private companies to crypto-native custodians and even government-linked entities. The movement was originally popularized by Michael Saylor, the co-founder of Strategy, who pivoted his business intelligence firm into a Bitcoin-focused treasury company back in 2020. Despite the growing list of adopters, some analysts are still skeptical about the sustainability of the trend. Critics argue that many of these newer entrants lack the strong conviction that is necessary to endure the extreme volatility of the crypto market. Bitcoin maximalist Max Keiser explained that Saylor and his company have already proven their resilience through multiple market downturns, unlike the recent wave of companies whose conviction has yet to be tested. A June report from venture capital firm Breed shared very similar concerns, and warned that most Bitcoin treasury companies could fail during the next bearish cycle. This could trigger a potential cascade of selloffs that may deepen any future downturn. CZ Backs New BNB Treasury Firm Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao’s family office is also backing a new investment venture that aims to give institutional and retail investors exposure to BNB through a publicly listed company in the United States. YZi Labs announced that it will support 10X Capital in launching the “BNB Treasury Company,” which plans to list on a major US exchange. The new firm will be led by David Namdar, a senior partner at 10X Capital and co-founder of Galaxy Digital, and 10X Capital will act as the company’s asset manager. This initiative is also part of the trend among firms aiming to create public vehicles for cryptocurrency exposure. BNB is the native token of the Binance ecosystem, and was originally created to provide trading discounts. It now powers applications across the BNB Chain, a blockchain that was launched by Binance in 2019. Ella Zhang, head of YZi Labs, stated that expanding institutional access to BNB could provide many meaningful benefits to the broader public. 10X Capital founder Hans Thomas stated that although BNB is one of the largest and most active ecosystems globally, US investors have had limited access to its growth. The BNB Treasury Company expects to announce the closure of its financing round in the coming weeks. Exchange-tied tokens like BNB serve as both user incentives and funding mechanisms for crypto platforms. While Binance created BNB and its blockchain, the company claims not to be directly involved in their ongoing development. However, Zhao revealed in February that nearly all of his crypto holdings—98.5%—are in BNB. According to Forbes , Zhao controls approximately 94 million BNB tokens, which equates to over 64% of its circulating supply. Binance controls an additional 31.5%. Combined, Zhao and Binance reportedly control close to 96% of all circulating BNB , currently worth around $63 billion. Despite being barred from managing Binance as part of a money laundering settlement with US authorities, Zhao is still the company’s largest shareholder. On Wednesday, he posted on X that more than 30 teams are interested in launching similar BNB-focused public treasury firms. While Bitcoin is the primary focus of most corporate crypto treasuries, BNB is beginning to attract institutional attention. Nasdaq-listed Nano Labs recently announced plans to purchase up to $1 billion worth of BNB, having already acquired $50 million. Remixpoint Plans to Triple Bitcoin Holdings Meanwhile, Tokyo-based energy and fintech firm Remixpoint announced that it raised 31.5 billion yen, or approximately $215 million, to expand its Bitcoin treasury reserves. The company revealed on X that the entire sum will be used for purchasing Bitcoin, which will help in its aggressive push into digital asset accumulation. The capital was secured through its 25th series of stock acquisition rights and the fourth series of unsecured bonds, which will result in the issuance of 55 million new shares—equivalent to a 39.9% dilution. The shares will be issued at market price without any discount. Remixpoint announcement on X Remixpoint stated that it plans to grow its Bitcoin holdings to 3,000 BTC in the short term. The company currently holds 1,051 BTC, worth over $113.8 million, placing it as the 30th largest Bitcoin-holding corporation according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET . This move happened on the heels of an announcement that CEO Takashi Tashiro will begin receiving his salary in Bitcoin to align his interests with shareholders and reflect the firm’s deepening belief in Bitcoin’s future potential. The board unanimously approved the strategic allocation, due to Bitcoin’s potential to enhance corporate value while balancing risk and flexibility. The company stressed that this decision was only made after very rigorous internal debate and is aimed at seizing long-term opportunity rather than taking reckless risks. Other Japanese companies are also ramping up their crypto holdings. Metaplanet recently purchased an additional 2,204 BTC for $237 million and is reportedly exploring the acquisition of a digital bank.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9876/trump-jr-invests-millions-in-bitcoin-treasury-company,"BTC|BNB|REGULATION|ZRX|EXCHANGE","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-07-10T05:01:54,"Bitcoin Bulls Increase Exposure as Trump's Pressure on Fed Pushes $15B Into BTC ETFs, Analyst Says","The U.S.-listed spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have attracted billions in investor capital in three months, amid increasing political pressure on the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) to cut rates. The relentless flows are now forcing ""under-positioned"" traders to chase upside through derivatives, reviving the bullish momentum in the cryptocurrency, according to Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research . ""The sharp surge in bitcoin ETF inflows since late April 2025 has been primarily driven by political pressure on the Federal Reserve, with Donald Trump openly demanding that Chair Jerome Powell cut rates to 1% and resign. What began as a partisan push has since broadened, with Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte and Senator Cynthia Lummis also calling for Powell to step down, criticizing his perceived hawkish stance,"" Thielen said in a note to clients Thursday. Trump's repeated attacks on the Federal Reserve have revived memories of Turkish President Erdogan's similar actions between 2019 and 2021, which led to a broad-based shift away from Turkish assets and a crash in the Lira. Back then, Erdogan issued multiple decrees dismissing central bank officials for not cutting rates. Meanwhile, Trump has repeatedly called for Powell's resignation, saying his reluctance to cut rates is costing America billions of dollars. The minutes of the Fed meeting held on July 17-18 showed a growing divide over how policy should proceed from here. According to CNBC, Opinions ranged from a ""couple"" of officials who said the next cut could come as soon as this month to ""some"" who thought no reductions this year would be appropriate. Under-positioned bulls re-enter The relentless ETF flows, combined with growing pressure on the Fed to cut rates, are finally forcing traders, who have been hesitant to commit to bullish trades, to re-enter the market fully. ""Since mid-April, Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated $15 billion worth of Bitcoin, and notably, this buying has continued uninterrupted, even as Bitcoin has consolidated since mid-May. This steady demand now appears to be forcing underpositioned traders back into the market, as suggested by positioning data from the derivatives space,"" Thielen said. Traders have been chasing call options at strikes $130,000, as CoinDesk noted early this week. A call option represents a bullish bet on the market, with the demand for the $ 130,000 call reflecting expectations for a price surge above that level. These bullish flows are consistent with the positive seasonality typically observed in July. Data tracked by Coinglass shows BTC has put in a positive performance in July in eight out of the past 12 years, with an average gain of over 7%. ""Combined with historically strong seasonality in July and potential bullish catalysts from upcoming macro data and policy developments, the backdrop remains supportive for further upside,"" Thielen noted. Bitcoin hit a record high of nearly $112,000 on some exchanges late Wednesday, according to data source CoinDesk.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/10/bitcoin-bulls-increase-exposure-as-trump-s-pressure-on-fed-pushes-usd15b-into-btc-etfs-analyst-says,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|FIAT|ZRX","Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Bitcoin ETF|News",cryptocompare
2025-07-10T05:00:25,"Is Bitcoin Ready to Pop? Analyst Warns of Sell-Side Liquidity Squeeze as Whales Take Over","Bitcoin continues to hover just below its previous all-time high, consolidating around the $109,000 mark despite a modest 1.9% gain over the past day. The asset reached a 7-day high of $110,307 but has yet to reclaim the historic high of $111,814, a level set back in May. While short-term price action remains within a tight range, on-chain data reveals deeper structural developments that could shape Bitcoin’s trajectory in the weeks ahead. As attention focuses on Bitcoin’s potential for a breakout, some analysts are turning to supply dynamics for clues. One notable observation comes from CryptoQuant contributor Chairman Lee, who has identified a significant reduction in BTC held on centralized exchanges. This trend may serve as a key indicator of future price behavior, especially in the context of institutional demand and exchange activity. Related Reading: Last Time This Happened, Bitcoin Jumped $50,000—Is History Repeating? Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Drop to Multi-Year Lows Chairman Lee’s analysis highlights a continued decline in exchange-held Bitcoin, with reserves falling to a multi-year low of 2.4 million BTC. This figure is down from over 3.1 million BTC reported in mid-2023. The consistent drawdown in exchange balances is interpreted as a signal that selling pressure is decreasing, which historically has preceded price expansions. According to Lee, “This persistent decline in reserve levels suggests that sell-side liquidity is drying up… Historically, such conditions—where BTC held on exchanges is low—precede major bullish expansions as demand exceeds supply.” In past market cycles, including the 2020–2021 bull run, similar drops in exchange reserves were followed by sharp upward movements in Bitcoin’s price. The logic is based on basic supply-demand mechanics: when available BTC becomes scarce on exchanges, any increase in demand, particularly from ETFs or institutional buyers, can lead to accelerated price growth. Lee emphasizes that this current trend could act as a foundational tailwind, potentially supporting further gains if current demand patterns remain in place. Binance Dominates Whale Transaction Flows Another piece of the market structure puzzle comes from CryptoQuant analyst Crazzyblockk, who examined large-scale BTC transactions across major centralized exchanges. According to his report, Binance has maintained its position as the dominant venue for Bitcoin whale activity. Whale flows are defined in this context as daily inflows or outflows exceeding 1,000 BTC. Binance has recorded cumulative whale inflows of 31.36 million BTC and outflows of 30.82 million BTC, along with 53.2 million whale transactions, significantly more than any other exchange. Notably, these numbers do not reflect unique BTC, but rather total flow volumes that include repeated movements of the same coins. High transaction volumes suggest Binance is favored for its liquidity and infrastructure, allowing whales to engage in trading, custody shifts, and arbitrage with minimal friction.

The data also places HTX Global and Kraken in the second and third positions, respectively, for whale inflows, though their volumes are substantially lower than Binance’s.

Set to launch at $0.06, buyers now lock in a guaranteed 100% return. Here’s why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ranks among the best crypto to buy today. Mutuum Finance price prediction: echoes of Bitcoin’s 2020-2021 surge Analysts are buzzing about Mutuum Finance (MUTM) hitting $3 in 2025. Starting at $0.03 now, that’s a jaw-dropping 10,000% leap, or 100x for early buyers. This isn’t wild guessing; it’s grounded in the project’s sturdy DeFi roots. Look back at Bitcoin’s run from 2020 to 2021 for context. Bitcoin dipped to $2,900 in March 2020, then rocketed to $69,000 by November 2021. That’s a 1590% ROI in just 14 months. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could follow a similar arc, fueled by its lending innovation and community hype. Buying now at $0.03 doubles your money at launch. Post-launch, a climb to $3 offers colossal gains. This potential makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a top pick among the best crypto to buy now. Dual lending model fuels growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rolling out a game-changing dual lending system. It mixes Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) setups. The P2C side uses smart contracts to tweak interest rates on the fly, keeping things steady for users. Meanwhile, P2P lets lenders and borrowers hash out deals directly, cutting out middlemen.

The initiative will test 19 pilot programs using real money and assets for the first time, alongside five proof-of-concept trials involving simulated transactions.</p><p>The trials span various asset classes, including fixed income, private markets, trade receivables, and carbon credits. Settlement methods will explore CBDCs, stablecoins, bank deposit tokens, and innovative applications of existing commercial bank deposits held at the RBA. Testing will occur over the next six months using platforms such as Hedera, Redbelly, R3 Corda, and Canvas Connect, with a final report expected in the first half of 2026.</p><p>RBA Assistant Governor Brad Jones said the selected use cases will help assess how both central bank and private digital money, alongside payments infrastructure, could enhance Australia's wholesale financial markets. The RBA remains focused on wholesale applications, having found limited economic justification for a retail digital currency. Expected benefits include lower risks, improved transparency, better collateral efficiency, and cost reductions.</p>
