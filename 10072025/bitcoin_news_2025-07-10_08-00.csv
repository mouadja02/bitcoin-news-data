The stake, disclosed in a Wednesday filing , was worth more than $4m at the previous close of $12.36 per share. Trump Jr. reportedly made the investment on his adviser’s recommendation and holds no further involvement with the company, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. The filing followed a $6m private placement of convertible preferred stock arranged by Dominari Securities. Both Trump Jr. and his brother Eric serve as advisors to the parent of that firm. Image Source: Thumzup Media SEC filing Thumzup Leans Into Crypto, Trump’s Family Doubles Down Thumzup offers an app that pays users for product recommendations on Instagram. It recorded a $2.2m loss on just $151 in revenue in Q1. Still, its stock soared almost 75% over the prior four sessions before tumbling 17% by mid‑Wednesday. In January, Thumzup made a notable pivot by announcing it would hold most of its liquid assets in Bitcoin. Since then, it has accumulated over $2m worth of the crypto asset. Now, the company plans to diversify further by adding six more coins, using funds raised in its latest round. The purchase deepens the Trump family’s involvement in crypto treasury strategies. Trump-linked entities have embraced Bitcoin hoarding across ventures, ranging from Dominari’s ETF investments, Metaplanet advisory board roles, to Trump Media & Technology Group’s $2.3b Bitcoin deployment. Trump Bets Big on Crypto, Raising Eyebrows Over Conflicts and Controversy Donald Trump has shifted from crypto skeptic to advocate, promoting policies to make the US the “crypto capital of the world.” His investments, including World Liberty Financial , the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins and NFT deals, have reportedly generated nearly $1b in revenue . These intertwined ventures have drawn scrutiny over potential conflicts, insider governance, and ties to controversial investors. Yet they continue to benefit from a rising regulatory tide and the Trump administration’s pro‑crypto posture.

2025-07-10T05:30:00,"Trump Jr Invests Millions in Bitcoin Treasury Company","Thumzup began accumulating BTC in late 2024 and now holds over $2.1 million worth. This trend mirrors the overall corporate shift towards Bitcoin reserves, which was popularized by Michael Saylor’s Strategy. Meanwhile, Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao is backing a new venture—BNB Treasury Company—aiming to give institutional investors exposure to BNB via a US-listed vehicle. Remixpoint, a Tokyo-based fintech and energy firm, is also making headlines after raising $215 million to triple its Bitcoin holdings to 3,000 BTC, with its CEO now also taking his salary in Bitcoin. Trump Jr Buys Into BTC Focused Media Company Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of US President Donald Trump, revealed an investment in Thumzup Media Corp, a social media marketing firm that adopted a Bitcoin-centric treasury strategy. According to Bloomberg, Trump Jr. owns 350,000 shares of the company, which is currently worth nearly $3.3 million based on a trading price of about $9.50 per share. Thumzup Media Corp share price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google Finance ) Thumzup’s embrace of Bitcoin began in November of 2024 when its board authorized the purchase of up to $1 million in BTC as part of its corporate treasury. CEO Robert Steele explained that the move was driven by the rise of Bitcoin ETFs and increased institutional support. Bitcoin's scarcity and inflation-resistant properties were also valuable traits that were considered for safeguarding company capital. Thumzup’s BTC holdings over time (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) To expand its position even more, Thumzup filed a universal shelf registration with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in May, to raise $200 million through debt and equity financing. As of now, the company holds 19.11 BTC, currently valued at over $2.1 million. The trend of companies like Thumzup adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset led to a wider discussion on the long-term viability of this strategy. Since 2024, there has been a surge in firms adding Bitcoin to their treasuries, with 258 institutions now listed on BitcoinTreasuries, ranging from public and private companies to crypto-native custodians and even government-linked entities. The movement was originally popularized by Michael Saylor, the co-founder of Strategy, who pivoted his business intelligence firm into a Bitcoin-focused treasury company back in 2020. Despite the growing list of adopters, some analysts are still skeptical about the sustainability of the trend. Critics argue that many of these newer entrants lack the strong conviction that is necessary to endure the extreme volatility of the crypto market. Bitcoin maximalist Max Keiser explained that Saylor and his company have already proven their resilience through multiple market downturns, unlike the recent wave of companies whose conviction has yet to be tested. A June report from venture capital firm Breed shared very similar concerns, and warned that most Bitcoin treasury companies could fail during the next bearish cycle. This could trigger a potential cascade of selloffs that may deepen any future downturn. CZ Backs New BNB Treasury Firm Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao’s family office is also backing a new investment venture that aims to give institutional and retail investors exposure to BNB through a publicly listed company in the United States. YZi Labs announced that it will support 10X Capital in launching the “BNB Treasury Company,” which plans to list on a major US exchange. The new firm will be led by David Namdar, a senior partner at 10X Capital and co-founder of Galaxy Digital, and 10X Capital will act as the company’s asset manager. This initiative is also part of the trend among firms aiming to create public vehicles for cryptocurrency exposure. BNB is the native token of the Binance ecosystem, and was originally created to provide trading discounts. It now powers applications across the BNB Chain, a blockchain that was launched by Binance in 2019. Ella Zhang, head of YZi Labs, stated that expanding institutional access to BNB could provide many meaningful benefits to the broader public. 10X Capital founder Hans Thomas stated that although BNB is one of the largest and most active ecosystems globally, US investors have had limited access to its growth. The BNB Treasury Company expects to announce the closure of its financing round in the coming weeks. Exchange-tied tokens like BNB serve as both user incentives and funding mechanisms for crypto platforms. While Binance created BNB and its blockchain, the company claims not to be directly involved in their ongoing development. However, Zhao revealed in February that nearly all of his crypto holdings—98.5%—are in BNB. According to Forbes , Zhao controls approximately 94 million BNB tokens, which equates to over 64% of its circulating supply. Binance controls an additional 31.5%. Combined, Zhao and Binance reportedly control close to 96% of all circulating BNB , currently worth around $63 billion. Despite being barred from managing Binance as part of a money laundering settlement with US authorities, Zhao is still the company’s largest shareholder. On Wednesday, he posted on X that more than 30 teams are interested in launching similar BNB-focused public treasury firms. While Bitcoin is the primary focus of most corporate crypto treasuries, BNB is beginning to attract institutional attention. Nasdaq-listed Nano Labs recently announced plans to purchase up to $1 billion worth of BNB, having already acquired $50 million. Remixpoint Plans to Triple Bitcoin Holdings Meanwhile, Tokyo-based energy and fintech firm Remixpoint announced that it raised 31.5 billion yen, or approximately $215 million, to expand its Bitcoin treasury reserves. The company revealed on X that the entire sum will be used for purchasing Bitcoin, which will help in its aggressive push into digital asset accumulation. The capital was secured through its 25th series of stock acquisition rights and the fourth series of unsecured bonds, which will result in the issuance of 55 million new shares—equivalent to a 39.9% dilution. The shares will be issued at market price without any discount. Remixpoint announcement on X Remixpoint stated that it plans to grow its Bitcoin holdings to 3,000 BTC in the short term. The company currently holds 1,051 BTC, worth over $113.8 million, placing it as the 30th largest Bitcoin-holding corporation according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET . This move happened on the heels of an announcement that CEO Takashi Tashiro will begin receiving his salary in Bitcoin to align his interests with shareholders and reflect the firm’s deepening belief in Bitcoin’s future potential. The board unanimously approved the strategic allocation, due to Bitcoin’s potential to enhance corporate value while balancing risk and flexibility. The company stressed that this decision was only made after very rigorous internal debate and is aimed at seizing long-term opportunity rather than taking reckless risks. Other Japanese companies are also ramping up their crypto holdings.

Sun used the following statements in his post on X (formerly Twitter) today: “We are committed to the $100 million acquisition of TRUMP! TRUMP and TRON together are the future of crypto.

Shortly after Trump was elected president in November 2024, Sun invested $30 million in World Liberty Financial, another crypto project named after the president.

2025-07-10T05:01:54,"Bitcoin Bulls Increase Exposure as Trump's Pressure on Fed Pushes $15B Into BTC ETFs, Analyst Says","The U.S.-listed spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have attracted billions in investor capital in three months, amid increasing political pressure on the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) to cut rates. The relentless flows are now forcing ""under-positioned"" traders to chase upside through derivatives, reviving the bullish momentum in the cryptocurrency, according to Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research . ""The sharp surge in bitcoin ETF inflows since late April 2025 has been primarily driven by political pressure on the Federal Reserve, with Donald Trump openly demanding that Chair Jerome Powell cut rates to 1% and resign. What began as a partisan push has since broadened, with Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte and Senator Cynthia Lummis also calling for Powell to step down, criticizing his perceived hawkish stance,"" Thielen said in a note to clients Thursday. Trump's repeated attacks on the Federal Reserve have revived memories of Turkish President Erdogan's similar actions between 2019 and 2021, which led to a broad-based shift away from Turkish assets and a crash in the Lira. Back then, Erdogan issued multiple decrees dismissing central bank officials for not cutting rates. Meanwhile, Trump has repeatedly called for Powell's resignation, saying his reluctance to cut rates is costing America billions of dollars. The minutes of the Fed meeting held on July 17-18 showed a growing divide over how policy should proceed from here. According to CNBC, Opinions ranged from a ""couple"" of officials who said the next cut could come as soon as this month to ""some"" who thought no reductions this year would be appropriate. Under-positioned bulls re-enter The relentless ETF flows, combined with growing pressure on the Fed to cut rates, are finally forcing traders, who have been hesitant to commit to bullish trades, to re-enter the market fully. ""Since mid-April, Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated $15 billion worth of Bitcoin, and notably, this buying has continued uninterrupted, even as Bitcoin has consolidated since mid-May. This steady demand now appears to be forcing underpositioned traders back into the market, as suggested by positioning data from the derivatives space,"" Thielen said. Traders have been chasing call options at strikes $130,000, as CoinDesk noted early this week. A call option represents a bullish bet on the market, with the demand for the $ 130,000 call reflecting expectations for a price surge above that level. These bullish flows are consistent with the positive seasonality typically observed in July. Data tracked by Coinglass shows BTC has put in a positive performance in July in eight out of the past 12 years, with an average gain of over 7%. ""Combined with historically strong seasonality in July and potential bullish catalysts from upcoming macro data and policy developments, the backdrop remains supportive for further upside,"" Thielen noted. Bitcoin hit a record high of nearly $112,000 on some exchanges late Wednesday, according to data source CoinDesk.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/10/bitcoin-bulls-increase-exposure-as-trump-s-pressure-on-fed-pushes-usd15b-into-btc-etfs-analyst-says,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|FIAT|ZRX","Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Bitcoin ETF|News",cryptocompare
2025-07-10T05:00:25,"Is Bitcoin Ready to Pop? Analyst Warns of Sell-Side Liquidity Squeeze as Whales Take Over","Bitcoin continues to hover just below its previous all-time high, consolidating around the $109,000 mark despite a modest 1.9% gain over the past day. The asset reached a 7-day high of $110,307 but has yet to reclaim the historic high of $111,814, a level set back in May. While short-term price action remains within a tight range, on-chain data reveals deeper structural developments that could shape Bitcoin’s trajectory in the weeks ahead. As attention focuses on Bitcoin’s potential for a breakout, some analysts are turning to supply dynamics for clues. One notable observation comes from CryptoQuant contributor Chairman Lee, who has identified a significant reduction in BTC held on centralized exchanges. This trend may serve as a key indicator of future price behavior, especially in the context of institutional demand and exchange activity. Related Reading: Last Time This Happened, Bitcoin Jumped $50,000—Is History Repeating? Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Drop to Multi-Year Lows Chairman Lee’s analysis highlights a continued decline in exchange-held Bitcoin, with reserves falling to a multi-year low of 2.4 million BTC. This figure is down from over 3.1 million BTC reported in mid-2023. The consistent drawdown in exchange balances is interpreted as a signal that selling pressure is decreasing, which historically has preceded price expansions. According to Lee, “This persistent decline in reserve levels suggests that sell-side liquidity is drying up… Historically, such conditions—where BTC held on exchanges is low—precede major bullish expansions as demand exceeds supply.” In past market cycles, including the 2020–2021 bull run, similar drops in exchange reserves were followed by sharp upward movements in Bitcoin’s price. The logic is based on basic supply-demand mechanics: when available BTC becomes scarce on exchanges, any increase in demand, particularly from ETFs or institutional buyers, can lead to accelerated price growth. Lee emphasizes that this current trend could act as a foundational tailwind, potentially supporting further gains if current demand patterns remain in place. Binance Dominates Whale Transaction Flows Another piece of the market structure puzzle comes from CryptoQuant analyst Crazzyblockk, who examined large-scale BTC transactions across major centralized exchanges. According to his report, Binance has maintained its position as the dominant venue for Bitcoin whale activity. Whale flows are defined in this context as daily inflows or outflows exceeding 1,000 BTC. Binance has recorded cumulative whale inflows of 31.36 million BTC and outflows of 30.82 million BTC, along with 53.2 million whale transactions, significantly more than any other exchange. Notably, these numbers do not reflect unique BTC, but rather total flow volumes that include repeated movements of the same coins. High transaction volumes suggest Binance is favored for its liquidity and infrastructure, allowing whales to engage in trading, custody shifts, and arbitrage with minimal friction. Related Reading: Bitcoin & Stablecoin Reserves Diverge On Binance: Liquidity Explosion Brewing? The data also places HTX Global and Kraken in the second and third positions, respectively, for whale inflows, though their volumes are substantially lower than Binance’s.

This Metric Has Quietly Flipped","On-chain data shows the Bitcoin RHODL Ratio has reversed upwards recently, a potential sign that a cycle transition could now be underway. Bitcoin RHODL Ratio Could Be Hinting At Cooling Market Speculation In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed the latest shift in the RHODL Ratio of Bitcoin. The Realized HODL (RHODL) Ratio is an indicator that measures the ratio between the Realized Cap of two given HODL wave bands. The Realized Cap refers to an on-chain capitalization model that calculates BTC’s total value by assuming that the value of each token in circulation is equal to the spot price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. In short, what this metric tracks is the amount of capital that the investors as a whole have put into the cryptocurrency. Here, the Realized Cap of only specific segments of the market is of interest: two “HODL wave bands” or cohorts corresponding to the supply aged between 1 day and 3 months, and that between 6 months and 2 years. Naturally, the former HODL wave band represents the coins that the investors have just purchased. Thus, its Realized Cap would signify the capital that has recently entered into the network. Similarly, the Realized Cap of the latter group would correspond to the capital stored in the hands of resolute individuals . Given this, the RHODL Ratio for these HODL wave bands would tell us about how the capital stored in the two parts of the sector currently compares. Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in this Bitcoin metric over the history of the digital asset. As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin RHODL Ratio has been following an upwards trajectory recently, meaning that capital has been maturing from new hands to the veterans holding for more than six months. Following the latest continuation of the trend, the metric has reached the highest level for the current cycle . “This signals a shift: more wealth is held by single cycle holders, while 1d–3m activity stays low,” notes Glassnode. From the chart, it’s visible that this pattern was generally witnessed alongside transitions during past cycles. And not just any transitions, but those happening away from bull markets. So far, the RHODL Ratio is still far below the peaks seen during the last few Bitcoin cycles, so it only remains to be seen whether the current rise in the indicator is truly the start of a long-term shift like those past ones, or if it’s a temporary deviation.

2025-07-10T03:56:41,"Ether, Dogecoin Lead Crypto Gains as Firms Signal 'Prime' Breakout Chance for Market","Crypto prices extended their rally on Thursday, with Ether and Dogecoin leading the charge, as a combination of supportive risk sentiment and growing political momentum around digital asset legislation helped push markets higher. Bitcoin hovered near its all-time high at $112,000, while Ether surged past $2,780, up nearly 7% over 24 hours. Dogecoin jumped 6%, with broader majors like Solana and XRP also gaining. The CoinDesk 20, a liquid index tracking the largest tokens by market capitalization, minus stablecoins, rose over 2%. Onchain analysis firm Santiment noted that retail trader-based wallets were seemingly absent from the current move, which, historically, sets the stage for sharp upside moves. “History has shown that this is a prime sign of a potential breakout, as crypto markets typically move the opposite direction of the crowd's expectations,” the firm said in an X post. “When retail shows FUD (whether through fear or impatience), these are usually prime spots for smart money to move in and accumulate. This time has been no different.” The moves came as U.S. equity markets digested another round of tariff threats from President Donald Trump, including a 50% levy on copper imports and higher duties on Brazilian goods that sent stocks in the country tumbling. However, U.S. equity-index futures dipped just 0.1% and global tech stocks continued to rally, with Nvidia briefly touching a $4 trillion market cap . Treasury yields softened as bond markets received a bid, suggesting that investors remain positioned for a supportive policy environment, even amid rising geopolitical noise. ""Crypto prices surged to new all-time highs on the back of a supportive risk and equity backdrop,” said Augustine Fan, Head of Insights at SignalPlus. “BTC climbed above $112K after the U.S. House Committee announced next week as 'Crypto Week,’ with a July 16 hearing titled Making America the Crypto Capital of the World. Traders are expecting concrete signals after months of posturing,” Fan added. Fan noted that the market is still operating under a six-month soft target for regulatory recommendations set by President Trump in January.

2025-07-10T03:38:00,"Why is Crypto Market Going Up Today?","The post Why is Crypto Market Going Up Today? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market is back in the green, with Bitcoin making headlines after breaking through the $111,000 resistance level. Earlier today, Bitcoin briefly touched $112,150, crossing its old all-time high by a small margin. Though the price has slightly pulled back to around $111,400, analysts say this move shows strong bullish momentum in the market. Despite fears of market crashes, wars, and negative news, data from charts, on-chain activity, and macroeconomic trends have pointed to a continued uptrend. Many have been expecting this breakout for months and Bitcoin’s next major target could be around $120,000. At the time of writing, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization has climbed to $3.47 trillion, marking a 3.03% increase over the past 24 hours. Ethereum has also slipped in green, trading at $2,786, gaining over 7% in a day. XRP, Solana, and Cardano are showing upward momentum, with XRP up 5%, Solana rising 4%, and Cardano climbing 6.25% in the same period. What’s Next For Bitcoin Price? Bitcoin’s price is currently hovering close to a key resistance zone, awaiting a breakout above the $111,000–$112,000 level. If the price manages to break and hold above this range, it could trigger a new bullish price target around $111,500, with short-term resistance sitting slightly higher at $112,000. On the other side, if Bitcoin fails to break out, it faces support around $107,500, with a deeper support zone near $105,500. At the moment, price action remains mostly sideways on shorter timeframes, forming a symmetrical triangle pattern. However, large amounts of liquidity are building just above and below Bitcoin’s current price, raising the possibility of sudden price moves or fake-outs in the short term. Overall, while momentum is still lacking on higher time frames, the market is on edge waiting for Bitcoin’s next decisive move.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-ethereum-and-xrp-breakout-why-is-crypto-market-going-up-today/,"TRADING|BTC|MARKET|ADA|SOL","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis",cryptocompare
2025-07-10T03:22:11,"Coinbase, Robinhood, and the Race to Put Stocks on the Blockchain","Source: Medium When Bitcoin smashed through $100,000 in December 2024, it wasn’t just another price milestone; it was the culmination of something much bigger. The January 2024 SEC approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs had fundamentally rewired how institutional money flows into crypto, and we were watching the payoff in real time. Here’s what struck me about this moment: after years of regulatory resistance, the approval didn’t just legitimize Bitcoin; it created an entirely new infrastructure layer that traditional finance could finally plug into. The result? Bitcoin went from digital curiosity to portfolio necessity faster than anyone anticipated. The infrastructure shift is where things get interesting. These aren’t your typical investment products. Spot Bitcoin ETFs hold actual Bitcoin, not contracts or derivatives. Think of it like a gold ETF that stores physical bullion, except the “vault” is digital and the custodians are crypto-native companies that suddenly found themselves managing institutional billions. Nine of the twelve currently trading spot Bitcoin ETFs rely on Coinbase for custody. Coinbase’s custody of 9 out of 12 Bitcoin ETFs creates both competitive advantage and concentration risk. This infrastructure dominance generates stable revenue but raises questions about single points of failure in the crypto ecosystem. That’s not an accident; it’s the market recognizing that crypto infrastructure requires crypto expertise. Traditional banks talking about “blockchain solutions” for years suddenly needed companies that actually knew how to secure digital assets at institutional scale. This concentration creates fascinating dynamics. Coinbase transformed from a platform dependent on trading fees (feast during bull markets, famine during crypto winters) into critical financial infrastructure. ETF custody generates predictable revenue regardless of market sentiment. It’s the difference between being a casino and being the bank that handles the casino’s money. The numbers tell the story. Coinbase posted record results through 2024, positioning itself for what analysts expect will be a massive 2025. The company evolved from riding crypto waves to becoming the infrastructure that institutional waves crash against. But infrastructure plays attract competition, and Robinhood has been gaining ground with a different approach. While Coinbase focuses on institutional custody and compliance, Robinhood targets the retail investor frustrated with crypto complexity. The ETF revolution transformed revenue models for crypto platforms. Trading fees dropped from 70% to 35% of revenue while infrastructure services grew from 15% to 45%, creating more predictable business models less dependent on market volatility. Recent moves show this strategy in action: tokenized U.S. stocks across Europe, crypto staking for major cryptocurrencies, perpetual futures trading, and a custom blockchain for real-world asset settlement. Robinhood is building the on-ramp for mainstream adoption while Coinbase manages the vault. The platform’s commission-free crypto trading and streamlined experience have captured market share, particularly as regulatory clarity reduces friction. Record trading volumes and analyst optimism for 2025 suggest this retail-focused approach complements rather than competes with institutional infrastructure. Then there’s BTCS Inc., which offers a different lesson entirely. As the first cryptocurrency company on NASDAQ back in 2014, BTCS represents the pure-play approach to crypto business models. The company pioneered “Bividends” (paying shareholders in Bitcoin rather than cash) and operates blockchain analytics while maintaining direct crypto holdings. BTCS currently holds 90 Bitcoin and has expanded to 12,500 Ethereum through strategic financing. The company demonstrates how crypto-native businesses adapt to institutional validation without abandoning their foundational principles. While giants battle for infrastructure dominance, specialized players carve sustainable niches. Get Brendan on Blockchain’s stories in your inbox Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer.Subscribe What makes this entire ecosystem shift fascinating is how quickly traditional finance absorbed what was supposed to be disruptive technology. Spot Bitcoin ETFs solved the institutional access problem by providing compliant exposure through familiar investment vehicles. This flow diagram shows how different investor types can now access Bitcoin without direct crypto custody requirements. ETFs provided the compliant wrapper institutional investors needed, turning crypto from alternative asset to portfolio component. The regulatory environment signals this acceptance is permanent. Political leadership openly supporting crypto as strategic national infrastructure, combined with continued SEC evolution, suggests the framework will expand rather than contract. Ethereum ETFs, multi-crypto funds, and integration with traditional wealth management represent logical progressions. Institutional behavior confirms this maturation. Recent filings show mixed activity: some asset managers trimming Bitcoin ETF positions during Q1 2025 volatility while others made first-time allocations. This isn’t speculation; it’s portfolio management. Institutions treat crypto like any other asset class requiring risk assessment and allocation decisions. The infrastructure supporting this transformation continues solidifying. Custody solutions evolved from exchange wallets to institutional-grade security. Trading infrastructure handles billions in daily volume without the technical failures that plagued early crypto markets. Regulatory frameworks provide clarity for compliance officers nervous about digital assets. Market structure reflects this evolution. Price discovery happens across regulated exchanges with institutional participation rather than fragmented crypto-only platforms. Liquidity comes from diverse sources including algorithmic trading, institutional arbitrage, and retail participation through familiar brokerages. But here’s what I find most compelling: we’re witnessing the creation of parallel financial infrastructure rather than replacement of existing systems. Crypto didn’t disrupt traditional finance; it forced traditional finance to build crypto-compatible systems. Coinbase became the bridge between Bitcoin networks and institutional custody requirements. Robinhood built crypto trading that feels like stock trading. ETF providers wrapped crypto exposure in familiar investment vehicles. Each player solved specific friction points rather than demanding wholesale adoption of new paradigms. This infrastructure approach explains why Bitcoin ETF approval catalyzed such dramatic price movements. Bitcoin’s price acceleration correlates directly with ETF infrastructure milestones rather than speculative bubbles. The correlation between regulatory developments, ETF volume, and sustained price growth demonstrates institutional demand driving the market. Institutional money wasn’t waiting for crypto to mature; it was waiting for compliant access methods. Once those existed, allocation decisions followed standard portfolio logic rather than speculation. The winners in this transformation aren’t necessarily the platforms with the most users or the highest trading volumes. They’re the companies providing reliable infrastructure for an asset class that institutional investors can no longer ignore. Success metrics have shifted accordingly. Revenue stability matters more than growth rates. Regulatory compliance generates competitive advantages. Technical reliability determines institutional trust. These factors favor established players with resources to build proper infrastructure over startups promising disruption. Looking forward, the infrastructure is set. Regulatory frameworks continue evolving supportively. Institutional adoption follows predictable patterns based on risk tolerance and allocation models. The speculation phase is ending; the infrastructure utilization phase is beginning. The revolution isn’t in Bitcoin’s price reaching six figures. It’s in the infrastructure making crypto a standard component of diversified portfolios. The companies that built this infrastructure (and continue maintaining it) control the future of institutional crypto adoption. That’s where the real value gets created and captured.

2025-07-10T03:19:17,"Bears Lose $400M to Liquidations, Largest Since May, as BTC, ETH, SOL Spike Higher","A sharp rally in crypto majors over the past 12 hours triggered the largest wave of liquidations since May, wiping out more than $460 million in short positions. Bitcoin (BTC) surged past $111,000, ether (ETH) jumped nearly 7% to above $2,700, and Solana’s SOL climbed above $158, catching traders betting against the move completely offside. More than 114,000 traders were liquidated, with combined losses topping $527 million, according to data from Coinglass. Of that, $463 million came from short positions — or leveraged bets that the market would go lower — while only $64 million came from longs. The single largest liquidation was a $51.5 million short on HTX’s BTC-USDT pair. Liquidations occur when traders using leverage, or borrowing funds to amplify their positions, are unable to meet margin requirements as prices move against them. Exchanges forcibly close these positions to prevent further losses, often adding fuel to the move itself. In this case, as BTC and ETH pushed higher, waves of short liquidations may have created sudden price acceleration, forcing more traders to exit in a cascade. This reflexive dynamic makes liquidation data a useful trading signal. Sharp spikes in liquidations, especially from one side of the book, often indicate local tops or bottoms, depending on direction and timing. Some traders even position around it, betting on short squeezes or long flush-outs when the numbers start to skew. When combined with volume and price action, liquidation events often confirm the strength of a trend or signal its exhaustion. While Bitcoin remains up just 2% on the week, ETH and XRP are now both up more than 7%, suggesting the rally is being led by majors outside of BTC.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/10/bears-lose-400m-to-liquidations-largest-since-may-as-btc-eth-sol-spike-higher,"BTC|ETH|SOL|TRADING|MARKET","Markets|News",cryptocompare
2025-07-10T03:16:26,"Remixpoint Targets 3,000 BTC Following $215M Fundraising Round","Japanese energy consulting firm, Remixpoint, has announced that it has raised approximately 31.5 billion yen, worth around $215 million, through financing. All funds are allocated for the acquisition of Bitcoin. The company aims to hold 3,000 BTC in the near term. However, it warned that fluctuations in the crypto asset’s prices and its own stock price could affect the plan. Remixpoint Bets Big on Bitcoin Following the initial acquisition, additional purchases will be based on the average stock price over three consecutive trading days. In its disclosure, Remixpoint stated that after extensive internal discussions, it has become increasingly convinced of Bitcoin’s future potential. Although various opinions were expressed within the company, the board unanimously concluded that the move would boost corporate value from a risk-return perspective while expanding future strategic options. “We understand the difference between seizing opportunities and playing it safe, as well as the distinction between a challenge and recklessness. We kindly ask for your continued warm support.” The latest development comes just a day after the Japanese energy firm said that it will pay its President and CEO, Yoshihiko Takahashi, his entire executive compensation in Bitcoin. Following the move, it became the first listed company in the country to adopt this approach. The step is in line with Remixpoint’s goal of “shareholder-oriented management,” ensuring that management shares the same economic fate as shareholders, especially as its share price often moves in tandem with Bitcoin’s price. The decision follows shareholder feedback urging management to align more closely with investor interests. While insider trading restrictions make it difficult for executives to acquire company shares, paying the CEO in Bitcoin offers a practical alternative to share economic value with shareholders while supporting Remixpoint’s strategy of integrating crypto assets, energy, and Web initiatives. The announcement comes amid a broader trend in Japan of companies, including Gumi, Value Creation, Metaplanet, and SBC Medical, adding Bitcoin to their strategies and balance sheets. Semler’s Corporate Bitcoin Accumulation Race Outside Japan, corporate adoption of Bitcoin as a treasury asset continues to gain momentum. For instance, Nasdaq-listed healthcare tech firm Semler Scientific acquired 187 BTC for $20 million at $106,906 per bitcoin this week. The purchase was funded using proceeds from its at-the-market (ATM) stock program. With this latest addition, Semler now holds a total of 4,636 BTC. The stash is currently valued at around $502 million, against a total purchase cost of $430 million. This implies paper gains of approximately $72 million and places the company 15th among corporations with the largest BTC holdings.

2025-07-10T03:00:12,"The Senate Banking Committee held a heated hearing on crypto regulation","A high-stakes debate over the future of cryptocurrency regulation is playing out in Washington. On Wednesday, the Senate Banking Committee held a hearing that exposed deep partisan divisions on how to regulate the rapidly expanding digital asset market. Republican senators hailed a regulatory structure called “light-touch,” asserting that innovation must be protected and fostered. They stressed that government overreach must be avoided, but recognized the importance of ensuring that a clear and predictable legal framework was established to protect crypto businesses and investors. “Our job is to set clear, light-touch guardrails to protect investors, stop fraud, and allow responsible innovation to flourish,” said Senator Tim Scott, the committee’s Republican chair. He emphasized that the legislation must specify which tokens are securities and commodities — a source of confusion that has long impeded enforcement. The banker also stressed the importance of addressing the threat of illicit finance without smothering innovation. On the opposite end, Democratic senators demanded tighter guardrails and warned that the current proposals are too weak and pockmarked by loopholes. Democrats express concerns about loopholes and conflicts Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia sharply criticized the bill, saying it fails to address growing conflicts of interest among political leaders and lacks adequate consumer protections. He pointed to recent developments involving President Donald Trump and his family, noting that they have launched or endorsed meme coins and crypto tokens nearing listings on public exchanges. Warnock argued that political favoritism increasingly shapes the marketplace, where well-connected individuals benefit from largely unregulated activity. He added that while some lawmakers push for action on market structure, the current environment hardly reflects a fair or free market. Democratic senators also flagged a provision that allows companies to self-certify as “decentralized” and therefore avoid needing to register with either the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Critics say this would enable large companies to skirt regulatory oversight by declaring themselves decentralized even if their functioning is anything but. Timothy Massad, a former CFTC Chair who testified at the hearing, commented that the current legislative text would facilitate a dangerous transition of regulated activity from regulated to unregulated venues. “This broad carve-out for decentralized entities is a regulatory black hole,” he added. Massad recommended that legislators draw definitions more tightly and construct a framework encompassing centralized and decentralized systems, but that didn’t offer companies unjust loopholes to slip through. Republicans advance crypto legislation amid disputes Even under the tense stare-down, Republican senators showed no signs of blinking. Sens Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), and Tim Scott (R-SC) published a joint statement sharing their “market structure principles” for a crypto regulatory framework. These proposals would provide definitions for digital assets, allowing for a clear legal categorization of such assets and apportioning enforcement jurisdiction between the SEC and CFTC. Their method is similar to that of the CLARITY Act, a House-approved bill that advanced through committee in June. That bill proposes to define whether a digital asset is a commodity or a security according to how it is used, not just how it was initially sold — an idea that has drawn heavy support from the industry. Senator Hagerty was confident that there would be bipartisan cooperation down the road. He shrugged off the day’s tensions as routine friction in the legislative process. “I would not be dissuaded by what you just heard in that hearing,” he said, predicting that Democrats who once backed stablecoin legislation would eventually align on broader market structure issues. The House will also soon debate its digital asset legislation. If the two chambers approve compatible versions, the United States could inch closer to having a single, unified national crypto framework — a longtime ambition of digital asset enthusiasts as the technology becomes increasingly mainstream.

2025-07-10T02:15:49,"Asia Morning Briefing: Nvidia’s Rally to $4 Trillion Might Have Helped BTC, But Correlation Is Waning","Good Morning, Asia. Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Nvidia's ascent to a historic $4 trillion market cap , the first-ever company to achieve this milestone, might be exactly the catalyst bitcoin (BTC) needed to break out of its tightly coiled trading range and surge toward new all-time highs, addressing analysts' concerns that the crypto market lacked a clear driver. BTC is currently trading at $110,900, according to CoinDesk market data , after rallying during the U.S. trading hours to over $111,000 and briefly touching all-time high. Glassnode analysts had previously described Bitcoin’s recent market activity as quiet , characterized by declining on-chain transactions, minimal miner revenues, and suppressed fees. Rather than interpreting these factors as bearish indicators, Glassnode highlighted a mature market increasingly dominated by large-value institutional transactions and cautious long-term holders. All this being said, the correlation between Nvidia and BTC might be short-lived as data suggests its weakening. While the correlation between the GPU giant and BTC peaked above 0.80 during the AI-driven euphoria of early 2024, and the three-month average remains relatively strong at 0.69, the latest data shows a dip to around 0.36, indicating a possible decoupling as investor focus shifts. Still, Nvidia’s milestone seemed to serve as a potential trigger for BTC breakout from weeks of price inertia. However, it's possible that Nvidia's share prices might correct at some point, given its volatile nature. But this weakening correlation means that BTC price might remain resilient – when that day comes. Australia Begins Real-World CBDC Tests Australia’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) initiative, Project Acacia, has entered its next phase as the Reserve Bank of Australia names 24 industry participants selected to trial real-world applications of digital money in tokenized asset markets. Spearheaded by the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre, the project brings together major banks, fintechs, and infrastructure firms to trial programmable digital money in real-world financial workflows. The pilots will explore settlement across asset classes such as bonds, carbon credits, private markets, and trade receivables. Nineteen projects will involve live transactions, while five will remain at the proof-of-concept stage. ASIC has granted targeted regulatory relief to allow testing with real assets, continuing its approach of enabling responsible innovation in digital finance. While Australia is pushing ahead with further CBDC development, the Bank of Canada has shifted its focus away from developing a retail CBDC, amid mounting criticism that such a system could enable government surveillance by allowing authorities to monitor every transaction, unlike the anonymity offered by cash. Market Movements BTC: Bitcoin hovered near $109,000 as institutions defended key support levels amid light resistance at $110,000, showing resilience despite dormant wallet activity and regulatory uncertainty, while macro conditions such as a weakening dollar and steady rate cut odds bolstered corporate appetite for risk assets, according to the CoinDesk market insights bot. ETH: ETH closed a volatile 23-hour session up 2.8 percent, with strong institutional volume and resilience above $2,650 signaling continued bullish positioning amid market uncertainty. Gold: Gold prices extended losses for a second day, hovering near $3,285 as reduced July Fed rate cut bets, a strong U.S. dollar, and firm Treasury yields pressured the metal, though trade tariff concerns and upcoming FOMC minutes helped limit further downside . Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets opened mixed Thursday as investors weighed the Bank of Korea’s rate hold and U.S. President Trump’s move to impose a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports, citing unfair trade and retaliation over Bolsonaro’s prosecution, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 down 0.45%.

2025-07-10T02:06:00,"Top crypto price predictions: Pepe Coin, Stellar XLM, Zebec Network","The crypto market has embarked on a strong bullish trend this week, with Bitcoin and most altcoins being in the green. This bull run could continue as the US dollar index softens, Crypto Week nears, and Trump advocates for a 3% rate cut. This article provides a crypto price prediction of top altcoins like Pepe Coin (PEPE), Stellar Lumens (XLM), and Zebec Network (ZBCN). Pepe Coin price technical analysis Pepe chart | Source: TradingView The daily chart indicates that the Pepe Coin price has experienced a strong bull run over the past few days. It moved from a low of $0.000082 in July to the current $0.0000110. The rebound is largely due to the ongoing crypto market rally and bullish technical indicators. For example, the token remained above the ascending trendline that connects the lowest swings since March this year. Most importantly, the coin has formed a falling wedge pattern. This pattern is made up of two falling and converging trendlines, with the breakout happening when the two lines near their convergence. Pepe Coin price has moved slightly above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, meaning that a golden cross pattern may happen soon. The most likely scenario is that the Pepe token rises and hits the key resistance level at $0.00001616, which is approximately 50% above its current value. Zebec Network price forecast ZBCN price chart | Source: TradingView Meanwhile, Zebec Network price has bounced back this week, surging from a low of $0.0023 to $0.0036. This rally took place after the company’s leaders were invited to speak in the British parliament, where they discussed regulation. Zebec Network @Zebec_HQ · Follow 🇬🇧 Zebec Leadership to speak in the British Parliament – House of Lords on Regulation and Compliance on July 10.Zebec Network has been invited to present at the Palace of Westminster, addressing key industry topics from compliance to whistleblower policies, and advising on 9:55 PM · Jul 7, 2025 1.4K Reply Copy link Read 154 replies Zebec Network also presented its idea for a super application that combines payment and payroll services. These developments happened as the ecosystem followed the acquisition of Science Card, a British company with over 50,000 users. The daily chart shows that the ZBCN price bottomed at $0.00230 this week and then staged a strong comeback to the current $0.00368. ZBCN price has jumped above the 50-day and 100-day moving averages. Zebec has also jumped above the Major S/R pivot point of the Murrey Math Lines tool. Therefore, the most likely scenario is where it continues rising and reaches the strong pivot reverse point at $0.0045. A drop below the major S/R pivot point at $0.0030 will invalidate the bullish forecast. Stellar price technical analysis XLM price chart | Source: TradingView The Stellar Lumens price has jumped this week as the stablecoin market cap continues rising. XLM token bottomed at $0.2175, its lowest swing in April and June this year. It formed a double-bottom pattern whose neckline at $0.3331. The coin has moved above the descending trendline that connects the highest swings since February 2. XLM price moved above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average. The Relative Strength Index and the Stochastic Oscillator have continued rising this year. Therefore, the token will continue to rise as bulls target the next key resistance level at $0.3331, the neckline of the double bottom.

2025-07-10T02:00:34,"Bitcoin 30-Day Average Funding Rate Drops – Bullish Setup Takes Shape","Bitcoin continues to consolidate just below its all-time high of $112K, holding firmly above key support at $105K despite repeated bearish attempts to push the price lower. This tight trading range reflects market uncertainty, yet the structure favors bulls as long as support levels remain intact. Related Reading: Ethereum Turns Key Resistance Into Support – Momentum Builds For Range Breakout Meanwhile, macroeconomic conditions are evolving rapidly. The US Congress recently passed President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful” economic package ahead of the self-imposed July 4 deadline, signaling a new phase of fiscal stimulus marked by tax cuts and aggressive spending. Combined with strong job reports, these factors suggest inflation may soon accelerate — a trend that historically supports Bitcoin as a hedge against fiat devaluation. On the market sentiment side, funding rates provide a crucial clue. According to top analyst On-Chain Mind, the 30-day average of Bitcoin perpetual funding rates is currently very low. This reflects a lack of excessive greed and typically marks a favorable setup for bullish continuation. Historically, periods of low funding rates have preceded major upward moves, especially when paired with strong macro tailwinds. With economic pressure building and Bitcoin still in a bullish structure, the coming days could define the next major move for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Calm Before The Breakout: Bitcoin Gains Strength Above $107K Bitcoin is up more than 3% since the start of July, holding firmly above the $107,000 local low despite repeated resistance at the $110,000 level. This sustained strength signals underlying buyer support and growing momentum as BTC continues to consolidate just below all-time highs. The $110K resistance remains a critical ceiling — once breached, analysts expect a strong move into price discovery as bullish momentum builds. So far, the market has digested a wave of macroeconomic and geopolitical developments. Global trade dynamics — including rising tariffs, export restrictions, and deglobalization trends — continue to shape sentiment. Yet, compared to the sharp volatility seen earlier this year, both Bitcoin and US equities appear more resilient. This suggests that much of the uncertainty has already been priced in, reducing the downside risk for risk assets like BTC. A key technical factor reinforcing the bullish case is the low 30-day average of funding rates. This indicator reflects a neutral-to-cautiously optimistic market environment — a stark contrast to overheated bullish phases that often precede corrections. Calm periods like this often set the stage for explosive moves, particularly when supply squeezes and strong demand meet a macro environment ripe for risk-taking. With BTC coiling tightly and sentiment balanced, a breakout could be imminent. Related Reading: ERC-20 Stablecoin Supply Hits All-Time High At $121B – Liquidity On The Rise BTC Holds Steady as Bulls Eye $109,300 Breakout The 4-hour chart shows Bitcoin (BTC) consolidating within a tight range, holding above the key support at $107,000 and testing resistance around $109,300. This price level has consistently acted as a local ceiling, with several failed breakout attempts in late June and early July. However, the bulls continue to defend higher lows, signaling strength and setting the stage for a potential breakout. The 50, 100, and 200 simple moving averages (SMAs) are stacked close together and gradually trending upward, suggesting the consolidation phase could soon transition into a more directional move. Volume remains low, which often precedes a volatility spike, especially near key resistance levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Risks Downside If Resistance Holds: $2,700 Level Is Critical The $103,600 support remains the crucial line in the sand for bulls. A breakdown below that level would invalidate the short-term bullish structure and likely lead to a deeper retrace.

The objection, submitted to a U.S. bankruptcy court on Tuesday, comes from Weiwei Ji, a Chinese passport holder currently living in Singapore. Ji stated that despite their current residence, they’ve been classified as a Chinese creditor due to their nationality. According to the filing, Ji represents a group of more than 300 Chinese creditors with substantial claims. FTX Repayment Restrictions Under Fire FTX’s motion, filed on July 2 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware, seeks to temporarily halt repayments to creditors in 49 jurisdictions. These include countries like China, Russia, Zimbabwe, and Moldova, where laws around cryptocurrency are either ambiguous or restrictive. The estate argues that making payments to residents in these areas could potentially result in criminal penalties, financial fines, or personal liability for those administering the repayments. Moldova, in particular, was cited as a risk example, where even auxiliary services involving virtual assets are deemed criminal offenses. Claimants Argue Distribution Should Proceed In the objection, Ji argued that digital assets are considered personal property in China, and U.S. dollar settlements are a recognized legal form of payment. This, Ji claims, nullifies the rationale for withholding distributions. “My family holds four KYC-verified accounts with aggregate claims exceeding $15 million USD,” Ji wrote. “We have fully complied with every procedural requirement under the Plan. The proposed motion now jeopardizes our right to distribution in an arbitrary and inequitable manner.” Wider Implications for Creditors Worldwide The motion estimates that around 5% of the total value of approved claims belongs to residents in restricted regions. The estate’s filing seeks to mitigate potential legal complications arising from international payouts. However, creditors like Ji argue that the motion imposes unfair barriers and contradicts the spirit of the agreed-upon bankruptcy plan. The objection brings attention to the complexities of cross-border bankruptcy proceedings involving digital assets. FTX Repayments Already Underway FTX began issuing repayments on February 18, prioritizing convenience class claimants. These initial payments are based on the value of digital assets at the time of the company’s collapse in November 2022—a decision that has been criticized by some creditors. While the estate continues to navigate legal and logistical hurdles, the backlash from international creditors could pose new challenges in the already controversial repayment process.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/chinese-creditors-challenge-ftx-estates-payout-restrictions/,"ASIA|REGULATION|BTC","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare

BTC is up ~15% year to date and is now ~2% below its record high from May 2025. Ether's closing price jumped 8% from last week to a four-week high. By Jennifer Nash This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ether ( ETH-USD ). While both are considered to be high-risk when it comes to investing, the two have foundational differences that investors should know . We've also included XRP ( XRP-USD ), as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia , a cryptocurrency is ""a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets."" Bitcoin Bitcoin was the world's first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide to a mainstream financial asset. It is often considered volatile, as seen in our first chart, but one can argue that it is also resilient . Bitcoin's closing price was up slightly from the previous week, hovering around $109,000. BTC is up ~15% year to date and is now ~2% below its record high from May 2025. Ether Ether is a cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and was launched in July 2015. It has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three discussed in this article. Ether's closing price jumped 8% from last week to a four-week high. However, ETH is still down ~22% year to date and is ~46% below its record high from November 2021. XRP XRP, which is owned by Ripple, was launched in 2012 and was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. Bitcoin vs. Ether vs. XRP An index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. The chart tells us which cryptocurrency's price has changed the most since November 9, 2017. At one point or another, all three have been at the top. At the time of writing, bitcoin is in the lead. On January 10th, 2024, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs from a range of issuers, such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ), iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ), ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Coinshares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ( BRRR ). Here are some of the quick takeaways from the spot bitcoin ETF launch. On July 23rd, 2024, a handful of spot ether ETFs launched from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ), Franklin Ethereum ETF ( EZET ), Bitwise Ethereum ETF ( ETHW ), iShares Ethereum Trust ( ETHA ), Fidelity Ethereum ETF ( FETH ).

2025-07-10T00:30:32,"Bitcoin Moving With Stocks, But Ethereum’s Correlation Is Fading","Bitcoin has been showing notable correlation to the stock equities recently, but data shows Ethereum is charting a more independent path. Bitcoin & Ethereum Showing Different Degrees Of Correlation To Other Assets In a post on X, the institutional DeFi solutions provider Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) has talked about how the latest Correlation Matrix has looked between the two largest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, and traditional markets. The “Correlation Matrix” here refers to an indicator that tells us how closely tied together the prices of two given assets currently are. When the value of this metric is positive, it means the assets are reacting to moves in each other by moving in the same direction to some degree. The closer the metric is to 1, the stronger the relationship. Related Reading: Bitcoin & Stablecoin Reserves Diverge On Binance: Liquidity Explosion Brewing? On the other hand, the indicator being under the zero mark implies there is a negative correlation between the two prices. That is, they are moving in opposite directions. For this side of the scale, the extreme point is -1. Naturally, the Correlation Matrix showing a value exactly equal to zero suggests there is no correlation whatsoever between the assets. In statistics, the two variables are said to be ‘independent’ in this case. Now, here is the table shared by Sentora that shows how the Correlation Matrix of Bitcoin and Ethereum stands with respect to some traditional markets: As is visible above, the index that Bitcoin and Ethereum have the strongest positive correlation to is DAX. That said, the Correlation Matrix stands at 0.46 for ETH, meaning that while some correlation does exist, it’s not too intense. This isn’t the case for Bitcoin, which has the indicator sitting at 0.85, indicating its price is pretty in tandem with DAX. Likewise, BTC has a notable correlation to other stock market indices, with a metric value of 0.7, 0.68, and 0.69 for the Russel 2000, S&P 500, and Dow Jones Industrial Average, respectively. In contrast, Ethereum is almost fully independent from these indices, with the indicator standing quite close to zero for each of them. For US Dollar Index and VIX Index, the last two markets listed in the table, the Correlation Matrix is inside the negative zone for Bitcoin. This means that the digital asset has actively been moving against these indices. Related Reading: Ethereum ETF Inflows Hit 8-Week Streak—Institutions Still Buying “Right now, the spotlight is on the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY): if geopolitical and macro tensions drag the dollar lower, that backdrop could create room for another leg higher in BTC,” notes the analytics firm. Just like with the stocks, Ethereum is displaying little correlation to DXY and VIX, further reinforcing that the cryptocurrency has been following a trajectory of its own recently.

2025-07-10T00:20:49,"Bitcoin’s Triumphant Surge: Historic 150 Million Won Milestone Unleashed in Korea","The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with monumental news from the East! Bitcoin’s price has once again defied expectations, breaching the significant 150 million won (KRW) mark on South Korea’s leading exchange, Upbit. This isn’t just a number; it’s a powerful statement about Bitcoin’s enduring strength, the robust appetite of the Korean crypto market , and the increasing mainstream acceptance of digital assets . For many, this milestone represents not just financial gain, but a validation of the decentralized future that blockchain technology promises. Let’s dive deep into what this historic achievement means for investors, the market, and the broader financial landscape. What Does a Bitcoin Price of 150 Million Won Mean for Korea? The psychological impact of Bitcoin surpassing 150 million won cannot be overstated, particularly within the highly active South Korean investment community. This isn’t merely a local record; it signifies a new peak in a market known for its intense trading volumes and unique dynamics. When Bitcoin hits such a formidable figure, it triggers a ripple effect: Investor Confidence Boost: Existing holders see their portfolios swell, reinforcing their belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. New Investor Influx: The headline-grabbing number attracts new retail investors, eager not to miss out on what appears to be a parabolic ascent. This FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) often fuels further price increases. Increased Market Liquidity: Higher prices and renewed interest typically lead to more trading activity, enhancing market depth and liquidity on platforms like Upbit. Validation for Digital Assets: For a country that has seen both booms and busts in crypto, reaching this new high solidifies Bitcoin’s position as a legitimate, albeit volatile, investment vehicle. It moves beyond speculative asset to a recognized store of value for many. This milestone also highlights the ‘Kimchi Premium’ phenomenon, where Bitcoin often trades at a higher price on South Korean exchanges compared to global averages. This premium reflects the strong domestic demand and capital controls, making the 150 million won mark even more impressive within its local context. Unpacking the Unique Dynamics of the Korean Crypto Market South Korea stands out as one of the most vibrant and influential Korean crypto markets globally. Its distinct characteristics play a crucial role in Bitcoin’s price movements and the overall adoption of digital assets : High Retail Participation: A significant portion of the Korean population, particularly younger demographics, actively participates in cryptocurrency trading. This grassroots interest drives considerable market activity. Technologically Savvy Population: South Korea’s advanced technological infrastructure and high internet penetration make it fertile ground for digital innovations like cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Landscape: The Korean government has been proactive in establishing regulations for the crypto sector, aiming to balance innovation with investor protection. While strict at times, this regulatory clarity has also lent a degree of legitimacy to the market. The ‘Kimchi Premium’ Explained: This persistent phenomenon, where cryptocurrencies trade at a premium in Korea compared to international markets, is a testament to strong domestic demand and limited arbitrage opportunities due to capital controls. When Bitcoin reaches 150 million won in Korea, it often means it’s trading significantly higher than its USD equivalent elsewhere. Understanding these unique dynamics is key to appreciating the full impact of Bitcoin’s recent surge. The market’s maturity and investor sophistication contribute to its resilience and rapid response to global trends. The Role of Upbit Exchange in Bitcoin’s Korean Triumph No discussion of Bitcoin’s performance in Korea is complete without acknowledging the pivotal role of the Upbit exchange . As the largest cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea by trading volume, Upbit is the primary gateway for millions of Korean investors to access the crypto market. Its dominance means that its price reflects the collective sentiment and trading activity of a significant portion of the nation’s crypto enthusiasts. Upbit offers a robust trading platform, a wide array of digital assets, and high liquidity, making it the preferred choice for both seasoned traders and newcomers. The platform’s ability to handle massive trading volumes efficiently is crucial during periods of rapid price appreciation, like Bitcoin’s climb to 150 million won . The seamless execution of trades on Upbit directly contributes to the market’s efficiency and investor confidence. Key Features of Upbit that Contribute to Market Health: Feature Impact on Market High Liquidity Ensures smooth trading, minimizes price slippage, especially during volatile periods. Wide Range of Assets Attracts diverse investors, offers more trading opportunities beyond Bitcoin. Strong Security Measures Builds trust among users, essential for protecting large sums of digital assets . User-Friendly Interface Lowers the barrier to entry for new investors, fostering broader adoption. The activity on the Upbit exchange is a powerful barometer for the health and direction of the entire Korean crypto market . When Bitcoin reaches new highs on Upbit, it’s a clear signal of strong domestic demand. Beyond Bitcoin: The Broader Impact on Digital Assets in Korea While Bitcoin often captures the headlines, its monumental surge to 150 million won has a significant ripple effect across the entire spectrum of digital assets . Historically, Bitcoin’s strong performance tends to pull the rest of the altcoin market higher, a phenomenon often referred to as ‘altcoin season’ or ‘trickle-down effect’. For the Korean market, this means: Increased Altcoin Interest: As Bitcoin’s price becomes less accessible for some new investors, or as existing investors seek higher potential returns, attention often shifts to other cryptocurrencies. Growth in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and NFTs: The renewed interest in the broader crypto space encourages exploration of innovative sectors like DeFi, which offers decentralized financial services, and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), which represent digital ownership. Innovation and Development: A thriving market provides incentives for developers and entrepreneurs to build new blockchain projects and applications, further solidifying Korea’s position as a hub for crypto innovation. Regulatory Scrutiny and Adaptation: With increased market activity and value, regulators may also intensify their focus on consumer protection and market integrity, leading to a more mature and regulated environment for all digital assets . The current bullish sentiment, largely driven by Bitcoin’s impressive Bitcoin price action, is fostering an environment where a wider array of blockchain-based projects can gain traction and adoption within the Korean crypto market . Navigating the Momentum: Challenges and Actionable Insights for Investors While the surge past 150 million won is cause for celebration, it’s crucial for investors to approach the market with a balanced perspective. The cryptocurrency market, by its very nature, is highly volatile. What goes up can also come down, sometimes dramatically. Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before investing in any digital assets , thoroughly research the project, its technology, team, and market cap. Don’t rely solely on hype. Understand Risk Tolerance: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Bitcoin’s journey to 150 million won has been filled with significant corrections. Diversification: While Bitcoin is a strong performer, consider diversifying your portfolio across different cryptocurrencies or even traditional assets to mitigate risk. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Decide if you are investing for short-term gains or long-term growth. Different strategies apply to each. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of global macroeconomic factors, regulatory changes, and technological developments that can impact the Bitcoin price and the broader Korean crypto market . For those considering entering the market or expanding their portfolios on the Upbit exchange , this period of high momentum offers both opportunities and heightened risks. Prudent decision-making and a clear strategy are paramount. The Road Ahead: What’s Next for Bitcoin and the Korean Market? The question on everyone’s mind is, “What’s next?” While no one can predict the future with certainty, several factors could influence Bitcoin’s trajectory beyond 150 million won and the overall health of the Korean crypto market : Global Macroeconomic Conditions: Inflation rates, interest rate decisions by central banks, and geopolitical events can all impact investor appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. Institutional Adoption: Continued influx of institutional money through spot ETFs and corporate treasury allocations could provide significant buying pressure, pushing the Bitcoin price even higher. Technological Developments: Upgrades to the Bitcoin network or the broader blockchain ecosystem could enhance utility and drive demand for digital assets . Regulatory Clarity: Further clear and supportive regulations in major economies, including South Korea, could provide more confidence for both retail and institutional investors. Halving Cycles: Bitcoin’s programmatic supply reduction events (halvings) have historically preceded significant bull runs. The recent halving’s impact is still unfolding. The journey of Bitcoin has always been marked by volatility, but its resilience and growing acceptance are undeniable. The Korean crypto market , with its unique characteristics and enthusiastic participant base, will undoubtedly continue to play a crucial role in this global narrative. Conclusion: A New Era for Bitcoin in Korea Bitcoin’s ascent past the 150 million won mark on the Upbit exchange is more than just a fleeting headline; it’s a testament to the cryptocurrency’s growing maturity, its unwavering appeal, and the dynamic strength of the Korean crypto market . This historic achievement solidifies Bitcoin’s position as a premier digital asset and opens new discussions about its role in the global financial system. While the path ahead may be volatile, this milestone serves as a powerful reminder of the transformative potential of decentralized finance. It underscores the importance of staying informed, managing risk, and embracing the evolving landscape of digital currencies.

2025-07-10T00:10:52,"Spot Bitcoin ETF: SEC’s Crucial Acknowledgment Ignites Bitwise ETF Hopes","The world of digital assets is constantly evolving, and a recent development from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has sent ripples of anticipation across the crypto community. The SEC’s acknowledgment of an amendment from Bitwise concerning physical redemptions for its proposed Spot Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum ETFs is more than just bureaucratic paperwork; it’s a crucial signal that could shape the future of institutional crypto adoption. This move brings us closer to a new era where mainstream investors can access digital assets with greater ease and regulatory clarity. What Does it Mean When the SEC Acknowledges an Amendment? When the SEC acknowledges an amendment, it signifies that the regulatory body has officially received and begun reviewing updated filings from an applicant. In this case, Bitwise submitted an amendment detailing how its proposed spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs would handle ‘physical redemptions.’ This isn’t an approval, but it’s a necessary procedural step that indicates the application is still active and being considered. For the crypto market, every such acknowledgment is scrutinized for hints about the SEC’s evolving stance on digital asset products, especially after a period of significant regulatory caution. Historically, the SEC has been hesitant to approve spot crypto ETFs, citing concerns around market manipulation, investor protection, and the nascent nature of the underlying assets. However, the landscape has been shifting, particularly following landmark court decisions and increased institutional interest. Bitwise, a prominent player in the crypto investment space, has been at the forefront of pushing for these products, continually refining their applications to meet regulatory expectations. This latest amendment suggests a proactive approach by Bitwise to address potential SEC concerns, particularly around the mechanics of ETF operations. The Game-Changer: Understanding Physical Redemptions One of the most significant aspects of Bitwise’s amendment is its focus on Physical Redemptions . To understand why this is a potential game-changer, let’s compare it with the more common ‘cash redemption’ model: Cash Redemption Model: In this model, when an investor wants to redeem their ETF shares, the issuer sells the underlying assets (e.g., Bitcoin) in the open market and gives the investor cash. This method can introduce tax complexities for the issuer and potentially impact the underlying asset’s price through selling pressure. Physical Redemption Model: Here, when an investor redeems ETF shares, they receive the actual underlying asset (e.g., Bitcoin or Ethereum) directly, rather than cash. This is often preferred by institutional investors and large market makers because it allows for more efficient arbitrage opportunities, potentially leading to tighter tracking between the ETF’s price and the underlying asset’s price. It also avoids certain tax events for the issuer that arise from selling assets. For the SEC, allowing physical redemptions could be seen as a step towards greater integration of crypto assets into traditional financial frameworks, albeit with careful oversight. It addresses concerns about how the ETF interacts with the spot market and could provide a more direct, transparent link to the underlying digital assets. This mechanism is crucial for market makers to efficiently create and redeem ETF shares, ensuring the ETF trades close to its net asset value (NAV) and maintaining market integrity. Cash vs. Physical Redemption in ETFs Feature Cash Redemption Physical Redemption Underlying Asset Exchange Issuer sells assets for cash; investor receives cash. Issuer directly transfers assets; investor receives assets. Tax Implications (for issuer) Potential capital gains/losses on asset sales. Generally no direct tax event on asset transfer. Arbitrage Efficiency Less direct, potential for slight tracking errors. More direct, better for precise arbitrage. Market Impact Can create selling pressure on underlying asset. Direct transfer, less direct market impact from redemption. Institutional Preference Less preferred for large-scale operations. Often preferred for operational efficiency. The Road Paved for a Spot Bitcoin ETF The journey towards a fully approved Spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. has been long and arduous, marked by numerous rejections and delays. However, 2024 has witnessed a breakthrough with the approval of several spot Bitcoin ETFs, transforming how investors can gain exposure to the world’s largest cryptocurrency. These approvals have been hailed as a watershed moment, bringing Bitcoin into the mainstream financial ecosystem and attracting significant institutional capital. The SEC’s current acknowledgment of Bitwise’s amendment builds on this momentum, signaling continued refinement and potential expansion of the existing framework. The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs has democratized access to Bitcoin, allowing investors to trade it through traditional brokerage accounts without the complexities of direct crypto ownership, such as setting up wallets or managing private keys. This has opened the floodgates for new capital, providing a regulated, accessible, and often more cost-effective way to invest in Bitcoin. The success of these initial products has likely encouraged further regulatory review and a deeper understanding of the mechanisms required for their smooth operation, including the nuanced details of redemption processes. What About the Spot Ethereum ETF? While Bitcoin has garnered much of the spotlight, the prospect of a Spot Ethereum ETF is also gaining significant traction. Ethereum, with its robust ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and DeFi, represents another critical pillar of the crypto economy. Many analysts believe that the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs sets a precedent for Ethereum, as the underlying regulatory and market dynamics share many similarities. However, there are unique considerations for Ethereum, particularly concerning its transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and its classification by the SEC. Bitwise’s amendment for both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs suggests a comprehensive strategy to address regulatory concerns for both major cryptocurrencies. The path for an Ethereum ETF might be slightly different due to its distinct features and ongoing regulatory discussions about whether ETH should be classified as a security or a commodity. Nevertheless, the SEC’s engagement with Bitwise’s Ethereum ETF amendment indicates that discussions are progressing, and the possibility of an ETH ETF joining its BTC counterpart in the near future remains high, offering investors diversified exposure to the top two digital assets. Bitwise ETFs: Pioneering the Next Wave of Crypto Investment Bitwise ETFs have consistently been at the forefront of bringing crypto assets into regulated financial products. From their early efforts in launching crypto index funds to their persistent pursuit of spot ETFs, Bitwise has demonstrated a commitment to bridging the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset space. Their strategic filings and amendments, like the one recently acknowledged by the SEC, highlight their dedication to meeting stringent regulatory requirements and innovating within the evolving crypto landscape. Bitwise’s proactive approach in proposing physical redemptions underscores their understanding of institutional needs and market efficiency. By addressing these intricate operational details, they aim to create ETF products that are not only compliant but also highly attractive to a broad range of investors, from retail participants seeking easy access to sophisticated institutional players looking for efficient arbitrage mechanisms. Their ongoing efforts are crucial in shaping the regulatory dialogue and setting benchmarks for future crypto-backed financial products. The Road Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities While the SEC’s acknowledgment is a positive step, the road to full approval for all aspects of these ETFs, especially those involving physical redemptions, still presents challenges. Regulatory scrutiny remains high, and the SEC will likely demand robust frameworks for custody, valuation, and market surveillance to protect investors. Furthermore, the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies will continue to be a factor for both regulators and investors to consider. However, the opportunities are immense. The approval of more sophisticated ETF structures, such as those with physical redemption capabilities, could further legitimize digital assets as an asset class, attracting even more capital and fostering greater market liquidity. It could also spur innovation in related financial services and products, cementing cryptocurrencies’ place in the global financial system. For investors, it means more options, greater flexibility, and potentially lower costs for gaining exposure to this dynamic asset class. Conclusion: A Step Towards Maturation The U.S. SEC’s acknowledgment of Bitwise’s amendment for physical redemptions in its proposed spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs marks another significant milestone in the journey of digital assets into mainstream finance. While not an outright approval, it signals continued engagement and a deeper dive into the operational mechanics that are crucial for robust, regulated ETF products. The focus on physical redemptions highlights a move towards greater efficiency and alignment with institutional preferences, potentially paving the way for more sophisticated and attractive investment vehicles. This development underscores the growing maturity of the cryptocurrency market and the persistent efforts of firms like Bitwise to innovate within regulatory boundaries. As the dialogue between innovators and regulators continues, the prospect of more accessible and diverse crypto investment products becomes increasingly real, promising a future where digital assets play an even more integral role in global portfolios. Keep a close watch on these developments, as they are shaping the financial landscape of tomorrow.

2025-07-10T00:09:00,"Crypto rally: Here’s why Bitcoin and altcoins are going up today","A crypto rally is underway, with Bitcoin and most altcoins experiencing price increases this week. Bitcoin jumped to a record high of slightly below $112,000, while the market capitalization has soared to $3.47 trillion. This article explains why Bitcoin and altcoins are going up. Rising fear and greed index The primary reason for the crypto rally is the rising risk-on sentiment in financial markets. The CNN Money Fear and Greed Index has jumped to the extreme greed zone of 75. Its top sub-indices, like the stock price strength and breadth, put and call options, and junk bond demand have all moved to the extreme greed zone this week. This trend also explains why the stock market surged, with NVIDIA reaching a $4 trillion market capitalization for the first time. The Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq 100 indices rose by over 0.50% on Wednesday. Bitcoin bullish patterns The other main reason why the crypto rally is happening is that Bitcoin has formed two unique patterns, pointing to more gains, potentially to nearly $150,000. Historically, a Bitcoin surge leads to more upside among other altcoins. The chart below shows that Bitcoin formed a cup-and-handle pattern, which consists of a rounded bottom and a period of consolidation. It has been forming the handle section in the past month. This handle is part of the bullish flag pattern. Therefore, by measuring the cup’s depth and the height of the flag, one can estimate that the Bitcoin price will jump to nearly $150,000 later this year. Bitcoin price chart | Source: TradingView Crypto rally is happening because of the falling US dollar index The other tailwind driving the crypto rally is the falling US dollar index (DXY), which has moved from the year-to-date high of $110,000 to the current $97. The dollar has plunged against most currencies as investors question its role as a safe-haven asset after Trump’s unilateral tariffs. It has also dropped as traders anticipate the upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate cut. It also fell after Moody’s downgraded the US credit rating , warning of the ongoing uncontrolled spending. A good example of this spending is the recently passed Big, Beautiful Bill , which adds over $4 trillion in deficits in the next few years. The falling US dollar is a catalyst for assets dominated by the currency like stocks, crypto, and commodities. Upcoming Crypto Week The other reason why Bitcoin and altcoins are going up is the upcoming Crypto Week . Republicans in Congress hope to pass three crypto-related bills next week. The first bill is the GENIUS Act , which seeks to provide clarity in the stablecoin market. They will also consider the CLARITY Act, which separates the role of the SEC and the CFTC in crypto regulations. Congress will also consider a bill that will ban central bank digital currencies (CBCs) in the United States. Politicians worry that these digital currencies will lead to government surveillance. Bitcoin and altcoins are also rising as investors predict the end of the ongoing trade war. The theory is that Trump’s recent escalation is intended to pressure these countries into reaching agreements.

2025-07-10T00:00:36,"Here’s The Minimum XRP Holdings You Need To Unlock Millionaire Status","In a recent episode of The Good Evening Crypto show , analysts Abdullah “Abs” Nassif and Johnny examined the potential for XRP investors to achieve millionaire status over the next 12 to 24 months. Their conversation focused on current market conditions, upcoming regulatory shifts, and projected price trajectories for XRP. Based on their analysis, they outlined how much XRP one might need to accumulate in anticipation of a significant price increase. Regulatory Catalysts and Market Shifts Nassif emphasized that upcoming legislative developments could serve as key triggers for an XRP price surge. He referenced Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s upcoming appearance before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, as well as the House of Representatives’ scheduled review of the Crypto Clarity Act. These events, according to him, signal growing political and financial sector engagement with digital assets, which could influence investor sentiment and drive institutional interest. He also drew attention to data from the XRP Rich List . Currently, holding 2,500 XRP places an investor among the top 10% of all XRP wallets globally, while reaching the top 1% requires ownership of approximately 51,300 tokens. Nassif stated that most investors may not realize how relatively small holdings can position them in the upper tier of XRP ownership. He further argued that XRP does not need to outperform the entire crypto market, but simply needs to follow a growth trajectory similar to Bitcoin’s historical rise. Projections: How Much XRP to Become a Millionaire Johnny broke down the process of reaching $1 million in XRP holdings by introducing three potential market scenarios, divided between a speculative phase and a utility-driven phase. He believes the speculative phase could be activated by regulatory clarity, especially the passage of the Crypto Clarity Act. If XRP reaches $10 to $12 within the next two years, an investor would need to hold around 100,000 XRP to hit the $1 million mark. In a scenario where XRP climbs to $54, a holding of only 18,000 XRP would be sufficient. At a projected price of $25 per token, owning 40,000 XRP would bring an investor close to $1 million. These projections suggest that investors would need to accumulate between 18,000 and 100,000 XRP, depending on the extent of market momentum post-regulation. At current prices, this translates to an investment of approximately $41,760 to $232,000. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Rising Barriers to Entry Nassif pointed out that the cost of entering elite XRP ownership levels has risen significantly over the past year. For example, in late 2024, 2,500 XRP could be acquired for roughly $500, whereas that same amount now exceeds $5,000. He warned that this trend is likely to continue as more institutional players enter the market and absorb available supply. He estimated that securing a position in the top 1% of XRP wallets today would require an investment of around $100,000. If XRP were to reach $50 in the future, that holding would be valued at approximately $5 million. Nassif added that owning 25,000 XRP may be sufficient to reach the $1 million threshold, especially given the projected direction of the digital asset sector. In comparing XRP with Bitcoin , Nassif explained that Bitcoin would require a $2 trillion increase in market capitalization to double in value, whereas XRP could achieve similar growth with just $130 billion in new market cap. This, he argued, reflects XRP’s relatively higher potential for return on investment. Johnny advised investors not to delay action. He believes that XRP’s current pricing may not last long, particularly if regulation accelerates market growth. His sentiments are similar to views shared by other analysts like Edoardo Farina, who have repeatedly stressed the narrowing window for affordable entry into XRP. Ultimately, how much XRP an investor needs depends on the level of risk they’re willing to take and their expectations for the market. While projections vary, the consensus remains that early positioning could offer considerable upside. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.
