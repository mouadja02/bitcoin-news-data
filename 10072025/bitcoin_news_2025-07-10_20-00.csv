The explosive move comes after President Trump declared on Truth Social that crypto is going “ through the roof ,” triggering massive buying pressure across digital asset markets. Trump’s social media post highlighted record highs across tech stocks, industrial stocks, and the NASDAQ, while specifically calling out cryptocurrency’s stellar performance. Source: Ash Crypto on X The president emphasized that NVIDIA has gained 47% since Trump tariffs were announced, while urging the Federal Reserve to “ rapidly lower rates ” to reflect the economy’s strength.

Fueling this price increase is growing demand for Bitcoin ETFs, a positive macro environment, and expanding corporate BTC treasury holdings. Both retail traders and institutions are bullish as the U.S. environment shifts toward a more crypto-friendly stance. At the same time, a falling dollar has prompted many institutions to look for safe-haven assets. You might also like: Are Bitcoin treasury companies a new bubble akin to the ICO boom?

The company revealed it will now focus on the Solana blockchain and start buying the Solana native token (SOL). To support this move, it plans to raise between $200 million and $300 million. The decision is part of the company’s broader effort to grow its presence in the crypto industry and bring more value to its shareholders. BIT Mining to Fully Switch to SOL and Hodl for the Long Term BIT Mining is starting a new chapter as it shifts entirely to the Solana blockchain. Right now, it is the 17th biggest public Bitcoin mining company by market value. As part of this change, BIT Mining will turn all its current crypto into SOL. The company also plans to hold these tokens for a long time instead of selling them. This move aligns with a growing trend among public companies to hold digital assets on their balance sheets as a long-term investment. In addition to holding SOL, BIT Mining will take on a technical role in the Solana ecosystem. It plans to operate validator nodes, which are essential for keeping the network decentralized and secure. By doing so, the company expects to earn rewards directly on the blockchain through Solana’s staking system. Strong Belief in Solana Blockchain’s Future BIT Mining’s leaders say this new path is needed in the fast-changing crypto world. They believe their skills in hardware and mining make them ready to help the Solana network and grow their business. The company hopes this shift will bring faster innovation, improved blockchain connections, and greater value for its investors. Currently, the firm focuses on self-mining, developing mining machines, and providing hosting services. It also uses advanced chips to mine coins like Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Ethereum Classic. Meanwhile, BIT Mining is not the only company embracing other crypto assets beyond Bitcoin. Other mining firms, including BitMine and Bit Digital, are also adopting assets like Ethereum . BIT Mining Begins A Fresh Start After Legal Challenges BIT Mining’s new focus comes after the company settled a legal case with U.S. regulators . In November, it agreed to pay a $10 million penalty to resolve investigations related to its former business under the name 500.com. The case involved alleged bribes to Japanese government officials. At the time, the company was based in Shenzhen, China, and operated an online sports lottery platform. Since then, the company has transformed its focus. In April 2021, it rebranded from 500.com to BIT Mining and began trading under the ticker BTCM. This latest move into the Solana ecosystem is seen as another step in the company’s effort to redefine its mission and build a stronger position in the blockchain industry.

The poll shows 26% of Millennials and 30% of Gen Z respondents expect to receive an inheritance in the so-called “great wealth transfer.” Of the Millennial respondents expecting to receive inheritances, 33% said the gifts were “highly critical” and that they won’t achieve long-term financial security or be able to retire comfortably without them, compared to 28% for Gen Z. Additionally, another 36% of Millennials and 35% of Gen Z respondents rated their inheritances as “critical,” noting that they may not be able to realize long-term financial security without them. Northwestern Mutual notes that respondents from all generations demonstrated increased expectations for leaving an inheritance compared to the previous survey, while their expectations for receiving an inheritance fell. “As such, the gap between what Gen Z and Millennials say they expect in the way of an inheritance versus what their parents are actually planning to leave behind is narrowing. Notably, four in ten (39%) Gen Z adults say they plan to leave an inheritance or financial gift behind – more than any other generation.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-10T16:54:56,"Axelar Bridge Unlocks New Horizons for XRP Utility","Interoperability continues to take shape as a critical component in blockchain infrastructure, and XRP has now taken a notable step forward in this direction. A recent post from XRPL validator Vet (@Vet_X0) revealed that approximately 124,000 XRP is currently bridged via Axelar’s interoperability network. This development marks a significant moment in XRP’s integration with broader blockchain ecosystems. Axelar’s platform is designed to connect dozens of independent blockchains through a decentralized network of validators and cross-chain gateways. This enables seamless token transfers and contract calls across otherwise isolated ecosystems. This partnership comes shortly after the announcement of an integration with Wormhole to boost interoperability. The involvement of XRP on these networks suggests a growing appetite for extending its relevance beyond the confines of the XRP Ledger (XRPL). ~124,000 XRP is currently bridged via Axelar interoperability solution. pic.twitter.com/BkQE9aJAHS — Vet (@Vet_X0) July 9, 2025 Expanding XRP’s Functional Reach The Axelar bridge was launched same time as the XRPL Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Sidechain , ushering in a new era of interoperability for XRP. By bridging XRP to Axelar, holders and developers gain access to a wide array of decentralized applications (dApps) and services across more than 60 supported blockchains. These include popular platforms within the EVM ecosystem, Cosmos-based chains, and even Bitcoin Layer 2 networks. This expanded access opens up utility that XRP previously lacked in decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, and smart contract environments not natively compatible with the XRPL. 124,476 XRP have been bridged through Axelar, and prominent community members expect this figure to rise. This integration has been in the works since 2024 . For developers building with XRP, this bridge enables the integration of cross-chain functionality directly into applications without resorting to centralized exchanges or unreliable manual bridging methods. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Improving Liquidity And On-chain Programmability XRP’s interoperability with Axelar also has implications for the distribution of liquidity. Once bridged, XRP can be deployed into liquidity pools, lending protocols, or used as collateral across different ecosystems. This move directly contributes to deepening market liquidity and attracting new user segments that traditionally operate outside of the XRPL. Axelar’s integration enables XRP to be used in conjunction with programmable smart contracts via the Axelar Virtual Machine (AVM). That means developers can write logic that includes XRP as an asset within multi-chain workflows, something not previously feasible without compromising decentralization or requiring wrapped token models managed by centralized custodians. XRP now has full web3 interoperability , and as it begins to interface more directly with ecosystems outside its native ledger, its adoption and relevance within the crypto space will increase.

2025-07-10T16:52:15,"Coinbase and Perplexity create AI-crypto fused market tracker","Coinbase has announced a partnership with artificial intelligence-powered search engine Perplexity AI to deliver real-time crypto data services. The collaboration, unveiled on Thursday by CEO Brian Armstrong, could improve the quality and accessibility of market information for digital asset traders by combining AI and blockchain technology. The first phase of the integration will use Coinbase’s proprietary market data, including its COIN50 index, into Perplexity’s data systems. It will be used to power crypto market analysis for traders to track price movements before taking positions. CEO Brian Armstrong said the collaboration is the beginning of a multi-phase strategy to embed crypto functionality more deeply into AI tools. “ Users can double click into price moves to help make better informed trade decisions ,” Armstrong posted on X. He added that the goal is to reach a point where crypto wallets are fully integrated into large language models (LLMs), which he called a “huge step towards a permissionless, digital economy.” Coinbase and Perplexity create AI-crypto fused market tracker In his X post, Armstrong said he was confident that the overlap between AI and crypto will deliver exponential value to both industries. “I expect enhanced crypto functionality will be a catalyst for AI to achieve another 10x unlock,” the 42-year-old business executive wrote. Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas also commented on the partnership via X, stating: “Excited to partner with Coinbase to bring in real-time crypto data into Perplexity Finance! We will begin to surface this directly into user queries shortly.” Excited to partner with @coinbase to bring in real time crypto data into Perplexity Finance! We will begin to surface this directly into user queries shortly. https://t.co/J1vPAsQFub — Aravind Srinivas (@AravSrinivas) July 10, 2025 The LLM has already commenced ingesting Coinbase’s market data, including the COIN50 index, to support its analysis tools. The second phase of the partnership will allow Perplexity to use Coinbase’s data to directly respond to user search queries. This will include a conversational interface to improve accessibility for retail and institutional users. The timing of the announcement is just a day after Bitcoin, the world’s largest crypto by market cap, surpassed $112,000 to hit a new all-time high. Market analysts believe that search traffic tends to spike during market bull runs, and there is now a relevance for real-time crypto data integrations like the one Coinbase and Perplexity are building. Coinbase taps Copper’s ClearLoop for off-exchange settlement In a separate development also announced earlier today, Coinbase revealed it has integrated with ClearLoop, an off-exchange settlement solution developed by London-based Copper. The new service will help institutional clients transact using crypto more flexibly in their trading operations . Through ClearLoop, institutions can manage collateral and settle trades in near real-time without transferring assets directly onto the exchange. The platform’s multiparty computation (MPC) technology allows institutional clients to control their funds in centralized exchange trading. It could also reduce counterparty risk and improve capital efficiency, two long-standing concerns for professional traders operating at high volume. ClearLoop’s MPC-based model allows users to trade virtual balances on exchanges while actual settlement happens through Copper’s infrastructure. According to Coinbase, there has been “high” demand for such infrastructure upgrades among clients who want to minimize the risks associated with moving large sums onto exchanges. “ Institutions want this functionality and flexibility because ClearLoop enables a jumpstep in the off-exchange settlement times ,” a Coinbase spokesperson said. “T his improves the user experience of managing collateral, reducing counterparty risk, and improving capital efficiency .” Ethena, a stablecoin protocol recognized for supporting the synthetic dollar USDe, has been named as one of the first partners to adopt the ClearLoop integration at launch. The service is regulated under the Bermuda Monetary Authority and is available only with USDC as the collateral asset. Coinbase promised to add support for additional assets in future updates. “ This significant integration with Coinbase International Exchange expands institutional access to rapid, secure off-exchange trading and settlement ,” said Amar Kuchinad, global CEO of Copper.

The Cardano Foundation disclosed its financial allocations and asset composition in its 2024 Financial Insights Report, published on-chain on July 10. Just published: Our 2024 Financial Insights Report, fully on-chain using Reeve. Highlights: • $22.1M allocated across adoption, education, and resilience • $659.1M in assets (as of 31 Dec 2024) • 17.1M $ADA earned via staking Explore the report: https://t.co/NwKl4oEw3C — Cardano Foundation (@Cardano_CF) July 10, 2025 As of December 31, 2024, the Foundation reported total assets of $659.1 million. Of this, 76.7% was held in ADA, 14.9% in Bitcoin, and 8.3% in cash, cash equivalents, or other financial instruments. Cardano Foundation Releases 2024 Financial Report The report states that staking rewards from ADA holdings accounted for most of the organization’s income last year, totaling 17.1 million ADA from 599.2 million ADA held. The Foundation allocated $22.1 million across three functional areas—operational resilience, education, and ecosystem adoption. Another $7.1 million went toward internal operations, including governance, infrastructure, legal, and finance. Core initiatives included support for the Chang hard fork, compatibility with the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol, and funding for PRAGMA, an open-source collective. The Foundation also backed programs like the Cardano Blockchain Certified Associate and partnerships with Petrobras and Universidad Tecnológica Nacional. In terms of adoption efforts, the Foundation reported use case pilots such as a digital ballistic ID system and a real estate registry collaboration with Tokenance and YurekAI. The report emphasized traceability of expenditure by storing all disclosures directly on-chain. No forward-looking budget or projected ADA liquidation schedule was included. While ADA remains the primary asset, the Foundation’s BTC position represents partial diversification into liquid and established cryptocurrencies. Charles Hoskinson Suggests Bitcoin for Treasury In June 2025, Charles Hoskinson proposed converting $100 million of ADA into stablecoins and Bitcoin to improve Cardano’s liquidity and support DeFi growth. He said the sale could be handled off-market to avoid price disruption. He also suggested a sovereign-style fund managed by a governance board and third-party asset managers. This marked a shift from the 2024 treasury strategy, which focused solely on ADA holdings. Protocol treasuries are starting to diversify beyond native tokens to manage volatility and increase liquidity options. Some networks now include BTC or stablecoins to support spending flexibility without relying solely on internal assets. Cardano’s asset mix, and the 2025 proposal to add more external holdings, adds to this shift . It raises questions around risk control, governance structure, and transparency when treasury assets are no longer limited to a single token ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why is Bitcoin included in Cardano’s treasury? Bitcoin provides liquid and widely traded reserves, offering diversification outside ADA and aligning with broader multi-asset treasury trends. How might treasury diversification affect Cardano’s governance? Introducing Bitcoin or stablecoins may require updated governance frameworks, including third-party oversight or new voting mechanisms to manage multi-asset strategies. What distinguishes Cardano’s treasury management from other protocols? While many protocols hold their native tokens exclusively, Cardano has disclosed a substantial BTC position and is considering formal proposals to expand this approach.

2025-07-10T16:50:39,"BIT Mining Unveils Bold $300M Solana Treasury Initiative","Imagine a well-established Bitcoin miner, known for its deep roots in the proof-of-work world, suddenly making a monumental leap into the fast-paced, proof-of-stake ecosystem of Solana. This isn’t a hypothetical scenario; it’s precisely what China’s prominent Bitcoin miner , BIT Mining (BTCM), has announced. The company is setting its sights on a significant expansion into the Solana (SOL) network, with ambitious plans to raise between $200 million and $300 million to establish a dedicated SOL treasury . This strategic pivot signals a fascinating evolution in the cryptocurrency landscape, prompting us to ask: What drives such a shift, and what could it mean for the future of crypto investment ? BIT Mining’s Strategic Shift: A New Horizon For years, BIT Mining has been synonymous with large-scale Bitcoin mining operations. Their infrastructure and expertise have been honed in the demanding world of securing the Bitcoin network. However, the recent announcement on their official website marks a clear intention to diversify and embrace new opportunities. The core of this initiative is to leverage their existing capabilities to support the Solana network, which is known for its high throughput and low transaction costs. By building a substantial SOL treasury , BIT Mining aims to not only strengthen its financial reserves but also actively participate in the growth and development of the Solana ecosystem through ongoing acquisitions of SOL tokens. This move highlights a growing trend among crypto-native companies to expand beyond their initial core competencies and explore adjacent, high-growth blockchain sectors. Why Solana? The Appeal of a Robust SOL Treasury The decision to focus on Solana is not arbitrary. Solana has rapidly emerged as a leading blockchain platform, often touted as an “Ethereum killer” due to its scalability and speed. Its vibrant developer community, growing DeFi (Decentralized Finance) landscape, and burgeoning NFT (Non-Fungible Token) market make it an attractive destination for significant capital deployment. For BIT Mining, establishing a substantial SOL treasury offers several compelling advantages: Diversification: Moving beyond a single asset (Bitcoin) reduces risk and opens up new revenue streams. Ecosystem Participation: Holding SOL tokens allows BIT Mining to actively participate in Solana’s governance, staking, and dApp ecosystem, potentially generating yield. Growth Potential: Solana’s rapid adoption and technological advancements present significant upside potential for the value of their SOL holdings. Infrastructure Leverage: While different from Bitcoin mining, the company’s experience in managing large-scale hardware and data centers could be adapted to support Solana validators or other network services. This strategic move by a major Bitcoin miner like BIT Mining underscores the increasing maturity and interoperability of the blockchain space, where companies are no longer confined to a single blockchain but seek to capitalize on the strengths of multiple networks. What Does This Mean for the Bitcoin Miner Landscape? BIT Mining ‘s pivot raises important questions about the future of traditional Bitcoin mining. Is this an isolated incident, or does it signal a broader trend? While Bitcoin mining remains a lucrative industry, it faces increasing challenges related to energy consumption, regulatory scrutiny, and diminishing block rewards over time. Companies like BIT Mining, with their foresight, might be recognizing the need to adapt and explore new avenues for growth and profitability. This shift could inspire other large-scale mining operations to consider diversifying their portfolios beyond just Bitcoin. Imagine a scenario where mining companies evolve into comprehensive blockchain infrastructure providers, supporting multiple networks. This could lead to: Increased capital flow into alternative layer-1 blockchains. New business models for existing mining firms. Greater integration between different blockchain ecosystems. It’s a fascinating evolution that suggests the term “ Bitcoin miner ” might soon encompass a much broader range of activities. Navigating Crypto Investment Opportunities: A Diversified Approach For investors, BIT Mining ‘s decision serves as a powerful case study in the importance of diversification within the volatile crypto market. While Bitcoin often dominates headlines, the rapid innovation in altcoins and new blockchain paradigms offers compelling crypto investment opportunities. A treasury strategy, as adopted by BIT Mining, involves not just holding assets but often actively managing them to maximize returns and minimize risk. This can include staking, lending, or participating in DeFi protocols. Such sophisticated treasury management goes beyond simple HODLing and reflects a more institutional approach to crypto assets. This development encourages individual and institutional investors alike to look beyond the dominant narratives and explore the vast potential across the entire crypto spectrum. Understanding the fundamentals of different blockchains, their use cases, and their ecosystem growth becomes paramount for informed crypto investment decisions. The Future of Crypto Treasury Management with Solana The concept of a corporate SOL treasury , or any significant crypto treasury for that matter, is becoming increasingly common. Companies are recognizing that holding digital assets can be a strategic advantage, offering liquidity, diversification, and potential appreciation. BIT Mining’s move to build a $200-$300 million SOL treasury is a bold statement, reflecting confidence in Solana ‘s long-term viability and the potential for substantial returns. This trend suggests a future where companies, regardless of their primary industry, might hold a diverse portfolio of digital assets as part of their balance sheet, moving beyond traditional fiat-only reserves. This could pave the way for more sophisticated financial products and services tailored to corporate crypto treasuries, further legitimizing digital assets as a fundamental component of modern finance. Concluding Thoughts: A Bold Step Forward BIT Mining ‘s strategic shift to embrace Solana and build a substantial SOL treasury is more than just a company announcement; it’s a bellwether for the evolving crypto industry. It highlights the growing interoperability between blockchains, the increasing importance of diversification for established crypto entities, and the continuous search for new growth frontiers. As a major Bitcoin miner takes this ambitious leap, it reinforces the idea that innovation and adaptability are key to thriving in the dynamic world of digital assets. This move by BIT Mining could inspire a new wave of strategic alliances and diversified investments, shaping the future of crypto investment for years to come.

The largest and oldest cryptocurrency hit $113,313 during the U.S. session, CoinDesk price data shows. It was up 3.7% over the past 24 hours. The new record comes less than a day after it briefly topped $112,000 on some exchanges, then retreated below $111,000 in the later hours. Bitcoin's rally to new highs was buoyed by strong inflows into ETFs, relentless corporate adoption by crypto treasury companies and an increasingly favorable regulatory climate, Gerry O'Shea, head of global market insights at Hashdex, said in a note. ""While the macro environment will continue to remain uncertain, we believe the bull market is far from over and new catalysts, including more institutional platforms allowing access to bitcoin, may help drive the price of BTC to $140,000 or higher this year,"" he said.

It recently crossed above $2,780. Arthur Hayes, the former BitMEX CEO, is betting big on Ethereum, calling for a rise to $10,000. With rising institutional inflows and a trend shift, ETH might be gearing up for a major breakout. It is currently trading at $2,782, with gains of over 4% in the last 24 hours. Arthur Hayes teased Ethereum hitting $10,000 in a recent post. He backed it with a chart showing early signs of strength in Ethereum’s price. The ETH/BTC pair is also bouncing off historic lows, which could mean a major trend shift is starting. Arise Chikun, it's time… $ETH = $10,000 Yachtzee pic.twitter.com/zRGlPh9LTJ — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) July 10, 2025 ETH/BTC Pair Shows a Key Trend Shift Ethereum has been in a steady downtrend against Bitcoin since 2021. After peaking above 0.08 BTC, ETH gradually lost ground, forming a consistent lower-high, lower-low pattern over the past two years. But it’s now showing early signs of a bounce from the 0.02 BTC level. This week’s strong move to 0.025 BTC with rising volume indicates that bullish momentum is building. In a recent Bankless podcast, Hayes had predicted that Ethereum could hit $10,000–$15,000, with global liquidity shifts and tighter capital controls. Institutional Inflows Are Picking Up Analysts note Ethereum’s growing institutional interest, citing strong inflows into ETH ETFs. Just yesterday, over $211 million flowed into Ethereum ETFs. BlackRock alone purchased $158.6 million worth of ETH. In June, whale wallets increased their ETH holdings by 36%, and liquid staking rose by nearly 1 million ETH. This shows long-term belief in the network. Ethereum also recently underwent a major upgrade, which sparked a 50% ETH rally. Hayes’s $10K prediction lines up with a rising trend, where companies are now holding Ethereum as a treasury asset. Besides, a recent Fidelity report highlights that Ethereum leads Solana and other chains in developer activity, total value locked (TVL), and stablecoin usage. ETH Outshines BTC in Futures Trading Data from Glassnode shows that Ethereum futures volume hit $62.1 billion, slightly ahead of Bitcoin’s $61.7 billion. This is a rare flip that suggests traders are shifting focus to ETH. At the same time, CME futures open interest for ETH has climbed to $3.27 billion, the highest since February, which is a clear sign of growing institutional demand. Investor Ted Pillows shared that Ethereum is currently outperforming Bitcoin, and smart money is already entering the market. He points out Ethereum’s current price pattern resembles Bitcoin’s breakout rally from 2020–2021, and a major surge could be around the corner. Experts suggest that major momentum is likely building across the broader Ethereum ecosystem in the second half of the year. Many believe that it can hit $10,000 by the end of this cycle.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/arthur-hayes-says-eth-to-10k-is-ethereums-big-breakout-coming/,"ETH|BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET","News|Ethereum",cryptocompare
2025-07-10T16:40:39,"Bitcoin Sales: Bhutan’s Astounding Strategy Outshines Germany’s Performance","In a surprising twist that has captured the attention of the global crypto community, the small Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan has remarkably outmaneuvered economic powerhouse Germany in recent Bitcoin sales performance. This unexpected development, highlighted by on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain, offers a fascinating case study in national crypto strategy and market timing. It challenges conventional wisdom and provides valuable insights into how even smaller nations can achieve significant gains in the volatile world of digital assets. Understanding the Bitcoin Sales Showdown: Bhutan vs. Germany The data presented by Lookonchain on X paints a clear, albeit astonishing, picture of two very different approaches to managing national Bitcoin reserves. While Germany, a major global economy, offloaded a substantial amount of Bitcoin, Bhutan executed a series of more strategic, higher-priced sales. Let’s break down the key figures: Germany’s Recent Bitcoin Activity: Volume Sold: 49,858 BTC Sale Period: June 19 to July 12, 2024 Total Sale Value: Approximately $2.87 billion Average Sale Price: Around $57,600 per BTC Missed Opportunity: If these coins were held, their current value would be approximately $5.54 billion, representing a missed gain of about $2.67 billion. Bhutan’s Strategic Bitcoin Sales: Volume Sold: 2,162 BTC Sale Period: Over the past year (across five transactions) Total Sale Value: Approximately $188.65 million Average Sale Price: A remarkable $87,249 per BTC To put this into perspective, here’s a comparative overview: Country BTC Sold Total Sale Value Average Sale Price Key Context / Outcome Germany 49,858 BTC $2.87 Billion $57,600 Missed $2.67 Billion in potential gains by selling at lower prices. Bhutan 2,162 BTC $188.65 Million $87,249 Achieved significantly higher average prices through strategic, staggered sales. Bhutan’s Astounding Bitcoin Strategy: A Closer Look How did Bhutan, a nation known more for its Gross National Happiness index than its crypto prowess, manage to secure such a superior average sale price for its Bhutan Bitcoin strategy ? The answer lies in a combination of factors, likely including long-term holding, strategic market timing, and perhaps a more patient approach to their digital asset reserves. Unlike Germany’s recent, seemingly urgent, large-volume sale, Bhutan’s transactions were spread out over a year, suggesting a more calculated method of profit-taking. The benefits of Bhutan’s approach are clear: Maximized Profits: By selling at an average of $87,249, Bhutan capitalized on Bitcoin’s higher price points, securing a better return on its investment. Reduced Market Impact: Spreading sales over multiple transactions and a longer period likely minimized the impact on Bitcoin’s price, preventing a significant dip that a single large sale could trigger. Strategic Patience: This approach suggests a long-term vision for their crypto holdings, waiting for opportune moments to liquidate rather than reacting to short-term market fluctuations or immediate liquidity needs. This demonstrates that even with a smaller volume, smart execution can lead to superior financial outcomes. Bhutan’s strategy might serve as a blueprint for other smaller nations or entities considering their own crypto ventures. Germany’s Crypto Holdings: What Went Wrong? Germany’s recent large-scale offloading of its Germany crypto holdings raises several questions. While the exact reasons for their sales are not publicly detailed, some possibilities include: Liquidation of Seized Assets: A significant portion of Germany’s Bitcoin holdings are believed to be seized from criminal enterprises. The sale might be part of a legal process to convert these assets into fiat currency for the state treasury. Risk Management: Governments, by nature, are often risk-averse. Selling off volatile assets like Bitcoin might be seen as a way to de-risk their balance sheets, especially amidst global economic uncertainties. Regulatory Clarity: The sales could also be a precursor to or a result of new internal policies or regulatory frameworks regarding digital assets within the German government. Missed Opportunity Cost: Regardless of the motivation, the timing resulted in a substantial missed opportunity. Selling at an average of $57,600 when Bitcoin was trading significantly higher shortly after, highlights the inherent challenge of market timing, especially for large-scale operations. The decision to sell nearly 50,000 BTC at an average price well below its recent peaks underscores the complexities and potential pitfalls of managing significant digital asset portfolios, even for sophisticated economies. Navigating Crypto Market Performance: Lessons Learned The stark contrast between Bhutan and Germany offers crucial lessons for anyone involved in the crypto space, from individual investors to institutional players. Understanding crypto market performance and how to navigate its volatility is paramount. Here are some actionable insights: The Power of Patience and Staggered Sales: Bhutan’s success underscores the benefit of not rushing to sell large quantities. Spreading sales over time can help achieve a better average price and minimize negative market impact. This is a classic dollar-cost averaging (DCA) in reverse – dollar-cost selling. Market Timing is Tricky: Even sophisticated entities can get market timing wrong. Germany’s case is a powerful reminder that predicting short-term price movements, especially for such large volumes, is incredibly difficult. For individual investors, this often translates to the adage: “Time in the market beats timing the market.” Understanding Your Goals: Are you holding for long-term appreciation, or are you looking to generate liquidity? Clear objectives are essential for any crypto strategy. Bhutan’s actions suggest a profit-taking objective from a long-term holding, while Germany’s might be more focused on liquidation or risk reduction. The Value of On-Chain Analytics: Tools like Lookonchain provide invaluable transparency into large transactions, allowing market participants to understand major movements and potentially anticipate market shifts. The Future of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption This tale of two nations also sheds light on the evolving landscape of institutional Bitcoin adoption and management. As more sovereign wealth funds, corporations, and even governments consider or expand their crypto holdings, the strategies employed by early movers like Bhutan and Germany become critical case studies. We are likely to see: Diversified National Portfolios: Nations may increasingly look to Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation or a strategic reserve asset, diversifying beyond traditional fiat and gold. Sophisticated Treasury Management: Governments will need to develop sophisticated treasury management strategies specifically tailored for highly volatile digital assets, including clear policies for acquisition, custody, and liquidation. Increased Transparency (and Scrutiny): As more institutional players enter the space, their actions will be subject to greater public and analytical scrutiny, influencing market sentiment and policy discussions. The lessons from Bhutan and Germany are not just about profit and loss; they are about the maturation of the crypto market and the increasing importance of digital assets on the global stage. Conclusion: A New Era of National Crypto Strategies The surprising success of Bhutan’s Bitcoin sales strategy over Germany’s recent performance is a compelling narrative that underscores the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. It highlights that size and traditional economic power do not automatically translate to superior performance in the digital asset space. Instead, patience, strategic timing, and a clear understanding of market dynamics appear to be the true keys to unlocking value.

2025-07-10T16:39:58,"Strategy Be Forced to Dump Its $66 Billion Bitcoin Pile?","The post Strategy Be Forced to Dump Its $66 Billion Bitcoin Pile? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Strategy (MSTR) has long been the poster child for corporate Bitcoin adoption. With 597,3250 BTC on its balance sheet, valued at over $66.75 billion. But behind this giant bet, new filings show risks that could force them to sell Bitcoin sooner than people think. From surprise tax bills to huge debts, here’s why Strategy’s Bitcoin fortress might not be as secure as it looks. Big Unrealized Gains, Real Tax Bills Strategy bought all its Bitcoin for around $42.4 billion, but now it’s worth over $66.67 billion. With a recent change in accounting rules (ASU 2023-08) means Strategy now has to report the value of its Bitcoin at current market prices, not just what it paid for it. Starting in 2026, this could mean a 15% minimum tax on these “paper gains.” If this happens, Strategy might owe billions in taxes, even if they haven’t sold a single Bitcoin. And they’re not sugarcoating it. The filing clearly states that if needed, they might sell Bitcoin to cover the tax bills. Taxes Could Force a Bitcoin Sale In its recent SEC filing (Form 8-K), Strategy warns that if the tax hits, they may need to sell Bitcoin or borrow more money to cover the cost. The company admits its software business alone won’t bring in enough cash to pay these taxes plus other expenses. Strategy’s money problems don’t stop at taxes. They have $8.2 billion in debt and $3.4 billion in preferred stock, creating over $350 million every year in interest and dividend payments. Some dividends must be paid in cash and can’t be skipped without penalties. Storage Isn’t Risk-Free There’s another hidden risk, if their Bitcoin custodian ever goes bankrupt, Strategy could lose access to its coins. In that situation, they’d be just another creditor trying to get their Bitcoin back. Strategy says any sudden shock could weaken the value of their holding or push them to sell faster than planned. Cash Flow Isn’t Keeping Up Strategy admits their software business isn’t generating enough money to pay off mounting obligations. Their annual cash burden, between interest and dividends, now sits north of $350 million. That includes $36.5 million in interest and $315.9 million owed to preferred shareholders. Some of those dividends must be paid in cash, no exceptions. If they can’t raise enough through new funding, they may have to sell Bitcoin.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/strategy-be-forced-to-dump-its-66-billion-bitcoin-pile/,"BTC|REGULATION|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY","News",cryptocompare

This historic level is being supported by increased institutional interest, general risk appetite in the markets, and upcoming regulatory action. Chart showing the recent rise in Bitcoin price. In the last 24 hours of the surge, a total of $563.84 million worth of positions were liquidated. $496 million of this came from short positions and only $67 million from long positions.

Nvidia achieved a historic feat by briefly reaching a market capitalization of $4 trillion. The Nasdaq Composite index also closed at a record high. This risk-taking trend creates a positive environment for assets like Bitcoin. Ryan Gorman, Uranium Digital's strategy director, stated that the “crypto week” event to be held next week in Washington DC and the decreasing transaction volumes entering the summer season could pave the way for sharp increases in Bitcoin, making the following assessment: “Given the combination of upward momentum and shrinking volumes, it wouldn't be surprising if Bitcoin jumps to $120,000 next week. It's unclear how much higher we'll go over the summer, but call interest has surpassed put interest in the options market, clearly indicating traders' bullish outlook.” *This is not investment advice.

The asset rallied to $112,000 on some trading venues and above on others. Burakkesmeci, an analyst at the market intelligence platform CryptoQuant, has revealed that strong BTC purchases in the United States fueled the rally. This is evident in the Coinbase Premium Index, which climbed a few points during the surge. The index tracks BTC demand among U.S. investors. Coinbase Premium Rises According to Burakkesmeci, the Coinbase Premium surged to 42 points. This indicates that investors on the largest US crypto exchange paid $42 more per BTC than those on its rival, Binance. The uptick also indicates significant demand from U.S.-based investors. The CryptoQuant analyst noted that the Coinbase Premium gap was not the weekly high. The index peaked at $87.76 last week, revealing stronger buying pressure among investors. This index has historically surged during bitcoin rallies and plummeted during declines. A positive flip suggests growing institutional and retail interest in BTC, while a negative premium signals more selling. Burakkesmeci said demand for BTC remains strong, even after the asset reached a new high. This could be a sign that the bulls are not done. Persistent Institutional and ETF Demand In line with the uptick in Coinbase Premium, the U.S. spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) market has been experiencing massive inflows. In the past 21 trading days, these funds have recorded just one day of outflows. The ETFs have garnered at least $4.5 billion in positive flows so far in July and are likely to continue doing so in the coming weeks. The market has witnessed a rise in institutional interest, with several corporate treasuries adopting Bitcoin strategies and becoming Bitcoin treasury companies. The creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the U.S. has played a huge role in this rising adoption. Most analysts insist that bitcoin’s short-term outlook remains bullish and could only be slightly swayed by unfavorable macroeconomic conditions. However, provided ETF and institutional demand do not falter as the asset prepares for its last leg of this bull cycle, BTC has a higher chance of surviving market storms.

2025-07-10T16:32:22,"Jack Doresy shares second decentralized messaging app, White Noise","Yesterday, Jack Dorsey shared the website for a new decentralized messaging app called White Noise. This app differs from Bitchat, which he released for beta testing a few days earlier. White Noise is built on Nostr—short for “Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays”—and uses the MLS (Messaging Layer Security) protocol. Nostr is an open protocol for building decentralized social networks. It’s a transport protocol and the framework for the conversations in each chat. MLS treats messages as authenticated events in a tree-structured key agreement (TreeKEM) instead of using separate pairwise channels. Both Bitchat and White Noise are decentralized and distributed, but Bitchat relies on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) mesh networks while White Noise uses a network of independent relays that anyone can run. Bitchat can operate entirely offline, whereas White Noise depends on internet connectivity. Source: Jack Dorsey via X. What makes White Noise highly secure? Dorsey’s newest messaging app is open source, combining decentralized technologies, encryption, and peer-to-peer networking. This ensures users retain full control over their conversations. The messaging app has no single point of failure, making the network immune to shutdowns and control. This is because White Noise operates on a network of independent relays that forward messages between devices. Users have the freedom to choose between public and private relays operated by “trusted communities.” Tech-savvy users can self-host White Noise on private servers. Users who opt for private relays will incur minimal costs. Dynamic encryption is enforced through the MLS protocol. Every message is end-to-end encrypted, and in the event of a breach, a post-compromise mechanism protects conversations. Hackers can’t access past messages thanks to “forward secrecy,” and future messages remain protected by “rotating encryption keys.” If an internet service provider (ISP) captures traffic, it will see scrambled data because the MSL protocol encrypts metadata and reveals nothing about the message content. Moreover, the MSL protocol is capable of adopting advanced cryptographic algorithms, like quantum-resistant algorithms, without rebuilding the messaging application. In addition, users can operate White Noise on multiple devices such as a phone, tablet, or computer. This is possible due to MLS’s “leaf nodes,” which deal with each device as a distinct participant during the encryption operation. The MSL protocol is capable of handling group chats with more than 1,000 members. Through optimizing key distribution, MSL reduces computation workload on devices. Nostr, on the other hand, routes messages efficiently. White Noise is “engineered for real-time performance” and built for speed and reliability. According to the website, the messaging app is backed by OpenSats and Human Rights Foundation. OpenSats is a non-profit organization that provides support and funding to open-source projects that help accelerate Bitcoin adoption. White Noise is currently available for testing via Apple’s TestFlight, Android’s Zapstore, and an Android APK.

2025-07-10T16:30:24,"Bitcoin HODL Momentum Drops: Long-Term Conviction Builds","Bitcoin reached a new all-time high yesterday, briefly pushing above the $112,000 mark and confirming bullish sentiment across the market. This move has reignited optimism among investors, with many now eyeing a potential breakout into price discovery. The rally comes as Bitcoin has held strong above key support levels in recent weeks, defying bearish expectations and maintaining upward pressure. However, not everyone is convinced. Some analysts argue that this breakout might be a short-lived fakeout rather than the beginning of a sustainable rally. With volatility still low and macro conditions stable, opposing views are calling for caution, warning that BTC could retrace and re-enter its prior range below resistance. Top analyst On-Chain Mind weighed in by highlighting an important on-chain signal: HODL Momentum is trending back downwards. The downward shift in this metric suggests that fewer long-term holders are distributing into this rally, which is generally a bullish sign . Bulls Eye Breakout As HODL Momentum Strengthens After reaching a new all-time high just above $112,000, Bitcoin is now consolidating beneath this key resistance level. Bulls are clearly in control, but the market is awaiting a clean, sustained breakout above $112K to confirm the next leg of the rally. So far, BTC has maintained strength above prior support zones and continues to trade in a tight range, hinting that a decisive move is imminent. Macroeconomic developments remain supportive of risk assets. The U.S. Congress passed President Donald Trump’s highly anticipated “big, beautiful” bill just before the July 4 deadline. This legislation includes substantial tax cuts and aggressive spending measures, which are expected to drive inflationary pressure, conditions that historically benefit Bitcoin. Additionally, strong labor market data in the US has improved investor sentiment, helping to anchor bullish expectations. Adding to the positive outlook, on-chain data offers compelling evidence of long-term confidence. On-Chain Mind points out that HODL Momentum is now trending downward. This indicator measures the relative strength of Bitcoin holders who have kept their coins unmoved for more than one year. A decline in this metric suggests that long-term holders are not distributing into the rally, an encouraging sign for bulls. This behavior implies strong conviction and a willingness to hold through volatility, rather than locking in gains prematurely. Historically, when long-term holders choose to stay put while prices climb, Bitcoin tends to experience powerful upward extensions. As the market digests macro shifts and psychological resistance, all eyes remain on the $112K level for confirmation. If broken cleanly, it could mark the beginning of a fresh surge into uncharted territory. BTC Price Analysis: Holding the Breakout Zone Bitcoin is trading at $111,079 on the 12-hour chart after briefly pushing above the $112,000 mark, marking a new all-time high before slightly retracing. Despite the pullback, BTC is still holding well above the previous resistance level at $109,300, which is now acting as support. This structure confirms a breakout attempt, and bulls are now tasked with maintaining momentum for further upside. The chart shows increasing volume during the breakout, indicating strong market participation. The price also remains above the 50-, 100-, and 200-period moving averages, all of which are sloping upward, suggesting bullish continuation. As long as Bitcoin continues to close candles above the $109,300 support, the breakout remains valid. The 12-hour structure also highlights a higher-low pattern dating back to late June, adding strength to the bullish setup. A successful defense of current levels could pave the way for a clean retest of $112,000, and potentially send BTC into price discovery territory. However, failure to hold the breakout zone could result in a drop toward $106,800 or even $103,600, where previous support and moving average confluence sit. For now, the market is watching closely for confirmation of this breakout as bulls attempt to maintain control.

The token delivered a bullish performance, climbing to $3.24 from $2.94 with a trading range of $0.34 that reflects 11.5% volatility, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. It built substantial upward momentum featuring notable volume surges at $2.99 and $3.10, demonstrating strong institutional accumulation and validating these breakout points as high-volume foundation levels. Critical resistance materialized at $3.27 where the price encountered reversal amid heightened volume, while support stabilized within the $3.20-$3.21 zone during late trading hours, indicating possible accumulation positioning for continued upward movement. The bullish momentum comes after several catalysts for the token, including the launch of Threshold Network's tBTC, an ERC-20 token backed 1-to-1 by bitcoin, on the Sui blockchain earlier this week which could potentially add over $500 million in bitcoin liquidity to the Sui network. Sui ranks among the top five layer-1 networks, with daily volume up about 135% versus the market’s average of 52%, according to data on Coinbase. The token has risen more than 340% in the past 12 months, outpacing the broader crypto market as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index , which rose about 2.8% over the same period.

2025-07-10T16:20:39,"Ethereum Futures Unleashes Remarkable Volume, Surpassing Bitcoin","In a surprising turn of events that has the entire crypto community buzzing, Ethereum (ETH) has achieved a rare and significant milestone. For the first time in a long while, the 24-hour Ethereum futures volume has surged past that of Bitcoin (BTC), signaling a potential shift in the digital asset landscape. This isn’t just a fleeting moment; it’s a data point that could herald deeper changes in trader focus and market dynamics. What’s Behind the Surge in Ethereum Futures Volume? The news, reported by on-chain analytics firm Glassnode on X, revealed that Ethereum’s 24-hour futures volume reached an astounding $62.1 billion, eclipsing Bitcoin’s $61.7 billion. This inversion of typical market dominance is a significant indicator. But what exactly is fueling this sudden surge in interest in Ethereum futures ? Anticipation of Spot ETH ETFs: Much like the excitement that surrounded Bitcoin spot ETFs, there’s growing speculation about the potential approval of Ethereum spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the United States. This prospect often leads to increased futures trading as institutional and retail investors position themselves ahead of potential market-moving events. Dencun Upgrade Momentum: The recent Dencun upgrade for Ethereum introduced several improvements, most notably EIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding), which aims to reduce transaction fees on Layer 2 networks. Such fundamental protocol enhancements can boost confidence and activity around the asset. Growing Utility and Ecosystem: Ethereum continues to be the backbone of the decentralized finance (DeFi), NFT, and Web3 ecosystems. As these sectors mature and expand, the underlying asset, ETH, gains more utility and attracts more capital. Shifting Trader Sentiment: There might be a subtle but growing shift in how traders perceive Ethereum relative to Bitcoin. While Bitcoin is often seen as “digital gold,” Ethereum is viewed as a “programmable money” with broader application potential, potentially attracting a different type of speculative interest. Comparing Bitcoin Futures and ETH’s Rise For years, Bitcoin futures have consistently dominated the crypto derivatives market. Bitcoin’s status as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and its first-mover advantage have cemented its position as the primary speculative vehicle. However, Ethereum’s recent feat challenges this long-standing hierarchy. Historically, when comparing the trading volumes: Metric Bitcoin Futures (Typical) Ethereum Futures (Typical) Ethereum Futures (Recent Peak) 24h Volume Higher than ETH Lower than BTC $62.1 Billion Market Dominance Primary Secondary Temporarily Surpassed BTC Investor Profile Broader, institutional Growing, DeFi-centric Expanding This momentary flip in volume suggests that a significant amount of capital and attention is flowing into Ethereum derivatives. It doesn’t necessarily mean Ethereum is replacing Bitcoin as the market leader, but it certainly indicates a diversification of focus among high-volume traders. Understanding the Broader Crypto Market Implications What does this mean for the wider crypto market ? An increase in Ethereum’s futures volume, especially when it surpasses Bitcoin’s, can have several ripple effects: Potential for “Altcoin Season”: While not a definitive signal, a strong ETH performance often precedes or accompanies a broader rally in altcoins. As capital flows into Ethereum, it can spill over into other smaller cap assets within the ecosystem. Increased Volatility: Higher trading volumes in futures markets can lead to increased price volatility. Traders need to be aware of the magnified risks and opportunities this presents. Shifting Narrative: It reinforces the narrative that Ethereum is a significant, fundamental layer of the crypto economy, not just an “altcoin” that follows Bitcoin. This could attract more mainstream attention and investment. Market Maturation: The ability of another asset like Ethereum to command such significant derivatives volume indicates a maturing market where participants are looking beyond just Bitcoin for trading opportunities. For investors, understanding these dynamics is crucial. It suggests that diversification and staying informed about ecosystem-specific developments for major altcoins like Ethereum are becoming increasingly important. Analyzing the Significance of Increased Trading Volume High trading volume in futures markets is more than just a number; it’s a barometer of market sentiment and liquidity. When volume spikes, it often means: Strong Conviction: Large volumes indicate that a significant number of participants are taking positions, suggesting strong conviction (either bullish or bearish) about the asset’s future price. Enhanced Liquidity: High volume ensures better liquidity, making it easier for large orders to be filled without significantly impacting the price. This attracts more institutional players. Price Discovery: Active trading contributes to efficient price discovery, as a wide range of opinions and strategies are reflected in the market. The fact that Ethereum is seeing such robust volume indicates that market participants are actively engaging with ETH, placing substantial bets on its trajectory. This is a positive sign for the health and vibrancy of the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole, reflecting confidence in its underlying technology and future prospects. What Potential Market Catalysts Are On The Horizon for ETH? The current surge in Ethereum’s futures volume isn’t happening in a vacuum. Several potential market catalysts could continue to fuel interest and price action for ETH: Spot Ethereum ETF Decisions: The most significant near-term catalyst remains the decision by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on various spot Ethereum ETF applications. A positive decision could unlock significant institutional capital, similar to Bitcoin’s experience. Further Protocol Upgrades: Beyond Dencun, Ethereum’s roadmap includes future upgrades focused on scalability, security, and sustainability (e.g., The Surge, The Scourge, The Verge, The Purge, The Splurge). Each successful upgrade reinforces Ethereum’s technological leadership. DeFi and NFT Sector Growth: Continued innovation and adoption within decentralized finance and non-fungible tokens, largely built on Ethereum, will naturally drive demand and utility for ETH. Macroeconomic Environment: A favorable macroeconomic environment, characterized by lower interest rates or increased risk appetite, could also boost the broader crypto market, benefiting Ethereum. These catalysts suggest that Ethereum is not just riding on the coattails of Bitcoin but is increasingly charting its own course, driven by its unique technological advancements and growing ecosystem. Ethereum’s recent achievement of surpassing Bitcoin in 24-hour futures volume is a remarkable moment in the crypto landscape. It underscores the growing maturity of the Ethereum ecosystem and its increasing importance as a standalone investment and trading asset. While Bitcoin remains the dominant force, this event highlights a diversifying market where Ethereum is carving out its own significant share of investor attention and capital. This shift could signal a new phase for the crypto market, one where Ethereum’s fundamental strength and future potential are more prominently recognized. As the market evolves, keeping a close eye on these changing dynamics will be crucial for navigating the opportunities ahead.

2025-07-10T16:19:00,"BIT Mining bets on Solana, plans crypto war chest for $300m SOL treasury","BIT Mining is ditching diversification to go all-in on Solana. The firm will liquidate its current crypto portfolio and raise up to $300 million to build a SOL-heavy treasury while staking its future on one chain. On July 10, NYSE-listed crypto mining company BIT Mining announced a radical pivot from its Bitcoin ( BTC )-centric roots, unveiling plans to raise as much as $300 million to amass a Solana ( SOL )-dominated treasury. The company said it will convert its existing crypto reserves, previously diversified across assets like BTC, Litecoin ( LTC ), and Dogecoin ( DOGE ), into SOL and build exposure in phases, depending on capital availability. The move signals BIT Mining’s full-throttle embrace of Solana’s high-speed ecosystem, with plans to hold SOL long-term and actively participate in operating the network’s validator nodes. You might also like: WhiteBIT’s native token WTB defies market volatility with triple-digit growth in 2025 BIT Mining’s Solana gamble: high-speed bet or desperate pivot? BIT Mining’s shift into Solana isn’t just a diversification play. It can also be seen as a calculated survival move in an industry where Bitcoin mining margins continue to erode. “This strategic move reflects our commitment to staying adaptive and responsive in an ever-evolving industry. With our strong execution capabilities and long-term vision, we are confident in our ability to accelerate sustainable growth and deliver lasting value to our shareholders.” Xianfeng Yang, CEO of BIT Mining, said. The company’s decision to liquidate its existing crypto holdings and funnel everything into SOL mirrors a growing trend among public miners scrambling for post-halving relevance. But unlike Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin-maximalist treasury strategy, BIT Mining is taking cues from firms like SharpLink, which has successfully transformed itself into an Ethereum staking powerhouse. The iGaming firm has rapidly become the second-largest Ethereum holder behind the Ethereum Foundation, staking its entire balance sheet and reporting precision ETH-per-share exposure to investors. SharpLink’s results are already measurable: a 19% increase in ETH concentration per 1,000 shares in just three weeks, paired with a 26% rally in its stock after announcing its latest Ether acquisition on July 8. BIT Mining appears to be following a similar trajectory, but with Solana, recasting itself not only as a major token holder, but also as a validator and yield-seeking participant in the network’s consensus layer. The market’s initial reaction suggests investors are buying the vision, at least for now. BIT Mining’s stock (BTCM) surged over 300% in pre-market trading following the news, according to TradingView data . But where SharpLink has methodically tracked its ETH-per-share exposure to reassure investors, BIT Mining’s plan remains light on specifics. The company hasn’t disclosed how much SOL it currently holds or what its staking targets are, leaving analysts to wonder whether this is a disciplined treasury strategy or a Hail Mary.

2025-07-10T16:17:09,"Why 24/7 Digital Markets Will Power Development in Frontier Economies","Goodbye to vague notions of “soft power” and “impact investing.” Hello to benchmarking, concrete KPIs, and sovereign capital deployed with precision. In the 20th century, Bretton Woods and the Marshall Plan set the financial blueprint for postwar recovery. While the stakes today are just as high, the tools are different. From Ukraine to sub-Saharan Africa, frontier markets are fighting for financial credibility in a trust-scarce world. Traditional aid models, plagued by opacity and inefficiency, have been further dismantled by the Trump Administration’s DOGE initiative, which is moving to replace aid with measurable, tech-enabled delivery systems. Tokenization is the inevitable endgame. BlackRock Offers a Path Forward BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), with over $14 billion in inflows and nearly $200 million in annual fee revenue, has become not only a standout among new ETFs but a symbol of shifting institutional risk tolerance. Its meteoric rise demonstrates growing acceptance of digital assets as a standalone investment class, particularly among institutional investors once wary of volatility. As mainstream allocators embrace digital assets through regulated vehicles like IBIT, capital markets are beginning to reflect a broader appetite for asymmetric upside—an investment profile long associated with frontier economies. Frontier markets, characterized by political uncertainty, thin liquidity, and underdeveloped financial infrastructure, have historically struggled to attract stable foreign direct investment. But the institutional normalization of bitcoin and other decentralized assets is paving new pathways for capital to reach these regions. Just as ETFs like IBIT have created a regulated bridge into crypto, new financial structures—tokenized infrastructure, auditable capital flows, and blockchain-based land registries—are likely to do the same for frontier development. The same investors pouring billions into Bitcoin ETFs may soon view frontier economies not as exotic risk, but as parallel vehicles for exponential returns, particularly when paired with digital rails designed with transparency and scalability in mind. A Data Entry Revolution for Global Aid At the root of every successful logistics or capital deployment strategy lies a surprisingly mundane concept: data entry. Every bottle of clean water, every corrugated roof panel, every bolt of fabric destined for refugee housing must be recorded, reconciled, and reported. Today, this is done manually across dozens of silos: UN spreadsheets, NGO CRMs, local government PDFs. But tokenizing these entries—embedding them in smart contracts, linking them to geolocation, timestamp, and vendor profiles—creates a live ledger of aid in motion. This new approach towards accountability will enable not just transparent procurement but tokenized local liquidity: local entrepreneurs paid in stablecoin, verified vendors rewarded with smart grants, or veteran-owned Ukrainian firms given tradable carbon or aid credits. Tokenization allows physical goods, services, and contractual obligations to be represented as digital assets on immutable ledgers. In practice, this means a water pump in Sumy or a shipment of medical supplies in Sudan can be tracked, verified, and paid for in real time without bureaucratic drag or trust deficits. A properly structured token ecosystem creates global, auditable, and real-time liquidity for critical development resources: a 24/7 commodity market for gravel, steel, solar panels, or cement in post-conflict zones. 24/7 Markets: A Strategic Imperative for the U.S.? Global commodity markets are not built for the rhythms of frontier states. Most development needs—timber, power tools, clean water filtration—are transacted through arcane, manually priced channels. This invites corruption, delays, and cost overruns. Tokenized markets enable round-the-clock pricing, liquidity, and settlement. A contractor rebuilding schools in South Sudan can lock in tomorrow’s price for sheet metal with a click. A regional bank in Tbilisi can see in real-time whether a food distribution contract has been fulfilled. Governments can collateralize transparent delivery records instead of hoping donors believe their paperwork. As China floods the Global South with opaque lending and Russia bankrolls destabilization, the U.S. needs a private-sector-led, transparency-first development model. Tokenized systems provide built-in auditability, modular integration, and sovereign-aligned incentives. And they align with the State Department's mandate toward outcomes-based aid, rather than a carte blanche check which too long defined U.S. foreign policy. Through our work at AUSP , we’ve seen firsthand that frontier markets are starving for trust, coordination, and clarity. Tokenization is not the starting point in these spaces, nor should it be, but it will be the final endpoint. In the interim, best practices for data entry to ensure that life-saving resources go towards their intended use is the priority; these logs will contain valuable data sets for reconstruction while laying the foundation for 24/7 frontier markets. What Bretton Woods did with pen and paper, tokenization will do with code: create a new financial order for U.S.-led reconstruction.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/07/10/why-247-digital-markets-will-power-development-in-frontier-economies,"MARKET|BTC|BUSINESS|ASIA|DOGE","Opinion|Opinion",cryptocompare

2025-07-10T16:12:12,"BIT Mining reinvents itself after its casino past","BIT Mining is the next company to announce an altcoin treasury, with big promises for $300M injected into SOL. The company raises red flags for its offshore connections and a relatively low BTC treasury. BIT Mining, a NYSE-listed company registered in an offshore territory, has promised to be among the first to implement a SOL treasury strategy. The company announced it would raise up to $300M, depending on market conditions, and switch its reserves to SOL. Currently, BIT Mining is ranked #102 based on a treasury of just 19 BTC, acquired at a price of $77,526. BIT Mining is the second BTC treasury company to pivot to an altcoin, following Bit Digital’s decision to fully shift to ETH. The scale of the SOL treasury is much larger compared to even the combined BTC and altcoin holdings of BIT Mining. The company also reported 1,246 ETH, 7.6M DOGE, 900K USDT, and 1,770 LTC. The assets were acquired during a period of mining activity and are held by BIT Mining Limited, a Cayman Islands holding company. BIT Mining intends to convert all holdings to SOL and participate in the Solana ecosystem as a validator and node operator. The SOL treasury will also accrue passive income through staking and rewards. BIT Mining reinvents itself after its casino past BIT Mining recently changed its identity from its former casino business, known as 500.com . The company had subsidiaries in Hong Kong, British Virgin Islands, Canada, Malta, Cyprus, Curacao, the United States, and China. In November 2024, the company was fined $10M in connection with a failed bribery scheme in Japan, where 500.com attempted to receive a casino license. The fine is owed to the US Department of Justice and partially to the US SEC, and was lowered from $54M due to inability to pay. Despite the company’s past, demand for treasury companies gives BIT Mining a chance at pivoting. The company retains its mining operations, data centers, hosting, and hardware, but will expand into Solana’s staking ecosystem. Treasury announcement revives BIT Mining share price BIT Mining lost over 98% of its price since the initial listing in 2015. Over the years, the company stock continued to slide, down to a valuation of just $40M. BIT Mining went vertical following the SOL treasury announcement, but is still down from its peak by 98%. | Source: Google Finance The recent SOL treasury announcement brought the price of BIT Mining to the highest level in the past 12 months, above $5.80. BTCM shares expanded by over 90% in the past year on average, but gained a net 137% in the past five days. The treasury effect may be short-lived, as the shares quickly slid from their peak of $6.97. BIT Mining is also not clear about its plan to acquire SOL, using the announcement effect to boost its visibility and share price. The company announced that SOL acquisitions will depend on access to capital and market conditions, a feat that is difficult even for large-scale BTC treasury companies. For now, the leading Solana treasury company is still DeFi Development Corp., still trading near its higher range at $22.86.

2025-07-10T16:10:39,"Bitcoin’s Astounding Surge: US Investors Fuel BTC All-Time High","The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with excitement, and for good reason! Bitcoin (BTC) recently shattered records, hitting an astonishing new all-time high of $112,014. While such milestones always spark curiosity, a deeper dive reveals a fascinating driving force behind this monumental surge: aggressive buying from U.S. investors. This isn’t just speculation; it’s a conclusion backed by insightful CryptoQuant analysis , shedding light on the powerful dynamics at play in the market. Understanding the Coinbase Premium: A Key Indicator for Bitcoin Price When we talk about the influence of U.S. buyers, a crucial metric comes into play: the Coinbase Premium . But what exactly is it, and why is it so important for understanding Bitcoin price movements? The Coinbase Premium Gap measures the difference in Bitcoin’s price on Coinbase, a popular U.S.-based exchange, compared to other global exchanges like Binance. A positive premium indicates that buyers on Coinbase are willing to pay more for BTC than their counterparts elsewhere. This often signals strong demand from U.S. institutional and large retail investors, who frequently use Coinbase due to its regulatory compliance and liquidity. Recent Spike: CryptoQuant, citing crypto analyst Burak Kesmeci, highlighted that the Coinbase Premium Gap for BTC recently swelled to 42 points. This means U.S. buyers on Coinbase were paying a significant $42 more per Bitcoin than those trading on Binance. Aggressive Accumulation: This wasn’t an isolated incident. Just the week prior, the gap expanded even further, reaching as high as $87.76. Such consistent and substantial premiums are a clear indicator of aggressive accumulation by U.S. entities, signaling strong confidence and a willingness to acquire BTC at higher prices. Market Barometer: The Coinbase Premium acts as a real-time barometer for U.S. demand, offering valuable insights into the conviction of a major segment of the global crypto market. Why Are US Crypto Investors So Aggressive? The question naturally arises: what’s fueling this remarkable aggression from US crypto investors ? Several factors contribute to the robust demand observed on U.S. exchanges, distinguishing them from other global markets: 1. Institutional Inflows and Spot ETFs: The approval of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the U.S. has been a game-changer. These ETFs provide a regulated, accessible, and familiar pathway for traditional financial institutions, wealth managers, and even individual investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. The sheer volume of inflows into these ETFs since their launch has been unprecedented, acting as a major demand driver. 2. Regulatory Clarity (or Perceived Clarity): While the U.S. regulatory landscape for crypto remains complex, the existence of regulated entities like Coinbase and the approval of ETFs provide a degree of comfort for larger players seeking compliant avenues for investment. This perceived clarity encourages more traditional capital to enter the market. 3. Macroeconomic Environment: Global economic uncertainties, inflation concerns, and the search for uncorrelated assets continue to push investors towards Bitcoin. U.S. investors, with significant capital, are often at the forefront of allocating funds to alternative assets like BTC as a hedge or growth opportunity. 4. Tech-Savvy Investor Base: The U.S. boasts a large and increasingly sophisticated investor base, including a significant number of tech-aware individuals and institutions eager to explore innovative investment opportunities in the digital asset space. BTC All-Time High: What Drove This Historic Milestone? The recent BTC all-time high wasn’t just a random event; it was the culmination of several converging factors, with U.S. buying playing a pivotal role. Beyond the direct demand from Coinbase, the broader market context provided fertile ground for this record-breaking surge: Pre-Halving Hype: Historically, Bitcoin’s halving events (which reduce the supply of new BTC) have preceded significant price rallies. The anticipation of the upcoming halving fueled bullish sentiment. Increasing Liquidity: Despite some market corrections, overall liquidity in the crypto market has been on an upward trend, indicating growing investor confidence and capital availability. Global Adoption: Beyond the U.S., increasing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies worldwide, from payment solutions to corporate treasury strategies, contributes to a positive long-term outlook for Bitcoin. The aggressive buying from U.S. investors, particularly through regulated channels, signifies a maturing market where institutional capital is increasingly dictating the pace. This shift from primarily retail-driven rallies to institutionally-backed surges adds a layer of stability and credibility to Bitcoin’s price discovery process. CryptoQuant Analysis Unveils Deeper Market Insights The insights provided by CryptoQuant are invaluable for understanding these complex market dynamics. CryptoQuant analysis utilizes on-chain data and proprietary metrics to provide a deeper look into investor behavior, market flows, and potential trends. Their platform tracks vast amounts of data, from exchange inflows/outflows to miner activity and derivatives markets, offering a comprehensive view of the crypto ecosystem. By specifically highlighting the Coinbase Premium Gap and attributing the recent BTC all-time high to U.S. buying, CryptoQuant and analyst Burak Kesmeci are providing actionable intelligence that goes beyond simple price charts. This type of data-driven analysis helps investors and traders make more informed decisions, understanding the underlying forces driving market movements rather than just reacting to them. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights for Investors Given the aggressive U.S. buying and Bitcoin’s recent record-breaking performance, what should investors consider? Stay Informed: Continue to monitor on-chain metrics and market analysis from reputable sources like CryptoQuant. Understanding the flow of capital can provide early signals of market shifts. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term volatility is inherent in crypto, the growing institutional interest and the structural drivers behind Bitcoin’s adoption suggest a strong long-term growth trajectory. Risk Management: Despite the bullish sentiment, the crypto market remains volatile. Always invest only what you can afford to lose and consider diversification within your portfolio. Understand the ‘Why’: Don’t just react to price movements. Try to understand the underlying reasons, whether it’s institutional demand, macroeconomic factors, or technological advancements, to make more reasoned investment choices. Conclusion: A New Era for Bitcoin’s Price Discovery Bitcoin’s recent ascent to an astounding new all-time high, significantly propelled by aggressive U.S. buying and a widening Coinbase Premium , marks a pivotal moment in its journey. This isn’t merely a price pump; it’s a clear signal of growing institutional confidence and the increasing integration of digital assets into mainstream finance. The insightful CryptoQuant analysis has illuminated the powerful role of US crypto investors , showcasing how their robust demand is shaping the market’s trajectory.

KULR has acquired 90 BTC for ~ 10 million at ~ $108,884 per #bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 291% YTD. As of 7/9/25, we hodl 1021 $BTC acquired for ~ $101 million at ~ $98,627 per bitcoin. $KULR pic.twitter.com/aXyB0AABsr — Michael Mo (@michaelmokulr) July 10, 2025 In a press release shared with CryptoNews, the firm said with additional bitcoin purchases totaling approximately $10 million, KULR now holds 1,021 BTC, valued at about $101 million. The latest acquisitions were made at a weighted average price of $108,884 per bitcoin, including fees and expenses. This move is in line with the company’s Bitcoin Treasury Strategy, first announced on December 4, 2024, under which up to 90% of its surplus cash reserves are allocated to bitcoin. KULR joins a growing list of companies that have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a treasury strategy. This includes MicroStrategy, a business intelligence firm and one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin. BTC Yield Emerges as Key Performance Indicator A core component of KULR’s strategy is its proprietary metric: BTC Yield. This figure, which reached 291.2% year to date, measures the percentage increase in the ratio of bitcoin holdings to Assumed Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding. According to the firm it intends to reflect the effectiveness of the company’s bitcoin acquisition tactics. Complementary metrics include BTC Gain (633 BTC), BTC Dollar Gain ($70.3 million), and a multiple of Net Asset Value (mNAV) currently at 2.24. KULR notes these metrics are designed to capture the value-accretive nature of its treasury operations, rather than serve as traditional financial indicators. Cautions on Interpreting BTC Metrics While BTC Yield offers insight into KULR’s Bitcoin-centric strategy, the company cautions that it should not be considered a proxy for earnings performance or liquidity. It excludes liabilities and does not reflect overall financial health. KULR said that its stock price is influenced by a broader set of variables beyond bitcoin holdings. Investors are advised to use BTC Yield as a supplemental tool and refer to the company’s full financial statements and SEC filings for a comprehensive view of its position, says the firm. KULR Price Action – Modest Gain KULR Technology is trading at $6.58 today, up 2%, reflecting modest intraday gains. KULR continues to show investor confidence, supported by its Bitcoin-driven narrative and endorsements by analysts. That said, it remains a volatile, technically uncertain stock. KULR Boosts Mining Capacity with New Deployment in Paraguay This month KULR said it has also deployed 3,570 Bitmain S19 XP 140T Bitcoin mining machines in Asuncion, Paraguay, raising its total mining capacity to 750 PH/s across multiple sites. $KULR Technology recently announced our deployment of 3570 Bitmain Miners, located in Paraguay.
