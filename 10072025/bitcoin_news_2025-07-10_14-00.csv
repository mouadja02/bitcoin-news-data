2025-07-10T11:50:18,"ETH futures displace BTC volume as traders shift sentiment toward Ethereum","Trader focus is shifting, causing one of the rare occasions when Ethereum futures activity outpaces BTC. The trade signals a shift in sentiment, breaking the streak of ETH being considered an underperforming asset. Trader focus is shifting toward Ethereum, as ETH futures volumes overtook Bitcoin. BTC returned to its spot as the leader soon after, but the increased trading signals a shift for ETH sentiment and a possible trader rotation. #Ethereum just flipped #Bitcoin in 24h futures volume: $62.1B vs $61.7B! That’s rare – and it signals a potential rotation in trader focus and positioning ahead of possible $ETH -specific catalysts. pic.twitter.com/34XlbZgimQ — glassnode (@glassnode) July 10, 2025 Based on Glassnode data , ETH futures expanded to $62.1B for 24-hour volumes, while BTC achieved $61.7B. ETH volumes soon slowed down to $61.7B for the day, still close behind BTC. Liquidations were also more active for Ethereum based on the current trader positioning. Spot volumes for ETH are at around $28B per day, with $40B for BTC. The leading coin still dominates the market, with over $34B in open interest and around $18B for ETH. While BTC open interest remained largely unchanged, ETH positions nearly doubled from recent lows, showing traders have not capitulated. ETH recovers $2,800, still unable to make a bigger move The next step for Ethereum may include factors specific to the chain, especially DeFi growth and stablecoin traffic. For now, ETH managed to break above $2,800, but is yet to show additional strength to recover above $3,000. ETH traded at $2,777.40, after taking a step backward. In the past week, ETH recovered against BTC, rising to 0.025 BTC. However, for the year to date, ETH lost 29% of its value against BTC. A shift in sentiment may anticipate a trend reversal, where ETH activity increases to tap a more dramatic price move. One of the potential scenarios includes gaining against BTC, or a hike to the $3,000 or $4,000 level. However, ETH currently sees most of its derivative liquidity in long positions, starting at around $2,600. The recent rally may reverse to liquidate those positions. Based on trader positioning on Binance, ETH has mostly finished liquidating the long positions. In the past 24 hours, traders were liquidated for $157.9M in short positions. Following the large daily liquidation event, traders turned to attacking long positions. Ethereum may see renewed buying pressure Until recently, ETH fell due to combined selling pressure from whales and from the reserves of Grayscale . Recently, Grayscale started re-accumulating ETH, along with other funds. ETH is also accumulating in whale wallets with 10,000 or more tokens. Mega-whale wallets now hold over 41M ETH, after months of slow and mostly invisible accumulation. Around 30% of the ETH supply is staked in the Beacon Chain contract. Ethereum is also getting accumulated in corporate treasuries, following a similar path to BTC. In any case, ETH is seen as valuable and as the central chain for decentralized finance and stablecoins. The expectations for an ETH rally may also reawaken altcoins , leading to a breakout season in the second half of 2025. The Ethereum narrative is also abandoning the recent capitulation and the expectations that the chain will be useless and abandoned. Ethereum remains a DeFi lending leader, compensating for the loss of meme tokens, gaming tokens and other Web3 trends from the 2021 bull market.

2025-07-10T11:50:17,"Bhutan Bitcoin Strategy: Unveiling a Pivotal $23.61M BTC Transfer to Binance","A ripple of intrigue has spread through the cryptocurrency world. Just moments ago, the Royal Government of Bhutan executed a significant Bitcoin transfer, moving 212.31 BTC, valued at an astonishing $23.61 million, to the global exchange giant Binance. This isn’t an isolated incident; over the past ten days, Bhutan has consistently channeled its digital assets, depositing a total of 350.74 BTC worth approximately $38.5 million into the exchange. This latest move by the Himalayan kingdom spotlights a unique approach to digital asset management and prompts us to delve deeper into Bhutan’s fascinating Bhutan Bitcoin Strategy . Unpacking Bhutan’s Unique Bhutan Bitcoin Strategy For many, the idea of a sovereign nation actively managing a substantial Bitcoin portfolio might seem surprising. Yet, Bhutan, a country often associated with its Gross National Happiness philosophy and pristine natural beauty, has quietly emerged as a pioneering force in the realm of state-sponsored cryptocurrency adoption. Their journey into Bitcoin isn’t new; reports suggest they began mining Bitcoin as early as 2019, leveraging their abundant hydropower resources – a clean, sustainable energy source perfectly suited for energy-intensive mining operations. The nation’s digital asset ventures are primarily managed by Druk Holdings and Investments (DHI), the commercial arm of the Royal Government. DHI acts as a sovereign wealth fund, holding and managing the government’s assets across various sectors, including energy, communication, and now, digital currencies. This strategic diversification into Bitcoin is seen not just as an investment but as a long-term play to future-proof the nation’s economy and explore new revenue streams. Sustainable Mining: Utilizing surplus hydropower for eco-friendly Bitcoin mining. Sovereign Wealth Management: DHI integrates Bitcoin into its diversified portfolio. Long-Term Vision: A forward-thinking approach to national economic resilience. Understanding the Broader Landscape of Government Crypto Holdings Bhutan is not alone in its exploration of digital assets, though its quiet, strategic approach sets it apart. The concept of government crypto holdings has gained significant traction globally, driven by various motivations: Country/Entity Motivation for Crypto Holdings Examples El Salvador National Currency, Remittances, Tourism Made Bitcoin legal tender, launched Volcano Bonds. Ukraine War Funding, Humanitarian Aid Accepted crypto donations during conflict. United States Seized Assets, Law Enforcement Holds large amounts of BTC from illicit activities. Various Nations Innovation, Reserves, Diversification Exploring CBDCs, holding small amounts for research. While some nations, like El Salvador, have made bold public statements about their Bitcoin adoption, others, like Bhutan, have preferred a more discreet, calculated path. This highlights a growing trend where governments are no longer just regulating crypto but are actively participating in the digital asset ecosystem, albeit with varying degrees of transparency and strategic intent. However, holding significant amounts of volatile assets like Bitcoin comes with its own set of challenges. These include: Price Volatility: The inherent price swings of Bitcoin can impact portfolio value. Security Concerns: Safeguarding large digital holdings from hacks and cyber threats. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies. Public Perception: Managing public and international opinion on state-backed crypto ventures. The Implications of a Large Bitcoin Exchange Transfer to Binance The recent movement of 212.31 BTC, following previous deposits, directly to Binance, a major centralized exchange, is a particularly noteworthy aspect of Bhutan’s recent activity. A large Bitcoin exchange transfer like this can signal several possibilities: Liquidity Needs: The government might be preparing to sell a portion of its holdings to fund national projects, diversify into other assets, or manage its treasury. Moving funds to an exchange makes them readily available for trading. Portfolio Rebalancing: DHI might be rebalancing its portfolio, perhaps reducing its Bitcoin exposure or shifting funds to other digital assets supported by Binance. Custodial Services: While less likely for such large amounts if the intent is long-term holding, it could indicate a shift in custodial strategy, though self-custody is often preferred for sovereign entities. Market Signal: Large transfers to exchanges are often watched by traders as they can precede selling pressure, though the overall market impact from Bhutan’s moves might be limited given Bitcoin’s vast liquidity. Binance, as the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, offers deep liquidity and a wide range of trading pairs, making it a logical choice for executing large transactions. The decision to use a centralized exchange rather than over-the-counter (OTC) desks could imply a need for immediate liquidity or a preference for the exchange’s specific features. Leveraging On-chain Analytics to Track Bhutan’s BTC Movement The ability to track such significant transactions stems from the inherent transparency of the Bitcoin blockchain. This is where on-chain analytics plays a crucial role. Tools and platforms, like Onchain Lens on X (formerly Twitter), analyze publicly available blockchain data to identify and interpret large movements of digital assets. How do on-chain analysts track these movements? Public Ledger: Every Bitcoin transaction is recorded on a public, immutable ledger. Address Tracing: Analysts identify wallets associated with known entities (like governments or large institutions) and track funds moving from these addresses. Exchange Wallets: Major exchanges have identifiable “hot” and “cold” wallets. When funds move into these, it’s often a precursor to trading activity. Volume and Frequency: Large, frequent transfers to exchanges are flagged as significant events, indicating potential market-moving actions. This transparency is a double-edged sword for governments. While it allows for public accountability and verifiable transactions, it also exposes their financial movements to global scrutiny. For Bhutan, this means their strategic decisions in the crypto space are open for interpretation by the wider market and crypto community. What’s Next for Bhutan’s Digital Asset Journey? The recent Bhutan BTC movement to Binance raises questions about the kingdom’s future plans for its digital assets. Will we see further divestment, or is this merely a tactical repositioning? Given Bhutan’s measured approach, it’s unlikely to be a hasty decision. Instead, it likely reflects a calculated step within their broader economic strategy. Possible future scenarios include: Continued Portfolio Management: Regular rebalancing and optimization of their digital asset holdings based on market conditions and national needs. Diversification Beyond Bitcoin: Exploring other cryptocurrencies or blockchain-based investments that align with their sustainable development goals. Integration into National Economy: Potentially using blockchain technology for land records, supply chain management, or even a national digital currency (CBDC) in the future. Increased Transparency: As Bhutan gains more experience, they might opt for greater transparency regarding their crypto strategy, potentially inspiring other nations. Bhutan’s journey serves as a compelling case study for how a small nation can strategically engage with the rapidly evolving world of digital finance. Their blend of environmental consciousness with technological foresight offers valuable lessons for other governments considering similar ventures. Conclusion: Bhutan’s Bold Digital Horizon The Royal Government of Bhutan’s recent significant Bitcoin transfers to Binance underscore its pioneering role in state-level crypto adoption. Far from a fleeting experiment, Bhutan’s Bhutan Bitcoin Strategy , rooted in sustainable energy and long-term vision, positions it as a quiet leader in the digital asset space. These movements, meticulously tracked through on-chain analytics , highlight the growing importance of government crypto holdings and the strategic implications of a large Bitcoin exchange transfer . As the world watches, Bhutan continues to navigate the complexities of digital finance with a unique blend of prudence and innovation, setting a compelling precedent for sovereign engagement with the future of money.

The decentralized prediction platform Kalshi says that based on the price of recent trades, the US national debt is now forecasted to grow from about $36 trillion to $46 trillion by 2029. The site has also added a live US debt tracker to its website. “Both Democrats and Republicans have failed to curb government spending… Now you can watch the national debt grow live on Kalshi.” The Kobeissi Letter, a newsletter about global markets, says that if the US debt reaches $46 trillion, it would be “officially up +100% since 2020” and warns of dire consequences. “On our current fiscal path, US bankruptcy is simply a matter of time. Something must change.” Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, has also been warning of severe economic and financial consequences as the US national debt is now on pace to rise from about $230,000 per American household to $425,000 per American household over the next decade. Dalio believes the remedy is to cut spending and raise taxes to lower the annual deficit to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio. “This printing and devaluing is not good for those holding bonds as a storehold of wealth, and what’s bad for bonds and US credit markets is bad for everyone because the US Treasury market is the backbone of all capital markets, which are the backbones of our economic and social conditions. Unless this path is soon rectified to bring the budget deficit from roughly 7% of GDP to about 3% by making adjustments to spending, taxes, and interest rates, big, painful disruptions will likely occur.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-10T11:44:40,"RCADE Network down 30% a day after Binance Alpha and Bitget listings","RCADE, the native token of the Arbitrum Layer 3 gaming-focused RCADE Network, experienced a sharp price drop following its listing on major cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance Alpha and Bitget. On July 9, RCADE was officially listed on Binance Alpha, Binance’s early-access listing portal, marking the token’s TGE. It was quickly followed by spot listings on Gate.io, KuCoin, Bithumb, and Bitget. Despite the high-profile rollout, RCADE faced sharp downward pressure in the immediate aftermath. Following its TGE, RCADE opened at an initial price of $0.0029 but declined by more than 30%, hitting an intraday low of $0.0018 on July 10. The sharp sell-off is consistent with a broader pattern seen in early-stage token launches, where airdrop recipients and early unlocks trigger short-term selling pressure. Notably, 19.38% of RCADE’s total 40 billion token supply was designated for community initiatives, such as airdrops and incentive programs, most of which were fully unlocked at launch, increasing circulating supply and likely contributing to the immediate price drop. Despite the initial decline, RCADE has since shown signs of recovery. As of the latest available data, the token rebounded to $0.0020, suggesting that market participants with long-term confidence in the project’s fundamentals are beginning to accumulate. You might also like: BREAKING: Bitcoin price hits record high as ETF demand overwhelms bearish market setup Such a recovery shows that some investors are still hopeful about the project, viewing the sell-off as a temporary market reaction rather than a reflection of the project’s long-term viability. In contrast to RCADE’s volatile debut, Tanssi Network (TANSSI), which was also listed on Binance Alpha on the same day, managed to sustain gains of over 25% as of press time. What is RCADE Network? RCADE Network is a custom Arbitrum Layer 3 gaming infrastructure developed by Revolving Games, a Web3 studio known for titles like War of Nova and Skyborne: Phoenix Flight. Purpose-built for seamless GameFi experiences, RCADE enables low-cost, high-speed in-game transactions across its interconnected ecosystem. RCADE serves as the utility and governance token of the network, powering validator staking, node emissions, gameplay rewards, and protocol-level governance. The token is also used for in-game purchases and ecosystem fees. Read more: Solana at critical decision point: will SOL breakout to $176 or tumble to $131?

2025-07-10T11:43:14,"Data of 27,000 Bitcoin Depot customers exposed in massive breach","The crypto ATM operator kept the leak quiet for over a year, citing federal procedures and law enforcement investigations. According to a recent filing with the Maine Attorney General’s office, the breach was first detected on June 23, 2024, when Bitcoin Depot identified suspicious activity on its information systems. The firm deployed an investigation in response, engaging third-party security experts to determine the extent of the breach. On July 18, 2024, the investigation confirmed that a hacker had accessed documents containing the personal data of 26,732 customers. The stolen information included names, phone numbers, and driver’s license numbers. In some cases, it also included home addresses, birth dates, and email addresses. Bitcoin Depot said it was unable to notify affected users earlier due to an ongoing federal investigation. The disclosure hold was only lifted on June 13, 2025, when law enforcement confirmed that their investigation had concluded. You might also like: US crypto ATM operator Bitcoin Depot adds $5m in BTC to treasury The company emphasized that there is no evidence so far that the exposed data has been misused, and is offering support to affected individuals. It has also implemented new security measures, improved system monitoring, and increased internal awareness to help prevent future incidents. Users are advised to stay vigilant over the next 12 to 24 months and urged to monitor financial accounts, review credit reports, and report any suspicious activity or signs of identity theft immediately. The breach comes amid a wave of targeted attacks on crypto service providers, as threat actors continue to evolve their tactics to prey on unsuspecting individuals and entities. It echoes a similar December 2024 breach on rival crypto ATM operator Byte Federal, which exposed personal data of more than 58,000 users.

Source: Finbold The breakout triggered over $200 million in short liquidations and marked a key technical milestone. According to technical analyst Rich Ross from Evercore, Bitcoin is “coiled like a spring,” with potential upside targets ranging from $140,000 to $170,000. JUST IN: Bitcoin chart is ""coiled like a spring"" with upside to $170,000. pic.twitter.com/c7emsBEOQT — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) July 10, 2025 Bullish momentum was sparked in part by geopolitical events, particularly U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement of sweeping new tariffs. The administration is set to implement up to 40% tariffs on imports from Malaysia, Kazakhstan, South Africa, Myanmar, and Laos, and raise Japan’s tariff rate to 25% starting August 1. As trade tensions rise, Bitcoin continues to solidify its role as a macro hedge and digital store of value. Key BTC technical breakout confirmed Market structure has supported the rally. As noted by analyst Michael van de Poppe in a July 10 chart update, Bitcoin’s price action accelerated sharply after breaking above the $106,500 resistance level, a move that opened the door for price action to reach $108,000 and beyond. Liquidity clusters between $105,000 and $106,500 have been cleared, and the next leg of upward momentum hinges on maintaining support above that zone. https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1943210330487951416 “Liquidity has been taken, slight pullback before the big breakout to ATH,” van de Poppe observed, highlighting the $105,797 region as a key threshold. He also marked sub-$100K as a potential reaccumulation zone in the event of a deeper correction, but overall market sentiment remains strongly bullish. Bitcoin long-term bullish setup This latest all-time high also puts Bitcoin up nearly 90% year-over-year. Notably, while Bitcoin price has reached a new high, the overall crypto market cap remains under its previous peak of $3.73 trillion set in December 2024. Institutional demand remains a major tailwind. Spot ETF flows have continued to rise, and investor appetite shows no signs of slowing. In parallel, the U.S. macro environment, including inflation concerns, rate cut expectations, and now tariff shocks is creating ideal conditions for further Bitcoin strength. As BTC continues to consolidate above $110,000, traders and analysts are watching closely for confirmation of a clean breakout toward $120,000 and beyond.

Brett ( BRETT ) price has surged over 15% in the past 24 hours, currently trading at $0.0512 as it tests the upper trendline resistance of the descending channel it has been trading within since early May. The price has also broken above the 20-day EMA for the first time in weeks, which is a signal of building bullish momentum. This breakout attempt, combined with rising volume, suggests a potential trend reversal may be underway. The current descending channel also appears to be part of a bullish Cup and Handle formation. If BRETT price manages to break and close above the upper boundary of the descending channel — $0.051–$0.052 — it would open the door for a measured move toward $0.85., which corresponds to the height of the channel projected from the breakout point. This level also aligns with the second major swing high within the channel. Source: TradingView You might also like: TRUMP hops to Tron, deepening ties between MAGA memecoins and Justin Sun However, the technical picture becomes even more compelling when the descending channel is seen as the handle of a larger Cup and Handle pattern. Should the price confirm a breakout above the handle, it could set the stage for a larger upside move toward ~$0.148 if the price breaks out of the cup’s rim. The momentum indicators support the bullish case, with the MACD line above signal line, accompanied by a green histogram. The RSI is at 57, indicating moderate bullish momentum without being overbought, leaving room for the price to move higher before hitting resistance levels typically associated with overextension. BRETT’s surge is happening alongside a broader crypto market rally, with Bitcoin ( BTC ) recently hitting a new all-time high just shy of $112,000.

The rally followed a key regulatory milestone: the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officially acknowledged a proposed exchange-traded fund (ETF) that would hold both PENGU tokens and Pudgy Penguins non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The SEC’s notice , issued under Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act, confirmed it is considering Cboe BZX Exchange’s application to list the Canary PENGU ETF. The move has prompted renewed market enthusiasm, reinforcing PENGU’s standing among altcoins with rising institutional exposure. Canary PENGU ETF structure ties tokens and NFTs The proposed Canary PENGU ETF introduces a dual-asset structure that allocates between 80% and 95% of the fund’s holdings to PENGU tokens and 5% to 15% to Pudgy Penguins NFTs. This blend of digital assets offers investors exposure to both the meme coin and its associated NFT collection. Canary Capital first submitted the S1 filing for the fund in March. A follow-up 19b-4 was filed by Cboe BZX on June 25 and later amended twice, with the most recent update filed on July 8. The ETF, if approved, would trade under the Commodity-Based Trust Shares category per Cboe BZX Rule 14.11(e)(4). It represents a rare combination of fungible and non-fungible blockchain assets in a single listed product, a strategy not yet approved for any other altcoin ETF by the SEC. SEC opens public comment window on PENGU ETF Following the acknowledgement, the SEC has now opened a 21-day public comment window, beginning after the filing’s publication in the Federal Register. This phase does not imply approval but is a required step before a final decision can be made. While Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have been cleared under the Trump administration’s more crypto-friendly SEC, no altcoin or meme coin ETF has received formal approval to date. However, the SEC has shown willingness to consider applications, and the PENGU filing is among the few currently under active review. The ETF notice has had a measurable market impact. PENGU’s price spiked immediately following the SEC’s acknowledgement, making it the top daily gainer on CoinGecko at the time of writing. The token’s performance mirrors earlier rallies in March and June, when initial filings triggered similar surges. Technical signals and ETF interest drive sentiment Traders and market watchers have identified a cup-and-handle formation in PENGU’s price chart, a common bullish continuation pattern. This setup suggests the possibility of further gains if resistance levels are broken. PENGU has now emerged as one of the few meme coins with a path to ETF market exposure. The combination of technical bullish signals and a regulatory event has driven investor speculation that the token could become a leader in its category during the current cycle. The price movement also comes amid a broader trend of altcoins attempting to gain institutional legitimacy through regulated products. PENGU’s rally is being closely watched as a potential test case for crypto ETFs that move beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, especially given the inclusion of NFTs in its structure. Though the final outcome of the ETF proposal remains uncertain, the price response highlights growing confidence among retail and institutional investors in tokenised products that link fungible and non-fungible digital assets.

A notable aspect is the futures market activity. Glassnode analysts noted a rare event where Ethereum’s 24-hour futures volume of $62.1 billion surpassed Bitcoin’s $61.7 billion. Per the platform, this signals potential rotation and may precede ETH-specific catalysts. If bulls continue higher, ETH could break to its all-time high above $4k.

2025-07-10T11:15:00,"Ether, AI Coins Steal Bitcoin’s Spotlight: Crypto Daybook Americas","By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Everyone’s buzzing about bitcoin (BTC) finally catching a bid, setting record prices on several exchanges and igniting bullish excitement. But don't let the spotlight on BTC cast AI coins into the shadow. Major tokens supposedly associated with artificial intelligence, such as TAO, ICP, RENDER and FET, surged as much as 8% in the past 24 hours, outpacing even the 10 largest coins by market cap. The catalyst is chipmaker Nvidia, a bellwether for all things AI, which rallied to a market valuation of $4 trillion on Wednesday, the first time any company has achieved this milestone. ""The size and success of this giant, and the other US tech behemoths, underscores how much the AI trade can overwhelm the market's response to week-to-week fluctuations in economic data and policy headlines,"" Lisa Abramowicz, co-host of Bloomberg Surveillance, said on X . In other words, the AI sub-sector of the crypto market could get really hot. Let's turn to ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, which also outshone the No. 1 coin yesterday amid record trading volumes in BlackRock's spot ether ETF. The rally followed Fidelity’s latest report , which highlighted the Ethereum blockchain's lead over Solana and other programmable chains in terms of developer activity, total value locked (TVL) and stablecoin use. The report emphasized ether's dual role as both a medium of exchange and a store of value — narratives that have worked in bitcoin's favor for years. In other news, PUMP, the official token of Pump.fun, traded 40% above its upcoming ICO price, while FART, VIRTUAL, and PENGU have each logged double-digit gains. SHIB appeared poised to outperform BTC, but continued to trade on a weak footing against its rival, DOGE. Finally, macroeconomic factors necessitated that traders prepare for volatility. As QCP Capital astutely put it: “With a reignited trade war, a hawkish Federal Reserve, and tightening liquidity, volatility is likely to spike. Macro catalysts are lining up—so buckle up for a wild ride.” Stay alert.

The PUMP-USD perpetual contract went live on July 9 following community requests and offers up to 3x leverage. In its first 24 hours, the contract saw $30 million in trading volume, indicating strong interest despite the token not yet being live on-chain. Open interest on Hyperliquid stood at over $17 million during Asian morning hours on July 10. Activity is expected to rise further as Binance Futures introduces its own PUMP perpetual contract at 07:30 UTC today. The token sale will distribute 33% of the total 1 trillion supply, with 18% already allocated in a private round and 15% set for the public sale. Both tranches are priced at $0.004 and will be fully unlocked at launch. The project is marketing PUMP as more than a meme token — positioning it as the foundation for a decentralized Web3-native social platform that rivals TikTok, Twitch and Facebook by rewarding users with financial benefits instead of just engagement. Since its rise in early 2024, Pump.fun has played a central role in Solana’s memecoin boom, offering frictionless token launches and capturing over $600 million in protocol revenue, largely from trading and launch fees. Derivatives Positioning BTC and ETH funding rates on offshore perpetual exchanges are holding below annualized 10% despite price rallies, indicating little signs of overheating. Ether perpetual futures open interest climbed for a fourth straight day, hitting a tally of 5.46 million ETH. Funding rates for XRP, DOGE, ADA, HYPE and SUI topped the 10% mark, indicating a growing interest in long positions. On the CME, three-month basis in BTC futures bounced slightly to 8% from 5% early this month, but overall activity remains subdued. On Deribit, BTC and ETH call skews strengthened across tenors. However, front-end options show relatively stronger call skew. That's a sign of under-positioned traders panic buying with the price rise. OTC network Paradigm reported mixed block flows in BTC options, featuring risk reversals and put spreads. Traders bought ETH topside across tenors from July to December.

BTC vs gold market cap: 9.47% Technical Analysis The BTC breakout from the counter-trend channel, although encouraging, still warrants caution as prices remain below the May high of around $112K. A firm move above that level is needed to cement bullish expectations, opening doors for $115K, the long-term trendline hurdle. The positive MACD histogram supports the bull case. Still, traders need to be vigilant for a renewed weakness here as that would likely strengthen the double top narrative, leading to a self-fulfilling decline.

This represents a 23% increase in holdings quarter over quarter and covers 4% of bitcoin’s total capped supply of 21 million BTC. The average bitcoin price climbed to $107,754, which drove a significant 61% boost in portfolio value compared to Q1.

2025-07-10T11:00:59,"‘Real’ Crypto Bull Run Just Beginning, Says Analyst—Here’s Why","In a livestream broadcast on X, independent market technician Kevin, known online as @Kev_Capital_TA, argued that crypto markets are only now entering what he called “the real bull run,” pointing to a confluence of technical signals, macroeconomic data and inter-market correlations that he believes have not been fully appreciated by traders. The Real Bull Run Starts Here Kevin placed particular emphasis on the behavior of Tether dominance (USDT.D), the share of crypto market capitalization held in the dollar-pegged stablecoin. The analyst displayed two long-term logarithmic USDT.D charts, each showing an initial sharp decline followed by what he described as a “rising channel slash bear flag.” In both 2024 and the present structure, the measured-move target of the pattern sits at 3.70 percent. “It’s really astonishing how this is kind of attempting to play out,” he said, stressing that any sustainable rally in risk assets will require that level to be reached. “The two key words that are going to be the most important words over the next couple of weeks are follow through.” Related Reading: Crypto Market Cap On Track To $4.5 Trillion As Q3 Unfolds – Details He then overlaid a macro descending triangle on a separate two-week USDT.D chart dating back to March 2020. Each time the two-week Stochastic RSI crossed downward, the dominance metric fell sharply, coinciding with periods of strength in Bitcoin and altcoins. The latest cross, now curling lower, again targets 3.70 percent. If that support were to give way, Kevin allowed, a deeper slide toward “the two-percent handle” could mark a “peak bull market” phase—though he cautioned against speculating that far ahead. The technical discussion broadened to Bitcoin’s hash-ribbon indicator, which tracks miner capitulation and recovery. Historically, weekly “buy” signals have preceded 40 to 100 percent upside moves within nine weeks, with what Kevin called a “100 percent hit rate” over eight years of back-testing. Kevin linked the on-chain data to macro conditions. Citing the real-time inflation gauge “Truthflation,” he highlighted a 1.66 percent reading—below the Federal Reserve’s nominal 2 percent target—and falling import prices, both of which, he argued, increase the odds of an imminent shift to easier policy. “If Truthflation stays below 2 percent, you’re going to get the easing you want,” he said, predicting that markets would price in an end to quantitative tightening ahead of any official announcement. “Retail traders are becoming more educated than they’ve ever been.… The market will sniff out rate cuts coming.” Altcoin capital rotation formed a second pillar of the bullish thesis. Ethereum’s market-share chart, he said, had been basing at 2019-2020 lows, with monthly MACD, Stochastic RSI and Market Cipher signals all turning up. Early reallocations into ETH-beta names such as Chainlink and Uniswap are already “up 60 percent” from their accumulation zones, he claimed, framing the moves as the foothills of a broader run. Nonetheless, he warned viewers not to wait for central-bank confirmation: “Don’t be the person sitting on the sidelines waiting for Powell to come out saying QT is over.” Related Reading: XRP Set To Shock The Crypto Market With 30% Share, Analyst Predicts Turning to Bitcoin itself, Kevin acknowledged that the benchmark still faces substantial resistance. Price must clear the March record, then the $112,000–$116,000 range and, ultimately, $120,000 before “thin air” opens a path to $140,000–$150,000. Similarly, the “total three” index—market cap excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum—needs a daily close above $877 billion and, crucially, the yellow-shaded resistance band that has capped rallies five times since February. Only then, he argued, would a new all-time high for the broader alt-basket come into view. Despite the optimism, Kevin repeatedly returned to the notion that conviction without confirmation is premature. “We need to see real deal price action,” he said, noting that Bitcoin’s daily RSI has not reached the 90-plus “euphoria” zone since 2017. He called the post-March tape “down-trending crappy price action” and insisted that any declaration of a full-fledged cycle peak must await multiple days of decisive follow-through. In closing, the analyst underscored the time sensitivity of the opportunity. With the halving behind and the traditional four-year cycle ostensibly entering its final phase, “you’ve got five to six months of what should be elite-level price action,” he said. Whether or not the textbook cycle ends on schedule will depend, in his view, on the interaction between a Federal Reserve pivot and the crypto market’s ability to anticipate it. For now, Kevin’s roadmap is unambiguous: monitor USDT dominance for a breakdown toward 3.70 percent, watch for successive hash-ribbon buy signals, and demand momentum “follow through” above the identified technical hurdles. If those conditions are met, he contends, the rally that many traders thought was already under way will reveal itself as only the warm-up act for “the real bull run.” At press time, BTC traded at $111,250.

Solana coin price could reach a potential high of $400 in 2025. With a potential surge, the SOL price could hit $1,351 by 2030. Solana is coming true to its community-claimed title, “Ethereum-Killer,” as it gradually surpasses Ethereum in the decentralized market. In a recent feat, Solana ETFs have been gaining traction. Talking about numbers, the Solana price currently trades at a discount of 46.38% from its ATH of $ 294.33. Following this, crypto investors are storming Google with questions like “Will Solana Go Back Up?” or “How high can Solana go?” and “Will SOL price reach $500 this altcoin season?” To answer more such questions, we bring to you our latest Solana price prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030. We’ll address these queries using our analyses, market sentiments, and regular updates from the crypto world. Table of contents Story Highlights Solana Price Today Solana Price Prediction for July 2025 Solana (SOL) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Solana Price Forecast 2026 SOL Price Analysis 2027 Solana Coin Price Prediction 2028 SOL Coin Price Prediction 2029 Solana Price Prediction 2030 Solana (SOL) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Market Analysis FAQs Solana Price Today Cryptocurrency Solana Token SOL Price $ 157.82168287 3.04% Market cap $ 84,548,257,334.0259 Circulating Supply 535,720,160.8600 Trading Volume $ 4,865,189,985.8923 All-time high $294.33 on 19th January 2025 All-time low $0.5052 on 12th May 2020 Solana Price Prediction for July 2025 Solana short-term price prediction suggests limited upside unless momentum improves. With RSI at 57.38 and price trading above the 20-day SMA at $148.56, SOL shows consolidation signs. The Bollinger Bands indicate a potential range, with the lower bound at $133, suggesting a potential low of $130. If bulls reclaim the 20-day SMA, the average price may hover around $150, and in a bullish breakout, the potential high could reach $165. Overall, price action remains range-bound barring major volume inflows. Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July $130 $150 $165 Solana Price Prediction 2025 As per CoinGlass , Solana leads the crypto derivatives market with a massive $6.94 billion in open interest, far outpacing all other tokens. This indicates strong trader confidence and sustained capital inflow into SOL positions. Other notable projects like FARTCOIN, LINK, and UNI trail behind with open interest between $750M–$540M. The dominance of SOL on both the treemap and bar chart suggests it remains a favorite among leveraged traders, potentially fueling heightened volatility and price action in the near term. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250. Considering the present market sentiment, the SOL crypto could settle with an average trading price of around $325.

2025-07-10T10:57:20,"XRP News Today: Market Analysts Pivot to Bitcoin Solaris as Next Major Wealth Creator","The post XRP News Today: Market Analysts Pivot to Bitcoin Solaris as Next Major Wealth Creator appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News For years, XRP has been the underdog with a loyal fanbase and a knack for surviving regulatory storms. But lately, whispers in the crypto corridors are shifting. There’s a new name popping up on analyst radars, and it’s not just another coin chasing hype. It’s Bitcoin Solaris. And if you’re still holding onto 2017 dreams, this might be the moment you pivot to something built for 2025 and beyond. XRP’s Strength and Its Silent Plateau Let’s be clear. XRP still holds weight. It’s fast, has real-world partnerships, and sits comfortably in the top ten. Its legal victories brought a wave of optimism. But even die-hard XRP holders admit: that the explosive growth days may be behind it. The market wants fresh narratives, fresh infrastructure, and above all, fresh money. That’s where Bitcoin Solaris is stepping in with boots on fire. Enter Bitcoin Solaris: The New Standard Bitcoin Solaris, or BTC-S , isn’t just throwing around promises. It’s launching with serious technical muscle and a mission to reshape how people build wealth in crypto. Forget the tech-for-tech’s-sake attitude. BTC-S is built with purpose. Here’s why it’s getting analyst attention: Dual-layer blockchain: One layer for rock-solid Proof of Work security. The other, blazing-fast DPoS that delivers finality in 2 seconds. A hybrid Helios Consensus engine that rotates validators, protects against forks, and handles up to 100,000 transactions per second without burning energy. Built-in smart contract support using Rust, opening doors to enterprise-grade DeFi, cross-chain bridges, and real-world utility. This isn’t a copy-paste from another chain. It’s a purpose-built machine for the next generation of adoption. It’s also fully audited by both Cyberscope and Freshcoins , which is giving investors even more confidence in the code and mechanics. Even influencers like Token Galaxy are highlighting why this isn’t just another flashy launch. It’s a system being built with long-term vision. Mining from Your Pocket Imagine earning daily, not by plugging in bulky GPUs, but by using your phone. Bitcoin Solaris makes that a reality with the upcoming Solaris Nova App. Through its energy-efficient algorithm and mobile-first approach, anyone can participate in mining. This isn’t just “tap to earn” fluff. BTC-S mining adjusts to device capability and energy settings, making it ideal for global adoption. You can even run calculations with their mining calculator to estimate daily returns based on your hardware. And yes, it’s accessible to anyone, anytime. Whether you’re mining while commuting or during a coffee break, BTC-S is democratizing crypto creation in a way Bitcoin never could. Not Just Scalable Designed to Be Unstoppable That’s BTC-S Staking Reinvented with Liquidity in Mind Unlike traditional staking, which often feels like locking your tokens in a vault and throwing away the key, Bitcoin Solaris introduces liquid staking. This model converts staked BTC-S into sBTC-S at a 1:1 ratio, giving holders liquidity and utility. Key benefits include: Earn rewards while your tokens remain usable. Use sBTC-S in lending, DeFi, or simply hold and trade. Fully integrated with the Solaris Nova App and managed through automated validator rotation. It’s staking without compromise. And for those wanting more details, the full feature breakdown is available here . The Presale Surge: Price, Power, and a Pivot Bitcoin Solaris is currently in Phase 11 of its presale, holding at $11. The launch price is set at $20, giving early adopters a clean 150% upside potential. Already over $6.6 million has been raised with more than 14,150 unique buyers participating. But here’s the real twist. A temporary Price Rollback has been announced. For a short window, users can buy in at $5 instead of $11. This is not a discount or bonus. It’s a rare flash opportunity for those watching closely and acting fast. With only around 3 weeks left before launch, it’s no surprise this presale is being called one of the shortest and most aggressive in the market. To receive your tokens on launch day, Bitcoin Solaris recommends using Trust Wallet or Metamask . These wallets ensure smooth delivery and hassle-free token access when the platform goes live. A Wealth Engine, Not Just a Blockchain From mobile mining to flexible staking, high-throughput smart contracts to energy-conscious consensus, Bitcoin Solaris is not just another Ethereum clone or Bitcoin fork. It’s a hybrid beast with utility, accessibility, and financial upside built into every corner. It’s also one of the few crypto projects blending deep technical sophistication with broad market access, making it not just investable but actually usable. Oh, and yes, the team is verified.

2025-07-10T10:53:51,"Bhutan government wallets move BTC in likely profit taking at new ATH","The Royal Government of Bhutan has moved over $23 million worth of Bitcoin to Binance, just as Bitcoin breached its previous all-time high level to trade above $112,000. According to blockchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence, Bhutan’s sovereign investment arm, Druk Holding and Investments (DHI), transferred 213.5 BTC, valued at $23.73 million, to a Binance deposit address on Wednesday. It is the second week in a row that the nation has made a significant transfer to the exchange, likely to sell. The transactions came at a time when Bitcoin hit $112,052 after seven weeks of consolidating between $105,000-$111,000. According to Coingecko data, the largest coin by market cap recorded over $60 billion in global trading volume in the last 24 hours. Bhutan week-on-week portfolio gains Arkham’s tracking data shows that Bhutan’s overall crypto portfolio rose to $1.304 billion on July 10, up from $1.26 billion a week earlier. The government’s net gain over that period stood at $38.4 million, largely due to a week of bullish market conditions that saw most coins trade in the green. As of July 3, the government held 11.93K BTC valued at $1.26 billion, with each coin priced at roughly $105,690. By July 10, Bitcoin’s value had climbed to $111,268, pushing the total value of Bhutan’s holdings to $1.3 billion. Royal Government of Bhutan holdings. Source: Arkham Intelligence The amount of Bitcoin held is still the same, indicating that while 213.5 BTC was sent to Binance, additional BTC might have been mined or moved between internal wallets. Other assets in Bhutan’s portfolio include 656 Ethereum, which increased in value from $1.58 million to $1.71 million after prices rose from $2,405 to $2,791.53 during the same period. Bhutan still recorded an appreciation of over $130,000 in valuation without increasing or reducing its ETH holdings. Several smaller assets in Bhutan’s wallet also registered meager gains. These include AIKEK, whose value rose from $43.33 to $50.68, and KIBSHI, which increased from $116 to $165. BOBO, a memecoin with 69 million units held, gained around $3.60 in valuation during the week. The government expanded its mining footprint in 2023 through a partnership with Singapore-based mining firm Bitdeer. Together, they launched a 600-megawatt mining facility in Gedu, located on the grounds of a failed $1 billion education infrastructure project. Old wallets move holdings to exchanges: More profit-taking? The government’s recent BTC wallet activity comes against the backdrop of several long-dormant Bitcoin wallets moving their holdings to exchanges. On-chain data from CryptoQuant revealed that older Bitcoin holdings, dormant for seven to ten years, have started to move, which analysts call an indicator of profit-taking. Just last week, two wallets from the Satoshi era moved 20,000 BTC valued at $2.18 billion. These coins had not been touched in 14 years. Moreover, derivatives market data from Binance showed there was an uptick in short liquidations and leveraged buying activity during Bitcoin’s rally past $112,000. Net Taker Volume measured by a seven-hour moving average has exceeded the $100 million mark. Bitcoin Net Taker Volume: Source: CryptoQuant Much of the trading volume may have been driven by forced market buys after short sellers were liquidated, and their open positions were converted into buy orders that pushed prices upward. Binance’s perpetual futures funding rate also spiked to +0.01 percent, the highest level seen since late June. The funding rate is the cost of holding long versus short positions in perpetual contracts, and its acceleration on the upside could mean there’s more demand for leveraged long exposure at current market conditions.

2025-07-10T10:51:56,"Analyst Says Altcoins Will Pump Hard if Bitcoin Drops Below This Level","A recent tweet by crypto update platform Ash Crypto has highlighted the current technical state of Bitcoin’s dominance in the overall cryptocurrency market. In the tweet, Ash Crypto stated , “BITCOIN DOMINANCE IS FORMING BEARISH PATTERN AND IF IT DROPS BELOW 65% ALTCOINS WILL PUMP HARD.” This statement was accompanied by a technical chart indicating a visible descending triangle pattern, often interpreted by analysts as a bearish formation in market structure. The attached chart shows Bitcoin’s market cap dominance hovering at approximately 65.08%, down slightly by 0.18%. The pattern includes lower highs and horizontal support along the 65% level, forming a descending triangle that has historically indicated a higher probability of a breakdown when it appears at the top of an uptrend. The dominance chart covers a 4-hour timeframe and illustrates a consolidation structure that appears to be nearing its critical breakout or breakdown point. A break below the horizontal support trendline may signal a shift in market sentiment from Bitcoin toward altcoins. BITCOIN DOMINANCE IS FORMING BEARISH PATTERN AND IF IT DROPS BELOW 65% ALTCOINS WILL PUMP HARD pic.twitter.com/fHc2HN0dmR — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) July 8, 2025 Community Analysts Highlight Technical Breakdown and Altcoin Implications Commentators on the tweet echoed the technical implications suggested by Ash Crypto. Isabella Moreira emphasized the significance of the 65% threshold, stating , “This breakdown in BTC dominance is technically significant. If the 65% level fails, we could see major capital rotation into altcoins. Altseason might be closer than most think.” Her view aligns with the broader market interpretation that declining Bitcoin dominance typically corresponds with a rise in the relative value of altcoins , as capital shifts away from Bitcoin and into other digital assets. Another market observer, Reijer, noted the technical structure as a “descending triangle,” explaining that this pattern “in most cases… will break out to the downside.” He added, “That would be very bullish for ALTs indeed,” reinforcing the sentiment that altcoin markets stand to benefit from a breakdown in Bitcoin dominance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Implications of a Drop Below 65% The 65% level in Bitcoin market dominance has historically acted as a strong support zone. A decisive drop below this threshold would likely signal a redistribution of market value away from Bitcoin , providing upward momentum to altcoins. Such a shift often coincides with increased volatility in mid-cap and low-cap cryptocurrencies, driven by investor speculation and capital rotation strategies. If Bitcoin dominance falls below the 65% mark, it could serve as a technical confirmation of the start of a new phase of altcoin performance. Traders and investors tracking market rotation typically interpret declining BTC dominance as a potential precursor to an altseason, a market period where altcoins significantly outperform Bitcoin in terms of price gains. Ash Crypto’s analysis highlights a bearish pattern forming in Bitcoin dominance, with multiple technical signals suggesting an impending breakdown below the key 65% level. Observers like Isabella Moreira and Reijer support this outlook with their commentary, reinforcing the idea that the altcoin market may soon gain momentum. As the descending triangle nears its apex, market participants will be closely watching the behavior of Bitcoin dominance around this critical support to assess whether altcoins will enter a sustained period of growth.

2025-07-10T10:50:56,"Bitcoin: Unprecedented Surge Sees 125 Publicly Traded Companies Hold $91B in Q2","Are you ready for a seismic shift in the financial landscape? The latest data reveals a groundbreaking trend: corporate Bitcoin adoption is not just a buzzword, it’s a rapidly accelerating reality. As of June 30, a staggering 125 publicly traded companies globally have amassed a combined 847,000 Bitcoin (BTC). This monumental figure represents 4.03% of Bitcoin’s total supply, valued at an astounding $91 billion. What’s even more remarkable? The second quarter of 2025 alone saw these firms add a record 159,000 BTC, with 46 new companies joining the ranks of corporate Bitcoin holders. This isn’t just news; it’s a clear signal that the world’s most prominent businesses are increasingly embracing digital assets. The Unstoppable Rise of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption The journey of Bitcoin from a niche digital currency to a significant corporate treasury asset has been nothing short of phenomenal. What began with a few pioneering companies has now blossomed into a widespread movement. The report by Bitwise, cited by JinSe Finance, paints a vivid picture of this accelerating trend. We’re talking about a significant portion of Bitcoin’s finite supply now being held by entities that traditionally focused on more conventional assets. Consider these key figures: Total Companies: 125 publicly traded firms. Total Bitcoin Held: 847,000 BTC. Percentage of Total Supply: 4.03%. Approximate Value: $91 billion (as of June 30). Q2 2025 Additions: A record 159,000 BTC. New Entrants in Q2: 46 companies. These numbers aren’t just statistics; they represent a growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its role as a strategic asset. The influx of new firms in just one quarter underscores a significant shift in corporate financial strategy, moving beyond traditional reserves to include digital assets. Why Are Publicly Traded Companies Betting Big on Bitcoin? The decision for a publicly traded company to allocate a portion of its treasury to Bitcoin is not made lightly. It involves extensive due diligence, risk assessment, and a forward-looking vision. So, what’s driving this significant pivot? Several compelling factors contribute to this growing appetite for Bitcoin among corporate giants: Inflation Hedge: In an era of increasing monetary expansion and inflation concerns, Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it an attractive hedge against currency debasement. Companies view it as a store of value, similar to digital gold. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate balance sheet provides diversification away from traditional fiat currencies and conventional financial instruments, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Potential for Appreciation: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has historically offered substantial returns over the long term, outperforming many traditional assets. Companies are positioning themselves to benefit from future price appreciation. Strategic Advantage: Early adoption can position a company as innovative and forward-thinking, appealing to a new generation of investors and customers who are increasingly crypto-savvy. Balance Sheet Optimization: For some, holding Bitcoin is a way to optimize capital, especially in low-interest-rate environments where traditional cash holdings yield minimal returns. Companies like MicroStrategy, a pioneer in this space, have openly discussed their rationale, emphasizing Bitcoin’s potential as a superior treasury reserve asset. Their success, despite market fluctuations, has likely encouraged others to explore similar strategies. Understanding the Mechanics: How Bitcoin Holdings Impact Corporate Strategy While the benefits are clear, integrating Bitcoin into a corporate treasury comes with its own set of challenges and considerations. Companies must navigate a complex landscape of volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and accounting standards. Key aspects companies consider when managing their Bitcoin holdings: Volatility Management: Implementing robust risk management strategies to mitigate the impact of Bitcoin’s price swings. This might include dollar-cost averaging, holding long-term, or utilizing hedging instruments. Regulatory Compliance: Adhering to evolving regulations across different jurisdictions regarding digital asset ownership, reporting, and taxation. This is a dynamic area requiring constant vigilance. Accounting Treatment: Understanding and applying the appropriate accounting standards for digital assets, which can vary and impact financial statements. Security: Ensuring the highest level of security for their Bitcoin assets, often through institutional-grade custodianship solutions that offer cold storage and multi-signature protocols. Public Perception: Managing stakeholder expectations and communicating the rationale behind their Bitcoin strategy to investors, employees, and the public. The rise of specialized service providers catering to institutional Bitcoin needs – from custody solutions to prime brokerage services – has made it easier for corporations to manage these complexities, paving the way for broader adoption. What Does This Institutional Bitcoin Trend Mean for the Future? The growing embrace of Bitcoin by publicly traded companies is more than just a fleeting trend; it signifies a profound shift in how corporations view and manage their assets. This institutional Bitcoin adoption has far-reaching implications for the broader financial ecosystem. Consider the potential impacts: Increased Market Stability: As more institutional capital enters the market, it could potentially lead to reduced volatility over the long term, as these entities tend to be long-term holders. Mainstream Acceptance: Corporate adoption lends significant credibility to Bitcoin, pushing it further into the mainstream and encouraging retail investors and even other corporations to consider it. Regulatory Clarity: The increasing presence of institutional players often prompts regulators to provide clearer guidelines and frameworks, which can further de-risk the asset class. Innovation in Financial Products: The demand from corporations is driving the development of new financial products and services tailored for digital assets, such as Bitcoin ETFs and sophisticated custody solutions. Redefinition of Treasury Management: Corporate treasury departments may increasingly view digital assets as a standard component of a diversified reserve strategy, alongside traditional currencies and bonds. This trend suggests that Bitcoin is not just surviving but thriving, solidifying its position as a legitimate and increasingly indispensable asset in the global financial landscape. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Era of Crypto Investment For individual investors and companies alike, the surge in corporate Bitcoin holdings offers valuable insights into the evolving world of crypto investment . Understanding this landscape can help in making informed decisions. Here are some actionable takeaways: For Individual Investors: Research is Key: Understand the fundamentals of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Don’t invest based on hype. Long-Term Perspective: Many corporate holders view Bitcoin as a long-term strategic asset. Consider a similar patient approach. Diversify: While Bitcoin is strong, a diversified portfolio across different asset classes is always prudent. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments and institutional movements, as they often signal broader market trends. For Companies Considering Adoption: Due Diligence: Conduct thorough research into the legal, accounting, and tax implications of holding Bitcoin in your jurisdiction. Risk Assessment: Clearly define your risk tolerance and develop a comprehensive strategy for managing Bitcoin’s volatility. Expert Consultation: Engage with legal, financial, and cybersecurity experts specializing in digital assets to ensure compliance and security. Phased Approach: Consider starting with a smaller allocation to test the waters and gradually increase exposure as comfort and expertise grow. The current environment indicates that the momentum for digital assets, particularly Bitcoin, within corporate treasuries is set to continue, making it a critical area of focus for anyone involved in finance or investment. The narrative is clear: Bitcoin is no longer just a fringe asset. With 125 publicly traded companies holding a combined $91 billion in Bitcoin, and a record influx of new firms in Q2 2025, the institutional embrace is undeniable. This powerful trend signals a growing confidence in Bitcoin’s role as a store of value, an inflation hedge, and a strategic asset for the future. As more corporations integrate Bitcoin into their balance sheets, its legitimacy and influence in the global financial system will only continue to expand, shaping a new era of corporate treasury management and investment.

2025-07-10T10:47:05,"Ethereum Price Poised for Breakout— $4000 Could Be Closer Than You Think","The post Ethereum Price Poised for Breakout— $4000 Could Be Closer Than You Think appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum, the second-largest crypto, appears to be at the cusp of a major breakout. Amid a confluence of strong on-chain activity, growing institutional interest, and a highly favorable technical setup, the ETH price is now flashing multiple bullish signals that could catapult it towards the psychological barrier at $4000. As momentum builds across the Ethereum ecosystem, market participants are increasingly eyeing this zone as a likely destination in the short to mid-term. Recent developments, including Ethereum’s Layer 2 expansion, consistent ETH staking inflows, and overall market sentiment recovery, are creating the perfect storm for a sustained rally. While broader macroeconomic stability and Bitcoin’s price performance continue to influence ETH’s trajectory, the native strength of Ethereum’s network upgrades and deflationary tokenomics are now becoming the primary catalyst for its upside move. Ethereum’s Techncial SetUp Hints Towards a Breakout Ethereum is currently forming a strong bullish continuation pattern, consolidating just below a key resistance zone. On the daily chart, ETH has been maintaining higher lows, hinting at the formation of an ascending triangle—a pattern historically associated with upward breakouts. The price is challenging the $3,200 to $3,300 resistance level, with growing volume and increasing open interest on derivative platforms. Momentum oscillators are turning positive as well. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has broken above the midline and continues trending upwards without entering overbought territory, suggesting room for further gains. Additionally, the MACD shows buying pressure while the CMF maintains a steep upswing above 0, hinting towards a strong inflow of liquidity into the platform. From a broader perspective, ETH has reclaimed the 200-day MA and is now establishing it as a strong support. This technical strength, combined with low exchange reserves and rising whale accumulation, adds weight to the bullish thesis. Network Fundamentals & Staking Metrics Support the Rally Beyond the charts, Ethereum’s fundamentals are aligning with the price narrative. The supply of ETH on CEX has dropped to its lowest point in months, indicating reduced sell-side pressure. Simultaneously, staking activity continues to grow, with over 32 million ETH now locked in the Beacon Chain—effectively removing a significant portion of the circulating supply. Moreover, the ETH gas fee burn mechanism remains active, ensuring a deflationary tilt on the tokenomics. With more ETH being burned than issued on high-activity days, the long-term value proposition of the asset remains strong. Institutional interest is also picking up again, with inflows into ETH-focused investment products registering consistent weekly gains.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/ethereum-price-poised-for-breakout-4000-could-be-closer-than-you-think/,"ETH|TRADING|MARKET|BTC|EXCHANGE","Price Analysis|Ethereum",cryptocompare
2025-07-10T10:42:32,"Why Is Crypto Up Today? – July 10, 2025","The crypto market is up today. The majority of the top 100 coins per market cap have appreciated over the past 24 hours. At the same time, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has decreased by 0.9% to $3.45 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $128 billion, significantly up from $82.5 billion seen yesterday. TLDR: The crypto market is still surging, with 97 of the top 100 coins turning green; BTC jumped towards a new ATH, while ETH saw the highest increase among the top 10 for the second day in a row; The sentiment moved upwards towards greed territory; US BTC spot ETFs’ inflows jumped to $218.04 million today; US ETH ETFs saw inflows of $211.32 million – the second-highest amount in over five months; “There is still a lot of money sidelined and waiting to be deployed,” which will push prices higher; ”July will test markets, but Bitcoin looks built for it.” Crypto Winners & Losers The crypto market has continued the green streak, with all top 10 coins per market cap rising today. Bitcoin (BTC) is up 2.2%, currently trading at $111,250. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) is the category’s best performer for the second day in a row. It appreciated by 3.1%, currently changing hands at $2,794. The second-highest rise is Dogecoin (DOGE)’s 5.1% to the price of $0.181. Moreover, only three of the top 100 coins are red today. Leo Token (LEO) , Aaave (AAVE) , and Gate (GT) fell by 1%, 0.8%, and 0.6% to $8.96, $297.69, and $16.09, respectively. On the other hand, Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) is the category’s best performer, having appreciated 28.3% to the price of $0.01829. It’s followed by Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) , which is the only other coin with a double-digit increase. It’s up 12% to $1.62. Meanwhile, BTC’s price surged yesterday from the $109,000 level towards $112,000. This was partly the result of the $56.8 billion trading volume. The market cap is unshaken by recent events that were pushing the price down, holding above $2 trillion, signaling strong interest. Bitcoin just ripped +2.7% out of a textbook triangle breakout. Measured move target hit to the dollar at $112K. RSI at 78. Bulls are in full control. Next resistance at $112.8K and $113.4K. Breakout traders are winning this round. #BTC #Bitcoin #Crypto pic.twitter.com/m9xJChlU4f — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) July 9, 2025 Meanwhile, the US Federal Reserve’s June minutes, released on 9 July, said that “tariffs pose a persistent risk for driving up prices.” They decided to keep the federal funds rate steady, but many believe that a rate cut will come later this year – if inflationary pressures ease. ‘July Will Test Markets, But Bitcoin is Built for It’ As BTC surged towards a new ATH, analysts commented on its most recent news. Roshan Roberts, CEO of OKX US , argued that “Bitcoin is showing why it’s in a class of its own. As trade tensions flare and altcoins stumble, institutions are treating BTC as a macro hedge and a maturing asset class.” Roberts says that “July will test markets, but Bitcoin looks built for it.” Additionally, Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, co-founder and CSO of Ledn , said that BTC’s surge is the result of “relentless demand from investors and corporations.” In the last 30 days alone, at least 21 companies have announced new plans to raise and deploy an estimated $3.5 billion into their BTC treasuries, he says. They have bought 6,745 BTC, which is some 20% of their planned purchases. He added that “there is still a lot of money sidelined and waiting to be deployed. If this trend continues, we may see Bitcoin price move much higher from here,” Di Bartolomeo argued. Meanwhile, analysts are debating if we’re about to see an actual breakout or not. As the coin stopped just shy of breaking the high, there may be a pullback next. Overall, many still argue that new all-time highs are near. $BTC Plan for me is straight forward here. Either: A) We're about to see a *true* breakout. In which case we see acceptance above this range (daily close above, time and space, any re-tests are support, etc). In which case I will look to trade *with* the trend, with targets… pic.twitter.com/8Cu5R05we9 — CJ (@CJ900X) July 9, 2025 Additionally, onchain data and intelligence platform Glassnode noted that Bitcoin RHODL Ratio (which compares the realized value of Bitcoin held by different investor age groups) “turned upwards.” It reached its highest level in this cycle on Wednesday, signaling a shift, with single-cycle holders holding more wealth. “Historically, such turns mark transitions in market cycles and cooling speculative momentum,” Glassnode says. #Bitcoin RHODL Ratio has turned upwards – reaching its highest level in this cycle. This signals a shift: more wealth is held by single cycle holders, while 1d–3m activity stays low. Historically, such turns mark transitions in market cycles and cooling speculative momentum. pic.twitter.com/RE2hzjoWH4 — glassnode (@glassnode) July 9, 2025 Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $111,250. Yesterday, the price surged to the monthly high of $111,742, nearing the all-time high of $111,814, before settling on the current level. The next level to keep an eye on is $110,550. BTC holding this level firmly would validate the latest breakout. A drop below and towards the $109,850 level could lead to additional falls. That said, the coin may also retest the $112,000 zone.

The price recovered shortly afterwards and gradually climbed back to the current level. Analysts are noting an increased interest in ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which is likely to impact its price positively. Glassnode noted on Monday that spot ETF flows remained positive for the 8 th consecutive week, with inflows surpassing 61,000 ETH. #Ethereum Spot ETF flows have remained positive for the 8th consecutive week, with net inflows topping 61,000 $ETH pic.twitter.com/aTANkr4RCy — glassnode (@glassnode) July 7, 2025 Also, the crypto market sentiment finally made a more significant move after days of trading within neutral territory. While still in this zone, the Fear and Greed Index moved up to the threshold of greed territory, from 52 yesterday to 58 today . There are no signs of an overheated market yet. Source: CoinMarketCap Moreover, on 9 July, the US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded another day of inflows of $218.04 million , significantly higher than the $80.04 million seen on 8 July and back to the level seen two days ago. BlackRock leads the list again with inflows of $125.58 million. Ark & 21Shares saw the second-highest amount of $56.96 million. Fidelity , Grayscale , Bitwise , Valkyrie , and Invesco also saw positive flows between $2 million and $16 million. On the same day, US ETH ETFs saw inflows surge to $211.32 million , up from less than $47 million a day prior. This is the second-highest amount in over five months. Of this amount, BlackRock’s is $158.62 million. Grayscale ($17.96m), Fidelity ($29.53m), and Franklin ($5.21m) also recorded inflows. Meanwhile, during a 9 July hearing, US Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott urged the lawmakers in that country to advance key crypto market structure legislation . “Today’s hearing is the first full committee hearing on digital assets,” Scott said. “This is a crucial step toward developing a comprehensive framework that gives innovators the clarity they need and gives investors the protections they deserve.” He continued: “Make no mistake: blockchain technology and digital assets are not going away – they are here to stay.” Additionally, Elizabeth Warren, Ranking Member of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, proposed her crypto market legislation framework during this hearing. She devised a list of five priorities to “guide” the legislative process while developing crypto policy. Quick FAQ Why did crypto move with stocks today? The crypto market saw a notable increase over the past 24 hours, as did the US stock market on Wednesday, despite enduring uncertainty about US trade policy. For example, the S&P 500 rose by 0.61%, the Nasdaq-100 increased by 0.72%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up by 0.49%. Is this rally sustainable? Short answer: long-term, yes. Analysts argue that the prices will continue to increase in the mid and long term, but these increases will be followed by typical pullbacks. So far, there is no sign of an incoming bear.

2025-07-10T10:41:49,"Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) Hit Resistance: Price analysis","As Bitcoin (BTC) makes another all-time high and could go even higher, the top layer 1s, Ethereum ($ETH), and Solana ($SOL) have also made hay. However, they have hit strong resistance, and are in overbought territory. What’s next for both? $BTC breaking down? Will altcoins do the same? Bitcoin is the daddy of the cryptocurrencies and of that there is absolutely no doubt. For the altcoins to run, Bitcoin will need to run first. Currently, things are on a knife edge for Bitcoin as to whether Wednesday’s $3,000 surge to a new all-time high will continue, or whether this move is about to break down, given the oversold nature of the king of the cryptocurrencies right now. $ETH meets with solid rejection at $2,800 Source: TradingView Looking on the short-term time frame for the $ETH price it can be seen that the price is now nicely above the major 2,500 horizontal level. However, the recent attempt to surpass the $2,800 horizontal resistance has been met with a solid rejection by the bears. Given how overbought $ETH is on practically every time frame, even up to the weekly, a continuation of this rejection is probably the only game in town right now. A period of sideways and down price action for $ETH? Source: TradingView The weekly view for $ETH shows how important the current horizontal resistance level is. The price structure above this level builds on the firm structure underneath. Once the price gets above and confirms, this would turn into very strong support, enabling the $ETH price to be let loose. All this said, it does not look like it will happen this time. In order for the Stochastic RSIs to reset, the price will need to go sideways and down for a period of time. The bulls will hope to hold the price at the major $2,500 horizontal support level, with perhaps the ascending trendline also offering some support. A $SOL rejection from resistance inevitable? Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart for $SOL shows a similar rejection as for the $ETH price. This is a strong resistance level, and with $SOL being overbought on most time frames, a rejection seems inevitable. Weekly chart shows there could still be upside for $SOL Source: TradingView However, on the weekly time frame, it would appear that there is still hope for further upside for $SOL . The Stochastic RSI indicators have crossed back up, the MACD is also showing a positive cross, and green histogram bars are starting to build higher. On the RSI, the indicator line is above the yellow moving average line, and is angled slightly upward. Can $SOL still keep moving higher with $BTC perhaps losing momentum? This remains to be seen.

2025-07-10T10:40:57,"Ziglu Crisis: UK Crypto Platform Unravels Amid Financial Distress","The crypto world is no stranger to volatility, but when a prominent platform faces severe financial distress, it sends ripples through the community. That’s precisely what’s happening with Ziglu , a UK-based digital banking and crypto platform, which has now officially entered special administration. This development, reported by Crowdfund Insider, marks a critical juncture for the company and its users, highlighting the ongoing challenges in the evolving crypto landscape. Understanding Ziglu’s Financial Distress: What Went Wrong? For months, signs of trouble had been brewing at Ziglu. The company, once a promising name in the UK crypto scene, found itself in a precarious financial position. This wasn’t a sudden collapse but rather a culmination of factors, including broader market downturns and specific regulatory hurdles. The severity of its financial distress ultimately led to the drastic step of seeking special administration, a process designed to manage the affairs of a struggling financial institution. A key turning point came in June when the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) imposed significant operational restrictions on Ziglu. These restrictions were a direct response to the company’s financial state and regulatory compliance. The immediate consequences were severe: Freezing of “Boost” Accounts: Ziglu’s yield-generating “Boost” accounts, which offered users returns on their crypto holdings, were immediately frozen. This move directly impacted users expecting passive income from their assets. Suspension of Services: Both e-money and crypto services were suspended, effectively halting all new deposits, withdrawals, and trading activities on the platform. These actions by the FCA underscore the regulator’s commitment to protecting consumers, even if it means disrupting services in the short term. For Ziglu, it meant a severe curtailment of its operations, pushing it further into financial instability. The Impact of FCA Restrictions on UK Crypto Operations The intervention by the FCA restrictions served as a stark reminder of the evolving regulatory environment for digital asset firms in the UK. The FCA’s role is to ensure market integrity and consumer protection, and its actions against Ziglu demonstrate its willingness to enforce these principles. For a crypto platform, having its operations restricted by a major financial regulator can be a death knell, as it erodes user trust and severely limits revenue streams. The situation also highlights a broader trend: the increasing scrutiny faced by crypto companies globally. Regulators are keen to bring digital asset services within existing financial frameworks, often leading to stricter compliance requirements. While beneficial for long-term stability and investor confidence, this transition period can be particularly challenging for startups like Ziglu that might struggle to meet stringent capital and operational standards. The Unraveling Robinhood Acquisition and Its Aftermath Adding another layer of complexity to Ziglu’s woes was the highly anticipated, yet ultimately failed, Robinhood acquisition . Earlier, there were strong indications that U.S.-based trading giant Robinhood was poised to acquire Ziglu, a deal that would have provided a much-needed lifeline and a significant exit opportunity for Ziglu’s investors and founders. Robinhood, known for its commission-free trading, had been looking to expand its international footprint, and Ziglu seemed like a strategic fit for its foray into the UK market. However, Robinhood ultimately pulled out of the deal. While the exact reasons for the withdrawal were not publicly disclosed, it’s highly probable that the deteriorating market conditions, coupled with Ziglu’s growing financial distress and the looming FCA restrictions, played a significant role. The collapse of this acquisition was a devastating blow, removing the most viable path to recovery and leaving Ziglu without a strategic partner or the crucial capital injection it desperately needed. This failed deal underscores the fragility of mergers and acquisitions in the volatile crypto space, where market conditions and regulatory landscapes can shift rapidly, altering the viability of even well-advanced negotiations. Navigating Special Administration: What It Means for Ziglu Users With Ziglu now in special administration , the focus shifts to the administrators appointed to manage the company’s affairs. Special administration is a specific insolvency regime for investment firms in the UK, designed to ensure that client assets are returned as quickly and efficiently as possible, while also maximizing returns for creditors. For Ziglu users, the most pressing concern is the fate of their assets. The company is currently urging users to withdraw their assets from wallets and accounts. This is a critical step, and users should act promptly. However, there’s ongoing uncertainty over the timeline and feasibility of these withdrawals, especially for funds held in frozen “Boost” accounts. It’s important for users to: Check Official Communications: Regularly monitor official announcements from Ziglu and the appointed administrators for instructions and updates. Attempt Withdrawals: Follow any instructions provided to withdraw assets from their accounts. Document Holdings: Keep detailed records of their account balances and any attempted transactions. Seek Independent Advice: If in doubt, consult with financial or legal professionals familiar with crypto insolvency. While special administration aims to protect client assets, the process can be complex and time-consuming. Users should prepare for potential delays and uncertainties regarding the full recovery of their funds, especially if those funds were part of yield-generating products not held in segregated client accounts. Broader Lessons for the UK Crypto Landscape The unfortunate situation with Ziglu serves as a crucial case study for the wider UK crypto industry. It highlights several key takeaways: Regulatory Scrutiny is Increasing: Firms operating in the UK must be prepared for rigorous oversight from the FCA. Compliance is not optional but fundamental to sustainable operation. Due Diligence is Paramount for Users: Users must exercise extreme caution and conduct thorough due diligence before entrusting their funds to any crypto platform, especially those offering high-yield products. Understanding how and where funds are held (e.g., segregated client accounts vs. company balance sheets) is vital. Market Volatility Impacts All: Even well-funded startups can be vulnerable to severe market downturns and the ripple effects they cause, including failed acquisitions and increased regulatory pressure. The Importance of Robust Business Models: Companies need resilient business models that can withstand economic shocks and adapt to evolving regulatory landscapes. The Ziglu case underscores the need for greater transparency and consumer protection mechanisms within the crypto space as it matures and integrates further into mainstream finance. It’s a reminder that innovation must go hand-in-hand with robust risk management and regulatory adherence. In conclusion, Ziglu’s entry into special administration is a somber development for the UK crypto sector. It reflects the harsh realities of navigating a nascent yet rapidly evolving industry, compounded by intense regulatory scrutiny and volatile market conditions. For users, it’s a call to action to secure their assets and remain vigilant. For the industry, it’s a stark lesson on the critical importance of regulatory compliance, robust financial health, and transparent operations to build a sustainable future for digital finance.

2025-07-10T10:32:51,"Bitcoin Legend Max Keiser Predicts BTC to Hit $220K in 2025","Veteran Bitcoin (BTC) evangelist Max Keiser has reignited bullish sentiment in the crypto community with a renewed call that the OG cryptocurrency will reach $220,000 before the end of 2025. In a series of posts on X, he stressed that his forecast, once seen as outlandish, now appears increasingly plausible, especially following BTC’s new all-time high of $112,152, reached just hours earlier. $220K BTC Call Gains New Momentum Keiser first floated his $220,000 prediction in December 2022 during an interview with Daniela Cambone. At the time, the digital asset market was caught in a debilitating “crypto winter,” with its overall value plummeting from $3 trillion to under $1 trillion and BTC sinking to five-digit lows. The former broadcaster is now circling back to the projection, pointing out that the price of Bitcoin has increased 700% since his sit-down with Cambone. “Bitcoin up 700% since this interview 2 years ago (and $220,000 in 2025 looks likely),” Keiser wrote on X. While skeptics challenged his thesis two years ago, BTC’s current price is lending it credibility. “$220,000 in 2025,” he reiterated in another post. The number one cryptocurrency recently chalked up a new all-time high, after initially surging past $109,000 following comments by U.S. President Donald Trump on July 9, demanding the Federal Reserve execute the “biggest interest rate cut in history.” Analysts at the Kobeissi Letter warned that such an unprecedented cut, while potentially saving $174 billion in near-term interest and slashing mortgage rates, could supercharge inflation, possibly benefiting riskier assets like Bitcoin. This macro bombshell shattered weeks of consolidation between $105,000 and $110,000, decisively propelling BTC past its old peak. Market intelligence firm Santiment pinpointed the breakout’s contrarian nature, noting it occurred precisely when “many retailers had been dropping out due to boredom or disbelief,” a classic signal of smart money accumulation preceding major rallies. Keiser Holds Back on Timing to Avoid Investor ‘Fear’ At the time of this writing, Bitcoin was trading near $111,090, and showing modest momentum, with gains of 2.1% in the last 24 hours and 1.8% over the past week. While Keiser’s $220,000 target remains highly ambitious, his conviction has been constant through the asset’s ups and downs. However, he has intriguingly hinted at withholding the precise timing of his prediction, suggesting the full picture might unsettle investors. “I pause before giving exact timing of price targets not to scare people,” Keiser admitted in one post, adding more emphatically in another, “If I gave you both the price and date most of you would be scared.” The post Bitcoin Legend Max Keiser Predicts BTC to Hit $220K in 2025 appeared first on CryptoPotato .",cryptopotato,https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-legend-max-keiser-predicts-btc-to-hit-220k-in-2025/,"BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|FIAT","AA News|BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|Bitcoin|Bitcoin Long-Term Prediction",cryptocompare
2025-07-10T10:30:49,"Bank of Korea Issues Crucial Warning on Non-Bank Won Stablecoins","Are you tracking the evolving landscape of digital currencies? The world of finance is abuzz with discussions around stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). In a significant development, the Bank of Korea has voiced strong concerns regarding the issuance of won stablecoins by non-banking entities. This stance sends a clear signal about the nation’s cautious approach to digital currency innovation, prioritizing financial stability and consumer protection. Understanding Won Stablecoins and Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) The rise of digital assets has brought forth new forms of currency, notably stablecoins. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins aim to maintain a stable value by pegging themselves to a reserve asset, often a fiat currency like the US dollar or the Korean Won. A won stablecoin , for instance, would be designed to hold a value equivalent to one Korean Won, typically backed by reserves of the same currency held by an issuer. However, the concept of a stablecoin issued by a private, non-banking entity raises distinct questions when compared to a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) . While both are digital representations of a national currency, their underlying structure, regulatory oversight, and implications for the broader financial system differ fundamentally. The Bank of Korea , through its Governor Rhee Chang-yong, highlights this crucial distinction. What’s the Core Difference? Issuer: Private stablecoins are issued by companies, sometimes outside traditional financial regulation. CBDCs are issued directly by the central bank. Backing: Private stablecoins rely on reserves held by the issuer, which may or may not be fully transparent or audited. CBDCs are direct liabilities of the central bank, carrying sovereign backing. Purpose: Private stablecoins often aim for faster, cheaper transactions and broader crypto ecosystem integration. CBDCs aim to modernize payment systems, enhance financial inclusion, and maintain monetary policy control. Why is the Bank of Korea Concerned About Non-Bank Won Stablecoins? Governor Rhee Chang-yong’s statement isn’t merely a cautionary note; it reflects deep-seated concerns shared by central banks globally regarding the potential risks posed by privately issued stablecoins, especially when they reach systemic importance. The problems he alludes to are multi-faceted, touching upon the very pillars of a nation’s economic health and its citizens’ financial well-being. Potential Pitfalls of Private Stablecoin Issuance: Threats to Financial Stability: Imagine a large-scale private stablecoin issuer facing a liquidity crisis or a ‘run’ on its reserves. This could trigger panic, leading to widespread redemptions and potentially destabilizing the broader financial system, much like a bank run. Without robust regulatory frameworks and oversight, such an event could have ripple effects across markets. Erosion of Monetary Policy Control: If a significant portion of transactions and savings migrate from traditional bank deposits to privately issued stablecoins, the central bank’s ability to influence interest rates, manage money supply, and conduct effective monetary policy could be severely hampered. This loss of control could undermine efforts to manage inflation or stimulate economic growth. Consumer Protection Risks: Unlike bank deposits, privately issued stablecoins typically lack the safety nets of deposit insurance schemes. If an issuer becomes insolvent, consumers could lose their funds. Furthermore, issues around transparency of reserves, operational resilience, and cybersecurity could expose users to significant risks. Challenges in Combating Illicit Finance: The decentralized nature and pseudonymous aspects of some stablecoin operations could make them attractive for money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit activities. Central banks and regulators face an uphill battle in enforcing Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) measures effectively without proper oversight. The Bank of Korea ‘s apprehension stems from a commitment to safeguarding the integrity and stability of the national currency and payment system. This is where the concept of a CBDC becomes paramount as a secure, reliable alternative. The Han River Project: Korea’s Path to a Secure Digital Currency In response to the evolving digital landscape and to address the very concerns raised about private stablecoins, the Bank of Korea has been actively pursuing its central bank digital currency initiative, known as the ‘Han River Project’. This project is not merely an experiment; it’s a strategic undertaking aimed at laying the groundwork for a future digital won that is both innovative and secure. Key Aspects of the Han River Project: Foundational Infrastructure: The project is designed to build a robust and resilient digital currency infrastructure that can support future financial innovations while ensuring stability. Security and Reliability: By issuing the digital won directly, the BOK aims to provide the highest level of security and reliability, backed by the full faith and credit of the central bank. This contrasts sharply with the potential risks associated with private stablecoin issuers. Phased Approach: The Han River Project has involved various phases, including technical feasibility studies, pilot programs, and simulations to test the practical applications and implications of a CBDC in a real-world scenario. Innovation Catalyst: While focused on stability, the CBDC is also viewed as a potential catalyst for innovation in payment systems, enabling new services and efficiencies within the financial sector. Governor Rhee’s statement underscores that the Han River Project is the ‘first step toward introducing secure and reliable won-based stablecoins.’ This implies that while private stablecoins are viewed with caution, the BOK acknowledges the demand for digital won-based instruments and seeks to fulfill this demand through a centrally controlled, secure mechanism. Global Implications for Digital Currency and Regulation The Bank of Korea ‘s stance is not isolated; it mirrors a growing trend among central banks worldwide grappling with the challenges and opportunities presented by digital currencies. From the European Central Bank’s exploration of a digital euro to China’s advanced digital yuan project, central banks are actively researching and developing their own CBDCs as a response to the digital revolution and as a means to maintain control over their monetary systems. A Global Balancing Act: Regulators globally are walking a tightrope between fostering innovation in the digital asset space and mitigating systemic risks. The debate often revolves around: Regulation vs. Prohibition: Should private stablecoins be banned, or can they be brought under a robust regulatory umbrella similar to traditional financial institutions? Interoperability: How can CBDCs and regulated private digital assets coexist and interact seamlessly within the broader financial ecosystem? Cross-Border Payments: Can CBDCs facilitate more efficient and secure international transactions, potentially reducing reliance on traditional correspondent banking? The Korean perspective adds another layer to this global dialogue, emphasizing the central bank’s role as the ultimate guarantor of financial stability in the digital era. What Does This Mean for the Future of Won Stablecoins and the Crypto Market? Governor Rhee’s remarks signal a clear direction for the future of won stablecoins in Korea. It’s highly probable that non-bank entities issuing such stablecoins will face significant regulatory hurdles, if not outright restrictions, in the coming years. The emphasis will likely shift towards central bank-issued digital won as the preferred and most secure form of digital national currency. Actionable Insights: For Crypto Businesses: Companies operating with won-pegged tokens should closely monitor BOK’s regulatory developments. The focus might shift towards integrating with future CBDC infrastructure rather than relying on privately issued stablecoins. For Investors: Be aware of the regulatory risks associated with privately issued stablecoins, especially those lacking clear oversight. The ‘secure and reliable’ label will increasingly apply to central bank-backed digital assets. For Policymakers: The BOK’s stance provides a case study for balancing innovation with risk management, highlighting the importance of a clear regulatory perimeter for all forms of digital currency . The trajectory seems clear: the Bank of Korea is committed to ensuring that any digital form of the won maintains the same level of trust, security, and stability as its physical counterpart, with the CBDC being the primary vehicle for achieving this goal. Concluding Thoughts: Navigating Korea’s Digital Currency Future The Bank of Korea’s strong position on non-bank issued won stablecoins underscores a global imperative: as the financial world digitizes, central banks are asserting their role as guardians of monetary sovereignty and financial stability . While private innovation is valued, the risks associated with unregulated digital currencies, particularly those purporting to be stable, are too significant to ignore. The Han River Project represents a proactive and pragmatic approach by the Bank of Korea to embrace digital transformation on its own terms, ensuring that the transition to a digital economy is secure, inclusive, and resilient. This stance will undoubtedly shape the landscape for digital assets in Korea, setting a precedent for how a major economy approaches the delicate balance between innovation and regulation in the age of digital money.

2025-07-10T10:25:38,"Whale Rotation: Is Big Money Leaving Bitcoin for Altcoins?","The post Whale Rotation: Is Big Money Leaving Bitcoin for Altcoins? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market today has taken a bullish turn, with total market capitalization climbing to $3.47 trillion and Bitcoin surging to a new all-time high. Altcoins, too, are not behind, as they are showing renewed strength, boosted by a 46.62% spike in daily trading volume. Yet, in the midst of all this green, one question remains in investor minds: “ What are whales doing right now?” The question remains valid and vital, as Whale activity often signals where the next big rally or correction is headed. That being said, with the Fear & Greed Index at a neutral 58 and BTC dominance at a healthy 63.8%, signs suggest Bitcoin is still in charge. But beneath the surface, whale behavior tells a more nuanced story. Intrigued enough? I am sure you are. Join me as I give you a comprehensive overview of what Whales are buying now, is it Bitcoin or Altcoins? What Does OnChain Speak? Exchange Netflows Show BTC Exits The CryptoQuant exchange netflow chart highlights multiple days of negative netflows , with July 7 standing out. When over 10,000 BTC were withdrawn from exchanges, which has been the biggest single-day outflow in recent weeks. This suggests strong HODLing sentiment, often analyzed as bullish since whales are less likely to sell immediately. Whale Transaction Spike Big? Santiment’s whale transaction count (>$1M) showed a massive surge on July 8, indicating significant whale activity. This could reflect both accumulation and distribution, but the timing is just before Bitcoin’s price breakout. This further hints at a possible rotation into high-risk, high-profit altcoins. Altcoin Season Still a Distant Dream? While there are numerous positive metrics, the Altcoin Season Index by CoinMarketCap sits at just 28/100, indicating we’re not yet in full rotation mode. However, that may change rapidly if BTC dominance drops and altcoins sustain breakouts. BTC vs Alts As evident from the chart, BTC faces a strong hurdle near its ATH despite bullish netflows. Momentum indicators RSI and MACD suggest a temporary cool-off may be due. In contrast, top altcoins ETH, SOL, amongst others, are showing early signs of breakouts from consolidation, supported by increasing whale wallet activity and stablecoin inflows into alt-heavy exchanges. Curious about Ethereum’s future? Read our Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! FAQs Why do whales rotate from BTC to altcoins? Whales rotate to maximize profits. Once BTC rallies and shows signs of stalling, whales shift to altcoins. What does a drop in BTC dominance mean? It often signals the beginning of an alt season, as capital flows from Bitcoin into altcoins like ETH, SOL, or newer Layer-1s.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/whale-rotation-is-big-money-leaving-bitcoin-for-altcoins/,"BTC|ALTCOIN|TRADING|ETH|MARKET","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare

2025-07-10T10:20:25,"German firms split on the future of crypto payments.","German businesses are split in their expectations about the future of cryptocurrency as a means of payment, shows a large-scale study covering hundreds of companies registered in the Bundesrepublik. While nearly half of the interviewed organizations believe crypto payments will become a common phenomenon in the next decade, most remain skeptical about taking decentralized digital money for the goods and services they are offering. German firms undecided on crypto as payment tool The share of German companies accepting and spending cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) is still quite small, but many more think crypto payments will grow in the coming years, according to a new survey, carried out by the industry organization Bitkom. Almost half of the respondents, or 48%, believe payments with crypto will be common 10 years from now. Yet, only 2% are currently using them, and six out of a hundred are open to the option, the German crypto news outlet BTC Echo reported on Wednesday. A total of 602 entities, employing at least 20 people, have participated in the poll conducted by telephone between early March and mid-April, this year. A sizable majority (86%) do not plan to start accepting cryptocurrencies in the near future, citing high price volatility, risks of fraud, legal uncertainty, and lack of knowledge among the main reasons for their reserved attitude. Nevertheless, the study found that 12% of large companies, those with at least 500 employees, are considering the digital assets as a payment method, the authors noted. Frederic Meyer, a blockchain consultant working for Bitkom, remarked: “There is interest in blockchain and cryptocurrencies in the economy – particularly in the financial sector, concrete applications are currently making noticeable progress.” Founded in Berlin right before the turn of the century, the Bitkom association now represents over 2,200 firms involved in Germany’s digital economy. Among its members are more than 1,000 small and medium-sized enterprises, over 500 startups, half the 40 DAX companies, including global players, its website details. MiCA to shape future of crypto in Germany and Europe The future of cryptocurrencies and businesses built around them in Europe as a whole, not just the Federal Republic of Germany, will be largely determined by the implementation of the EU’s new Markets in Crypto Assets ( MiCA ) law. The adoption of the unified regulation in the European Union has been welcomed by representatives of the crypto sector as it seeks to standardize rules for digital asset activities and allows businesses to operate across the 27-strong bloc with a single license. Major crypto firms have already applied or acquired one in an EU member state. Last month, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, OKX, launched fully regulated trading platforms in Germany and neighboring Poland after obtaining MiCA authorization. The new regulations, which concern the issuance, custody, trading, and disclosure of crypto assets, have also posed challenges for market participants. Europe’s top Bitcoin ATM operator, Austria-based Kurant, recently halted services in Germany to prepare for the MiCA requirements. Authorities in Berlin have so far maintained a generally positive regulatory approach regarding crypto, including by offering a tax exemption for investors who hold Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) or other cryptocurrencies for more than a year. In April, the parties forming the new federal government led by Chancellor Friedrich Merz dropped a proposal to raise the tax on crypto investments, by removing the one-year holding period, from their coalition agreement ahead of taking office in May 2025. Bitkom’s Frederic Meyer suggested that Germany’s newly established Digital Ministry should appoint staff to focus specifically on the blockchain sector and even set up a dedicated department. “Only this way can business and the society tap into the technology’s potential,” the blockchain expert insisted.

2025-07-10T10:15:07,"Veteran Trader Peter Brandt Is Long on Bitcoin (BTC), But There’s a Catch","TL;DR Peter Brandt remains bullish on bitcoin with ambitious targets, but alerted about the appearance of a bearish pattern. Despite optimistic predictions from multiple analysts, technical indicators such as a near-overbought RSI suggest that the asset’s rally might face short-term resistance. Watch Out for This Level Several hours ago, bitcoin (BTC) made history by tapping a new all-time high price of over $112,000. One prominent figure in the crypto industry who has commented on the asset’s recent performance is Peter Brandt. The veteran trader spotted the formation of an expanding inverted triangle on BTC’s price chart, arguing that it has “a higher rate of morphing or mortality” than a pattern like the horizontal pennant. Nonetheless, Brandt remains long on the asset, setting short-term targets of $120,958 and $134,886. Investors, though, should be cautious because, according to the trader, a decline under $107,000 “would suggest morphology.” An expanding inverted triangle is a pattern where price fluctuations become wider over time, forming higher highs and lower lows in a megaphone shape. It’s generally considered bearish, as it signals market instability and could result in a breakdown. On the contrary, a horizontal pennant is a consolidation pattern where the asset’s valuation drifts sideways after a significant move. It’s usually viewed as a bullish signal, assuming it follows an upward trend. Brandt is known as a proponent of the primary cryptocurrency. Just a few weeks ago, he recommended that people make monthly investments and allocate 80% of the capital to SPY (the ETF that tracks the S&P 500 Index) and the remaining 20% to BTC. Other Forecasts The X user CRYPTOWZRD is also optimistic that BTC could post additional gains in the near future , envisioning a rally to $132,500 based on the potential formation of an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. KALEO was even more optimistic, predicting a price explosion to $500,000. #Bitcoin / $BTC $500K IS A MAGNET pic.twitter.com/ni2oFVs9hf — K A L E O (@CryptoKaleo) July 9, 2025 Some indicators support the bullish theories. BTC’s exchange netflow has been predominantly negative over the last month, signaling a shift from centralized exchanges to self-custody methods, which reduces the immediate selling pressure. BTC Exchange Netflow, Source: CryptoQuant On the other hand, the asset’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is quite close to the bearish zone of 70.
