Here Are the Details","Bitcoin's price reached a new all-time high of $112,014, according to analysts at crypto data analysis firm CryptoQuant. Bitcoin Reaches All-Time High at $112,014: Premium Over Coinbase Shows US Demand With this rise, the Bitcoin price gap between Coinbase and Binance has also widened noticeably: the price on Coinbase is $42 higher than on Binance. This price difference, the Coinbase premium, is considered a strong indicator of strong demand from US-based investors. Analysts note that such positive premiums typically signal growing interest in Bitcoin from institutional or individual investors. However, this week's $42 difference isn't the highest it's been in recent days. Last week, Coinbase's premium climbed to $87.76, indicating a period of much more intense buying pressure in the market. Analysts made the following statements: The Coinbase premium is a key indicator of US investor demand. Despite prices reaching all-time highs, the positive premium suggests that buying interest in the market remains strong. This suggests the upward trend may not be over yet. While the Bitcoin market continues its path with new highs, the orientation of institutional investors, especially in the US, continues to play a determining role in pricing. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-10T08:46:12,"Chinese creditors challenge FTX’s bid to block billions in payouts","The bankrupt exchange’s latest proposal to waive creditor settlements in certain regions has drawn legal resistance from a group of Chinese users. On July 8, 2025, FTX creditor Weiwei Ji filed an objection in the Delaware Bankruptcy Court, representing 300 others in opposition to the exchange. Central to the filing is the rejection of the bankruptcy estate’s proposal to restrict payouts to users in 49 jurisdictions, where crypto is banned or unclear under local law. China , which accounts for more than 80% of the affected claim value, is one of the key regions under review, alongside countries like Russia, Morocco, North Korea, and others. If officially designated, creditors in these regions could be excluded from the ongoing distribution process . You might also like: Why FTX creditors in 49 countries may be cut from payouts Ji, a Chinese passport holder and tax resident of Singapore, argued that the inclusion of China in the list is both factually wrong and legally unsupported, arguing that distributing funds to users in the region carries no regulatory or criminal implications. “The FTX Recovery Trust’s attempt to withhold distributions from Chinese creditors based on jurisdictional interpretations of crypto regulation is both unreasonable and legally unfounded,” Ji wrote. “There is no credible legal basis to conclude that distributions to Chinese creditors would subject the Trust, or any distribution agent, to regulatory or criminal risk.” He noted that FTX claims are denominated and settled in U.S. dollars, not crypto, and can be lawfully received by Chinese residents through standard channels, including wire transfers via Hong Kong -based accounts. To strengthen his case, Ji emphasized the legal status of crypto in China. Crypto holdings, not trading, are ‘lawful’ under Chinese laws While retail trading may be restricted, Ji argued that crypto ownership remains legal in the country, with courts recognizing assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) as personal property. This view has been supported by past rulings, including a 2024 ruling by a Shanghai Court that affirmed the protection of digital assets under civil law. He also pointed out that Hong Kong, which maintains a more favorable stance on crypto , operates under a separate legal framework and actively supports regulated digital asset activity. Read more: Is crypto banned in China? Full history of China crypto bans Supporting his case, Ji cited legal precedent, including the Celsius bankruptcy, where Chinese users were paid in USD, and the Mt. Gox rehabilitation, where Chinese creditors successfully received crypto payouts through Kraken, emphasizing that neither case imposed restrictions based on jurisdiction. FTX’s motion remains under review ahead of a court hearing scheduled for July 22, and Ji is urging the court to reject any designation that would exclude Chinese creditors from receiving their share under the bankruptcy plan.

2025-07-10T08:40:10,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Navigating the Surge into the ‘Greed Zone’","Are you feeling the buzz in the crypto market ? The digital asset landscape is constantly evolving, and understanding its pulse is key to making informed decisions. One of the most insightful tools for gauging this pulse is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index . This fascinating indicator, often a bellwether for investor sentiment, recently climbed to a significant 71, firmly positioning itself within the ‘Greed’ zone. But what exactly does this mean for you and your crypto investments? What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does it Matter? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , developed by Alternative.me, serves as a powerful barometer for the overall mood in the cryptocurrency space. Ranging from 0 to 100, it visually represents the prevailing emotional state of investors: 0 (Extreme Fear): Signals that investors are overly worried, often leading to panic selling. This can sometimes present a buying opportunity for contrarian investors. 100 (Extreme Greed): Indicates that investors are overly enthusiastic, potentially leading to FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) and irrational exuberance. This can often precede a market correction. On July 10, the index recorded a notable rise to 71, a five-point jump from the previous day, solidifying its position in the ‘Greed’ zone. This upward shift reflects improved market sentiment , suggesting a growing confidence among participants. But how is this crucial number derived? Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: How is it Calculated? Understanding the methodology behind the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is crucial to appreciating its insights. It’s not just a random number; it’s a weighted average of several key market indicators, each contributing to the overall sentiment score: Volatility (25%): This component measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average values over the last 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility often indicates a fearful market. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This factor analyzes the current volume and market momentum, comparing it to average values. High buying volumes and strong momentum typically signal greed. Social Media (15%): The index scours various social media platforms, particularly Twitter, for specific keywords and hashtags related to cryptocurrency. An unusually high number of interactions or trending topics can indicate heightened interest and potential greed. Surveys (15%): While currently paused, this component traditionally involved weekly polls asking thousands of people about their perception of the crypto market. Investor opinions directly feed into the sentiment. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): This metric measures Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. A rising Bitcoin dominance often suggests that investors are moving funds from altcoins back into Bitcoin, which can be a sign of caution or a flight to safety during uncertain times, or confidence in Bitcoin’s stability. Google Trends (10%): The index analyzes Google search queries related to cryptocurrencies. A sudden surge in search terms like ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ or ‘crypto bubble’ often points to fear, while searches for ‘buy crypto’ or ‘how to invest in Bitcoin’ might indicate growing interest and potential greed. Each of these factors contributes to painting a holistic picture of the prevailing emotional state of the crypto market . Navigating the ‘Greed Zone’: What Does 71 Mean for Your Investments? The index’s climb to 71 places it firmly in the ‘ Greed Zone ‘. While this might sound positive – indicating bullish sentiment and upward price momentum – it also warrants a degree of caution. Historically, periods of extreme greed have often preceded market corrections. Here’s what a high ‘Greed’ score could imply: Increased FOMO: As prices rise, more investors, particularly new ones, might feel the ‘Fear Of Missing Out’ and jump into the market, driving prices even higher in the short term. Overvaluation Concerns: A market driven by excessive greed can lead to assets becoming overvalued, making them vulnerable to sharp pullbacks. Potential for Profit-Taking: Experienced investors often view high greed levels as an opportune time to take profits, which can trigger selling pressure. It’s a delicate balance. While the improved market sentiment is a positive sign for the broader crypto market , it’s also a reminder to remain vigilant and avoid impulsive decisions driven purely by emotion. The Role of Market Sentiment and Bitcoin Dominance in Current Trends The current positive market sentiment , as reflected by the index, is a crucial driver for short-term price movements. When investors are confident, they are more likely to buy, holding assets, and fueling upward trends. Conversely, fear can lead to panic selling, pushing prices down. Furthermore, Bitcoin dominance plays a subtle yet significant role. If Bitcoin’s dominance rises during a period of overall market greed, it might suggest that Bitcoin is leading the charge, or that investors are consolidating their gains from altcoins into the perceived safety of BTC. If Bitcoin dominance falls while the index is high, it could indicate an ‘altcoin season’ where capital flows into smaller cap assets, chasing higher returns. The interplay between these factors provides a nuanced view of the overall health and direction of the crypto market . Actionable Insights: How to Leverage the Crypto Fear & Greed Index So, how can you use this knowledge to your advantage in the dynamic crypto market ? The index is not a crystal ball, but it’s a valuable tool for strategic thinking: Contrarian Investing: Many seasoned investors use the index as a contrarian indicator. When the index is in ‘Extreme Fear’ (0-24), it might be a good time to consider buying, as assets could be undervalued due to panic. Conversely, when it’s in ‘Extreme Greed’ (75-100), it might be a time to consider taking some profits or reducing exposure. Risk Management: A high ‘Greed’ score should prompt you to re-evaluate your risk exposure. Are you over-allocated? Is it time to set stricter stop-loss orders? Avoid FOMO/FUD: The index helps you recognize when market emotions are running high, allowing you to make more rational decisions rather than being swept away by Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) or Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD). Long-Term vs. Short-Term: For long-term holders, daily fluctuations in the index might be less critical. However, for traders, it can provide valuable insights into short-term market psychology. Remember, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is just one tool among many. Always combine its insights with fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and your own risk tolerance. The rise of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 71, firmly within the ‘Greed Zone’, signals a significant shift in market sentiment . While this surge of confidence is certainly encouraging for the crypto market , it also serves as a crucial reminder for investors to approach the current landscape with both enthusiasm and prudence. Understanding the underlying factors, from volatility to Bitcoin dominance , empowers you to navigate these exciting yet unpredictable waters. By leveraging tools like this index, you can strive to make more informed decisions, mitigating risks and potentially capitalizing on opportunities, rather than being swayed by the volatile tides of emotion. Stay informed, stay strategic, and may your crypto journey be prosperous.

2025-07-10T08:30:07,"Thumzup Crypto: A Revolutionary Leap in Digital Asset Strategy","Imagine a Nasdaq-listed company, known for its branding and social media prowess, not just dipping its toes but diving deeper into the unpredictable yet exhilarating waters of cryptocurrency. That’s precisely what Thumzup Media Corporation is doing, signaling a significant shift in how established businesses view digital assets. This isn’t just about Bitcoin anymore; it’s about a bold new frontier for Thumzup crypto holdings. What’s Driving Thumzup’s Expanded Digital Asset Strategy? Thumzup Media Corporation, a prominent Nasdaq-listed provider of branding and social media marketing solutions, recently made waves with an announcement via PR Newswire. Its Board of Directors has approved a significantly expanded list of digital assets for its crypto treasury strategy. This move builds upon their previously disclosed approach, which already allowed up to 90% of their liquid assets to be held in Bitcoin (BTC). Now, the company may also include Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), Ethereum (ETH), and USD Coin (USDC) as part of its reserves. But what exactly is prompting this aggressive digital asset strategy ? Diversification Beyond Bitcoin: While Bitcoin remains the king, diversifying across other cryptocurrencies can mitigate risks associated with a single asset’s volatility and open doors to different growth narratives. Exploring New Use Cases: Each of these chosen altcoins offers unique technological propositions and market opportunities, from payments to decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoin utility. Strategic Positioning: By holding a basket of leading digital assets, Thumzup aims to future-proof its treasury against evolving market dynamics and potentially capitalize on broader market appreciation. Why These Specific Cryptocurrencies for Corporate Crypto Adoption? The selection of DOGE, LTC, SOL, XRP, ETH, and USDC isn’t arbitrary. Each asset brings a distinct value proposition to Thumzup’s portfolio, reflecting a nuanced understanding of the crypto landscape. This thoughtful selection highlights a growing trend in corporate crypto adoption , where companies are moving beyond simple Bitcoin holdings to embrace a more sophisticated approach. Ethereum (ETH): The backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs, Ethereum offers exposure to the broader Web3 ecosystem and potential yield through staking. Its upcoming scalability upgrades (sharding) also promise enhanced utility. Solana (SOL): Known for its high transaction throughput and low fees, Solana is a formidable competitor in the smart contract platform space, attracting significant developer activity and dApps. Ripple (XRP): Despite its ongoing legal battles with the SEC, XRP remains a prominent player in cross-border payments, favored by institutions for its speed and efficiency. Dogecoin (DOGE): Often seen as a ‘meme coin,’ DOGE boasts a massive, engaged community and has gained significant mainstream recognition, making it a unique asset for a branding-focused company like Thumzup. Its low transaction fees and fast confirmation times are also practical. Litecoin (LTC): Often referred to as ‘digital silver’ to Bitcoin’s ‘digital gold,’ Litecoin offers faster transaction times and a larger supply, making it suitable for everyday payments. USD Coin (USDC): As a regulated, fully reserved stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, USDC provides stability within the volatile crypto market. It’s crucial for liquidity management, treasury operations, and potentially earning yield in DeFi protocols while minimizing price risk. This mix allows Thumzup to gain exposure to various segments of the crypto market, from established smart contract platforms to meme coins and stablecoins, demonstrating a sophisticated approach to their digital asset strategy . The Broader Impact: Cryptocurrency Diversification for Public Companies Thumzup’s move is more than just an internal treasury decision; it’s a bellwether for how publicly traded companies might approach cryptocurrency diversification in the future. For years, Bitcoin was the sole acceptable crypto for corporate treasuries, largely due to its perceived status as ‘digital gold’ and its relatively higher liquidity and regulatory clarity compared to altcoins. However, as the crypto market matures and institutions gain a deeper understanding, the benefits of spreading risk and capturing diverse growth opportunities become clearer. Risk Mitigation: Relying solely on one asset, even Bitcoin, carries concentration risk. Diversifying across a basket of well-vetted cryptocurrencies can help cushion the impact of adverse movements in any single asset. Enhanced Returns: Different crypto assets perform well in different market cycles. A diversified portfolio can potentially capture gains from various sectors, optimizing overall returns. Operational Flexibility: Holding stablecoins like USDC provides a stable base for operational expenses, payroll, or simply as a safe harbor during market downturns, without needing to convert back to fiat. This strategy could inspire other Nasdaq-listed companies, particularly those in tech or media, to explore similar avenues, thereby accelerating mainstream crypto adoption. What Does This Mean for a Nasdaq Listed Company Crypto Future? The decision by a Nasdaq listed company crypto strategy to expand beyond Bitcoin sends a powerful signal to the broader financial world. It suggests that digital assets are increasingly being viewed not just as speculative investments but as legitimate components of a corporate treasury. This evolution reflects a growing acceptance and understanding of blockchain technology and its potential to reshape finance. However, such a move is not without its complexities: Volatility Management: Cryptocurrencies, especially altcoins, are highly volatile. Thumzup will need robust risk management frameworks to navigate potential price swings. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Companies holding diverse digital assets must stay abreast of changing laws and compliance requirements. Custody and Security: Securely storing a variety of digital assets requires specialized solutions and expertise to protect against hacks and theft. Accounting and Tax Implications: The accounting and tax treatment of various cryptocurrencies can be complex and differ by jurisdiction, requiring expert financial guidance. Despite these challenges, Thumzup’s bold move positions it as a pioneer, potentially setting a precedent for how other public companies approach their treasury management in the digital age. Thumzup Media Corporation’s strategic expansion into a diversified portfolio of digital assets marks a pivotal moment for Thumzup crypto involvement and corporate treasury management. By embracing a range of cryptocurrencies including DOGE, LTC, SOL, XRP, ETH, and USDC, the Nasdaq-listed firm is not only diversifying its reserves but also signaling a deeper commitment to the future of finance. This move highlights a growing trend of sophistication in corporate crypto strategies, moving beyond a singular focus on Bitcoin to explore the multifaceted opportunities presented by the broader digital asset ecosystem. As more companies witness the potential benefits and navigate the complexities, Thumzup’s pioneering spirit may well pave the way for widespread corporate crypto adoption , redefining how businesses manage their wealth in an increasingly digital world. This is truly a revolutionary step, offering a glimpse into the future of corporate finance.

2025-07-10T08:29:20,"Bitcoin Tapped $112,000: Dormant Whales Stir, Retail Nowhere to Be Found","Bitcoin has reached a fresh all-time high after soaring above $112,000 on Wednesday as it broke out after seven weeks of muted price action. Amid this new peak, coins that have remained dormant for nearly a decade are now stirring. Dormant Bitcoin Activity Rises After observing Spent Output Age Bands data, CryptoQuant found that long-term Bitcoin holders started moving coins dormant for seven to ten years. Historically, such movements have aligned with major price turning points, and raise questions about potential profit-taking amid the current rally. While Bitcoin’s ability to hold its high price range points to underlying market strength, the activation of these old coins adds uncertainty as investors assess the possibility of market overheating. Just last week, two Satoshi-era wallets moved 20,000 BTC worth $2.18 billion after 14 years of dormancy, surprising on-chain watchers. These rare, aged transactions have sparked speculation about early miners or recovered wallets. Despite the size of the transfers, Bitcoin’s price remained stable. Retail Quietly Exits Alongside these rare movements, what stood out in this rally was the limited involvement of retail investors. On this note, Kushal Manupati, Regional Growth & Ops Lead of South Asia at Binance, in a statement to CryptoPotato, said, “Bitcoin hitting an all-time high is a pivotal moment for the virtual digital assets industry. Institutions are showing confidence to enter the space at scale, driving both liquidity and credibility. Importantly, this rally is not purely retail-driven. It reflects the increasing role of crypto in diversified investment portfolios and a growing recognition of the value of Bitcoin.” The retail absence is further evidenced by Santiment’s update, where it explained that in the days leading up to the breakout, this cohort of investors had been exiting the market due to impatience or disbelief. This is a common pattern seen before major crypto rallies. It is often observed that periods of retail exit and cooling sentiment precede major upward moves, as crypto markets tend to move against broader crowd expectations while larger players accumulate. Now that Bitcoin is trading above its previous peak, the focus will shift to whether the number of holders on the network begins to rise, indicating renewed retail interest and potential FOMO as the market responds to this fresh milestone.

2025-07-10T08:10:58,"Jerome Powell Resignation: Senator Lummis Unleashes Shockwave with Urgent Call","A seismic tremor has rippled through Washington D.C., and its potential aftershocks could be felt across the global financial landscape, including the volatile cryptocurrency markets. U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a prominent voice for fiscal conservatism and a known advocate for digital assets, has made a stunning and direct demand: for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to step down. This isn’t just political rhetoric; it’s a serious accusation from a sitting senator, amplified by Watcher Guru on X, that Powell is “unfit to run the Fed.” This bold declaration raises critical questions about the future of monetary policy, the fight against inflation, and what it all means for your investments, especially in the digital asset space. The Unprecedented Call: Why is Senator Lummis Demanding Jerome Powell’s Resignation? Senator Lummis’s call for Jerome Powell’s resignation isn’t a casual remark; it’s a profound statement rooted in her assessment of the current economic climate and the Fed’s handling of it. While the specific reasons cited by Lummis in the Watcher Guru report were succinct (“unfit to run the Fed”), her broader public statements and policy positions offer more context. Lummis has consistently voiced deep concerns over the Federal Reserve’s response to surging inflation, arguing that the central bank was too slow to react, leading to significant erosion of purchasing power for American families and businesses. Her criticism often centers on the perception that the Fed, under Powell’s leadership, allowed inflation to become entrenched by maintaining ultra-low interest rates and engaging in aggressive quantitative easing for too long. When the Fed finally began hiking rates, Lummis and others argued it was a belated and overly aggressive move that risked tipping the economy into recession. This delicate balancing act – controlling inflation without stifling economic growth – is at the heart of the debate. For Senator Lummis, the balance has been mismanaged, leading her to believe that a change in leadership is necessary to restore confidence and steer the nation’s economy more effectively. The sentiment from Senator Lummis reflects a growing frustration among some policymakers and the public regarding the Fed’s performance. The post-pandemic economic boom, coupled with supply chain disruptions and geopolitical events, created a perfect storm for inflation. While the Fed initially characterized inflation as “transitory,” it proved to be far more persistent, leading to a scramble to tighten monetary policy. This shift, from a dovish stance to an aggressive hawkish one, has drawn both praise for its decisiveness and sharp criticism for its perceived delay and potential overcorrection. Understanding the Federal Reserve’s Crucial Role and Federal Reserve Policy Impact To fully grasp the weight of Senator Lummis’s demand, it’s essential to understand the immense power and responsibility vested in the Federal Reserve. As the central bank of the United States, the Fed has a dual mandate: to achieve maximum employment and maintain price stability. These two goals, while seemingly straightforward, often present complex trade-offs, especially in dynamic economic environments. The tools at its disposal include setting the federal funds rate, conducting open market operations (like quantitative easing or tightening), and regulating banks. The impact of Federal Reserve policy impact on daily life is profound. When the Fed raises interest rates, borrowing becomes more expensive, cooling down economic activity and theoretically taming inflation. Conversely, lowering rates encourages borrowing and spending, stimulating growth. These decisions ripple through every sector, affecting mortgage rates, business investments, consumer loans, and even the valuation of assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies. Under Jerome Powell, the Fed navigated unprecedented economic challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic and its subsequent recovery. His tenure has been marked by: Aggressive Stimulus: Initially, the Fed implemented massive stimulus measures to prevent a deeper economic collapse during the pandemic, including near-zero interest rates and large-scale asset purchases. Inflation Surge: Following the stimulus, inflation surged to multi-decade highs, prompting a significant shift in monetary policy. Rapid Rate Hikes: The Fed embarked on one of the fastest rate-hiking cycles in decades to combat inflation, raising the federal funds rate from near zero to over 5%. Balance Sheet Reduction: Alongside rate hikes, the Fed began quantitative tightening, allowing its massive balance sheet to shrink, further removing liquidity from the financial system. These actions, while aimed at achieving the Fed’s mandate, have not been without controversy. Critics like Senator Lummis argue that the initial stimulus was excessive, leading directly to the inflation problem, and that the subsequent tightening was either too late or too severe, risking a recession. Navigating the Storm: How Do US Inflation Concerns Drive Political Scrutiny? The rising cost of living has become a dominant issue for American households, and these US inflation concerns are a major catalyst for political scrutiny directed at the Federal Reserve. When prices for everyday goods and services—from groceries and gasoline to housing and healthcare—rise significantly, it directly impacts the financial well-being of millions. This tangible pain point translates into immense political pressure on elected officials, who in turn look for accountability from institutions like the Fed. Consider the following impacts of persistent inflation: Economic Impact Description Reduced Purchasing Power Each dollar buys less, eroding savings and real wages. Uncertainty for Businesses Difficulty in planning future investments and pricing strategies. Increased Cost of Borrowing Higher interest rates make loans more expensive for consumers and businesses. Social Discontent Frustration among the public over stagnant wages and rising costs. It’s within this context that calls for leadership changes, such as Senator Lummis’s demand for Jerome Powell’s resignation , gain traction. Lawmakers, responding to their constituents’ struggles, often question whether the Fed is acting swiftly and effectively enough to bring inflation back down to its 2% target. The debate isn’t just about economic theory; it’s about the lived experiences of ordinary Americans and the perceived competence of those in charge of the nation’s economic levers. While the Fed is designed to operate independently of political influence to make objective decisions, its actions inherently have political consequences. When inflation runs hot, the Fed becomes a natural target for criticism, regardless of the underlying causes, which can include global supply chain issues, geopolitical conflicts, or fiscal policy. This dynamic ensures that Fed leadership will always be under intense public and political scrutiny, especially during periods of economic turbulence. What Does This Mean for Crypto Market Stability? The intersection of traditional monetary policy and the burgeoning digital asset space is a crucial one, and any significant shake-up at the Federal Reserve, such as a potential change in leadership, could have notable implications for crypto market stability . Cryptocurrencies, while often seen as an alternative to traditional finance, are not entirely insulated from macroeconomic forces driven by central banks. Here’s how Fed policy and leadership changes can influence the crypto market: Interest Rates and Liquidity: Higher interest rates, a direct result of Fed tightening, tend to make riskier assets like cryptocurrencies less attractive. As the cost of borrowing increases, investors may pull capital from speculative assets to less volatile, yield-bearing traditional investments. Conversely, a more dovish Fed (lower rates, more liquidity) generally bodes well for crypto, as capital seeks higher returns. Investor Sentiment: Uncertainty at the Fed or about the direction of monetary policy can lead to increased volatility across all markets, including crypto. Investors prefer clarity, and a potential change in Fed leadership, particularly under contentious circumstances, would introduce a period of significant uncertainty. Inflation Hedge Narrative: For some, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are viewed as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement. If the market perceives that a new Fed chair or a change in policy is more likely to lead to uncontrolled inflation, this narrative could strengthen, potentially boosting crypto prices. Conversely, if a new leader is seen as highly effective in taming inflation, the “inflation hedge” argument might weaken. Regulatory Outlook: While not directly tied to monetary policy, the broader economic philosophy of a new Fed chair could indirectly influence the regulatory environment for digital assets. A leader more open to innovation or, conversely, more inclined towards strict oversight, could shape future discussions around crypto regulation. The current economic environment, with high inflation and aggressive rate hikes, has undeniably put pressure on the crypto market, contributing to the “crypto winter” experienced recently. A call for Jerome Powell’s resignation , therefore, is not just a political headline; it’s a potential signal of future shifts in monetary policy that crypto investors need to monitor closely. Any pivot in the Fed’s strategy, whether it’s a continuation of tightening or a shift towards easing, will likely send ripples through Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the broader altcoin ecosystem. The Road Ahead: What’s Next for the Fed and the US Economy? The call from Senator Lummis Fed Criticism highlights the intense pressure on the Federal Reserve as it navigates complex economic currents. While a senator’s call for resignation is significant, it’s important to remember that the Fed Chair is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, serving a four-year term. A resignation would typically occur under extreme pressure or personal choice, and such public demands, while impactful, do not automatically trigger a change in leadership. However, the ongoing scrutiny means that every decision made by the Federal Reserve will be met with heightened anticipation and analysis. The path forward involves several key considerations: Inflation Trajectory: The primary focus will remain on whether inflation continues its downward trend towards the Fed’s 2% target. Economic data, particularly the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, will be critical. Interest Rate Decisions: Will the Fed continue to hold rates steady, or are further hikes or cuts on the horizon? This will depend heavily on inflation data and labor market conditions. Economic Growth: The Fed aims for a “soft landing” – bringing down inflation without causing a severe recession. The balance between fighting inflation and sustaining economic growth will be delicate. Political Landscape: As the 2024 election cycle heats up, the Fed’s actions will inevitably become a political talking point, adding another layer of complexity to its decision-making process. The current climate demands astute leadership at the Federal Reserve. Whether Jerome Powell remains at the helm or not, the challenges of managing inflation, maintaining employment, and ensuring financial stability will persist. The economic narrative is continuously evolving, and the decisions made in the coming months will shape the financial futures of millions, influencing everything from the cost of your mortgage to the volatility of your crypto portfolio. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Monetary Policy and Markets Senator Cynthia Lummis’s unequivocal call for Jerome Powell’s resignation underscores a moment of intense scrutiny for the Federal Reserve and its leadership. Her criticism, rooted in deep US inflation concerns and a perceived mismanagement of Federal Reserve policy impact , reflects a broader public and political frustration with the rising cost of living. While the immediate outcome of such a call remains uncertain, it highlights the immense pressure on the Fed to navigate a complex economic landscape. For investors, particularly those in the digital asset space, understanding these dynamics is paramount. The stability of the crypto market stability is inextricably linked to the broader macroeconomic environment shaped by central bank actions. As the debate over monetary policy continues, vigilance and informed decision-making will be key to navigating the opportunities and challenges ahead.

2025-07-10T08:10:38,"Elon Musk’s Grok Predicts XRP Price for the End of 2025","XRP is currently trading at $2.33, up 6.22% from last week, with renewed interest following recent regulatory developments and institutional partnerships. Experts have shared bullish predictions about July for months, and to see if the digital asset will maintain this momentum for the rest of the year, we consulted Elon Musk’s AI system, Grok . After analyzing predictions from market experts and the current state of the market, Grok offered a detailed analysis of XRP’s potential price by the end of 2025, with multiple bullish targets. Grok Mentioned Regulatory and Institutional Developments A major turning point for XRP came in March when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) agreed to withdraw its appeal against Ripple . While the court recently rejected their joint motion, both parties will dismiss their appeals , cementing XRP’s status as a non-security asset. This would provide greater regulatory clarity, and Grok highlighted it as a critical driver of market confidence. Grok also highlighted that Ripple’s partnerships with leading financial institutions such as Santander, SBI Holdings , and Bank of America are increasing XRP’s utility in cross-border payments. The company’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service continues to attract interest from payment processors and banks, enhancing XRP’s real-world application. Grok referenced a prediction of an 88% chance of spot XRP ETF approval by the end of 2025. Bloomberg analysts recently raised the ETF approval probability to 95% , and this development could significantly boost institutional investment. The anticipation surrounding this development mirrors previous rallies triggered by Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF approvals. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Grok’s XRP Price Prediction Technical analysts have also identified bullish patterns, including a cup-and-handle formation and an ascending channel. Grok noted that if XRP breaks resistance levels between $2.40 and $3.40, it could initiate a substantial upward movement. Grok compiled a range of predictions from web sources and analysts. Conservative estimates range from $1.05 to $2.50, citing market volatility and regulatory delays. Moderate forecasts, including those from Cryptomus and InvestingHaven, suggest prices between $2.50 and $5.00. Bullish projections, such as those from Standard Chartered, extend to $5.81 and $5.50, respectively. Some speculative forecasts on social media even suggest values exceeding $15 or $100 , but Grok cautions these are “highly speculative” and imply “unprecedented adoption.” Grok’s Final Estimate Weighing various market drivers and risks, Grok predicts XRP will trade in the $3 to $7 range by the end of 2025, with a likely value near $5. It notes that this estimate balances optimism from potential ETF approval and institutional growth with risks such as market volatility and competition.

2025-07-10T08:00:54,"Bitcoin: CZ’s Bold Insight – Why Now Might Be the Perfect Time to Buy the Dip","In the fast-paced world of digital assets, every word from a prominent figure can send ripples across the global crypto market . Recently, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, widely known as CZ , once again captured the attention of investors with a simple yet powerful message: “Hope you bought the dip.” This statement, delivered via his active X account, came as Bitcoin saw a modest 2% uptick within 24 hours, reminding the community of his consistent bullish outlook, previously articulated on June 23rd: “everything before the next ATH [all-time-high] is a dip.” But what does this mean for the average investor, and is CZ’s optimism a sign to seize the moment? Understanding CZ’s Perspective on Bitcoin and Market Cycles CZ has long been a vocal proponent of Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. His recent comments are not isolated but rather echo a consistent philosophy he has shared with millions of followers over the years. When he suggests that ‘everything before the next ATH is a dip,’ he’s articulating a belief in Bitcoin’s long-term upward trajectory, implying that current price levels, regardless of minor fluctuations, are ultimately low points when viewed against future potential all-time highs. This perspective encourages a long-term investment horizon, rather than short-term trading based on daily volatility. His influence on the crypto market cannot be overstated. Despite stepping down from Binance, CZ remains a highly respected and watched figure. His simple tweets often ignite conversations and can even influence market sentiment, especially among retail investors who look to experienced voices for guidance. His ‘buy the dip’ mantra isn’t just a casual remark; it’s a reflection of a seasoned investor’s strategy for accumulating assets in a volatile market. What Does it Mean to ‘Buy the Dip’ in the Crypto Market? The phrase ‘ buy the dip ‘ is a common investment strategy, particularly prevalent in volatile markets like cryptocurrency. It essentially means purchasing an asset after its price has fallen, with the expectation that the price will rebound and eventually surpass its previous levels. For Bitcoin , this strategy has historically proven effective, given its cyclical nature and consistent recovery from significant downturns. However, it’s not without its risks. Identifying a true ‘dip’ versus a sustained downturn can be challenging. A ‘dip’ implies a temporary correction before a recovery, while a ‘downturn’ could indicate a longer bear market. CZ’s broader definition—’everything before the next ATH is a dip’—suggests a confidence that Bitcoin will always reach new all-time highs, making any current price point an opportunity for accumulation. Key aspects of the ‘buy the dip’ strategy include: Risk Assessment: Understanding that prices can always fall further than anticipated. Long-Term Vision: This strategy is best suited for investors with a long-term outlook, not those seeking quick profits. Capital Allocation: Only investing capital you can afford to lose, as market recovery is never guaranteed. Market Context: Analyzing the broader market sentiment, macroeconomic factors, and fundamental developments of the asset. Strategies for Navigating Bitcoin’s Volatility Towards the Next ATH For those looking to act on CZ’s advice or simply navigate the volatile waters of Bitcoin investment, several strategies can be employed. While CZ’s tweet is a general sentiment, a disciplined approach is crucial. Here are some actionable insights: Strategy Description Benefits Challenges Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) Investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals (e.g., weekly, monthly), regardless of the asset’s price. Reduces risk of buying at peak prices; averages out purchase price over time. May miss out on significant gains if prices surge quickly; requires discipline. Value Averaging Adjusting investment amounts to reach a specific target value for your portfolio at regular intervals. More aggressive ‘buy the dip’ approach; potentially higher returns in volatile markets. Requires more active management; can lead to larger investments during dips. Technical Analysis Using charts and indicators to identify support levels where prices might bounce. Helps in timing entries for ‘dips’; provides data-driven insights. Not foolproof; can be subjective; requires learning complex charting patterns. The ultimate goal for many investors following CZ’s sentiment is to position themselves favorably for the next ATH . This requires not just buying during dips, but also holding through periods of stagnation or further declines, trusting in the long-term growth of the asset. The Broader Crypto Market: Beyond Bitcoin and CZ’s Influence While CZ ‘s comments primarily focus on Bitcoin , his optimism often spills over into the wider crypto market . Bitcoin’s performance typically sets the tone for altcoins, and a bullish outlook on Bitcoin often signals potential for growth across the entire digital asset space. However, it’s crucial to remember that altcoins carry their own unique risks and rewards, often exhibiting higher volatility than Bitcoin. The current market environment is complex, influenced by macroeconomic factors, regulatory developments, and technological advancements within the blockchain space. Investor sentiment, while often buoyed by influential figures, also reacts to these external forces. Understanding the interplay between these elements is key to making informed investment decisions. A dip in one asset might be a buying opportunity, while a dip in another might signal deeper underlying issues. Diversification and thorough research remain paramount. Is the Next All-Time High (ATH) Inevitable for Bitcoin? The question on many investors’ minds is whether Bitcoin ‘s next ATH is truly inevitable, as CZ’s comments suggest. Historically, Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable resilience, recovering from multiple significant drawdowns to reach new peaks. This track record is a major reason for the strong belief among long-term holders and figures like CZ. Factors that could drive Bitcoin to a new ATH include: Halving Cycles: Bitcoin’s supply-reducing halving events have historically preceded bull runs. Institutional Adoption: Increasing interest and investment from traditional financial institutions. Global Macroeconomics: Bitcoin’s role as a potential hedge against inflation or traditional market instability. Technological Advancements: Continuous improvements to the Bitcoin network and its ecosystem. However, no asset’s future is guaranteed. Regulatory crackdowns, unforeseen technological issues, or significant shifts in global finance could impact its trajectory. CZ’s ‘everything before the next ATH is a dip’ should be viewed as a strong statement of confidence based on historical performance and future potential, rather than a guarantee. Conclusion: Seizing Opportunity in the Crypto Market CZ ‘s recent remarks serve as a powerful reminder of the long-term bullish sentiment that permeates much of the cryptocurrency community. His ‘hope you bought the dip’ message, coupled with his belief that ‘everything before the next ATH is a dip,’ encapsulates a strategy focused on accumulation and patience in the face of market volatility. While his words carry significant weight, investors should always combine such insights with their own diligent research, risk assessment, and a clear understanding of their financial goals. The crypto market offers unparalleled opportunities, but navigating it successfully requires a blend of optimism, strategy, and prudence. Whether the current price action constitutes the ‘dip’ before the next major surge, only time will tell, but the conversation ignited by CZ certainly highlights the ongoing potential in the digital asset space.

2025-07-10T08:00:42,"Bitcoin Consolidates Below All-Time High as Spot Market Drives Momentum","Bitcoin’s price movement remains in focus as it continues to consolidate just below its previous all-time high. Despite a brief surge that brought it within range of its $111,000 peak, the asset has struggled to establish a breakout. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $108,927, representing a 0.2% increase over the past 24 hours. The persistence of this consolidation phase comes amid growing market discussions around spot and derivatives behavior. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Liquidity Lifeline Just Got Cut—What You Need To Know Binance Spot-Perpetual Delta Reflects Cautious Leverage One of the more notable on-chain observations comes from CryptoQuant contributor BorisVest, who analyzed the prolonged negative delta between spot and perpetual prices on Binance. According to the analyst, this delta has remained in negative territory since December 2024. That means the spot price of Bitcoin has consistently traded above the perpetual futures price on Binance, an unusual structure during what appears to be a bullish market trend. “When the delta flipped negative last December, Bitcoin had just marked a then-ATH,” BorisVest noted. He explained that this divergence signaled an aggressive buildup of long positions in the perpetual market, just before Bitcoin corrected to $74,000. Despite Bitcoin reaching new highs recently, the delta still hasn’t reversed. “The sustained gap shows that leveraged traders have yet to commit to the rally in full,” he added. This trend could indicate a phase of accumulation in the spot market, which historically precedes stronger price movements. The analyst also warned that when perpetual prices eventually flip above spot prices, it may signal a shift toward a more speculative environment. In such scenarios, sudden price corrections could occur if long positions are unwound rapidly. Traders monitoring the spot-perpetual relationship can potentially use this as a signal to adjust their risk exposure. Dollar Weakness May Signal Tailwinds for Bitcoin Another CryptoQuant analyst, Darkfost, highlighted a macroeconomic trend that could further influence Bitcoin’s trajectory, the weakening US dollar. The US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the value of the dollar relative to a basket of foreign currencies, is currently trading at its most significant deviation below its 200-day moving average in over two decades. This decline coincides with rising US debt levels and has historically aligned with strength in risk-on assets like Bitcoin. Darkfost pointed out that when the dollar loses its traditional safe-haven appeal, capital often flows toward alternative assets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash To $92,000 Or New ATHs?

Long-term forecasts estimate BTC prices could hit $900K by 2030. The Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 is turning increasingly bullish. This surge in optimism is driven by record-breaking inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs , rising institutional interest , and strong political support, including Trump’s plan to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . With companies like GameStop and Trump Media adding BTC to their balance sheets, and the Fed signaling potential rate cuts, investors are asking one critical question: Will Bitcoin go back up and lead the next financial revolution? What is the Bitcoin price prediction for today? The BTC price may range between $107,296.38 and $109,142.23 today.

Hence, we expect the BTC price to create a 2025 high of ~$168,000. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $71,827.81 $119,713.02 $167,598.22 Bitcoin Price Prediction July 2025 Bitcoin’s performance in Q1 2025 was notably lackluster due to tariff-related concerns alongside the rise in tension between Russia and Ukraine. Yet, it made a remarkable comeback in Q2, particularly during April and May. Driven by easing tensions, Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of $112,000 by the third week of May. But, In early June, BTC attempted to hold support near the previous swing low from May after pulling back from its $112K peak. On June 6th, a positive U.S. jobs report and renewed U.S.-China trade talks sparked a brief bounce from the dynamic support of the 50-day EMA. Yet, by June 10th, the momentum began to wane, with increased selling pressure linked to rising geopolitical tensions, particularly between Israel and Iran. The situation escalated on June 17th when President Donald Trump issued a warning to Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei. Following a defiant response from Iran, the U.S. launched attacks on Iranian nuclear sites over the third weekend of June, further worsening the geopolitical landscape. Consequently, Bitcoin briefly dipped to around $98,000 but rebounded after a ceasefire announcement on June 23rd. As of the fourth week of June onwards, Bitcoin’s price has advanced significantly, despite dormant wallet addresses for years resurfacing, showcasing strength in BTC’s rise. The price action throughout June had resembled a continuation pattern known as a “flag pattern”, with the upper border aligning with this supply block. By the second week of July, whale transactions count (>1m USD), whale transactions count (>100K USD), weighted sentiment, and addresses holding coins (10,000 – 100,000) have seen increases. As a result, the border of the flag is breached on the upside and has broken through June’s swing high of $110K. If BTC price holds for a few days above June’s high, then another push would conquer $112K and enter price discovery mode. With several experts suggesting a round-number target of $120,000 next before July ends. Conversely, if bearish pressure mounts and the price reverses below June’s swing high, then the consolidation between the flag upper border and June’s swing high could continue. But, if it slips $107K then it could return to the critical May swing low support zone around $101K. Should this level also fail, then Bitcoin could fall to the flag’s lower border, dragging the price down to the $100,000 to $95,000 range in the near term. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July 2025 $95,000 $103,500 – $108,000 $120,000 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 Recent insights from Santiment highlight that the Israel-Palestine conflict in H2 2024 caused a spike in social volume. Initially, crypto prices dropped, but the market rebounded, leaving panic sellers behind. A similar trend occurred in Q2 2025 when rising Ukraine-Russia tensions led to increased social activity. After a price dip, Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of $112,000. Now, the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict has prompted U.S. intervention, resulting in another surge in social volume. Bitcoin’s price dipped to $98,000, but analysts expect a strong rally in H2 2025. Despite geopolitical challenges in Q1 and Q2, the overall outlook for Bitcoin remains bullish. Source: santiment Looking ahead, advancements in financial products, especially ETF flows, could sustain Bitcoin’s bullish momentum. Market sentiment is optimistic, suggesting Bitcoin may reach new highs. Moreover, the speculation is growing that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates in the U.S., further supporting Bitcoin’s upward movement. Also, pata data is evident of its relationship with global liquidity, as global M2 increases, Bitcoin often experiences price surges. Similarly, the CryptoQuant data also indicates rising accumulation, with exchange reserves declining to 2.4 million BTC, down from 3.1 million BTC a year ago. Ultimately, Bitcoin’s future market potential will depend on buying demand, geopolitical developments, regulatory changes, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Talking about Bitcoin Price Prediction, if things turn bullish, BTC is expected to create a high of $175K. If things go south, we can expect a low of $70K.

2025-07-10T07:57:39,"This Chart Points to a 30% Bitcoin Price Boom Ahead: Technical Analysis","This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. Bitcoin's BTC spot price has surpassed $111,000 and could rise by another 30% to exceed $140,000. That's the message from the daily price chart of BlackRock's Nasdaq-listed spot bitcoin ETF, known by its IBIT ticker, which shows a bull flag breakout. The ETF, mandated to closely track the BTC spot price, rose 2.85% on Wednesday, briefly surpassing the May high of $63.70, according to data source TradingView. The advance reconfirmed the flag breakout seen early this month, a sign that the five-and-a-half-week counter-trend consolidation has ended and the broader uptrend from April lows has resumed. Flags are bullish continuation patterns, and breakouts typically see analysts anticipate a price rally equal to the magnitude of the initial run higher. The so-called measured move method implies at least 30% upside for both IBIT and bitcoin's spot price. Flags have a low failure rate, according to technical analysis theory. That said, the pattern could fail if macro factors take a turn for the worse, pushing prices back into a counter-trend consolidation. Such a move would negate the bullish outlook. As of now, bitcoin's spot price also indicates a bullish setup, suggesting a potential rally to $134,000, according to veteran chart analyst Peter Brandt.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/10/this-chart-points-to-a-30-bitcoin-price-boom-ahead-technical-analysis,"TRADING|BTC|MARKET","Markets|BlackRock|Bitcoin|ETF|Technical Analysis|News",cryptocompare

2025-07-10T07:50:51,"Ethereum ETF Faces Crucial SEC Delay: What It Means for BlackRock’s Spot Plan","Are you closely watching the unfolding drama in the world of cryptocurrency regulation? If so, you’re not alone. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has once again captured headlines, this time with a pivotal decision regarding BlackRock’s ambitious proposal for a spot Ethereum ETF . This isn’t just another regulatory hiccup; it’s a moment that could significantly shape the future of institutional investment in digital assets. The financial world held its breath as news broke: the SEC has officially delayed its decision on BlackRock’s application to allow in-kind creations and redemptions for its proposed spot Ethereum ETF (ETHA). This move, while not entirely unexpected given the SEC’s cautious stance on cryptocurrencies, introduces a fresh wave of uncertainty into a market eagerly awaiting clearer regulatory pathways. But what exactly does this delay signify, and why is the ‘in-kind’ mechanism so important? What Exactly is an Ethereum ETF , and Why Does “In-Kind” Matter So Much? Before diving deeper into the implications of the SEC’s latest move, let’s clarify what an Ethereum ETF is and why the specific ‘in-kind’ mechanism is a focal point of discussion. An Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is a type of investment fund that trades on stock exchanges, much like a stock. A crypto ETF, like the proposed Ethereum ETF, would allow investors to gain exposure to the price movements of Ethereum without directly owning the cryptocurrency itself. This offers a regulated, accessible, and often more secure way for traditional investors to participate in the crypto market. Now, let’s talk about the ‘in-kind’ creation and redemption mechanism, which is at the heart of BlackRock’s proposal and the SEC’s current deliberation. This mechanism contrasts sharply with ‘cash’ creation and redemption: In-Kind Creation: Authorized Participants (APs) – typically large financial institutions – would deliver actual Ethereum to the ETF issuer in exchange for new ETF shares. This means they are trading the underlying asset directly for fund shares. In-Kind Redemption: Conversely, when APs want to redeem ETF shares, they would receive actual Ethereum from the fund’s reserves. Why is this important? The ‘in-kind’ model is generally preferred by ETF issuers and institutional investors because it can offer several benefits: Tax Efficiency: In-kind transfers typically do not trigger taxable events for the fund, potentially leading to better long-term performance for investors. Lower Costs: It can reduce transaction costs and operational complexities compared to cash models, as the fund doesn’t need to buy or sell the underlying asset with fiat currency. Reduced Market Impact: Direct transfers of crypto assets can potentially minimize market impact compared to large cash trades, especially in volatile markets. Conversely, a ‘cash’ creation/redemption model would involve APs exchanging cash for ETF shares, and vice-versa, with the ETF issuer then buying or selling the underlying Ethereum on the open market. The SEC has historically preferred cash-creation models for crypto ETFs, citing concerns about market manipulation and investor protection, as it keeps the fund’s direct interaction with the crypto markets limited. The SEC Delay : A Familiar Roadblock or a New Hurdle? The news of the SEC delay on BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF isn’t an isolated incident; it’s part of a broader pattern of regulatory caution concerning cryptocurrency products. For years, the SEC has been hesitant to approve spot crypto ETFs, citing concerns ranging from market manipulation and liquidity issues to investor protection and the nascent nature of the digital asset market. Let’s look at the historical context: Product Type SEC Stance (Historically) Current Status (General) Bitcoin Futures ETF Approved relatively early (e.g., ProShares BITO in 2021) due to regulation of underlying futures market. Several approved and trading. Spot Bitcoin ETF Repeatedly rejected for years, citing market manipulation concerns and lack of surveillance sharing agreements. Approved in January 2024 after court rulings and significant pressure. Spot Ethereum ETF Under review; similar concerns as Bitcoin, plus debate over ETH’s classification (security vs. commodity). Currently facing delays, no approvals yet. The recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 set a precedent, largely due to a court mandate that the SEC re-evaluate its stance. Many in the industry hoped this would pave the way for a smoother approval process for Ethereum ETFs. However, the SEC’s current delay suggests they are taking a deliberate, cautious approach, possibly waiting for more clarity on Ethereum’s regulatory classification. Is Ethereum a commodity, like Bitcoin, or a security? This fundamental question continues to loom large over any ETF application. Furthermore, the SEC’s concerns often revolve around the underlying spot market’s susceptibility to manipulation, the adequacy of surveillance-sharing agreements with exchanges, and ensuring robust investor protection. While the crypto market has matured significantly, these concerns remain a primary hurdle for new product approvals. What Does This Mean for BlackRock Ethereum ‘s Ambitions? When a financial titan like BlackRock, with trillions of dollars under management, enters the crypto ETF arena, it sends ripples across both traditional finance and the digital asset space. BlackRock’s entry into the Bitcoin spot ETF market was a game-changer, lending immense credibility and institutional weight to the asset class. Their subsequent application for a spot BlackRock Ethereum ETF signaled a strong belief in Ethereum’s long-term potential and its role in the evolving digital economy. For BlackRock, this delay is likely a strategic pause rather than a complete roadblock. They are known for their meticulous approach and deep understanding of regulatory landscapes. While the delay means their proposed ETHA product won’t launch as quickly as some hoped, BlackRock has the resources and expertise to navigate complex regulatory environments. Their persistence in pursuing both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs underscores their conviction that digital assets will become a significant part of mainstream investment portfolios. The impact on BlackRock’s immediate strategy might involve: Continued Engagement: BlackRock will likely continue discussions and provide additional information to the SEC to address any outstanding concerns. Patience and Adaptation: They are prepared for a lengthy process, having seen the protracted battle for Bitcoin spot ETF approvals. Market Signal: Despite the delay, BlackRock’s continued pursuit of an Ethereum ETF sends a powerful signal to other institutional players that Ethereum is a serious contender for broad investment adoption. This delay doesn’t diminish BlackRock’s long-term vision; instead, it highlights the inherent challenges of introducing innovative financial products into a highly regulated space. Understanding the Implications for the Spot Ethereum ETF Market The SEC’s decision to delay BlackRock’s application has broader implications for the entire Spot Ethereum ETF market. Several other prominent asset managers, including Fidelity, Grayscale, VanEck, and ARK 21Shares, also have spot Ethereum ETF applications pending with the SEC. The fate of BlackRock’s application often sets a precedent or indicates the SEC’s general sentiment towards similar proposals. Here’s how this delay impacts the wider spot Ethereum ETF landscape: Industry-Wide Uncertainty: The delay creates a cloud of uncertainty for all applicants. If BlackRock, with its vast resources and influence, faces a delay, it suggests that other applications will likely encounter similar scrutiny and timelines. Extended Timelines: Investors and issuers should now anticipate a longer wait for any spot Ethereum ETF approvals. Initial hopes for approvals by mid-2024 might be pushed further into the year or even into 2025. Market Reaction: While the market reaction to this specific delay has been relatively subdued compared to past regulatory news, prolonged uncertainty could temper investor enthusiasm for Ethereum in the short term. However, the long-term bullish case for institutional adoption remains intact. Focus on Regulatory Clarity: The delay underscores the critical need for clearer regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. Without definitive guidance on how digital assets are classified and regulated, the approval process for new financial products will remain arduous. Ultimately, the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF is seen as a significant catalyst for mainstream adoption, potentially unlocking billions in institutional capital. Each delay, while frustrating, is a step in a complex dance between innovation and regulation. Navigating the Waters: Challenges and Opportunities of In-Kind Redemption The core of BlackRock’s proposal, and a key point of contention for the SEC, revolves around the in-kind redemption mechanism. While beneficial for tax efficiency and operational costs, it also presents unique challenges in the context of cryptocurrency regulation. Challenges of In-Kind Redemption: Custody and Security: Managing direct custody of large amounts of Ethereum for an ETF requires extremely robust security protocols. The SEC needs assurance that these digital assets are protected from hacks, theft, and loss. Valuation and Pricing: Ensuring accurate and fair valuation of Ethereum during in-kind creations and redemptions, especially given crypto market volatility, can be complex. Regulatory Oversight: The SEC’s primary concern is investor protection. They need to be confident that the in-kind mechanism doesn’t expose investors to undue risks, particularly concerning market manipulation or illicit activities on the underlying crypto exchanges. Compliance: Ensuring that all aspects of the in-kind process comply with existing securities laws and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations is a monumental task for both the issuer and the regulator. Opportunities Presented by In-Kind Redemption: Enhanced Market Efficiency: By allowing direct transfers of ETH, the in-kind model can facilitate more efficient arbitrage, helping to keep the ETF’s price closely aligned with its Net Asset Value (NAV). Broader Institutional Access: For institutions that are comfortable with direct crypto exposure but prefer the ETF wrapper for regulatory or operational reasons, the in-kind model offers a more direct link to the underlying asset. Tax Advantages for Investors: As mentioned, the tax efficiency of in-kind transfers can translate into better after-tax returns for investors, making the product more attractive. Legitimization of Crypto: An in-kind spot Ethereum ETF would represent a significant milestone in the legitimization of Ethereum as a mainstream asset class, paving the way for more sophisticated financial products. The SEC’s delay likely stems from a need to thoroughly vet these challenges and ensure that BlackRock’s proposed solutions meet their stringent requirements for investor protection and market integrity. The dialogue between the regulator and the applicant will be crucial in addressing these concerns. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Ethereum ETFs? The immediate future for spot Ethereum ETFs, including BlackRock’s ETHA, now involves a waiting game. The SEC typically has several deadlines for these applications, allowing for extensions and public comment periods. While a delay can be frustrating, it’s a standard part of the regulatory review process, especially for novel financial products. Key factors that could influence the eventual decision include: Clarity on Ethereum’s Classification: A definitive statement from the SEC or other U.S. regulators on whether Ethereum is classified as a commodity or a security would significantly impact the approval process. Political and Legal Pressure: Similar to the Bitcoin spot ETFs, potential political pressure or further legal challenges could influence the SEC’s timeline and ultimate decision. Market Maturity: The continued growth and increasing sophistication of the Ethereum ecosystem and the broader crypto market might eventually ease some of the SEC’s concerns. Industry Dialogue: Ongoing engagement between ETF applicants, crypto exchanges, and the SEC to address surveillance sharing and market manipulation concerns will be vital. While an approval might not happen in the immediate future, the fact that major players like BlackRock are relentlessly pursuing these products indicates a strong belief in their eventual success. The trajectory points towards eventual approval, but the path is undoubtedly winding. Actionable Insights for Investors For investors keenly following the development of Ethereum ETFs, the SEC’s delay offers a moment for reflection and strategic planning: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on official SEC announcements and reputable financial news sources. Regulatory updates can significantly impact market sentiment. Long-Term Perspective: Institutional adoption of crypto is a long game. While short-term delays can cause fluctuations, the underlying trend of traditional finance embracing digital assets remains strong. Diversify: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. The crypto market is inherently volatile. A diversified portfolio, considering both direct crypto holdings and traditional investments, is often a wise approach. Understand the Risks: Even with an ETF, investing in cryptocurrencies carries risks. Do your own research (DYOR) and understand the technology, market dynamics, and regulatory landscape. Consider Alternatives (for now): If you’re eager for Ethereum exposure through a regulated product, consider existing Ethereum futures ETFs or regulated crypto trusts (if available in your jurisdiction) while awaiting spot ETF approvals. Conclusion: A Steely Resolve in the Face of Regulatory Winds The SEC’s decision to delay BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF application, particularly concerning its in-kind creation and redemption mechanism, is a significant moment in the ongoing saga of crypto regulation. It underscores the U.S. regulator’s cautious, deliberate approach to integrating digital assets into mainstream financial products. While frustrating for those eager for immediate institutional adoption, this delay is a testament to the rigorous scrutiny required for products of this magnitude. BlackRock’s unwavering pursuit, alongside other major asset managers, signals a profound long-term commitment to Ethereum and the broader crypto market. The challenges of regulatory clarity, market integrity, and investor protection are formidable, but the opportunities for unlocking vast institutional capital and legitimizing digital assets are equally immense. As the financial world watches, the dialogue between innovation and regulation continues, promising an eventual, albeit protracted, integration of cryptocurrencies into the global investment landscape. The path to a fully regulated and widely accessible spot Ethereum ETF may be longer than anticipated, but the journey continues with unwavering institutional resolve.

2025-07-10T07:47:49,"Bhutan Government Moves $23.73M Bitcoin to Binance Again – Timing the Market?","The Royal Government of Bhutan transferred $23.73 million worth of Bitcoin to the Binance exchange within hours of Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high above $112,000 , continuing the nation’s strategic pattern of selling during price peaks. Arkham Intelligence data shows that the government moved 213 BTC across multiple transactions, with the largest single transfer, worth $23.18 millio n , occurring just two hours before the market close. The latest sales bring Bhutan’s remaining Bitcoin holdings to 11,711 BTC worth $1.3 billion, maintaining its position as the sixth-largest government Bitcoin holder globally. Source: BitcoinTreasuries The timing coincides with Bitcoin’s breakthrough above previous resistance levels, suggesting strategic market analysis drives the nation’s trading decisions rather than random liquidation events. Bhutan has consistently demonstrated superior market timing compared to other sovereign Bitcoin holders, particularly in contrast with Germany’s costly liquidation strategy. The German government’s decision to sell 49,858 BTC at $53,000 per coin in July resulted in an estimated $2.015 billion opportunity loss , as those holdings would now be worth $4.57 billion at current prices. The Himalayan kingdom’s approach differs significantly from El Salvador’s buy-and-hold strategy, with President Nayib Bukele pledging never to sell Bitcoin reserves. El Salvador currently holds 6,233 BTC, worth approximately $693 million, while Bhutan maintains nearly double the holdings, despite periodically making strategic sales during favorable market conditions. Source: NayibTracker Hydro-Powered Mining Empire Funds Strategic Trading Operations Bhutan’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy centers on sustainable mining operations powered by abundant hydroelectric resources from Himalayan rivers. The country began mining Bitcoin in April 2019 when prices traded around $5,000, building reserves through energy-efficient operations that account for over 25% of the nation’s GDP. Druk Holdings and Investments, Bhutan’s sovereign investment arm, has mined 13,011 BTC since its inception, while also diversifying into Ethereum, BNB, and Polygon holdings. The investment vehicle oversees the country’s flagship airline, hydroelectric plants, and various industrial operations beyond cryptocurrency activities. Partnership with Singaporean mining giant Bitdeer expanded Bhutan’s capacity through a 600-megawatt facility in Gedu, positioning the nation among the world’s largest sustainable Bitcoin mining operations. The country’s largest facility operates on the site of a failed $1 billion Education City project, utilizing existing infrastructure for cryptocurrency production.

Smart Money Strategy Outperforms Buy-and-Hold Approaches Bhutan’s calculated selling approach has generated superior returns compared to passive holding strategies employed by other nations. Over the past two months, the government sold 1,696 BTC at an average price of $81,999, capitalizing on price appreciation while maintaining substantial long-term positions. Source: Arkham Intelligence The latest transactions include 208.56 BTC ($23.18 million) and smaller amounts totaling $273,000 and $238,000, executed during optimal market conditions. Additional transfers show sophisticated portfolio management with USDT movements between Binance and Kraken exchanges for operational liquidity. More recently, Gelephu Mindfulness City, Bhutan’s Special Administration Region, announced the inclusion of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and BNB in its official strategic reserves , becoming one of the first jurisdictions to formally recognize digital assets in government portfolios. The autonomous city aims to serve as an economic corridor linking South Asia to Southeast Asia.

2025-07-10T07:30:58,"DXY Breakdown Could Be The Bitcoin Breakout Catalyst – Next Move Loading?","Bitcoin is entering a critical phase as it continues to consolidate just below its all-time high of $112,000, a level it has been unable to reclaim since late May. Despite several attempts to break higher, BTC has consistently found strong demand above key support zones, suggesting that buyers remain firmly in control. Now, with volatility compressing and momentum building, many traders believe a breakout is near. Top analyst Darkfost highlighted a key macro development that could fuel Bitcoin’s next move: the US Dollar Index (DXY) has just recorded its largest deviation below the 200-day moving average in the past 21 years. This weakness comes as US debt reaches a new all-time high, stoking concerns about long-term economic stability. While this setup may seem troubling on the surface, it historically favors risk assets like Bitcoin. Periods of dollar weakness often coincide with rising demand for alternative stores of value. With BTC holding key support and macro forces aligning, the stage appears set for a push into price discovery. Investors now turn their eyes to the $112K barrier—if broken, it could open the gates for a strong rally ahead. Bitcoin Awaits Breakout As Dollar Weakness Builds A Bullish Backdrop Bitcoin and the broader crypto market remain in a state of eerie calm. Price action has stalled, with no clear breakout or breakdown across major assets. Bulls are increasingly optimistic, eyeing a breakout that could send BTC into uncharted territory. Meanwhile, bears maintain a cautious stance, expecting either prolonged consolidation or a sharp correction if key support levels fail. According to Darkfost , macroeconomic conditions could soon tilt the balance. While the US national debt just reached a new all-time high, the US Dollar Index (DXY) is trading at historically weak levels, currently 6.5 points below its 200-day moving average. That marks the largest downside deviation in over two decades. Although such a development might seem troubling for traditional markets, it often signals strength ahead for risk assets like Bitcoin. This inverse correlation between the dollar and Bitcoin is well-documented in traditional finance. When the DXY weakens and loses its safe-haven status, capital tends to rotate into alternative assets, including crypto. Historical data shows that BTC has consistently outperformed during periods when the DXY trades below its 365-day moving average. The current environment mirrors those bullish setups. Despite the favorable macro backdrop, Bitcoin’s price has not yet reacted, continuing to trade below its all-time high. This disconnect may reflect market hesitation or a buildup of momentum before a large move. If history repeats, the dollar’s weakness could soon serve as a catalyst for Bitcoin’s next major rally. BTC Price Holds Steady Below Resistance Bitcoin continues to trade in a tight range just below its all-time high of $112,000, currently hovering around $109,000. As seen in the daily chart, BTC remains confined between two key levels: $103,600 acting as solid support and $109,300 as resistance. Since late May, the price has consolidated within this zone, building pressure for the next significant move. The price action shows a consistent pattern of higher lows, indicating that bulls are stepping in to defend key support levels. The 50-day moving average (blue line) sits below the price at $106,742, reinforcing bullish momentum. Meanwhile, both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages are aligned upward, showing a healthy long-term trend. Despite several attempts, Bitcoin has failed to close convincingly above the $109,300 resistance. A daily breakout above this level with strong volume would likely trigger a rally toward price discovery. On the other hand, if the price drops below $103,600, it could open the door for a deeper correction.

Here Are the Details","US-traded spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) reached a historic milestone on Wednesday, surpassing $50 billion in total net inflows. This achievement is being considered a critical step in Bitcoin's institutionalization process. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Surpass $50 Billion Net Inflow Threshold on Surge of Institutional Demand According to data provider SoSoValue, 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a total of $218 million in net inflows on Wednesday, bringing the total net inflow to $50.16 billion. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen strong momentum in April, May and June, with billions of dollars in uninterrupted capital inflows. BlackRock's IBIT product saw the most inflows of the day, with $125.5 million. Ark & 21Shares' ARKB fund saw net inflows of $56.96 million, while Grayscale's Mini Bitcoin Trust saw net inflows of $15.8 million. Other major providers such as Fidelity, Bitwise, Valkyrie, and Invesco also reported positive inflows. BTC Markets analyst Rachael Lucas commented on this milestone with these words: “Spot Bitcoin ETFs surpassing $50 billion is a defining moment in the institutionalization of Bitcoin. This is not a retail investor frenzy; this is a steady flow of capital from asset managers, corporate treasuries, and wealth management platforms.” According to Lucas, demand for Bitcoin is rising due to both geopolitical tensions and former President Donald Trump's promises of aggressive interest rate cuts. Bitcoin's stable supply and global liquidity make it a prominent asset during this period. However, the real disruptor is the ETF format. “These ETF products are regulated and transparent, making them easily accessible to investors through stock and bond infrastructures. They make participation easy.” On the same day, Bitcoin broke new all-time highs, reaching $112,152. The leading cryptocurrency, which was trading at $110,990 at press time, has gained 2% in the last 24 hours. Spot Ethereum ETFs are also continuing their upward trend.

According to data from Lookonchain, wallet address 0xCB92 opened a 50,000 ETH short position on Hyperliquid, which at one point showed an unrealized profit of over $26 million. But rather than closing the transaction, the trader held on — even adding another 10,000 ETH to the short position even as the price rose. A short position is, in effect, a bet the price will fall . If it rises, the trader loses out. The decision turned out to be costly. As ETH surged, the position was stopped out, and Lookonchain reported the trader realized a loss of $716,000 as of Thursday. The position might have been a hedge against a long position as part of a broader strategy, though the tracked wallet held only a short position. The moves are reminiscent of infamous trader ‘James Wynn,’ whose on-chain antics drew eyes to Hyperliquid among mainstream circles. In May, Wynn built a record-setting $1.25 billion notional long position in bitcoin (BTC) at an average price of $108,243, only to see it collapse as the fell below $105,000 after U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff announcement on EU exports . Multiple liquidations, including a 527 BTC position worth over $55 million and a 421 BTC position worth nearly $44 million, wiped out more than $100 million of Wynn’s holdings over a few days, leaving many wondering if they were witnessing a full-blown gambling addiction.

2025-07-10T07:20:36,"AI Agents: The Transformative Force Unlocking the Future of Enterprise Software","Just as decentralized finance reshaped traditional banking and Bitcoin introduced a new paradigm for digital value, a new wave of AI innovation is poised to redefine enterprise software. The familiar reign of Software as a Service (SaaS) is being challenged, with a bold vision emerging where AI agents become the central operating force, fundamentally altering how businesses and individuals interact with technology. The Revolutionary Shift to AI Agents Dave Park, co-founder and CEO of Narada AI, states, “SaaS is going away.” This isn’t just a provocative statement; it’s a declaration of a fundamental shift in how we conceive and utilize digital tools. Park, speaking on Bitcoin World’s flagship podcast, Equity, envisions a future where the traditional reliance on numerous SaaS applications becomes obsolete. He highlights a critical inefficiency: “The typical knowledge worker today deals with anywhere from 17 to 25 different SaaS tools and portals every day, wasting two and a half hours just manually looking up or updating these systems.” The solution, according to Park, lies in a simplified ecosystem: “We believe in a future where it’ll just be the data, the databases, and AI agents or agentic models that take your request and operate across those silos to get the job done.” This isn’t merely an incremental upgrade; it’s a complete re-imagining of the digital workspace, driven by intelligent automation that understands intent and executes complex tasks autonomously. Understanding Agentic AI: Beyond Traditional Automation What exactly is agentic AI , and how does it differ from the automation we’ve grown accustomed to? Traditional automation typically involves scripting predefined rules or workflows. If a condition is met, a specific action is triggered. Agentic AI, however, goes much further. It involves intelligent software entities that can reason, plan, and execute multi-step tasks across various systems, even when explicit APIs or integrations are missing. They learn and adapt, much like a human assistant would. Narada AI, emerging from UC Berkeley research, has developed what they call “large action models” (LAMs). These are a powerful evolution of large language models (LLMs), designed not just to understand and generate text, but to reason through and complete complex, multi-step tasks across different work tools. The key differentiator is their ability to operate effectively even when direct API connections aren’t available, navigating systems in a more human-like, adaptive manner. To better illustrate the distinction, consider the following comparison: Feature Traditional Automation Agentic AI (e.g., Narada AI) Task Execution Pre-defined, rule-based, rigid workflows. Reasoning, dynamic, adaptive to new situations and goals. Integration Relies heavily on robust APIs; breaks if APIs change. Operates across silos even with missing APIs; learns to navigate interfaces. Problem Solving Limited to known scenarios and explicit instructions. Handles novel, multi-step, complex problems; infers intent. Learning & Adaptation Minimal to none; requires manual updates or re-scripting. Continuously learns and improves from interactions and feedback. User Interaction Requires users to manage multiple interfaces and trigger workflows. Operates autonomously based on high-level requests; user provides goals. The End of SaaS as We Know It? The vision presented by Narada AI suggests a future where the concept of “using” individual apps might become outdated. Instead of opening a CRM, then an email client, then a project management tool, an AI agent could simply receive a high-level request – for example, “Follow up with all leads from last week’s conference who opened the introductory email but haven’t replied, and schedule a call.” The agent would then autonomously navigate across your CRM, email platform, and calendar, executing the necessary steps without direct human intervention across each application. This shift has profound implications for enterprise software . Companies might move away from licensing dozens of distinct SaaS products, instead focusing on robust data infrastructure that AI agents can access and orchestrate. The value proposition shifts from features within an app to the seamless flow of information and execution of tasks across an entire digital ecosystem. Narada AI’s Vision: Powering the Future of Productivity Narada AI is not just talking about this future; they are building it. Their debut at Bitcoin World Disrupt 2024 showcased their large action models, demonstrating a tangible path to overcoming the inefficiencies of current enterprise environments. By enabling agents to reason and act across disparate systems, even those lacking modern APIs, Narada AI directly addresses the “two and a half hours wasted” problem Park identified. While the initial focus might be on large enterprises, the benefits are expected to cascade. Park believes that tools like Narada could eventually empower solopreneurs and smaller teams, leveling the playing field by providing sophisticated automation capabilities previously exclusive to large organizations with dedicated IT departments. Imagine a small business owner able to manage sales, marketing, and customer service with a single intelligent assistant, rather than juggling a dozen subscriptions. Navigating the Agentic AI Landscape: Challenges and Opportunities The timing for this conversation is crucial. Y Combinator’s most recent batch included over 70 agentic startups, signaling a strong belief in this emerging sector. Major players like Grammarly are also investing heavily, building comprehensive AI work stacks through strategic partnerships and acquisitions. This indicates a broad industry recognition of the potential of agentic AI . However, the transition won’t be without its challenges. There are common misunderstandings about automation and the hype surrounding AI. Enterprises need to prepare their data infrastructure, ensure data quality, and establish robust security protocols to safely deploy AI agents at scale. Trust and transparency will be paramount as these agents gain more autonomy. For businesses looking to embrace this future, key actionable insights include: Assess Your Data Landscape: Understand where your data resides and how accessible it is. Clean, well-organized data is the fuel for effective AI agents. Start Small, Think Big: Begin with pilot projects in specific, high-value areas to understand the impact and refine deployment strategies. Invest in AI Literacy: Educate your workforce on the capabilities and limitations of agentic AI, fostering a culture of collaboration with these new digital assistants. Prioritize Security and Governance: As agents gain access to sensitive information and critical systems, robust security frameworks and clear governance policies are essential. The move from SaaS to AI agents represents more than just a technological upgrade; it’s a philosophical shift in how we approach productivity and digital interaction. It promises a future where technology adapts to us, rather than us adapting to technology, freeing up valuable human time for creativity, strategy, and complex problem-solving that only humans can perform.

2025-07-10T07:12:37,"Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction for July 11","After climbing over 3% in the past 48 hours, Bitcoin price is testing the upper range of its recent consolidation near $111,300. However, as the price nears the upper Bollinger Band and horizontal resistance at $112,400, early signs of exhaustion are surfacing. The question now is whether Bitcoin price today can secure a breakout above this resistance or if bulls will step back and allow a short-term correction. What’s Happening With Bitcoin’s Price? BTC price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Bitcoin has surged out of a two-week ascending triangle, supported by a strong trendline from late June. The breakout above $110,000 was accompanied by a volume spike, pushing price into the $111,300–$111,600 region. BTC price dynamics (Source: TradingView) On the daily chart, BTC is approaching the upper Bollinger Band at $112,377, with price currently facing rejection near this line.

2025-07-10T07:08:38,"Why Bitcoin Price Is Up Today?","The post Why Bitcoin Price Is Up Today? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin has officially done it again, breaking past $112,000 and hitting a new all-time high. After a shaky few weeks, the world’s largest cryptocurrency is now not only soaring in price but has also overtaken Alphabet Inc. in market value. With a $2.213 trillion market cap, Bitcoin is once again the talk of Wall Street and the crypto world alike. But what’s pushing this rally? Let’s break it down. US Lawmakers Finally Talk Crypto Clarity One of the biggest drivers behind Bitcoin’s rise is growing support from US policymakers. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently testified before Congress in support of the CLARITY Act, legislation that aims to bring clear rules to the crypto industry. For the first time, all Senators on the panel agreed that crypto is here to stay and needs regulatory clarity. This kind of shift in tone is giving investors fresh hope that the US might finally embrace crypto innovation. Trump’s Big Moves Add Fuel Adding more excitement to the mix, President Donald Trump is pushing for a huge 300 basis point rate cut, the largest in U.S. history. Lower interest rates often push investors toward high-growth assets like Bitcoin, and this move could drive even more capital into crypto markets. Weak Dollar = Strong Bitcoin Another key factor is that the U.S. dollar is losing steam. The Dollar Index (DXY) is trading far below its 200-day average , a level not seen in over two decades. A weaker dollar often encourages investors to move money into alternative assets like Bitcoin, and that’s exactly what we’re seeing now. Institutional Investors Keep Buying On July 9th, Bitcoin ETFs saw fresh net inflows of $215 million , making it five days in a row of steady new money coming in. BlackRock’s IBIT led the pack with $125.6 million, while Ark Investment added $57 million and Grayscale brought in another $15.8 million.

2025-07-10T07:04:30,"Best-Selling Author Ric Edelman Doubles Down on $500,000 Bitcoin (BTC) Price Target As ‘Smart’ Investors Pile In","Personal finance author and investor Ric Edelman is detailing a massively bullish Bitcoin ( BTC ) prediction. In a new interview with Natalie Brunell, Edelman says he believes BTC will increase more than 350% from its current value in less than five years as Bitcoin adoption accelerates and savvy investors buy the dip. “I don’t believe we’re ever going to see a 70% or 80% drawdown again. I wouldn’t say never to a 40% or even a 50% [dip], but there are now so many institutional investors and sovereign wealth funds and hedge funds and family offices … these are smart people, and when you see a significant drop of 20% or 30% they’re going to recognize the buying opportunity for what it is, and that will put a floor unlike we’ve ever seen before. So sure, we’re going to continue to see volatility, but as the asset class matures, that volatility gets less and less.” Edelman predicts more and more investors will add at least a small percentage of BTC to their overall investment portfolio, sending send Bitcoin to $500,000 by 2030. “I’m actually pretty conservative. A lot of other folks say $1 million by 2030. [Founder and executive chairman of software firm Strategy] Michael Saylor says $5 million. But not too many others share their math. I do pretty openly. I’ll tell you very quickly and easily how I get there. If you take a look at the world’s global assets, the total value of everything, the value of stocks, bonds, real estate, gold, oil, commodities, you name it, add up the total value of everything, it’s about $800 trillion. Now if you take the owners of all that stuff, you own a little bit of it, I own a little bit of it, we all own a little bit, if all the owners of all that stuff allocate just 1% of their portfolio to Bitcoin that would be a flow of $8 trillion. That would put Bitcoin at $500,000, simple as that.” Bitcoin is trading for $111,087 at time of writing, up 2% in the last 24 hours.

2025-07-10T07:00:49,"Is Ripple Turning Into an XRP Treasury Company? Bitwise CEO Wonders","The post Is Ripple Turning Into an XRP Treasury Company? Bitwise CEO Wonders appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple is making headlines again. The company has officially teamed up with BNY Mellon, the world’s largest custodian bank, to safeguard the reserves for its stablecoin RLUSD. The stablecoin has already crossed $500 million in circulation, and this move marks a big milestone for Ripple’s growing payments and stablecoin business. The news didn’t go unnoticed. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley stirred conversation online, wondering aloud if Ripple might soon be seen as an “XRP treasury company.” His post got a mixed response and while some called it a big bet on Ripple’s future, others thought it felt a bit overhyped. I wonder if in 12 months, people will call Ripple an XRP treasury company. — Hunter Horsley (@HHorsley) July 10, 2025 In a recent interview with CNBC, Horsley spoke about why he thinks 2025 will be a major turning point for crypto. For years, uncertainty around crypto regulations in the U.S. has made investors hesitate. But according to Horsley, that’s finally changing. He said lawmakers, regulators, and even the White House are starting to take a more open, constructive approach toward digital assets. He compared the crypto market’s moment to when the iPhone first arrived, met with skepticism, but eventually became a standard tool in every workplace. Horsley said that the market will soon see Bitcoin, XRP, and other digital assets making their way into mainstream businesses and services, not just crypto exchanges. However, previously, Horsley had shared a different view about the U.S. crypto reserve plan announced by President Trump in March. While the reserve is expected to include top cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano along with Bitcoin, Horsley believed Bitcoin alone should have been the focus. In short, between Ripple’s new partnership and growing support from regulators, it feels like crypto might finally be heading toward the mainstream spotlight.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/is-ripple-turning-into-an-xrp-treasury-company-bitwise-ceo-wonders/,"XRP|REGULATION|BTC|FIAT|BUSINESS","News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

He added that the banks face an “unprecedented challenge,” in that they cannot print Bitcoin to defend their currency, which creates a “policy trilemma.” Policymakers essentially have three choices: they can raise interest rates to defend the currency through higher yields, deplete foreign currency reserves to support the domestic currency, or they can “join the migration,” and purchase Bitcoin themselves, “legitimizing the very trend they’re trying to counter,” according to Livingston. “This represents a fundamental shift in the balance of power between Bitcoin and governments. The free market is going to win.” Bitcoin has effectively cornered the world’s central banks and there is no way out. The banks face an unprecedented challenge: they cannot print Bitcoin to defend their currency. This creates a policy trilemma where authorities must choose between: Raise Interest Rates:… — Adam Livingston (@AdamBLiv) July 9, 2025 Devaluation of Fiat There are only a handful of countries that have adopted a national strategic Bitcoin reserve. El Salvador and Bhutan are the two official ones with 6,089 and 13,029 BTC held, respectively. While several others, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, China, and Ukraine, are unofficially holding the asset but have not declared national reserves. “The era of fiat optionality is quietly closing, and the game theory around sovereign adoption is heating up,” said crypto YouTuber ‘Professor Crypto.’ Renowned analysts and crypto entrepreneurs such as Anthony Pompliano, Willy Woo, and Arthur Hayes have all predicted that fiat devaluation through money printing will continue. “The main reason why Bitcoin was made is debasement, fiat money printing by central banks, resulting in hyperinflation,” said Woo in June. “All major governments are too far in debt; they will have to print and monetize to repay it,” stated Kalypsus Research on Thursday. “This is why investors are rotating to Bitcoin. It can’t be devalued by governments printing more money.” China Media Expect More Fiscal Stimulus: BBG The amount of global debt that will be issued in the next decade will double the current debt load, and central banks will be monetizing it all. — zerohedge (@zerohedge) July 10, 2025 Slow Adoption, CBDC Push However, central banks are not likely to rush into embracing Bitcoin just yet. The job of a central bank is to dictate monetary policy, price stability, and control the flow of funds within an economy, which includes its citizens. Bitcoin represents a significant threat to their control mechanisms because people can transact between themselves or through decentralized exchanges without banking and government oversight or control. The problem is when users want to cash out to fiat, and that is when the banks can regain authority by controlling exit ramps as the chokepoint for governments to exert influence. Many countries allow regulated crypto trading, which can be taxed , and often restrict crypto payments , which circumvent the banking system. Additionally, central banks also fear loss of control over the money supply, especially with stablecoins and crypto-dollarization. This is why many are pursuing CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies), Pakistan being the most recent, as highly controllable digital alternatives.

You might also like: Ex-SHIB and DOGE whales move entire bags into XYZVerse, eyeing 1000x gains Bitcoin shows consistent growth Source: TradingView Bitcoin ( BTC ) has been on an upward trend over the past six months, recording a 12.29% price increase. In the last month, it gained 4.33%, while the past week saw a modest rise of 0.5317%. This consistent growth reflects positive momentum in the market. Currently, Bitcoin is trading between $106,072 and $111,488, slightly above its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $109,104 and $108,716 respectively. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 52.17, indicating neutral market sentiment. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is at 165.20, which may hint at a potential bullish trend. If Bitcoin breaks through the nearest resistance level at $113,748, it could target the next resistance at $119,164, representing a potential gain of about 5%. Conversely, if the price falls below the immediate support at $102,915, it might drop to the second support level at $97,498, a decrease of approximately 5%. Given the current indicators, Bitcoin may continue its gradual ascent, but key levels should be watched closely. Ethereum maintains stability Source: TradingView Ethereum’s price ( ETH ) has seen modest gains recently. Over the past week, it increased by 3.07%, and over the past month, it’s up by 3.97%. However, over the last six months, the price is down by 23.71%. Currently, Ethereum is trading between $2,419.79 and $2,680.77, close to its 10-day simple moving average of $2,572.70. Technical indicators suggest a potential upward trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 61.06, indicating positive momentum but not overbought conditions. The MACD level is positive at 12.3961, showing bullish momentum. The nearest resistance level is at $2,789. If Ethereum breaks above thislevel, it could aim for the second resistance at $3,050, which would represent an increase of approximately 14% from current prices. On the downside, the nearest support is at $2,267.52, and if the price falls below this, it could drop to the second support at $2,006.54, a decrease of around 19%. Given the recent gains and positive technical signals, Ethereum may continue to rise in the short term. Breaking above the resistance levels could lead to significant percentage increases, potentially recovering some of the losses from the past six months. Traders will watch closely to see if Ethereum can sustain this upward momentum.

The company holds $2 million in Bitcoin, and plans to add six more cryptocurrencies as part of the Trump family’s crypto treasury strategy. Bloomberg reports that he bought them on his advisor’s recommendation and has no other role in the company. The news comes after a $6 million private stock deal led by Dominari Securities, where Trump Jr. and his brother Eric are advisors to the parent company. Thumzup Expands Crypto Strategy with Six New Digital Assets In a latest press release , the company announced that the board has officially approved a plan to expand the company’s crypto holdings. The company will start buying and holding more cryptocurrencies, specifically Dogecoin, Litecoin, Solana, XRP, Ethereum, and USDC, as part of its financial strategy. In November 2024, Thumzup’s board approved using Bitcoin as a treasury asset, allowing up to $1 million in BTC purchases. It also filed with the SEC to raise up to $200 million through debt and equity to boost its Bitcoin purchases. Stock Drops 14% Thumzup, which pays users to promote products on Instagram, reported just $151 in revenue and a $2.2 million loss in Q1 2025. The company started buying bitcoin in January. It now holds 19.106 BTC worth $2.1 million and allows up to 90% of its liquid assets in crypto. However, the company’s stock dropped over 14% on Wednesday as investors responded to its increased crypto exposure. Some analysts have raised concerns over the rise of companies holding Bitcoin as a treasury asset. They question whether this trend is sustainable or just a phase that could fade and trigger a major market downturn. Trump Family’s Crypto Trail Donald Trump Jr.’s move into Thumzup is the latest in the Trump family’s growing involvement in crypto. Back in March, Eric Trump had joined the advisory board of Metaplanet, a Japanese company shifting its reserves into Bitcoin. In a recent move, Trump Media & Technology Group has also filed to launch a new crypto ETF that will invest in several tokens, including Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, and Ripple. In June, Trump Media also filed with the SEC to launch the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF, a fund that directly holds Bitcoin and tracks its price. The company is also putting $2.5 billion into building its own Bitcoin treasury. Speaking at the 2025 Bitcoin Conference, Donald Trump Jr. said, “We’re serious about crypto and Bitcoin. We’re in three big deals and just getting started.

According to Bloomberg , Trump Jr. acquired 350,000 shares of the Los Angeles-based company, valued at over $4 million at the time of disclosure. Notably, the purchase was made following a recommendation from his investment adviser, and he has no active role within the company. The stake was revealed shortly after a $6 million private placement of convertible preferred stock, arranged by Dominari Securities, where both Donald Jr. and his brother Eric Trump serve as advisers to the parent company.

By January 2025, Thumzup doubled down on its strategy, increasing its holdings to 19.106 BTC, then valued at approximately $2 million, and authorizing up to 90% of its surplus cash for Bitcoin allocation. It has also paid some of its Associate Salesperson Program participants in Bitcoin as part of its adoption strategy. As previously reported by crypto.news, Thumzup recently amended its universal shelf registration filing with the SEC to be able to raise up to $500 million over the next three years. While the registration is not yet effective, the company has disclosed plans to allocate some of the proceeds to expand its Bitcoin treasury.

In a recent post shared on the Trump-backed social media’s official account, the platform indicated that it plans to launch a utility token “in the near future.” Based on the post, Trump Media is in the beta phase of testing its new Truth+ subscription plan called the Patriot Package. Users who subscribe to the Patriot Package will be able to accumulate rewards through their social media account that will be tied to the utility token. “Based on their level of engagement with the platforms, Patriot Package subscribers will accumulate gems on their Truth Social accounts.

At the moment, the social media platform is offering users a free trial of the Patriot Package on its beta test link. In addition, the platform is also asking users for feedback on gem designs for the rewards program. The gems will be linked to the utility token, which has yet to be revealed.

2025-07-10T06:30:27,"Bitcoin Rally Ahead? DXY Breakdown Suggests Capital Shift To Risk-On Assets","The US national debt recently hit a new all-time high (ATH), surging above $36.5 trillion and putting significant pressure on the US Dollar Index (DXY). As the DXY struggles under the weight of mounting debt, crypto analysts believe capital may soon shift to risk-on assets like Bitcoin (BTC). DXY Breakdown Suggests Bitcoin Rally According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Darkfost, the DXY has dropped to a historically weak level, currently trading 6.5 points below its 200-day moving average (MA) – the largest deviation in the past 21 years. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Floor Rises Toward $100,000, Reinforcing Bullish Sentiment For the uninitiated, the DXY measures the value of the US dollar relative to a basket of six major foreign currencies, including the euro, yen, pound, Canadian dollar, Swedish krona, and Swiss franc. It is widely used as an indicator of USD strength or weakness and often influences investor sentiment across global financial markets. While a breakdown in the DXY might seem alarming at first, it historically benefits risk-on assets like BTC. A weakening dollar typically precedes capital rotation into alternative asset classes. Following that logic, the recent softness in the USD could prompt investors to reassess their portfolios – potentially increasing allocation to digital assets. Darkfost illustrated this point with the below chart. The chart highlights periods where the DXY traded below its 365-day MA. Historically, these phases have aligned with strong BTC price appreciation. The analyst added: We are currently in a phase where the weakness of the DXY could fuel a new rise in BTC but the price didn’t reacted yet. This tool serves as a valuable indicator for identifying early bull market phases and periods of euphoria, not because of pure technical triggers, but because it reflects increasing liquidity potentially flowing into crypto markets. According to data from CoingGecko, BTC is currently trading just about 2.2% below its ATH of $111,814 recorded on May 22. With BTC decisively breaking through a bullish flag, the flagship cryptocurrency looks set to hit a new ATH in the near-term. Some Warning Signs To Watch Out For Despite a favorable macro backdrop, several warning signs could dampen BTC’s bullish momentum. For instance, Bitcoin’s Apparent Demand metric has recently turned negative. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Dominance Signals Weak Hands Capitulating, Strong Hands Rising Similarly, some on-chain metrics suggest that the BTC rally may be running out of steam. Bitcoin’s NVT Golden Cross recently showed signs of a potential local top.

At press time, BTC trades at $109,520, up 0.7% over the past 24 hours.

Meanwhile, following a successful retest around $104,400, analyst Rekt Capital confirmed the downtrend is over, with targets now set at $120K and beyond. Bitcoin has officially made a new all-time high, achieving a market value of $112,152 just 30 minutes ago. Unsurprisingly, many retailers had been dropping out due to boredom or disbelief over the past few days. History has shown that this is a prime sign of a potential… pic.twitter.com/r1IQWqZcG3 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) July 9, 2025 Adding to the bullish mood, Santiment noted that retail FUD has historically signaled breakout moments, with smart money typically buying into the fear. Today’s pattern reflects that trend, pointing to further upside as BTC trades solidly above $112K . Altcoins Join the Rally The bullish momentum isn’t limited to Bitcoin. Several altcoins are rallying, led by Stellar (XLM), which jumped 11.7% amid renewed interest in its cross-border payments use case. Lido DAO (LDO) gained 11.1% as demand for liquid staking solutions grew. Memecoins are also seeing action, Dogwifhat (WIF) and Pepe (PEPE) both surged nearly 11%, showing speculative interest remains strong. Ripple’s XRP rose over 5%, while Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA) all climbed 4–6%, backed by increased trading volumes and broader market optimism. Sentiment was further boosted by corporate crypto endorsements from firms like GameSquare and SharpLink Gaming. Short Liquidations At Play A significant part of Bitcoin’s move is being fueled by liquidations. In the past 24 hours, $465 million worth of short positions were wiped out, pushing prices higher. Total liquidations reached $529 million, showing the force of the short squeeze. Bitcoin’s daily trading volume jumped 45% to over $60 billion, while futures open interest rose to $79 billion, reflecting growing bullish sentiment. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Changpeng Zhao’s YZi Labs Launches BNB-Based Treasury Company , Crypto Week On the Roll Adding fuel to the rally, Congress is gearing up for “ Crypto Week ” from July 14–19, where lawmakers plan to push forward major crypto-related legislation. Key among them are the CLARITY Act , which would clarify jurisdiction between the SEC and CFTC, and the GENIUS Act , targeting stablecoin regulation. Leaders like Ripple’s Brad Garlinghouse and Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong are urging Congress to act fast. Institutional and Macro Tailwinds Strengthen Rally Institutional confidence is also rising, with crypto assets appearing on more corporate balance sheets. Spot Ethereum ETFs have seen over $2 billion in inflows, showing growing demand for regulated exposure to crypto. Macro trends are playing a big role too; the weakening U.S. dollar and delayed tariffs are making risk assets more attractive. As global equities rally on tech and AI enthusiasm, crypto is moving in sync, with Bitcoin’s resilience highlighting renewed investor trust. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The initiative will test 19 pilot programs using real money and assets for the first time, alongside five proof-of-concept trials involving simulated transactions.</p><p>The trials span various asset classes, including fixed income, private markets, trade receivables, and carbon credits. Settlement methods will explore CBDCs, stablecoins, bank deposit tokens, and innovative applications of existing commercial bank deposits held at the RBA. Testing will occur over the next six months using platforms such as Hedera, Redbelly, R3 Corda, and Canvas Connect, with a final report expected in the first half of 2026.</p><p>RBA Assistant Governor Brad Jones said the selected use cases will help assess how both central bank and private digital money, alongside payments infrastructure, could enhance Australia's wholesale financial markets. The RBA remains focused on wholesale applications, having found limited economic justification for a retail digital currency. Expected benefits include lower risks, improved transparency, better collateral efficiency, and cost reductions.</p>
