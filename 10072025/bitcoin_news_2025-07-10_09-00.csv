2025-07-10T06:44:13,"Bitcoin Forces Global Policy Trilemma on Central Banks","“Bitcoin has effectively cornered the world’s central banks, and there is no way out,” said author Adam Livingston on July 9. He added that the banks face an “unprecedented challenge,” in that they cannot print Bitcoin to defend their currency, which creates a “policy trilemma.” Policymakers essentially have three choices: they can raise interest rates to defend the currency through higher yields, deplete foreign currency reserves to support the domestic currency, or they can “join the migration,” and purchase Bitcoin themselves, “legitimizing the very trend they’re trying to counter,” according to Livingston. “This represents a fundamental shift in the balance of power between Bitcoin and governments. The free market is going to win.” Bitcoin has effectively cornered the world’s central banks and there is no way out. The banks face an unprecedented challenge: they cannot print Bitcoin to defend their currency. This creates a policy trilemma where authorities must choose between: Raise Interest Rates:… — Adam Livingston (@AdamBLiv) July 9, 2025 Devaluation of Fiat There are only a handful of countries that have adopted a national strategic Bitcoin reserve. El Salvador and Bhutan are the two official ones with 6,089 and 13,029 BTC held, respectively. While several others, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, China, and Ukraine, are unofficially holding the asset but have not declared national reserves. “The era of fiat optionality is quietly closing, and the game theory around sovereign adoption is heating up,” said crypto YouTuber ‘Professor Crypto.’ Renowned analysts and crypto entrepreneurs such as Anthony Pompliano, Willy Woo, and Arthur Hayes have all predicted that fiat devaluation through money printing will continue. “The main reason why Bitcoin was made is debasement, fiat money printing by central banks, resulting in hyperinflation,” said Woo in June. “All major governments are too far in debt; they will have to print and monetize to repay it,” stated Kalypsus Research on Thursday. “This is why investors are rotating to Bitcoin. It can’t be devalued by governments printing more money.” China Media Expect More Fiscal Stimulus: BBG The amount of global debt that will be issued in the next decade will double the current debt load, and central banks will be monetizing it all. — zerohedge (@zerohedge) July 10, 2025 Slow Adoption, CBDC Push However, central banks are not likely to rush into embracing Bitcoin just yet. The job of a central bank is to dictate monetary policy, price stability, and control the flow of funds within an economy, which includes its citizens. Bitcoin represents a significant threat to their control mechanisms because people can transact between themselves or through decentralized exchanges without banking and government oversight or control. The problem is when users want to cash out to fiat, and that is when the banks can regain authority by controlling exit ramps as the chokepoint for governments to exert influence. Many countries allow regulated crypto trading, which can be taxed , and often restrict crypto payments , which circumvent the banking system. Additionally, central banks also fear loss of control over the money supply, especially with stablecoins and crypto-dollarization. This is why many are pursuing CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies), Pakistan being the most recent, as highly controllable digital alternatives.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only.

XYZVerse is catching the eye of investors as its presale approaches the impressive $15 million mark. The momentum in the major coins is sparking a shift towards altcoins, and XYZVerse is positioning itself as one to watch in this dynamic market. XYZVerse presale close to completion, poised for major CEX listing XYZVerse (XYZ) is a memecoin that has garnered attention with its ambitious goal of increasing its value from $0.0001 to $0.1 during its presale. It has currently raised nearly $15 million, reaching the halfway point of its target, with the XYZ token priced at $0.003333. The token’s value is set to increase to $0.005 in the upcoming 13th stage of the presale, offering early investors an opportunity for a greater discount. XYZVerse is designed for ambitious crypto degens seeking substantial profits. It targets those with a relentless drive for dominance, embodying a fighter’s mindset that resonates with athletes and sports fans. The XYZ token appeals to thrill-seekers looking for the next major memecoin. At the core of the XYZVerse narrative is XYZepe, a fighter in the competitive memecoin arena. XYZepe battles to ascend the charts on CoinMarketCap, with the ultimate goal of achieving the success of established cryptocurrencies like DOGE or SHIB.

In the last month, it gained 4.33%, while the past week saw a modest rise of 0.5317%. This consistent growth reflects positive momentum in the market. Currently, Bitcoin is trading between $106,072 and $111,488, slightly above its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $109,104 and $108,716 respectively. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 52.17, indicating neutral market sentiment. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is at 165.20, which may hint at a potential bullish trend. If Bitcoin breaks through the nearest resistance level at $113,748, it could target the next resistance at $119,164, representing a potential gain of about 5%. Conversely, if the price falls below the immediate support at $102,915, it might drop to the second support level at $97,498, a decrease of approximately 5%. Given the current indicators, Bitcoin may continue its gradual ascent, but key levels should be watched closely. Ethereum maintains stability Source: TradingView Ethereum’s price ( ETH ) has seen modest gains recently. Over the past week, it increased by 3.07%, and over the past month, it’s up by 3.97%. However, over the last six months, the price is down by 23.71%. Currently, Ethereum is trading between $2,419.79 and $2,680.77, close to its 10-day simple moving average of $2,572.70. Technical indicators suggest a potential upward trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 61.06, indicating positive momentum but not overbought conditions. The MACD level is positive at 12.3961, showing bullish momentum. The nearest resistance level is at $2,789. If Ethereum breaks above thislevel, it could aim for the second resistance at $3,050, which would represent an increase of approximately 14% from current prices. On the downside, the nearest support is at $2,267.52, and if the price falls below this, it could drop to the second support at $2,006.54, a decrease of around 19%. Given the recent gains and positive technical signals, Ethereum may continue to rise in the short term. Breaking above the resistance levels could lead to significant percentage increases, potentially recovering some of the losses from the past six months. Traders will watch closely to see if Ethereum can sustain this upward momentum.

According to Bloomberg , Trump Jr. acquired 350,000 shares of the Los Angeles-based company, valued at over $4 million at the time of disclosure. Notably, the purchase was made following a recommendation from his investment adviser, and he has no active role within the company. The stake was revealed shortly after a $6 million private placement of convertible preferred stock, arranged by Dominari Securities, where both Donald Jr. and his brother Eric Trump serve as advisers to the parent company. Thumzup, which operates an app that pays users to promote products on platforms like Instagram, has posted minimal revenue alongside net losses. In the first quarter of 2025, the firm reported a $2.2 million loss on just $151 in revenue. Despite the financial performance, the firm has attracted attention due to its Bitcoin-forward treasury strategy. You might also like: BREAKING: Bitcoin price hits record high as ETF demand overwhelms bearish market setup Thumzup’s involvement with Bitcoin began in November 2024, when its board approved plans to purchase up to $1 million in BTC to diversify corporate reserves at a time when institutional support for Bitcoin was taking off and massive inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs were making headlines. By January 2025, Thumzup doubled down on its strategy, increasing its holdings to 19.106 BTC, then valued at approximately $2 million, and authorizing up to 90% of its surplus cash for Bitcoin allocation. It has also paid some of its Associate Salesperson Program participants in Bitcoin as part of its adoption strategy. As previously reported by crypto.news, Thumzup recently amended its universal shelf registration filing with the SEC to be able to raise up to $500 million over the next three years. While the registration is not yet effective, the company has disclosed plans to allocate some of the proceeds to expand its Bitcoin treasury. The Trumps and crypto For the Trump family, the move builds on a steady progression of crypto-linked activity. Beyond their roles at Dominari , Eric Trump recently joined the advisory board of Metaplanet, a Japanese firm known for holding Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Meanwhile, Trump Media & Technology Group, parent to Truth Social, has raised $2.3 billion with plans to allocate funds toward Bitcoin. At the same time, their venture World Liberty Financial, launched by Donald Trump and his sons, has issued a stablecoin , recently attracted over $100 million from a UAE fund , and reportedly generated tens of millions in revenue .

In a recent post shared on the Trump-backed social media’s official account, the platform indicated that it plans to launch a utility token “in the near future.” Based on the post, Trump Media is in the beta phase of testing its new Truth+ subscription plan called the Patriot Package. Users who subscribe to the Patriot Package will be able to accumulate rewards through their social media account that will be tied to the utility token. “Based on their level of engagement with the platforms, Patriot Package subscribers will accumulate gems on their Truth Social accounts. These will eventually be tied to a utility token on both Truth Social and Truth+,” wrote the platform in its post . You might also like: Trump’s Truth+ wants to add crypto wallet and utility token for subscriptions The Patriot Package consists of a TV streaming plan with 12 “premium, non-woke news channels” as well as what it claims to be a wide selection of video-on-demand services. The subscription plan also extends beyond Truth+ and into Truth Social with red-check verified accounts, boosted comments and an exclusive Truth+ account. At the moment, the social media platform is offering users a free trial of the Patriot Package on its beta test link. In addition, the platform is also asking users for feedback on gem designs for the rewards program. The gems will be linked to the utility token, which has yet to be revealed. Earlier in April, the Trump Media & Technology Group first brought up the concept of introducing utility tokens in a letter written for shareholders. In the document, CEO and Chairman of Trump Media Devin Nunes revealed that the company was exploring the addition of a utility token and digital wallet for its streaming platform, Truth+. The token is meant to be used to pay for Truth+ subscription costs and later on, its utility will extend towards a suite of other products and services under the Trump Media umbrella. Aside from Truth Social, the token’s could possibly apply to the company’s financial technology and financial services branch Truth.Fi. Most recently, the U.S. SEC accepted Trump Media’s application to list and trade shares of its Truth Social Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) ETF.

2025-07-10T06:30:27,"Bitcoin Rally Ahead? DXY Breakdown Suggests Capital Shift To Risk-On Assets","The US national debt recently hit a new all-time high (ATH), surging above $36.5 trillion and putting significant pressure on the US Dollar Index (DXY). As the DXY struggles under the weight of mounting debt, crypto analysts believe capital may soon shift to risk-on assets like Bitcoin (BTC). DXY Breakdown Suggests Bitcoin Rally According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Darkfost, the DXY has dropped to a historically weak level, currently trading 6.5 points below its 200-day moving average (MA) – the largest deviation in the past 21 years. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Floor Rises Toward $100,000, Reinforcing Bullish Sentiment For the uninitiated, the DXY measures the value of the US dollar relative to a basket of six major foreign currencies, including the euro, yen, pound, Canadian dollar, Swedish krona, and Swiss franc. It is widely used as an indicator of USD strength or weakness and often influences investor sentiment across global financial markets. While a breakdown in the DXY might seem alarming at first, it historically benefits risk-on assets like BTC. A weakening dollar typically precedes capital rotation into alternative asset classes. Following that logic, the recent softness in the USD could prompt investors to reassess their portfolios – potentially increasing allocation to digital assets. Darkfost illustrated this point with the below chart. The chart highlights periods where the DXY traded below its 365-day MA. Historically, these phases have aligned with strong BTC price appreciation. The analyst added: We are currently in a phase where the weakness of the DXY could fuel a new rise in BTC but the price didn’t reacted yet. This tool serves as a valuable indicator for identifying early bull market phases and periods of euphoria, not because of pure technical triggers, but because it reflects increasing liquidity potentially flowing into crypto markets. According to data from CoingGecko, BTC is currently trading just about 2.2% below its ATH of $111,814 recorded on May 22. With BTC decisively breaking through a bullish flag, the flagship cryptocurrency looks set to hit a new ATH in the near-term. Some Warning Signs To Watch Out For Despite a favorable macro backdrop, several warning signs could dampen BTC’s bullish momentum. For instance, Bitcoin’s Apparent Demand metric has recently turned negative. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Dominance Signals Weak Hands Capitulating, Strong Hands Rising Similarly, some on-chain metrics suggest that the BTC rally may be running out of steam. Bitcoin’s NVT Golden Cross recently showed signs of a potential local top. That said, Bitcoin continues to show resilience, absorbing persistent selling pressure in the derivatives market and avoiding a breakdown below the $100,000 mark. At press time, BTC trades at $109,520, up 0.7% over the past 24 hours.

However, the outlook against its rival, dogecoin, doesn't look as promising. SHIB has gained 5.2% in the past 24 hours, reaching a high of $0.00001255 on Coinbase, the level last seen on June 12. As of writing, the cryptocurrency teased a breakout into bullish territory above the widely tracked 50-day simple moving average (SMA) at $0.00001242. Key AI insights based on the 24-hour price action Institutional flows drove prices from $0.00001215 to a peak of $0.00001250 between 19:00 and 20:00 on July 9, with an exceptional institutional volume of 1.25 trillion tokens. Strong institutional resistance has been established around the $0.00001250 level, significantly exceeding the average daily institutional volume of 491 billion tokens. An additional 2.54% institutional gains occurred during the final trading hour from July 10, 03:56 to 04:55, advancing from $0.00001244 to $0.00001247. A session low of $0.00001238, established around 04:15, indicates what institutional traders view as strong technical support within the $0.00001238-$0.00001240 range. SHIB/BTC breakout The SHIB/BTC pair listed on CoinEx, which represents SHIB's BTC-denominated price, rose 3.70% Wednesday (UTC), rising out of a triangular consolidation pattern identified by trendlines connecting June 24 and July 3 highs and June 22, June 27 and July 4 lows, according to data source TradingView. The breakout follows a prolonged year-long downtrend and indicates that the bulls have emerged victorious, having successfully absorbed supply during the triangular consolidation. The pair, therefore, could continue to gain ground in the short term, supported by a positive MACD histogram, which points to a strengthening of upward momentum. The swing low from May 7, represented by the horizontal line on the chart below, could offer resistance on the way higher. SHIB/DOGE breaks down SHIB could underperform DOGE in the coming days, as the Binance-listed SHIB/BTC pair has penetrated a trendline support, marking the end of the recovery rally from May lows. Furthermore, the Guppy multiple moving average indicator appears poised to cross bearish, indicating a negative shift in momentum. The bear cross occurs when the band of short-term exponential moving averages (EMAs) moves below the long-term EMAs. The pair needs to top the June 24 high of 0.0000719 to negate the bearish outlook.

2025-07-10T06:00:41,"Crypto Craze Among Russian Investors Surges Past 50% Mark: Study","More than half of Russia’s top investors have already dipped a toe into crypto, and most of the rest plan to follow suit. That’s the headline result of a recent survey of 1,500 qualified investors aged over 20 in cities with more than 100,000 residents. Each participant holds at least ₽50,000 (about $600) in financial assets. Based on reports , 52% of these investors say they’ve bought digital coins, while another 38% intend to do so. Taken together, that means 90% of the surveyed group has either embraced crypto or will likely jump in soon. Qualified Investors Face High Entry Barriers According to the survey, Russia’s authorities aren’t ready to let everyone trade digital assets. In March, the Bank of Russia proposed an “experimental legal regime” that would limit direct crypto trading to “highly qualified investors.” To qualify, individuals would need an annual income of at least ₽50 million (over $600,000) and at least ₽100 million (more than $1.2 million) in securities or deposits. Those thresholds still await final approval, but they make it clear that only a small fraction of the population could ever join. Regulated Next Steps And New Products While the central bank has no plans to add Bitcoin to its own reserves, it has opened the door to non‑deliverable crypto derivatives. That means qualified investors can buy products linked to Bitcoin prices without owning the coin itself. In May, the bank confirmed these securities would be allowed under its pilot. Now, major players like the Moscow Exchange are lining up to launch Bitcoin futures based on a new domestic index. High Trust In Russian Platforms Domestic exchanges are gaining the battle of trust. The poll indicates 78% of investors prefer Russian-registered platforms, and 85% would like to pay for their crypto accounts in rubles. Reliability is the number one aspect that counts (43%), followed by fees being low (24%) and simple deposits or withdrawals (24%). It seems many wealthy Russians feel safer sticking with local firms they know, rather than offshore sites. Investment Motives And Portfolio Mix Investors cite long‑term holdings as their top motive (57%), while 32% point to portfolio diversification and 25% to short‑term trading. About 33% of respondents currently allocate 5‑10% of their holdings to crypto‑related instruments. Reports show these figures show that for many, digital assets are no longer a fringe gamble but a regular slice of a broader investment strategy. Education Gaps And Market Worries Not all barriers have vanished. Many investors say they lack deep knowledge of blockchain technology, and they worry about wild price swings. High volatility and uncertainty remain the biggest deterrents for those who’ve held off. That suggests a clear need for better education, risk‑management tools, and perhaps simpler, regulated funds to ease newcomers in.

On-chain data suggests the bullish outlook was bolstered by rising demand from whales amid waning retail speculation. Technical analysis suggests the crypto market is not yet out of the woods but the bulls have the upper hand. Bitcoin (BTC) price rallied 2.5% in the past 24 hours to reach a new all-time high of slightly above $112k, before retracing to trade about $111,112 on Thursday, July 10, during the early European session. The wider altcoin market- led by Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE) – rallied in tandem. As a result, the total crypto market cap surged to $3.53 trillion, with the daily average trading volume having gained 40% to hover around $140 billion according to market data from Binance-backed Coinmarketcap. The sudden crypto pump in the past 24-hours resulted in more than $529 million liquidated from over 114,508 traders, with the shorts accounting for around $466 million. The move also pushed Bitcoin’s market capitalization above that of the tech giant Alphabet (Google).

2025-07-10T05:59:35,"Crypto Regulations in India 2025","The post Crypto Regulations in India 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News India’s cryptocurrency landscape in 2025 remains a mix of cautious regulation and rapid adoption. While cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are not recognized as legal tender, they operate in a regulatory grey area with evolving tax and compliance frameworks. Over 107 million Indians now engage with crypto assets. Below is a timeline of key crypto regulation updates in India during 2025, Table of contents Crypto Regulation India Timeline – 2025 Crypto Tax in India – 2025 (Fact-Checked) Crypto Adoption in India (2025 Snapshot) Conclusion FAQs Crypto Regulation India Timeline – 2025 June 2025 : Discussion paper on Cryptocurrency The Indian government planned to release a discussion paper to establish a regulatory framework for crypto in India. The initiative also promised to seek public consultation on– stakeholders, including financial institutions, legal experts, crypto companies, and the general public. May 22, 2025 : FSB Peer Review Preparation India gears up for the Financial Stability Board (FSB) review in October, aiming to align local crypto regulation with global regulatory standards. April 1, 2025 : SEBI Oversight Begins SEBI starts monitoring crypto tokens that resemble securities. A multi-agency regulatory model is proposed, including RBI, SEBI, and the Finance Ministry. February 13, 2025 : VDA Income Tax Amendment Bill Introduced The bill expands the scope of Virtual Digital Assets (VDAs) to include NFTs and undisclosed income. However, the 30% tax rate remains unchanged. February 10, 2025 : Crypto Exchanges Declared Reporting Entities Exchanges, wallets, and even mining pools are categorized as “reporting entities.” They must report all transactions to tax authorities under the new AML Crypto Tax in India – 2025 (Fact-Checked) As of now, no official reduction has been made to the 30% tax on crypto gains or the 1% TDS , despite industry demands. 1. For Investors and Traders Flat 30% Tax on gains from crypto sales, swaps, or gifts. No deductions allowed except for cost of acquisition. 1% TDS on transfers above ₹10,000 (buyer deducts and remits). No loss set-off or carry-forward permitted. Example: Buy BTC at ₹2.72 lakh → Sell at ₹8.72 lakh → ₹6 lakh profit → Tax = ₹1.8 lakh + TDS = ₹6,000 2. For Crypto Companies & Exchanges KYC/AML compliance is mandatory. 1% TDS to be collected and remitted on every qualifying user transaction. Transaction reporting to tax authorities under PMLA and IT laws. Category Tax Rate TDS Example Investors 30% 1% if >₹10k ₹50k profit → ₹15k tax + ₹500 TDS Traders 30% 1% if >₹10k Taxed as business income Companies NA 1% collected ₹10L transaction → ₹10k TDS Crypto Adoption in India (2025 Snapshot) Active Users : Over 107.3 million Indians (7.37% of population) hold or trade crypto. Revenue Forecast : India’s crypto market is projected to hit $6.4 billion by year-end. Exchanges : Platforms like CoinDCX, CoinSwitch, and Mudrex offer access to over 500 tokens. Growth Drivers : Rising financial inclusion, smartphone penetration, and blockchain innovation. Government Holdings : No official disclosure yet; policies prioritize transparency and user safety. Conclusion India’s crypto regulation in 2025 reflects a delicate balance between enabling innovation and enforcing oversight. With strict taxes (30% + 1% TDS) and real-time transaction reporting, the government is creating a compliant ecosystem without enforcing an outright ban. As the FSB review nears, clarity in crypto regulation India could open new doors for mass adoption and position the country at the forefront of the $7 trillion global digital economy. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-10T05:53:17,"Trump Jr. Buys Stake in Cash-Burning Social Media App Building Bitcoin Reserve","Donald Trump Jr. has snapped up 350,000 shares in Thumzup Media Corp., a struggling Los Angeles-based social media startup that is stockpiling Bitcoin despite reporting just $151 in revenue last quarter. The stake, disclosed in a Wednesday filing , was worth more than $4m at the previous close of $12.36 per share. Trump Jr. reportedly made the investment on his adviser’s recommendation and holds no further involvement with the company, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. The filing followed a $6m private placement of convertible preferred stock arranged by Dominari Securities. Both Trump Jr. and his brother Eric serve as advisors to the parent of that firm. Image Source: Thumzup Media SEC filing Thumzup Leans Into Crypto, Trump’s Family Doubles Down Thumzup offers an app that pays users for product recommendations on Instagram. It recorded a $2.2m loss on just $151 in revenue in Q1. Still, its stock soared almost 75% over the prior four sessions before tumbling 17% by mid‑Wednesday. In January, Thumzup made a notable pivot by announcing it would hold most of its liquid assets in Bitcoin. Since then, it has accumulated over $2m worth of the crypto asset. Now, the company plans to diversify further by adding six more coins, using funds raised in its latest round. The purchase deepens the Trump family’s involvement in crypto treasury strategies. Trump-linked entities have embraced Bitcoin hoarding across ventures, ranging from Dominari’s ETF investments, Metaplanet advisory board roles, to Trump Media & Technology Group’s $2.3b Bitcoin deployment. Trump Bets Big on Crypto, Raising Eyebrows Over Conflicts and Controversy Donald Trump has shifted from crypto skeptic to advocate, promoting policies to make the US the “crypto capital of the world.” His investments, including World Liberty Financial , the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins and NFT deals, have reportedly generated nearly $1b in revenue . These intertwined ventures have drawn scrutiny over potential conflicts, insider governance, and ties to controversial investors. Yet they continue to benefit from a rising regulatory tide and the Trump administration’s pro‑crypto posture.

2025-07-10T05:30:00,"Trump Jr Invests Millions in Bitcoin Treasury Company","Thumzup began accumulating BTC in late 2024 and now holds over $2.1 million worth. This trend mirrors the overall corporate shift towards Bitcoin reserves, which was popularized by Michael Saylor’s Strategy. Meanwhile, Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao is backing a new venture—BNB Treasury Company—aiming to give institutional investors exposure to BNB via a US-listed vehicle. Remixpoint, a Tokyo-based fintech and energy firm, is also making headlines after raising $215 million to triple its Bitcoin holdings to 3,000 BTC, with its CEO now also taking his salary in Bitcoin. Trump Jr Buys Into BTC Focused Media Company Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of US President Donald Trump, revealed an investment in Thumzup Media Corp, a social media marketing firm that adopted a Bitcoin-centric treasury strategy. According to Bloomberg, Trump Jr. owns 350,000 shares of the company, which is currently worth nearly $3.3 million based on a trading price of about $9.50 per share. Thumzup Media Corp share price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google Finance ) Thumzup’s embrace of Bitcoin began in November of 2024 when its board authorized the purchase of up to $1 million in BTC as part of its corporate treasury. CEO Robert Steele explained that the move was driven by the rise of Bitcoin ETFs and increased institutional support. Bitcoin's scarcity and inflation-resistant properties were also valuable traits that were considered for safeguarding company capital. Thumzup’s BTC holdings over time (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) To expand its position even more, Thumzup filed a universal shelf registration with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in May, to raise $200 million through debt and equity financing. As of now, the company holds 19.11 BTC, currently valued at over $2.1 million. The trend of companies like Thumzup adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset led to a wider discussion on the long-term viability of this strategy. Since 2024, there has been a surge in firms adding Bitcoin to their treasuries, with 258 institutions now listed on BitcoinTreasuries, ranging from public and private companies to crypto-native custodians and even government-linked entities. The movement was originally popularized by Michael Saylor, the co-founder of Strategy, who pivoted his business intelligence firm into a Bitcoin-focused treasury company back in 2020. Despite the growing list of adopters, some analysts are still skeptical about the sustainability of the trend. Critics argue that many of these newer entrants lack the strong conviction that is necessary to endure the extreme volatility of the crypto market. Bitcoin maximalist Max Keiser explained that Saylor and his company have already proven their resilience through multiple market downturns, unlike the recent wave of companies whose conviction has yet to be tested. A June report from venture capital firm Breed shared very similar concerns, and warned that most Bitcoin treasury companies could fail during the next bearish cycle. This could trigger a potential cascade of selloffs that may deepen any future downturn. CZ Backs New BNB Treasury Firm Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao’s family office is also backing a new investment venture that aims to give institutional and retail investors exposure to BNB through a publicly listed company in the United States. YZi Labs announced that it will support 10X Capital in launching the “BNB Treasury Company,” which plans to list on a major US exchange. The new firm will be led by David Namdar, a senior partner at 10X Capital and co-founder of Galaxy Digital, and 10X Capital will act as the company’s asset manager. This initiative is also part of the trend among firms aiming to create public vehicles for cryptocurrency exposure. BNB is the native token of the Binance ecosystem, and was originally created to provide trading discounts. It now powers applications across the BNB Chain, a blockchain that was launched by Binance in 2019. Ella Zhang, head of YZi Labs, stated that expanding institutional access to BNB could provide many meaningful benefits to the broader public. 10X Capital founder Hans Thomas stated that although BNB is one of the largest and most active ecosystems globally, US investors have had limited access to its growth. The BNB Treasury Company expects to announce the closure of its financing round in the coming weeks. Exchange-tied tokens like BNB serve as both user incentives and funding mechanisms for crypto platforms. While Binance created BNB and its blockchain, the company claims not to be directly involved in their ongoing development. However, Zhao revealed in February that nearly all of his crypto holdings—98.5%—are in BNB. According to Forbes , Zhao controls approximately 94 million BNB tokens, which equates to over 64% of its circulating supply. Binance controls an additional 31.5%. Combined, Zhao and Binance reportedly control close to 96% of all circulating BNB , currently worth around $63 billion. Despite being barred from managing Binance as part of a money laundering settlement with US authorities, Zhao is still the company’s largest shareholder. On Wednesday, he posted on X that more than 30 teams are interested in launching similar BNB-focused public treasury firms. While Bitcoin is the primary focus of most corporate crypto treasuries, BNB is beginning to attract institutional attention. Nasdaq-listed Nano Labs recently announced plans to purchase up to $1 billion worth of BNB, having already acquired $50 million. Remixpoint Plans to Triple Bitcoin Holdings Meanwhile, Tokyo-based energy and fintech firm Remixpoint announced that it raised 31.5 billion yen, or approximately $215 million, to expand its Bitcoin treasury reserves. The company revealed on X that the entire sum will be used for purchasing Bitcoin, which will help in its aggressive push into digital asset accumulation. The capital was secured through its 25th series of stock acquisition rights and the fourth series of unsecured bonds, which will result in the issuance of 55 million new shares—equivalent to a 39.9% dilution. The shares will be issued at market price without any discount. Remixpoint announcement on X Remixpoint stated that it plans to grow its Bitcoin holdings to 3,000 BTC in the short term. The company currently holds 1,051 BTC, worth over $113.8 million, placing it as the 30th largest Bitcoin-holding corporation according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET . This move happened on the heels of an announcement that CEO Takashi Tashiro will begin receiving his salary in Bitcoin to align his interests with shareholders and reflect the firm’s deepening belief in Bitcoin’s future potential. The board unanimously approved the strategic allocation, due to Bitcoin’s potential to enhance corporate value while balancing risk and flexibility. The company stressed that this decision was only made after very rigorous internal debate and is aimed at seizing long-term opportunity rather than taking reckless risks. Other Japanese companies are also ramping up their crypto holdings. Metaplanet recently purchased an additional 2,204 BTC for $237 million and is reportedly exploring the acquisition of a digital bank.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9876/trump-jr-invests-millions-in-bitcoin-treasury-company,"BTC|BNB|REGULATION|ZRX|EXCHANGE","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-07-10T05:01:54,"Bitcoin Bulls Increase Exposure as Trump's Pressure on Fed Pushes $15B Into BTC ETFs, Analyst Says","The U.S.-listed spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have attracted billions in investor capital in three months, amid increasing political pressure on the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) to cut rates. The relentless flows are now forcing ""under-positioned"" traders to chase upside through derivatives, reviving the bullish momentum in the cryptocurrency, according to Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research . ""The sharp surge in bitcoin ETF inflows since late April 2025 has been primarily driven by political pressure on the Federal Reserve, with Donald Trump openly demanding that Chair Jerome Powell cut rates to 1% and resign. What began as a partisan push has since broadened, with Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte and Senator Cynthia Lummis also calling for Powell to step down, criticizing his perceived hawkish stance,"" Thielen said in a note to clients Thursday. Trump's repeated attacks on the Federal Reserve have revived memories of Turkish President Erdogan's similar actions between 2019 and 2021, which led to a broad-based shift away from Turkish assets and a crash in the Lira. Back then, Erdogan issued multiple decrees dismissing central bank officials for not cutting rates. Meanwhile, Trump has repeatedly called for Powell's resignation, saying his reluctance to cut rates is costing America billions of dollars. The minutes of the Fed meeting held on July 17-18 showed a growing divide over how policy should proceed from here. According to CNBC, Opinions ranged from a ""couple"" of officials who said the next cut could come as soon as this month to ""some"" who thought no reductions this year would be appropriate. Under-positioned bulls re-enter The relentless ETF flows, combined with growing pressure on the Fed to cut rates, are finally forcing traders, who have been hesitant to commit to bullish trades, to re-enter the market fully. ""Since mid-April, Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated $15 billion worth of Bitcoin, and notably, this buying has continued uninterrupted, even as Bitcoin has consolidated since mid-May. This steady demand now appears to be forcing underpositioned traders back into the market, as suggested by positioning data from the derivatives space,"" Thielen said. Traders have been chasing call options at strikes $130,000, as CoinDesk noted early this week. A call option represents a bullish bet on the market, with the demand for the $ 130,000 call reflecting expectations for a price surge above that level. These bullish flows are consistent with the positive seasonality typically observed in July. Data tracked by Coinglass shows BTC has put in a positive performance in July in eight out of the past 12 years, with an average gain of over 7%. ""Combined with historically strong seasonality in July and potential bullish catalysts from upcoming macro data and policy developments, the backdrop remains supportive for further upside,"" Thielen noted. Bitcoin hit a record high of nearly $112,000 on some exchanges late Wednesday, according to data source CoinDesk.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/10/bitcoin-bulls-increase-exposure-as-trump-s-pressure-on-fed-pushes-usd15b-into-btc-etfs-analyst-says,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|FIAT|ZRX","Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Bitcoin ETF|News",cryptocompare
2025-07-10T05:00:25,"Is Bitcoin Ready to Pop? Analyst Warns of Sell-Side Liquidity Squeeze as Whales Take Over","Bitcoin continues to hover just below its previous all-time high, consolidating around the $109,000 mark despite a modest 1.9% gain over the past day. The asset reached a 7-day high of $110,307 but has yet to reclaim the historic high of $111,814, a level set back in May. While short-term price action remains within a tight range, on-chain data reveals deeper structural developments that could shape Bitcoin’s trajectory in the weeks ahead. As attention focuses on Bitcoin’s potential for a breakout, some analysts are turning to supply dynamics for clues. One notable observation comes from CryptoQuant contributor Chairman Lee, who has identified a significant reduction in BTC held on centralized exchanges. This trend may serve as a key indicator of future price behavior, especially in the context of institutional demand and exchange activity. Related Reading: Last Time This Happened, Bitcoin Jumped $50,000—Is History Repeating? Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Drop to Multi-Year Lows Chairman Lee’s analysis highlights a continued decline in exchange-held Bitcoin, with reserves falling to a multi-year low of 2.4 million BTC. This figure is down from over 3.1 million BTC reported in mid-2023. The consistent drawdown in exchange balances is interpreted as a signal that selling pressure is decreasing, which historically has preceded price expansions. According to Lee, “This persistent decline in reserve levels suggests that sell-side liquidity is drying up… Historically, such conditions—where BTC held on exchanges is low—precede major bullish expansions as demand exceeds supply.” In past market cycles, including the 2020–2021 bull run, similar drops in exchange reserves were followed by sharp upward movements in Bitcoin’s price. The logic is based on basic supply-demand mechanics: when available BTC becomes scarce on exchanges, any increase in demand, particularly from ETFs or institutional buyers, can lead to accelerated price growth. Lee emphasizes that this current trend could act as a foundational tailwind, potentially supporting further gains if current demand patterns remain in place. Binance Dominates Whale Transaction Flows Another piece of the market structure puzzle comes from CryptoQuant analyst Crazzyblockk, who examined large-scale BTC transactions across major centralized exchanges. According to his report, Binance has maintained its position as the dominant venue for Bitcoin whale activity. Whale flows are defined in this context as daily inflows or outflows exceeding 1,000 BTC. Binance has recorded cumulative whale inflows of 31.36 million BTC and outflows of 30.82 million BTC, along with 53.2 million whale transactions, significantly more than any other exchange. Notably, these numbers do not reflect unique BTC, but rather total flow volumes that include repeated movements of the same coins. High transaction volumes suggest Binance is favored for its liquidity and infrastructure, allowing whales to engage in trading, custody shifts, and arbitrage with minimal friction.

The data also places HTX Global and Kraken in the second and third positions, respectively, for whale inflows, though their volumes are substantially lower than Binance’s.

Set to launch at $0.06, buyers now lock in a guaranteed 100% return. Here’s why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ranks among the best crypto to buy today. Mutuum Finance price prediction: echoes of Bitcoin’s 2020-2021 surge Analysts are buzzing about Mutuum Finance (MUTM) hitting $3 in 2025. Starting at $0.03 now, that’s a jaw-dropping 10,000% leap, or 100x for early buyers. This isn’t wild guessing; it’s grounded in the project’s sturdy DeFi roots. Look back at Bitcoin’s run from 2020 to 2021 for context. Bitcoin dipped to $2,900 in March 2020, then rocketed to $69,000 by November 2021. That’s a 1590% ROI in just 14 months. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could follow a similar arc, fueled by its lending innovation and community hype. Buying now at $0.03 doubles your money at launch. Post-launch, a climb to $3 offers colossal gains. This potential makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a top pick among the best crypto to buy now. Dual lending model fuels growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rolling out a game-changing dual lending system. It mixes Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) setups.

There is also a large number of positions that will get liquidated if ETH returns to $2,800, observed Ted Pillows. He added that “Smart money is buying, and the Ethereum fractal looks like the Bitcoin 2020-21 cycle,” before stating that “The biggest move will happen in the coming months.” Analyst ‘Merlijn The Trader’ compared the Ethereum chart to the Dollar Index (DXY), saying. “It’s 2020 vibes but now with trillions in play.” Ethereum and the Dollar Index are dancing again.

Bitcoin hovered near its all-time high at $112,000, while Ether surged past $2,780, up nearly 7% over 24 hours. Dogecoin jumped 6%, with broader majors like Solana and XRP also gaining. The CoinDesk 20, a liquid index tracking the largest tokens by market capitalization, minus stablecoins, rose over 2%. Onchain analysis firm Santiment noted that retail trader-based wallets were seemingly absent from the current move, which, historically, sets the stage for sharp upside moves. “History has shown that this is a prime sign of a potential breakout, as crypto markets typically move the opposite direction of the crowd's expectations,” the firm said in an X post. “When retail shows FUD (whether through fear or impatience), these are usually prime spots for smart money to move in and accumulate. This time has been no different.” The moves came as U.S. equity markets digested another round of tariff threats from President Donald Trump, including a 50% levy on copper imports and higher duties on Brazilian goods that sent stocks in the country tumbling. However, U.S. equity-index futures dipped just 0.1% and global tech stocks continued to rally, with Nvidia briefly touching a $4 trillion market cap . Treasury yields softened as bond markets received a bid, suggesting that investors remain positioned for a supportive policy environment, even amid rising geopolitical noise.

Earlier today, Bitcoin briefly touched $112,150, crossing its old all-time high by a small margin. Though the price has slightly pulled back to around $111,400, analysts say this move shows strong bullish momentum in the market. Despite fears of market crashes, wars, and negative news, data from charts, on-chain activity, and macroeconomic trends have pointed to a continued uptrend. Many have been expecting this breakout for months and Bitcoin’s next major target could be around $120,000. At the time of writing, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization has climbed to $3.47 trillion, marking a 3.03% increase over the past 24 hours. Ethereum has also slipped in green, trading at $2,786, gaining over 7% in a day. XRP, Solana, and Cardano are showing upward momentum, with XRP up 5%, Solana rising 4%, and Cardano climbing 6.25% in the same period. What’s Next For Bitcoin Price? Bitcoin’s price is currently hovering close to a key resistance zone, awaiting a breakout above the $111,000–$112,000 level. If the price manages to break and hold above this range, it could trigger a new bullish price target around $111,500, with short-term resistance sitting slightly higher at $112,000. On the other side, if Bitcoin fails to break out, it faces support around $107,500, with a deeper support zone near $105,500. At the moment, price action remains mostly sideways on shorter timeframes, forming a symmetrical triangle pattern. However, large amounts of liquidity are building just above and below Bitcoin’s current price, raising the possibility of sudden price moves or fake-outs in the short term. Overall, while momentum is still lacking on higher time frames, the market is on edge waiting for Bitcoin’s next decisive move.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-ethereum-and-xrp-breakout-why-is-crypto-market-going-up-today/,"TRADING|BTC|MARKET|ADA|SOL","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis",cryptocompare
2025-07-10T03:22:11,"Coinbase, Robinhood, and the Race to Put Stocks on the Blockchain","Source: Medium When Bitcoin smashed through $100,000 in December 2024, it wasn’t just another price milestone; it was the culmination of something much bigger. The January 2024 SEC approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs had fundamentally rewired how institutional money flows into crypto, and we were watching the payoff in real time. Here’s what struck me about this moment: after years of regulatory resistance, the approval didn’t just legitimize Bitcoin; it created an entirely new infrastructure layer that traditional finance could finally plug into. The result? Bitcoin went from digital curiosity to portfolio necessity faster than anyone anticipated. The infrastructure shift is where things get interesting. These aren’t your typical investment products. Spot Bitcoin ETFs hold actual Bitcoin, not contracts or derivatives. Think of it like a gold ETF that stores physical bullion, except the “vault” is digital and the custodians are crypto-native companies that suddenly found themselves managing institutional billions. Nine of the twelve currently trading spot Bitcoin ETFs rely on Coinbase for custody. Coinbase’s custody of 9 out of 12 Bitcoin ETFs creates both competitive advantage and concentration risk. This infrastructure dominance generates stable revenue but raises questions about single points of failure in the crypto ecosystem. That’s not an accident; it’s the market recognizing that crypto infrastructure requires crypto expertise. Traditional banks talking about “blockchain solutions” for years suddenly needed companies that actually knew how to secure digital assets at institutional scale. This concentration creates fascinating dynamics. Coinbase transformed from a platform dependent on trading fees (feast during bull markets, famine during crypto winters) into critical financial infrastructure. ETF custody generates predictable revenue regardless of market sentiment. It’s the difference between being a casino and being the bank that handles the casino’s money. The numbers tell the story. Coinbase posted record results through 2024, positioning itself for what analysts expect will be a massive 2025. The company evolved from riding crypto waves to becoming the infrastructure that institutional waves crash against. But infrastructure plays attract competition, and Robinhood has been gaining ground with a different approach. While Coinbase focuses on institutional custody and compliance, Robinhood targets the retail investor frustrated with crypto complexity. The ETF revolution transformed revenue models for crypto platforms. Trading fees dropped from 70% to 35% of revenue while infrastructure services grew from 15% to 45%, creating more predictable business models less dependent on market volatility. Recent moves show this strategy in action: tokenized U.S. stocks across Europe, crypto staking for major cryptocurrencies, perpetual futures trading, and a custom blockchain for real-world asset settlement. Robinhood is building the on-ramp for mainstream adoption while Coinbase manages the vault. The platform’s commission-free crypto trading and streamlined experience have captured market share, particularly as regulatory clarity reduces friction. Record trading volumes and analyst optimism for 2025 suggest this retail-focused approach complements rather than competes with institutional infrastructure. Then there’s BTCS Inc., which offers a different lesson entirely. As the first cryptocurrency company on NASDAQ back in 2014, BTCS represents the pure-play approach to crypto business models. The company pioneered “Bividends” (paying shareholders in Bitcoin rather than cash) and operates blockchain analytics while maintaining direct crypto holdings. BTCS currently holds 90 Bitcoin and has expanded to 12,500 Ethereum through strategic financing. The company demonstrates how crypto-native businesses adapt to institutional validation without abandoning their foundational principles. While giants battle for infrastructure dominance, specialized players carve sustainable niches. Get Brendan on Blockchain’s stories in your inbox Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer.Subscribe What makes this entire ecosystem shift fascinating is how quickly traditional finance absorbed what was supposed to be disruptive technology. Spot Bitcoin ETFs solved the institutional access problem by providing compliant exposure through familiar investment vehicles. This flow diagram shows how different investor types can now access Bitcoin without direct crypto custody requirements. ETFs provided the compliant wrapper institutional investors needed, turning crypto from alternative asset to portfolio component. The regulatory environment signals this acceptance is permanent. Political leadership openly supporting crypto as strategic national infrastructure, combined with continued SEC evolution, suggests the framework will expand rather than contract. Ethereum ETFs, multi-crypto funds, and integration with traditional wealth management represent logical progressions. Institutional behavior confirms this maturation. Recent filings show mixed activity: some asset managers trimming Bitcoin ETF positions during Q1 2025 volatility while others made first-time allocations. This isn’t speculation; it’s portfolio management. Institutions treat crypto like any other asset class requiring risk assessment and allocation decisions. The infrastructure supporting this transformation continues solidifying. Custody solutions evolved from exchange wallets to institutional-grade security. Trading infrastructure handles billions in daily volume without the technical failures that plagued early crypto markets. Regulatory frameworks provide clarity for compliance officers nervous about digital assets. Market structure reflects this evolution. Price discovery happens across regulated exchanges with institutional participation rather than fragmented crypto-only platforms. Liquidity comes from diverse sources including algorithmic trading, institutional arbitrage, and retail participation through familiar brokerages. But here’s what I find most compelling: we’re witnessing the creation of parallel financial infrastructure rather than replacement of existing systems. Crypto didn’t disrupt traditional finance; it forced traditional finance to build crypto-compatible systems. Coinbase became the bridge between Bitcoin networks and institutional custody requirements. Robinhood built crypto trading that feels like stock trading. ETF providers wrapped crypto exposure in familiar investment vehicles. Each player solved specific friction points rather than demanding wholesale adoption of new paradigms. This infrastructure approach explains why Bitcoin ETF approval catalyzed such dramatic price movements. Bitcoin’s price acceleration correlates directly with ETF infrastructure milestones rather than speculative bubbles. The correlation between regulatory developments, ETF volume, and sustained price growth demonstrates institutional demand driving the market. Institutional money wasn’t waiting for crypto to mature; it was waiting for compliant access methods. Once those existed, allocation decisions followed standard portfolio logic rather than speculation. The winners in this transformation aren’t necessarily the platforms with the most users or the highest trading volumes. They’re the companies providing reliable infrastructure for an asset class that institutional investors can no longer ignore. Success metrics have shifted accordingly. Revenue stability matters more than growth rates. Regulatory compliance generates competitive advantages. Technical reliability determines institutional trust. These factors favor established players with resources to build proper infrastructure over startups promising disruption. Looking forward, the infrastructure is set. Regulatory frameworks continue evolving supportively. Institutional adoption follows predictable patterns based on risk tolerance and allocation models. The speculation phase is ending; the infrastructure utilization phase is beginning. The revolution isn’t in Bitcoin’s price reaching six figures. It’s in the infrastructure making crypto a standard component of diversified portfolios. The companies that built this infrastructure (and continue maintaining it) control the future of institutional crypto adoption. That’s where the real value gets created and captured.

Bitcoin (BTC) surged past $111,000, ether (ETH) jumped nearly 7% to above $2,700, and Solana’s SOL climbed above $158, catching traders betting against the move completely offside. More than 114,000 traders were liquidated, with combined losses topping $527 million, according to data from Coinglass. Of that, $463 million came from short positions — or leveraged bets that the market would go lower — while only $64 million came from longs. The single largest liquidation was a $51.5 million short on HTX’s BTC-USDT pair. Liquidations occur when traders using leverage, or borrowing funds to amplify their positions, are unable to meet margin requirements as prices move against them. Exchanges forcibly close these positions to prevent further losses, often adding fuel to the move itself. In this case, as BTC and ETH pushed higher, waves of short liquidations may have created sudden price acceleration, forcing more traders to exit in a cascade. This reflexive dynamic makes liquidation data a useful trading signal. Sharp spikes in liquidations, especially from one side of the book, often indicate local tops or bottoms, depending on direction and timing. Some traders even position around it, betting on short squeezes or long flush-outs when the numbers start to skew. When combined with volume and price action, liquidation events often confirm the strength of a trend or signal its exhaustion. While Bitcoin remains up just 2% on the week, ETH and XRP are now both up more than 7%, suggesting the rally is being led by majors outside of BTC.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/10/bears-lose-400m-to-liquidations-largest-since-may-as-btc-eth-sol-spike-higher,"BTC|ETH|SOL|TRADING|MARKET","Markets|News",cryptocompare

All funds are allocated for the acquisition of Bitcoin. The company aims to hold 3,000 BTC in the near term. However, it warned that fluctuations in the crypto asset’s prices and its own stock price could affect the plan. Remixpoint Bets Big on Bitcoin Following the initial acquisition, additional purchases will be based on the average stock price over three consecutive trading days. In its disclosure, Remixpoint stated that after extensive internal discussions, it has become increasingly convinced of Bitcoin’s future potential. Although various opinions were expressed within the company, the board unanimously concluded that the move would boost corporate value from a risk-return perspective while expanding future strategic options. “We understand the difference between seizing opportunities and playing it safe, as well as the distinction between a challenge and recklessness. We kindly ask for your continued warm support.” The latest development comes just a day after the Japanese energy firm said that it will pay its President and CEO, Yoshihiko Takahashi, his entire executive compensation in Bitcoin. Following the move, it became the first listed company in the country to adopt this approach. The step is in line with Remixpoint’s goal of “shareholder-oriented management,” ensuring that management shares the same economic fate as shareholders, especially as its share price often moves in tandem with Bitcoin’s price. The decision follows shareholder feedback urging management to align more closely with investor interests. While insider trading restrictions make it difficult for executives to acquire company shares, paying the CEO in Bitcoin offers a practical alternative to share economic value with shareholders while supporting Remixpoint’s strategy of integrating crypto assets, energy, and Web initiatives. The announcement comes amid a broader trend in Japan of companies, including Gumi, Value Creation, Metaplanet, and SBC Medical, adding Bitcoin to their strategies and balance sheets. Semler’s Corporate Bitcoin Accumulation Race Outside Japan, corporate adoption of Bitcoin as a treasury asset continues to gain momentum. For instance, Nasdaq-listed healthcare tech firm Semler Scientific acquired 187 BTC for $20 million at $106,906 per bitcoin this week. The purchase was funded using proceeds from its at-the-market (ATM) stock program. With this latest addition, Semler now holds a total of 4,636 BTC. The stash is currently valued at around $502 million, against a total purchase cost of $430 million. This implies paper gains of approximately $72 million and places the company 15th among corporations with the largest BTC holdings.

2025-07-10T00:05:02,"RBA advances wholesale CBDC trials with industry partners","<p>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) announced on Thursday a significant step forward in developing a wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC), launching “Project Acacia” in collaboration with industry partners. The initiative will test 19 pilot programs using real money and assets for the first time, alongside five proof-of-concept trials involving simulated transactions.</p><p>The trials span various asset classes, including fixed income, private markets, trade receivables, and carbon credits. Settlement methods will explore CBDCs, stablecoins, bank deposit tokens, and innovative applications of existing commercial bank deposits held at the RBA. Testing will occur over the next six months using platforms such as Hedera, Redbelly, R3 Corda, and Canvas Connect, with a final report expected in the first half of 2026.</p><p>RBA Assistant Governor Brad Jones said the selected use cases will help assess how both central bank and private digital money, alongside payments infrastructure, could enhance Australia's wholesale financial markets. The RBA remains focused on wholesale applications, having found limited economic justification for a retail digital currency. Expected benefits include lower risks, improved transparency, better collateral efficiency, and cost reductions.</p>
