2025-07-10T18:45:53,"$3,000 Cap on International Transfers Hitting New Zealand Amid Anti-Money Laundering Efforts","New Zealand is preparing to impose new limits on international cash transfers in a bid to strengthen efforts to combat serious financial crimes. Associate Justice Minister Nicole McKee says the government is taking further steps to overhaul the nation’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CFT) regime. The objective is to prevent criminal misuse of the financial system while bringing more clarity and consistency for businesses. “Cabinet has agreed to introduce a bill to strengthen enforcement powers for police and regulators to crack down on those involved in money laundering. It will also establish a new financial sanctions supervisory regime and initiate engagement on a sustainable levy to fund AML/CFT system improvements.” The government wants to place a cap of 5,000 NZD, or $3,000, on international money transfers. The plan also involves preventing criminals from tapping into crypto to move the proceeds of their illicit activities. “An upper limit will be set on how much cash can be transferred internationally ($5,000 per transfer), reducing the ability of the criminal organization to move its funds offshore. We will also make it more difficult for criminals to convert cash to high-risk assets such as cryptocurrencies by banning crypto ATMs.” The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) will likewise be authorized to order banks and other businesses subject to the AML/CFT Act to provide relevant information on persons of interest. “Since 2019, the global financial and regulatory landscape has shifted significantly. We need a smarter, more agile AML/CFT system – one that targets criminals’ ability to launder money, while enabling New Zealand businesses to operate efficiently and competitively.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-10T18:41:24,"SEC Commissioner Peirce Declares Tokenized Securities Under the Purview of the Regulator","Commissioner Hester M. Peirce of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has clarified the regulator’s stance on tokenized securities in a new statement. According to an official SEC statement released by Peirce, the burgeoning sector of tokenized securities falls under the regulator’s shadow. “As powerful as blockchain technology is, it does not have magical abilities to transform the nature of the underlying asset. Tokenized securities are still securities. Accordingly, market participants must consider—and adhere to—the federal securities laws when transacting in these instruments.” Peirce says that firms distributing tokenized securities must still consider their disclosure obligations to the SEC under federal law and ensure their practices are aligned with the law in order to avoid potential penalties. Peirce also says that purchasers of said tokenized securities should also consider the implications of securities laws when reporting their holdings. Furthermore, the SEC commissioner says the regulator is open to working with the market to optimize regulations. “Market participants, as they structure their tokenization product offerings, should consider meeting with the Commission and its staff. When unique aspects of a technology warrant changes to existing rules or where regulatory requirements are outdated or unnecessary, we stand ready to work with market participants to craft appropriate exemptions and modernize rules.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-10T18:31:26,"Urgent ESMA MiCA Scrutiny Unveils Alarming Malta Crypto Authorization Concerns","The world of cryptocurrency is dynamic, constantly evolving not just in terms of technology and market prices, but also in its regulatory landscape. As the industry matures, so does the scrutiny from global financial watchdogs. A recent development has sent ripples through the European crypto space, highlighting the critical importance of compliance and thoroughness in licensing processes. The spotlight is now firmly on Malta, as the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) initiates a comprehensive review of its adherence to the landmark Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations. What Sparked the Urgent ESMA MiCA Scrutiny? The core of the matter revolves around the authorization of a specific crypto asset service provider (CASP) in Malta. ESMA, the European Union’s financial markets regulator, has expressed significant concerns regarding a ‘fast-tracked’ authorization process. According to reports from CoinDesk, this authorization was allegedly granted despite a notable lack of thoroughness and the presence of unresolved issues. This raises an urgent question about the integrity of the regulatory procedures in place. The Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation is designed to create a harmonized legal framework for crypto assets across the EU, aiming to protect investors, ensure market integrity, and foster innovation responsibly. ESMA’s intervention underscores its commitment to upholding these standards, ensuring that national authorities are diligently applying the new rules. This ESMA MiCA scrutiny is a clear signal that laxity in compliance will not be tolerated. Malta Crypto Regulations Under the Microscope: A Reputational Challenge? Malta has historically positioned itself as a ‘Blockchain Island,’ aiming to be a pioneer in crypto regulation. Its early adoption of frameworks for virtual financial assets (VFAs) attracted numerous crypto businesses. However, this recent development places Malta’s regulatory prowess and the effectiveness of its national financial watchdog, the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA), directly under the microscope. ESMA’s concerns about the ‘lack of thoroughness’ in the authorization process imply that the MFSA may have issued a license without ensuring necessary remediation or fully addressing all outstanding issues. This could significantly impact the perception of Malta crypto regulations on the international stage, potentially eroding trust among prospective businesses and investors who seek robust and reliable regulatory environments. Key Concerns Regarding Malta’s Regulatory Process: Fast-tracked Authorization: Allegations of licenses being issued too quickly without adequate due diligence. Unresolved Issues: Indications that pre-existing problems or compliance gaps were not fully addressed before authorization. Lack of Thoroughness: A broader concern about the depth and rigor of the MFSA’s review process for CASP applications. Reputational Risk: The potential for Malta’s standing as a reputable crypto hub to be diminished. The Enigma of OKX Authorization: A Case Study in Due Diligence? While not officially confirmed by ESMA or the MFSA, OKX Exchange, a major global crypto platform, is widely suspected to be the entity in question. OKX received ‘pre-authorization’ in Malta earlier this year, making it a plausible candidate for the CASP under review. The specifics of OKX authorization in Malta, particularly the conditions of its pre-authorization, are now subject to intense speculation. This situation highlights the complexities of licensing large, international crypto exchanges. Regulators must balance the desire to attract innovation with the imperative to protect consumers and maintain financial stability. If a major player like OKX is involved in a case where due diligence was reportedly lacking, it sets a concerning precedent for the entire industry and underscores the need for transparent and rigorous licensing protocols. Navigating the Future: Implications for Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) This incident carries significant implications for all Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) operating or planning to operate within the European Union. MiCA is designed to standardize regulatory requirements across all 27 EU member states, ensuring a level playing field and preventing regulatory arbitrage. ESMA’s proactive stance in scrutinizing Malta’s compliance suggests that national regulators will be held to a high standard. CASPs, whether exchanges, custodians, or issuers of crypto assets, must understand that compliance is not merely a formality but a continuous commitment. This event could lead to: Stricter Scrutiny: Other EU member states might adopt even more cautious and thorough approaches to MiCA implementation and CASP licensing. Enhanced Due Diligence: Regulators may demand more extensive documentation, more robust internal controls, and clearer remediation plans for any identified deficiencies. Increased Compliance Costs: CASPs will likely need to invest more in legal, compliance, and technological infrastructure to meet evolving regulatory expectations. Precedent Setting: The outcome of ESMA’s review of Malta could establish critical benchmarks for how MiCA is interpreted and enforced across the bloc. The MFSA Investigation: Upholding Regulatory Integrity For the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA), this investigation represents a critical moment. As the primary financial regulator in Malta, its credibility and effectiveness are now being evaluated by a higher European authority. The outcome of the MFSA investigation will determine not only the immediate actions required but also the long-term trust placed in Malta’s regulatory framework. The MFSA will likely need to demonstrate a clear action plan for addressing ESMA’s concerns, which could include reviewing past authorizations, implementing stricter internal procedures, and enhancing transparency. This situation highlights the delicate balance national regulators must strike between fostering innovation in emerging sectors like crypto and ensuring robust consumer protection and market integrity. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Industry: In light of these developments, crypto businesses and aspiring CASPs should consider the following: Proactive Engagement: Engage early and often with regulatory bodies to understand their expectations and address potential issues before they escalate. Robust Compliance Frameworks: Invest significantly in internal compliance teams, technologies, and processes that can adapt to evolving regulatory landscapes. Deep Understanding of MiCA: Ensure your legal and compliance teams have an exhaustive understanding of MiCA’s requirements and how they are being interpreted by national authorities. Transparency and Remediation: Be transparent about any past or current compliance issues and demonstrate clear, actionable plans for their remediation. Jurisdictional Due Diligence: Carefully assess the regulatory reputation and track record of any jurisdiction before committing to an authorization process. Conclusion: The Dawn of a New Regulatory Era The ESMA investigation into Malta’s MiCA compliance, particularly concerning the suspected OKX authorization, marks a significant moment in European crypto regulation. It unequivocally signals that the era of ‘regulation light’ or ‘fast-track’ approvals in the crypto space is rapidly drawing to a close. As MiCA comes into full effect, regulatory thoroughness and strict adherence to established protocols will become non-negotiable. This incident serves as a powerful reminder that while innovation is encouraged, it must always be balanced with robust oversight and unwavering commitment to investor protection and market integrity. The future of crypto in Europe will be defined by compliance, transparency, and a collaborative effort between innovative businesses and vigilant regulators.

2025-07-10T18:30:42,"The Hidden Clue In Bitcoin Hourly Close: A Breakout Brewing?","Bitcoin’s latest hourly close may be offering more than meets the eye. With the 25- and 50-hour SMAs holding firm and the MACD showing renewed expansion, some analysts believe a breakout could be quietly brewing, and smart traders are starting to take notice. BTC’s Momentum Builds With Healthy Technical Backing In his latest 1-hour market update, Shaco AI noted that Bitcoin continues to humor the bulls, printing a strong close at $111,225.5. The price action has maintained a clear bullish bias, staying well above both the 25-hour simple moving average (SMA) at $110,147 and the 50-hour SMA at $109,420. This positioning suggests that BTC is building a solid base for continuation, with short-term trend followers likely remaining confident in the move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Moving With Stocks, But Ethereum’s Correlation Is Fading Furthermore, the MACD has widened impressively, with a gain of $589.72, reflecting persistent buying pressure and bullish sentiment. As the MACD histogram expands and signal lines diverge, it reinforces the idea that the bulls may be far from done, and dips could be viewed as buying opportunities. Shaco AI also pointed to the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which now sits at 63.73. This level shows that the market is in a healthy bullish zone, strong enough to maintain upward momentum, but not yet in overbought territory that typically invites profit-taking or cooling off. Adding confidence to the trend, the Average Directional Index (ADX) has hit 38.93, which Shaco AI emphasized as a key confirmation that the current trend has strength and durability. With all key indicators pointing to continued bullish structure, supported by rising momentum, trend alignment, and strong directional force, Bitcoin’s short-term technical picture remains decisively positive. The bulls are in control, and the chart suggests they may not be done pushing just yet. Breakout Or Breakdown? Bitcoin Poised At A Technical Crossroads Shaco AI, in his final remarks, highlighted that Bitcoin is approaching critical territory, marking resistance at $111,999.79 and support at $108,096.55 as the key zones to watch. He urged traders to “watch these like a hawk!” as price action around these levels could be decisive in determining BTC’s next major move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Resumes Upward Move — Can It Break New Highs? He also pointed out that trading volume has been unusually quiet, joking that it “seems to have missed some coffee breaks,” with just 395 units recorded compared to the average of 869. This lighter volume signals reduced conviction, which could lead to sudden volatility or fakeouts near those key zones. “Keep those eyes peeled for potential breakouts or retracements as BTC flirts with key levels, but do remember there’s caution in the air with this lighter trading volume,” the expert added.

2025-07-10T18:11:11,"Ethereum Foundation unveils new strategy to accelerate ecosystem growth","The Ethereum Foundation (EF) has unveiled a new vision for its role in the blockchain’s evolution in a strategy update titled “The Future of Ecosystem Development at the EF.”The vision focuses on ecosystem acceleration, ecosystem amplification, ecosystem support, and long-term ecosystem unblocking. EF announced a new organizational structure, expanding its core teams around four pillars, including enterprise relations, developer growth, app relations & research, and founder success. Recently, big institutional investors, who used to be drawn to Bitcoin, are now turning more and more to Ethereum (ETH). This change isn’t just caused by the way the market works; it’s a big change in how institutions think about digital assets. In a blog, the Ethereum Foundation has said, “Interest in Ethereum has expanded beyond technologists and enthusiasts, bringing enterprises, governments, and everyday users who seek practical solutions and tangible benefits. The Ethereum ecosystem is adapting to meet these needs, and the Ethereum Foundation is ready to play its part.” The numbers tell the story. The network saw a huge rise of $9.7 billion in flows in just one month, with net flows reaching $1.3 billion in the last week alone. This huge increase shows institutional investors are very optimistic about Ethereum’s long-term growth prospects. Also, since transaction costs have dropped to about $0.10, companies are finding an ecosystem that is both cost-effective and encourages innovation on a scale that has never been seen before. A goal to maximize the direct and indirect users The foundation has highlighted two main goals. One is to maximize the number of people who directly or indirectly use Ethereum, in such a way that they benefit from Ethereum’s underlying values. To achieve this, the foundation plans to work with existing networks and community members to speed up EcoDev. According to them, Ethereum already has many users and organizations that help founders, developers, apps, businesses, and community events. These groups and individuals include L2s, accelerators, investors, instructors, and more. According to the foundation, “We want to help accelerate the pace of ecosystem growth by working closely with developers, founders, app teams, and enterprises who want to use Ethereum.” Companies like Sharplink Gaming and Bit Digital are at the forefront of migrating from Bitcoin to Ethereum. Recent disclosures have revealed that Sharplink Gaming boasts an impressive reserve of 198,167 ETH. This positions it as the world’s largest institutional ETH holder, just behind the Ethereum Foundation. Also, Bit Digital announced an ambitious fundraising target of $ 172 million and later purchased over 100,000 ETH. This underlined its strategic pivot toward Ethereum staking, drawing attention to Ethereum’s rising prominence. Maximize the resilience of Ethereum’s technical infrastructure. The second goal is to maximize the resilience of Ethereum’s technical and social infrastructure. This is a critical one. According to SlowMist , Ethereum led all ecosystems in security losses in the first half of 2025, with DeFi platforms losing around $470 million. The report revealed emerging risks were tied to Ethereum’s EIP-7702 wallet delegation feature. It was introduced as part of the Pectra upgrade earlier this year. The feature allows users to authorize smart contracts to act on their behalf without having to swap out their wallet address. According to SlowMist, the exploit used standard wallet tools to trick the user into approving token access in bulk, a type of risk that anti-phishing tools may not always detect. “Even if the contract itself has no backdoors, if you are tricked by a phishing site into granting authorization, attackers can exploit the contract’s full operational capabilities to drain your assets in bulk,” SlowMist said. In addition, the firm noted that other risks associated with EIP-7702 include potential private key leaks, replay attacks across multiple chains, and issues that could arise during wallet upgrades. In addition, EIP-7702 brings “new risk boundaries,” adding that users must fully understand who they are authorizing and what permissions they grant before signing any delegation.

The company acquired 90 BTC for approximately $10 million at an average price of $108,884 per coin, inclusive of fees and expenses. According to a post by CEO Michael Mo on July 9, 2025, KULR has achieved a year-to-date Bitcoin yield of 291%. The firm now holds a total of 1,021 BTC, acquired for around $101 million at an average cost of $98,627 per bitcoin. KULR confirmed that the latest acquisitions align with its Bitcoin Treasury Strategy, which was first introduced on December 4, 2024. Under this approach, the company allocates up to 90% of its surplus cash reserves to bitcoin. K Wave Media Inc. also announced a $1 billion financing package to advance its bitcoin acquisition strategy. The funding includes a newly signed $500 million convertible note agreement with Anson Funds and a previously disclosed $500 million standby equity purchase agreement with Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, the company stated in an announcement on Thursday. As part of the initiative, K Wave has already acquired 88 BTC and plans to issue $15 million in senior secured convertible notes and warrants in the first tranche. The company intends to allocate at least 80% of these proceeds toward additional bitcoin purchases. The financing arrangement allows for the potential issuance of up to $500 million in convertible notes and warrants, with the conversion price set at $4.40 per share. KULR and K Wave join a growing list of publicly traded firms incorporating bitcoin into their treasury strategies, following in the footsteps of companies like MicroStrategy, a major corporate holder of the cryptocurrency. As bitcoin adoption expands, BTC yield is emerging as a key performance indicator for companies with digital asset holdings.

2025-07-10T17:51:01,"Bitcoin (BTC) sets new ATH, over $600M short positions liquidated","Bitcoin (BTC) has once again surged past expectations, reaching a new all-time high (ATH) and sending shockwaves through the crypto market. Just a day after breaching the $112,000 mark for the first time, Bitcoin has extended its rally to hit a fresh peak of $113,317, according to CoinGecko data . Bitcoin price chart | Source: CoinGecko This historic move came after a prolonged period of sideways trading that kept BTC trapped between $105,000 and $110,000. The breakout was sparked by a renewed push from President Donald Trump for the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates. His remarks on Truth Social emphasised the strength of the markets and called for urgent monetary easing, saying that the Fed should “rapidly lower rates” and that there was “no inflation.” Traders quickly responded to the statement, viewing it as a signal that a looser monetary environment could be on the horizon. This anticipation triggered an immediate influx of capital into crypto markets, pushing Bitcoin out of its consolidation zone and into price discovery mode. As the price of Bitcoin soared, the broader crypto market followed suit . Ethereum (ETH) has gained nearly 5%, climbing above $2,800, while Dogecoin (DOGE) has spiked by more than 5.5%, reflecting the bullish sentiment across the board. Over half a billion dollars’ worth of Bitcoin short positions liquidated According to data from Coinglass , over $600 million in leveraged positions have been wiped out within 24 hours, marking one of the highest daily liquidation totals in recent weeks. The majority of these losses came from short sellers who were betting against the rally. In a particularly notable event, a single large position, widely believed to belong to a major institutional player, was liquidated for more than $51 million. According to CoinGlass data, more than $80 million in liquidations occurred within a single hour as Bitcoin’s rally gained steam. The liquidation pressure likely contributed to the swift momentum, as short positions were forcefully closed, creating additional upward buying pressure. Market analysts have pointed to a combination of technical and macroeconomic factors driving this breakout. Joe DiPasquale, CEO of BitBull Capital, noted that institutional demand, strong ETF inflows, and a general risk-on environment are helping push Bitcoin into uncharted territory. He explained that once Bitcoin crossed the key psychological resistance at $110,000, sidelined capital began to flow back into the market aggressively. On-chain data, according to DiPasquale, still shows room for further growth, although the market remains vulnerable to sudden corrections if sentiment shifts. While the Federal Reserve has been cautious about further interest rate cuts, pressure from the executive branch may influence its stance, especially as inflation has cooled and markets appear resilient. Investors are watching closely for any policy changes that could further validate this bullish narrative. In the meantime, Bitcoin’s new record high solidifies its dominance in the crypto landscape and reaffirms its role as a macro-sensitive asset.

The explosive move comes after President Trump declared on Truth Social that crypto is going “ through the roof ,” triggering massive buying pressure across digital asset markets. Trump’s social media post highlighted record highs across tech stocks, industrial stocks, and the NASDAQ, while specifically calling out cryptocurrency’s stellar performance. Source: Ash Crypto on X The president emphasized that NVIDIA has gained 47% since Trump tariffs were announced, while urging the Federal Reserve to “ rapidly lower rates ” to reflect the economy’s strength.

2025-07-10T17:03:40,"BIT Mining Makes Bold Shift Into Solana With $300M Bet","BIT Mining, a public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), has announced a significant shift in its business strategy. The company revealed it will now focus on the Solana blockchain and start buying the Solana native token (SOL). To support this move, it plans to raise between $200 million and $300 million. The decision is part of the company’s broader effort to grow its presence in the crypto industry and bring more value to its shareholders. BIT Mining to Fully Switch to SOL and Hodl for the Long Term BIT Mining is starting a new chapter as it shifts entirely to the Solana blockchain. Right now, it is the 17th biggest public Bitcoin mining company by market value. As part of this change, BIT Mining will turn all its current crypto into SOL. The company also plans to hold these tokens for a long time instead of selling them. This move aligns with a growing trend among public companies to hold digital assets on their balance sheets as a long-term investment. In addition to holding SOL, BIT Mining will take on a technical role in the Solana ecosystem. It plans to operate validator nodes, which are essential for keeping the network decentralized and secure. By doing so, the company expects to earn rewards directly on the blockchain through Solana’s staking system. Strong Belief in Solana Blockchain’s Future BIT Mining’s leaders say this new path is needed in the fast-changing crypto world. They believe their skills in hardware and mining make them ready to help the Solana network and grow their business. The company hopes this shift will bring faster innovation, improved blockchain connections, and greater value for its investors. Currently, the firm focuses on self-mining, developing mining machines, and providing hosting services. It also uses advanced chips to mine coins like Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Ethereum Classic. Meanwhile, BIT Mining is not the only company embracing other crypto assets beyond Bitcoin. Other mining firms, including BitMine and Bit Digital, are also adopting assets like Ethereum . BIT Mining Begins A Fresh Start After Legal Challenges BIT Mining’s new focus comes after the company settled a legal case with U.S. regulators . In November, it agreed to pay a $10 million penalty to resolve investigations related to its former business under the name 500.com. The case involved alleged bribes to Japanese government officials. At the time, the company was based in Shenzhen, China, and operated an online sports lottery platform. Since then, the company has transformed its focus. In April 2021, it rebranded from 500.com to BIT Mining and began trading under the ticker BTCM. This latest move into the Solana ecosystem is seen as another step in the company’s effort to redefine its mission and build a stronger position in the blockchain industry.

Many altcoins have produced notable gains over the past 24 hours as well, with ETH climbing above $2,800 and DOGE shooting up by over 5.5%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView BTC was stuck in a consolidation phase for weeks, with a lower boundary at $105,000 and an upper one at $110,000.

This time, the $110,000 barrier couldn’t contain bitcoin, and the asset blasted through it with ease yesterday, popping up to a new all-time high at $112,000 amid growing demand from US investors. It retraced slightly today, but the bulls went back on the offensive hours ago, pushing the cryptocurrency to a new peak of over $113,000. With many altcoins posting impressive price increases over the past 24 hours, it’s no wonder that the overall liquidations within that timeframe have marked a multi-week high of $600 million.

2025-07-10T17:00:29,"Warren Advocates For Stronger Oversight In Crypto Markets With New Proposal","Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren is reportedly set to unveil her proposed framework for regulating the cryptocurrency market, adding to the growing divide between the approaches of the Democratic and Republican parties to digital asset legislation. Warren Critiques Republican Crypto Principles As the leading Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, Warren has consistently expressed her concerns regarding the crypto industry, and her forthcoming principles aim to establish a regulatory environment that protects consumers and the traditional financial system. In her opening remarks at a scheduled hearing, Warren plans to criticize the principles recently proposed by her Republican colleagues, which she believes cater excessively to the crypto lobby. She will assert that these proposals could undermine existing securities laws and create loopholes that allow market turmoil to affect conventional financial institutions. “I’m concerned that what my Republican colleagues are aiming for is another industry handout,” Warren intends to say. According to a recent report by The Hill, Warren’s crypto framework advocates for the application of established protections and anti-money laundering regulations to the digital asset sector. The crypto-skeptic Senator will also demand measures to counteract potential corruption linked to presidential involvement in cryptocurrency ventures. “If we’re going to provide rules of the road for crypto, we need to shut down this superhighway for presidential corruption at the same time,” she plans to declare. Modernized Digital Asset Rules Warren’s approach stands in stark contrast to the principles laid out by Senate Banking Chair Tim Scott and his Republican colleagues, including Senators Cynthia Lummis, Thom Tillis, and Bill Hagerty, who have focused on fostering innovation within the crypto space. Their proposals, announced in late June, call for modernizing regulations to promote innovation while ensuring that measures against illicit finance remain effective yet not overly burdensome. They advocate for a regulatory environment that is welcoming to technological advancements. However, investors are looking forward to Lummis’s Bitcoin stockpile bill because it could lead to a significant increase in buying pressure from the US. This would add to their existing BTC vault, which contains assets that the country’s authorities have already seized. The Senate’s evolving stance on cryptocurrency legislation comes as it prepares to introduce a comprehensive market structure bill . This follows the passage of the GENIUS Act, which seeks to establish a regulatory framework specifically for stablecoins and is set to be considered by the House next week. The broader market structure legislation aims to delineate oversight responsibilities between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Scott and Lummis have indicated their goal to pass the market structure bill by the end of September, moving the timeline back from an earlier August deadline.

In January, the Harris Poll surveyed 4,626 US adults on behalf of Northwestern Mutual. The poll shows 26% of Millennials and 30% of Gen Z respondents expect to receive an inheritance in the so-called “great wealth transfer.” Of the Millennial respondents expecting to receive inheritances, 33% said the gifts were “highly critical” and that they won’t achieve long-term financial security or be able to retire comfortably without them, compared to 28% for Gen Z. Additionally, another 36% of Millennials and 35% of Gen Z respondents rated their inheritances as “critical,” noting that they may not be able to realize long-term financial security without them. Northwestern Mutual notes that respondents from all generations demonstrated increased expectations for leaving an inheritance compared to the previous survey, while their expectations for receiving an inheritance fell. “As such, the gap between what Gen Z and Millennials say they expect in the way of an inheritance versus what their parents are actually planning to leave behind is narrowing. Notably, four in ten (39%) Gen Z adults say they plan to leave an inheritance or financial gift behind – more than any other generation.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-10T16:54:56,"Axelar Bridge Unlocks New Horizons for XRP Utility","Interoperability continues to take shape as a critical component in blockchain infrastructure, and XRP has now taken a notable step forward in this direction. A recent post from XRPL validator Vet (@Vet_X0) revealed that approximately 124,000 XRP is currently bridged via Axelar’s interoperability network. This development marks a significant moment in XRP’s integration with broader blockchain ecosystems. Axelar’s platform is designed to connect dozens of independent blockchains through a decentralized network of validators and cross-chain gateways. This enables seamless token transfers and contract calls across otherwise isolated ecosystems. This partnership comes shortly after the announcement of an integration with Wormhole to boost interoperability. The involvement of XRP on these networks suggests a growing appetite for extending its relevance beyond the confines of the XRP Ledger (XRPL). ~124,000 XRP is currently bridged via Axelar interoperability solution. pic.twitter.com/BkQE9aJAHS — Vet (@Vet_X0) July 9, 2025 Expanding XRP’s Functional Reach The Axelar bridge was launched same time as the XRPL Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Sidechain , ushering in a new era of interoperability for XRP. By bridging XRP to Axelar, holders and developers gain access to a wide array of decentralized applications (dApps) and services across more than 60 supported blockchains. These include popular platforms within the EVM ecosystem, Cosmos-based chains, and even Bitcoin Layer 2 networks. This expanded access opens up utility that XRP previously lacked in decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, and smart contract environments not natively compatible with the XRPL. 124,476 XRP have been bridged through Axelar, and prominent community members expect this figure to rise. This integration has been in the works since 2024 . For developers building with XRP, this bridge enables the integration of cross-chain functionality directly into applications without resorting to centralized exchanges or unreliable manual bridging methods. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Improving Liquidity And On-chain Programmability XRP’s interoperability with Axelar also has implications for the distribution of liquidity. Once bridged, XRP can be deployed into liquidity pools, lending protocols, or used as collateral across different ecosystems. This move directly contributes to deepening market liquidity and attracting new user segments that traditionally operate outside of the XRPL. Axelar’s integration enables XRP to be used in conjunction with programmable smart contracts via the Axelar Virtual Machine (AVM). That means developers can write logic that includes XRP as an asset within multi-chain workflows, something not previously feasible without compromising decentralization or requiring wrapped token models managed by centralized custodians. XRP now has full web3 interoperability , and as it begins to interface more directly with ecosystems outside its native ledger, its adoption and relevance within the crypto space will increase.

2025-07-10T16:52:15,"Coinbase and Perplexity create AI-crypto fused market tracker","Coinbase has announced a partnership with artificial intelligence-powered search engine Perplexity AI to deliver real-time crypto data services. The collaboration, unveiled on Thursday by CEO Brian Armstrong, could improve the quality and accessibility of market information for digital asset traders by combining AI and blockchain technology. The first phase of the integration will use Coinbase’s proprietary market data, including its COIN50 index, into Perplexity’s data systems. It will be used to power crypto market analysis for traders to track price movements before taking positions. CEO Brian Armstrong said the collaboration is the beginning of a multi-phase strategy to embed crypto functionality more deeply into AI tools. “ Users can double click into price moves to help make better informed trade decisions ,” Armstrong posted on X. He added that the goal is to reach a point where crypto wallets are fully integrated into large language models (LLMs), which he called a “huge step towards a permissionless, digital economy.” Coinbase and Perplexity create AI-crypto fused market tracker In his X post, Armstrong said he was confident that the overlap between AI and crypto will deliver exponential value to both industries. “I expect enhanced crypto functionality will be a catalyst for AI to achieve another 10x unlock,” the 42-year-old business executive wrote. Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas also commented on the partnership via X, stating: “Excited to partner with Coinbase to bring in real-time crypto data into Perplexity Finance! We will begin to surface this directly into user queries shortly.” Excited to partner with @coinbase to bring in real time crypto data into Perplexity Finance! We will begin to surface this directly into user queries shortly. https://t.co/J1vPAsQFub — Aravind Srinivas (@AravSrinivas) July 10, 2025 The LLM has already commenced ingesting Coinbase’s market data, including the COIN50 index, to support its analysis tools. The second phase of the partnership will allow Perplexity to use Coinbase’s data to directly respond to user search queries. This will include a conversational interface to improve accessibility for retail and institutional users. The timing of the announcement is just a day after Bitcoin, the world’s largest crypto by market cap, surpassed $112,000 to hit a new all-time high. Market analysts believe that search traffic tends to spike during market bull runs, and there is now a relevance for real-time crypto data integrations like the one Coinbase and Perplexity are building. Coinbase taps Copper’s ClearLoop for off-exchange settlement In a separate development also announced earlier today, Coinbase revealed it has integrated with ClearLoop, an off-exchange settlement solution developed by London-based Copper. The new service will help institutional clients transact using crypto more flexibly in their trading operations . Through ClearLoop, institutions can manage collateral and settle trades in near real-time without transferring assets directly onto the exchange. The platform’s multiparty computation (MPC) technology allows institutional clients to control their funds in centralized exchange trading. It could also reduce counterparty risk and improve capital efficiency, two long-standing concerns for professional traders operating at high volume. ClearLoop’s MPC-based model allows users to trade virtual balances on exchanges while actual settlement happens through Copper’s infrastructure. According to Coinbase, there has been “high” demand for such infrastructure upgrades among clients who want to minimize the risks associated with moving large sums onto exchanges. “ Institutions want this functionality and flexibility because ClearLoop enables a jumpstep in the off-exchange settlement times ,” a Coinbase spokesperson said. “T his improves the user experience of managing collateral, reducing counterparty risk, and improving capital efficiency .” Ethena, a stablecoin protocol recognized for supporting the synthetic dollar USDe, has been named as one of the first partners to adopt the ClearLoop integration at launch. The service is regulated under the Bermuda Monetary Authority and is available only with USDC as the collateral asset. Coinbase promised to add support for additional assets in future updates. “ This significant integration with Coinbase International Exchange expands institutional access to rapid, secure off-exchange trading and settlement ,” said Amar Kuchinad, global CEO of Copper.

The Cardano Foundation disclosed its financial allocations and asset composition in its 2024 Financial Insights Report, published on-chain on July 10. Just published: Our 2024 Financial Insights Report, fully on-chain using Reeve. Highlights: • $22.1M allocated across adoption, education, and resilience • $659.1M in assets (as of 31 Dec 2024) • 17.1M $ADA earned via staking Explore the report: https://t.co/NwKl4oEw3C — Cardano Foundation (@Cardano_CF) July 10, 2025 As of December 31, 2024, the Foundation reported total assets of $659.1 million. Of this, 76.7% was held in ADA, 14.9% in Bitcoin, and 8.3% in cash, cash equivalents, or other financial instruments. Cardano Foundation Releases 2024 Financial Report The report states that staking rewards from ADA holdings accounted for most of the organization’s income last year, totaling 17.1 million ADA from 599.2 million ADA held. The Foundation allocated $22.1 million across three functional areas—operational resilience, education, and ecosystem adoption. Another $7.1 million went toward internal operations, including governance, infrastructure, legal, and finance. Core initiatives included support for the Chang hard fork, compatibility with the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol, and funding for PRAGMA, an open-source collective. The Foundation also backed programs like the Cardano Blockchain Certified Associate and partnerships with Petrobras and Universidad Tecnológica Nacional. In terms of adoption efforts, the Foundation reported use case pilots such as a digital ballistic ID system and a real estate registry collaboration with Tokenance and YurekAI. The report emphasized traceability of expenditure by storing all disclosures directly on-chain. No forward-looking budget or projected ADA liquidation schedule was included. While ADA remains the primary asset, the Foundation’s BTC position represents partial diversification into liquid and established cryptocurrencies. Charles Hoskinson Suggests Bitcoin for Treasury In June 2025, Charles Hoskinson proposed converting $100 million of ADA into stablecoins and Bitcoin to improve Cardano’s liquidity and support DeFi growth. He said the sale could be handled off-market to avoid price disruption. He also suggested a sovereign-style fund managed by a governance board and third-party asset managers. This marked a shift from the 2024 treasury strategy, which focused solely on ADA holdings. Protocol treasuries are starting to diversify beyond native tokens to manage volatility and increase liquidity options. Some networks now include BTC or stablecoins to support spending flexibility without relying solely on internal assets. Cardano’s asset mix, and the 2025 proposal to add more external holdings, adds to this shift . It raises questions around risk control, governance structure, and transparency when treasury assets are no longer limited to a single token ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why is Bitcoin included in Cardano’s treasury? Bitcoin provides liquid and widely traded reserves, offering diversification outside ADA and aligning with broader multi-asset treasury trends. How might treasury diversification affect Cardano’s governance? Introducing Bitcoin or stablecoins may require updated governance frameworks, including third-party oversight or new voting mechanisms to manage multi-asset strategies. What distinguishes Cardano’s treasury management from other protocols? While many protocols hold their native tokens exclusively, Cardano has disclosed a substantial BTC position and is considering formal proposals to expand this approach.

2025-07-10T16:50:39,"BIT Mining Unveils Bold $300M Solana Treasury Initiative","Imagine a well-established Bitcoin miner, known for its deep roots in the proof-of-work world, suddenly making a monumental leap into the fast-paced, proof-of-stake ecosystem of Solana. This isn’t a hypothetical scenario; it’s precisely what China’s prominent Bitcoin miner , BIT Mining (BTCM), has announced. The company is setting its sights on a significant expansion into the Solana (SOL) network, with ambitious plans to raise between $200 million and $300 million to establish a dedicated SOL treasury . This strategic pivot signals a fascinating evolution in the cryptocurrency landscape, prompting us to ask: What drives such a shift, and what could it mean for the future of crypto investment ? BIT Mining’s Strategic Shift: A New Horizon For years, BIT Mining has been synonymous with large-scale Bitcoin mining operations. Their infrastructure and expertise have been honed in the demanding world of securing the Bitcoin network. However, the recent announcement on their official website marks a clear intention to diversify and embrace new opportunities. The core of this initiative is to leverage their existing capabilities to support the Solana network, which is known for its high throughput and low transaction costs. By building a substantial SOL treasury , BIT Mining aims to not only strengthen its financial reserves but also actively participate in the growth and development of the Solana ecosystem through ongoing acquisitions of SOL tokens. This move highlights a growing trend among crypto-native companies to expand beyond their initial core competencies and explore adjacent, high-growth blockchain sectors. Why Solana? The Appeal of a Robust SOL Treasury The decision to focus on Solana is not arbitrary. Solana has rapidly emerged as a leading blockchain platform, often touted as an “Ethereum killer” due to its scalability and speed. Its vibrant developer community, growing DeFi (Decentralized Finance) landscape, and burgeoning NFT (Non-Fungible Token) market make it an attractive destination for significant capital deployment. For BIT Mining, establishing a substantial SOL treasury offers several compelling advantages: Diversification: Moving beyond a single asset (Bitcoin) reduces risk and opens up new revenue streams. Ecosystem Participation: Holding SOL tokens allows BIT Mining to actively participate in Solana’s governance, staking, and dApp ecosystem, potentially generating yield. Growth Potential: Solana’s rapid adoption and technological advancements present significant upside potential for the value of their SOL holdings. Infrastructure Leverage: While different from Bitcoin mining, the company’s experience in managing large-scale hardware and data centers could be adapted to support Solana validators or other network services. This strategic move by a major Bitcoin miner like BIT Mining underscores the increasing maturity and interoperability of the blockchain space, where companies are no longer confined to a single blockchain but seek to capitalize on the strengths of multiple networks. What Does This Mean for the Bitcoin Miner Landscape? BIT Mining ‘s pivot raises important questions about the future of traditional Bitcoin mining. Is this an isolated incident, or does it signal a broader trend? While Bitcoin mining remains a lucrative industry, it faces increasing challenges related to energy consumption, regulatory scrutiny, and diminishing block rewards over time. Companies like BIT Mining, with their foresight, might be recognizing the need to adapt and explore new avenues for growth and profitability. This shift could inspire other large-scale mining operations to consider diversifying their portfolios beyond just Bitcoin. Imagine a scenario where mining companies evolve into comprehensive blockchain infrastructure providers, supporting multiple networks. This could lead to: Increased capital flow into alternative layer-1 blockchains. New business models for existing mining firms. Greater integration between different blockchain ecosystems. It’s a fascinating evolution that suggests the term “ Bitcoin miner ” might soon encompass a much broader range of activities. Navigating Crypto Investment Opportunities: A Diversified Approach For investors, BIT Mining ‘s decision serves as a powerful case study in the importance of diversification within the volatile crypto market. While Bitcoin often dominates headlines, the rapid innovation in altcoins and new blockchain paradigms offers compelling crypto investment opportunities. A treasury strategy, as adopted by BIT Mining, involves not just holding assets but often actively managing them to maximize returns and minimize risk. This can include staking, lending, or participating in DeFi protocols. Such sophisticated treasury management goes beyond simple HODLing and reflects a more institutional approach to crypto assets. This development encourages individual and institutional investors alike to look beyond the dominant narratives and explore the vast potential across the entire crypto spectrum. Understanding the fundamentals of different blockchains, their use cases, and their ecosystem growth becomes paramount for informed crypto investment decisions. The Future of Crypto Treasury Management with Solana The concept of a corporate SOL treasury , or any significant crypto treasury for that matter, is becoming increasingly common. Companies are recognizing that holding digital assets can be a strategic advantage, offering liquidity, diversification, and potential appreciation. BIT Mining’s move to build a $200-$300 million SOL treasury is a bold statement, reflecting confidence in Solana ‘s long-term viability and the potential for substantial returns. This trend suggests a future where companies, regardless of their primary industry, might hold a diverse portfolio of digital assets as part of their balance sheet, moving beyond traditional fiat-only reserves. This could pave the way for more sophisticated financial products and services tailored to corporate crypto treasuries, further legitimizing digital assets as a fundamental component of modern finance. Concluding Thoughts: A Bold Step Forward BIT Mining ‘s strategic shift to embrace Solana and build a substantial SOL treasury is more than just a company announcement; it’s a bellwether for the evolving crypto industry. It highlights the growing interoperability between blockchains, the increasing importance of diversification for established crypto entities, and the continuous search for new growth frontiers. As a major Bitcoin miner takes this ambitious leap, it reinforces the idea that innovation and adaptability are key to thriving in the dynamic world of digital assets. This move by BIT Mining could inspire a new wave of strategic alliances and diversified investments, shaping the future of crypto investment for years to come.

It recently crossed above $2,780. Arthur Hayes, the former BitMEX CEO, is betting big on Ethereum, calling for a rise to $10,000. With rising institutional inflows and a trend shift, ETH might be gearing up for a major breakout. It is currently trading at $2,782, with gains of over 4% in the last 24 hours. Arthur Hayes teased Ethereum hitting $10,000 in a recent post. He backed it with a chart showing early signs of strength in Ethereum’s price. The ETH/BTC pair is also bouncing off historic lows, which could mean a major trend shift is starting. Arise Chikun, it's time… $ETH = $10,000 Yachtzee pic.twitter.com/zRGlPh9LTJ — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) July 10, 2025 ETH/BTC Pair Shows a Key Trend Shift Ethereum has been in a steady downtrend against Bitcoin since 2021. After peaking above 0.08 BTC, ETH gradually lost ground, forming a consistent lower-high, lower-low pattern over the past two years. But it’s now showing early signs of a bounce from the 0.02 BTC level. This week’s strong move to 0.025 BTC with rising volume indicates that bullish momentum is building. In a recent Bankless podcast, Hayes had predicted that Ethereum could hit $10,000–$15,000, with global liquidity shifts and tighter capital controls. Institutional Inflows Are Picking Up Analysts note Ethereum’s growing institutional interest, citing strong inflows into ETH ETFs. Just yesterday, over $211 million flowed into Ethereum ETFs. BlackRock alone purchased $158.6 million worth of ETH. In June, whale wallets increased their ETH holdings by 36%, and liquid staking rose by nearly 1 million ETH. This shows long-term belief in the network. Ethereum also recently underwent a major upgrade, which sparked a 50% ETH rally. Hayes’s $10K prediction lines up with a rising trend, where companies are now holding Ethereum as a treasury asset. Besides, a recent Fidelity report highlights that Ethereum leads Solana and other chains in developer activity, total value locked (TVL), and stablecoin usage. ETH Outshines BTC in Futures Trading Data from Glassnode shows that Ethereum futures volume hit $62.1 billion, slightly ahead of Bitcoin’s $61.7 billion. This is a rare flip that suggests traders are shifting focus to ETH. At the same time, CME futures open interest for ETH has climbed to $3.27 billion, the highest since February, which is a clear sign of growing institutional demand. Investor Ted Pillows shared that Ethereum is currently outperforming Bitcoin, and smart money is already entering the market. He points out Ethereum’s current price pattern resembles Bitcoin’s breakout rally from 2020–2021, and a major surge could be around the corner. Experts suggest that major momentum is likely building across the broader Ethereum ecosystem in the second half of the year. Many believe that it can hit $10,000 by the end of this cycle.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/arthur-hayes-says-eth-to-10k-is-ethereums-big-breakout-coming/,"ETH|BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET","News|Ethereum",cryptocompare
2025-07-10T16:40:39,"Bitcoin Sales: Bhutan’s Astounding Strategy Outshines Germany’s Performance","In a surprising twist that has captured the attention of the global crypto community, the small Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan has remarkably outmaneuvered economic powerhouse Germany in recent Bitcoin sales performance. This unexpected development, highlighted by on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain, offers a fascinating case study in national crypto strategy and market timing. It challenges conventional wisdom and provides valuable insights into how even smaller nations can achieve significant gains in the volatile world of digital assets. Understanding the Bitcoin Sales Showdown: Bhutan vs. Germany The data presented by Lookonchain on X paints a clear, albeit astonishing, picture of two very different approaches to managing national Bitcoin reserves. While Germany, a major global economy, offloaded a substantial amount of Bitcoin, Bhutan executed a series of more strategic, higher-priced sales. Let’s break down the key figures: Germany’s Recent Bitcoin Activity: Volume Sold: 49,858 BTC Sale Period: June 19 to July 12, 2024 Total Sale Value: Approximately $2.87 billion Average Sale Price: Around $57,600 per BTC Missed Opportunity: If these coins were held, their current value would be approximately $5.54 billion, representing a missed gain of about $2.67 billion. Bhutan’s Strategic Bitcoin Sales: Volume Sold: 2,162 BTC Sale Period: Over the past year (across five transactions) Total Sale Value: Approximately $188.65 million Average Sale Price: A remarkable $87,249 per BTC To put this into perspective, here’s a comparative overview: Country BTC Sold Total Sale Value Average Sale Price Key Context / Outcome Germany 49,858 BTC $2.87 Billion $57,600 Missed $2.67 Billion in potential gains by selling at lower prices. Bhutan 2,162 BTC $188.65 Million $87,249 Achieved significantly higher average prices through strategic, staggered sales. Bhutan’s Astounding Bitcoin Strategy: A Closer Look How did Bhutan, a nation known more for its Gross National Happiness index than its crypto prowess, manage to secure such a superior average sale price for its Bhutan Bitcoin strategy ? The answer lies in a combination of factors, likely including long-term holding, strategic market timing, and perhaps a more patient approach to their digital asset reserves. Unlike Germany’s recent, seemingly urgent, large-volume sale, Bhutan’s transactions were spread out over a year, suggesting a more calculated method of profit-taking. The benefits of Bhutan’s approach are clear: Maximized Profits: By selling at an average of $87,249, Bhutan capitalized on Bitcoin’s higher price points, securing a better return on its investment. Reduced Market Impact: Spreading sales over multiple transactions and a longer period likely minimized the impact on Bitcoin’s price, preventing a significant dip that a single large sale could trigger. Strategic Patience: This approach suggests a long-term vision for their crypto holdings, waiting for opportune moments to liquidate rather than reacting to short-term market fluctuations or immediate liquidity needs. This demonstrates that even with a smaller volume, smart execution can lead to superior financial outcomes. Bhutan’s strategy might serve as a blueprint for other smaller nations or entities considering their own crypto ventures. Germany’s Crypto Holdings: What Went Wrong? Germany’s recent large-scale offloading of its Germany crypto holdings raises several questions. While the exact reasons for their sales are not publicly detailed, some possibilities include: Liquidation of Seized Assets: A significant portion of Germany’s Bitcoin holdings are believed to be seized from criminal enterprises. The sale might be part of a legal process to convert these assets into fiat currency for the state treasury. Risk Management: Governments, by nature, are often risk-averse. Selling off volatile assets like Bitcoin might be seen as a way to de-risk their balance sheets, especially amidst global economic uncertainties. Regulatory Clarity: The sales could also be a precursor to or a result of new internal policies or regulatory frameworks regarding digital assets within the German government. Missed Opportunity Cost: Regardless of the motivation, the timing resulted in a substantial missed opportunity. Selling at an average of $57,600 when Bitcoin was trading significantly higher shortly after, highlights the inherent challenge of market timing, especially for large-scale operations. The decision to sell nearly 50,000 BTC at an average price well below its recent peaks underscores the complexities and potential pitfalls of managing significant digital asset portfolios, even for sophisticated economies. Navigating Crypto Market Performance: Lessons Learned The stark contrast between Bhutan and Germany offers crucial lessons for anyone involved in the crypto space, from individual investors to institutional players. Understanding crypto market performance and how to navigate its volatility is paramount. Here are some actionable insights: The Power of Patience and Staggered Sales: Bhutan’s success underscores the benefit of not rushing to sell large quantities. Spreading sales over time can help achieve a better average price and minimize negative market impact. This is a classic dollar-cost averaging (DCA) in reverse – dollar-cost selling. Market Timing is Tricky: Even sophisticated entities can get market timing wrong. Germany’s case is a powerful reminder that predicting short-term price movements, especially for such large volumes, is incredibly difficult. For individual investors, this often translates to the adage: “Time in the market beats timing the market.” Understanding Your Goals: Are you holding for long-term appreciation, or are you looking to generate liquidity? Clear objectives are essential for any crypto strategy. Bhutan’s actions suggest a profit-taking objective from a long-term holding, while Germany’s might be more focused on liquidation or risk reduction. The Value of On-Chain Analytics: Tools like Lookonchain provide invaluable transparency into large transactions, allowing market participants to understand major movements and potentially anticipate market shifts. The Future of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption This tale of two nations also sheds light on the evolving landscape of institutional Bitcoin adoption and management. As more sovereign wealth funds, corporations, and even governments consider or expand their crypto holdings, the strategies employed by early movers like Bhutan and Germany become critical case studies. We are likely to see: Diversified National Portfolios: Nations may increasingly look to Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation or a strategic reserve asset, diversifying beyond traditional fiat and gold. Sophisticated Treasury Management: Governments will need to develop sophisticated treasury management strategies specifically tailored for highly volatile digital assets, including clear policies for acquisition, custody, and liquidation. Increased Transparency (and Scrutiny): As more institutional players enter the space, their actions will be subject to greater public and analytical scrutiny, influencing market sentiment and policy discussions. The lessons from Bhutan and Germany are not just about profit and loss; they are about the maturation of the crypto market and the increasing importance of digital assets on the global stage. Conclusion: A New Era of National Crypto Strategies The surprising success of Bhutan’s Bitcoin sales strategy over Germany’s recent performance is a compelling narrative that underscores the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. It highlights that size and traditional economic power do not automatically translate to superior performance in the digital asset space. Instead, patience, strategic timing, and a clear understanding of market dynamics appear to be the true keys to unlocking value. As nations continue to explore and integrate digital assets into their financial frameworks, the experiences of countries like Bhutan and Germany will serve as invaluable guides. They remind us that in the world of Bitcoin, shrewd strategy can indeed triumph over sheer volume, paving the way for a new era of national crypto management.

With 597,3250 BTC on its balance sheet, valued at over $66.75 billion. But behind this giant bet, new filings show risks that could force them to sell Bitcoin sooner than people think. From surprise tax bills to huge debts, here’s why Strategy’s Bitcoin fortress might not be as secure as it looks. Big Unrealized Gains, Real Tax Bills Strategy bought all its Bitcoin for around $42.4 billion, but now it’s worth over $66.67 billion. With a recent change in accounting rules (ASU 2023-08) means Strategy now has to report the value of its Bitcoin at current market prices, not just what it paid for it. Starting in 2026, this could mean a 15% minimum tax on these “paper gains.” If this happens, Strategy might owe billions in taxes, even if they haven’t sold a single Bitcoin. And they’re not sugarcoating it. The filing clearly states that if needed, they might sell Bitcoin to cover the tax bills. Taxes Could Force a Bitcoin Sale In its recent SEC filing (Form 8-K), Strategy warns that if the tax hits, they may need to sell Bitcoin or borrow more money to cover the cost. The company admits its software business alone won’t bring in enough cash to pay these taxes plus other expenses. Strategy’s money problems don’t stop at taxes. They have $8.2 billion in debt and $3.4 billion in preferred stock, creating over $350 million every year in interest and dividend payments. Some dividends must be paid in cash and can’t be skipped without penalties. Storage Isn’t Risk-Free There’s another hidden risk, if their Bitcoin custodian ever goes bankrupt, Strategy could lose access to its coins. In that situation, they’d be just another creditor trying to get their Bitcoin back. Strategy says any sudden shock could weaken the value of their holding or push them to sell faster than planned. Cash Flow Isn’t Keeping Up Strategy admits their software business isn’t generating enough money to pay off mounting obligations. Their annual cash burden, between interest and dividends, now sits north of $350 million. That includes $36.5 million in interest and $315.9 million owed to preferred shareholders. Some of those dividends must be paid in cash, no exceptions. If they can’t raise enough through new funding, they may have to sell Bitcoin.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/strategy-be-forced-to-dump-its-66-billion-bitcoin-pile/,"BTC|REGULATION|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY","News",cryptocompare
