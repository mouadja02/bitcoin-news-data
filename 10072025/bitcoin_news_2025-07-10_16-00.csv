2025-07-10T13:51:16,"$21M Flows Into First US Solana ETF as Snorter Token Approaches $1.7M Milestone","On July 8, the first US-listed spot Solana ETF – Rex-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF (SSK) – recorded $21M in net inflows. Impressively, this pushed its total inflows to a hefty $41.2M in the first four days of launching. That single-day surge surpassed the $2.02M raised in the previous three trading sessions, effectively more than doubling the total inflows into the ETF. This is fantastic news for Solana. SSK’s ability to attract more users and capital significantly boosts the network’s visibility, liquidity, and overall credibility, positioning it for even greater success moving forward. As such, it’s highly bullish for Solana-based projects, like Snorter Token ($SNORT) . Already, it has nearly raised $1.7M owing to being the backbone of a novel Telegram trading bot slated to launch in Q3 2025. Solana ETFs Still Lag Behind Bitcoin & Ethereum Still, SSK’s footprint remains relatively small compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Despite doubling on July 8, the $41.2M in inflows represents just 0.5% of Solana’s market cap, far below Bitcoin’s 0.34% and Ethereum’s 0.3% penetration rates during their ETF launches. This gap primarily stems from SSK’s structure. Around 40% of its assets are tied to offshore Solana ETFs, whereas the rest is directly invested in $SOL. Also not working in its favor is that it carries the highest fee amount of other US crypto ETFs at 0.75%. Additionally, it launched with a $600K seed basket (the initial pool of assets), far less than the $300M+ seeded by ETF giants like Fidelity and BlackRock. The SSK ETF’s impressive doubling highlights the growing early institutional interest in Solana. Should the SEC approve pending Solana ETF applications from Franklin Templeton, VanEck, and Grayscale, it could trigger a fresh wave of capital into the network. As demand for the blockchain continues to rise, Solana-based projects like $SNORT are poised to benefit from the increased activity. Now could be the perfect time to explore these low-cap opportunities before they gain significant traction. Snorter Bot Telegram Trading Bot Eyes Solana Debut $SNORT is the backbone of Snorter Bot, a crypto trading bot currently under development. Built directly on Telegram, it promises to make trading the best meme coins faster, safer, and easier. The bot will enable you to manage every part of your trading strategy from the fourth-largest messaging app worldwide : spot new tokens, snipe launches, place trades, and set stop losses. All will be achieved without compromising security. Snorter Bot will include real-time honeypot detection, rug pull alerts, and MEV protection . By doing so, it’ll shield you from malicious tokens and front-running attacks so that you don’t get caught off guard. Given that $2.2B in crypto was stolen last year , protective trading platforms like Snorter Bot have never been more necessary. It’ll initially go live on Solana to take advantage of the network’s low fees and high-speed transactions. After that, it’ll expand to EVM-compatible chains like Ethereum, BNB Chain, Avalanche, and Arbitrum. With fees as low as 0.85% for $SNORT holders, it’ll undercut top trading bots like Trojan and Maestro, which typically charge 1%. Beyond granting reduced fees, $SNORT also unlocks governance rights (anticipated around Q4 2025), additional premium features, and high-yield staking rewards, currently offering a 218% APY, which is not to be overlooked. In fact, there’s no better time to lock up some $SNORT. As more investors join the project, this percentage is likely to decrease, resulting in higher returns while also enhancing the ecosystem’s sustainability. It’s no wonder $SNORT has quickly raised $1.6M+ on presale in just a few months and shows no signs of slowing down. Buy $SNORT for Possible 861% Returns Solana’s recent ETF inflows are a clear sign of growing institutional interest, signaling a strong upward trend for the network. With the potential approval of more ETF applications by the SEC, even greater capital could flow into the blockchain. This bodes well for Solana-based projects like Snorter Token ($SNORT), which stand to benefit from the increased activity and investment. You can buy $SNORT on presale for as low as $0.0977 to get the most out of the Snorter ecosystem. Once listed on the best crypto exchanges , as promised around the end of the year, it’s projected to hit $0.94 . Thereby, there’s no better time to join for potential 861% gains. This is not financial advice. Always do your own research (DYOR) and make informed decisions based on your own risk tolerance.

2025-07-10T13:45:22,"Animoca Brands, DDC Enterprise take first steps toward $100M BTC treasury plan","Animoca Brands is expanding its role as a Web3 and gaming fund, recently joining DDC Enterprise in a bid to expand its BTC treasury. The VC fund and gaming startup will contribute up to $100M for its treasury strategy. Anomica Brands struck a partnership with DDC Enterprise, with the goal of injecting $100M for BTC treasury expansion. With this move, Animoca Brands shifts its attention from Web3 startups and games, aiming to allocate a part of its assets back to BTC. So far, Animoca Brands has raised $825.9M, which have been used for its own games, as well as for startups. The company started its fundraising efforts in 2015, and continued through several bull markets, building up a significant ETH and BTC treasury. The exact BTC holdings are not specified, but the company has an extensive crypto portfolio, accrued over the years. “ Our partnership with DDC enables Animoca Brands to enhance the value of our blockchain technologies and maximize the value of our Bitcoin holdings,” added Yat Siu, co-founder and executive chairman of Animoca Brands. Animoca Brands joined the BTC treasury trend after slowing down its VC investments into riskier early-stage projects. Animoca Brands to advice on BTC yield strategies DDC Enterprise Limited (DDC) signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding with Animoca Brands. The fund will help DDC to develop and implement yield strategy for the current BTC treasury. Animoca Brands will extend help and allocate up to $100M in BTC toward yield enhancement strategies operated by DDC. The move will accelerate the DDC accumulation strategy, in addition to its recent $528M financing package. The fundraising is split between PIPE raises, a $300M convertible note, $200M equity line, and a $2M equity private placement. Yat Siu, the co-founder and executive chairman of Animoca Brands, will join DDC’s Bitcoin Visionary Council, providing guidance on the company’s Bitcoin treasury operations. DDC has a relatively small treasury of 138 BTC, starting out in May this year. The company’s BTC treasury is part of the latest wave of companies pivoting into BTC and planning larger purchases with the help of credit facilities. Animoca Brands is also involved with DigitalX, an Australian treasury company. The fund invested just $20.7M into DigitalX, as a precursor to its largest deal to date. DDC trades near a six-month high DDC is one of the treasury companies that benefitted from its BTC purchases in the short term. The stock is trading near its highest level for the year to date period, recovering to $11. However, DDC is still far from its peak from November 2023, when the stock traded above $155. Unlike other treasury companies, DDC will continue expanding its food business, retaining BTC as its core reserve asset. DDC has promised an aggressive accumulation strategy, while still retaining a portfolio of food brands. Despite the sliding stock price, the DDC portfolio of brands is on the verge of being cash-positive, making for a viable combination of real-world business and a BTC treasury. Previously, DDC has stated it intends to build a treasury of 5,000 BTC, turning into a medium-sized corporate holder. The company is one of the first to mix financing deals for acquiring BTC, while tapping a partner that may have coins on hand for an OTC deal.

After closing 0.6% higher on Wednesday, the S&P 500 opened near the flatline and is hugging its record high zone. The S&P 500, the benchmark index, was up 0.06%, benefiting from the upbeat sentiment around Nvidia (NVDA), a company that has rode the overall bullish outlook for stocks to storm to the $4 trillion valuation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite were little changed, with the blue-chip index down 38 points and the Nasdaq up 0.02%. You might also like: Dow Jones loses 100 points as markets eye Trump’s tariff moves Nvidia surge helps Nasdaq to record high Nvidia’s run to staggering heights in terms of market cap has aligned with the artificial intelligence chipmaker’s massive stock price surge. While NVDA has jumped 13% in the past month and 17% year-to-date, it has soared some 1,454% in the past five years and has been in an uptrend since breaking above $31.50 in November 2021. The AI chipmaker’s stock closed 1.8% higher on July 9, 2025, trading at $162 and helping the Nasdaq Composite hit a new record high . Comparatively, the S&P 500 has advanced 6.7% year-to-date and 96% in the past five years. Investor focus will be on the next moves on the tariffs front, particularly around deals with U.S. trade partners China, the United Kingdom, India, and the European Union. Trump has also threatened an additional 10% tariff on BRICS countries. Also attracting market attention will be U.S. weekly jobless claims and the Federal Reserve’s next move regarding interest rates. Positive news around these factors may help dilute any potential headwinds from the global trade war. While analysts have noted a potential sell signal for the S&P 500 as it looks to rally above 6,300, some experts are forecasting a continuation. “This is a broad-based global bull market and we don’t think it’s slowing down anytime soon,” Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group, told CNBC. The bullish sentiment also engulfs the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin ( BTC ) rising to a new all-time high above $112k. Altcoins are also largely up.

2025-07-10T13:31:39,"Bitcoin could reach between $250,000 and $350,000","Bitcoin’s price is seen as a market bellwether. Analyst Matthew (@OneBasedMoney) suggests it follows a power law model , doubling roughly every 12.7% of its lifespan—indicating exponential, not linear, growth. Currently, Bitcoin is in a quiet phase, often a precursor to major bullish runs. Macro Outlook & Scarcity Matthew compares Bitcoin to fiat money supply (~$26T), which is expected to rise due to future monetary easing. As fiat is devalued, scarce assets like Bitcoin (21M cap) become more attractive, reinforcing its role as a hedge against inflation. Price Target: $250K–$350K by End of 2025 Based on his model, Bitcoin could reach $250,000–$350,000 by late 2025 / early 2026 , aligning with previous cycle peaks. Matthew believes Bitcoin’s value is now driven 95% by internal adoption trends—not macro events—highlighting a maturing market led by users, tech, and institutions. Final Surge Likely While long-term growth may slow, a euphoric end-of-cycle rally remains probable, fueled by rising spot ETF interest and institutional flows. However, questions linger about Bitcoin’s role as fiat expands and markets evolve. Conclusion: Bullish Outlook Despite uncertainties, Bitcoin’s fundamentals—fixed supply, growing adoption, and institutional interest—support a strong bullish case.

2025-07-10T13:20:11,"Bitcoin’s Explosive Surge: Unlocking the $133K Potential by September","Are you ready for a potential seismic shift in the crypto landscape? The world of digital assets is abuzz with a bold Bitcoin price prediction that could see the leading cryptocurrency reach an astonishing $133,000 by September. This isn’t just wishful thinking; it’s a meticulously crafted forecast from a respected crypto market research firm, 10x Research, that has caught the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike. If you’ve been tracking Bitcoin’s journey, this latest analysis offers a compelling reason to pay closer attention. What’s Fueling This Bold Bitcoin Price Prediction? The latest bullish sentiment surrounding Bitcoin stems directly from insights provided by Markus Thielen, a prominent analyst at 10x Research. According to Cointelegraph, Thielen’s firm has identified a significant shift in their internal trend model. On June 29, this model officially turned bullish, signaling a strong probability of continued upside momentum for Bitcoin over the next two months. This isn’t just a hunch; it’s a data-driven assessment that assigns a substantial 60% probability to this upward trajectory. Thielen emphasizes that historical trends often provide a reliable compass for future price movements. Based on current levels near $111,000, a 20% gain, as suggested by historical patterns, would indeed propel BTC to the $133,000 mark. While the third quarter (Q3) of the year has historically been a weaker period for Bitcoin, Thielen believes that the current cycle possesses unique characteristics that could defy this established trend. This defiance could be attributed to a confluence of factors, including renewed institutional interest and evolving macroeconomic conditions that favor digital assets. Decoding the BTC Market Analysis: Beyond the Numbers To truly appreciate the significance of 10x Research’s forecast, it’s essential to delve deeper into the broader BTC market analysis . The prediction isn’t isolated; it’s part of a complex interplay of on-chain data, derivatives market activity, and macroeconomic indicators. One of the key drivers cited is the robust demand for call options. But what does this mean, and why is it so important? Understanding Bitcoin Call Options: What they are: Call options give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy an asset (in this case, Bitcoin) at a specified price (the strike price) on or before a certain date. Why strong demand is bullish: High demand for call options, especially those with higher strike prices, indicates that a significant number of market participants anticipate a substantial price increase. They are willing to pay a premium for the potential to profit from future upside. Market sentiment indicator: This demand acts as a strong indicator of bullish sentiment among sophisticated traders and institutional players who use derivatives for hedging or speculative purposes. Furthermore, the market’s current structure, particularly in the derivatives space, suggests a leaning towards bullish outcomes. Traders are positioning themselves for upward movement, which can create a self-fulfilling prophecy to some extent, as positive sentiment attracts more capital. Navigating Current Crypto Market Trends and Their Impact The bullish outlook for Bitcoin isn’t happening in a vacuum. It’s intrinsically linked to the broader crypto market trends that have been shaping the digital asset landscape. Several factors are converging to create a fertile ground for potential price appreciation: Key Drivers Influencing Bitcoin’s Trajectory: Factor Description Impact on Bitcoin Institutional Adoption Continued inflow into spot Bitcoin ETFs, indicating growing acceptance from traditional finance. Increases demand, provides regulatory clarity, and adds legitimacy to Bitcoin as an asset class. Halving Event Aftermath The supply shock from the recent Bitcoin halving is gradually manifesting in reduced selling pressure from miners. Creates a scarcity effect, historically leading to significant price rallies in the months following the event. Macroeconomic Environment Potential shifts in interest rate policies, inflation concerns, and global economic stability. Bitcoin can act as a hedge against inflation or a safe haven asset during economic uncertainty, attracting capital. Technological Advancements Ongoing development within the Bitcoin ecosystem (e.g., Lightning Network, Ordinals) enhancing utility and adoption. Improves scalability, reduces transaction costs, and broadens Bitcoin’s use cases, making it more attractive. The narrative around Bitcoin is evolving from a speculative asset to a legitimate component of diversified investment portfolios. This shift is crucial for sustained growth and attracting larger pools of capital, which can certainly contribute to the kind of upward movement predicted by 10x Research. The Strategic Importance of Bitcoin Call Options for Market Momentum The emphasis on strong demand for Bitcoin call options by Markus Thielen is not just a passing comment; it’s a critical piece of the puzzle for understanding the current market dynamics. Call options are powerful tools in the derivatives market, and their heightened activity signals a sophisticated positioning by large investors. When institutions and whales purchase significant volumes of call options, especially out-of-the-money (OTM) calls (options with strike prices higher than the current market price), it indicates a strong belief that the underlying asset’s price will rise substantially before the option expires. This creates a positive feedback loop: Increased open interest: More call options being held suggests a collective bullish bet. Dealer hedging: Option sellers (dealers) often hedge their positions by buying the underlying asset (Bitcoin) as the price approaches the strike price. This hedging activity itself can contribute to upward price pressure. Market sentiment amplification: The visible demand for calls can inspire confidence among other market participants, leading to further buying. This confluence of factors, driven by the strategic use of derivatives, adds a layer of robustness to the prediction. It’s not merely based on technical chart patterns but also on the positioning of significant capital within the market. Insights from 10x Research Outlook: What Does It Mean for Your Portfolio? The 10x Research outlook presents an exciting prospect for Bitcoin investors, but it’s crucial to approach such predictions with a balanced perspective. While the $133,000 target by September is compelling, it’s essential to consider both the potential benefits and inherent challenges. Benefits of a Bullish Outlook: Significant Capital Appreciation: For current holders, a move to $133,000 represents substantial gains, validating long-term conviction in Bitcoin. Increased Market Confidence: A strong rally can attract new investors and re-engage dormant ones, further strengthening the overall crypto market. Positive Ecosystem Impact: A rising Bitcoin price often pulls altcoins higher, benefiting the broader digital asset ecosystem. Potential Challenges and Risks: Market Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its dramatic price swings. While the prediction is bullish, sharp corrections can occur. Analyst Predictions Are Not Guarantees: While 10x Research is reputable, market forecasts are inherently speculative and subject to unforeseen events. Macroeconomic Headwinds: Unexpected global economic downturns, regulatory crackdowns, or geopolitical conflicts could derail even the most optimistic forecasts. Profit-Taking: As Bitcoin approaches significant price targets, some investors may opt to take profits, leading to temporary pullbacks. Actionable Insights for Investors: Given this optimistic yet cautious outlook, what should investors consider? Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always verify information and understand the underlying factors driving any prediction. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders or using dollar-cost averaging to mitigate risk. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: While a September target is short-term, Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition remains a key consideration for many investors. Diversification: While Bitcoin may be a strong performer, a diversified portfolio across various assets can help manage risk. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news, regulatory developments, and on-chain metrics that can influence Bitcoin’s price. The current market sentiment, bolstered by the analysis from 10x Research, paints a promising picture for Bitcoin’s near future. The confluence of a bullish trend model, strong demand for call options, and supportive macroeconomic factors suggests that Bitcoin could indeed be poised for a significant upward movement. A September Surge on the Horizon? The prospect of Bitcoin hitting $133,000 by September, as projected by 10x Research, injects a fresh wave of excitement and optimism into the crypto market. Markus Thielen’s analysis, grounded in a bullish trend model and robust demand for Bitcoin call options, offers a compelling narrative for the coming months. While Q3 has historically been a quieter period for Bitcoin, this cycle appears to be charting a different course, potentially defying past trends due to strong underlying fundamentals and evolving market dynamics. As always, the crypto market remains dynamic and unpredictable, but the signals from 10x Research provide a powerful indicator that Bitcoin’s journey towards new highs may just be getting started. For those tracking the digital gold, the next few months promise to be exceptionally interesting.

2025-07-10T13:19:10,"Bitcoin price analysis after hitting new all-time high: further gains or return to range lows?","Bitcoin has surged into major resistance at $111,250 after a bullish expansion. Without volume confirmation, price risks rejection and another rotation back toward range lows near $98,270. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is once again confronting a critical decision point as price trades into a long-standing high time frame resistance zone around $111,250. This level marks the current range high and has historically served as a ceiling for price action. Following a sharp bullish reaction from the value area high, BTC has made a strong push upward, but without sustained volume, the risk of rejection remains. Whether this area is broken with conviction or rejected again will likely dictate Bitcoin’s directional trend in the coming weeks and months. Key technical points Resistance at $111,250: High time frame range top and key structural level. Bullish Reaction from Value Area High: Recent breakout was aggressive but lacks sustained volume. Still Range-Bound: Between $111,250 resistance and $98,270 support. BTCUSD (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has posted a bullish expansion, lifting off from the value area high and surging into high time frame resistance. The level at $111,250 is not a random price zone, it marks a critical structural resistance that has capped prior attempts at higher prices. Structurally, Bitcoin remains within a wide trading range, with historical rejections from both the range high and range low resulting in full oscillations between the two extremes. You might also like: Australia begins second phase of tokenized asset and CBDC settlement trials with major banks Despite the strength of the recent move, price has not yet confirmed a true breakout. A decisive breakout would require strong candle closures above resistance and, most importantly, sustained volume influx. So far, this has not occurred, leaving the door open to a liquidity grab scenario, where stop orders from short sellers are triggered just before price stalls and reverses. If Bitcoin fails to push through $111,250 with volume-backed momentum, the likelihood of a range continuation increases. This would open the probability for a rotation back toward the lower boundary of the range, near $98,270, where resting liquidity remains uncollected. Such moves are typical in high time frame consolidations, where price oscillates between known liquidity zones until a true breakout or breakdown occurs. Until a clear breakout confirms the change in structure, Bitcoin remains technically range-bound, and caution is warranted. Price is at resistance, and without bullish follow-through, the probability favors another leg down within the existing range. What to expect in the coming price action If Bitcoin fails to break above $111,250 with conviction and volume, expect a rotation lower toward $98,270. A breakout with strong volume, however, could trigger a new all-time high attempt.

His announcement, paired with Bitcoin’s 82% surge over the past year to $109,323, signals a bullish shift for digital assets. Investors are now eyeing opportunities beyond Bitcoin. They are further favouring projects with robust fundamentals and long-term potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently in Phase 5 of its presale, is emerging as a standout with over 12,000,000 raised and more than 580 million tokens sold to 13,000 holders. This DeFi project, built on a secure lending protocol, offers a compelling case for those exploring which crypto to buy for long-term gains. Mutuum Finance’s presale success Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is advancing swiftly through its presale, now in Phase 5 at $0.03 per token. This price reflects a 200% increase from the opening phase’s $0.01, showcasing strong investor demand. With over 65% of Phase 5 filled, the window to secure tokens at this level is narrowing rapidly. Phase 6 will bring a 16.7% price hike to $0.035, and the token is set to launch at $0.06, guaranteeing a 100% return for current buyers. Analysts project even greater upside, with some estimating a $3 post-launch value in 2025, driven by the project’s innovative DeFi framework. Moreover, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has solidified its credibility with a CertiK audit, earning a 95.00 security score with no vulnerabilities found. Innovative lending for DeFi growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is redefining decentralized lending with a dual-model approach. Its Peer-to-Contract system uses smart contracts to automate lending, offering dynamic interest rates that adapt to crypto market shifts. This ensures stability for both lenders and borrowers.

This is one of the flexibility features that distinguishes Mutuum Finance (MUTM), as it provides transparency and control compared with centralized platforms. The project also rewards top investors through a leaderboard dashboard, granting bonus tokens to the top 50 holders. Furthermore, a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program with CertiK reinforces its commitment to security across the crypto market. Stablecoin and scalability solutions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum, minimizing depegging risks common in algorithmic tokens.

Consequently, these features make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a strong contender in crypto investing. Bitcoin’s institutional momentum Bitcoin’s rally, fueled by Musk’s America Party and $11 billion in ETF inflows, underscores its growing role as digital gold. Institutional adoption is stabilizing its crypto prices, making it a reliable hedge against fiat uncertainties. However, its high entry point limits accessibility for some. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), with its lower price and 100% ROI at launch, offers a more affordable entry into the crypto market. While Bitcoin leads, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s innovative lending and stablecoin plans provide unique utility. Additionally, its mtToken system rewards stakers with buybacks, creating passive income streams that Bitcoin lacks. Looking ahead with confidence Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving itself as a top choice for those deciding which crypto to buy for long-term success. Its presale, now at $0.03, offers a rare opportunity to secure tokens before the $0.06 launch, with projections of reaching $3 in 2025. The project’s audited contracts, innovative lending models, and upcoming stablecoin make it a standout in crypto investing.

2025-07-10T13:16:06,"BTCS: The Rise Of The Ethereum Treasury Company?","Summary BTCS Inc. is a U.S.-based, publicly traded digital asset company that has recently gained significant attention after years of low market cap. Shares of BTCS have surged 140% year-to-date and over 600% in the last three years, driven by the company's plan to be an ETH Treasury business. The company, originally known as Bitcoin Shop, has evolved from an online Bitcoin marketplace to a broader blockchain technology player. While the hype isn't totally without merit, the $225 million ATM should give serious investors plenty of pause. Crypto company investors could be forgiven for having never heard of BTCS Inc. ( BTCS ) before. Despite being both U.S.-based and one of the oldest digital asset-related companies in the public markets, the stock has generally traded well below a $100 million market cap until recently: Data by YCharts Shares of BTCS are currently up 140% year to date and over 600% over the last 3 years. Typically when there are spikes in price/valuation to this magnitude, there is a primary catalyst and BTCS is no different. In this article, we'll look at what is driving the recent hype in BTCS shares as well as assess whether the stock is a 'buy' on news. BTCS Through The Years BTCS, an abbreviation for Blockchain Technology Consensus Solutions, used to be known as ""Bitcoin Shop."" Back when the company launched in 2014, it was primarily operating an online marketplace that accepted Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) for consumer goods similar to a company like Amazon ( AMZN ). After going public via reverse merger shortly after inception, BTCS quickly pivoted to Bitcoin mining which proved to be a challenging business for the company. Data by YCharts After essentially four straight years without revenue of any kind, the stock was up-listed to the Nasdaq back in 2021 in conjunction with yet another business pivot to Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) staking solutions, blockchain analytics tools, and digital asset treasury growth. This, admittedly brief, recap brings us to today where we have a stock ripping higher and now valued at about 20 times trailing sales. Ethereum Treasury Company As is quickly becoming normalized by companies like Bit Digital ( BTBT ) and Upexi ( UPXI ), digital asset treasury businesses utilizing tokens down cap of Bitcoin have become potentially viable ways for public companies to raise capital. This is what BTCS is now also attempting through an announced $225 million ETH purchase target on July 9th . While ETH has badly lagged Bitcoin in price for nearly three full years, it is still the native token of one of the most important blockchain ecosystems in the Digital Asset sector and claims the largest stablecoin TVL with $126 billion and roughly 50% share of market. Stablecoin Share By Chain (DeFi Llama) Given the apparent priority stablecoin regulation is now getting in the United States, validating transactions in the Ethereum ecosystem is dramatically cheaper than that of Bitcoin. Furthermore, unlike Bitcoin Treasury companies which don't typically mine the asset as well, ETH Treasury companies can natively stake their assets to generate positive returns for shareholders with minimal capex. BTCS, Investor Deck Even if the price of ETH stays exactly where it is, a positive operating return is to be expected assuming the company doesn't spend frivolously through SG&A or R&D. Data by YCharts At the end of March, BTCS had $21 million in total assets and a tangible book value of just under $18 million. The company reported just $270k in cash and about $20 million in crypto assets - most of which were staked. So the key question then; how does a company with just $21 million in total assets raise this capital to buy nearly a quarter of a billion in ETH? Answer: an ATM, among other things. On July 8th, BTCS CEO Charles Allen posted details on X of what was originally just a $100 million capital raise: This multi-pronged flywheel utilizes ATM sales, convertible debt, on-chain AAVE ( AAVE-USD ) borrowing, staking rewards, and Builder+—our proprietary block-building platform—to grow $ETH per share, drive revenue, and protect shareholder value by minimizing dilution. So far, we only have specific details of the ATM. The ATM Through a prospectus filed on July 8th, BTCS filed a $225 million common stock ATM: In accordance with the terms of the Offering Agreement, we may offer and sell shares of our Common Stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $225,000,000 from time to time through the Agent. Our Common Stock is traded on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “BTCS.” On July 7, 2025, the last reported sale price of our Common Stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market was $2.80 per share. For a company worth about $18 million, this is a serious amount of dilution. At the end of March, there were 20,206,880 shares outstanding. So far, it appears that BTCS has sold 600,000 additional shares to raise just under $3 million about $5 per share. Notably, the prospectus lays out more than just ETH purchases for use of ATM proceeds: We intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of the securities by us to provide additional funds for purchasing digital assets, working capital, and other general corporate purposes. As of the date of this prospectus supplement, we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses of the proceeds from this offering . Accordingly, we will retain broad discretion over the use of such proceeds Bold above is my emphasis. I don't doubt that the majority of capital raised from this ATM will be utilized to buy ETH, but the fact that a specific percentage isn't laid out should give any investor chasing this rally pause from where I sit. Closing Summary If it wasn't implied strongly enough above, I would be very cautious chasing this stock. BTCS has been a penny stock throughout its existence. And while I'll over the company some slack due to it being a cryptocurrency company throughout its entire existence, I think the pivot to ETH is more of a desperation play than anything else. Short squeezes with these kinds of stocks are always possible, so I'm not going to call it an outright 'sell.' But there is no way I'd put on 'buy' on this company at this point in time.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800341-btcs-rise-of-the-ethereum-treasury-company?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BUSINESS|ETH|REGULATION|BTC|MARKET","BTCS",cryptocompare

Key Takeaways: BIT Mining plans to raise $300 million to build a SOL treasury and shift away from Bitcoin. The company will convert all existing crypto holdings into SOL and begin operating validator nodes. Its pivot aligns with a growing trend of firms betting on Solana. The move marks a departure from its previous focus on Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Ethereum Classic mining, the company said in a Thursday press release . The company will convert all existing crypto assets into SOL and adopt a long-term holding strategy, citing Solana’s performance, infrastructure, and developer community as key drivers behind the pivot. BIT Mining to Riase Funds in Phases To support its new direction, BIT Mining plans to raise funds in phases, based on market conditions and capital availability. It will also begin running validator nodes on Solana, aiming to contribute to network decentralization and security while earning staking rewards. “We’re excited to take this bold step into what we believe is one of the most dynamic and promising ecosystems in the blockchain space,” said CEO Xianfeng Yang. “With our strong execution capabilities and long-term vision, we are confident in our ability to accelerate sustainable growth and deliver lasting value to our shareholders.” BIT Mining, currently the 17th largest public Bitcoin miner by market cap, operates across mining, hosting, and hardware production.

The pivot aligns BIT Mining with a rising group of firms reshaping their treasury strategies around digital assets. Last week, DeFi Development Corp. revealed that it has acquired $2.7 million worth of Solana as part of its aggressive crypto treasury strategy. Likewise, Canadian digital asset firm Sol Strategies, already trading on the Canadian Securities Exchange, holds over 420,000 SOL tokens, positioning itself as a significant institutional player in Solana’s ecosystem. Last month, the firm also filed to list its common shares on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker “STKE” as it ramps up its U.S. expansion. In its SEC filing, Sol Strategies emphasized its focus on Solana, citing the blockchain’s growing role in asset tokenization and digital infrastructure as key drivers for future growth. More Public Companies Diversify into Crypto Following the model pioneered by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, more public companies are diversifying into crypto holdings that include BTC, ETH, SOL, and XRP. Two other mining firms with “Bit” in their name have also reoriented around Ethereum in recent weeks. Bit Digital recently exited Bitcoin mining and acquired over 100,000 ETH after raising $173 million. Meanwhile, BitMine plans to raise $250 million to scale its ETH treasury, with Fundstrat’s Tom Lee joining as board chair. The announcement came after BIT Mining’s $10 million settlement in November with the U.S. Department of Justice and SEC over bribery allegations tied to its former business as 500.com, a Chinese lottery operator.

2025-07-10T13:10:42,"Urgent: Bitcoin Depot Data Breach Exposes 27K Users’ Sensitive Info","The world of cryptocurrency, while promising innovation and financial freedom, is not without its perils. A recent revelation from Bitcoin Depot , a major player in the Bitcoin ATM space, serves as a stark reminder of these risks. The company has publicly disclosed a significant data breach that has left nearly 27,000 users vulnerable, raising critical questions about crypto security and the safeguarding of precious user data . What Exactly Happened with Bitcoin Depot’s Data Breach? On June 23, 2024, an unfortunate incident unfolded within Bitcoin Depot’s systems. An external compromise led to unauthorized access to sensitive information belonging to a substantial portion of its user base. Specifically, approximately 27,000 individuals found their personal details exposed. The compromised user data included: Names Phone numbers Driver’s license numbers This type of information is highly valuable to malicious actors, as it can be used for various forms of identity theft and targeted scams. While Bitcoin Depot has stated that no evidence of data misuse has been found so far, the potential for future harm remains a serious concern for those affected. Why Was There a Delay in Notifying Affected Users? One aspect of this data breach that has drawn particular attention is the significant delay in notification. The incident occurred in June 2024, but the public disclosure came much later. According to a company spokesperson, this delay was not due to negligence on their part but was a direct request from federal law enforcement. An ongoing investigation required the information to be withheld to avoid compromising the probe, which reportedly concluded in mid-June 2025. This timeline, though lengthy, highlights the complex interplay between corporate responsibility, user transparency, and the demands of criminal investigations. While such delays can be frustrating for users who are left unaware of potential risks, they are sometimes deemed necessary by authorities to catch perpetrators or prevent further damage. However, it also underscores the challenges in maintaining digital privacy when external factors dictate disclosure timelines. How Does This Incident Impact User Data and Digital Privacy? The exposure of personal identifiers like names, phone numbers, and especially driver’s license numbers, carries significant risks. For the 27,000 affected Bitcoin Depot users, this could mean: Identity Theft: Malicious actors can use driver’s license numbers and other personal data to open fraudulent accounts, apply for loans, or even commit crimes in your name. Phishing and Social Engineering: Knowing your name and phone number allows scammers to craft highly convincing phishing emails or text messages, pretending to be legitimate entities to trick you into revealing more sensitive information or clicking malicious links. Targeted Scams: The information can be used to tailor scams specifically to you, making them more believable and harder to detect. For instance, they might know you use Bitcoin ATMs, making a crypto-related scam more plausible. This incident serves as a critical reminder that even in the decentralized world of cryptocurrency, centralized entities like ATM operators hold a significant amount of your personal information, making their crypto security protocols paramount to your digital privacy . What Can Users Do to Protect Themselves After a Data Breach? If you are among the 27,000 users affected by the Bitcoin Depot data breach , or even if you’re not, taking proactive steps is crucial for safeguarding your digital privacy : Monitor Your Accounts: Regularly check your bank statements, credit card statements, and credit reports for any suspicious activity. You can get a free credit report annually from each of the three major credit bureaus. Change Passwords: While passwords weren’t explicitly mentioned as compromised, it’s always good practice to update passwords for any accounts linked to your Bitcoin Depot profile or email, especially if you reuse passwords. Use strong, unique passwords for each service. Be Wary of Phishing Attempts: Be extremely cautious of unsolicited emails, texts, or calls. Cybercriminals often capitalize on data breaches by sending out fake alerts or offers to trick victims. Always verify the sender and never click on suspicious links. Consider a Credit Freeze: This is one of the most effective ways to prevent identity theft. A credit freeze restricts access to your credit report, making it difficult for fraudsters to open new accounts in your name. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): For all your online accounts, especially financial ones and crypto exchanges, enable 2FA. This adds an extra layer of security, making it much harder for unauthorized users to gain access even if they have your password. Report Suspicious Activity: If you notice any unauthorized activity, report it immediately to your bank, relevant companies, and law enforcement. These measures are not just for those impacted by this specific data breach but are essential practices for anyone navigating the digital landscape, especially within the cryptocurrency ecosystem where crypto security threats are ever-present. Enhancing Crypto Security: Lessons for the Industry This incident is a stark reminder for all cryptocurrency service providers, including ATM operators, exchanges, and wallets, about the critical importance of robust crypto security infrastructure. While Bitcoin Depot attributed the breach to an “external system compromise,” it highlights the need for continuous vigilance and investment in cybersecurity measures. Key areas for improvement and focus include: Regular Security Audits: Independent third-party audits can identify vulnerabilities before they are exploited. Employee Training: Human error is often a weak link. Comprehensive training on cybersecurity best practices is crucial. Advanced Threat Detection: Implementing sophisticated systems to detect and respond to unusual network activity or unauthorized access attempts. Data Minimization: Collecting and retaining only the absolutely necessary user data . The less data stored, the less there is to lose in a breach. Encryption: Ensuring all sensitive user data , both in transit and at rest, is strongly encrypted. Incident Response Plans: Having a clear, tested plan for how to respond to a breach, including communication strategies and recovery protocols. Maintaining high standards of crypto security is not just a technical challenge but a matter of building and maintaining user trust. In an industry built on decentralization and trustless systems, the centralized points of failure, like data repositories, become critical targets. Protecting digital privacy must be at the core of every operation. The Broader Implications for Trust in the Crypto Ecosystem Every data breach , regardless of the company, chips away at public trust in the digital economy. For the cryptocurrency sector, which is still striving for mainstream adoption and regulatory clarity, such incidents can be particularly damaging. They reinforce perceptions of the crypto space as risky or insecure, potentially deterring new users and institutional investors. The future growth of Bitcoin ATMs and other crypto services heavily relies on the confidence users place in their security measures. When user data is compromised, it directly impacts this trust. Companies like Bitcoin Depot bear a significant responsibility to not only provide convenient services but also to be impenetrable fortresses for the sensitive information they collect. The industry as a whole must learn from these incidents, continuously adapt, and prioritize digital privacy and robust crypto security to ensure a safe and sustainable future. Conclusion: Navigating the Digital Wild West with Vigilance The Bitcoin Depot data breach serves as a potent reminder that even as the cryptocurrency world evolves, the fundamental challenges of cybersecurity and digital privacy remain. For 27,000 users, this incident is a direct threat to their personal security, necessitating immediate action and ongoing vigilance. For the broader crypto industry, it’s a call to action to redouble efforts in fortifying defenses and earning the unwavering trust of users. As we continue to navigate the exciting yet sometimes perilous landscape of digital finance, staying informed, proactive, and demanding the highest standards of crypto security from all service providers is not just advisable—it’s essential for protecting your valuable user data and ensuring your peace of mind.

2025-07-10T13:09:39,"Here’s why Bitcoin and crypto prices are in a bull run today","Bitcoin and crypto prices resumed their bull run this week, helped by numerous tailwinds. Bitcoin ( BTC ) surged to a record high of $112,000, while the crypto market cap jumped to over $3.5 trillion. The rally occurred amid ongoing risk-on sentiment in the financial markets, as investors disregarded trade-related risks. One example was the rising Fear and Greed Index, which moved into the extreme greed zone of 75. Another notable development was the surging NVIDIA stock price , which reached a record high, with its market capitalization surpassing $4 trillion for the first time. Crypto prices often exhibit a close correlation with technology stocks, as both are characterized as high-risk assets. BTC and altcoins also advanced as demand from Wall Street investors continued rising. For example, spot Bitcoin ETFs crossed the important $50 billion inflow milestone for the first time after adding $218 million in assets on Wednesday.

In a note, an analyst told Bloomberg : “Voracious demand from equity market vehicles such as ETFs and digital-asset Treasuries has underpinned a continuous bid for Bitcoin.” Crypto prices also advanced after the Federal Reserve released the minutes from its last meeting. These minutes showed that some Fed officials expect Trump’s tariffs to have a limited impact on inflation. As such, analysts are penciling in a 0.25% rate cut at the September meeting. Trump has called for a 300 basis point cut. Bitcoin price technicals contributed to the crypto rally BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news As we have written here and here , Bitcoin price has formed several bullish patterns that have contributed to the rally. It formed a cup-and-handle pattern and a bullish flag on the daily chart. It has now moved above the upper side of the cup and the flag, pointing to an eventual breakout. By measuring the size of the flag and the depth of the cup, one can estimate that Bitcoin price will eventually advance above $140,000 in the next few months. Such a move would then trigger further gains among altcoins like Ethereum and Cardano.

2025-07-10T13:04:15,"US Ethereum Spot ETFs See Second-Highest Inflows in Five Months","US Ethereum spot ETFs hit the second-highest peak in five months and the third-highest this year, as investors highlight a significant increase in institutional interest in this vehicle. On 9 July, the US ETH spot exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) saw inflows surge to $211.32 million . This is a significant increase from $46.63 million a day before. But most notably, this is the second-highest amount in over five months. It’s also the third-highest amount in 2025 so far. More precisely, the highest increase in this period is $240.29 from 11 June this year. The previous peak is $307.77 million, seen on 4 February. This means that between 5 February and today, this is the ETFs’ second-highest inflow, as well as the third-highest since the beginning of the year. Overall, the all-time high still stands at $428.44 million. The amount was recorded on 5 December 2024. Following the launch of nine US spot bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, the ETH spot ETFs began trading in July that year. The chart below shows flows since the launch (red and green), as well as the total net assets (white). Source: SoSoValue Moreover, the cumulative total net inflow climbed to $4.72 billion as of 9 July. Total valued traded stood at $1.26 billion, while total net assets were at $11.84 billion, or 3.58% of Ethereum market cap. Of the $211.32 million in inflows, BlackRock took in $158.62 million. Four more Ethereum spot ETFs saw positive flows, and none saw negative flows. Fidelity’s share is $29.53 million, followed by Grayscale’s $17.96 million and Franklin’s $5.21 million.

Ethereum ETFs: ‘Inflows Surpass 61,000 ETH’ Analysts are highlighting an increased interest in Ethereum spot ETFs in particular. This factor, they argue, is likely to benefit the coin’s price as well as it pushes higher. Onchain data and intelligence platform Glassnode noted on Monday that spot ETF flows remained positive for the 8 th consecutive week. Inflows surpassed 61,000 ETH, it said. #Ethereum Spot ETF flows have remained positive for the 8th consecutive week, with net inflows topping 61,000 $ETH pic.twitter.com/aTANkr4RCy — glassnode (@glassnode) July 7, 2025 The crypto market overall has seen a notable increase over the past 24 hours. One of the positive factors is the regulatory support for the industry in the US, as the country works towards forming a crypto market structure regulation. “Make no mistake: blockchain technology and digital assets are not going away – they are here to stay,” said US Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott during the first full committee hearing on digital assets on 9 July. Moreover, the US Federal Reserve decided to keep the federal funds rate steady , per the June minutes released on 9 July, as “tariffs pose a persistent risk for driving up prices.” However, many believe that a rate cut will happen this year if inflationary pressures ease. And interest rate cuts are typically favorable for crypto assets. Meanwhile, Ethereum is currently trading at $2,776. It’s up 5.5% in a day and 7% in a week. It’s unchanged in a month and down 10.5% in a year. It started the day with the intraday high of $2,869 and then plunged to $2,182, before gradually climbing back to the current level.

He now says Bitcoin will reach $220,000 by the end of 2025 . This isn’t a new number for Keiser. He’s been calling for it for over a decade. But for the first time, he’s attached a deadline. That alone has caught the market’s attention especially now, as Bitcoin rallies into open territory with no clear resistance ahead. Keiser’s Countdown Begins Bitcoin is currently trading around $110,955. A move to $220,000 would mean doubling from here, which might seem aggressive. But looking at past bull runs, it’s not out of the question. $220,000 in 2025 pic.twitter.com/IzduBPm0YG — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) July 10, 2025 Keiser has supported Bitcoin since it was trading under $5. Through crashes, hype cycles, and regulatory pressure, he never backed down. His consistency has kept him relevant, especially now as the price breaks into new highs with serious momentum behind it. The 2025 Countdown Begins Now that Keiser has put a date on his $220K forecast, the clock is officially ticking. His timeline adds a sense of urgency just as optimism returns to the market, helped along by President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance , which has reignited confidence among both retail and institutional players. With regulatory clarity improving and inflows rising, the setup feels right. Whether Bitcoin hits $220,000 or not, Keiser’s bold call has given the market a target and a new narrative. Bitcoin’s Breakout: No Resistance Ahead ! Bitcoin’s clean break above $112,000 signals a move into clear air, with no overhead price resistance or historical supply zones. Keiser’s target fits neatly with current trends. As institutional adoption gains pace and sentiment turns bullish, his prediction is less of a wild guess and more of a bet on momentum, macro shifts, and growing acceptance of crypto as a serious asset class. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Expert Peter Brandt Warns Bitcoin Rally Is At Risk – Here’s Why , Crypto Twitter Chimes In On X, responses poured in, some supportive, others skeptical.

2025-07-10T13:02:44,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Trump Family Quietly Expands Crypto Holdings – Big Announcement Soon?","Bitcoin is up early Thursday, pushing towards $111,713 on a wave of bullishness. A 1.82% 24-hour gain and $62 billion in volume indicate deepening confidence in digital assets, particularly as high-profile figures like the Trump family double down on crypto investments. Now, just below $111,000, Bitcoin’s recent momentum is drawing attention from both institutional and retail players. Bitcoin just ripped +2.7% out of a textbook triangle breakout. Measured move target hit to the dollar at $112K. RSI at 78. Bulls are in full control. Next resistance at $112.8K and $113.4K. Breakout traders are winning this round. #BTC #Bitcoin #Crypto pic.twitter.com/m9xJChlU4f — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) July 9, 2025 One of the significant catalysts? A new $4 million investment in Thumzup Media by Donald Trump Jr. demonstrates that the Trump camp remains interested in expanding its crypto exposure. Meanwhile, corporate Bitcoin holdings are at all-time highs, indicating a shift in long-term strategy among public companies. Trump Family’s Growing Crypto Footprint Donald Trump Jr’s investment in Thumzup Media, a corporate Bitcoin holder, is a big deal for the family’s growing crypto portfolio . Thumzup, which started accumulating BTC in January 2025, is now diversifying into altcoins, including Ethereum, Solana, Dogecoin, and XRP. JUST IN: Donald Trump Jr. bought 350,000 shares of Thumzup Media, which holds $2 million in $BTC and plans to add 6 more cryptocurrencies as part of the family’s crypto treasury strategy. pic.twitter.com/E4wIx5tSha — crypto.news (@cryptodotnews) July 10, 2025 This is in addition to earlier Trump-backed initiatives, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, as well as a multi-coin index product launched through Trump Media. While Thumzup’s balanced asset approach may not have an immediate impact on Bitcoin prices, the bigger picture is clear: the Trump family is committed to crypto in the long term. Trump Jr invests $4M in Thumzup Media Thumzup adds ETH, LTC, DOGE, XRP, USDC Crypto is a central part of the Trump business strategy These moves reinforce the narrative that digital assets are becoming part of both political and corporate America. Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Hit New Highs While individual headlines get the attention, the real structural change is coming from the boardroom. Corporate Bitcoin holdings surged 23% in Q2 2025, with 159,107 BTC added, valued at $17.6 billion. That brings total institutional holdings to 847,000 BTC or 4% of Bitcoin’s supply. The number of public companies holding BTC also increased significantly. 46 new firms were added to the list, bringing the total to 125, a 58% quarterly gain. Notable names include: Strategy (Michael Saylor): 597,325 BTC MARA Holdings, Twenty One, Metaplanet GameStop and Trump Media are looking to raise $2.5B for BTC buys Institutional interest is no longer passive—it’s strategic, aggressive, and long-term accumulation. Bitcoin Bullish Breakout Above $111K From a technical standpoint, Bitcoin’s breakout from the symmetrical triangle is confirmed. The price has broken above the descending resistance and reclaimed the 50-SMA on the 2-hour chart at $109,200, accompanied by increased volume. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Now Bitcoin is consolidating just below $112,012 resistance, printing small-bodied candles—a classic bullish continuation. The RSI is at 64.3, indicating room to run before overbought levels are reached. No divergence is present. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Trade Setup Entry: Break and close above $112,012 Targets: $112,897 and $113,772 Stop-loss: Below $110,638 If the price retests $110,638 and forms a hammer or a bullish engulfing candle, that could be a lower-risk re-entry point. Conclusion: The Trump family’s renewed interest and record institutional accumulation are giving Bitcoin a strong narrative and technical tailwind. With price structure intact and RSI in favor of bull,s a push to $113,772 looks likely if $112K is broken with volume. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Over $2M as Price Rise Nears Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), has raised over $2 million in its public presale, with $2,261,067 out of a $2,637,961 target.

The crypto is continuing its strong uptrend after validating the breakout from a bullish pattern that has formed around $110,000. The price structure remains bullish, supported by previous retests and multiple continuation flags throughout the rally. Currently, the BTC price is now pressing just beneath the upper channel resistance, targeting a potential extension toward the $117,000 to $120,000. The positive price action of Bitcoin is reflected across the broader crypto market, with altcoins also experiencing gains. The crypto fear & greed index hovers in the neutral zone but is close to entering, ‘Greed’ zone, indicating strong bullish sentiment. Besides, institutional demand, particularly from spot Bitcoin ETFs, remains a key driver. Additionally, the recent U.S.macroeconomic data, including a cooling inflation rate and anticipation of potential interest rate cuts, has created a favorable backdrop for risk assets, including Bitcoin. Now the question arises, how high can the BTC price go in 2025? The latest price action of Bitcoin appears to be extremely bullish, suggesting that the bulls have maintained a strong grip on the rally. Connecting the highs, the next crucial resistance to surpass is $112,917.33, which may trigger a strong rally in the coming days. The supertrend has turned bullish with the latest breakout, hinting towards the beginning of a strong bullish trend. On the other hand, RSI is forming consecutive higher highs and lows and eventually pushes the levels towards the upper threshold. Therefore, the Bitcoin (BTC) price appears to be strongly within a bullish trajectory and hence is expected to maintain a strong ascending trend. However, the price is believed to consolidate for a while but eventually remains within a bullish influence.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-maintains-momentum-after-breaking-highs-new-ath-incoming/,"TRADING|BTC|MARKET|ALTCOIN","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

Recent 1INCH News/Opinions The 1inch team investment fund recently withdrew 5.01 million 1INCH tokens from Binance, drawing attention in the DeFi space. Highlighted by @EmberCN, this is part of a long-term accumulation strategy. The fund also bought 1.757 million USDC worth of 1INCH and deposited 975,000 USDT to Binance. Since February, it has accumulated 24.86 million 1INCH at an average of $0.20 each, totaling around $4.98 million, signaling a bullish outlook. 1inch Price Prediction August 2025 1inch price triggered a bullish rally over the last few days as Bitcoin price aimed for a rally above $110K. However, as the market has now cooled down, the price of 1INCH is facing a surge in bearish dominance from short term holders. However, if the altcoin market cap gains momentum in August following Bitcoin’s surge above $110K, we might see a robust comeback in the 1INCH price. As a result, it is anticipated that the 1inch Network will have a minimum price of $0.19 in August. The maximum price level could hit $0.32, with an expected average price of $0.26 throughout the month. 1inch Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 1inch Price Prediction August 2025 $0.19 $0.26 $0.32 1inch Price Prediction 2025 Historically, the full impact of a Bitcoin Halving isn’t felt until about a year to a year and a half afterward.

The year 2022 proved challenging for cryptocurrencies, including 1INCH, which fell below one dollar in May and ended the year at $0.384 after a series of market crashes—marking a decline of over 80%. In 2023, 1INCH had a mixed year; it experienced a high of $0.6896 in a robust market, but struggled significantly after the U.S. SEC announced lawsuits against major crypto exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. This news led to a new low of $0.2535 on June 15. A brief spike occurred on July 17, pushing the price up to $0.5811, mainly fueled by buzz on the Upbit exchange, but this was followed by another fall to $0.2211 on September 11. The token managed a slight recovery to $0.254 by October 19, 2023, and eventually closed the year at $0.4265, marking a 10% annual increase, which seems modest compared to the overall crypto market’s doubling in the same period. 1INCH price declined heavily in April and touched below $0.4. After touching the lows of $0.22 in November, the price of 1INCH rebounded strongly from the bearish trend utility In December, the price of 1inch surged to a high of $0.63; however, it declined later and ended the year at $0.38. 1INCH began trading in 2025 on a bearish note. By the end of Q1, it declined below $0.15. In recent months of Q2 and Q3 of 2025, 1INCH has been trading around $0.2.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/1inch-price-prediction/,"TRADING|1INCH|ICO|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BTC","Crypto Price Predictions",cryptocompare
2025-07-10T13:00:00,"Cardano Foundation Increased Spending on Core Areas by 15% Last Year","Cardano Foundation, a not-for-profit organization that develops and supports the Cardano network, said it spent $22.1 million on its three core areas last year, a 15% increase from 2023. The money was allocated to adoption, operational resilience and education, according to the report, which is available to view on-chain via the Cardano Foundation's Reeve tool . That's up from $19.22 million the year before . Assets rose to $659.1 million worth of crypto from $478.24 million as crypto prices rose. The price of bitcoin (BTC), which now accounts for about 15% of its holdings, climbed about 120% in 2024 while ADA (ADA) added 42%. ADA's share of of assets dropped to 77% from 83%, according to the report. ""The Foundation’s primary income stream comes from staking rewards, which in 2024 totalled 17.1 million ADA from its 599.2 million ADA holdings—a return of 2.7%,"" the company said. ""Importantly, the delegation strategy prioritises stake pools that contribute meaningfully to the ecosystem, reinforcing the Foundation’s role as a responsible participant in Cardano’s decentralized infrastructure."" In 2024, the foundation allocated over half of its expenditure — $15 million — toward adoption initiatives. These efforts included collaborations with organizations such as NASA, Barcelona FC, and the United Nations Development Programme, aiming to expand Cardano's real-world applications. Operational resilience received $3.8 million, funding enhancements like the launch of an open-source Cardano.org platform and the introduction of the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol, which connects Cardano to over 115 blockchains.

2025-07-10T12:55:43,"Bitcoin Could Hit $133K as Traders Remain Underexposed, Says 10x Research","Crypto investors may be underexposed to Bitcoin upside, even as option traders grow increasingly bullish, according to 10x Research head Markus Thielen. The analyst noted that many traders remain underpositioned after last month’s options expiry, leaving room for a potential rally that could see BTC climb to $133,000 by September. “Traders are now predominantly buying calls, signaling they may be underexposed to further upside,” Thielen said in a same-day market report. He added that with Bitcoin clocking a new all-time high at $112,000, the market could see momentum build further in the coming months. Bitcoin Trend Turns Bullish Amid ETF Demand 10x Research’s proprietary Bitcoin trend model flipped bullish on June 29, according to Thielen, indicating the current breakout may carry a 60% probability of further upside over the next two months. Historical patterns suggest this could translate to gains of around 20%, placing BTC near $133,000 from its current levels near $111,000. “This implies Bitcoin may be transitioning into a higher trading range,” Thielen explained, adding that several catalysts could fuel additional gains. These include the upcoming US Consumer Price Index (CPI) print on July 15, which is expected to be “benign,” and a “bullish policy backdrop” anticipated during the US crypto week. Thielen emphasized that despite Q3 traditionally being BTC’s weakest quarter—averaging just a 5.84% return since 2013—this time may differ, with ETF inflows and policy developments acting as tailwinds. On Wednesday alone, US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs posted $215.7 million in net inflows, according to data from Farside. “Bitcoin is breaking out, fueled by relentless ETF demand and a series of policy catalysts on the horizon,” Thielen said, cautioning that traders on the sidelines “risk missing the move that could define this quarter.” Analysts Signal a Shift in Market Sentiment Thielen’s outlook aligns with other crypto analysts who have highlighted growing optimism in the crypto market. Crypto trader Jelle stated on X, “Bitcoin is taking off,” expressing hope for a price close that confirms bullish momentum and silences bearish arguments. Rekt Capital echoed the sentiment, declaring, “The Bitcoin downtrend is over.” Meanwhile, crypto analyst Matthew Hyland warned that “max pain is coming” for those sitting out the current rally, comparing the present market environment to missed buying opportunities seen during the 2020 cycle. As BTC gains traction and policy developments align , the next few months could prove critical for traders evaluating their exposure. Analysts are suggesting that the cryptocurrency’s breakout could define the narrative for the remainder of Q3.

This new record also increases the expectation of a rise in Bitcoin, with Milk Road co-founder Kyle Reidhead predicting that Bitcoin could reach $150,000. What's the Next Target for Bitcoin? At this point, Kyle Reidhead, in an X post, stated that there is a “bullish cup and handle” formation in Bitcoin that he thinks will push the price up, and said, “See you at $150,000.” The cup and handle formation, which the analyst predicts will carry BTC to $150,000, is interpreted as a signal of an uptrend, which will pause for consolidation and sideways movement, then continue to rise. Analyst CryptoBusy also noted a bullish flag formation on Bitcoin's 4-hour chart, stating that a close above $112,000 could lead to a rise reaching $120,000 in the short term. Cryptocurrency analyst Matthew Hyland also stated that Bitcoin could continue its rise, saying that from a technical perspective, Bitcoin has broken out of its recent downtrend. “Bitcoin confirms its daily rally and confirms the end of the downtrend that began in late May. “The bulls are in control” eToro analyst Josh Gilbert also spoke after the rally, noting that the recent rally was institutionally driven, saying, “This is the first true bull market where institutional participation is at the forefront. Strong ETF inflows and a solid macroeconomic backdrop have helped fuel market momentum, but perhaps the most important change is who is buying.” Coinstash co-founder Mena Theodorou offered a similar view to Josh Gilbert, saying, “It's clear this rally is driven by institutions, not retail investors.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-10T12:46:52,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Sky Is The Limit As BTC Surges To New All-Time High","Bitcoin (BTC) soared to a new all-time high on Wednesday, crossing $112,000 on Coinbase before retreating and settling at $111,255. The flagship cryptocurrency’s rally was supported by strong institutional support, as traders threw caution to the wind and ignored tariff tensions. BTC and the broader market’s sharp rally saw over 114,000 traders liquidated, with a majority of losses due to short positions. Bitcoin (BTC) Soars To New All-Time High Bitcoin (BTC) rallied to a new all-time high, moving past $112,000 on Coinbase, as it hit record levels. The flagship cryptocurrency briefly crossed $112,000 on Wednesday, reaching $112,055 before retreating and settling at $111,255. The previous high on Coinbase was $111,891, set back in May. The flagship cryptocurrency surged on Wednesday after investors liquidated over $280 million in short positions, according to data from Coinglass. Strahinja Savic, head of data analytics at FRNT Financial, stated, “For the asset's proponents, the global situation is exactly why they would have bought the asset in the first place. In the U.S., there is growing awareness that the fiscal situation is unsustainable and that the country lacks the capacity for reform.” BTC is up around 20% year-to-date despite trading between $100,000 and $110,000 as investors remained cautious about trade tariffs, a hawkish Fed, and macroeconomic uncertainties. “Beyond the U.S., there is no shortage of geopolitical and macro anxieties, from the Russia-Ukraine war to Middle East hostilities.” Did Nvidia Surge Propel Bitcoin (BTC) Past $112,000? Bitcoin (BTC) soared past $112,000 on Wednesday as an Nvidia-led rally pushed the flagship cryptocurrency to record levels. BTC has been trading in a range for weeks, despite billions flowing into spot Bitcoin ETFs. The stock market rallied on Wednesday after Nvidia became the first company to reach $4 trillion in market capitalization, albeit briefly. Investors also ignored negative sentiment around tariffs, creating a risk-on environment in the market. Institutions have embraced Bitcoin’s “digital gold” narrative. However, it remains a risky asset, rising and falling alongside the traditional markets. When markets are in risk-on mode and investors buy assets like tech stocks, BTC , and the broader crypto market rallies. Investors and analysts expect Bitcoin to reach new highs in the latter half of 2025 as corporate treasuries buy Bitcoin and the US gets closer to crypto legislation being passed in Congress. Ryan Gorman, chief strategy officer at Uranium Digital, predicted further bullishness, stating, “With crypto week on the horizon next week in DC, and a likely flood of positive momentum heading into the dog days of summer, bullish sentiment and thinner trading volumes could see prices gap up to $120,000 or higher by the end of next week. How far we rally through the summer is anyone’s guess, but open call interest outweighs puts, which normally reveals traders are bullish and expect upward price momentum to continue.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) re-entered price discovery mode on Wednesday after racing past $112,000. The flagship cryptocurrency started the week in the red, dropping nearly 1% on Monday. It recovered on Tuesday, rising 0.62% to $108,942. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as the price rallied past $112,000 before registering a marginal decline during the ongoing session. BTC's latest rally has unleashed a wave of optimism among analysts and investors, with Milk Road co-founder Kyle Reidhead believing a move to $150,000 is imminent. He highlighted a bullish “cup and handle” formation that could push the price to this level. The market optimism comes after weeks of consolidation, which raised concerns about BTC’s ability to surpass May’s record highs. The rally couldn’t have come at a better time for BTC . Just hours before its rally, an analyst stated that if the flagship cryptocurrency does not reach a new high within the next two weeks, it would have to wait till October to test these levels again. Market sentiment has picked up as well, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index posting a “Greed” score of 71 out of 100. According to analyst Matthew Hyland, Bitcoin has broken out of its recent downtrend. Hyland stated, “ BTC confirms daily higher-high and confirms an end to the downtrend that started in late May.” Others, like eToro analyst Josh Gilbert, believe this is the first bull market that has clear institutional participation. “This is the first real bull market where institutional participation is front and center.” BTC ended the previous weekend in positive territory, rising nearly 1% on Sunday (June 29) and settling at $108,350. The price was back in the red on Monday, dropping 1.09% to $107,168. Selling pressure intensified on Tuesday as BTC fell 1.33%, slipping below $106,000 to $105,740.

2025-07-10T12:45:25,"BTC Crushed Tech Stocks—But Smart Money Eyes AI Coins Like AGNT","Bitcoin has beaten many tech stocks lately, sparking interest among savvy investors. Yet, the attention is shifting to AI-focused cryptocurrencies. Coins like NEAR and AGNT are catching the eyes of investors looking for the next big opportunity. Meanwhile, an exciting project, Codename:Pepe crypto, is mixing humor with profits. Inspired by the success of PEPE coin, it offers members access to unique strategies and analytics. This initiative could shake up the AI coin landscape, providing a fresh path for traders. Codename:Pepe (AGNT) Gains Traction After Listing and Supply Burn, Eyes $2.1 Milestone Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) has recently made its entrance on Uniswap, opening the floodgates for global trading — and it didn’t come quietly. In a dramatic power move, Codename:Pepe has burned a significant portion of the tokens to tighten the supply and send a clear message: this project plays to win. $AGNT token burns mean reducing the supply and boosting scarcity, which may fuel a price surge.

Automated Trading: The AI engine will be able to execute real-time trades, turning noise into signals and volatility into opportunity. DAO Utility: Token holders will gain exclusive access to insider analytics and community voting through the AGNT DAO. Momentum is building: the presale sold out early. Now with liquidity, community energy, and a shrinking supply, AGNT is poised to move. Codename:Pepe fuses cutting-edge AI with meme market psychology, and it’s already showing signs of breakout potential. With the supply burn and Uniswap launch, AGNT is now positioned to lead the next wave of meme coin dominance. Price Is Rising. Supply Is Shrinking. Buy $AGNT Now Bitcoin's Journey: From Genesis to 2025 and Beyond Bitcoin, the world's first cryptocurrency, was created in 2009 by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto. It operates without a central authority, allowing people to send money directly to each other. Instead of physical coins, Bitcoin uses a shared digital ledger called the blockchain. The blockchain is maintained by many computers around the world, known as nodes. When someone wants to send Bitcoin, their transaction is verified by the network through a process called mining. This ensures that everyone agrees on who owns what, keeping the system secure and transparent. Over the years, Bitcoin's value has seen significant ups and downs. By 2025, it has continued to grow in popularity and adoption. Major companies and even some governments have shown interest, contributing to its increased demand. Many analysts predict that Bitcoin's price could reach new heights in the coming years. Some forecasts suggest it could rise to over $100,000 or even higher by 2030. These predictions are based on factors like limited supply, growing acceptance, and technological advancements. While past performance doesn't guarantee future results, Bitcoin's potential remains a topic of interest. As we look beyond 2025, its influence on the financial world could continue to expand, making it a noteworthy asset in the evolving digital economy. NEAR's Surge in 2025: Will Near Protocol Shape the Future of Crypto? Near Protocol saw massive growth in 2023, with its users increasing tenfold. In November, it launched NEAT inscriptions, similar to NFTs, attracting many to the network. About a year ago, Near partnered with Alibaba Cloud, potentially reaching nearly a billion customers. Though its value dropped afterward, it started recovering in October and November. This upsurge was partly due to KAIKAINOW, a platform that lets people access content without unlocking their phones. This innovation boosted interest in Near Protocol. By late 2024, NEAR's price climbed from under $4 to over $5. Predictions suggest it could reach $8.21 in 2025, $10.50 in 2026, and up to $20 by 2030. Near Protocol aims to be faster and more user-friendly than other blockchains. With human-readable addresses and quick validation, it supports decentralized apps. Given its technology and growth, NEAR looks promising in the current market cycle. Conclusion In summary, while established cryptocurrencies like BTC and NEAR have demonstrated significant growth, their short-term potential may be modest compared to emerging AI-driven projects. Innovations such as Codename:Pepe crypto are leveraging true intelligence to navigate the volatile meme coin market, aiming to offer unique opportunities amidst the chaos. As the crypto landscape evolves, attention is shifting toward assets that combine advanced technology with community engagement. Codename:Pepe crypto distinguishes itself by integrating artificial intelligence for market analysis and automated trading, providing members with exclusive insights and strategies. This approach positions it as a notable contender among new AI-focused cryptocurrencies.

2025-07-10T12:40:29,"Bitcoin ETFs Achieve Monumental $50 Billion Inflows: A Game-Changer for Crypto Investment","The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with a truly remarkable achievement: U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have not just arrived, they’ve absolutely exploded, topping an astounding $50 billion in net inflows within just 18 months of their launch. This isn’t just a number; it’s a clear signal of growing mainstream acceptance and institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. For years, the crypto community yearned for accessible, regulated investment vehicles, and now, the data speaks volumes about their impact. Unpacking the Phenomenal Growth of US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Since their eagerly anticipated debut in January 2024, U.S. spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs have rapidly become a cornerstone of the financial landscape, attracting an unprecedented volume of capital. According to Cointelegraph, citing data from Farside Investors, these investment vehicles have collectively surpassed the $50 billion mark in net inflows in a remarkably short period. This rapid accumulation of assets underscores a significant shift in how traditional investors are engaging with digital assets. A Spot Bitcoin ETF offers investors direct exposure to the price movements of Bitcoin without requiring them to directly buy, store, or manage the underlying cryptocurrency. This simplicity, combined with the regulatory oversight of traditional financial markets, has proven to be an irresistible combination for a wide range of investors, from individual retail participants to large institutional players. Key Players and Their Performance The race for market share among these new funds has been intense, with some clear leaders emerging. Here’s a snapshot of the top performers and their contribution to this monumental inflow: Fund Net Inflows/Outflows (Approx.) Key Highlight BlackRock’s IBIT +$53 billion The undisputed leader, showcasing massive institutional demand. Fidelity’s FBTC +$12.29 billion Strong performance, cementing its position as a major contender. Grayscale’s GBTC -$23.34 billion Experienced outflows due to its conversion from a trust, but remains a significant player. BlackRock’s IBIT has been a standout performer, leading the pack with an astonishing $53 billion in inflows. This dominance highlights the immense trust and capital that institutional investors are channeling through established financial giants. Fidelity’s FBTC has also demonstrated robust performance, securing over $12 billion in inflows and reinforcing the widespread appeal of these regulated products. Grayscale’s GBTC, while showing significant outflows, presents a unique case. Its conversion from a closed-end trust to an ETF allowed investors who were previously locked in to redeem their shares, leading to profit-taking and arbitrage opportunities. Despite these outflows, GBTC remains a crucial part of the ecosystem, representing a foundational piece of the original institutional interest in Bitcoin. Why Are BTC ETFs Attracting So Much Capital? The question on many Bitcoin ETFsminds is, what makes these BTC ETFs so incredibly attractive? Several factors contribute to their magnetic appeal, drawing in capital at an unprecedented rate: Accessibility: For traditional investors, purchasing Bitcoin directly can be complex. ETFs simplify this process, allowing them to gain exposure through familiar brokerage accounts, just like buying stocks or mutual funds. Regulatory Clarity: The approval of these ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provided a stamp of legitimacy that the crypto market desperately sought. This regulatory green light offers a sense of security and compliance that was previously missing. Institutional Trust: The involvement of established financial institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, and others lends immense credibility. These firms bring decades of experience in managing large pools of capital and adhering to stringent regulatory standards, reassuring cautious investors. Liquidity: ETFs are highly liquid, meaning they can be easily bought and sold throughout the trading day, offering flexibility that direct crypto purchases might not always provide. Diversification: For portfolio managers, Bitcoin ETFs offer a new avenue for diversification, allowing them to allocate a portion of their assets to a high-growth, uncorrelated asset class within a regulated framework. The Broader Impact: What Does This Mean for Crypto Investment? The success of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs is more than just a financial milestone; it represents a profound shift in the perception and future trajectory of crypto investment . This influx of capital from traditional finance has several far-reaching implications: Mainstream Legitimacy: The $50 billion inflow firmly cements Bitcoin’s status as a legitimate, investable asset class in the eyes of mainstream finance. This moves Bitcoin beyond niche speculation into the realm of serious portfolio consideration. Increased Market Stability: As more institutional money enters the market through regulated products, it could potentially lead to greater market stability and reduced volatility over the long term, as these investors tend to have longer holding periods. New Investor Demographics: The ETFs have opened the floodgates for a new wave of investors who previously shied away from the perceived complexities or risks of direct crypto ownership. This broadens the investor base significantly. Catalyst for Other Crypto Products: The success of Bitcoin ETFs is likely to pave the way for similar products tracking other major cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum ETFs, further integrating digital assets into traditional finance. This massive adoption signifies a turning point, transforming Bitcoin from a fringe asset into a recognized financial instrument that institutions and individuals can confidently access. Navigating the Future: Actionable Insights for Institutional Adoption The rapid rise of spot Bitcoin ETFs provides valuable insights and potential pathways for future institutional adoption within the digital asset space. For investors and market participants, understanding these dynamics is crucial: For Investors: Consider the long-term strategic allocation. While Bitcoin is volatile, its inclusion in diversified portfolios via ETFs offers a managed approach to exposure. Research different funds, their fees, and underlying structures to align with your investment goals. For Financial Advisors: Educate clients on the benefits and risks of Bitcoin ETFs. These products provide a regulated entry point for clients interested in digital assets without the complexities of direct crypto ownership. For Crypto Projects: The success of Bitcoin ETFs highlights the demand for regulated, accessible products. This could inspire the development of similar instruments for other digital assets, driving further innovation and legitimization. Regulatory Evolution: The SEC’s approval of Bitcoin ETFs signals a maturing regulatory environment. Expect continued dialogue and potential frameworks for other digital asset classes, which could unlock even more institutional capital. The journey has just begun, but the initial data clearly indicates a powerful trend towards integrating digital assets into the global financial system through regulated, accessible channels. A New Era of Digital Asset Investment The astounding $50 billion in net inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs within just 18 months is more than a headline; it’s a testament to a seismic shift in the financial world. It validates Bitcoin’s growing acceptance as a mainstream asset, driven by robust institutional interest and enhanced accessibility for all types of investors. This milestone marks a new era where digital assets are increasingly integrated into traditional financial portfolios, promising further innovation and growth in the years to come.

After weeks of sideways action and uncertainty, this move marks a small but significant breakout, reigniting bullish sentiment among investors and traders. The breakout comes as Bitcoin continues to consolidate below its all-time highs, allowing ETH and other altcoins to take the lead. Related Reading: Bitcoin 30-Day Average Funding Rate Drops – Bullish Setup Takes Shape Market participants are closely watching Ethereum’s price action, as its movements often set the tone for the broader altcoin space. Top analyst Ted Pillows shared a technical view highlighting that ETH is once again trading at the top of its recent range. A breakout above this level could confirm the beginning of a larger expansion phase for altcoins. With bullish momentum building and Ethereum holding strong above reclaimed support levels, traders are becoming increasingly confident that the altcoin market may be on the verge of a broader breakout. However, key resistance still lies ahead, and the next few days will be crucial in determining whether Ethereum has the strength to continue higher and lead a new leg up in the crypto cycle. Ethereum Trades at Range Highs: Breakout Looms Ethereum has spent the past several weeks consolidating in a well-defined range between approximately $2,400 and $2,800, a structure that began forming in early May. Despite short-term volatility, ETH has held key support levels, suggesting that bulls remain in control. Now, with price action pushing toward the upper boundary of the range once again, the market is watching closely to see whether Ethereum can break through resistance and initiate a sustained rally. The broader macroeconomic backdrop has shifted in favor of risk assets. In the US, strong labor market data and wage growth have helped ease concerns of an economic slowdown. Meanwhile, the resolution of several global geopolitical tensions has reduced uncertainty, allowing markets to stabilize. This supportive environment could give Ethereum the fuel it needs to attempt a breakout. Ted Pillows recently highlighted that Ethereum is now trading at the range highs again — a level that has repeatedly capped price advances in recent months. According to Pillow, a confirmed breakout above the $2,800 resistance would likely trigger renewed momentum for ETH and potentially spark a broader move across the altcoin market. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Action Signals Momentum Shift: BTC Sleeps And ETH Moves $2,800 Resistance Now In Sight Ethereum is showing renewed strength as it breaks out of a multi-week consolidation range, with the latest 12-hour candle closing above $2,760. The price action has decisively reclaimed the $2,700 level and is now testing the critical $2,800 resistance zone. This breakout is supported by a clear surge in volume, confirming bullish momentum. The 50, 100, and 200-period moving averages are all trending upwards and currently sit well below the current price, a strong technical sign of sustained momentum. ETH has moved above all three key SMAs, confirming that bulls are in control in the short to medium term. Notably, this is the highest ETH has traded since early June, and the candle structure resembles a classic continuation breakout setup. Related Reading: ERC-20 Stablecoin Supply Hits All-Time High At $121B – Liquidity On The Rise A successful daily close above $2,800 would open the door for an expansion toward the $3,000 level and potentially higher if momentum holds.

If ETH can hold above $2,700 and build support, the breakout could serve as a launchpad for altcoins, especially as Ethereum often leads broader market moves.

2025-07-10T12:16:44,"Nvidia Hits $4 Trillion—Does Bitcoin Still Follow Tech’s Lead?","Nvidia's record-breaking ascent to a $4 trillion market cap has once again fueled debate around the shifting dynamics between Big Tech and Bitcoin. As the stock of the AI chipmaker rose to record highs, traders and analysts are parsing whether Bitcoin is once more riding tech tailwinds—or crypto is finally going solo. Nvidia's shares hit an all-time high of $164.32, temporarily becoming the world's first $4 trillion company. The rally has been fueled by insatiable demand for AI chips, with investors seeing Nvidia as the bedrock of the artificial intelligence revolution that is now unfolding. The company's valuation is the same as the GDP of the world's most significant economies, showing the scale of the AI boom. Bitcoin and Nvidia: Correlation Data Tells a Nuanced Story For the majority of 2024 and the beginning of 2025, Bitcoin and Nvidia moved together, having correlation factors as high as 0.80 or higher—a very unusual level between disparate sectors' assets. This tight linkage reflected a broader ”risk-on” environment in which money entered crypto and AI stocks as proxies for growth and innovation. But newer figures show that the correlation is starting to weaken. While the three-month average remains reasonably healthy at 0.69, the newer figures have dropped back to around 0.36, indicating decoupling as investor interest waxes elsewhere. Of interest is the fact that Bitcoin's new all-time high of over $111,900 occurred roughly around the time of Nvidia's $4T mark, but analysts caution that this may be indicative of overall market euphoria and not a sustained trend. 2023-2024: Rolling 90-day correlation between BTC and NVDA was between 0.45-0.6, indicating moderate positive correlation. Q2 2025: Correlation has fallen below 0.3, with some weeks of near-zero or even negative readings, as Bitcoin lagged despite Nvidia moving relentlessly upwards. “Nvidia’s rally to $4 trillion might have helped BTC, but correlation is waning as macro factors and crypto-specific catalysts take over,” notes a leading digital asset strategist. The changing relationship between Nvidia and Bitcoin reflects diverging market drivers. Nvidia’s surge is powered by relentless AI demand and enterprise tech investment, while Bitcoin’s price action is increasingly shaped by macroeconomic uncertainty and crypto-specific events. As AI stocks become crowded trades, investors are rotating funds, but Bitcoin is now moving more on its own fundamentals—like halving cycles and regulatory news—than on Big Tech momentum. This marks a clear shift: Bitcoin is decoupling from the tech rally and forging an independent path. AI Chip Supply Chains: Indirect Impact on Crypto Mining Nvidia's leadership in AI chips' market share has spill-over benefits across the digital asset world, especially across crypto mining: ASIC Supply Chain Restriction: With demand for AI surging, semiconductor manufacturing facilities like TSMC and Samsung are prioritizing orders for AI chips, restricting supply chains for Bitcoin mining devices. This can lead to increased costs and longer lead times for ASIC miners, restricting profitability. Geopolitical Shifts: Tariffs and trade tensions are leading top ASIC manufacturers to set up production in the US, reshaping the global mining supply chain and even driving up miner expenses. AI-Blockchain Convergence: Mining operators are utilizing AI-driven analytics to optimize operations and supply chains, with blockchain offering transparency and traceability of hardware origins. Nvidia's $4T milestone is a testiment to the robustness of the AI bubble, but the era of Bitcoin keeping pace with Big Tech is likely behind us. As macro dynamics and crypto-native forces come into relief, investors must look for a less overt and more uncertain alignment between the world's leading AI chipmaker and the digital currency monarch.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9886/nvidia-hits-4-trillion-does-bitcoin-still-follow-tech-s-lead,"BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|MARKET|TRADING","News|Business",cryptocompare
2025-07-10T12:15:20,"Bitcoin traders race to reset expectations after surge to new all-time high","Bitcoin’s price movement to a new all-time high of $112,052 on Wednesday has made some investors re-evaluate their positions, with analysts warning that underexposed traders could be caught off guard if the rally continues. 10x Research analysts believe Bitcoin’s latest breakout could extend deep into the third quarter, reaching a price target of as high as $133,000. According to Markus Thielen, head of research at 10x Research, the firm’s Bitcoin trend model flipped bullish on June 29. The model now places a 60% probability of BTC continuing its upward market price move over the next two months. Thielen’s analysis mentions a potential 20% gain during this period, which would see Bitcoin tread upwards to $130,000 at current prices. “Bitcoin is breaking out, fueled by relentless ETF demand and a series of policy catalysts on the horizon,” Thielen wrote in a market update released Wednesday. He reiterated that many traders are underpositioned following the previous month’s option expiry, leading to a “significant exposure roll-off.” “We remain constructive,” he jotted down, explaining that current trading signals support the continuation of this bullish trend. Call option buying: Traders eyeing an upside move According to the 10x Research head, Bitcoin traders are now predominantly buying calls, which could mean there is a sentiment of being “underexposed to further upside.” Market participants may be racing to catch up with Bitcoin’s rally rather than driving it through spot buying. He also explained that the current market bull run will likely extend into September, especially if upcoming macroeconomic events become favorable. Bitcoin ETF flows – $15 billion net buying since mid-April. Source: 10xResearch In the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report scheduled for release on July 15, economists expect a “benign” CPI print to push people towards buying positions. The third quarter hasn’t always been Bitcoin’s most favorable time of the year, with an average return of just 5.84% since 2013, according to data from CoinGlass. Still, Thielen is confident this year could be an exception, citing US pro-crypto policy changes and green ETF flows. “Traders on the sidelines risk missing the move that could define this quarter,” he concluded. ETF inflows show bulls in control Even during weeks of consolidation, there was approximately $15 billion in silent accumulation through the US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs . On Wednesday alone, these ETFs attracted $215.7 million in inflows, according to data from Farside Investors. Traders previously sitting on the sidelines are seemingly being forced to re-enter the market, potentially at much higher prices. 10x Research revealed that it has entered a long position in Bitcoin at $104,000, hedged with a $115,000 call option. The core position is up by $7,000, but the option has only gained $450 because of the market’s reduced implied volatility and time decay. Still, Thielen said the trade was performing as expected and will soon transition into a higher trading range. Ethereum ETFs on a market run Ethereum surged over 5% on Wednesday, outperforming Bitcoin, Ripple, and Solana. The rally was accompanied by record trading activity in BlackRock’s spot ether ETF, ETHA, listed on Nasdaq. More than 43 million shares of ETHA changed hands on Wednesday, the highest daily volume since the fund’s debut a year ago. According to Yahoo Finance, that figure nearly doubled the previous day’s volume of 24 million. TradingView data also shows that ETHA’s 30-day average trading volume is up by 18.83 million shares, up from 12.97 million in the first week of June. Investor interest has translated into robust capital inflows, with over $1.2 billion added to the fund since June. On Tuesday alone, net inflows reached $159 million, the largest single-day total since June 11, based on SoSoValue data. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-07-10T12:13:40,"WIF Price Jumps 13% as Meme Coins Rally","TL;DR WIF confirms cup-and-handle breakout, pushing toward resistance at $1.031 with strong momentum. Volume and open interest surged, signaling aggressive long positions and growing trader confidence. The Fibonacci zone between $0.8550–$0.8776 forms a new demand zone for a possible retest and support. Dogwifhat Gains Amid Market Rebound Dogwifhat (WIF) was trading at $0.97 at press time, up 13.17% in the past 24 hours. The move follows Bitcoin’s new all-time high, which has improved overall market sentiment. Meme coins such as WIF, PENGU , and SPX6900 have all seen price increases as a result. WIF has also posted a 4.41% gain in the past week, with daily trading volume at $570 million. The price has fluctuated within a 24-hour range of $0.855 to $0.98 and a 7-day range of $0.82 to $0.98. The current trend shows WIF continuing its recovery, supported by bullish technical signals and increased trading activity. Cup and Handle Breakout Signals Strength Chart data confirms a breakout from a cup-and-handle pattern, a structure that often precedes upward price continuation. This breakout is supported by a golden cross between the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages, a signal that may reflect a shift toward sustained bullish pressure. Source: TradingView WIF is now approaching resistance at $1.031. Immediate support is visible around $0.9, and traders are watching whether the asset can maintain momentum above this level. The breakout from the descending handle pattern marks a strong shift in the short-term trend. Demand Zone Forms at Fibonacci Support Levels According to analyst Crypto Chiefs, the breakout leaves behind a strong demand zone between $0.8550 and $0.8776. This area coincides with the 0.618–0.75 Fibonacci retracement range. The price may revisit this zone in the event of a pullback, where buyers could step in again. $WIF – bullish break to the upside. It has left behind some strong demand around key Fibonacci levels which look interesting. pic.twitter.com/lg2tdwBpvA — Crypto Chiefs (@cryptochiefss) July 10, 2025 Consequently, these levels are being monitored closely for confirmation of sustained upward price action. As long as WIF holds above this support area, the outlook remains favorable for further upside. Data from Coinglass shows that WIF futures open interest has increased by 18%, reaching $480 million. At the same time, trading volume surged 85% to $2.41 billion. The rise in open interest alongside price movement suggests new long positions are entering the market.

2025-07-10T12:10:25,"Unlocking Crucial Bitcoin Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios","In the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, understanding market sentiment is paramount for any trader. One of the most powerful indicators for gauging this sentiment, especially for the flagship digital asset, is the BTC perpetual futures long-short ratio. This ratio provides a snapshot of how traders are positioning themselves – whether they expect Bitcoin’s price to rise (long) or fall (short). Let’s dive into the latest 24-hour data and uncover what these crucial numbers tell us about the current state of Bitcoin trading . What Are Long-Short Ratios and Why Do They Matter? Before we dissect the latest figures, it’s essential to grasp what long-short ratios represent. Simply put, this ratio compares the number of long positions (bets on price increase) to short positions (bets on price decrease) on perpetual futures contracts. Perpetual futures are a type of derivative that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without an expiry date, making them highly popular in the crypto space. Why is this data so vital for your crypto market analysis ? Here are a few reasons: Sentiment Indicator: A high long ratio suggests bullish sentiment, while a high short ratio indicates bearishness. Potential Reversals: Extreme imbalances in the ratio can sometimes signal a potential market reversal. For instance, an overwhelmingly long position might lead to a cascade of liquidations if the price unexpectedly drops. Liquidity and Open Interest: These ratios are often viewed in conjunction with open interest (the total number of outstanding derivative contracts) to get a fuller picture of market depth and potential volatility. Deep Dive into 24-Hour BTC Perpetual Futures Data Over the past 24 hours, the overall sentiment across various cryptocurrency exchanges shows a slight lean towards long positions for BTC perpetual futures . This indicates that more traders are currently betting on a price increase for Bitcoin than a decrease. Let’s look at the aggregated data and then break it down by top exchanges: Total Market Overview (Past 24 Hours): Position Type Percentage Long 51.56% Short 48.44% This marginal preference for long positions suggests a cautiously optimistic outlook among the broader trading community. It’s not an overwhelming bullish sentiment, but rather a slight tilt that could be interpreted in various ways, depending on other market factors. Exchange-Specific Insights: What Do Top Platforms Reveal About Bitcoin Trading ? While the aggregated data gives us a general idea, examining individual exchange data provides a more nuanced understanding of where specific trading activity and sentiment are concentrated. The top three exchanges in terms of volume and open interest often dictate broader market trends. Top Three Exchanges – 24-Hour Long-Short Ratios: Exchange Long Percentage Short Percentage Binance 52.67% 47.33% Bybit 50.34% 49.66% Gate.io 51.62% 48.38% Binance: Leading the Charge with a Bullish Bias Binance, being the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, often sets the tone for the market. Its long-short ratio of 52.67% long to 47.33% short indicates a slightly stronger bullish sentiment among its user base compared to the overall market average. This suggests that a significant portion of active traders on Binance are anticipating a positive price movement for Bitcoin. Bybit: A More Balanced Perspective Bybit’s figures show a much more balanced distribution, with 50.34% long and 49.66% short. This near 50/50 split indicates a more cautious or indecisive stance among Bybit traders. It could mean that while some are going long, an almost equal number are hedging their bets or actively shorting, reflecting a high degree of uncertainty or consolidation within that platform’s trading community. Gate.io: Mirroring the Market Average Gate.io’s ratio of 51.62% long to 48.38% short closely mirrors the overall market average. This suggests that traders on Gate.io are largely aligned with the broader sentiment observed across all exchanges, indicating a moderate bullish lean but not an aggressive one. Interpreting the Futures Trading Data : What Does It All Mean? The consistent slight bias towards long positions across these major exchanges, with none showing an overwhelming majority in either direction, paints a picture of cautious optimism. It suggests that while there’s underlying confidence in Bitcoin’s future price action, traders are not blindly rushing into long positions. This measured approach can be healthy for the market, preventing extreme overleveraging that could lead to sharp corrections. Key takeaways from this futures trading data : No Extreme Imbalance: The ratios are not heavily skewed, which is generally a good sign. Extreme long or short positions can often precede liquidations and rapid price movements. Slight Bullish Edge: The slight dominance of long positions suggests that the market believes in a positive trajectory for Bitcoin in the short term, albeit with reservations. Divergence in Sentiment: While the overall trend is similar, the slight differences between exchanges highlight that different trading communities might have varying levels of conviction. Actionable Insights for Your Crypto Market Analysis How can you use this information to refine your trading strategies? While long-short ratios are powerful, they should always be considered alongside other indicators like funding rates, open interest, volume, and technical analysis. Here are some actionable insights: Confirmation Tool: Use these ratios to confirm your existing biases. If your analysis suggests a bullish move and the long-short ratio supports it, it adds conviction to your trade. Warning Signal: If you see extreme long ratios (e.g., 70%+) without significant price movement, it might be a sign of overleveraging. A sudden price drop could trigger a cascade of liquidations, pushing the price down further. Contrarian Play: Sometimes, going against the crowd can be profitable. If the ratio is overwhelmingly long, a contrarian trader might look for signs of a short squeeze or a sudden reversal. Exchange-Specific Strategies: If you trade predominantly on one exchange, pay closer attention to its specific long-short ratio. The sentiment on Binance might differ slightly from Bybit, influencing your short-term decisions on that platform. Remember, no single indicator provides a complete picture. Integrating BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios into a broader analytical framework will yield the best results for your Bitcoin trading decisions. Conclusion: Navigating the Nuances of Bitcoin Trading Sentiment The 24-hour long-short ratios for BTC perpetual futures offer a fascinating glimpse into the collective psyche of Bitcoin traders. The current data points to a moderately bullish, yet cautious, sentiment across major exchanges. While the slight lean towards long positions suggests underlying confidence, the absence of extreme imbalance indicates a healthy market that is not overly leveraged in one direction. For anyone engaged in futures trading data analysis, these ratios are an indispensable tool for understanding market sentiment and potential price movements. By monitoring these figures alongside other technical and fundamental indicators, traders can make more informed decisions, navigate market volatility with greater confidence, and potentially unlock significant opportunities in the ever-evolving crypto landscape.
