2025-07-10T15:58:00,"Bitcoin: Price Breaks Out Of Consolidation And Retests The $112,000 High (Technical Analysis)","Summary Bitcoin surged 2.8% on Wednesday to retest May's all-time high. Profit-taking signals emerge from long-term holders' on-chain activity. $110,530 support to prevent Bitcoin from falling back into its eight-week range. By Sholanke Dele Bitcoin price surprised traders on Wednesday by posting a sharp 2.8% surge, its biggest gain in six days. The move broke through a narrow five-day range between $107,350 and $109,800, pushing price above June’s high at $110,530 and retesting the $112,000 all-time high that last printed in May. That breakout flipped the week’s performance from negative to positive and pushed July’s gain to 3.8%. Volume on the breakout day was stronger than the previous 14 sessions, confirming market conviction behind the move. But despite that, price action on Thursday has stalled. Bitcoin has hovered around $111,300 from the Asian session through the European session, showing signs of hesitation after Wednesday’s strength. BTC price dynamics (January - July 2025). Source: TradingView Sentiment hasn’t shifted much, either. The Binance fear and greed index is still in neutral territory at 58, a slight uptick from 52 the previous day. Traders are yet to show full commitment to a continuation above all-time highs. Bitcoin RSI and EMAs keep bullish structure, but hesitation near $112k limits upside Meanwhile, on-chain data flagged movement of dormant Bitcoin from long-term holders who had held coins for seven to ten years. These kinds of transfers often suggest profit-taking, especially after price reaches high-value areas like all-time highs. On the technical front, both the daily and 4-hour RSI are still showing bullish momentum, and price structure is supported by upward-trending EMAs. Bitcoin currently trades between two key levels: $110,530, now acting as support, and $112,000, which serves as resistance. If the price slips below $110,530, there’s a high chance Bitcoin may pull back into the consolidation range that has held for the last eight weeks between $100,000 and $112,000. But if bulls manage to absorb supply and reclaim strength above $112,000, it opens the door for a fresh breakout. Traders had aggressively shorted Bitcoin for nine weeks, but spot buyers defended 100k support . RSI stayed above 50 and signalled strength as Bitcoin held key levels.

Efforts to boost Cardano’s (ADA) price have yet to bring consistent returns. On Thursday, June 10, the Cardano Foundation released a report detailing its spending in 2024. According to the report, the Foundation spent $15 million on adoption, which includes flashy deals like the one with Barcelona FC. The report details that total expenditures for 2024 were $29.2 million. Of this, $22.1 million was allocated to expanding in strategic areas, including adoption, core operations, and education. Another $7.1 million was dedicated to sustaining these core areas, including legal, finance, and network infrastructure. You might also like: Cardano price approaches key resistance level, can bulls push ADA to $1? The funds came from the Cardano Foundation’s assets, which stood at $659.1 million at the end of 2024. The majority of these funds, or 76.7%, were in ADA, 14.9% were in Bitcoin (BTC) , and 8.3% were in cash and other assets. According to Frederik Gregaard, CEO of the Cardano Foundation, the goal is to ensure that these funds are used effectively. “The focus is on maintaining a sustainable balance between costs and income while maximizing impact for the broader ecosystem,” Frederik Gregaard, Cardano Foundation stated. You might also like: Solana, Cardano, XYZ: How high can these coins climb by the next 60-day cycle? When will Cardano’s price go up? Despite this spending, Cardano’s price performance has been lackluster this year. After a major rally in November, when ADA reached its yearly high of $1.32, the price has been on a sustained downtrend. Currently, Cardano’s price is down 50% from its highs in December of last year. Moreover, Cardano has failed to generate sustained user and developer engagement. Notably, Cardano has just 49 developers and a $348 million total value locked. In comparison, Solana has 232 dApps and TVL of over $20 billion. Additionally, many of these Cardano-based dApps have very little user activity . Cardano’s price will likely only sustainably go up once its ecosystem attracts more developers and more user activity.

2025-07-10T15:44:03,"BITO As A Complement To Bitcoin Holdings","Summary BITO offers indirect Bitcoin exposure via futures contracts, providing monthly income, unlike spot Bitcoin ETFs or direct ownership. BITO's futures-based structure reduces risks like theft and adds yield, making it a strong complement to existing Bitcoin holdings. Performance may lag spot Bitcoin during rangebound periods or due to contango. With Bitcoin near all-time highs and poised for a potential breakout, BITO is positioned to deliver capital appreciation and substantial income. The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ) was the first U.S. exchange-traded fund to offer exposure to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), and it continues to be an interesting allocation that can complement or supplement existing Bitcoin exposure. BITO does not directly hold any Bitcoin, but instead provides exposure through futures contracts that are rolled over, and which often allow its managers to distribute significant income on a monthly basis. This income generation feature makes BITO a strong addition to existing Bitcoin exposure that an investor is disinterested in selling, and which might not produce any yield. Unlike the multitude of ‘spot’ Bitcoin ETFs, such as the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ), which directly hold Bitcoin, BITO primarily invests in cash-settled, front-month Bitcoin futures that are traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ( CME ). Such futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a specified amount of Bitcoin at a predetermined price and future date. As a result, BITO tracks the price movements of those futures contracts. The fund actively manages its portfolio by rolling contracts, or selling expiring near-term contracts and replacing them with longer-term ones. BITO holdings (ProShares) This futures-based approach provides investors with indirect exposure to Bitcoin's price fluctuations without the complexities of directly owning, storing, or securing the digital asset. Moreover, since BITO does not hold Bitcoin, there is no risk that it might lose its Bitcoin to theft or accident. It also provides Bitcoin investors with monthly income, where directly holding the asset generally does not, and neither do most companies in the cryptocurrency business. BITO's 2025 distributions (ProShares) By rolling futures contracts, BITO maintains continuous exposure to Bitcoin, and also often realizes income that it distributes to investors. Of course, much of the income BITO might generate will come at the expense of capital appreciation. Therefore, BITO is likely to underperform when Bitcoin is rangebound for an especially long period of time, and especially if contango occurs. Much of this will depend upon the cost of futures contracts, which will vary along with volatility, as well as price and time. While the goal of BITO is to correspond to the performance of Bitcoin, it should not be expected to act as a perfect reflection of the spot price. When Bitcoin experiences a strong upward spike, BITO is likely to participate in that upside. The positive momentum in the underlying price of Bitcoin is also likely to outweigh the negative impact of contango (if present), or at least mitigate it. Nonetheless, it's still possible for BITO to slightly lag the spot price of Bitcoin during rapid upward moves due to contango. In some instances of extremely bullish sentiment, as well as the type of supply squeezes that are possible with Bitcoin, the Bitcoin futures market could slip into backwardation. If this happens during a strong rally, BITO could potentially outperform the spot price due to a positive roll yield, coupled with the appreciation from Bitcoin's price appreciation. This is uncommon, but possible. Therefore, it is generally more favorable to invest in BITO during periods when Bitcoin is expected to experience significant upward price movement. Given Bitcoin’s current valuation, which is close to its all time high after a period of rangebound consolidation, it appears highly possible that Bitcoin is preparing to make another strong move up the charts. If this is the case, BITO is likely to appreciate along with Bitcoin, while also providing substantial income in the near term. A significant portion of BITO's assets may not be directly invested in futures contracts, due to the rolling process and pending entering new contracts. Such cash is then held in short-term, U.S. Treasury securities and other high quality, investment grade cash instruments. The interest earned on such holdings also contributes to the fund's investment income. Risk BITO's performance may deviate from the spot price of Bitcoin due to various factors, including those affecting futures markets, such as contango and backwardation. It also has a significant management fee of 0.95 percent. Further, since Bitcoin and Bitcoin futures are highly volatile assets, BITO's valuation will be heavily influenced by price swings. BITO's performance is also clearly tethered to Bitcoin, so any significant decline to the price of the underlying asset would also be problematic for the fund. Since BITO is a futures-based ETF, it can have complex tax implications compared to holding spot Bitcoin or most other ETFs. Futures ETFs are often taxed as a Section 1256 contract, where 60% of gains are taxed at the long-term capital gains rate and 40% at the short-term capital gains rate, regardless of how long you hold the ETF. This issue would be sidestepped by in tax deferred or tax-free accounts, which would also shield the significant monthly distributions from tax. Conclusion BITO provides both exposure to Bitcoin and the potential for monthly income distributions. BITO has a dividend yield of about 53%, having paid approximately $11.19 per share over the past year. While Bitcoin is likely to slightly outperform BITO, the holding of futures contracts eliminates certain risks that could present themselves, including theft via hacking. Moreover, BITO's substantial income component makes it a compelling complement to existing Bitcoin holdings that an investor may not want to sell or expose to related risks that may arise through income generation. Given the potential for Bitcoin to spike higher in the near term, as well as later in 2025, BITO should be expected to continue to track Bitcoin reasonably closely and distribute above average income in the near term.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800397-bito-as-a-complement-to-bitcoin-holdings?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|REGULATION|MARKET","IBIT|FBTC|BTC-USD|BITO",cryptocompare

2025-07-10T15:40:39,"Ethereum Price Prediction: Arthur Hayes Unveils Bold $10,000 ETH Forecast","Are you ready for a potential seismic shift in the crypto world? BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, a figure known for his audacious and often accurate market calls, has once again captured the crypto community’s attention. In a recent post on X, Hayes signaled an incredibly bullish outlook for Ethereum (ETH), forecasting a staggering potential rise to $10,000. This isn’t just another casual prediction; it comes from a voice that commands respect in the volatile world of digital assets, making his Ethereum price prediction a hot topic of discussion among investors and enthusiasts alike. Who is Arthur Hayes and Why Does His Ethereum Price Prediction Matter? Before diving into the specifics of his forecast, it’s crucial to understand why Arthur Hayes’s words carry significant weight. As the co-founder and former CEO of BitMEX, one of the pioneering and largest cryptocurrency derivatives exchanges, Hayes has been at the forefront of the crypto industry for years. His insights are not merely speculative; they are often rooted in a deep understanding of market mechanics, macroeconomic factors, and the intricate dynamics of decentralized finance. He’s known for his provocative essays and candid commentary, which frequently offer a unique perspective on future market movements. Veteran Insight: Hayes possesses years of experience navigating bull and bear markets. Macro Perspective: He often ties crypto movements to broader global economic trends. Influential Voice: His predictions can influence market sentiment and investor behavior. Decoding the Bold ETH $10,000 Forecast: What’s Driving the Optimism? Hayes’s call for ETH $10,000 isn’t just a number pulled out of thin air. His recent post notably referenced the crypto meme “Arise Chikun,” a community-driven token inspired by the popular TV show Aqua Teen Hunger Force. This seemingly whimsical reference actually points to a deeper sentiment within the crypto community: the idea of a collective, grassroots resurgence and strength, often associated with tokens that gain viral traction and community support. But beyond the memes, what fundamental factors could underpin such a monumental leap for Ethereum? Several key developments and ongoing blockchain trends suggest that Ethereum’s ecosystem is maturing and expanding rapidly: Dencun Upgrade Impact: The recent Dencun upgrade significantly reduced transaction costs (gas fees) on Layer 2 networks built on Ethereum, making the ecosystem more scalable and accessible. This directly enhances Ethereum’s utility and appeal for dApps and users. Institutional Adoption: Growing institutional interest in Ethereum, particularly with discussions around potential spot Ethereum ETFs, could unlock massive capital inflows. DeFi and NFT Dominance: Ethereum remains the bedrock for the vast majority of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). As these sectors continue to innovate and expand, demand for ETH, which fuels these ecosystems, naturally increases. Supply Dynamics: With the implementation of EIP-1559 and the move to Proof-of-Stake (The Merge), Ethereum’s supply mechanics have become deflationary under certain network conditions, reducing the overall circulating supply and potentially increasing scarcity. Hayes’s bullish stance likely factors in a confluence of these technical improvements, network effects, and macro tailwinds that could propel Ethereum to unprecedented highs. Navigating the Broader Crypto Market Analysis in Light of Hayes’s Call An ETH $10,000 prediction doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s intricately linked to the broader crypto market analysis . Ethereum’s performance is often correlated with Bitcoin’s, but it also has its own unique drivers. While Bitcoin is seen as digital gold and a store of value, Ethereum is often referred to as ‘digital oil’ due to its utility as the foundational layer for countless decentralized applications. Consider the following market dynamics: Factor Impact on Ethereum Broader Market Relevance Bitcoin Halving Historically positive for altcoins post-halving Reduces new BTC supply, often a catalyst for bull runs Global Liquidity Increased risk appetite, flows into crypto Central bank policies, interest rates, economic growth Regulatory Clarity Attracts more institutional and retail investors Reduces uncertainty, legitimizes asset class Technological Advancements Improves scalability, security, and user experience Drives innovation across all blockchain ecosystems Hayes’s prediction suggests that Ethereum is not just riding Bitcoin’s coattails but is poised for an independent, utility-driven surge. This indicates a growing maturity in the crypto market where specific ecosystems like Ethereum can decouple or outperform based on their intrinsic value and development. Understanding Key Blockchain Trends Driving Ethereum’s Potential Beyond the immediate market dynamics, a deeper look at underlying blockchain trends reveals why Ethereum is so well-positioned for significant growth. Ethereum is at the epicenter of several transformative trends: Layer 2 Scaling Solutions: Projects like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon are massively expanding Ethereum’s transaction capacity and reducing costs, making it more competitive and user-friendly. This creates a powerful network effect, bringing more users and developers into the Ethereum orbit. Decentralized Applications (dApps): From decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to lending protocols and gaming platforms, Ethereum hosts the largest and most diverse array of dApps. As these applications gain mainstream adoption, the demand for ETH as gas and collateral increases. Tokenization of Real-World Assets (RWAs): The burgeoning trend of tokenizing real-world assets – from real estate to fine art – on the blockchain often utilizes Ethereum’s robust infrastructure. This opens up massive new markets for the network. Enterprise Blockchain Solutions: Many large corporations are exploring or implementing blockchain solutions, often leveraging Ethereum’s enterprise-grade versions (like Hyperledger Besu) or public network for their needs. These trends collectively paint a picture of an ecosystem that is not just surviving but thriving and evolving, continually finding new use cases and attracting more participants. This fundamental growth is what gives weight to ambitious predictions like Hayes’s. What Does This Mean for Your Ethereum Investment Strategy? An Ethereum price prediction of $10,000 naturally prompts questions about investment strategy. While such a forecast is exciting, it’s crucial to approach it with a balanced perspective. No investment is without risk, and the crypto market is famously volatile. Here are some actionable insights for those considering their Ethereum investment strategy : Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never rely solely on one prediction. Understand the technology, the market, and your own risk tolerance. Long-Term Vision: Predictions like Hayes’s often imply a long-term horizon. Short-term price fluctuations are common. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Consider investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price, to mitigate volatility risks. Portfolio Diversification: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Balance your portfolio with other assets, both crypto and traditional. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of Ethereum’s development, regulatory changes, and broader market sentiment. While the prospect of a $10,000 ETH is thrilling, a prudent approach involves understanding the underlying fundamentals and aligning your investment decisions with your personal financial goals and risk appetite. If you’re interested in learning more about the technical aspects of Ethereum’s scalability, you might find resources on Layer 2 solutions particularly insightful. For instance, this guide on Ethereum Layer 2 scaling provides a deeper dive into how these technologies are making the network more efficient. Conclusion: Is Ethereum Destined for $10,000? Arthur Hayes’s bold Ethereum price prediction of $10,000 is more than just a headline; it’s a reflection of growing confidence in Ethereum’s fundamental strength, its evolving ecosystem, and its pivotal role in the future of decentralized technology. While the journey to $10,000 may be fraught with volatility and unforeseen challenges, the underlying blockchain trends , combined with increasing institutional interest and continuous innovation, certainly paint a compelling picture for Ethereum’s long-term potential. Whether ETH reaches this ambitious target, one thing is clear: Ethereum remains a cornerstone of the crypto market, constantly adapting and expanding its utility. Investors should view Hayes’s prediction as a powerful signal of the immense possibilities that lie ahead, while always exercising caution and conducting thorough due diligence.

2025-07-10T15:11:12,"Bitcoin: The Asset That Drives Global Markets Is Being Ignored By Bitcoin Investors","Summary I recommend buying Bitcoin due to accelerating institutional adoption, with ETFs and funds now the largest holders and public companies increasing purchases. Bitcoin's market dominance has surged to 65%, its highest since 2021, as investors favor it over altcoins for digital value storage. The correlation between Bitcoin and US Treasuries has reached a record low, signaling Bitcoin's emergence as an independent, diversifying asset class. Despite low volatility, Bitcoin is near all-time highs, with promising price forecasts and strong support from institutional flows and market trends. Investment Thesis I recommend buying Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). Institutional adoption continues to accelerate, as ETFs and funds are the largest institutional holders of the cryptocurrency. Publicly traded companies have also shown a significant appetite for Bitcoin in recent quarters. Bitcoin is increasingly relevant in the cryptocurrency market. However, its correlation with Treasuries has reached its lowest level on record, demonstrating its decoupling from traditional assets. Meanwhile, price forecasts are promising. Very Close to All-Time High We're at the beginning of the second half of the year, and one of the most controversial investment theses is undoubtedly Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency is very close to reaching its all-time high , but prices have shown little volatility since the beginning of the year. Analyst's rating history (The Author) This article is a continuation of my investment thesis published in November 2024, also with a buy recommendation. Next, we'll analyze the latest Bitcoin data and trends and make some estimates. Institutional Adoption Institutional investors hold about 16% of the total bitcoin supply , or 3.4 million. Of this share, ETFs and funds are the largest holders, with 40.4%, reinforcing institutional appeal following recent regulations. Number of coins by category (Bitcoin Treasuries and CNBC) In my view, the most emblematic example among institutional investors with Bitcoin is BlackRock's ETFs. You may not have realized it, but the IBIT ETF surpassed the IVV ETF (despite being 9x larger) in fees to the company. The IBIT ETF has $76 billion in assets under management and a 0.25% expense ratio, generating a fee of approximately $190 million per year. The IVV ETF has $626 billion in assets under management and a 0.03% expense ratio, generating a fee of approximately $187.8 million per year. Another sign of progress in institutional adoption comes from publicly traded companies. This is the third consecutive quarter that publicly traded companies have purchased more Bitcoin than ETFs. In the second quarter of 2025 alone, companies purchased 131,000 Bitcoins. Net bitcoin flows for public companies and ETFs (Bitcoin Treasuries and CNBC) But the cryptoasset's growth isn't limited to institutional investors. Bitcoin is becoming even more prominent within the cryptocurrency market, and we'll explore this in more detail below. Representation in the Cryptocurrency Market Despite low volatility in prices this year, Bitcoin once again reached a 65% share of the cryptocurrency market. This is its highest level since January 2021 and a remarkable recovery from the 38% low seen in 2022. Bitcoin Dominance Chart (Creative Planning) This corroborates the thesis that investors are opting for Bitcoin over altcoins . There are other signs that also point to this, and few analysts are addressing them. Independent Asset A great example of this is the chart below. The correlation between Bitcoin's price and US 10-year Treasury futures over a 60-day window has fallen to its lowest level ever. This means that Bitcoin is increasingly behaving like an independent asset. Correlation Between US 10-year Treasury futures and Bitcoin (Bitwise) This decoupling is a strong indicator of consolidation as an asset class, which can finally promote real diversification in investor portfolios. Bitcoin increasingly reacts to institutional flow and specific market events. Target Price In my last article, I presented a method for estimating the fair price based on Bitcoin's correlation with the global money supply ( M2 category), which is a measure of the total amount of money in circulation in the world. Global M2 vs. bitcoin lagged 10 weeks (SYZ) The estimate indicates a target price of $125,000, which seems credible and supports the buy recommendation. I remain confident in the recommendation, given the confirmation from Seeking Alpha's Quant tools, with a strong buy recommendation in IBIT ETF. Quant Rating And ETF Grades (Seeking Alpha) However, my goal is to provide investors with more information, and I'll share another method for achieving the fair price that caught my attention. This is the Stock-to-Flow model, used to estimate the price of scarce assets. The formula consists of dividing the total quantity of the asset in circulation by the new quantity produced per year. The projections are shown in the chart below. Stock-to-Flow Model (BITBO) The chart shows three major valuation cycles following halvings in 2012, 2016, and 2020. According to this estimate, the fair price after the 2024 halving could reach approximately $250,000 by the end of 2025. Although it is an upside of 127%, the asset's recent performances show that there is a chance for this performance. Potential Threats To The Bullish Thesis There are several risks to this thesis. The Stock-to-Flow model's pricing, for example, ignores demand and considers only supply. Furthermore, there is no forecast of economic shocks such as financial crises or regulatory changes. Additionally, after the 2021 cycle, the model did not accurately achieve Bitcoin's price projections, leading some analysts to question, or even discredit, the model. There are also criticisms of the M2 supply model. The 10-week price shift is arbitrary. Furthermore, the similarity between M2 supply and the Bitcoin price does not prove that one causes the other. The global increase in liquidity could boost several assets, in addition to Bitcoin. The Bottom Line Despite being near its all-time high, Bitcoin's low volatility has surprised investors in 2025. However, many signs support an optimistic outlook for the crypto asset going forward. Institutional adoption is accelerating, and in addition to ETF managers, publicly traded companies are buying Bitcoin like never before. The decorrelation with US Treasuries indicates that the asset is becoming an independent asset. Based on this analysis, I recommend buying Bitcoin. As an independent asset, Bitcoin can finally play a diversifying role in investors' portfolios, and the upside based on the metrics shown is very attractive.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800385-bitcoin-the-asset-that-drives-global-markets-is-being-ignored-by-bitcoin-investors?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|TRADING|ALTCOIN","BTC-USD",cryptocompare

Learn more and register today . – Sarah Morton Unknown block type ""divider"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Two Years In, and Just Getting Started Two years ago, I took on the role of editor for Crypto for Advisors at a pivotal moment. It was mid-2023, and the cryptocurrency industry was in the midst of a deep winter. The collapse of major lending platforms and the implosion of FTX had sent shockwaves through the markets. The U.S. regulatory climate was hostile, marked by enforcement-first tactics, and confidence was shaken. But even then, the undercurrents of something bigger were impossible to ignore. Fast forward to today, and we’re standing on the edge of what Bank of America calls a “ once-in-a-millennium transformation. ” They’re not talking about memes or speculation. They’re talking about the reshaping of global financial infrastructure, economic models, and digital ownership — and it’s being driven by crypto. An Ode to Bitcoin: The Genesis “Bitcoin belongs in the same breath as the printing press and artificial intelligence.” — Bank of America: Bitcoin, born in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, created something revolutionary: a decentralized, fixed-supply digital currency. It belonged to no government, no corporation, and no central authority. From there, a movement began. Early adoption saw students tinkering with GPUs, developers building wallets, entrepreneurs launching exchanges, and miners chasing cheap power around the globe. A technological and economic revolution took shape. Today, we’re seeing bitcoin ETFs from the world’s largest asset managers — BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale being the top three by AUM — and even nation-state adoption as countries like the U.S. and UAE race to become global crypto hubs. It’s an unparalleled acceleration of financial innovation. The Rise of Ethereum and Smart Contracts Bitcoin sparked the fire, but Ethereum — and the smart contract innovation it introduced — brought utility, programmability, and the ability to tokenize everything: real estate, carbon credits, fine art, identity, equities, and even yield-generating protocols. While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate headlines, tens of thousands of digital assets exist. And while investing grabs the spotlight, blockchain is quietly transforming supply chains, intellectual property, finance, and more. Public companies are adding crypto to their balance sheets. Over 140 public firms have announced bitcoin reserves. Exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken will offer tokenized equities, while retail platforms like Robinhood expand their crypto products. Access points are multiplying: direct-to-consumer platforms, ETFs (now in the hundreds), tokenized funds, and direct ownership. And the list keeps growing. The Landscape Has Changed — Are You Adopting? Only a handful of advisors were very early adopters but that’s slowly evolving. There’s broadening recognition of the opportunity — to support clients, protect relationships, and win new business. It's becoming increasingly common to hear from advisors that they are winning clients simply because they’re willing to talk about bitcoin. On the other hand, the lack of regulation, prohibitive firm policies, digital assets volatility behavior and overall uncertainty with a new asset class has caused hesitancy. Moreover, advisors have a lot to pay attention to —- and now learning a new — and always changing — asset class is added to the list! Despite all of this, clients want to access digital assets. Recent Coinshares survey data highlights that clients want the help of their advisors and expect them to be knowledgeable in digital assets. More than 80% of the respondents answered that they would be more likely to work with an advisor that offers digital asset guidance, and 78% of non-crypto investors say they’d turn to an advisor if crypto support were available. Notably, almost 90% said they planned to increase their crypto exposure in 2025. A Call to Action Blockchain is an infrastructure, crypto is more than an asset class and the technology extends well beyond investing. The industry is maturing,regulation is advancing andthe world’s largest institutions are developing on blockchain. As U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said recently, “Crypto is the most important phenomenon happening in the world today.” You don’t need to be a crypto trader or blockchain developer. But if you’re a fiduciary — a guide, a planner — you owe it to your clients to understand what’s happening. Education is key. In two years of curating this newsletter, I’ve watched sentiment shift from skepticism to curiosity to strategic integration. And we’re just getting started. I’m thrilled to be here with you on your crypto journey. Connect with me for ideas on future topics you’d like to see addressed. - Sarah Morton, chief strategy officer, MeetAmi Innovations Inc. Unknown block type ""divider"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Ask an Expert Q. Why is the same digital asset priced differently on each exchange? A. Equities “plug in” to an exchange, allowing for one, centralized price. Crypto, on the contrary, is “decentralized.” This means there’s not one “plug” to price a digital asset. While crypto prices are based on supply and demand (as well as other factors), each exchange operates independently and therefore prices can vary between different exchanges. Q. How can I find reliable pricing data for digital assets? A. There are many digital asset index and data providers. Look for pricing that (1) comes from a reputable and trusted provider with a proven track record in digital assets, (2) has a transparent and rules-based approach to construction, and (3) lays out thoughtfully constructed criteria for how the pricing is captured. The index methodology is incredibly important. For example, if selection criteria of an index included “trading on more than one eligible exchange” with eligibility thoughtfully designed, then in the case of the FTX collapse, FTT (the exchange token of FTX) wouldn’t have made it into the index. Thoughtful construction can rule out bad actors. Q. Why are people using bitcoin to measure the entire digital asset landscape? A. While bitcoin now accounts for 65% of the total digital asset market, there were times bitcoin was less than 40% of the market. One asset should not be a benchmark for the entire asset class. Diversification is key for institutional investors to manage volatility and capture broader opportunities. Effective benchmarking must serve multiple constituencies—enabling performance evaluation, supporting investment strategies, and setting industry standards for everyone. Indices such as CoinDesk 5 (CD5), CoinDesk 20 (CD20), CoinDesk 80 (CD80), CoinDesk 100 (CD100) and CoinDesk Memecoin (CDMEME) were constructed to meet the needs of those looking to benchmark, trade and/or invest in the ever-evolving digital asset landscape. - Kim Klemballa, CoinDesk Indices Unknown block type ""divider"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Keep Reading CoinDesk breaks down the June crypto markets and ETF/ETP flows .

2025-07-10T14:54:45,"Best Crypto to Buy Now With New SEC Guidelines On Cryptocurrency ETPs","For years, the idea of government regulation in crypto sparked heated debates. Many saw it as a threat to the decentralized spirit that gave birth to Bitcoin and altcoins. But as the space matured, and as major institutions, banks, and even governments began stepping in, the conversation changed. Regulation, once viewed with suspicion, is increasingly seen as a necessary framework to help crypto scale responsibly. The SEC’s latest guidelines reflect this narrative too. Rather than stifling innovation, they aim to give crypto a defined place within the broader financial system, offering clarity on risks, custody, and disclosures. This moment could mark a turning point, one where crypto is no longer just an outsider asset, but a recognized player with vast potential ahead. SEC’s New Guidelines and What They Mean for Crypto The SEC’s recent release of detailed guidance for crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) marks one of the clearest regulatory moves in recent memory. After months of watching crypto ETFs flourish with little uniformity, the Commission has now outlined specific areas issuers must address. Chief among these are disclosures on price volatility, custodial practices, hacking risks, and market manipulation safeguards. Issuers are expected to break down exactly how they handle private key security and whether they use cold, warm, or hot storage solutions. 🚨NEW: The SEC’s Corp Fin division has issued fresh guidance on disclosure expectations for crypto ETPs. It gives a detailed outline of what issuers need to include in filings — from how they calculate NAV and select benchmarks to custody practices, service provider… pic.twitter.com/s5rvTbq2dE — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) July 1, 2025 Importantly, the SEC is also asking for transparency around incidental rights like forks, airdrops, or other network events that can impact coin supply and value. Another key point is clarifying how fees erode the underlying crypto per share over time. For investors, these guidelines create a more transparent landscape, helping advisors and clients alike better understand the products they engage with. For the crypto industry, it sets the stage for faster, clearer approvals and signals that regulators are taking digital assets seriously, not to restrain them, but to integrate them meaningfully into financial markets. In parallel, Bitcoin has once again broken past the $112,000 all-time high, a milestone that coincides with this regulatory progress. Whether coincidence or correlation, demand for crypto appears to be surging, making this an unusually compelling time to evaluate entry into Bitcoin and altcoins as both adoption and legitimacy accelerate. Best Crypto to Buy Now As Altcoin Demand Starts Increasing Best Wallet Token Best Wallet Token serves as the native token of Best Wallet, a multi-chain Web3 wallet built to simplify crypto management for users without reducing functionality. It handles cross-chain transactions, decentralized finance activities, NFT storage, and portfolio tracking within a single, unified system. The token plays several roles: it reduces transaction fees inside the wallet, grants access to advanced features, and gives holders a say in how the platform develops over time. Having raised more than $13 million already, one of the main features that the project offers is its transaction batching mechanism, which allows multiple actions to be combined into a single on-chain approval. This reduces both time and gas costs, creating a smoother user experience. In addition, token holders can participate in staking, receiving rewards while helping secure the wallet’s operations. 🔥 Over $13M Raised and Counting! 🔥Best Wallet is becoming the go-to for traders who want speed, simplicity, and early access to what matters:✅ Buy new tokens early, directly in-app✅ Buy and bridge across chains in one place✅ Full portfolio control, no clutterDownload… pic.twitter.com/0SDNVPov6v — Best Wallet (@BestWalletHQ) June 4, 2025 With the SEC’s recent guidelines offering more structure around crypto products, tools like Best Wallet are well placed to meet the needs of a growing user base seeking both simplicity and transparency. As crypto shifts from an experimental niche to part of mainstream finance, having a wallet that meets technical demands while aligning with clearer regulatory expectations becomes more valuable. Best Wallet Token, through its practical functions and governance layer, fits into this changing environment, offering users an integrated approach to managing digital assets with greater confidence. SUBBD SUBBD offers a decentralized platform designed for digital creators to engage with their audiences without the limitations often imposed by traditional platforms. Through SUBBD, creators can monetize their work directly using subscriptions, one-time tips, and collaborative projects, bypassing the commissions and algorithm-driven exposure models common elsewhere. The SUBBD token enables payments, governs platform decisions, and supports creator-led initiatives, creating a more balanced relationship between creators and their supporters. One of its most practical features is the automated subscription model powered by smart contracts. Fans can subscribe using micro-payments that renew automatically on-chain, ensuring creators receive support without middlemen. Creators can also issue access tokens for premium content or exclusive updates, providing tailored experiences for their communities. With the SEC’s recent push for better disclosure and clarity in crypto projects, platforms like SUBBD gain relevance. Clearer regulatory frameworks help define how tokenized creator economies can operate without legal uncertainty. For creators, this reduces risks tied to sudden platform changes or revenue disruptions. For audiences, it offers more transparency in how they support the voices they care about. As digital economies evolve alongside regulatory improvements, SUBBD reflects how crypto can reshape industries beyond finance and introduce fairer models for creative work. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper is a Layer 2 network developed to increase Bitcoin’s scalability and functionality by processing transactions off-chain while anchoring final settlement to Bitcoin’s main network. This approach allows for higher transaction throughput and the use of smart contracts without modifying Bitcoin’s core design, effectively expanding what can be built around it. A central feature is the use of rollup technology combined with zero-knowledge proofs, which compress large sets of transactions before they are finalized on-chain. This reduces network congestion and opens space for decentralized applications such as exchanges, lending markets, and NFT platforms that rely on faster, more efficient infrastructure. The timing of Bitcoin Hyper’s progress coincides with the SEC’s new guidelines, which offer clearer rules for custody, transparency, and market safeguards. While these guidelines apply broadly, they set a more predictable backdrop for projects that connect to major assets like Bitcoin. The project has already gained recognition, thanks to multiple media posts and YouTube videos, especially on high-reach channels like 99Bitcoins and more. Recently, Bitcoin crossed the $112,000 level again, a milestone reflecting renewed demand across the crypto market. Projects like Bitcoin Hyper benefit from this momentum by offering the infrastructure that supports further use cases and adoption, making the broader crypto space more accessible and capable. Token 6900 Token 6900 takes an unconventional approach in a space crowded with projects that often chase trends without offering substance. Built around community participation and self-aware design, Token 6900 operates as both a social experiment and a functional ecosystem. It creates an economy where holders shape the narrative and direction, not through vague promises but through clear, rule-based interactions coded directly into its smart contracts. One example is how the token uses event-triggered mechanisms. When certain milestones are hit; for example, a specified number of transfers or liquidity events, then the contract executes predefined actions, such as adjusting supply or redistributing a portion of the pool back to active holders. This creates a dynamic environment where engagement is not just cosmetic but has measurable impact on the token’s state. The SEC’s recent emphasis on transparency and disclosure indirectly benefits projects like Token 6900. While it thrives on unpredictability within its own ecosystem, the framework within which it operates becomes clearer when regulators define how risks, rewards, and mechanics must be communicated to the public. TOKEN6900 full of raisins. $250k mfers. pic.twitter.com/bczl1mencT — Token6900 (@Token_6900) July 9, 2025 This helps filter out projects relying on ambiguity or hype alone, giving space for those that have real structure behind their ideas. As interest in alternative tokens grows alongside broader crypto momentum, Token 6900 presents itself as a case study in how creative ecosystems can function with purpose in an increasingly mature digital market. Snorter Snorter is a Telegram-integrated bot that blends artificial intelligence with crypto utility, offering users a way to interact with blockchain features directly from their chat interface. Rather than requiring external platforms or complex steps, Snorter lets users execute functions like price tracking, wallet management, token swaps, and on-chain queries within Telegram itself. This makes crypto activity feel closer to everyday communication, lowering the barrier to entry for a wide range of users. A particularly useful feature is Snorter’s ability to automate trades based on predefined triggers. For instance, users can set instructions for the bot to execute swaps if certain market conditions are met, creating an experience that merges accessibility with real-time action. Additionally, Snorter supports community management tools for projects, enabling token distribution, announcements, and community analytics within a familiar environment. With the SEC’s new guidelines pushing for clearer communication around how crypto tools operate, bots like Snorter stand to benefit. Users will increasingly look for services that explain their functions, risks, and limitations in straightforward terms. Snorter’s mix of convenience and transparency aligns with this shift, offering a service that is both practical and accountable. As the market continues to draw in new participants, especially following Bitcoin’s surge past $112,000, tools that simplify crypto interactions without compromising clarity will likely see heightened demand. Conclusion The SEC’s recent move creates a market environment where serious projects can thrive, and where both investors and developers gain more confidence in the stability of the space. It is not about eliminating risk, but about understanding the framework in which risk operates. Combined with Bitcoin’s recent surge past previous highs and the visible increase in altcoin demand, the stage appears set for a new phase of activity. Projects, like the ones mentioned above, stand to gain heavily from such developments, making it one of the best times to start accumulating for high returns in the coming months.

2025-07-10T14:30:46,"Bitcoin is aiding Afghanistan's human rights push","Digital currencies are providing Women in Afghanistan with the tools to stand up against an oppressive regime. That’s according to the Digital Citizen Fund (DCF) founder Roya Mahboob, who was speaking in an interview on the sidelines of the Bitcoin Policy Summit . The tech entrepreneur and human rights advocate said Bitcoin and other crypto assets offered her sisters suffering under the Taliban’s restrictive rule a hope of bettering their lives. Ms Mahboob added that her organization provided Afghan women with financial and digital literacy through online and underground channels. A significant part of that training is on BTC ownership and use. She said Afghanistan’s restrictive setup made the premier cryptocurrency a survival tool, hence their teaching them how to transact in it. According to her, that restrictiveness also makes it easy for the women to understand it, explaining, “It’s much easier for them to get it because it gives them a hope of financial freedom.” Bitcoin is aiding Afghanistan’s human rights push Ms Mahboob also stated that her initiative transcends the coin’s transactional aspects. She has integrated human rights aspects into her BTC campaigns by collaborating with the Human Rights Foundation. To her, the crypto asset’s decentralized nature made it a vital cog in pushing for the democratization of financial services in her country. Afghanistan’s prohibitive setup has for long prevented women from accessing financial services for different reasons. These include a lack of IDs, denial of rights to paid employment, restrictions on accessing education, and financial matters. This situation worsened with hardline Islamists seizing power. Banks denied Afghans who’d worked for the previous regime, civil society, women’s rights organisations, and services. However, Ms Mahboob explained that BTC and other cryptos were giving them the means to skirt the social and financial ostracization many still face. Their people-centric nature gave her and other rights campaigners hope of freeing Afghanistan’s oppressed from their economic shackles. Afghanistan’s Bitcoin campaign has a long way to go Despite the steady gains that Ms. Mahboob’s BTC education campaign has made, it still faces significant challenges. The main obstacle is education as the entire Afghan womenfolk can’t access education, for four years since fundamentalists overran Kabul. That has meant using undercover schools at the peril of the learners and instructors. Moreover, the movement faces connectivity challenges, particularly in rural Afghanistan. The DCF depends on the internet to disseminate its educational material in a country with one of the lowest global internet coverage rates and strict censorship policies. Add to the complexity that comes with understanding crypto technology, and that makes reaching the target audience daunting. Afghanistan has enforced a strict cryptocurrency ban since 2022, motivated by religious and economic policies under Taliban rule. Yet, crypto transactions remain active in underground markets, powered by peer-to-peer (P2P) networks that evade government control. Rooted in Sharia law, the ban has pushed crypto use into secrecy, where it continues to play a vital role in remittances and personal savings. Officially, all forms of crypto transactions remain “haram” with authorities threatening severe reprisals for anyone undertaking them. What’s encouraging, though, is that an underground crypto market thrived. Whispers have even suggested Talibros are in it, perhaps indicating a change of tune. Other countries that have banned digital assets include Bangladesh, Nepal, Algeria, Morocco, and Bolivia. While crypto is welcomed in many parts of the world, these countries are wary of its volatility and decentralized nature. Some also perceive it as a threat to their current monetary systems while being concerned about its use to support illicit activities like drug trafficking, money laundering, and terrorism. Several nations have outright banned digital currency, while others have tried to cut off any banking and financial system support essential for its trading and use.

2025-07-10T14:30:35,"‘The Math Just Doesn’t Work’ – Analyst Hits JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs With Downgrade, Says Downside Risk Not Factored In","HSBC is detailing its major downgrade of JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America. On Tuesday, HSBC dropped its recommendation on JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) from hold to reduce. The firm also downgraded the recommendation on Bank of America from buy to hold. In an interview , HSBC’s head of US financials research, Saul Martinez, says the banks have solid fundamentals, but their valuations raise concerns. “We were not adopting a more negative view of operating fundamentals. We still think that net interest income is on the right track. You know, you are seeing some growth there. Obviously, there are some nuances to each of the downgrades, JPMorgan, Goldman to reduce and Bank of America to hold, but at a high level, it’s valuation. Pricing is not factoring in downside risk and the dilutive impact of buybacks at much higher multiples.” Martinez says he was not convinced that JPMorgan deserves its price. “In JPMorgan’s case, I think the math just doesn’t work at these valuations. The stock, so with banks, you look at price to tangible book value multiples and return on tangible common equity. Higher ROTC (return on tangible common equity), higher price to tangible. JPMorgan is trading close to three times tangible. That is a very elevated multiple.” He says it’s a similar case for Goldman Sachs. “We feel like we’re swimming against the tide with Goldman a little bit because the investment banking landscape is good. The risk-reward is very skewed here. We think good news is priced in, but again, if the market cools off and IB (investment banking) activity doesn’t really move forward, we don’t get a super cycle in IB activity, I think there’s more room for disappointment here than for upside.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-10T14:30:34,"Insights From Ripple CEO’s Testimony To Senate Banking Committee","Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse delivered a notable testimony before the Senate Committee on Banking on Wednesday, emphasizing the need for clear regulatory frameworks in the cryptocurrency industry. Ripple’s Vision Garlinghouse began his intervention by noting that with over a decade of experience, Ripple, the company associated with XRP, aims to create an “Internet of Value,” where money transfers seamlessly, akin to the movement of information. Garlinghouse highlighted that Ripple’s software solutions are designed to enhance cross-border payments, support stablecoins, and improve digital custody for financial institutions, ultimately benefiting consumers and the global economy. Central to Ripple’s operations is the XRP Ledger (XRPL), a decentralized blockchain that facilitates fast and cost-effective transactions through its native digital asset, XRP. Garlinghouse noted that Ripple has consistently chosen to engage with policymakers and regulators, adopting a compliance-first approach. The company holds over 60 licenses for payment services and cryptocurrencies, both domestically and internationally. Calls For Clear Crypto Regulations When it comes to regulation, Garlinghouse outlined several foundational principles for effective cryptocurrency legislation . He stressed the importance of protecting consumers from fraud, ensuring proper oversight in markets, regulating bad actors, and fostering innovation. He argued that a well-structured regulatory framework for digital assets and stablecoins would not only expand access to financial markets but also create jobs and stimulate economic growth, positioning the US as a leader in blockchain technology. Garlinghouse pointed out that the ongoing legal and regulatory uncertainties surrounding cryptocurrency have stifled meaningful progress in the US. He shared Ripple’s experience as a target of regulatory enforcement, particularly when the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against the company in 2020. After a lengthy legal battle, Ripple achieved a favorable ruling, affirming that XRP is not inherently a security. This victory, he argued, has paved the way for other companies in the industry to assert their rights. Can Congress Propel America To Crypto Greatness? Despite facing significant challenges, Ripple remains committed to educating and collaborating with lawmakers. However, Garlinghouse urged Congress to enact smart and principled legislation that sets clear jurisdictional boundaries for primary financial regulators. Highlighting the US’s potential as a leader in the digital asset space, Garlinghouse pointed to the nation’s deep capital markets and technical talent. He noted that over 55 million Americans are involved in the crypto economy, contributing to a market cap of approximately $3.4 trillion. According to him, a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrency is essential to unlock efficiencies in financial transactions and enhance competitiveness in the global market. In closing, Garlinghouse called for the Senate to prioritize the passage of market structure legislation for digital assets. He believes that such legislation will usher in a new era of US leadership in cryptocurrency, benefiting both consumers and businesses.

2025-07-10T14:23:15,"Bitcoin Blasts to $112,017 ATH – What’s the Best Crypto to Buy Before the Next Surge?","After hovering below the $110K mark over the past few weeks, Bitcoin hit a new all-time high yesterday. Bolstered by growing institutional adoption, $BTC is stronger than ever. And that means now’s the time to buy crypto before the next surge. $BTC finally reached the $100K milestone late last year, before outdoing itself in May, when it reached $111,970. Making it to $112,017 is another first for the crypto OG. Make no mistake, Lady Luck played no hand in Bitcoin’s surge. It’s down to an ever-growing list of financial institutions worldwide that are recognizing the value of $BTC, due in part to supportive government policies. Top Guns Weigh In Bitcoin champion Michael Saylor, Executive Chairman of Strategy, argues that Bitcoin has gotten through its riskiest period. In fact, he told Bloomberg in a June 10 interview that he believes that $BTC will be $1M. “The President of the United States supports Bitcoin. The Cabinet supports Bitcoin. [Treasury Secretary] Scott Bessent supports Bitcoin. Paul Atkins has shown himself to be enthusiastic about bitcoin and digital assets. Brian Quintenz at CFTC feels that the banks will custody Bitcoin.” Saylor explained that Bitcoin Treasury companies are buying $BTC’s natural supply. In addition, “BlackRock and the ETFs are buying another measure of that, and we’ve got nation-state actors coming into the space. The writing is on the wall. Bitcoin is moving higher.” Bitcoin’s status as a heavyweight institutional asset is solidifying fast. And while Saylor’s Strategy continues to grab the spotlight, the corporate herd is growing. Take GameStop, for instance. It made waves in May by greenlighting Bitcoin buys at the board level. Soon after, GameStop purchased 4.71K Bitcoin . And for its part, the Trump Media and Technology Group is also eyeing a blended crypto ETF. Dubbed the “ Crypto Blue Chip ETF ,” it plans to offer exposure to five digital assets. Some 70% of the ETF’s holdings will be in $BTC, 15% in $ETH, 8% in $SOL, and 5% in $XRP. The remaining 2% of the ETF’s holdings will be in $CRO – the native token of the ETF’s digital custodian, the exchange Crypto.com . Bitcoin Wins, Crypto Scores With fresh ETF inflows, increased corporate balance sheet exposure, the rise of crypto futures , and a more favorable regulatory environment, $BTC is experiencing a powerful surge in institutional interest. And the momentum shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. So, if you’re wondering which crypto to buy before the next big surge, you’re in the right place. Here are three altcoins with massive potential to explode when $BTC rallies again. If Michael Saylor’s predictions hold true, that surge could be just around the corner. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Scalability for Bitcoin Through an L2 In keeping with all things $BTC, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) brings an exciting proposal to the crypto table. A Bitcoin Layer-2 (L2) platform. The Bitcoin blockchain has a lot going for it, especially in terms of top-level security. It falls short, however, in terms of speed and high transaction fees, especially when compared to the likes of Solana. In short, Bitcoin lacks scalability. That’s where $HYPER steps up to the plate. This upcoming meme coin is set to power an innovative Bitcoin L2 ecosystem that will increase the speed and reduce fees. More importantly, it adds cross-chain compatibility. That means seamless access to the best meme coins , DeFi, and dApps. At the moment, Bitcoin Hyper is on presale. That means you can buy it for $0.0122. You can also stake your $HYPER for 360% APY. If you’re keen to discover more about this L2 and the meme coin behind it, take a look at our guide to buying $HYPER . It explains all you need to know. Keep in mind, though, that as a presale, the price of $HYPER will increase in stages, offering you the chance to secure tokens at a lower cost now. Additionally, the rewards APY is dynamic and will decrease over time, so the earlier you get in, the better the returns. Once $HYPER lists on DEXs after the presale, the price is expected to rise even further, so now is a prime opportunity to get involved before the price climbs. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Driving Global Crypto Wallet Market Domination It’s not only institutions that are taking Bitcoin and other digital assets much more seriously these days. With the growing number of retail, as in individual, investors also entering the scene, it means a bigger demand for crypto wallets. That’s what makes the Best Wallet Token ($BEST) one to watch with a very close eye. It’s the native token of Best Wallet, a non-custodial, no KYC, multi-chain, and multi-currency hot wallet that is gaining serious market traction. So much so that Best Wallet is on a mission to dominate 40% of the global crypto wallet market by the end of next year. And it’s using $BEST to help it achieve that target. Holding $BEST means additional benefits and features of what is already a leading crypto wallet. That includes being able to buy the best presale crypto directly from the mobile wallet (a market first, by the way); lower transaction fees; and higher staking rewards. $BEST also comes with community governance. So you can have a say in the project’s direction – including the presale tokens available to buy, and other features. $BEST is also on presale. Buy yours today for $0.025305 and stake it for 99% before the upcoming price increase. Our How To Buy $BEST guide explains how to do just that. 3. America Party ($AP) – On the Heels Of Musk’s New Party The America Party Token ($AP ) is another newcomer to the crypto scene. It was launched mere days after Elon Musk announced he intends to create a new political party. However, unlike $HYPER and $BEST, which are both on presale, $AP is already listed on DEXs. To be clear, though, the $AP token is not affiliated with Musk or the America Party he is launching. That said, $AP does stand to ride on Musk’s coattails. And to sweeten the deal, when Musk mentions a cryptocurrency, meme coins in particular, that token often explodes. And recently, Musk was asked by a follower whether his America Party will embrace Bitcoin. His response was definitive: “Fiat is useless, so yes.” Another boost for crypto. Right now, $AP costs $0.01830 – up 239.38% since it launched on July 7. Get yours today through UniSwap or MEXC. “The Writing’s On The Wall” As Saylor put it, “Bitcoin is moving higher.” And while the market can be unpredictable at best, $BTC’s latest rally to $112K is a definitive indicator that the institutional adoption of digital assets is positively impacting, and with signs of slowing. That means newer cryptos like $HYPER , $BEST , and $AP also have the potential to pump if current conditions continue. And the best part of investing in new tokens is getting in at an early-bird price. That said, nothing is guaranteed, and we’re not financial advisers. Be sure to always DYOR research before making any investment.",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-blasts-to-ath/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL","Cryptocurrency Market News",cryptocompare

James Wynn, a high-profile crypto trader and risk-taker, has opened a massive short-term Bitcoin trade with 40x leverage. With $1.27 million on the line, Wynn is betting that Bitcoin’s price is about to drop. But does this mean another correction is coming soon? James Wynn Short Bitcoin With 40x Leverage According to Lookonchain, James Wynn just put 27,522 USDC into Hyperliquid and picked up nearly $4,000 in referral rewards. He then used the money to open a 40x leveraged short on Bitcoin, betting that the price would drop. With this much leverage, even a small drop could give him big profits, but if Bitcoin rises instead, he could lose it all fast. Right now, Wynn’s short is worth 11.45 BTC, or about $1.27 million. If Bitcoin climbs past $112,360, his trade will be liquidated. Meanwhile, this risky bet comes as Bitcoin keeps testing $112,000. James Wynn( @JamesWynnReal ) is back again!

2025-07-10T14:21:32,"Open Interest in XRP Options Nears $100M as High Volatility Draws Yield Hunters","The dollar value locked in open XRP options contracts listed on Deribit is rapidly climbing to a record as the token's high implied volatility draws yield hunters. The so-called notional open interest (OI) has risen to nearly $98 million from $71 million since the June 27 quarterly expiry, a solid 38% rise in two weeks. It is now nearing the June 24 record of $102.3 million, according to data source Deribit Metrics . In contract terms, the OI has increased by 26% to 42,414. (The contract multiplier for XRP on Deribit is 1,000 XRP). Behind the increase is the token's implied volatility, a measure of expected price swings over a specific period. XRP's is higher than bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and solana (SOL), according to Lin Chen, Deribit's head of Asia business development. ""XRP has delivered an annual return of over 300% over the past 12 months,"" Chen told CoinDesk. ""Its options have also gained significant popularity, reflected in the highest implied volatility among major tokens — indicating strong investor demand."" One way traders are making gains is by selling cash-secured puts, Chen said. Writing a put option — agreeing to buy the asset at a set price — is akin to selling insurance against price drops in return for a premium, which represents the seller's return. Traders typically write options against holdings in the spot market or in a ""cash-secured"" way when the implied volatility is high. The higher the volatility, the costlier the options and vice versa. The cash-secured version involves holding enough stablecoins to ensure the underlying asset can be bought if the price slides and the put buyer decides to exercise their right to sell the asset at the predetermined price. Risk reversals are skewed bullish As of the time of writing, the 25-delta risk reversals were positive, indicating a bias toward call options, or bullish bets, according to data tracked by Amberdata. The 25-delta risk reversal is a strategy that comprises a long put position and a short call option (or vice versa) with a 25% delta, meaning both options are relatively far from the underlying asset's current market price. The pricing for risk reversals across tenors helps identify market sentiment, with positive values representing a relative richness of calls and negative values indicating a downside bias. At press time, short-term XRP risk reversals and those tied to August and September expiries were positive. Furthermore, more than 30 million calls were open, outstripping 11.92 million puts, giving a put-call ratio of 0.39, also a sign of bullish sentiment in the market.

According to an official announcement posted on Truth Social, users who subscribe to the $9.99 per month Patriot Package will access ultra-fast streaming of selected “non-woke” news channels, a red verification checkmark, improved comment visibility, and access to a Truth+ badge. Patriot package subscribers to earn tokens through rewards program Per Truth Social’s post, the loyalty package subscribers will be eligible to participate in a beta test that allows them to accumulate digital “gems” through platform engagement. The gems will eventually be tied to a utility token usable across Truth Social and its affiliated Truth+ media service. Truth social token announcement. Source: Truth Social Though still in beta, the company asserted that under the Patriot Package, the more active a user is on the platform, the more future tokens they will accrue. Oddly, despite its $9.99 monthly cost, the Patriot Package has fewer news channels than the platform’s free tier. The premium service includes 12 curated channels, while the no-cost plan includes 27, among them international broadcasters such as Euronews and a Spanish-language outlet. Truth social files for crypto ETF A fortnight before this token teaser, Truth Social had also filed an S-1 registration with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a new crypto exchange-traded fund, dubbed the “Truth Social Crypto Blue Chip ETF.” The filing proposes that the ETF’s assets will list Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Cronos (CRO). The preliminary allocation breakdown lists 70% in Bitcoin, 15% in Ethereum, 8% in Solana, 5% in Cronos, and 2% in Ripple. According to the prospectus, Yorkville America Digital is listed as the fund’s sponsor, while Foris DAX Trust Company will become the custodian of the digital assets. The ETF, if approved, is set to be offered on the New York Stock Exchange Arca. This application follows two prior filings by Truth Social, one for a standalone Bitcoin ETF in June and another combining both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Trump media’s previous crypto plans Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), Truth Social’s parent company, has been involved in several blockchain-based initiatives since Donald Trump returned to the Oval Office in January. In April, TMTG disclosed to shareholders that it was considering a utility token as part of a digital wallet solution. The wallet would allow users to pay for Truth+ subscriptions and other services within the Truth ecosystem. In May, the company denied the “unauthorized and misleading” rumors that it planned to launch a Truth Social-themed meme coin. Earlier in the year, Trump Media signed a binding agreement with exchange giant Crypto.com and asset management firm Yorkville America Digital to roll out several crypto-based ETFs under a “Made in America” branding umbrella. Trump’s financial ties to crypto continue Donald Trump and his family have formed a number of financial relationships in the crypto world, including one with Dubai-based Aqua 1 Foundation in June. Aqua 1 pledged a $100 million investment in World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a Web 3 firm tied to both Trump and real estate developer Steve Witkoff, the Middle East diplomatic envoy of the Trump administration. Under the agreement, Aqua 1 acquired $100 million worth of WLFI tokens. According to publicly disclosed terms, Trump personally receives 75% of all WLFI token sales, which could net him $75 million in revenue. The foundation was virtually unknown prior to the transaction, but now ranks among the largest contributors to Trump’s crypto-linked enterprises.

2025-07-10T14:00:09,"Bitcoin Is One Candle Away From $141,300 Breakout, Chart Master Warns","Top analyst Aksel Kibar (CMT) believes Bitcoin is approaching a decisive moment on the weekly chart. In a post shared on 9 July 2025, the veteran technician noted that BTC/USD is “holding right at the pattern boundary.” The annotated chart he released—covering Bitstamp weekly prices back to mid-2022—shows the cryptocurrency compressing directly beneath a horizontal resistance band at $109,000, the neckline of what he labels a six-month head-and-shoulders (H&S) continuation formation. Bitcoin Poised For $141,300 Kibar’s chart first revisits the basing sequence that reversed the 2022 bear cycle. A textbook inverse head-and-shoulders bottom completed in early-2023, with troughs at roughly $17,600 (left shoulder), $15,500 (head) and $19,500 (right shoulder). The breakout above the neckline sent Bitcoin to $31,400. Related Reading: Bitcoin & Stablecoin Reserves Diverge On Binance: Liquidity Explosion Brewing? Immediately thereafter, price stalled in a six-month rectangle bounded by $25,000 support and $31,400 resistance. The eventual topside resolution propelled the market to the rectangle’s implied target of $38,000, validating two consecutive classical projections in less than a year. Afterwards, the BTC price grinded higher. Below $73,700, BTC consolidated in a falling wedge, ending with a breakout toward $109,000. From that point, the initial pullback bottomed at $91,200, creating what Kibar designates as the left shoulder. A deeper descent to $76,500 carved out the head. Then, the Bitcoin price formed the right shoulder at $101,500, echoed by the blue bowl-shaped arc on the chart. Throughout this structure the neckline at $109,000 remained intact, acting as a clear demarcation between consolidation and fresh highs. The inverse head-and-shoulders pattern spans roughly half a year, matching the analyst’s “6-month-long” annotation. Related Reading: Last Time This Happened, Bitcoin Jumped $50,000—Is History Repeating? Using the orthodox H&S continuation rule—adding the vertical distance from the head ($73,700) to the neckline ($109,000) to the breakout level—Kibar derives a price objective of $141,300. He notes in an X reply that this target is separate from the earlier $137,000 objective, which came from a larger cup-with-handle on the monthly scale. In other words, the shorter-term weekly pattern now projects modestly higher than the longer-term structure. At press time Bitcoin, Bitcoin traded near $111,000, surpassing the neckline. However, from a technician’s standpoint, the breakout still needs to confirm with the weekly close. Confirmation requires a decisive weekly settlement north of the $109,000 neckline. As Kibar notes: “Breakout needs to take place with a long white candle, similar to previous pattern completions. There should be no hesitation.” Invalidation would emerge on a weekly close back below the most recent swing-low support at $101,500; deeper failure beneath $91,2000 would unravel the pattern entirely. For now, Bitcoin sits at the fulcrum of its six-month equilibrium. A weekly candle or two should reveal whether the largest digital asset can convert yet another classical chart formation into a measured move—this time toward mid-six-figure territory.

2025-07-10T14:00:08,"BlockDAG Hits $335M Presale as It Delivers Real Ecosystem While Bitcoin Pepe’s CEX Listing Shows What’s Next","Bitcoin Pepe is catching fresh attention as its centralized exchange (CEX) listing just wrapped up. Its presale crossed big milestones, fueling chatter in meme coin circles. The Bitcoin Pepe price keeps climbing as meme-powered energy builds in the community. It has all the signs of typical meme momentum: fast moves, social chatter, and a rush of short-term traders hoping for huge spikes. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) keeps stacking up real progress. Its ongoing presale has now raised over $335 million and isn’t just talking about plans; it’s putting out working tools, from its X1 mobile miner to low-code dev kits. In a crypto space crowded with empty promises, BlockDAG shows what actual delivery looks like. One project is pushing headlines. The other is setting new standards in blockchain. Bitcoin Pepe Faces Next Steps After CEX Listing The big Bitcoin Pepe CEX update went live on June 30, and the project is still working hard to stay visible. Its presale sparked plenty of interest, with the Bitcoin Pepe price moving up sharply and a meme-rich community plus staking perks pulling in fast-moving traders. Many are hoping to grab short-term profits from this fresh meme wave. The roadmap hints at token burns, listings, and community rewards to support growth later. But right now, the Bitcoin Pepe presale leans more on meme buzz than working features. There’s no live ecosystem yet, no real tools people can use. So this update could prove whether the excitement holds up after launch. The Bitcoin Pepe CEX update might be its chance to show it can back up the hype with real traction. BlockDAG Proves Tools, Miners, and Developer Community Work While Bitcoin Pepe talks up future updates, BlockDAG is already delivering at scale. It uses Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) tech to process thousands of transactions at once without slowing down like old blockchain chains do. This means it’s designed for efficiency and to handle growth smoothly. BlockDAG’s massive $335 million presale has powered actual releases. Its X1 Miner app is already in use by more than 2 million people, letting anyone mine up to 20 BDAG daily with no fancy gear. The working testnet supports smart contracts, DeFi tools, and bridges, all made easy with its low-code, no-code builder kits. Security is tight too. CertiK and Halborn have both reviewed its system, and its modular smart contracts mean quick upgrades when needed. The BlockDAG Academy and dev grants also pull in more builders daily. On the coin performance side, it’s still gaining ground. Early batches offered BDAG at a fraction of the price; those early users now see a 2,660% ROI from batch 1 to batch 29. The coin is set to launch at $0.05, but right now, it’s open for just $0.0016 until August 11. That means anyone who grabs it now could see a 3,025% gain at launch if all goes as planned. So while Bitcoin Pepe rides hype, BlockDAG shows how real blockchain delivery works. Bitcoin Pepe vs BlockDAG Short-Term Play or Real Ecosystem The Bitcoin Pepe price chart and recent CEX listing keep people excited. That June 30 moment was a big test. But just riding big moves doesn’t always mean long-term results. BlockDAG stands as a real example of how blockchain should look when it’s actually live. From a working miner app to testnet tools, real audits, and a growing community of builders, it’s not just hype, it’s real traction. Where Bitcoin Pepe gives meme vibes, BlockDAG builds systems. Short-term traders may run to Bitcoin Pepe, but those wanting something that can scale and deliver are picking BlockDAG instead. The Bottom Line Bitcoin Pepe has caught a lot of eyes with its presale hype and its recent June 30 CEX launch. The price action and meme factor have pulled in people who love the thrill of quick moves. Now that the listing is live, it might spike, but what happens when the early excitement fades? This is where BlockDAG clearly leads. Its presale has already crossed $335 million, the X1 mobile miner is live, and its smart contracts and dev tools are working today, not tomorrow. While Bitcoin Pepe stays in the spotlight for its hype, BlockDAG keeps delivering substance and an ecosystem built for the long haul. Anyone watching for real progress, daily use, and growth that goes beyond memes is keeping an eye on BlockDAG. It’s not just another promise, it’s a blockchain built to last.

2025-07-10T14:00:00,"Skyline announces wrapped cAP3X token launch on Cardano","Blockchain developer Skyline has announced plans to deploy cAP3X, a wrapped AP3X token, on the Cardano blockchain , according to the information shared with Finbold on July 10. The launch, developed in collaboration with the Apex Fusion Foundation, will create a Cardano-native asset that provides access to the Apex Fusion ecosystem. The wrapped utility token will operate natively on Cardano ( ADA ), enabling interoperability between the Cardano and Apex Fusion networks. Users will be able to engage in cross-chain value transfers between the two blockchain ecosystems. Token integration and trading The cAP3X token will be compatible with Cardano wallets and DeFi protocols, with plans to establish an ADA/cAP3X trading pair and provide initial liquidity for Cardano-based decentralized exchanges. After deployment in July, users can transfer cAP3X from Cardano to PRIME Chain, Apex Fusion’s UTXO Layer 1 blockchain, using the Skyline Bridge. Once bridged to PRIME, cAP3X converts to native AP3X at a 1:1 ratio for use across Apex Fusion protocols. Staking rewards The native AP3X tokens on PRIME Chain can be staked in Apex staking pools, offering up to 10% APY rewards through liquid staking mechanisms currently active on the network. PRIME Chain combines Bitcoin’s UTXO security model with Ethereum’s ( ETH ) smart contract functionality, utilizing the Ouroboros consensus mechanism for staking operations. The network aims to address blockchain fragmentation by integrating existing networks. Following the token deployment and liquidity setup, bridge activation and staking features will become available on PRIME Chain. Technical documentation and integration guides will be released prior to the wrapped token launch to support developers and users. Featured image via Shutterstock.

The VC fund and gaming startup will contribute up to $100M for its treasury strategy. Anomica Brands struck a partnership with DDC Enterprise, with the goal of injecting $100M for BTC treasury expansion. With this move, Animoca Brands shifts its attention from Web3 startups and games, aiming to allocate a part of its assets back to BTC. So far, Animoca Brands has raised $825.9M, which have been used for its own games, as well as for startups. The company started its fundraising efforts in 2015, and continued through several bull markets, building up a significant ETH and BTC treasury. The exact BTC holdings are not specified, but the company has an extensive crypto portfolio, accrued over the years. “ Our partnership with DDC enables Animoca Brands to enhance the value of our blockchain technologies and maximize the value of our Bitcoin holdings,” added Yat Siu, co-founder and executive chairman of Animoca Brands. Animoca Brands joined the BTC treasury trend after slowing down its VC investments into riskier early-stage projects. Animoca Brands to advice on BTC yield strategies DDC Enterprise Limited (DDC) signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding with Animoca Brands. The fund will help DDC to develop and implement yield strategy for the current BTC treasury. Animoca Brands will extend help and allocate up to $100M in BTC toward yield enhancement strategies operated by DDC. The move will accelerate the DDC accumulation strategy, in addition to its recent $528M financing package. The fundraising is split between PIPE raises, a $300M convertible note, $200M equity line, and a $2M equity private placement. Yat Siu, the co-founder and executive chairman of Animoca Brands, will join DDC’s Bitcoin Visionary Council, providing guidance on the company’s Bitcoin treasury operations. DDC has a relatively small treasury of 138 BTC, starting out in May this year. The company’s BTC treasury is part of the latest wave of companies pivoting into BTC and planning larger purchases with the help of credit facilities. Animoca Brands is also involved with DigitalX, an Australian treasury company. The fund invested just $20.7M into DigitalX, as a precursor to its largest deal to date. DDC trades near a six-month high DDC is one of the treasury companies that benefitted from its BTC purchases in the short term. The stock is trading near its highest level for the year to date period, recovering to $11. However, DDC is still far from its peak from November 2023, when the stock traded above $155. Unlike other treasury companies, DDC will continue expanding its food business, retaining BTC as its core reserve asset. DDC has promised an aggressive accumulation strategy, while still retaining a portfolio of food brands. Despite the sliding stock price, the DDC portfolio of brands is on the verge of being cash-positive, making for a viable combination of real-world business and a BTC treasury. Previously, DDC has stated it intends to build a treasury of 5,000 BTC, turning into a medium-sized corporate holder. The company is one of the first to mix financing deals for acquiring BTC, while tapping a partner that may have coins on hand for an OTC deal. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

After closing 0.6% higher on Wednesday, the S&P 500 opened near the flatline and is hugging its record high zone. The S&P 500, the benchmark index, was up 0.06%, benefiting from the upbeat sentiment around Nvidia (NVDA), a company that has rode the overall bullish outlook for stocks to storm to the $4 trillion valuation.

The AI chipmaker’s stock closed 1.8% higher on July 9, 2025, trading at $162 and helping the Nasdaq Composite hit a new record high . Comparatively, the S&P 500 has advanced 6.7% year-to-date and 96% in the past five years. Investor focus will be on the next moves on the tariffs front, particularly around deals with U.S. trade partners China, the United Kingdom, India, and the European Union. Trump has also threatened an additional 10% tariff on BRICS countries. Also attracting market attention will be U.S. weekly jobless claims and the Federal Reserve’s next move regarding interest rates. Positive news around these factors may help dilute any potential headwinds from the global trade war.

2025-07-10T13:31:39,"Bitcoin could reach between $250,000 and $350,000","Bitcoin’s price is seen as a market bellwether. Analyst Matthew (@OneBasedMoney) suggests it follows a power law model , doubling roughly every 12.7% of its lifespan—indicating exponential, not linear, growth. Currently, Bitcoin is in a quiet phase, often a precursor to major bullish runs. Macro Outlook & Scarcity Matthew compares Bitcoin to fiat money supply (~$26T), which is expected to rise due to future monetary easing. As fiat is devalued, scarce assets like Bitcoin (21M cap) become more attractive, reinforcing its role as a hedge against inflation. Price Target: $250K–$350K by End of 2025 Based on his model, Bitcoin could reach $250,000–$350,000 by late 2025 / early 2026 , aligning with previous cycle peaks. Matthew believes Bitcoin’s value is now driven 95% by internal adoption trends—not macro events—highlighting a maturing market led by users, tech, and institutions. Final Surge Likely While long-term growth may slow, a euphoric end-of-cycle rally remains probable, fueled by rising spot ETF interest and institutional flows. However, questions linger about Bitcoin’s role as fiat expands and markets evolve. Conclusion: Bullish Outlook Despite uncertainties, Bitcoin’s fundamentals—fixed supply, growing adoption, and institutional interest—support a strong bullish case.

2025-07-10T13:20:11,"Bitcoin’s Explosive Surge: Unlocking the $133K Potential by September","Are you ready for a potential seismic shift in the crypto landscape? The world of digital assets is abuzz with a bold Bitcoin price prediction that could see the leading cryptocurrency reach an astonishing $133,000 by September. This isn’t just wishful thinking; it’s a meticulously crafted forecast from a respected crypto market research firm, 10x Research, that has caught the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike. If you’ve been tracking Bitcoin’s journey, this latest analysis offers a compelling reason to pay closer attention. What’s Fueling This Bold Bitcoin Price Prediction? The latest bullish sentiment surrounding Bitcoin stems directly from insights provided by Markus Thielen, a prominent analyst at 10x Research. According to Cointelegraph, Thielen’s firm has identified a significant shift in their internal trend model. On June 29, this model officially turned bullish, signaling a strong probability of continued upside momentum for Bitcoin over the next two months. This isn’t just a hunch; it’s a data-driven assessment that assigns a substantial 60% probability to this upward trajectory. Thielen emphasizes that historical trends often provide a reliable compass for future price movements. Based on current levels near $111,000, a 20% gain, as suggested by historical patterns, would indeed propel BTC to the $133,000 mark. While the third quarter (Q3) of the year has historically been a weaker period for Bitcoin, Thielen believes that the current cycle possesses unique characteristics that could defy this established trend. This defiance could be attributed to a confluence of factors, including renewed institutional interest and evolving macroeconomic conditions that favor digital assets. Decoding the BTC Market Analysis: Beyond the Numbers To truly appreciate the significance of 10x Research’s forecast, it’s essential to delve deeper into the broader BTC market analysis . The prediction isn’t isolated; it’s part of a complex interplay of on-chain data, derivatives market activity, and macroeconomic indicators. One of the key drivers cited is the robust demand for call options. But what does this mean, and why is it so important? Understanding Bitcoin Call Options: What they are: Call options give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy an asset (in this case, Bitcoin) at a specified price (the strike price) on or before a certain date. Why strong demand is bullish: High demand for call options, especially those with higher strike prices, indicates that a significant number of market participants anticipate a substantial price increase. They are willing to pay a premium for the potential to profit from future upside. Market sentiment indicator: This demand acts as a strong indicator of bullish sentiment among sophisticated traders and institutional players who use derivatives for hedging or speculative purposes. Furthermore, the market’s current structure, particularly in the derivatives space, suggests a leaning towards bullish outcomes. Traders are positioning themselves for upward movement, which can create a self-fulfilling prophecy to some extent, as positive sentiment attracts more capital. Navigating Current Crypto Market Trends and Their Impact The bullish outlook for Bitcoin isn’t happening in a vacuum. It’s intrinsically linked to the broader crypto market trends that have been shaping the digital asset landscape. Several factors are converging to create a fertile ground for potential price appreciation: Key Drivers Influencing Bitcoin’s Trajectory: Factor Description Impact on Bitcoin Institutional Adoption Continued inflow into spot Bitcoin ETFs, indicating growing acceptance from traditional finance. Increases demand, provides regulatory clarity, and adds legitimacy to Bitcoin as an asset class. Halving Event Aftermath The supply shock from the recent Bitcoin halving is gradually manifesting in reduced selling pressure from miners. Creates a scarcity effect, historically leading to significant price rallies in the months following the event. Macroeconomic Environment Potential shifts in interest rate policies, inflation concerns, and global economic stability. Bitcoin can act as a hedge against inflation or a safe haven asset during economic uncertainty, attracting capital. Technological Advancements Ongoing development within the Bitcoin ecosystem (e.g., Lightning Network, Ordinals) enhancing utility and adoption. Improves scalability, reduces transaction costs, and broadens Bitcoin’s use cases, making it more attractive. The narrative around Bitcoin is evolving from a speculative asset to a legitimate component of diversified investment portfolios. This shift is crucial for sustained growth and attracting larger pools of capital, which can certainly contribute to the kind of upward movement predicted by 10x Research. The Strategic Importance of Bitcoin Call Options for Market Momentum The emphasis on strong demand for Bitcoin call options by Markus Thielen is not just a passing comment; it’s a critical piece of the puzzle for understanding the current market dynamics. Call options are powerful tools in the derivatives market, and their heightened activity signals a sophisticated positioning by large investors. When institutions and whales purchase significant volumes of call options, especially out-of-the-money (OTM) calls (options with strike prices higher than the current market price), it indicates a strong belief that the underlying asset’s price will rise substantially before the option expires. This creates a positive feedback loop: Increased open interest: More call options being held suggests a collective bullish bet. Dealer hedging: Option sellers (dealers) often hedge their positions by buying the underlying asset (Bitcoin) as the price approaches the strike price. This hedging activity itself can contribute to upward price pressure. Market sentiment amplification: The visible demand for calls can inspire confidence among other market participants, leading to further buying. This confluence of factors, driven by the strategic use of derivatives, adds a layer of robustness to the prediction. It’s not merely based on technical chart patterns but also on the positioning of significant capital within the market. Insights from 10x Research Outlook: What Does It Mean for Your Portfolio? The 10x Research outlook presents an exciting prospect for Bitcoin investors, but it’s crucial to approach such predictions with a balanced perspective. While the $133,000 target by September is compelling, it’s essential to consider both the potential benefits and inherent challenges. Benefits of a Bullish Outlook: Significant Capital Appreciation: For current holders, a move to $133,000 represents substantial gains, validating long-term conviction in Bitcoin. Increased Market Confidence: A strong rally can attract new investors and re-engage dormant ones, further strengthening the overall crypto market. Positive Ecosystem Impact: A rising Bitcoin price often pulls altcoins higher, benefiting the broader digital asset ecosystem. Potential Challenges and Risks: Market Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its dramatic price swings. While the prediction is bullish, sharp corrections can occur. Analyst Predictions Are Not Guarantees: While 10x Research is reputable, market forecasts are inherently speculative and subject to unforeseen events. Macroeconomic Headwinds: Unexpected global economic downturns, regulatory crackdowns, or geopolitical conflicts could derail even the most optimistic forecasts. Profit-Taking: As Bitcoin approaches significant price targets, some investors may opt to take profits, leading to temporary pullbacks. Actionable Insights for Investors: Given this optimistic yet cautious outlook, what should investors consider? Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always verify information and understand the underlying factors driving any prediction. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders or using dollar-cost averaging to mitigate risk. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: While a September target is short-term, Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition remains a key consideration for many investors. Diversification: While Bitcoin may be a strong performer, a diversified portfolio across various assets can help manage risk. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news, regulatory developments, and on-chain metrics that can influence Bitcoin’s price. The current market sentiment, bolstered by the analysis from 10x Research, paints a promising picture for Bitcoin’s near future. The confluence of a bullish trend model, strong demand for call options, and supportive macroeconomic factors suggests that Bitcoin could indeed be poised for a significant upward movement. A September Surge on the Horizon? The prospect of Bitcoin hitting $133,000 by September, as projected by 10x Research, injects a fresh wave of excitement and optimism into the crypto market. Markus Thielen’s analysis, grounded in a bullish trend model and robust demand for Bitcoin call options, offers a compelling narrative for the coming months. While Q3 has historically been a quieter period for Bitcoin, this cycle appears to be charting a different course, potentially defying past trends due to strong underlying fundamentals and evolving market dynamics. As always, the crypto market remains dynamic and unpredictable, but the signals from 10x Research provide a powerful indicator that Bitcoin’s journey towards new highs may just be getting started. For those tracking the digital gold, the next few months promise to be exceptionally interesting.

2025-07-10T13:19:10,"Bitcoin price analysis after hitting new all-time high: further gains or return to range lows?","Bitcoin has surged into major resistance at $111,250 after a bullish expansion. Without volume confirmation, price risks rejection and another rotation back toward range lows near $98,270. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is once again confronting a critical decision point as price trades into a long-standing high time frame resistance zone around $111,250. This level marks the current range high and has historically served as a ceiling for price action. Following a sharp bullish reaction from the value area high, BTC has made a strong push upward, but without sustained volume, the risk of rejection remains. Whether this area is broken with conviction or rejected again will likely dictate Bitcoin’s directional trend in the coming weeks and months. Key technical points Resistance at $111,250: High time frame range top and key structural level. Bullish Reaction from Value Area High: Recent breakout was aggressive but lacks sustained volume. Still Range-Bound: Between $111,250 resistance and $98,270 support. BTCUSD (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has posted a bullish expansion, lifting off from the value area high and surging into high time frame resistance. The level at $111,250 is not a random price zone, it marks a critical structural resistance that has capped prior attempts at higher prices. Structurally, Bitcoin remains within a wide trading range, with historical rejections from both the range high and range low resulting in full oscillations between the two extremes. You might also like: Australia begins second phase of tokenized asset and CBDC settlement trials with major banks Despite the strength of the recent move, price has not yet confirmed a true breakout. A decisive breakout would require strong candle closures above resistance and, most importantly, sustained volume influx. So far, this has not occurred, leaving the door open to a liquidity grab scenario, where stop orders from short sellers are triggered just before price stalls and reverses. If Bitcoin fails to push through $111,250 with volume-backed momentum, the likelihood of a range continuation increases. This would open the probability for a rotation back toward the lower boundary of the range, near $98,270, where resting liquidity remains uncollected. Such moves are typical in high time frame consolidations, where price oscillates between known liquidity zones until a true breakout or breakdown occurs. Until a clear breakout confirms the change in structure, Bitcoin remains technically range-bound, and caution is warranted. Price is at resistance, and without bullish follow-through, the probability favors another leg down within the existing range. What to expect in the coming price action If Bitcoin fails to break above $111,250 with conviction and volume, expect a rotation lower toward $98,270. A breakout with strong volume, however, could trigger a new all-time high attempt.

2025-07-10T00:05:02,"RBA advances wholesale CBDC trials with industry partners","<p>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) announced on Thursday a significant step forward in developing a wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC), launching “Project Acacia” in collaboration with industry partners. The initiative will test 19 pilot programs using real money and assets for the first time, alongside five proof-of-concept trials involving simulated transactions.</p><p>The trials span various asset classes, including fixed income, private markets, trade receivables, and carbon credits. Settlement methods will explore CBDCs, stablecoins, bank deposit tokens, and innovative applications of existing commercial bank deposits held at the RBA. Testing will occur over the next six months using platforms such as Hedera, Redbelly, R3 Corda, and Canvas Connect, with a final report expected in the first half of 2026.</p><p>RBA Assistant Governor Brad Jones said the selected use cases will help assess how both central bank and private digital money, alongside payments infrastructure, could enhance Australia's wholesale financial markets. The RBA remains focused on wholesale applications, having found limited economic justification for a retail digital currency. Expected benefits include lower risks, improved transparency, better collateral efficiency, and cost reductions.</p>
