2025-06-10T04:48:57,"Signs of Accumulation Emerge as Bitcoin (BTC) Shipped to $110K","Bitcoin broke above $107,000 on Monday in a notable respite and kept climbing to $110,500 on Tuesday morning, following last week’s turbulence sparked by the Trump-Musk fallout. The latest on-chain data now suggests that the crypto asset may be preparing for its next upward move, as several key indicators reflect growing bullish sentiment. Bitcoin Demand Strengthens According to CryptoQuant’s latest update , one of the primary signals comes from Binance’s Taker Buy/Sell Ratio, a metric that measures the volume of market buy orders relative to market sell orders. The metric has recently surged to 1.1, which means that traders on Binance are showing significantly more buying aggression than selling. Historically, values above 1 tend to reflect a shift toward increased demand and bullish market behavior. Another supportive indicator is the 90-day Buy/Sell Pressure Delta, which is climbing toward previous historical peaks of around 0.02. This delta represents the net accumulation behavior across the market. Although the current level is not yet excessive, it suggests sustained accumulation without signs of overheating. This environment could be conducive to gradual price expansion. Re-Accumulation Phase Bitcoin’s price has broken above the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) 1-day to 1-week band. This band tracks coins moved within the last week, and its breakout indicates that newer coins are now in profit and are being held rather than sold off. Such breakouts have previously preceded transitions from distribution to re-accumulation phases, and often indicated that a newer cohort of investors is entering the market with strong holding conviction. Further validating this narrative is the rise in the Realized Cap held by long-term holders (LTH), which has now surpassed $56 billion. This suggests that coins are increasingly moving into wallets that have historically held assets for over 155 days, which reflects a general lack of intent to sell. These wallets tend to represent “smart money” that accumulates rather than exits during bullish phases. Considering all these factors together, the data reflects a market that is neither in euphoria nor fear, but showing clear signs of strengthening fundamentals and increasing investor confidence, which could point to the possibility of Bitcoin’s next leg higher, despite June jitters .

2025-06-10T04:48:48,"Bitcoin Rebounds to $108K as Short Squeeze and FOMO Drive Monday Surge","The renewed energy in the markets at the week’s start has carried over nicely into the cryptocurrency space, with Bitcoin—BTC —making a dramatic return to the $108,000 level as we now head toward the weekend. Just four days ago, BTC was on the edge of dipping below the less-than-psychological $100,000 threshold. Retail traders in the space had been FOMOing heavily into Bitcoin, which had pushed its price so high that some were starting to call it a bubble. Panic selling in these same retail traders pulled the market downward, but now we are back on the way up. The price of Bitcoin surged from 105,000 dollars to 107,000 in a matter of hours on Monday, before further increasing to touch 108,000 dollars. The move, of course, came as a pleasant surprise to holders, but it was also something of a relief to soured market sentiment, which, only weeks earlier, had taken the nascent industry to new depths of despair. Monday’s surge led some observers to hypothesize about the return of a bull market, even if others pointed wryly to the nature of Bitcoin’s recent trading and the kinds of things that are often said before a major price drop. Monday has kicked off with a bang for crypto traders, as Bitcoin has quickly returned to $108K. After threatening to fall below $100K just 4 days ago, retail traders panic sold. Now, they are showing signs of flooding back in with the 2nd largest spike in FOMO in the past 2… pic.twitter.com/ZlPvHy8CGg — Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 9, 2025 Short Liquidations Spark Rally The most recent surge in the market seems to have been generated by overzealous short sellers being forced to cover their positions. One measurable effect of this was seen between 1 and 5 PM, on a Monday afternoon, when total liquidations of short positions jumped from $105,000 to $359,000. Rising prices were clearly doing their job, but it is also possible that some market orders had hit certain key price levels, generating an uptick in price behavior that even more short sellers wanted to stay away from. All in all, something like $250 million worth of short positions were liquidated during this time. $BTC jumped from $105K to $107K today – likely fuelled by a wave of short liquidations. Over just 4 hours, total short liquidations spiked from $105K to $359K (24H SMA). Last week’s negative funding rates had pointed to rising short appetite, and today, those bets got squeezed. pic.twitter.com/TMkdyXjOUZ — glassnode (@glassnode) June 9, 2025 In the week leading up to today, the funding rates across the main derivatives exchanges swung negative and maintained that position. This was a clear signal that traders were heavily shorting Bitcoin. And when a trading environment is heavily short, it becomes increasingly ripe for a short squeeze, which is when the price unexpectedly moves upward and forces traders who are short (betting that the price will go down) to the buy side in order to cover their now losing position. Although rapid upward price spikes can result from a short squeeze, they are not necessarily long-lasting. Traders now must watch for sustained follow-through volume and for new buying pressure—especially from institutional investors—to step in and support these elevated price levels. Retail Sentiment Turns Euphoric Once Again Retail-driven enthusiasm is surging again, as seen on social media where the FOMO meter is registering its second-largest spike in the past two weeks. This is bringing previously sidelined retail investors back into the market. It is almost hard to believe after the plunge seen just days ago when Bitcoin was at a sub-$100,000 breakdown level, but this enthusiasm is the real deal. In the past, Bitcoin has had a tendency to move in the opposite direction of extreme retail sentiment. When FOMO (fear of missing out) reaches its highest levels, it coincides with local tops for Bitcoin. Likewise, when the crowd is in a state of capitulation (when everyone is throwing in the towel), it has frequently marked a bottom for Bitcoin. This sentiment dynamic is particularly intense in crypto, where price action is often driven by psychological and behavioral patterns. Particularly, social media has turned out to be a counter-indicator of sorts. When it is retail traders who are dominating the platforms, it is also the same time that experienced market participants are reducing their exposure. Given the intensity of today’s surge in retail sentiment, the next 24-48 hours should tell us a lot about the duration and sustainability of this current rally. #Bitcoin spot ETFs saw net outflows of -4.6K $BTC last week – first negative week in 8. Total holdings are now 1.20M #BTC , down ~11.5K #BTC from the late-May peak. A pause in demand after a strong run-up – watch for signs of re-acceleration. pic.twitter.com/TCVz5sL65Z — glassnode (@glassnode) June 9, 2025 ETF Outflows Raise Questions About Institutional Appetite Although captivated by recent short-term price movements, traders should also be mindful of emerging signs indicating a slowdown in institutional demand. Last week, Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced net outflows of 4,600 BTC; that marks the first negative week for ETFs in eight. Total ETF holdings now stand at approximately 1.20 million BTC. They are down roughly 11,500 BTC from their peak in late May. Institutional investors might be either taking profits or pausing to reassess after the recent strong run-up of several months in that they might be either taking profits or pausing to reassess after the recent strong run-up of several months in that they might be either taking profits or pausing to reassess. Signs of renewed ETF inflows would be clear evidence of continued institutional interest and, we think, could act as a strong confirmation of the more than just technically squeezed recent rally. At present, the market is experiencing a degree of optimism because of Monday’s rebound. But as always in the world of cryptocurrency, volatility is at a peak, sentiment is changeable, and the next big market move could come just as fast as the last one.

2025-06-10T04:46:59,"Ethereum ETFs Draw Nearly $843M in Inflows as Institutional Momentum Builds","Ethereum is once more under the market’s focus and the crypto spotlight. It seems to be back. And it’s not just Bitcoin . Traditional finance investing and capital is flowing into Ethereum as well. The last four weeks alone have seen American spot ETFs for Ethereum receive $842.9 million in new capital. With fidelity from spiritual-quality companies like BlackRock and Fidelity, the Ethereum capital inflow seems not just steady but increasing. From April 9 to now, ETH has gained ~69%, easily pushing through several layers of resistance and renewing investor optimism about a fresh macro rally. $ETH ETF INFLOWS DON'T LIE In just 4 weeks, U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs have seen $842.9M in net inflows, a tidal wave of institutional capital that’s helping push ETH up 69% since April 9th! Big money is here, and they’re not just dipping their toes, they’re diving in.… pic.twitter.com/XNelyZCvuz — ethereum.network (@EthereumNetw) June 9, 2025 Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum is moving toward not just institutional but regulatory demand for what is becoming a more critically accepted layer of digital infrastructure. Near-future economic models for Ethereum are projected to be a lot healthier. Scalable platform means no congestion in the system regardless of volume of transactions, and that no systematic collapse of fees. Above all, Dapp (decentralized App) leads to DTV (decentralized transaction vehicle)/DTP (decentralized trading platform). No collapse model means anything from three-fifths to six-tenths of ETH hitting the market as profits over the next 36 months. And the Dapp takes further advantage of the Ethereum blockchain. Wall Street Goes All-In: Ethereum ETF Inflows Paint a Bullish Picture Over the past month, the spot Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. have seen astonishing inflows that very clearly indicate the growing confidence of structures in the Ethereum network as a solid investment vehicle. These investment structures have now pulled in nearly $843 million. That’s coming from vehicles that only exist because the SEC has finally pulled its head out of the sand and approved them after many, many months of seemingly endless regulatory scrutiny. This seems to be a strategic rather than a speculative investment. Institutional investors aren’t chasing after short-term profits like retail investors; they’re taking positions for the long haul. This isn’t a temporary upsurge in interest; it’s a deliberate move. For a number of institutional investors, Ethereum is a lot more than a cryptocurrency: it’s the infrastructure the decentralized future is being built on, with applications in finance, identity, and gaming, not to mention the real-world assets that humanity plays around with. The recent influx of interest from institutions is also being given a lot of the fresh credit for ETH’s recent price movement. Since early April, Ethereum has soared nearly 70%, a rally that pretty much coincides with the incoming ETF inflow trend. This participation and the capital size really involved suggest that Ethereum is no longer living only in the native crypto neighborhood. It’s now part of the broader financial world. Ethereum L2 transaction fees are rapidly declining. In the last 30 days: •⁠ ⁠Base: 66 $ETH (-34,8%) •⁠ ⁠⁠World Chain: 33 $ETH (-64,5%) •⁠ ⁠Arbitrum: 20 $ETH (-84,5%) •⁠ ⁠OP: 12 $ETH (-68,5%) •⁠ ⁠Polygon: 7,5 $ETH (-78,6%) Fees are trending toward zero.… pic.twitter.com/iddTtMMEo7 — Ted (@TedPillows) June 9, 2025 Ethereum Layer 2s Slash Fees, Reinforcing Long-Term Utility Even though mainstream adoption brings external affirmation, the real reason to be excited about Ethereum is how incredibly well it works as a piece of technology. Take the Layer 2 “rollup” networks that sit on top of Ethereum and promise to scale it. To give an idea of how far we have come, over the course of December and January, the costs to users for operating their rollup networks went down by an average of 300%. That is absolutely insane. And again, it is not something that went down by 50% over a couple of weeks and we all hope it comes back up. This went down by 300% and is something that we expect to happen again, in a well-mapped-out, planned, and in many cases, already implemented way. More on this in a bit. Over the past month, quite a few prominent Layer-2 chains registered some substantial reductions in Ethereum fees. To be precise, the following five, which are some of the biggest L2 chains, reported the following reductions: – Base: Recorded 66 ETH in fees, down 34.8%. – World Layer: Reported 33 ETH in fees, down 64.5%. – Arbitrum: Registered a much more substantial reduction with fees falling to 20 ETH, marking an 84.5% drop since last month. – Optimism: Reported a smaller, but still notable, reduction ending up with 12 ETH in fees, down 68.5%. – Polygon: Registered 7.5 ETH in fees, down 78.6%. This data makes one thing very clear—transaction costs across the ecosystem are falling. And they are falling fast, not by chance but by design. Ethereum’s roadmap gives pride of place to not just scalability but also efficiency, and the reduction in fees we’re seeing now seems to point to the growing effectiveness of that strategy. You could argue that as fees decrease, the yield rises on the usability of the network. And increased usability (which must also not come at the cost of security) is a gateway to Ethereum’s interaction with the masses. Ethereum is becoming cost-effective. It is becoming accessible. It is becoming useful. And like any infrastructure, those three things are absolutely vital if you want people to build on top of/within said infrastructure. Is This the Beginning of Ethereum’s Next Macro Rally? With a combination of price and fundamental momentum, Ethereum seems to be at the early stages of the next major market cycle. The forces of both institutional capital and tech are consolidating and fusing around the asset. Like a train coming into the station, Ethereum is regaining not only its market position but also new legitimacy as an asset class. We see not only tech but also established financial institutions rallying around ETH. What sets this rally apart from the previous ones is its foundation. Instead of being propelled mainly by retail speculation, the present rise of Ethereum is supported by long-term investment, structural enhancements, and a future in which Ethereum is likely to be scalable. The coming together of lower fees, a surge in ETF demand, and infrastructure upgrades points toward an Ethereum ecosystem that seems more mature and resilient. Should Ethereum persist as scalable and cost-efficient infrastructure, attracting more and more institutional investment, this might be more than just a run-up. It might well be a foundational chapter in the ongoing story of Ethereum as a next-generation global economic layer. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

2025-06-10T04:26:45,"Bitcoin exchange reserves dry up as BTC price approaches $110K — is a new ATH on the horizon?","Bitcoin surged roughly 3.8% over the past 24 hours, briefly breaking above the $110,000 mark before settling around $109,600 by Tuesday morning Asian hours. This move marks Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) strongest performance in June so far, reversing last week’s drop that saw the asset dip near $100,000. The price now sits just 3% below its all-time high. Behind this latest rally is a mix trading activity, on-chain signals, and macro developments. According to Coinglass data , nearly $203 million in positions were liquidated in the Bitcoin market over the past day. Of that, $195 million were shorts, highlighting the strength of upward momentum. Meanwhile, derivatives volume more than doubled, rising 113% to $110.63 billion. Open interest also grew by 7.3% to $76.6 billion, showing fresh capital entering the market as traders repositioned. A key external driver appears to be easing tensions between the U.S. and China. Trade negotiations resumed in London on June 9, with hopes of a deal that could reduce tariffs and lighten export restrictions. Market sentiment improved as talks got underway, which raised demand for riskier assets like Bitcoin. But beyond the headlines, the real story may lie in what’s happening on-chain. According to a June 10 post by CryptoQuant contributor BaykusCharts, Bitcoin reserves on centralized exchanges have dropped from 1.55 million in July 2024 to just 1.01 million BTC today. That’s a reduction of 550,000 coins in under a year. You might also like: https://crypto.news/interview-bitcoin-price-target-hinges-on-fed-pivot-and-etf-flows-bitunix-analyst/ This kind of steady withdrawal indicates long-term holding. As more Bitcoin leaves exchanges, available supply shrinks. If demand rises at the same time, as it appears to be, prices typically move up. The pattern is consistent with the notion that Bitcoin is no longer viewed as a trading asset but as digital gold. Further data indicates that U.S. investors’ demand is increasing. The “Coinbase Premium” indicator from CryptoQuant shows that Americans are paying more to purchase Bitcoin, a pattern frequently observed during the accumulation stages. Whale activity is also increasing, according to Santiment, with renewed accumulation seen across wallet sizes, especially among those holding between 10 and 100 BTC. There remains some caution though. Bitcoin is still correlated to the larger equity market, which could limit short-term gains if macro headwinds reappear. Furthermore, traders cite futures data as evidence that not everyone is certain of a breakout. Rather than long-term conviction, short-term speculation or hedging may have contributed significantly to the recent volume. Traders are still placing bets in both directions and while liquidations heavily leaned against shorts, such volatility often indicates indecision . In these conditions, it only takes a modest reversal or macro shock to shake weak hands out of the market. Even so, the mood is turning optimistic. Many analysts are already calling for new all-time highs in the coming days, some even eyeing $150,000 by the end of , especially if U.S. debt levels keep climbing.

Andrew Small, a former economic crime investigator with the police, will lead the charge as crypto ownership becomes increasingly common in insolvency proceedings. His appointment reflects a sharp rise in the number and value of crypto-related cases over the past five years. In 2024–25, the agency identified over £520,000 (about $660,000) worth of crypto assets across 59 insolvency cases, up from just £1,436 (around $1,820) in 14 cases in 2019–20.

With more than 7m UK adults now holding some form of cryptocurrency , according to the Financial Conduct Authority, digital assets are becoming a key part of the personal finance landscape. As a result, they are also showing up more frequently in bankruptcy and fraud investigations. Small will operate within the Insolvency Service’s Investigation and Enforcement Services team, focusing primarily on criminal cases. He is expected to provide frontline investigators with technical guidance on how digital assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and NFTs are stored, traded, and concealed. “There has been a rapid rise in crypto ownership in the UK, and alongside that, we’ve seen a similar rise in cryptoasset ownership in bankruptcy cases,” said Small. “My role will help the agency by providing specialist knowledge about the types of cryptoassets available and the associated technology used to buy, sell and store them.” New Crypto Role Aims to Close Gaps in UK Asset Recovery Framework The appointment is expected to have a significant impact on crypto seizures, particularly Bitcoin. As the agency strengthens its ability to detect and recover digital assets, individuals and companies facing insolvency or criminal investigations will find it increasingly difficult to hide wealth in cryptocurrencies. For those attempting to use crypto as a shield, the risks of detection and seizure are now markedly higher. Officials say the new role is a critical part of returning more value to creditors. The agency’s expanding mandate includes tracing assets, as well as recovering them on behalf of creditors. Neil Freebury, head of intelligence at the Insolvency Service, said the growing complexity of asset holdings made it essential to bring in experts. “Andrew brings a wealth of knowledge to this role,” he noted, adding that his background would strengthen the agency’s ability to deal with crypto-heavy cases. The appointment signals a more aggressive and informed approach to digital asset enforcement in the UK, at a time when regulators and courts globally are grappling with the challenges of decentralized finance.

2025-06-10T03:52:26,"BIP177 và cuộc tranh cãi về cái tên Bitcoin?","Cuộc tranh luận lâu năm về việc đặt tên gọi Bitcoin cho số đơn vị sau dấu thập phân phần nào phản ánh mâu thuẫn giữa truyền thống và tính tiện dụng của Bitcoin trong đời sống. Một đề xuất nổi bật là loại bỏ dấu thập phân và dùng “bitcoin” (số nhiều) làm đơn vị nhỏ nhất thay vì satoshi. Dù satoshi đã trở nên phổ biến, một số người cho rằng “bit” – bằng 100 satoshi – sẽ thân thiện hơn với người dùng đại chúng, đặc biệt khi giá Bitcoin tăng cao. Gần đây, BIP 177 – do John Carvalho (CEO Synonym) đề xuất – đã làm nóng cuộc tranh luận. BIP 177 muốn bỏ hoàn toàn dấu thập phân và dùng “bitcoin” làm đơn vị hiển thị mặc định. Tuy nhiên, giống như các nâng cấp trước đó như SegWit hay Taproot, sự thay đổi này đòi hỏi thời gian dài thảo luận, thử nghiệm và sự đồng thuận từ cộng đồng. Thành công của BIP 177 phụ thuộc không chỉ vào chất lượng kỹ thuật mà còn vào mức độ sẵn sàng thay đổi của cộng đồng Bitcoin. Sau 16 năm, tại sao vẫn tranh luận về tên đơn vị nhỏ nhất của BTC? Bitcoin, với tư cách là tài sản kỹ thuật số, có thể chia nhỏ thành những đơn vị cực kỳ bé để hỗ trợ nhiều loại hoạt động kinh tế, từ các giao dịch giá trị cao đến các microtransaction. Đơn vị nổi tiếng nhất chính là “satoshi,” đại diện cho 1/100.000.000 của một bitcoin. Thuật ngữ “satoshi” lần đầu tiên được đề xuất trên diễn đàn Bitcointalk.org năm 2010 bởi một người dùng có nickname Ribuck, người cũng gợi ý tên gọi “austrian” để tôn vinh Trường phái Kinh tế Áo. Theo thời gian, cộng đồng đã chọn “satoshi” làm đơn vị nguyên tử của Bitcoin, vừa để vinh danh người sáng lập bí ẩn Satoshi Nakamoto, vừa tạo ra một ngôn ngữ văn hóa ngắn gọn như “stacking sats.” Tuy nhiên, một đơn vị khác – “bit,” tương đương với 100 satoshis hoặc 1/1.000.000 của một bitcoin – cũng từng được đề xuất vì tính trực quan hơn. Một số giọng nói nổi bật như Adam Back đã ủng hộ việc hồi sinh “bits,” lý luận rằng nếu giá Bitcoin đạt mức 1 triệu đô la, thì 1 bit sẽ bằng 1 đô la, giúp việc chuyển đổi dễ dàng hơn. Như vậy, cuộc tranh luận giữa “sats” và “bits” không chỉ là vấn đề kỹ thuật mà còn là câu chuyện giữa truyền thống và thiết kế thân thiện với người dùng. Hiện tại, Bitcoin có nhiều đơn vị khác nhau: BTC, mBTC (millibitcoin), µBTC (microbitcoin hoặc “bits”), và satoshis. Điều này có thể gây nhầm lẫn, đặc biệt với những người không chuyên về công nghệ. Một bitcoin (1 BTC) bằng 1.000 mBTC, 1.000.000 bits, hoặc 100.000.000 satoshis. Sự đa dạng này tạo ra độ phức tạp không cần thiết, đặc biệt khi người dùng phải đối mặt với các con số nhỏ như 0.000043 BTC hoặc 4300 satoshis. Theo BIP 177, một bitcoin đầy đủ – tức 100 triệu satoshis – có thể được gọi là “Mega Bitcoin.” Việc loại bỏ dấu thập phân và chuẩn hóa đơn vị thành “bitcoins” sẽ giúp giảm bớt cảm giác xa lạ và kỹ thuật hóa, mang lại cảm giác gần gũi hơn với người dùng phổ thông. BIP 177 , do CEO Synonym John Carvalho đề xuất, nhằm mục đích thay đổi cách hiểu thông thường về đơn vị Bitcoin bằng cách sử dụng đơn vị nhỏ nhất (đơn vị nguyên tố) làm tiêu chuẩn hiển thị. Thay vì biểu diễn giá trị Bitcoin dưới dạng thập phân (ví dụ: 0.00004321 BTC), BIP 177 khuyến nghị loại bỏ hoàn toàn dấu thập phân và gọi mỗi đơn vị cơ bản là “1 bitcoin.” Với mô hình này, điều từng được gọi là “1 satoshi” (1/100.000.000 BTC) giờ đây sẽ đơn giản là “1 bitcoin.” Các nhà ủng hộ cho rằng hệ thập phân là di sản UI lỗi thời gây nhầm lẫn, đặc biệt với những người mới tham gia. Mặc dù BIP 177 không thay đổi quy tắc đồng thuận hay dữ liệu trên chuỗi, nhưng nó yêu cầu một sự thay đổi đồng bộ trong giao diện ví và sàn giao dịch, đồng thời đối mặt với thách thức văn hóa khi phải thay thế thuật ngữ “sats” đã ăn sâu bén rễ. Bitkit Wallet là ví đầu tiên áp dụng BIP 177 Bitkit Wallet, phát triển bởi Synonym – một công ty “chị em” của Bitfinex – là ví tự quản lý tập trung vào trải nghiệm người dùng thân thiện, giúp mọi người dễ dàng gia nhập hệ sinh thái Bitcoin. Bitkit tích hợp nhiều tính năng tiên tiến như nút Lightning tích hợp sẵn, thanh toán qua định danh phi tập trung (DIDs), và sao lưu mượt mà qua đám mây mã hóa. Điều khiến Bitkit nổi bật là việc áp dụng sớm và nhiệt tình tiêu chuẩn BIP 177. Thay vì sử dụng BTC hoặc các phân số phức tạp như mBTC, ví Bitkit hiển thị giá trị theo “bitcoins,” giúp người dùng dễ hiểu hơn. Ví dụ, thay vì hiển thị “0.000043 BTC,” Bitkit sẽ hiển thị “43 bitcoins.” Điều này biến Bitcoin từ một loại tiền tệ kỹ thuật khó hiểu thành một phương tiện trao đổi quen thuộc, giống như cách chúng ta sử dụng xu hoặc satoshi. Liệu BIP 177 có nhận được sự ủng hộ đủ lớn để tồn tại lâu dài? Hiện chưa rõ BIP 177 có được cộng đồng chấp nhận rộng rãi hay không, dù đã có một số công ty như Square của Jack Dorsey bắt đầu áp dụng. Các ví và sàn lớn vẫn ưu tiên BTC hay satoshi, cho thấy xu hướng bảo thủ trong cộng đồng Bitcoin. Nhìn lại lịch sử, những thay đổi dù có lợi rõ ràng về mặt kỹ thuật như SegWit ( BIP 141 ) hay Taproot ( BIP 341 ) cũng phải mất vài năm mới được chấp nhận. SegWit chẳng hạn, được đề xuất từ 2015 nhưng đến tận 2017 mới được kích hoạt, sau hàng loạt tranh luận và một cuộc nội chiến trong cộng đồng, gồm cả UASF và các cuộc chạy đua giữa thợ đào. Quá trình thay đổi tiêu chuẩn đã định hình luôn khó khăn, đặc biệt khi liên quan đến giao diện người dùng. Nhiều người dùng và lập trình viên không muốn thay đổi thói quen, dù đề xuất có lợi về mặt trải nghiệm. Thiếu sự phối hợp từ các bên lớn như ví, nền tảng thanh toán, giáo dục – BIP 177 có nguy cơ chỉ dừng lại ở ý tưởng tốt nhưng không được triển khai. Trong hệ sinh thái Bitcoin, BIP là những đề xuất cải tiến – từ giao thức đến giao diện. Một số BIP cần đồng thuận toàn mạng (ví dụ SegWit hay Taproot), còn BIP 177 thuộc dạng tự nguyện áp dụng. Nhưng kể cả vậy, mọi thay đổi có ý nghĩa đều phải vượt qua cộng đồng phân mảnh, thận trọng và hoài nghi. Vấn đề nằm ở cách vận hành của cộng đồng Bitcoin: phi tập trung, cẩn trọng và không ai có quyền ra lệnh thay đổi. BIP 177 là thay đổi không cần đồng thuận toàn mạng, nhưng vẫn phải dựa vào sự tự nguyện của các nhà phát triển và dịch vụ. Khi 1 satoshi dần tiệm cận giá trị 1 đô, cách hiển thị trực quan hơn như BIP 177 (dùng “bit”) có thể giúp giao dịch hàng ngày dễ hiểu hơn. Hiện tại, một số dự án như Spiral , Square , Workit và Cashu đang trong quá trình triển khai BIP 177 ở các mức độ khác nhau. Trong một hệ thống mà mặc định là “không thay đổi”, ngay cả một cải tiến nhỏ như BIP 177 cũng phải đối mặt với rào cản cao để được công nhận chính thức. Tóm Lại Là: Cuộc tranh luận về tên gọi đơn vị Bitcoin phản ánh sự cân bằng giữa truyền thống và tính tiện dụng. Dù “satoshi” đã trở thành biểu tượng văn hóa, “bit” hay “bitcoins” có thể mở ra cánh cửa cho việc áp dụng rộng rãi hơn. Với sự dẫn đầu của các dự án như Bitkit Wallet và tiềm năng từ các công ty lớn như Square, BIP 177 có cơ hội tạo ra một bước ngoặt trong cách chúng ta nhìn nhận và sử dụng Bitcoin. Trong thế giới Bitcoin, mọi thay đổi dù nhỏ cũng cần thời gian, kiểm chứng và sự đồng thuận rộng rãi. Liệu BIP 177 có trở thành chuẩn mực hay chỉ là một ý tưởng thú vị? Hãy cùng chờ xem!

2025-06-10T03:45:00,"Ruvi AI (RUVI) Attracts Cardano (ADA) Holders as Industry Experts Forecast Explosive ROI for Early Investors in 2025","The crypto world is buzzing and Ruvi AI (RUVI) is at the center of it all. Cardano (ADA) holders are taking notice and industry experts are predicting explosive returns on investment (ROI) for early backers by 2025. But what’s behind the hype? And how does Ruvi AI differ from Cardano, one of the biggest blockchain platforms in the crypto space? Whether you’re an experienced investor or just looking for new opportunities, this shift from ADA to RUVI is worth understanding. From their tech to growth potential, there’s a lot to unpack. Cardano (ADA): A Blockchain OG Cardano is a well known name in the crypto space and has built a reputation as one of the most reliable and sustainable blockchain platforms. Their Ouroboros proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol made them a green alternative to energy hungry proof-of-work systems like Bitcoin. But no project is immune to market competition. Diversification is always top of mind for forward thinking investors and now Ruvi AI is emerging as a great opportunity for those looking to maximize returns and get in on the next big blockchain wave. Ruvi AI (RUVI): Blockchain + AI Ruvi AI is no ordinary cryptocurrency. It’s a leap forward, blockchain + AI. This decentralized superapp isn’t just for trading or holding, it’s designed to solve real world problems for businesses and individuals. Ruvi AI allows users to create AI driven content in almost any format imaginable, text, audio, video, image creation. This benefits industries like marketing, content production and workflow optimization by providing tools that are efficient, secure and adaptive. At the heart of Ruvi AI’s ecosystem is the $RUVI token which powers the platform and has real utility. It enables seamless transactions, provides token holders with staking rewards and governance rights within the community. Unlike speculative ventures Ruvi AI has real world use cases that make it a future proof project capable of industry disruption. When you combine blockchain’s security with AI’s limitless possibilities you get a technology that’s not only innovative but practical. Ruvi AI’s Presale is a Success The excitement around Ruvi AI is best measured by its presale success. Phase 1 launched at $0.010 and sold out in 2 weeks. Phase 2 increased by 50% to $0.015 and those who joined early got rewarded. Presale has already attracted over 1,400 investors and raised $1.5 million. Ruvi AI is on the move. But that’s not all. Ruvi AI has already listed on an exchange and partnered with a major trading platform to expand its reach. More announcements coming soon. Ruvi AI is building for long term and keeping the momentum going. For those looking for the next big project in the crypto space Ruvi AI is not to be missed. What Do the Numbers Say About RUVI? For investors Ruvi AI’s presale is not just an entry point into a new project, it’s an opportunity for massive capital growth. Here’s a breakdown of the potential returns across 3 investment tiers: VIP 2 Threshold : 50,000 RUVI (Cost = $750 at $0.015/token). Bonus : 40% (20,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 70,000. Potential Returns : At $0.07 Listing Price: $4,900 (553% ROI). At $1 Post-Launch Price: $70,000 (9,233% ROI). VIP 3 Threshold : 100,000 RUVI (Cost = $1,500 at $0.015/token). Bonus : 60% (60,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 160,000. Potential Returns : At $0.07 Listing Price: $11,200 (647% ROI). At $1 Post-Launch Price: $160,000 (10,567% ROI). VIP 5 Threshold : 500,000 RUVI (Cost = $7,500 at $0.015/token). Bonus : 100% (500,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 1,000,000. Potential Returns At $0.07 Listing Price: $7,500 (833% ROI) At $1 Post-Launch Price: $75,000 (13,233% ROI) Why Cardano (ADA) Holders Are Switching to RUVI The migration of Cardano holders to Ruvi AI can be attributed to: Technological Advancement Ruvi AI’s blockchain + AI is a leap forward that Cardano doesn’t offer, so those looking for advanced solutions are switching. Clear Signs of Growth Strong presale, early listings and growing community all point to a well structured and scalable project. Real World Utility Unlike tokens that rely on speculation Ruvi AI solves real world problems with practical applications so investors can bet on it. Massive Upside With analysts predicting explosive ROI and low entry price, early adoption could be huge.

2025-06-10T03:30:51,"On-Chain Data Flashes Bullish: Is Bitcoin Ready for a $110K Comeback?","Bitcoin has resumed its upward trajectory, registering a modest 1.6% gain over the last 24 hours to trade at $107,428. The recovery comes after last week’s dip toward $100,000 levels, which had been triggered by market-wide volatility and profit-taking. While BTC remains approximately 4.2% below its all-time high of $111,000 reached last month, the weekly trend still reflects a 3.3% increase, suggesting buyers are gradually regaining confidence. This market behavior is mirrored in a set of on-chain indicators recently analyzed by CryptoQuant contributor Amr Taha. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Ethereum Defend Key Moving Averages – Bullish Signal Or Temporary Relief? Bitcoin On-Chain Metrics Reflect Accumulation Behavior In Taha’s analysis titled “On-Chain Data Hints at Bitcoin’s Next Leg Higher,” Taha examined several metrics that point to a potential continuation of the rally. These include the Binance Taker Buy/Sell Ratio, UTXO age bands, and the Long-Term Holder (LTH) realized cap. All three suggest that market participants are actively accumulating and that underlying sentiment is shifting toward renewed bullishness. One of the primary indicators Taha focused on is Binance’s Taker Buy/Sell Ratio, which has recently climbed to 1.1. This metric evaluates the volume of aggressive market buys versus market sells on the Binance exchange. A ratio above 1 typically implies that more participants are willing to pay the market price to buy than to sell, indicating stronger buyer conviction. According to Taha, such shifts historically precede continued price increases when supported by volume. Another key metric showing strength is the Buy/Sell Pressure Delta over the last 90 days. This indicator tracks the net difference between buying and selling pressure and is now halfway to its historical peak at 0.02. Taha explains that this suggests a market not yet overheated, with room for further accumulation. Combined with recent breakout behavior above the 1D–1W UTXO band, representing recently transacted coins, this hints that many new holders are currently in profit and choosing to hold rather than sell. LTH Conviction and Stablecoin Inflows Reinforce Bullish Case Taha also noted the Long-Term Holder (LTH) Realized Cap has now surpassed $56 billion, reflecting strong hands holding a larger share of Bitcoin supply. These coins have not moved in over 155 days and are considered to represent investors with higher conviction. The increase in this metric implies that fewer coins are being sold into the market, a signal that many investors are expecting higher valuations in the coming weeks or months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Leveraged Traders Are Back Betting On A Price Decline — What This Means In addition, more than $550 million in stablecoins have reportedly flowed into Binance in recent hours. Historically, such inflows to spot exchanges, as opposed to derivatives platforms, often suggest readiness to deploy capital for direct asset purchases. Notably, all of these indicators can be seen as a leading signal of potential volatility or buying pressure. If this pattern holds, Bitcoin’s short-term price activity may benefit from continued accumulation and institutional positioning.

2025-06-10T03:19:03,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: BTC Holds $109.7K as Bulls Watch $111.8K","Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $109,690, up 3.81% in the last 24 hours, as traders weigh global macro risks and technical momentum. This week’s Bitcoin price prediction leans bullish, following a sharp recovery from the previous week’s dip below $100,400, triggered by the Trump-Musk spat, and a strong bounce fueled by U.S. jobs data and renewed risk appetite. Investors are now watching U.S.–China trade talks in London, a key geopolitical event that may impact risk markets. So far, Bitcoin has remained resilient above $109,000, signaling investor confidence. What’s keeping Bitcoin steady? Apart from macro support, institutional participation is growing fast: Over 80 publicly traded companies (e.g., MicroStrategy, GameStop) now hold BTC The U.S. government owns nearly 200,000 BTC, according to blockchain data Gemini’s IPO filing points to sustained investor interest in crypto firms Together, these factors add legitimacy and long-term demand strength, bolstering bullish Bitcoin price predictions. Bitcoin Faces Key Resistance at $111.8K On the technical side, the Bitcoin price prediction remains bullish as BTC approaches the upper trendline of its ascending channel, testing resistance near $111,848. A breakout here would confirm the bullish continuation setup and target higher resistance levels at $115,103 and $118,358. The daily RSI is holding at 61, signaling positive momentum but leaving room before overbought conditions emerge. Also worth noting: the June 7 bullish engulfing candle, which often marks a return to trend after a retracement. Bitcoin price prediction: short-term trade idea Entry: Confirmed daily close above $111,848 Stop-loss: Below $107,616 Target 1: $115,103 Target 2: $118,358 Watch for: RSI divergence or rejection at $111.8K This bullish setup remains valid as long as BTC stays above the lower channel trendline near $107,000. Crackdowns and M&A Signal Maturing Market Beyond price, structural developments are helping shape Bitcoin’s evolving reputation. In Australia, authorities have just charged four money laundering rings involving $123 million in cryptocurrency, showing that even illicit crypto activity can be traced, which boosts trust in blockchain transparency. $NCPL buys Mixie, a blockchain-native platform building infrastructure and tools for Web3 games, creator media, and decentralized community engagement. pic.twitter.com/gRzkZzSyi2 — Joey Rattlesnake (@tallahassee_m) June 9, 2025 Meanwhile, Netcapital (NCPL) acquired the crypto-native platform Mixie, marking a significant step in crypto mergers and acquisitions (M&A). The fintech firm said the deal enhances its Web3 capabilities, reflecting broader institutional interest. This follows a 2025 trend of consolidation led by players like Coinbase and Ripple. These headlines support the broader Bitcoin price prediction narrative: strong demand, growing corporate adoption, and tightening legal clarity are laying the groundwork for Bitcoin’s next leg up.

Here’s how other major assets like XRP and Bitcoin compare. Dogecoin Beats Several Top Coins In Total Amount Of Holders In a post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has shared how the various top coins in the cryptocurrency sector have compared against each other in terms of the Total Amount of Holders. The Total Amount of Holders here refers to an indicator that measures, as its name suggests, the total number of addresses that are carrying some non-zero balance on a given network. When the value of this metric rises, it can have a number of underlying causes. New investors coming into the network and old ones who had sold earlier returning, both result in an increase for the indicator. Existing users creating fresh wallets to distribute their holdings or for privacy purposes can also naturally contribute to this trend. In general, all of these factors could be assumed to simultaneously be at play whenever the Total Amount of Holders goes up. As such, some net adoption takes place alongside this trend. For any cryptocurrency, adoption is something that tends to be constructive, as a wider user base can provide for a more solid foundation for the asset to grow on in the future. Usually, though, the positive effects of it only end up being visible in the long term. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Total Amount of Holders for eight top digital assets: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), Chainlink (LINK), Tether (USDT), and USD Coin (USDC). As displayed in the above graph, the Total Amount of Holders has steadily been going up for all of these assets recently, which suggests adoption has been occurring across the top coins. One asset, however, stands out for its particularly sharp growth: Dogecoin. From the chart, it’s visible that the memecoin saw the indicator go through a steep climb last month, indicating that users opened up a large amount of DOGE wallets inside a narrow window. That said, while this was a very sharp jump, the indicator has more or less plateaued for the asset since then. The Dogecoin network now has 7.97 million holders. This makes the cryptocurrency the third largest on this list, ahead of USDC’s 7.79 million and XRP’s 6.53 million. The memecoin is still only the “king of the rest,” though, as both Bitcoin and Ethereum are many times larger. ETH, especially, boasts an impressive 148.38 million non-empty addresses, outweighing BTC by a factor of nearly 3.

2025-06-10T02:16:03,"Why is The Crypto Market Going Up Today?","The post Why is The Crypto Market Going Up Today? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market is back in action today, with a sharp rally across major coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. At the time of writing, the total crypto market capitalization has jumped to $3.43 trillion, showing a healthy 4.22% rise in the past 24 hours. Investor sentiment has also turned positive. The Fear & Greed Index now reads 64, firmly in ‘Greed’ territory — a clear sign that traders are feeling confident about the market’s direction. So, what’s fueling this rally? Let’s break it down. Bitcoin Leads the Charge The star of the show is Bitcoin, which finally broke out of a consolidation range it had been stuck in since May 23rd. Currently trading above $109,500, Bitcoin’s breakout is being closely watched by analysts. This move was expected because of a bullish weekly candle formation called a three-inside-up pattern around the $100,000 mark. Historically, this kind of setup often leads to an 8-10% pump within a week or two. If momentum continues, some analysts believe Bitcoin could soon touch $115,000 — or even higher. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Key Takeaway Points from SEC Chair Paul Atkin’s Remarks at the Crypto Task Force Roundtable Today , Global Factors Also at Play Apart from technical signals, positive news on the macro front is also helping the rally. Reports show that trade talks between the United States and China have resumed, easing global market tensions. This, combined with growing institutional interest , has boosted investor confidence. Altcoins Follow Suit Following Bitcoin’s lead, altcoins are also climbing. Ethereum is up over 8% this week, now trading at $2,699, while Solana and Dogecoin have surged 5% and 6.6% respectively. Interestingly, Sui (SUI) and Hyperliquid (HYPE) have posted impressive double-digit gains. The Altcoin Season Index, however, remains at 30 out of 100, meaning that while altcoins are rallying, a full-fledged alt season hasn’t arrived yet. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The move pushed the firm’s average purchase price to $70,086, after buying at levels above $100,000 in recent weeks. Related Reading: Elon Musk ‘Will Do Anything’ To Make XRP King, Tech Mogul Says So far, the Michael Saylor-led company has spent more than $40 billion on Bitcoin and is lining up more financing to keep the buys coming. Weekly Bitcoin Purchases Continue Strategy’s drip-feed gameplan has become routine. The firm bought just under 2,000 BTC over the last two weeks, but split those into smaller chunks. That steady rhythm helps avoid big bumps in the market. It also keeps the firm in the headlines on a weekly basis. Traders watch closely. When the company buys, prices tend to move up. Strategy has acquired 1,045 BTC for ~$110.2 million at ~$105,426 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 17.1% YTD 2025.

The latest filings show $62.7 million in STRK and $43.3 million in STRF went into Bitcoin purchases. No new common shares were registered this round. That keeps Strategy at about 0.02 BTC per MSTR share—10 times more Bitcoin per share than any other name in the sector. Strategy's latest Bitcoin purchase filing with the SEC. Impact On Market Supply Corporate treasuries now hold roughly 3.4 million BTC. That stash includes what miners and governments no longer sell. It leaves less coin on the open market. Over-the-counter desks have seen their inventories drop from 236,000 BTC a month ago to just 123,500 BTC today. Even Coinbase Prime, one of the main outlets for big players, shows only 63,535 BTC available. Corporate Trends And Outlook Strategy’s moves still cast a long shadow. Only 26 other public companies have more than 1,000 BTC, and just seven hold over 10,000 BTC. On-chain data points to nearly 2,000 whale wallets that top those numbers. In the past week alone, five additional firms bought BTC, using their purchases to grab attention on social media. In all, 124 public companies have now listed Bitcoin on their balance sheets or signaled plans to buy.

2025-06-10T01:32:44,"Asia Morning Briefing: BTC Slips Below $110K as 'Signs of Fatigue' Emerging","Good Morning, Asia. Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Bitcoin is trading below $110,000, changing hands at $109.7K , as Asia continues its trading week. The move challenges a prevailing market narrative of summer stagnation, coming on the heels of a note from QCP Capital that emphasized suppressed volatility and a lack of immediate catalysts. A recent Telegram note from QCP pointed to one-year lows in implied volatility and a pattern of subdued price action, noting that BTC had been “stuck in a tight range” as summer approaches. A clean break below $100K or above $110K, they wrote, would be needed to “reawaken broader market interest.” Even so, QCP warned that recent macro developments had failed to spark directional conviction. “Even as US equities rallied and gold sold off in the wake of Friday’s stronger-than-expected jobs report, BTC remained conspicuously unmoved, caught in the cross-currents without a clear macro anchor,” the note said. “Without a compelling narrative to spark the next leg higher, signs of fatigue are emerging. Perpetual open interest is softening, and spot BTC ETF inflows have started to taper.” That context makes the current move all the more surprising. Over the weekend, Bitcoin surged 3.26% from $105,393 to $108,801, with hourly volume spiking to 2.5x the 24-hour average, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. BTC broke decisively above $106,500, establishing new support at $107,600, and continued upward into Monday’s session, reaching $110,169. The breakout coincides with a tense macro backdrop: US-China trade talks in London and a $22 billion U.S. Treasury bond auction later this week have injected uncertainty into global markets. While these events could drive fresh volatility, QCP cautioned that recent headlines have mostly led to “knee-jerk reactions” that quickly fade. The question now is whether BTC’s move above $110K has true staying power, or whether the rally is running ahead of the fundamentals. A 'Massive Shift' in Institutional Staking May Drive ETH's Next Rally Ethereum’s critics have long highlighted centralization risks, but that narrative is fading as institutional adoption accelerates, infrastructure matures, and recent protocol upgrades directly address past limitations. “Market participants will pay for decentralization because it's in their economic interest from a security and principal protection standpoint,” Mara Schmiedt, CEO of institutional Ethereum staking platform Alluvial, told CoinDesk. “If you look at [decentralization metrics] all of these things have massively improved over the last couple of years."" There's currently $492 million worth of ETH staked by Liquid Collective – a protocol co-founded by Alluvial to facilitate institutional staking While this figure may appear modest compared to Ethereum’s total staked volume of around $93 billion, what's interesting is that it originates predominantly from institutional investors. ""We’re really on the cusp of a truly massive shift for Ethereum, driven by regulatory momentum and the ability to unlock the advantages of secure staking,"" she noted. Central to Ethereum’s institutional readiness is the recent Pectra upgrade, a significant development Schmiedt describes as both ""massive"" and ""underappreciated."" ""I think Pectra has been a massive upgrade. I actually think it’s been underappreciated, just in terms of the tremendous amount of change it introduces into the staking mechanics,"" Schmiedt said. Additionally, Execution Layer triggerable withdrawals—a key component of Pectra—provide institutional participants, including ETF issuers, a crucial compatibility upgrade. This feature enables partial validator exits directly from Ethereum’s execution layer, aligning with institutional operational requirements such as T+1 redemption timelines. ""EL triggerable withdrawals create a much more effective path to exit for large-scale market participants,"" Schmiedt added. Ultimately, Schmiedt said, ""I think we'll see that a lot more [ETH] in institutional portfolios going forward.” News Roundup Trump Media May Be the Cheapest Bitcoin Play Among Public Stocks, NYDIG Says Trump Media (DJT) may be one of the cheapest ways to get bitcoin exposure in public markets, according to a new report from NYDIG, CoinDesk recently reported. As a growing number of companies adopt MicroStrategy’s strategy of stacking BTC on their balance sheets, analysts are rethinking how to value these so-called bitcoin treasury firms. While the commonly used modified net asset value (mNAV) metric suggests that investors are paying a premium for BTC exposure, NYDIG’s Greg Cipolaro argues mNAV alone is “woefully deficient.” Instead, he points to the equity premium to NAV, which factors in debt, cash, and enterprise value, as a more accurate gauge. By that measure, Trump Media and Semler Scientific (SMLR) rank as the most undervalued of eight companies analyzed, trading at equity premiums of -16% and -10% respectively, despite both showing mNAVs above 1.1. In other words, their shares are worth less than the value of the bitcoin they hold. That’s in stark contrast to MicroStrategy (MSTR), which rose nearly 5% Monday as bitcoin crossed $110,000, while DJT and SMLR remained mostly flat—making them potentially overlooked vehicles for BTC exposure. Circle Stock Nearly Quadruples Post-IPO as Bitwise and ProShares File Competing ETFs Two major ETF issuers, Bitwise and ProShares, filed proposals on June 6 to launch exchange-traded funds tied to Circle (CRCL), whose stock has nearly quadrupled since its IPO late last week, CoinDesk previously reported. ProShares is aiming for a leveraged product that delivers 2x the daily performance of CRCL. At the same time, Bitwise plans a covered call fund that generates income by selling options against held shares, two very different ways to capitalize on the stock’s explosive rise. CRCL surged another 9% Monday in volatile trading, continuing to draw interest from both traditional finance and crypto investors. The proposed ETFs have an effective date of August 20, pending SEC approval. If approved, they would further blur the lines between crypto and conventional finance, giving investors new tools to play one of the hottest post-IPO names of the year. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin is trading at $109,795 after a 3.26% breakout fueled by institutional buying, elevated volume, and macro uncertainty from US-China trade talks and an upcoming $22B Treasury auction. ETH: Ethereum rebounded 4.46% from a low of $2,480 to close at $2,581, with strong buying volume confirming support at $2,580 and setting up a potential breakout above $2,590. Gold: Gold is trading at $3,314.45, edging up 0.08% as investors watch US-China trade talks in London and a subdued dollar keeps prices attractive.

2025-06-10T01:00:35,"Bitcoin & Ethereum Diverge—ETF Flows Just Flipped The Narrative","Data shows the demand for spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has cooled off for Bitcoin, while Ethereum has continued to attract inflows. Bitcoin Has Ended A Streak Of Positive ETF Flows In a new thread on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the total balance of the US spot ETFs has changed for Bitcoin and Ethereum recently. The spot ETFs refer to investment vehicles that provide an alternate means of gaining exposure to a cryptocurrency’s price movements in a manner that’s familiar to traditional investors. Related Reading: Crypto Suffers $1 Billion Flush As Musk-Trump Feud Shakes Bitcoin These ETFs are a relatively new presence in the sector, but they have gained sufficient popularity to become a key part of the market. Investors who previously avoided digital assets due to the perceived complexity of wallets and exchanges can now invest through ETFs, which trade on traditional exchanges. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the spot ETFs for Bitcoin back in January 2024. They got approval for Ethereum half a year later, in July 2024. First, here is how the balance held by the spot ETFs has changed for Ethereum since their inauguration: As displayed in the above graph, the total balance of the Ethereum spot ETFs has been on the rise recently. In fact, the cryptocurrency has now seen four straight weeks of net inflows. In all, 97,800 ETH have entered into the wallets associated with these ETFs during this green netflow streak. Though despite the continuous inflows, their total holdings are yet to hit the 3.81 million ETH peak from February, as they currently sit at 3.77 million ETH, about 41,000 tokens lower. “Accumulation is steady, but room remains for further upside,” notes Glassnode. Bitcoin has also seen growth in its spot ETF holdings recently, but unlike Ethereum, the number one digital asset saw the metric surpass its high from February last month. That said, while the Bitcoin spot ETFs were enjoying inflows until very recently, the trend has changed during the past week as net outflows have occurred instead. This has been the first negative week in eight for the BTC ETFs. “Total holdings are now 1.20M BTC, down ~11.5K BTC from the late-May peak,” explains the analytics firm. “A pause in demand after a strong run-up – watch for signs of re-acceleration.” Related Reading: Bitcoin RSI Dips Below 30—Is A New All-Time High Next?

2025-06-10T00:28:46,"Top Reasons Why Ethereum (ETH) Price Will Reach $2,800 This Week","The post Top Reasons Why Ethereum (ETH) Price Will Reach $2,800 This Week appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As Bitcoin (BTC) price rallied above $110k on Monday, June 9, Ethereum (ETH) price jumped over 7 percent in the last 24 hours to trade about $2,686 during the late North American trading session. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $323 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of around $19 billion, rebounded from the lower border of a consolidation level of around $2,480. As a result, the ETH price has been retesting a crucial local resistance level around $2,681, whereby the Ether price was rejected four times in the past four weeks. Major Reasons Ethereum Price Will Rally Higher This Week Strong Institutional Adoption and ETF Flows According to market data analysis from CoinShares, Ethereum’s investment product dominated last week’s cash inflow with about $296 million. Notably, Ether’s investment product outpaced Bitcoin’s, which recorded a net cash outflow of about $56.5 million last week. As Coinpedia had reported , BlackRock’s ETHA has recorded significant cash inflows in the past two weeks, suggesting a strong demand from institutional clients. Altseason Sentiment Ethereum price is well positioned to rally towards a new local high this week fueled by the rising narrative of altseason 2025. With Bitcoin dominance signaling an imminent market reversal, more crypto investors are betting on a major altcoin rally in the near future. Furthermore, the ETH/BTC pair is heavily oversold in the weekly timeframe, amid the recent market reversal. Regulatory Clarity Earlier on Monday, the U.S. Chair Paul Atkins highlighted that American crypto investors have the right to self-custody of crypto assets. Additionally, Chair Atkins highlighted that a new and clear set of DeFi regulations are needed to foster the development of the nascent blockchain technology. With Ethereum harboring the largest DeFi space, with a total value locked (TVL) of about $63 billion and a stablecoins market cap of around $124 billion, the altcoin is well positioned to rally further in the near future.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/top-reasons-why-ethereum-eth-price-will-reach-2800-this-week/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Ethereum",cryptocompare

2025-06-10T00:20:08,"Crypto IPO boom and trade talks fuel Bitcoin’s climb","Bitcoin soared above the $110,000 mark late Monday for the first time in nearly two weeks, buoyed by optimism surrounding renewed trade discussions between the United States and China. The price jump also triggered a wave of short liquidations as the rally gained momentum. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization recently traded at around $110,286 , marking a 3.6% gain over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin is now up nearly 5% over the last seven days, rebounding from a dip below $101,000 on June 5—a pullback that capped a broader decline dating back to late May. With BTC now nearing its all-time high of $111,814 set in May, market watchers are taking note. “Bitcoin breaking above $110,000 for the first time in two weeks signals renewed bullish momentum after a period of consolidation,” said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto investment firm BitBull Capital. “If BTC can hold this level, it may set the stage for a fresh push toward the $120,000 range.” Other major altcoins also rose. Ethereum (ETH), the second cryptocurrency by market cap, gained 4.5% to more than $2,679, and Solana (SOL) added more than 3% to hover close to $160. Even meme coins, which have struggled in recent weeks, showed signs of recovery. Dogecoin jumped 4.5%, and Shiba Inu added 2.5%. Crypto IPO boom and trade talks fuel Bitcoin’s climb The market’s uplift coincides with renewed talks between Washington and Beijing over longstanding trade tariffs—discussions that have soothed broader investor nerves. Investors seem optimistic about the potential for resolving trade disputes between the US and one of its largest trading partners. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and China’s vice premier for economic policy, He Lifeng, will lead their respective delegations in negotiations expected to continue on Tuesday. Equities responded modestly, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 edging slightly on the day. Another factor contributing to Bitcoin’s price surge is increased crypto-related IPOs . Last week, stablecoin giant Circle went public on the New York Stock Exchange and saw its shares pop over 168%, jumping from $31 to $69 within the first day of trading. Gemini, a crypto exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins, also filed for an IPO According to David Siemer, CEO of crypto asset management company Wave Digital Assets, while the IPO bump is likely short-term excitement, the long-term institutional positioning leads us to be bullish about Bitcoin’s continued performance in 2025. Bitcoin shorts crushed as $323M liquidated in a day In the past 24 hours, close to $323 million of crypto short positions have been liquidated, CoinGlass data shows. Most of the damage was in Bitcoin, which saw around $196 million worth of liquidations. The liquidations come amid mounting macroeconomic pressures and renewed trade tensions, which have rattled investor confidence. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen outflows in five of the last seven trading sessions, reflecting the cautious sentiment. In contrast, Ethereum ETFs have enjoyed a streak of positive momentum, notching 15 consecutive days of inflows. 10X Research wrote in a report released Monday morning that Bitcoin is testing a breakout level, and the market setup appears significantly different from what most investors anticipated just weeks ago. According to the report, negative funding rates, a pattern of market bottoms, and a surprising surge in spot demand combine to create a high-conviction signal.

The pseudonymous analyst tells his 548,000 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin is attempting to move into a “price discovery uptrend.” Price discovery often refers to a process when the price of an asset moves to uncharted territory, forcing buyers and sellers to seek agreement on value. Says Rekt Capital, “Bitcoin Price Discovery Roadmap: Bitcoin is currently in a transitional phase. Price is trying to successfully post-breakout retest its ReAccumulation Range to transition into Price Discovery Uptrend 2. A volatile retest/deviation here could occur.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Rekt Capital says that BTC closing above $104,400 on the week could be the key signal that it has successfully retested the demand zone and is gearing up for higher prices. “The retest continues to be successful. Can Bitcoin successfully confirm this retest with a Weekly Close above $104400 for what would be a 4th week in a row?” Zooming in on the daily chart, the trader says that BTC needs to close above its immediate resistance and flip it into support to fully confirm a bullish continuation of the trend. “On the Daily timeframe, Bitcoin is showcasing signs of breaking its two-week Downtrend (light blue) while also turning it into support… Daily Closing & retesting ~$106,600 (black) would be even better to enable trend continuation.” Source: Rekt Capital/X At time of writing, BTC is trading at $105,528.
