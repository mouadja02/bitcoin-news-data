2025-06-10T11:45:21,"Brian Armstrong Calls Account Freezing a ‘Major Issue’ for Coinbase, Says Problem Reduced by 82% With More Improvements Coming","Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong says that the top US-based crypto exchange has dramatically reduced the instances of account freezes. In a new post on the social media platform X, Armstrong says Coinbase has made fixing unwarranted account freezes a top priority, while acknowledging the issue has lasted longer than it should have. “Account freezing has been a major issue at Coinbase for longer than is acceptable. I could list a bunch of the underlying reasons why it got so bad in the first place, but what’s more important is that we’ve made it a priority to fix, and we have been making good progress… The issue has been reduced by 82% so far, with more improvements coming. We’ll keep you updated as further improvements roll out.” Armstrong also promises a more timely response to customers whose accounts are frozen. “If your account is still restricted (not for sanctioned or illegal activity) please direct message @coinbasesupport and we’ll prioritize getting it looked at ASAP.” Armstrong gives credit to Coinbase’s product team member Dor Levi, who was hired in April, for achieving the fix. Says Levi, “If you’re on CT (crypto Twitter), you know how significant this issue has been for users. I myself am a Coinbase user, and our restriction experience is not meeting my own bar. The goal is clear: account freezes should be rare, limited to situations that warrant them, primarily when we’re legally obligated (e.g. sanctions or court orders) or protecting users (e.g. from scams or account compromises). We’re committed to getting this right. Recent releases have enabled us to make huge improvements without sacrificing our legal and regulatory obligations or our commitment to safety. In short: We’ve reduced the frequency of account locks by ~82% so far, and new changes are currently rolling out that will bring further reductions. We’ve made significant investments in our ML (machine learning) models, infrastructure, modeling, and teams. So far, we’ve improved the precision and recall of all our models, and are seeing fewer restrictions/freezes as a result. We’ve established guardrails and checks/balances to ensure we maintain focus on this and won’t stop iterating. We’re also tackling this problem from the other end by moving processes like source-of-funds verification and enhanced KYC (Know Your Customer) into the app. This means most restriction types will have self-service flows to remove restrictions, which is much more efficient than previous options.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-10T11:45:09,"Bitcoin News Today: On‑Chain Metrics Signal Bullish Breakout Ahead","The post Bitcoin News Today: On‑Chain Metrics Signal Bullish Breakout Ahead appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin’s latest on-chain signals suggest a bullish shift is building strength. According to CryptoQuant, the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio recently hit 1.1, marking a rise in aggressive buying behavior, while short-term holders are locking in profits instead of exiting early. This, paired with BTC’s 1.84% daily price gain to $107,642, highlights growing confidence in a potential price breakout. Buyers Dominate Again – What Does It Mean for Bitcoin? “After 4 months of red, green CVD bars are back, signaling renewed buy pressure… Historically, green phases often precede strong uptrends.” – By @IT_Tech_PL Read more https://t.co/fG1RCWCM4d pic.twitter.com/IrSkRMkcp5 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 10, 2025 Long-Term Holders Build the Base CryptoQuant data shows Bitcoin’s Realized Cap for long-term holders has now exceeded $56 billion, a level that reflects increasing conviction. Coins older than 155 days are moving into inactive wallets, suggesting holders aren’t looking to sell into the recent rally. Historically, this type of accumulation signals early stages of long-term bull trends, forming a strong foundation beneath BTC’s price. Moreover, Bitcoin’s 30-day volatility dropped to 21.68%, the lowest in weeks. While low volatility may seem dull, such periods often precede explosive price moves. Combined with strong LTH buying and bullish short-term signals, it may set the stage for an upward breakout. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Arthur Hayes Predicts Bitcoin Surge If Bank of Japan Eases Policy , Coin Days Destroyed: A Minor Blip? While Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) rose slightly, up 3.83% to 291.4k, indicating some older coins moved to exchanges, analysts say the shift is minor. Rather than a sell-off, this could reflect normal rebalancing. Overall, bullish metrics continue to outweigh bearish signals. Short Squeeze Possible? CoinGlass data reveals that over 60% of Binance traders are shorting BTC. With such a crowded short trade, a price move higher could trigger a short squeeze, adding fuel to BTC’s rally. Altogether, strong buyer activity, long-term holder confidence, and low volatility suggest Bitcoin may be primed for its next big move upward. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-10T11:30:49,"BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Becomes Fastest Ever To Reach $70 Billion AUM","BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has made headlines by amassing a staggering $70 billion in total assets, achieving this milestone faster than any other exchange-traded fund (ETF) in history. This remarkable feat occurred just 341 days after its launch, according to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, who noted that IBIT reached this figure five times quicker than the previous record holder, State Street’s GLD gold ETF, which took nearly 1,700 days. BlackRock’s IBIT Outshines Competitors As the most popular of the twelve Bitcoin ETFs currently available, IBIT stands out significantly in the market. Following closely behind are Fidelity’s FBTC and Grayscale’s GBTC, both of which have around $20 billion in assets. Related Reading: Dogecoin Is Going To $1 With The ‘Next Impulse’, Analyst Predicts The launch of IBIT and ten other Bitcoin ETFs at the start of last year by the world’s largest asset managers marked a significant shift in the investment landscape, fueled by long-awaited regulatory approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The debut of these funds highlighted a robust demand from investors eager to capitalize on Bitcoin’s price fluctuations. IBIT alone accumulated over $1 billion in assets within just four days of its market introduction. By November, IBIT had surpassed the total assets of BlackRock’s gold fund, solidifying its position as the largest among the 1,400 funds managed by the asset manager worldwide. Bitcoin ETF Market Thrives The momentum didn’t stop there; in December, IBIT became the fastest exchange-traded fund to hit $50 billion in assets, achieving this milestone five times quicker than BlackRock’s iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF, which took nearly four years to reach the same level. “IBIT’s growth is unprecedented,” remarked Bloomberg ETF expert James Seyffart in an interview with Fortune Magazine on Monday. “It’s the fastest ETF to reach most milestones, outpacing any other ETF across all asset classes.” Related Reading: Pundit Says Do Not Ignore Ethereum Amid New All-Time Highs In Major Metric The surge in Bitcoin ETFs has coincided with significant increases in the cryptocurrency’s price. For instance, as Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $111,900 in late May, the cumulative net assets across all twelve Bitcoin ETFs surpassed $134 billion, reflecting the growing interest and investment in this digital asset class. Since reaching its record high, the market’s leading cryptocurrency has retraced, with the most important support line at $100,000 being tested on June 5. Nevertheless, Bitcoin has once again regained its bullish momentum, jumping past the $108,400 mark on Monday. With gains of 2% and 4% on the 24-hour and weekly time frames, respectively, the price of BTC is now only 2.7% below the record price level. This puts the cryptocurrency on the verge of a new price discovery phase after the normal pullback seen last week.

2025-06-10T11:30:10,"Parataxis Holdings Eyes Public Market via SPAC Merger with SilverBox Corp IV","Parataxis Holdings, a digital asset investment platform specializing in Bitcoin, is preparing to go public through a merger with the $200 million special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), SilverBox Corp IV. The two firms entered into a non-binding letter of intent on Monday, signaling the beginning of a potential deal that could bring Parataxis’ institutional-grade crypto strategies to the public market. SilverBox Corp IV, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “SBXD,” is affiliated with SilverBox Capital LLC — a firm established in 2020 to back alternative investments and sponsor SPACs. Parataxis, on the other hand, operates as an affiliate of Parataxis Capital Management, a digital asset firm founded in 2019 with a strong focus on institutional Bitcoin strategies. Parataxis Tapping Institutional Demand for Bitcoin Exposure If the merger proceeds, the combined entity would become a publicly traded platform targeting institutional investors who seek exposure to Bitcoin and other digital assets. According to the announcement, Parataxis aims to offer proprietary strategies for clients who view Bitcoin as a treasury and strategic asset — a trend that has gained traction among corporations and large funds in recent years. “This transaction offers a chance to bring a unique and highly scalable digital asset management platform to the public markets,” said Joe Reece, co-managing partner at SilverBox Capital. He added that the firm sees potential in underserved markets, with South Korea named as an initial area of focus due to rising demand for digital assets. Although the agreement is currently non-binding and no definitive deal has been finalized, it signals increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin-focused investments . Clear Street, a cloud-native platform specializing in multi-asset clearing and portfolio management, is acting as the lead financial advisor for the transaction. SPAC Momentum Picks Up in Crypto Sector SilverBox Corp IV completed its $200 million IPO in August 2024, but its stock had seen only modest gains until news of the merger surfaced. The share price has increased notably in recent days, reflecting growing investor interest in SPACs with crypto exposure. This move follows the successful Nasdaq debut of ProCap Acquisition Corp, a fintech-focused SPAC launched by crypto investor Anthony Pompliano. ProCap’s shares hit an all-time high of $11.35 on June 9, gaining 5.5% since its May 20 launch.

2025-06-10T11:29:33,"XRP and Visa Crypto Debit Card On Coinbase","A recent slide from a Visa presentation highlights new details about how XRP may be positioned within Visa’s broader payment strategy. The document connects XRP to the company’s real-world infrastructure in a way that goes beyond speculation, showing the digital asset as part of a usable payments ecosystem that could be entering live deployment phases. Crypto researcher SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) shared an image of a highlighted section from Visa’s documentation showing that users can now spend XRP directly through debit cards issued by Coinbase, directly linking XRP with Visa’s global strategy. Coinbase Enables Direct Crypto Spending Visa has granted principal membership to Coinbase. This allows the exchange to issue debit cards that let users spend their own Bitcoin, Ether, and XRP “anywhere Visa is accepted.” This removes the need for a third-party issuer and streamlines the ability to use crypto assets directly at point-of-sale, integrating them into the world’s most widely used payments network. Visa Crypto Debit Card XRP https://t.co/3FnbKXo9tn pic.twitter.com/1WhxjecYEM — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 9, 2025 People have speculated that Ripple has been quietly working with Visa for years, and this integration marks more than just a technical advancement. It reflects a shift in how XRP may be used in real-world commerce. By enabling XRP as a spendable currency via debit card infrastructure, Visa could significantly contribute to the asset’s transactional utility. The highlighted text in Visa’s documentation emphasizes that users will be able to “spend their own bitcoin, ether, and XRP,” confirming XRP’s inclusion in Visa’s live product offerings and adding another avenue for increased adoption and utility . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s Network and Visa’s Strategic Position The renewed discussion is closely tied to a 2025 product vision diagram that SMQKE previously shared . It illustrates Ripple’s cross-network payment ecosystem, featuring major names like PayPal, ACH, and Alipay. Visa is shown as directly linked to Ripple and XRP through Ripple’s Liquidity Service. The visual positions Visa within a broader network where XRP could function as a bridge asset for payments across multiple systems. Visa’s “Network of Networks” This integration aligns with broader moves by Visa to build what it calls a “Network of Networks,” consolidating multiple payment systems under a unified interface. SMQKE recently shared information on Visa’s proposed system, highlighting Ripple’s involvement with Earthport , which Visa acquired in 2019, and suggesting that XRP-based liquidity services could play a practical role in this model. Coinbase, now equipped to issue cards directly, is a known partner in crypto adoption efforts. If XRP is among assets supported by default on Coinbase’s Visa card, it gains a natural on-ramp to everyday spending. This is an area many digital assets have yet to penetrate effectively.

2025-06-10T11:26:59,"Bitcoin Millionaire Statistics: 233% Bitcoin Solaris Launch Returns Could Create New Wave of Crypto Rich","The post Bitcoin Millionaire Statistics: 233% Bitcoin Solaris Launch Returns Could Create New Wave of Crypto Rich appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In the early days of Bitcoin, thousands of regular investors turned modest stakes into millionaire portfolios almost by accident. A mere $1,000 in BTC back in 2010 could have exploded into tens of millions. Fast forward to 2025, and while Bitcoin has matured into a $100K juggernaut, many believe the next generational wealth play isn’t BTC itself, but what comes next. Enter: Bitcoin Solaris. From BTC Legends to BTC-S Hopefuls With Bitcoin’s massive rally drawing in institutional attention and consolidating around $100,000, retail investors are increasingly priced out. The hope of a 10X or 100X return feels like a distant dream. That’s why early Bitcoin adopters—and a fresh wave of crypto newcomers—are now turning to Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S), a new blockchain project engineered to mimic Bitcoin’s scarcity but outpace it in speed, flexibility, and earning potential. Why Bitcoin Solaris Is Generating Buzz Bitcoin Solaris is built with a 21 million max supply—the same hard cap that drove Bitcoin’s legendary scarcity. But it doesn’t stop there. It combines cutting-edge technical performance with mobile-first mining and utility-driven DeFi, making it one of the most practical and lucrative new tokens on the market. Unlike most presale tokens that are purely speculative, BTC-S is already backed by serious tech and infrastructure. Let’s break down what makes it a game-changer: Dual-consensus design with Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) Up to 100,000 transactions per second via the Solaris Layer Smart contracts written in Rust, with real-world DeFi, gaming, enterprise, and social use cases Secure, energy-efficient, and audited by both Cyberscope and Freshcoins A Real Path to Wealth—Backed by Performance The promise of 233% gains at launch has fueled investor excitement, but it’s the ecosystem that’s turning attention into conviction. With over 11,000 unique users already onboarded and more than $4.1 million raised, the momentum behind BTC-S is undeniable. Presale Phase 7 is currently underway with the token priced at $7, set to jump to $8 soon. The final launch price? A massive $20—a built-in return of 233%, even before broader market demand comes into play. With less than 8 weeks left, this could be the final window before prices move sharply higher in one of the shortest presales in crypto history. Why Work for Money When BTC-S Can Work for You? Bitcoin Solaris vs Bitcoin – A Mining Evolution Feature Bitcoin Bitcoin Solaris Mining Equipment High-end ASICs required Mobile devices via upcoming app Accessibility Limited to those with capital Open to anyone with a smartphone Energy Usage Extremely high (1,000+ kWh) 99.95% more efficient Mining Speed ~10-minute block time ~2-second finality Network Throughput ~7 TPS Over 10,000 TPS Scalability Minimal Dynamic with dual-layer design Consensus Proof-of-Work (PoW) only Hybrid PoW + DPoS The upcoming Solaris Nova App will allow anyone with a smartphone to mine BTC-S—an evolution that unlocks mass adoption in a way Bitcoin never could. It’s mobile-native, easy to access, and integrated with staking and DeFi utility without relying on expensive ASIC hardware. Influencers Are Paying Attention Crypto influencers are also taking notice. A detailed breakdown by Ben Crypto highlights the unique strengths of Bitcoin Solaris, from its audited smart contracts to its scalable architecture. As more content creators and thought leaders amplify the project, new investor interest continues to surge. The Power of Community and Referrals Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just riding on technical merit—it’s growing through community energy. A dynamic referral program is helping the project spread organically across Telegram, Discord, and Twitter. Early backers are rewarded not just financially, but with real influence in shaping the network’s future. Combined with its open governance structure and fast validator rotation, BTC-S is built to remain community-owned and community-led, just like the early days of Bitcoin. How Bitcoin Solaris Can Create the Next Millionaire Wave Everything about BTC-S is engineered for scalable, long-term value. Its hybrid consensus ensures security and speed, its capped supply preserves scarcity, and its mobile-first approach democratizes access to wealth generation. In a time when Bitcoin itself feels like an elite investment, Bitcoin Solaris opens the door for everyday investors to get in early, before the institutions arrive. If BTC created millionaires by luck, BTC-S may do it by design.

2025-06-10T11:22:23,"Hoskinson Just Confirmed: XRP Is Coming to Cardano (ADA) Lace Wallet","In a development that could reshape the future of decentralized finance, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has officially confirmed that XRP support is being integrated into Cardano’s native Lace Wallet. The announcement, shared by user Xaif on X, took center stage in Hoskinson’s recent “Surprise AMA” YouTube session, marking a significant stride in the evolving relationship between Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP). A New Chapter in Interoperability Initially launched in April 2023 as a dedicated wallet for ADA and Cardano-native tokens, Lace has evolved into a multi-chain powerhouse. It added Bitcoin functionality earlier this year, and now, hosting XRP extends its reach even further. MASSIVE Charles Hoskinson just CONFIRMED it $XRP is coming to Cardano’s Lace Wallet! Cardano x XRP = Future of DeFi pic.twitter.com/6n7dmSGPPc — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) June 10, 2025 During the AMA, when pressed about ongoing talks with Ripple, Hoskinson responded, “Things are moving well,” confirming that Input Output Global (IOG) and Ripple teams have transitioned from competition to collaboration. This integration will enable Lace users not only to hold XRP but also to send and receive it seamlessly, positioning the wallet as a truly unified multi-chain gateway. Ripple-Cardano Relations Deepen Hoskinson’s remarks in the AMA reflected a warm, newfound rapport between the Cardano and Ripple teams . Prior tensions appear to have subsided, replaced by camaraderie and cooperation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Implications for DeFi’s Future From a broader perspective, integrating XRP into Lace demonstrates Cardano’s commitment to positioning itself as a central hub in the Web3 and DeFi ecosystems. By embracing interoperability, both Cardano and Ripple stand to benefit—users gain frictionless access to assets across chains, and developers can more easily build cross-platform applications. For XRP, gaining native support within Lace opens the door to new audiences and wallets, enhancing user convenience. For ADA and the Cardano ecosystem, it marks a strategic leap toward inclusion and technological synergy. What Lies Ahead While no specific launch date has been set, developers at IOG are actively working on integrating XRP support. Lace’s roadmap—first ADA assets, then BTC , now XRP—signals a deliberate, phased expansion toward becoming a true multi-chain wallet. XRP’s arrival on Cardano’s Lace Wallet is no longer speculative. It heralds a new era of collaboration between Cardano and Ripple, rooted in interoperability and mutual growth. As we await the technical rollout, crypto communities can anticipate more integrated DeFi experiences, deeper cross-blockchain cooperation, and innovation fostering a truly interconnected ecosystem.

2025-06-10T11:17:20,"Why Bitcoin’s next stop is $150,000, according to expert","After Bitcoin ( BTC ) surged past the $110,000 mark in the last 24 hours, a trading expert is suggesting the next potential target could be $150,000 if technical indicators continue to align. In this case, prominent online crypto analyst TradingShot observed that Bitcoin’s current rally has invalidated several short-term bearish patterns, confirmed key support levels, and broken through a critical resistance zone. This positions BTC for a potential 101% rally. In a June 10 post on TradingView, the analyst noted that Bitcoin recently rebounded at the lower high trendline of a three-year ascending channel. This historically significant formation has often preceded explosive upward moves. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView This bounce came at a crucial moment, aligning with the 50-week moving average (MA) and effectively dismissing a looming head and shoulders pattern. With that bearish setup out of the picture, momentum appears to have shifted back in favor of the bulls. TradingShot emphasized that this price structure has now appeared thrice in Bitcoin’s ongoing ‘channel up’ formation. Each instance triggered at least a 101% gain. Notably, two of those rallies started from a similar lower-high rebound, just like the one Bitcoin completed last week. From the April 7 bottom, a 101% rally would put Bitcoin at the $150,000 mark, a clean technical target supported by historical precedent, strong channel support, and renewed breakout momentum. Bitcoin’s next key levels to watch While the outlook is bullish, Finbold reported that analyst Michaël van de Poppe expects a brief consolidation phase, identifying the $107,000 to $108,000 range as an ideal buying opportunity before the next leg higher. Meanwhile, analyst PlanB projects a June closing price of $130,000 if Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) reaches 75. Adding to the optimism, investment firm Bernstein maintains a $200,000 price target, calling it a “high-conviction but conservative” forecast. The firm cites growing institutional demand and broader market maturation. Notably, spot Bitcoin ETFs now manage over $120 billion in assets, highlighting BTC’s transition into a mainstream asset class. Bitcoin price analysis As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $109,493, up more than 2% daily and over 4% weekly. Bitcoin seven-day price chart.

2025-06-10T11:15:00,"Bitcoin’s Supply Squeeze: What Happens When the Entire BTC Supply Disappears From Exchanges?","Bitcoin’s long-term holders have added over $125 billion and are not selling The supply of Bitcoin available on exchanges has dwindled by 35% in a year Signs of institutional buying are providing support despite retail FOMO While Bitcoin’s price consolidates near the critical $110,000 level, a powerful story is unfolding on-chain. Three key trends; massive accumulation by long-term holders, a rapidly shrinking supply on exchanges, and signs of institutional buying, are painting a deeply bullish picture for BTC’s long-term trajectory. As Bitcoin hovers around $109,000, up nearly 4% in the last 24 hours, these underlying metrics suggest a strong foundation is being built for the next major leg up. “Smart Money” Deepens Conviction, Adds $125 Billion in Bitcoin According to on-chain analyst Axel Adler Jr., long-term holders (LTHs), often considered the “smart money” in the market, have added over 1.15 million BTC to their wallets since the price was at the $83,000 level. This staggering accumulation, valued at over $125 billion at current prices, occurred primarily in the $61K–$83K range.

2025-06-10T11:15:00,"Crypto Daybook Americas: BTC Holds Below $110K as QCP Sees ‘Tight Range’; Altcoins Outperform","By James Van Straten (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin BTC treasury-holding companies continue to be a significant driver of momentum as the largest cryptocurrency by market cap trades just below the $110,000 mark, up 2% in the past 24 hours, and just 2% short of the record high it set last month. Even so, it's underperforming the broader market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index, which has gained 3.4%, and ether ETH, which is more than 6% higher, according to CoinDesk data. According to BitcoinTreasuries.net , the number of publicly listed companies holding bitcoin as a treasury asset has risen to 126, that's growth of 22 in just 30 days. Collectively, then own some 819,000 BTC, up 3.25% in the same period. Analysis from Matthew Sigel , the head of digital assets research at VanEck, underscores the growing institutional firepower aimed at bitcoin. He highlights that the combined capital-raising potential of companies such as Strategy (MSTR), Cantor Equity Partners (CEP), Asset Entities (ASST), Semler Scientific (SMLR), Kindly (NAKA), and Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) amounts to $76 billion. That amount represents 56% of the assets under management (AUM) of all bitcoin ETFs and 169% of the total net inflows into these ETFs over the past 16 months. Here's another Illustration of institutional backing: BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) became the fastest fund to surpass $70 billion in AUM, achieving the milestone in just 341 days. That eclipses the record held by SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), which took 1,691 days, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas . On Monday alone, IBIT saw $2.7 billion in trading volume, placing it sixth among all ETFs by daily volume. Still, institutions aren't the only influence. A recent Telegram note from QCP Capital pointed to one-year lows in implied volatility and a pattern of subdued price action, noting that BTC had been “stuck in a tight range” as mid-year approaches. A clean break below $100,000 or above $110,000 is needed to “reawaken broader market interest,” it wrote. Meantime, U.S. CPI, due Wednesday, and any news from the U.S.-China trade talks in London may help provide a stronger direction to the market. Stay alert!

Ether (ETH), meanwhile, increased by 7.3% as daily trading volume more than doubled to $26.5 billion. A breakout for ETH above the $2,650 level of resistance would open a path towards $4,000, where it briefly traded in December before surrendering those gains in February. CoinMarketCap's altcoin season index has ticked up from 18 to 29 out of a maximum 100 since the turn of the month, suggesting that traders are focusing on the altcoin market instead of bitcoion, even though BTC was dominant throughout the recent cycle. Bitcoin has risen by 32% since March, but has been outperformed by a large portion of altcoins including HYPE, SUI and ETH, which are up between 42% and 200% respectively over the same period. Derivatives Positioning Bitcoin options open interest (OI) rose to a June high of $44.33B, led by Deribit at $35.24B, followed by CME ($3.5B) and OKX ($3.24B), according to Coinglass data. The BTC options-to-futures OI ratio stood at 57.6%, reflecting strong demand for optionality relative to directional exposure. Traders continue to lean bullish with a put/call ratio of 0.57 on Deribit. The 140K strike leads in notional terms with $1.79B, while the 27 June expiry dominates the curve with $13.7B in total notional value. The top traded instruments include 120K and 150K calls expiring June and August. Futures open interest momentum remains positive across BTC, AXL and altcoins. AXL’s OI has surged over 800% in the past 24 hours, Velo data shows. BTC funding rates on Deribit reached 36.1% APR, with similarly elevated levels on Hyperliquid (27.5%) and Bybit (11%), highlighting persistent long-side demand. On Binance, liquidation leverage rose sharply to $129.3M near the $106.6K price level, reflecting a cluster of open interest that could be wiped out if prices pull back to that zone, according to Coinglass. Over the past 24 hours, actual BTC liquidations totalled $170.74M, dominated by short liquidations of $160.93M, signaling aggressive forced buying as the price surged through key levels.

A decisive break and hold above this level could open the door for a move back toward the prior range highs between $170 and $180.

Therefore, the BTC price is in an effort to transition into the second phase of price discovery, while the question now appears: Will the bears allow the crypto to surge past $109,800? The two-week Bitcoin downtrend seems to have reached the end as the price has convincingly broken the resistance zone between $106K and $107.6K. Meanwhile, the bulls are working hard to sustain the levels until the daily close, which could validate a positive reclaim signal, as any dip into $106.6K would likely constitute a retest attempt. This rise occurs when BlackRock’s BTC ETF smashes $70 billion in record time and becomes the fastest fund to surpass this milestone. Whales Make Huge Moves While Plebs Sleep The Bitcoin reserve over the exchanges has been constantly dropping since December 2024 and has reached the lowest levels not seen in the past few years. At the same time, the US Bitcoin demand has surged as Coinbase Premium has hit a 4-month high while more than 550K BTC has left the exchanges. This suggests an increase in accumulation, aligning with reduced selling pressure. But the question arises, who is accumulating? Whales or retail investors? In the past few days, the markets witnessed a couple of BTC price movements, as reported by an anonymous analyst, The Data Nerd 2,671 BTC worth around $291.7 million has been transferred from Bitthumb A popular whale, 19JMx, withdrew another 200 BTC from Binance Cucumberland withdrew another 162 BTC worth around $17.7 million This suggests that the whales have begun to make huge moves, as $291M from Bitthum’s cold wallet storage, plus $39.7M worth of BTC exiting Binance and Cumberland. When liquidity providers reshuffle, BTC’s sound money displays strength, which was seen during the latest price rise. Does this suggest the whales are preparing for the next bullish move? Here’s Where the 2025 Bitcoin Top Could Be Bitcoin price just experienced a great short squeeze, clearing the consolidated zone around $106,000. As the bulls are trying extensively to push the price above $110,000, the downside risk after the short squeeze seems to be emerging. However, after a short-term consolidation, the price is expected to rise and mark the market top of 2025. The historical chart of Bitcoin suggests the token still has more room to grow. Whenever the 200-week SMA crosses the previous cycle’s all-time high horizontal level, the top is usually in. This hints towards more upside potential, which could elevate the BTC price towards the 2025 top, somewhere around $160K to $170 in the coming days. Therefore, Bitcoin appears to be under the influence of excessive institutional adoption and whale movements. Hence, the token is expected to maintain a strong ascending trend as it may not allow the price to drop below $100K, or until they book their profits.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-breaking-out-can-the-bulls-drive-the-price-above-110-as-bears-may-be-positioned-at-109-7k/,"BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-06-10T11:00:56,"Massive SBI Circle Investment Fuels USDC Ambitions in Japan","BitcoinWorld Massive SBI Circle Investment Fuels USDC Ambitions in Japan Get ready for a significant development in the Asian digital finance landscape! A major SBI Circle investment is set to accelerate the adoption of the world’s second-largest stablecoin, USDC, within Japan. This move by one of Japan’s financial giants signals growing confidence in stablecoins and their potential role in the future of finance. Understanding the SBI Circle Investment The news broke recently regarding a substantial capital injection into Circle Internet Financial, the issuer behind the popular USDC stablecoin. Two entities from the prominent Japanese financial services conglomerate, SBI Holdings, have collectively poured $50 million into Circle. Specifically, SBI Holdings and its subsidiary, SBI Shinsei Bank, each contributed $25 million. This investment follows Circle’s initial public offering (IPO), indicating a strategic move timed with Circle’s public market debut. This isn’t the first time these two financial powerhouses have joined forces. Earlier this year, SBI and Circle established a joint venture. The primary objective of this collaboration is ambitious: to work diligently towards fostering USDC adoption in Japan and promoting its circulation within the Japanese financial ecosystem. This latest investment can be seen as a strong reinforcement of that existing partnership and a commitment to making that vision a reality. Why is USDC Adoption in Japan Significant? Japan has a unique and often stringent regulatory environment when it comes to cryptocurrencies and digital assets. While it was one of the first countries to recognize Bitcoin as legal property, stablecoins have faced careful scrutiny. Therefore, a concerted effort by major players like SBI Holdings and Circle to push for USDC adoption carries considerable weight. Here are a few reasons why this push for USDC Japan is noteworthy: Regulatory Clarity: Success in navigating Japan’s regulatory framework could set a precedent for other stablecoins and digital assets looking to enter or expand in the market. Market Potential: Japan is a major global economy with a sophisticated financial system. Introducing a widely used stablecoin like USDC could unlock new use cases for digital payments, remittances, and decentralized finance (DeFi). Institutional Backing: The involvement of SBI Holdings, a respected financial institution, lends credibility to USDC and stablecoins in general within Japan, potentially encouraging other businesses and individuals to consider using them. Bridging Traditional and Digital Finance: Partnerships like this help bridge the gap between traditional banking and the burgeoning world of digital assets, facilitating smoother transitions for users and businesses. Circle’s Strategy and the Role of the IPO Circle’s recent moves, including its path towards an IPO, highlight its strategy to become a more integrated and regulated player in the global financial system. Issuing a stablecoin like USDC, which aims for 1:1 parity with the US dollar and is backed by reserves, positions Circle as a key infrastructure provider in the digital economy. The investment from SBI following the IPO demonstrates confidence from traditional finance in Circle’s business model and its future growth prospects. It suggests that major financial institutions see a role for regulated stablecoins like Circle stablecoin (USDC) within their long-term strategies, especially in expanding into digital asset services and cross-border transactions. Impact on the Japan Crypto Market The Japan crypto market has been relatively cautious compared to some other regions, largely due to regulatory factors. However, this partnership and investment could signal a turning point. Here’s how this development might influence the market: Potential Boost for Stablecoin Usage: Increased availability and accessibility of USDC through SBI’s channels. Development of new services and products leveraging USDC within Japan. Potential for increased liquidity and trading pairs on Japanese exchanges. Encouragement for Other Players: Other Japanese financial institutions might explore similar partnerships or stablecoin initiatives. Increased interest from international crypto businesses looking to enter the Japanese market. Regulatory Evolution: The joint venture’s efforts could contribute to ongoing discussions and potential refinements in Japan’s stablecoin regulations. While challenges remain, including navigating specific Japanese financial laws and competing with existing payment systems, the combined strength of SBI Holdings and Circle provides a powerful force to drive adoption. What Does This Mean for You? For individuals and businesses in Japan, this could eventually mean easier access to and use of USDC for various purposes, from international remittances to participating in global DeFi protocols. For crypto enthusiasts and investors worldwide, it signifies the increasing integration of stablecoins into mainstream finance and the growing importance of the Asian market. Keep an eye on how this partnership unfolds. The success of USDC adoption in Japan could serve as a blueprint for stablecoin expansion in other regulated markets globally. A Powerful Partnership Driving Digital Finance Forward The SBI Circle investment is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a strategic alignment between a Japanese financial giant and a leading stablecoin issuer. This partnership, reinforced by the recent $50 million injection post-IPO, is poised to significantly impact the Japan crypto market by accelerating USDC adoption in Japan . As SBI Holdings and Circle work together, they are not only pushing for the circulation of the Circle stablecoin but also helping to shape the future of digital finance in one of the world’s key economies.

ZBX and Naoris Protocol have signed a Memorandum of Understanding that focuses on integrating advanced, post-quantum cybersecurity into ZBX’s infrastructure, crypto.news can exclusively report. Under the agreement, ZBX will use Naoris Protocol’s decentralized protection system, which includes a self-healing security network. The goal is to spot and neutralize attacks in milliseconds, marking a significant speed improvement compared to the current breach detection average of around 272 days. You might also like: We asked an expert about quantum computer threat as Google and BlackRock ring the alarm Preparing for ‘Q-Day’ A key goal of the initiative is to prepare ZBX for a potential future scenario termed “Q‑Day,” when quantum computers will be powerful enough to break current encryption standards. ZBX hopes to secure user assets with post-quantum encryption and use quantum-resistant signatures in all transactions. “The current crypto security paradigm is no longer sufficient,” David Carvalho, Founder of Naoris Protocol, said in the press release. ” Web3 projects still rely heavily on Web2 infrastructure, which creates single points of failure and makes them vulnerable to existing attack vectors and future quantum threats.” This development coincides with instances of rising digital asset theft . Hackers stole more than $2.2 billion from cryptocurrency exchanges in 2024, representing a 21% increase from the prior year. Expectations for a reversal in trends in 2025 and beyond were shattered when Bybit confirmed the theft of $1.5 billion worth of funds, representing the largest crypto heist in history. Security is ‘the foundation’ By combining with Naoris, ZBX hopes to strengthen its position as a MiCA-compliant platform that meets stringent and constant changing regulatory standards while bolstering user trust. “Security isn’t a feature—it’s the foundation,” said ZBX founder Jimmy Zhao. “With Naoris, we’re going beyond the industry standard. We’re making ZBX the safest, most resilient exchange architecture in the world. We are creating a new global standard.” For Naoris Protocol, this marks a high-profile deployment, showcasing that quantum-resilient, decentralized cybersecurity solutions can perform at scale in critical financial environments. Since launching in January 2025, the protocol has processed over 64 million transactions and mitigated 341 million threats, underscoring its capability to deliver security at scale.

2025-06-10T10:54:32,"Bitcoin’s Fate Hangs in the Balance—Breakout or Breakdown Next?","Bitcoin’s current status remains uncertain as inflows shift toward Ethereum , while institutional confidence in BTC appears to waver. Weekly data below from CoinShares shows $286 million in net digital asset inflows, but Bitcoin recorded $8 million in outflows despite broader market optimism. According to CoinShares’ June 7, 2025 report, this marks the seventh consecutive week of positive flows into digital asset investment products. Ethereum led with $321 million in institutional inflows. Over the past six weeks, Ethereum has attracted $1.19 billion. By contrast, Bitcoin has faced consistent selling pressure, even as some firms continue accumulating. Bitcoin began the week on a strong note following institutional accumulation. However, sentiment shifted midweek after a New York court ruled on President Trump’s tariff policy. The market reacted with caution. Bitcoin’s price currently trades near its ATH at $110,000. Though minor, the decline reflects hesitation among institutional investors. Ethereum Pulls Ahead Ethereum’s dominance in institutional products continues to grow. In the last month alone, ETH-related inflows reached $889 million, with total assets under management (AUM) climbing past $14 billion. Spot Ethereum ETFs also saw gains. CoinShares attributes the momentum to rising decentralized finance (DeFi) activity, which remains a key ETH driver. Ethereum gained, XRP recorded $28 million in weekly outflows. This marks a continuation of declining institutional interest in XRP, tied to ongoing regulatory delays. Earlier gains were linked to expectations of a spot XRP ETF approval. However, the SEC’s indecision has slowed that momentum. Still, XRP’s year-to-date position remains in the green. The United States continues to lead in digital asset inflows, recording $199 million last week. However, CoinShares data points to increased activity outside the U.S. Germany brought in $42.9 million, and Australia followed with $21.5 million. Despite Bitcoin’s cooling momentum, institutional players are still adding to their holdings. Michael Saylor’s Strategy acquired 705 BTC , bringing the company’s total to 580,955 BTC. Japan’s Metaplanet also increased its Bitcoin holdings last week, further signaling long-term interest from public firms. Bitcoin Technicals and Market Structure BTC’s price remains volatile. Currently trading around $106,000, it sits just above key technical levels. According to TradingView, Bitcoin is testing resistance between $105,900 and $106,720. A rejection at this level could drop prices to $103,000. However, a sustained move above $105,500 may re-establish bullish momentum above its ATH. Bitcoin’s near-term direction hinges on whether it can reclaim momentum and break resistance or fall into a deeper correction. With Ethereum pulling institutional interest and XRP facing regulatory delays, Bitcoin’s market leadership faces pressure.

2025-06-10T10:50:51,"KULR Technology Group Plans Bold Move: Raising $300M to Buy Bitcoin","BitcoinWorld KULR Technology Group Plans Bold Move: Raising $300M to Buy Bitcoin In a move signaling growing interest from traditional finance in the digital asset space, KULR Technology Group (KULR), a company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, has announced plans to raise a significant amount of capital that could be used to buy Bitcoin . According to a report by CoinDesk, KULR is embarking on a common stock offering aimed at raising up to $300 million. While the funds are earmarked for general corporate purposes, including working capital, a notable allocation mentioned is the potential acquisition of Bitcoin. This announcement places KULR in the spotlight, adding its name to the list of publicly traded companies considering or actively pursuing institutional Bitcoin adoption . Why Would a Company Like KULR Want to Buy Bitcoin? The decision for a technology company like KULR to potentially invest in Bitcoin reflects a broader trend we’ve observed over the past few years. Companies are increasingly exploring Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, a hedge against inflation, or simply as an alternative investment with potential for significant upside. For KULR, which specializes in thermal management and battery safety, this move isn’t directly related to their core business but rather a strategic financial decision. Several factors might influence such a decision: Inflation Hedge: With ongoing concerns about inflation, companies look for assets that can potentially preserve or increase value over time, unlike traditional fiat currencies. Bitcoin’s limited supply is often cited as a key characteristic in this regard. Store of Value: Proponents view Bitcoin as ‘digital gold,’ a decentralized store of value that is not subject to the monetary policies of any single government or central bank. Potential Appreciation: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has shown significant long-term growth potential, attracting companies seeking higher returns than traditional low-yield investments. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin to the corporate balance sheet can offer diversification benefits, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. This potential move by KULR highlights the evolving perception of Bitcoin from a niche technology experiment to a viable, albeit volatile, asset class for corporate treasuries. It’s a significant development for holders of KULR stock and for the crypto market alike. Navigating the Challenges of Corporate Crypto Investment While the potential benefits of holding Bitcoin are attractive, companies venturing into crypto investment face unique challenges. These include: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is notoriously volatile, which can lead to significant fluctuations in the value of a company’s treasury holdings and impact its financial statements. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still developing globally, posing potential risks related to compliance, taxation, and future restrictions. Accounting Treatment: Accounting rules for cryptocurrencies can be complex, often requiring companies to record impairment losses when the price drops, even if they haven’t sold the asset. Security Risks: Safely storing large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security measures to prevent theft or loss of private keys. Shareholder Reaction: Investors in traditional markets may have varying views on a company allocating significant capital to a volatile and relatively new asset class like Bitcoin. Companies like KULR must carefully weigh these risks against the potential rewards and develop a clear strategy for managing their Bitcoin holdings, including custody solutions and accounting practices. KULR Joins the Ranks? Comparing Corporate Bitcoin Strategies KULR’s potential move follows in the footsteps of other notable companies that have allocated significant portions of their treasury reserves to Bitcoin. The most prominent example is MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, which has aggressively accumulated Bitcoin over the past few years, making it a core part of their corporate strategy. Tesla also made headlines when it announced a large Bitcoin purchase in 2021, although its holdings have fluctuated since then. While KULR’s potential $300 million allocation is substantial for the company, it’s worth noting the scale relative to giants like MicroStrategy, which holds billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin. However, any new publicly traded company entering the space contributes to the narrative of increasing institutional Bitcoin adoption and can influence market sentiment. This move by KULR, if finalized with a Bitcoin purchase, serves as another data point indicating that corporate interest in digital assets is not waning and could potentially encourage other firms to explore similar strategies. What Does This Mean for KULR Stock and the Market? For investors in KULR stock , this news introduces a new dimension to the company’s financial strategy. The success or failure of their potential Bitcoin investment could impact shareholder value, separate from the performance of their core technology business. It could attract a new type of investor interested in exposure to Bitcoin through a traditional stock, but it could also deter those who are risk-averse or skeptical of cryptocurrencies. For the broader crypto market, every instance of a publicly traded company deciding to buy Bitcoin is generally seen as a positive signal. It lends legitimacy to the asset class and demonstrates growing institutional confidence. A $300 million purchase, while not the largest seen, is still a significant capital inflow that could potentially impact market dynamics, especially if executed over time. Actionable Insights for Investors For individuals watching this development, here are a few insights: Monitor KULR’s Execution: Keep an eye on official announcements from KULR regarding how and when they might allocate funds to Bitcoin. Understand the Risks: Recognize that corporate Bitcoin holdings add volatility to a company’s financial profile. Research the potential impacts on KULR stock . Broader Trend: See this as part of the larger trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption . This trend is a key factor influencing the long-term outlook for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Diversify Your Own Portfolio: If you are interested in crypto investment , consider your own risk tolerance and diversification strategy rather than solely relying on corporate decisions as investment signals. Conclusion: Another Step Towards Mainstream Adoption KULR Technology Group’s plan to potentially raise $300 million, with a portion possibly allocated to buy Bitcoin , is a notable development in the ongoing story of institutional adoption. While not without risks, the decision reflects a growing corporate willingness to explore digital assets as part of a modern treasury strategy. This move could have implications for both KULR’s future performance and the broader perception and valuation of Bitcoin in the traditional financial world. It underscores the increasing convergence of traditional markets and the crypto space, marking another step towards Bitcoin becoming a more mainstream asset.

No, Paraguay Didn’t Actually Make Bitcoin Legal Tender In a Monday post on X, the president’s official account falsely announced (in English) that Paraguay had made Bitcoin legal tender and established a BTC reserve worth $5 million. It also provided a Bitcoin wallet address for investors to “secure [their] stake” in the project. Peña’s previous posts were all written in Spanish, hence, the latest post raised immediate doubts of a potential hack.

And in 2021, cybercriminals compromised Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s X account to falsely announce the country had made BTC legal tender. More recently, a hacker in the US was able to breach the Securities and Exchange Commission’s X account through a SIM swap attack, falsely announcing the Wall Street regulator had greenlighted the introduction of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on American exchanges. The culprit, Eric Council Jr., was arrested by the FBI and later hit with a 14-month prison sentence for his role in the scheme.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/paraguay-presidents-hacked-x-account-falsely-claims-bitcoin-is-legal-tender/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Paraguay",cryptocompare

A short-term bearish crossover between the 20-day and 50-day EMA bands formed in early June, signaling weakening bullish conviction. Currently, ADA is consolidating within a symmetrical triangle inside the larger wedge pattern. However, short-term bullish momentum returned after June 6, allowing ADA to re-enter the pattern. The move was fueled by renewed optimism in the altcoin market, particularly following its inclusion in the NASDAQ-listed Hashdex ETF with a 1.2% allocation . To confirm a bullish breakout, ADA must close above $0.74 , which could open the path to retest $1.10 —a major resistance level since mid-December 2024.If momentum weakens and selling resumes, ADA could fall toward $0.55 or even $0.40 , key lower support zones. Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) June 2025 $0.40 $0.74 $1.10 ADA Price Prediction 2025 Source: coincarp Cardano has always prioritized decentralization, and the recent Plomin hard fork has taken it a step further. Unlike many other blockchains, Cardano gives more control to its users than to any central organization. This is reflected in CoinCarp’s rich list, where the top 100 addresses hold just 22% of the mainnet’s circulating supply, significantly lower than most other altcoins. To push ADA’s price beyond the $1.10 to $1.20 range, strong retail participation will be necessary. A potential catalyst for this could be the approval of an ADA ETF , which experts believe could launch by the end of this year and attract billions in inflows.If ADA manages to sustain levels above its Q1 2025 high , there’s a solid chance it could retest the $2.05 mark by year-end.

2025-06-10T10:42:06,"Cardano unveils Cardinal to connect Bitcoin users to $334M DeFi ecosystem","Cardano has launched Cardinal, a new protocol aimed at connecting Bitcoin to the Cardano decentralised finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The announcement, made by Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson on 9 June during the Bitcoin 2025 conference, marks a strategic shift to draw liquidity from Bitcoin’s vast network into Cardano’s smart contract infrastructure. Charles Hoskinson @IOHK_Charles · Follow Welcome to the first Bitcoin DeFi protocol developed for Cardano 10:48 PM · Jun 9, 2025 2.0K Reply Copy link Read 64 replies Cardinal enables users to lend, borrow, and stake Bitcoin without leaving the native Bitcoin chain or using traditional custodians. The launch comes as Cardano’s DeFi total value locked (TVL) has dropped from $415 million in May to $334 million as of 10 June, according to DefiLlama . Bitcoin DeFi integration without bridges or custodians Cardinal is designed to bring Bitcoin into the DeFi space by wrapping unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) and converting them into tokens that are pegged 1:1 with Bitcoin. This lets Bitcoin holders use their assets on Cardano’s platform without relying on centralised bridges or custodians. The process is trust-minimised, allowing users to reclaim their Bitcoin at any time through a secure and verifiable method. Unlike traditional wrapped BTC protocols that often depend on a central authority, Cardinal operates using MuSig2, a multi-signature cryptographic scheme. This technique enables multiple participants to cooperatively sign transactions, while maintaining Bitcoin’s security guarantees. As long as at least one party in the network behaves honestly, the system remains secure, and the wrapped Bitcoin stays locked on the native chain. No rehypothecation, more asset control for users One of Cardinal’s main differentiators is its stance on rehypothecation. In many financial systems, custodians re-use deposited assets—often without full user awareness. Cardinal eliminates this risk by preventing intermediaries from controlling user assets, giving holders complete visibility and ownership throughout the DeFi process. Cardinal’s smart contract framework avoids unnecessary centralisation by leveraging BitVMX—an off-chain computation protocol. BitVMX allows users to perform complex operations involving Bitcoin, without needing to compromise on decentralisation. When paired with Cardano’s Plutus smart contracts, this configuration allows seamless asset movement between the two blockchains. Live BTC-Cardano transfer demo showcases use case At the Bitcoin 2025 event, Input Output (IO), the research and development firm behind Cardano, demonstrated a bridgeless BTC-to-Cardano asset transfer using Cardinal and BitVMX. The live demonstration served as a proof-of-concept, underscoring Cardinal’s capacity to bring Bitcoin-native liquidity to Cardano’s DeFi platforms. This move comes at a time when Cardano is aiming to boost its TVL and regain DeFi traction. According to DefiLlama, Cardano’s DeFi market has seen a decline in locked value since its May peak. By offering Bitcoin users direct DeFi access without leaving their native network, Cardinal could provide the liquidity injection needed to revive activity on the Cardano chain. Market impact and future roadmap Cardano’s DeFi infrastructure has historically struggled to match Ethereum’s or Solana’s dominance. However, Cardinal represents a new model for integrating Bitcoin in a non-custodial, decentralised way. The protocol not only enables secure lending and borrowing with wrapped Bitcoin, but also introduces interoperability across ecosystems—one of the key bottlenecks for DeFi expansion. Input Output has not yet announced a full-scale rollout date but plans to continue testing Cardinal under real-world conditions. The team will likely focus on increasing Cardinal’s adoption among Bitcoin users looking for DeFi exposure without compromising on custody or decentralisation. The move also reflects a broader trend in the DeFi space, where newer protocols are prioritising asset sovereignty, cryptographic security, and interoperability. If successful, Cardinal could set a precedent for how major blockchain ecosystems integrate Bitcoin, and how Bitcoin evolves from a passive store of value to an active player in decentralised finance.

In less than a year since its launch, this investment vehicle has reached an astounding milestone, signaling a massive shift in how traditional finance views and accesses the cryptocurrency market. This isn’t just another fund; it’s setting records at an unprecedented pace. BlackRock IBIT Reaches Unprecedented Heights The headline speaks volumes: BlackRock IBIT has officially crossed the $70 billion mark in assets under management (AUM). What makes this figure particularly impactful isn’t just the number itself, but the speed at which it was accumulated. According to Bloomberg ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas, who shared the data on X (formerly Twitter), IBIT hit this impressive AUM total in a mere 341 days from its inception. Balchunas didn’t stop there. He highlighted the significance of this achievement, stating that it makes IBIT the Fastest Growing ETF ever recorded within that specific timeframe. Think about that for a moment – out of thousands of ETFs launched over the years, none have gathered assets this quickly in their first year. How Does IBIT’s Growth Compare? To truly appreciate the scale of IBIT’s rapid ascent, it helps to put it into perspective. One of the most common comparisons for a Spot Bitcoin ETF is against established commodity ETFs, particularly those tracking gold. The SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) is the world’s largest spot gold ETF and a benchmark for asset gathering in the commodity space. Here’s where IBIT’s performance becomes even more striking: IBIT reached its current size five times faster than GLD did during its initial growth phase. GLD, launched in 2004, took years to accumulate the level of assets IBIT has gathered in under 11 months. This comparison underscores the unique market dynamics at play and the pent-up demand for accessible Crypto Investment opportunities within traditional investment frameworks. Why is BlackRock IBIT Growing So Fast? Several factors are likely contributing to the phenomenal success of the BlackRock IBIT fund: BlackRock’s Reputation: As the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock brings immense trust, credibility, and distribution power. Investors comfortable with BlackRock’s traditional offerings are more likely to invest in their crypto product. Accessibility: A Spot Bitcoin ETF provides a straightforward way for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without the complexities of buying, storing, or securing the actual cryptocurrency. It can be bought and sold like any stock through standard brokerage accounts. Market Timing: The launch coincided with renewed positive sentiment around Bitcoin, partly fueled by the anticipation and approval of these very ETFs. Institutional Interest: While retail investors are certainly participating, a significant portion of the inflows is believed to come from institutional players who now have a regulated and familiar vehicle to allocate capital to Bitcoin. Performance of Bitcoin: The underlying asset, Bitcoin, has seen significant price appreciation, which naturally increases the AUM of the fund holding it. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investment and the Market? The rapid growth of IBIT, alongside other successful spot Bitcoin ETF s launched simultaneously, has profound implications: Increased Legitimacy: The sheer volume of money flowing into these regulated products signals growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class by mainstream finance and investors. Bridging the Gap: ETFs like IBIT act as a crucial bridge, connecting traditional financial markets with the nascent world of cryptocurrency. Potential for Further Growth: The ease of access provided by the Fastest Growing ETF could attract even more capital from individuals and institutions who were previously hesitant to enter the crypto space directly. Impact on Bitcoin Price: The consistent buying pressure from these ETFs, including BlackRock IBIT , is a significant factor influencing Bitcoin’s supply and demand dynamics, potentially impacting its price. Considering a Spot Bitcoin ETF? What You Should Know For investors looking at IBIT or other spot Bitcoin ETF s as a way to add crypto exposure to their portfolio, here are a few points to consider: Volatility: While ETFs offer convenience, the underlying asset (Bitcoin) remains highly volatile. The value of your investment can fluctuate significantly. Fees: ETFs charge management fees, which can eat into returns over time. Compare fees across different providers. Not Direct Ownership: Investing in an ETF means you own shares in the fund, not actual Bitcoin. This is important if direct control or potential future staking/yield opportunities are a priority. Due Diligence: Understand the fund’s structure, holdings, and the risks associated with investing in cryptocurrency before committing capital. The Future is Bright for Crypto Investment Accessibility The success of BlackRock IBIT as the Fastest Growing ETF is more than just a financial statistic; it’s a landmark event in the history of Crypto Investment . It demonstrates strong market demand for regulated, accessible Bitcoin products and highlights the increasing integration of digital assets into the global financial system. While challenges and market volatility remain, the rapid adoption of vehicles like the Spot Bitcoin ETF offered by BlackRock suggests a future where crypto assets play a more prominent role in diversified investment portfolios.

2025-06-10T10:35:39,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Axelar, Hyperliquid lead crypto bounce ahead of Fed meeting","The cryptocurrency market is regaining its bullish momentum, with major tokens like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Axelar (AXL), and Hyperliquid (HYPE) posting impressive gains as investors brace for the Federal Reserve’s pivotal June 18 meeting. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has climbed 3.5% to trade at $109,376, while Ethereum has surged 7.5% to $2,677.46, reinforcing a broader recovery trend following recent selling pressure. Axelar has emerged as one of today’s crypto top performers, rallying by an astonishing 90.2% in a single day and nearly doubling its price to $0.6041, underscoring renewed appetite for interoperability-focused projects. Hyperliquid also joined the rally, gaining 11.1% to trade at $39.29, further extending its weekly rise to 8.7%, supported by a growing narrative around decentralized liquidity protocols. Notably, these cryptocurrencies are leading a pack of other coins as the cryptocurrency market rebound after a slight dip over the weekend and into Monday. Amid this bounce back, the global market cap has jumped to $3.38 trillion. US-China trade talks optimism spurs BTC’s bullish momentum Bitcoin’s recovery follows a multi-day consolidation and reflects growing confidence as short-term headwinds appear to be fading. Fueled by a renewed wave of optimism around US-China trade talks , BTC rose nearly 4% since Monday, reversing losses triggered by cautious sentiment earlier this month. The latest round of trade negotiations in London has reignited hopes of tariff relief, boosting overall risk appetite across financial markets. Historically, positive developments in US-China relations have triggered broad-based rallies in equities and digital assets alike, and this round is proving no different. As a result, investors are reallocating capital from traditional safe-haven assets into high-yield instruments, with Bitcoin sitting at the forefront of that shift. Additionally, technical indicators such as the breakout from a bull flag pattern point to a potential price target near $158,000, giving traders a compelling reason to stay bullish. Ethereum is riding the institutional optimism Ethereum (ETH) has significantly outperformed Bitcoin (BTC) over the past day, rallying over 7% and strengthening its position above $2,670. The rise in ETH reflects increasing institutional confidence, with many traders interpreting the improved regulatory environment as a green light for broader altcoin exposure. Recent commentary from SEC Chairman Paul Atkins supporting DeFi self-custody rights has fueled this sentiment, offering clarity long sought by crypto-native developers and investors. Furthermore, Ethereum’s ecosystem is benefiting from heightened activity around staking and layer-2 adoption, helping reinforce its long-term growth narrative. As Bitcoin ETFs expand, some institutions are now exploring Ethereum allocations as a natural extension of their crypto strategies. Axelar explosion pegged on the hype around its platform Axelar’s 90.2% daily surge is among the most notable market moves this week, catapulting its market cap to $569 million amid explosive volume of over $353 million. The token’s sharp rally appears driven by a growing narrative around blockchain interoperability and the increasing importance of cross-chain communication protocols. As developers search for scalable and seamless ways to connect disparate blockchain ecosystems, Axelar’s value proposition is coming into sharper focus. Market participants are also speculating on the project’s potential involvement in broader institutional frameworks, adding fuel to an already accelerating rally. The 79.8% weekly gain further signals sustained buying pressure, pointing to continued confidence among both retail and strategic investors. Hyperliquid is extending its gains as DeFi rotation picks up Hyperliquid’s 11.1% daily rise builds on a strong weekly performance, with its price now hovering near $39.29 and its market cap topping $13 billion. The surge reflects renewed interest in DeFi-native tokens, particularly those focused on liquidity provision, decentralized exchanges, and derivative markets. Traders have increasingly turned to HYPE as a proxy for broader participation in decentralized financial infrastructure amid mounting skepticism toward centralized platforms. As derivative volumes climb and open interest continues to grow, projects like Hyperliquid are drawing in fresh capital, benefiting from structural tailwinds. The token’s rising price and expanding market cap suggest investors are positioning for further growth in decentralized trading ecosystems. FOMC uncertainty is fueling the crypto momentum While the various cryptocurrencies including Axelar, Hyperliquid, Bitcoin, Ethereum and others like Fartcoin and dogwifhat that have also seen double digit gains, are rebounding strongly, underlying macroeconomic tensions remain in play ahead of the Federal Reserve’s June 18 meeting. The CME FedWatch Tool shows a near-unanimous 99.9% expectation that interest rates will remain steady, driven by strong job data and sticky inflation. Despite external pressure, including rate cuts from the European Central Bank and vocal demands from Donald Trump, the Fed is unlikely to shift policy just yet. This policy consistency has brought some temporary relief to the crypto market, which often reacts sharply to changes in interest rate outlooks. At the same time, analysts are warning that certain bearish signals, such as a potential head and shoulders pattern on Bitcoin’s chart, could still drag prices lower. Nonetheless, with derivatives volume surging and over $195 million in shorts liquidated in the last 24 hours alone, bulls currently hold the upper hand. Crypto market outlook hinges on Fed and CPI data Looking forward, the crypto market’s resilience will be tested further as investors await both the FOMC decision and new inflation data from the Consumer Price Index. Should inflation cool and the Fed hold rates steady, the existing rally may extend, particularly if macro sentiment continues to favor risk assets. However, a surprise from either event could spark renewed volatility, keeping traders on edge despite the recent bullish surge. For now, Axelar, Hyperliquid, Bitcoin, and Ethereum are leading the charge, suggesting that investor sentiment is growing increasingly optimistic as the crypto market navigates a delicate macroeconomic landscape.

2025-06-10T10:34:53,"Hackers Target Paraguayan President’s X Account in Bitcoin Legal Tender Scam","A false announcement claiming Paraguay had adopted Bitcoin as legal tender was posted from President Santiago Peña’s hacked X account, prompting swift clarification from the government and raising concerns over digital platform vulnerabilities. Bitcoin Community Misled by Presidential Account Hack A fraudulent post from Paraguayan President Santiago Peña’s personal X account caused a brief stir across the cryptocurrency world on Monday. The post, written in English, falsely declared that Paraguay had made Bitcoin legal tender and had established a $5 million BTC reserve, even including a wallet address for alleged “investment” purposes. The post read, ""Investors: your investment today will determine the scale of this rollout. Secure your stake in Bitcoin."" This messaging marked a stark departure from Peña’s typical posts, which are almost exclusively in Spanish. Government Responds Swiftly The excitement surrounding the announcement was short-lived. Paraguay’s presidential office quickly issued a statement from its official X account, confirming that the president’s personal account had been accessed by an unauthorized party. Citizens were urged to disregard any unverified posts from Peña’s profile until the matter was resolved. The presidential office noted it was working with X to “clarify the situation” and reminded the public that only information disseminated through verified government channels should be trusted. Peña Acknowledges Breach Hours after the fraudulent post was taken down, President Peña addressed the breach in a new message from his restored account. He thanked both Paraguay’s Cyber Incident Response Team (CERTpy) and X’s internal security team for their role in handling the incident: “I express my appreciation to the CERTpy and X teams for their quick and professional response to the security incident on my official X account. Cybersecurity is key, and these events show us that we must all contribute to building a safe, reliable, and resilient digital ecosystem.” As of publication, the misleading post had been deleted while the government’s statement remains live on the platform. Broader Concerns Over Crypto Scams The incident highlights ongoing concerns about the use of social media platforms like X.com as vectors for crypto scams. High-profile figures have frequently been targeted by hackers to promote false crypto announcements. In 2021, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s account was similarly compromised to claim that India had adopted Bitcoin as legal tender. In another case, the U.S. SEC’s X account was breached earlier this year through a SIM-swap attack that led to the false announcement of BTC ETF approvals. Paraguay’s Crypto Status Although Paraguay has attracted notable Bitcoin mining activity, particularly from firms like HIVE, the country has not taken formal steps toward adopting Bitcoin as legal tender. Unlike El Salvador, which did so in 2021 under President Nayib Bukele, Paraguay has yet to establish a comprehensive crypto regulatory framework. The false post coincided with renewed regional discussions on digital assets, spurred in part by El Salvador’s ongoing Bitcoin experiment and its complex negotiations with the International Monetary Fund.

2025-06-10T10:30:55,"Why The Bitcoin Price Could See Another 70%-170% Jump From Here","The Bitcoin price is still holding above $100,000 despite suffering a crash right before the weekend. It has since bounced back from the $104,000 level, suggesting that bulls are making their stand at this major psychological level. Now, with the crypto market sitting at what looks to be a critical point, questions are arising about what the next step could be from here. Can Bitcoin still rally, or is this the end of a rather short and underwhelming bull market? Bitcoin Price Still Has A Long Way To Go Crypto analyst Doctor Profit has been a vocal voice when it comes to the bullishness of the Bitcoin price. He has continued to call for higher prices even at a time when the wider community is expecting the cryptocurrency to keep falling from here. In fact, the crypto analyst believes that the leading crypto could see its price double from here, despite already hitting multiple new all-time highs. Related Reading: Ethereum Head & Shoulders Pattern Breakdown: Can Bulls Reclaim Control? In a post on X, Doctor Profit explained the reasoning behind this and why he believes that the Bitcoin price still has room to run. The first thing he pointed to was the fact that a rare Golden Cross had appeared on the Bitcoin price chart. This happened three weeks ago, and back then, the analyst called out the chart formation, explaining that this meant that the bull run was not over. This is because every time Bitcoin had flashed a Golden Cross in the past, it had been the start of another massive run. Just like now, it is first followed by a 10% decline in price, which was achieved when Bitcoin fell from $111,900 to $100,000. Now that the first part of the trend seems to have been fulfilled, expectations are that the other parts will play out similarly. In addition to this, he explains that Bitcoin has also formed its diagonal resistance, which it is now looking to break out from. A successful break would put it back above $108,000 as it gears up for the next leg-up. Macro Factors That Support The Thesis Not only does the chart technicals show this possible recovery, but the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, expected to be released on Wednesday, plays into this as well. Doctor Profit explains that Wall Street is already expecting the CPI to come in at 2.5%, a rather high number. Related Reading: Dogecoin’s Growth Pattern Hints At Massive June–July Rally After 5-Month Pullback Instead, he believes that the CPI will come in lower, putting it between 2.1% and 2.3%. A lower figure would mean that there is a slowdown in inflation, allowing room for more risk-taking and pushing markets such as stocks and crypto higher. Also, there is the matter of the negative funding rate, which suggests that there are more shorters in the market right now, expecting the price to tank. Data from Coinglass shows the Bitcoin funding rate has dropped to one of the lowest levels this year, and the analyst says this is a sign of a healthy market. “Overall, I see a strong trend and markets will continue to rise with first targets between 108-110k, and this is by far not the end,” Doctor Profit said. “The golden cross is promising us between 70-170% in gains in the coming months!” Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-70-170-jump/,"BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT",cryptocompare

2025-06-10T10:26:26,"Bitcoin Nears Record High, But Analysts Warn of Looming Correction","Bitcoin is closing in on its all-time high of $111,970 , trading at $109,519 at the time of writing. While the milestone appears within reach, analysts warn that the cryptocurrency may struggle to push higher without a meaningful catalyst. In a report published Monday, Bitfinex analysts highlighted growing risks of a short-term correction, cautioning that the current rally lacks fundamental support. “The risk of a short-term correction continues to build — especially in the absence of a strong catalyst to push Bitcoin decisively above the current all-time high,” they said. The analysts pointed to long-term holders, many of whom bought in Q1 2025 when BTC dipped as low as $78,513, as critical to the market’s next move. Those investors are now sitting on gains of around 39%, and whether they choose to take profits or hold could determine Bitcoin’s near-term direction. Decision Time for Long-Term Holders As Bitcoin flirts with its all-time high , holders from earlier in the year are faced with a pivotal choice. “Market participants still holding coins from Q1 2025, and who held through the sharp drawdown below $80,000, are now being tested as the price churns sideways near ATH levels,” Bitfinex noted. The firm warned that if long-term holders start selling in large numbers, Bitcoin could enter a prolonged consolidation phase — something it has done in the past. In 2024, Bitcoin hit a then-record of $73,679 in March but traded sideways for months before gaining momentum again after the U.S. presidential election in November. Adding to market tension, CoinGlass data shows that roughly $1.08 billion in short positions could be liquidated if BTC breaks above its previous high, potentially triggering rapid price moves in either direction. Bitcoin Traders Await Fed Decision and Political Clarity Macro events may be the deciding factor in Bitcoin’s next big move. The Federal Reserve is scheduled to announce its next interest rate decision on June 18. Any hint of rate cuts could act as a bullish trigger for BTC and other risk-on assets. Meanwhile, geopolitical uncertainty continues to cloud investor sentiment. Swyftx lead analyst Pav Hundal noted that persistent tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump could stall the BTC rally. “The biggest threat to bulls right now is that nothing changes over the next two months, and we just stay trapped in this cycle of endless tariff ultimatums,” Hundal said.

2025-06-10T10:21:10,"Top 7 Reasons Why the Ethereum Price Rally is Coming Soon","The post Top 7 Reasons Why the Ethereum Price Rally is Coming Soon appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum may be under pressure on the charts, but behind the scenes, bullish signals are rapidly stacking up. Despite a 1.82% drop today and a 26.75% decline over the past year, a prominent crypto analyst known as Unipcs—also referred to as “ Bonk Guy “—has outlined several key factors that could spark a powerful ETH rally. Ethereum ETFs See Massive Inflows One of the most bullish trends cited by Bonk Guy is the consistent inflow into Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). According to Coinglass data, ETH ETFs have now posted 15 consecutive days of positive inflows. BlackRock’s ETHA led with $35.2 million in a single day Fidelity’s FETH followed with $12.9 million Grayscale’s ETH added $4.6 million On June 3 alone , ETH ETFs recorded a massive $109.5 million in inflows—marking the highest single-day inflow for Ethereum ETFs so far this month. Corporates Are Holding Ethereum Bonk Guy notes a shift among institutions adopting Ethereum as a treasury asset. In a headline-grabbing move, SharpLink Gaming closed a $425 million private placement , led by ConsenSys Software Inc, to implement one of the largest Ethereum treasury strategies in public markets. This signals growing corporate confidence in ETH, mirroring the Bitcoin-focused approach seen with MicroStrategy. ETH Staking Approval in ETFs May Be Near Regulatory signals suggest that ETH staking could soon be allowed in ETF structures. If approved, it could unlock significant institutional inflows and act as a major bullish catalyst for Ethereum. Short Squeeze Ahead? The analyst also pointed out that many funds and traders are currently shorting ETH. Should the price reverse upward, it could trigger a short squeeze , amplifying gains as traders rush to cover positions. Meanwhile, weekly active Ethereum addresses have hit record highs, showing surging user engagement and strengthening the case for long-term growth. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Arthur Hayes Predicts Bitcoin Surge If Bank of Japan Eases Policy , ETH Supply on Exchanges Is Shrinking Ethereum supply on exchanges is dropping fast—a sign that traders are moving assets to cold storage or staking, reducing sell pressure. Notable 30-day ETH outflows include: Bitfinex : -572,946 ETH Coinbase Pro : -2,149 ETH OKX : -13,627 ETH Kraken : -6,428 ETH Bithumb : -19,572 ETH In total, top exchanges including Binance and Coinbase saw a combined decline of over 261,000 ETH . All-Time High Staking and Layer 2 Boom The Ethereum ecosystem is also expanding, with over 34.6 million ETH now staked , locking up a significant portion of supply. Moreover, Layer 2 networks like Base are showing explosive growth, pointing to increasing scalability and mainstream adoption. Bottom Line: While Ethereum’s price performance may look disappointing in the short term, on-chain data, ETF inflows, treasury adoption, and growing network activity all hint at a potential breakout rally on the horizon. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Accordingly, Hoskinson announced the launch of Cardinal, the first Bitcoin DeFi protocol on the Cardano network. Cardano has launched the Cardinal Protocol for Bitcoin (BTC) DeFi. Cardano now enables BTC lending, staking, and more without central custody and without the need for third-party custodians. The Cardinal Protocol allows users to put their Bitcoin to work by lending, borrowing, or staking on the Cardano blockchain. Related News: Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson Talks About Bitcoin (BTC), ADA, and XRP! Outlines His Plans! Cardinal is seen as a groundbreaking innovation for BTC and ADA, being the first solution to allow Bitcoin to access the Cardano ecosystem without requiring custody. Finally, it was noted that Cardinal uses the secure MuSig2 multi-signature system. This method enables peg-in and peg-out transactions, keeps everything open and verifiable, and is also compatible with the Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Avalanche (AVAX) networks. Cardano CTO Romain Pellerin said that Cardinal Protocol is a big step forward and that there are some new innovations on the way. Future upgrades could include wallet support, zero-knowledge proofs, and deeper liquidity. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-10T10:12:32,"Arthur Hayes Predicts Bitcoin Surge If Bank of Japan Eases Policy","The post Arthur Hayes Predicts Bitcoin Surge If Bank of Japan Eases Policy appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX, suggested that if Japan’s top bank, the Bank of Japan (BoJ), decides to boost the economy by printing more money instead of trying to slow down rising prices, it might set Bitcoin and Ethereum up for a big jump. Let’s see why! BoJ’s Big Decision on June 17th For a long time, the BoJ has been strict, saying that inflation is still above where they’d like it to be. But with the central bank’s next big meeting coming up on June 17th , Hayes sees a chance for a different approach. He believes that if the BoJ stops tightening its money policy and goes back to helping the economy by printing more money (quantitative easing, or QE), then Bitcoin could surge higher . This isn’t just about Bitcoin. Hayes pointed out that while some people in Japan might not like the idea of easier money, it could mean good news for risky assets in general. What’s Going on in Japan? Japan has been known for keeping its interest rates low for a long time compared to other countries like the U.S. and Europe. This helps families and companies borrow money easily, but it also makes Japan’s money, the yen, weaker. A weaker yen means that things that Japan buys from other countries get more expensive. Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda has hinted that they’re not rushing to tighten money conditions, which could continue until 2026. Since other big central banks, like the U.S. Federal Reserve, have been raising rates, Japan’s slow pace of change is giving investors a chance to borrow yen at lower costs. Many see this as a way to invest in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which is seen as a safer haven during inflation. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Top 7 Reasons Why the Ethereum Price Rally is Coming Soon , Money Flowing Into Bitcoin If Japan decides to change its money policy, it could trigger another big pump in crypto.

2025-06-10T10:10:17,"Here’s Why XRP is Already Pricing Out retail investors","Concerns have emerged in the XRP community, as more investors point out that retail buyers are quickly losing the chance to own meaningful amounts of the asset. Edoardo Farina, founder of Alpha Lions Academy, rejuvenated the conversation with a recent video where he discussed why most XRP holders will struggle to keep up in the long run.Farina Reveals Why Retailers Are Getting Priced Out of XRPNotably, Farina once believed that 95% of XRP holders would fall behind. Now, after traveling to more than 20 countries and talking to people everywhere from South America to Europe, he thinks the number will rise to 99%. The market pundit explained that rising costs and economic pressure are forcing people to sell off their XRP just to cover everyday expenses. Discouragingly, this is no longer about buying new cars or luxury items, as many are selling just to buy groceries or pay rent.He pointed out how the cost of living keeps rising, while wages and savings don't keep pace. According to Farina, even Americans, who live in one of the world's wealthiest countries, often don't have $10,000 in savings. This makes owning large amounts of XRP, like 10,000 tokens , out of reach for most. With current prices, that amount costs over $20,000, making it a goal that used to feel realistic but now seems far-fetched. Farina said even 1,000 XRP is now becoming a stretch for average buyers.A Concerning Global Economic TrendSpeaking further, he asked whether crypto prices are really climbing or if the value of fiat money is just falling. As inflation eats away at purchasing power, most people can no longer afford to hold their investments. They're cashing out, not by choice but out of necessity. Now, while that is happening, the market keeps moving. XRP's price continues to climb, and Farina believes those who sell now will find it much harder, or even impossible, to buy back later.Farina urged investors to get creative instead of selling. He shared his own story of moving from northern Italy to Greece, where he cut living costs dramatically and used the savings to invest in crypto. He encouraged people to consider side gigs, change locations if needed, and make better use of the internet to earn income. The pundit believes that taking these steps now could make the difference between financial freedom and being left behind.XRP Community ReactsHowever, Australian lawyer Bill Morgan pushed back on Farina's claims. He questioned the idea of getting priced out entirely, saying that people can always buy $100 worth of XRP today, and they'll still be able to do that in the future. https://twitter.com/Belisarius2020/status/1932257552596975953Essentially, Morgan pointed out that trading doesn't stop, and anyone can buy small amounts, regardless of the token's price.Responding to the attorney, Nick, a crypto investor and the founder of Web3Alert, said it's not about whether someone can buy $100 worth, but how much that $100 can actually get them. According to Nick, in 2020, he could easily buy 10,000 XRP at prices between $0.11 and $0.20. That's no longer the case. He believes XRP, like Bitcoin, has already moved out of reach for regular people looking to build life-changing positions.Meanwhile, well-known XRP community figure Alex Cobb said in a separate commentary that he remembers when $100 bought 400 XRP.

2025-06-10T10:00:59,"Perfect Storm Of Fundamentals And Technicals Puts XRP Price At $10 – Details","The XRP price and its trajectory have been one of the most debated in the crypto community after a rapid surge that saw its price rise 600% back in 2024. Since then, the altcoin has slowed down and has been skirting support around the $2 level, with bears unable to break this level so far. With support holding so strong, expectations are that a renewed and sustained bullish momentum will begin, and this time, analysts are putting the XRP price in the double-digits. XRP Price Forms Classic Bullish Flag Pattern Crypto analyst Persian Blockchain has made bold predictions for the XRP price as the altcoin has seen the formation os a classic bullish flag pattern. This pattern emerged with the rise and subsequent fall in the XRP price and has continued to show signs of more bullishness to come. One important factor that the crypto analyst points out is the fact that classic bullish flag patterns are a continuation structure. This means they often signal the start of an upward movement, most likely to push toward the previous peaks seen with the last rally . As expected, there are still some resistances on the chart that the XRP price will have to clear. In this case, the crypto analyst highlights a level like the $2.7 resistance, which is the level to beat. As they explain, if the XRP price is able to successfully break above the resistance and then enter the buy zone, then a breakout could be expected. The crypto analyst said: “A retest of the breakout area followed by bullish confirmation could signal the beginning of a larger move toward the $10 psychological level.” This would mean an over 400% move from the altcoin to push it toward brand new all-time highs. Ripple Vs. SEC Lawsuit Plays A Role So far, the long-running Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit has played a huge role in suppressing the XRP price over the years, and even now, continues to loom over the digital asset. There is yet to be a final conclusion to the legal battle, although the court’s rulings have been leaning toward a favorable outcome for Ripple. The crypto analyst points to the SEC’s 60-day deadline coming to an end on June 16, and if the courts rule in favour of Ripple, then this could spark a fresh rally. Moreover, there has also been a rise in global liquidity, and as the stock market and Bitcoin are expected to rise, the XRP price will rise in tandem as one of the largest cryptocurrencies in the market. A positive outcome and final conclusion to the SEC battle would renew confidence in XRP and possibly drive new investments. “The alignment of a legal breakthrough, improving macro liquidity, and a bullish chart structure makes this a scenario worth watching closely,” the analyst concluded.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-at-10-details/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","XRP|crypto|crypto news|ripple|ripple news|Ripple price|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT",cryptocompare

2025-06-10T09:59:05,"Bitcoin Flirts With $107K as Trade-Talk Optimism Fuels Risk Rally","Bitcoin price today sits at $109,377 with the U.S.–China trade talks igniting investor sentiment about the possibility of easing global trade tensions. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Inflows Skyrocket BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has set a new record by becoming the fastest ETF ever to surpass $70 billion in assets under management, reaching this milestone in just 341 trading days since its launch. Calling out this development, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas pointed out , “ IBIT just blew through $70b and is now the fastest ETF to ever hit that mark in only 341 days, which is 5x faster than the old record held by GLD of 1,691 days.” Consider this, the previous record-holder, SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), needed 1,691 days to hit $70 billion. IBIT achieved the same feat about five times faster, illustrating a high adoption rate. BlackRock’s IBIT now holds over 660,000 BTC—outpacing MicroStrategy’s 582,000 and inching closer to Satoshi Nakamoto’s legendary 1.12 million. This milestone aligns with growing institutional interest, as crypto ETFs saw a $224 million inflow last week, driven by strong IBIT performance. With a 2023 NBER study suggesting that institutional buying could stabilize crypto markets in the long term, ETFs will continue to be a game-changer in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Meanwhile, a supply shock looms in the BTC network with exchange balances recently hitting a 7-year low, hinting at a growing hodling trend. Therefore, heigthened ETF inflows, robust institutional interest, and the possibility of a supply shock continue to paint a bullish Bitcoin picture. Bitcoin Enthusiasts Keep Fingers Crossed about the U.S.–China Trade Talks The ongoing U.S.–China trade talks are injecting a fresh dose of optimism into global markets, with Bitcoin among the major beneficiaries. Market analysts point to easing trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies as a key driver behind Bitcoin’s recent surge, which saw the flagship cryptocurrency rebound to the psychological price of $110,000. This has spurred positive sentiment among investors seeking refuge in alternative assets like Bitcoin, which historically performs well amid economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Experts say the renewed optimism stems from expectations that a thaw in trade tensions could stabilize global supply chains, reduce inflationary pressures, and bolster risk-on assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies. “When trade tensions ease, investors tend to rotate capital into higher-risk, higher-reward assets,” explains Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors. “Bitcoin stands to benefit from that tailwind.” On the macroeconomic front, traders are closely watching the Federal Reserve’s signals. While the Fed has kept interest rates steady at 4.25% since April, the market is now pricing in a potential rate cut by September, adding to the bullish sentiment for risk assets like Bitcoin. With U.S.–China trade negotiations progressing, supply chain issues easing, Bitcoin enthusiasts are betting on a sustained rally. Conclusion With Bitcoin being a stone’s throw away from reclaiming its historical price of $111,814 bullish sentiments continue to rock its ecosystem. For instance, BlackRock is leading the pack in terms of soaring Bitcoin ETF inflows, illustrating heightened institutional adoption. With the world’s largest cryptocurrency expected to be a major beneficiary of the trade talks between China and the U.S., it might be a matter of time before BTC sets a new price record, which might ignite a crypto market rally.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9507/bitcoin-flirts-with-107-k-as-trade-talk-optimism-fuels-risk-rally,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

Dogecoin added over 5% to trade near 19 cents as of Asian afternoon hours Tuesday, while Cardano’s ADA rose more than 5% as risk appetite returned after last week’s volatility. Overall market capitalization rose more than 3%, with the broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) adding 4%. The rebound came as traders continued to digest the latest US-China trade developments and braced for key inflation data this week that could set the tone for interest rate expectations. “Bitcoin surged to around $110K as US-China trade talks resumed while the SEC greenlights new crypto ETFs, giving investors a renewed bullish sentiment,” said Augustine Fan, Head of Insights at SignalPlus, in an email to CoinDesk. “We anticipate a continuation of the bullish trends as crypto attracts more institutions and retail investors with innovations and competitive returns.” Kay Lu, CEO of HashKey Eco Labs, said the market’s reaction to the Trump-Musk spat last week may have been overdone. “We’re seeing some market recovery as fundamentals remain strong,” Lu said. “The CPI data on Wednesday could be a key catalyst for price moves.” Meanwhile, Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE, warned that the current cycle may not be straightforward. “We’re seeing more options for investors to get crypto exposure, whether through ETFs, corporate treasuries, or stablecoin issuers,” Mei said. “This cycle will be more nuanced as crypto matures as a macro asset class.” Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, noted that Bitcoin’s price action above $109,000 showed resilience in the face of mixed signals. “Bitcoin’s climb amid geopolitical and macro headwinds reinforces its standing as a macro asset class,” Ruck said. “ETF momentum has put crypto back on the radar for mainstream investors.”",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/10/what-next-as-ether-zooms-7-doge-leads-majors-gains-amid-bitcoin-euphoria,"BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|Markets|Trading|DOGE|Ether|News",cryptocompare
