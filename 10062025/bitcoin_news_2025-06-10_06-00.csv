2025-06-10T03:30:51,"On-Chain Data Flashes Bullish: Is Bitcoin Ready for a $110K Comeback?","Bitcoin has resumed its upward trajectory, registering a modest 1.6% gain over the last 24 hours to trade at $107,428. The recovery comes after last week’s dip toward $100,000 levels, which had been triggered by market-wide volatility and profit-taking. While BTC remains approximately 4.2% below its all-time high of $111,000 reached last month, the weekly trend still reflects a 3.3% increase, suggesting buyers are gradually regaining confidence. This market behavior is mirrored in a set of on-chain indicators recently analyzed by CryptoQuant contributor Amr Taha. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Ethereum Defend Key Moving Averages – Bullish Signal Or Temporary Relief? Bitcoin On-Chain Metrics Reflect Accumulation Behavior In Taha’s analysis titled “On-Chain Data Hints at Bitcoin’s Next Leg Higher,” Taha examined several metrics that point to a potential continuation of the rally. These include the Binance Taker Buy/Sell Ratio, UTXO age bands, and the Long-Term Holder (LTH) realized cap. All three suggest that market participants are actively accumulating and that underlying sentiment is shifting toward renewed bullishness. One of the primary indicators Taha focused on is Binance’s Taker Buy/Sell Ratio, which has recently climbed to 1.1. This metric evaluates the volume of aggressive market buys versus market sells on the Binance exchange. A ratio above 1 typically implies that more participants are willing to pay the market price to buy than to sell, indicating stronger buyer conviction. According to Taha, such shifts historically precede continued price increases when supported by volume. Another key metric showing strength is the Buy/Sell Pressure Delta over the last 90 days. This indicator tracks the net difference between buying and selling pressure and is now halfway to its historical peak at 0.02. Taha explains that this suggests a market not yet overheated, with room for further accumulation. Combined with recent breakout behavior above the 1D–1W UTXO band, representing recently transacted coins, this hints that many new holders are currently in profit and choosing to hold rather than sell. LTH Conviction and Stablecoin Inflows Reinforce Bullish Case Taha also noted the Long-Term Holder (LTH) Realized Cap has now surpassed $56 billion, reflecting strong hands holding a larger share of Bitcoin supply. These coins have not moved in over 155 days and are considered to represent investors with higher conviction. The increase in this metric implies that fewer coins are being sold into the market, a signal that many investors are expecting higher valuations in the coming weeks or months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Leveraged Traders Are Back Betting On A Price Decline — What This Means In addition, more than $550 million in stablecoins have reportedly flowed into Binance in recent hours. Historically, such inflows to spot exchanges, as opposed to derivatives platforms, often suggest readiness to deploy capital for direct asset purchases. Notably, all of these indicators can be seen as a leading signal of potential volatility or buying pressure. If this pattern holds, Bitcoin’s short-term price activity may benefit from continued accumulation and institutional positioning.

2025-06-10T03:19:03,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: BTC Holds $109.7K as Bulls Watch $111.8K","Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $109,690, up 3.81% in the last 24 hours, as traders weigh global macro risks and technical momentum. This week’s Bitcoin price prediction leans bullish, following a sharp recovery from the previous week’s dip below $100,400, triggered by the Trump-Musk spat, and a strong bounce fueled by U.S. jobs data and renewed risk appetite. Investors are now watching U.S.–China trade talks in London, a key geopolitical event that may impact risk markets. So far, Bitcoin has remained resilient above $109,000, signaling investor confidence. What’s keeping Bitcoin steady? Apart from macro support, institutional participation is growing fast: Over 80 publicly traded companies (e.g., MicroStrategy, GameStop) now hold BTC The U.S. government owns nearly 200,000 BTC, according to blockchain data Gemini’s IPO filing points to sustained investor interest in crypto firms Together, these factors add legitimacy and long-term demand strength, bolstering bullish Bitcoin price predictions. Bitcoin Faces Key Resistance at $111.8K On the technical side, the Bitcoin price prediction remains bullish as BTC approaches the upper trendline of its ascending channel, testing resistance near $111,848. A breakout here would confirm the bullish continuation setup and target higher resistance levels at $115,103 and $118,358. The daily RSI is holding at 61, signaling positive momentum but leaving room before overbought conditions emerge. Also worth noting: the June 7 bullish engulfing candle, which often marks a return to trend after a retracement. Bitcoin price prediction: short-term trade idea Entry: Confirmed daily close above $111,848 Stop-loss: Below $107,616 Target 1: $115,103 Target 2: $118,358 Watch for: RSI divergence or rejection at $111.8K This bullish setup remains valid as long as BTC stays above the lower channel trendline near $107,000. Crackdowns and M&A Signal Maturing Market Beyond price, structural developments are helping shape Bitcoin’s evolving reputation. In Australia, authorities have just charged four money laundering rings involving $123 million in cryptocurrency, showing that even illicit crypto activity can be traced, which boosts trust in blockchain transparency. $NCPL buys Mixie, a blockchain-native platform building infrastructure and tools for Web3 games, creator media, and decentralized community engagement. pic.twitter.com/gRzkZzSyi2 — Joey Rattlesnake (@tallahassee_m) June 9, 2025 Meanwhile, Netcapital (NCPL) acquired the crypto-native platform Mixie, marking a significant step in crypto mergers and acquisitions (M&A). The fintech firm said the deal enhances its Web3 capabilities, reflecting broader institutional interest. This follows a 2025 trend of consolidation led by players like Coinbase and Ripple. These headlines support the broader Bitcoin price prediction narrative: strong demand, growing corporate adoption, and tightening legal clarity are laying the groundwork for Bitcoin’s next leg up.

2025-06-10T02:16:03,"Why is The Crypto Market Going Up Today?","The post Why is The Crypto Market Going Up Today? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market is back in action today, with a sharp rally across major coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. At the time of writing, the total crypto market capitalization has jumped to $3.43 trillion, showing a healthy 4.22% rise in the past 24 hours. Investor sentiment has also turned positive. The Fear & Greed Index now reads 64, firmly in ‘Greed’ territory — a clear sign that traders are feeling confident about the market’s direction. So, what’s fueling this rally? Let’s break it down. Bitcoin Leads the Charge The star of the show is Bitcoin, which finally broke out of a consolidation range it had been stuck in since May 23rd. Currently trading above $109,500, Bitcoin’s breakout is being closely watched by analysts. This move was expected because of a bullish weekly candle formation called a three-inside-up pattern around the $100,000 mark. Historically, this kind of setup often leads to an 8-10% pump within a week or two. If momentum continues, some analysts believe Bitcoin could soon touch $115,000 — or even higher. Global Factors Also at Play Apart from technical signals, positive news on the macro front is also helping the rally. Reports show that trade talks between the United States and China have resumed, easing global market tensions. This, combined with growing institutional interest, has boosted investor confidence. Altcoins Follow Suit Following Bitcoin’s lead, altcoins are also climbing. Ethereum is up over 8% this week, now trading at $2,699, while Solana and Dogecoin have surged 5% and 6.6% respectively. Interestingly, Sui (SUI) and Hyperliquid (HYPE) have posted impressive double-digit gains. The Altcoin Season Index, however, remains at 30 out of 100, meaning that while altcoins are rallying, a full-fledged alt season hasn’t arrived yet.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-is-the-crypto-market-going-up-today/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis",cryptocompare

Grant Funding Aimed At Growth Based on a post on X, the XRPL Japan and Korea Fund will pick early-stage teams in Japan that work on DeFi, tokenized real assets and digital payments. Winners will get as much as $200,000 per project. There’s clear focus on projects that show promise through strong tech and plans to scale. Ripple says funding decisions will hinge on growth potential and how well each team aligns with its goals. Ripple and @Web3Salon , supported by JETRO, are launching a new partnership for Japan-based Web3 startups: https://t.co/TfcOf62srY Open to early-stage teams building on the XRP Ledger with a focus on DeFi, tokenization, and payments. Learn how this program will fuel the next… — RippleX (@RippleXDev) June 9, 2025 Mentorship And Workshops For Founders According to the Web3 Salon project, founders won’t just get money. They’ll also join hands-on workshops and one-on-one coaching. Mentors include seasoned entrepreneurs and policy experts. That means help with business plans. It means guidance on dealing with Japan’s rules. It also offers chances to sit at roundtables with regulators and potential backers. Community Events Line Up Through 2026 Ripple and Web3 Salon will co-host four big events between now and March 2026. Each gathering will put the spotlight on standout teams. There’ll be pitch sessions. There’ll be panels with voices from both inside Japan and abroad. Investor meet-ups will give startups a chance to find more funding. And workshops will cover token rules and cross-border work. Regulatory Support From JETRO Japan External Trade Organization, or JETRO, is on board to smooth the path. Reports say JETRO will help connect fintech startups with government bodies. That’s key in Japan’s tightly regulated market. According to JETRO, this move aims to make it easier for new blockchain ideas to pass compliance checks and move forward without getting stuck in red tape. Bringing Global Partners Together Beyond cash and coaching, Ripple will open its global network to these startups. Based on statements from Christina Chan, Senior Director of Developer Growth at RippleX, teams will get access to Ripple’s customers and experts. That can speed up testing in foreign markets. It can also spark cross-border payment pilots or token launches with big names. Why Japan Is In The Spotlight Japan is known for strong rules and top technical talent. But its strict setup can slow innovation. According to Asia Web3 Alliance Japan President Hinza Asif, this tie-up aims to cut through complexity. It’s about giving founders the tools they need. It’s also about making sure blockchain projects fit local rules and global standards.

The latest filings show $62.7 million in STRK and $43.3 million in STRF went into Bitcoin purchases. No new common shares were registered this round. That keeps Strategy at about 0.02 BTC per MSTR share—10 times more Bitcoin per share than any other name in the sector. Strategy's latest Bitcoin purchase filing with the SEC. Impact On Market Supply Corporate treasuries now hold roughly 3.4 million BTC. That stash includes what miners and governments no longer sell. It leaves less coin on the open market. Over-the-counter desks have seen their inventories drop from 236,000 BTC a month ago to just 123,500 BTC today. Even Coinbase Prime, one of the main outlets for big players, shows only 63,535 BTC available. Corporate Trends And Outlook Strategy’s moves still cast a long shadow. Only 26 other public companies have more than 1,000 BTC, and just seven hold over 10,000 BTC. On-chain data points to nearly 2,000 whale wallets that top those numbers. In the past week alone, five additional firms bought BTC, using their purchases to grab attention on social media. In all, 124 public companies have now listed Bitcoin on their balance sheets or signaled plans to buy.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Bitcoin is trading below $110,000, changing hands at $109.7K , as Asia continues its trading week. The move challenges a prevailing market narrative of summer stagnation, coming on the heels of a note from QCP Capital that emphasized suppressed volatility and a lack of immediate catalysts. A recent Telegram note from QCP pointed to one-year lows in implied volatility and a pattern of subdued price action, noting that BTC had been “stuck in a tight range” as summer approaches. A clean break below $100K or above $110K, they wrote, would be needed to “reawaken broader market interest.” Even so, QCP warned that recent macro developments had failed to spark directional conviction. “Even as US equities rallied and gold sold off in the wake of Friday’s stronger-than-expected jobs report, BTC remained conspicuously unmoved, caught in the cross-currents without a clear macro anchor,” the note said. “Without a compelling narrative to spark the next leg higher, signs of fatigue are emerging. Perpetual open interest is softening, and spot BTC ETF inflows have started to taper.” That context makes the current move all the more surprising. Over the weekend, Bitcoin surged 3.26% from $105,393 to $108,801, with hourly volume spiking to 2.5x the 24-hour average, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. BTC broke decisively above $106,500, establishing new support at $107,600, and continued upward into Monday’s session, reaching $110,169. The breakout coincides with a tense macro backdrop: US-China trade talks in London and a $22 billion U.S. Treasury bond auction later this week have injected uncertainty into global markets. While these events could drive fresh volatility, QCP cautioned that recent headlines have mostly led to “knee-jerk reactions” that quickly fade. The question now is whether BTC’s move above $110K has true staying power, or whether the rally is running ahead of the fundamentals. A 'Massive Shift' in Institutional Staking May Drive ETH's Next Rally Ethereum’s critics have long highlighted centralization risks, but that narrative is fading as institutional adoption accelerates, infrastructure matures, and recent protocol upgrades directly address past limitations. “Market participants will pay for decentralization because it's in their economic interest from a security and principal protection standpoint,” Mara Schmiedt, CEO of institutional Ethereum staking platform Alluvial, told CoinDesk. “If you look at [decentralization metrics] all of these things have massively improved over the last couple of years."" There's currently $492 million worth of ETH staked by Liquid Collective – a protocol co-founded by Alluvial to facilitate institutional staking While this figure may appear modest compared to Ethereum’s total staked volume of around $93 billion, what's interesting is that it originates predominantly from institutional investors. ""We’re really on the cusp of a truly massive shift for Ethereum, driven by regulatory momentum and the ability to unlock the advantages of secure staking,"" she noted. Central to Ethereum’s institutional readiness is the recent Pectra upgrade, a significant development Schmiedt describes as both ""massive"" and ""underappreciated."" ""I think Pectra has been a massive upgrade. I actually think it’s been underappreciated, just in terms of the tremendous amount of change it introduces into the staking mechanics,"" Schmiedt said. Additionally, Execution Layer triggerable withdrawals—a key component of Pectra—provide institutional participants, including ETF issuers, a crucial compatibility upgrade. This feature enables partial validator exits directly from Ethereum’s execution layer, aligning with institutional operational requirements such as T+1 redemption timelines. ""EL triggerable withdrawals create a much more effective path to exit for large-scale market participants,"" Schmiedt added. Ultimately, Schmiedt said, ""I think we'll see that a lot more [ETH] in institutional portfolios going forward.” News Roundup Trump Media May Be the Cheapest Bitcoin Play Among Public Stocks, NYDIG Says Trump Media (DJT) may be one of the cheapest ways to get bitcoin exposure in public markets, according to a new report from NYDIG, CoinDesk recently reported. As a growing number of companies adopt MicroStrategy’s strategy of stacking BTC on their balance sheets, analysts are rethinking how to value these so-called bitcoin treasury firms. While the commonly used modified net asset value (mNAV) metric suggests that investors are paying a premium for BTC exposure, NYDIG’s Greg Cipolaro argues mNAV alone is “woefully deficient.” Instead, he points to the equity premium to NAV, which factors in debt, cash, and enterprise value, as a more accurate gauge. By that measure, Trump Media and Semler Scientific (SMLR) rank as the most undervalued of eight companies analyzed, trading at equity premiums of -16% and -10% respectively, despite both showing mNAVs above 1.1. In other words, their shares are worth less than the value of the bitcoin they hold. That’s in stark contrast to MicroStrategy (MSTR), which rose nearly 5% Monday as bitcoin crossed $110,000, while DJT and SMLR remained mostly flat—making them potentially overlooked vehicles for BTC exposure. Circle Stock Nearly Quadruples Post-IPO as Bitwise and ProShares File Competing ETFs Two major ETF issuers, Bitwise and ProShares, filed proposals on June 6 to launch exchange-traded funds tied to Circle (CRCL), whose stock has nearly quadrupled since its IPO late last week, CoinDesk previously reported. ProShares is aiming for a leveraged product that delivers 2x the daily performance of CRCL. At the same time, Bitwise plans a covered call fund that generates income by selling options against held shares, two very different ways to capitalize on the stock’s explosive rise. CRCL surged another 9% Monday in volatile trading, continuing to draw interest from both traditional finance and crypto investors. The proposed ETFs have an effective date of August 20, pending SEC approval. If approved, they would further blur the lines between crypto and conventional finance, giving investors new tools to play one of the hottest post-IPO names of the year. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin is trading at $109,795 after a 3.26% breakout fueled by institutional buying, elevated volume, and macro uncertainty from US-China trade talks and an upcoming $22B Treasury auction. ETH: Ethereum rebounded 4.46% from a low of $2,480 to close at $2,581, with strong buying volume confirming support at $2,580 and setting up a potential breakout above $2,590. Gold: Gold is trading at $3,314.45, edging up 0.08% as investors watch US-China trade talks in London and a subdued dollar keeps prices attractive. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets rose Tuesday, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 up 0.51%, as investors awaited updates from ongoing U.S.-China trade talks. S&P 500: The S&P 500 closed slightly higher Monday, boosted by Amazon and Alphabet, as investors monitored U.S.-China trade talks.

2025-06-10T01:00:35,"Bitcoin & Ethereum Diverge—ETF Flows Just Flipped The Narrative","Data shows the demand for spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has cooled off for Bitcoin, while Ethereum has continued to attract inflows. Bitcoin Has Ended A Streak Of Positive ETF Flows In a new thread on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the total balance of the US spot ETFs has changed for Bitcoin and Ethereum recently. The spot ETFs refer to investment vehicles that provide an alternate means of gaining exposure to a cryptocurrency’s price movements in a manner that’s familiar to traditional investors. Related Reading: Crypto Suffers $1 Billion Flush As Musk-Trump Feud Shakes Bitcoin These ETFs are a relatively new presence in the sector, but they have gained sufficient popularity to become a key part of the market. Investors who previously avoided digital assets due to the perceived complexity of wallets and exchanges can now invest through ETFs, which trade on traditional exchanges. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the spot ETFs for Bitcoin back in January 2024. They got approval for Ethereum half a year later, in July 2024. First, here is how the balance held by the spot ETFs has changed for Ethereum since their inauguration: As displayed in the above graph, the total balance of the Ethereum spot ETFs has been on the rise recently. In fact, the cryptocurrency has now seen four straight weeks of net inflows. In all, 97,800 ETH have entered into the wallets associated with these ETFs during this green netflow streak. Though despite the continuous inflows, their total holdings are yet to hit the 3.81 million ETH peak from February, as they currently sit at 3.77 million ETH, about 41,000 tokens lower. “Accumulation is steady, but room remains for further upside,” notes Glassnode. Bitcoin has also seen growth in its spot ETF holdings recently, but unlike Ethereum, the number one digital asset saw the metric surpass its high from February last month. That said, while the Bitcoin spot ETFs were enjoying inflows until very recently, the trend has changed during the past week as net outflows have occurred instead. This has been the first negative week in eight for the BTC ETFs. “Total holdings are now 1.20M BTC, down ~11.5K BTC from the late-May peak,” explains the analytics firm. “A pause in demand after a strong run-up – watch for signs of re-acceleration.” Related Reading: Bitcoin RSI Dips Below 30—Is A New All-Time High Next?

The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $323 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of around $19 billion, rebounded from the lower border of a consolidation level of around $2,480. As a result, the ETH price has been retesting a crucial local resistance level around $2,681, whereby the Ether price was rejected four times in the past four weeks. Major Reasons Ethereum Price Will Rally Higher This Week Strong Institutional Adoption and ETF Flows According to market data analysis from CoinShares, Ethereum’s investment product dominated last week’s cash inflow with about $296 million. Notably, Ether’s investment product outpaced Bitcoin’s, which recorded a net cash outflow of about $56.5 million last week. As Coinpedia had reported , BlackRock’s ETHA has recorded significant cash inflows in the past two weeks, suggesting a strong demand from institutional clients. Altseason Sentiment Ethereum price is well positioned to rally towards a new local high this week fueled by the rising narrative of altseason 2025. With Bitcoin dominance signaling an imminent market reversal, more crypto investors are betting on a major altcoin rally in the near future. Furthermore, the ETH/BTC pair is heavily oversold in the weekly timeframe, amid the recent market reversal. Regulatory Clarity Earlier on Monday, the U.S. Chair Paul Atkins highlighted that American crypto investors have the right to self-custody of crypto assets. Additionally, Chair Atkins highlighted that a new and clear set of DeFi regulations are needed to foster the development of the nascent blockchain technology. With Ethereum harboring the largest DeFi space, with a total value locked (TVL) of about $63 billion and a stablecoins market cap of around $124 billion, the altcoin is well positioned to rally further in the near future.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/top-reasons-why-ethereum-eth-price-will-reach-2800-this-week/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Ethereum",cryptocompare

2025-06-10T00:20:08,"Crypto IPO boom and trade talks fuel Bitcoin’s climb","Bitcoin soared above the $110,000 mark late Monday for the first time in nearly two weeks, buoyed by optimism surrounding renewed trade discussions between the United States and China. The price jump also triggered a wave of short liquidations as the rally gained momentum. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization recently traded at around $110,286 , marking a 3.6% gain over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin is now up nearly 5% over the last seven days, rebounding from a dip below $101,000 on June 5—a pullback that capped a broader decline dating back to late May. With BTC now nearing its all-time high of $111,814 set in May, market watchers are taking note. “Bitcoin breaking above $110,000 for the first time in two weeks signals renewed bullish momentum after a period of consolidation,” said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto investment firm BitBull Capital. “If BTC can hold this level, it may set the stage for a fresh push toward the $120,000 range.” Other major altcoins also rose. Ethereum (ETH), the second cryptocurrency by market cap, gained 4.5% to more than $2,679, and Solana (SOL) added more than 3% to hover close to $160. Even meme coins, which have struggled in recent weeks, showed signs of recovery. Dogecoin jumped 4.5%, and Shiba Inu added 2.5%. Crypto IPO boom and trade talks fuel Bitcoin’s climb The market’s uplift coincides with renewed talks between Washington and Beijing over longstanding trade tariffs—discussions that have soothed broader investor nerves. Investors seem optimistic about the potential for resolving trade disputes between the US and one of its largest trading partners. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and China’s vice premier for economic policy, He Lifeng, will lead their respective delegations in negotiations expected to continue on Tuesday. Equities responded modestly, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 edging slightly on the day. Another factor contributing to Bitcoin’s price surge is increased crypto-related IPOs . Last week, stablecoin giant Circle went public on the New York Stock Exchange and saw its shares pop over 168%, jumping from $31 to $69 within the first day of trading. Gemini, a crypto exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins, also filed for an IPO According to David Siemer, CEO of crypto asset management company Wave Digital Assets, while the IPO bump is likely short-term excitement, the long-term institutional positioning leads us to be bullish about Bitcoin’s continued performance in 2025. Bitcoin shorts crushed as $323M liquidated in a day In the past 24 hours, close to $323 million of crypto short positions have been liquidated, CoinGlass data shows. Most of the damage was in Bitcoin, which saw around $196 million worth of liquidations. The liquidations come amid mounting macroeconomic pressures and renewed trade tensions, which have rattled investor confidence. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen outflows in five of the last seven trading sessions, reflecting the cautious sentiment. In contrast, Ethereum ETFs have enjoyed a streak of positive momentum, notching 15 consecutive days of inflows. 10X Research wrote in a report released Monday morning that Bitcoin is testing a breakout level, and the market setup appears significantly different from what most investors anticipated just weeks ago. According to the report, negative funding rates, a pattern of market bottoms, and a surprising surge in spot demand combine to create a high-conviction signal.

The pseudonymous analyst tells his 548,000 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin is attempting to move into a “price discovery uptrend.” Price discovery often refers to a process when the price of an asset moves to uncharted territory, forcing buyers and sellers to seek agreement on value. Says Rekt Capital, “Bitcoin Price Discovery Roadmap: Bitcoin is currently in a transitional phase. Price is trying to successfully post-breakout retest its ReAccumulation Range to transition into Price Discovery Uptrend 2. A volatile retest/deviation here could occur.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Rekt Capital says that BTC closing above $104,400 on the week could be the key signal that it has successfully retested the demand zone and is gearing up for higher prices. “The retest continues to be successful. Can Bitcoin successfully confirm this retest with a Weekly Close above $104400 for what would be a 4th week in a row?” Zooming in on the daily chart, the trader says that BTC needs to close above its immediate resistance and flip it into support to fully confirm a bullish continuation of the trend. “On the Daily timeframe, Bitcoin is showcasing signs of breaking its two-week Downtrend (light blue) while also turning it into support… Daily Closing & retesting ~$106,600 (black) would be even better to enable trend continuation.” Source: Rekt Capital/X At time of writing, BTC is trading at $105,528.

Despite this, the pace of investments appears to be slowing, as investors grow cautious and await clearer guidance from the US Federal Reserve regarding inflation and the broader direction of monetary policy. According to the latest edition of CoinShares’ Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report, Bitcoin recorded $56.5 million in outflows for a second week, reflecting investor caution amid policy uncertainty. Short-Bitcoin products similarly saw $4.1 million in outflows, which represented their second consecutive week of declining interest. Ethereum continued to lead digital asset investments this week with $296.4 million in inflows, marking its seventh consecutive positive week and totaling $1.5 billion, which is equivalent to 10.5% of total assets under management. This is the strongest streak of inflows since the US election in November, which indicated growing optimism among investors. On the other hand, multi-asset investment products recorded $6.6 million in outflows for the third week running. Altcoins remained mostly flat during the same period, with the exception of Sui and Chainlink, which brought in modest inflows of $1.1 million and $0.2 million. Meanwhile, XRP faced outflows of $4 million, while Solana and Cardano saw $2.1 million and $0.4 million in outflows, respectively. The United States topped weekly inflows with $175 million over the past week, while Germany followed with $47.8 million. Switzerland, Canada, and Australia contributed $15.7 million, $9.8 million, and $6.5 million, respectively. Meanwhile, Brazil recorded $9.2 million in outflows.

BTC formed an ascending channel pattern, suggesting bullish continuation with a 46% upside potential. The 50-week EMA at $85,136 acts as dynamic support, maintaining the long-term bullish structure. Bitcoin’s volatility has dropped to its lowest level in nearly a decade, a sign of a major structural shift in the market’s behavior. According to new data visualized by Ecoinometrics, Bitcoin’s 30-day realized volatility sits near the 10th percentile, meaning current market fluctuations are calmer than 90% of all weekly periods since 2015, suggesting Bitcoin is maturing into a more stable asset even as it continues its strong upward trend. This dramatic decline in volatility, which comes despite a sharp rally in May and the asset reaching new all-time highs, marks a significant change in Bitcoin’s risk profile and could make it far more attractive to a new class of institutional investors.

Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Below $2,800 – Bulls Need This Level To Trigger Next Leg Up Since the start of the year, Ethereum has faced steep declines and inconsistent follow-through on bullish setups. However, many believe ETH is now positioned to recover lost ground — if bulls can reclaim the $2,800 resistance and flip it into support. A breakout above that level would likely open the door for a broader altcoin rally. Top analyst Big Cheds weighed in on the current structure, noting that Ethereum’s weekly chart printed its fourth small-bodied candle in a row — a classic sign of indecision. According to Cheds, ETH “still looks pre-tower top,” suggesting a potential trend shift may be forming. Ethereum Holds Ground As Bulls Face Critical Resistance Ethereum has managed to hold strong above key support levels despite several weeks of market-wide pullback and volatility. Trading above the $2,400–$2,500 zone, ETH has shown resilience while many altcoins have lost momentum. This range has become a critical battleground, with bulls now needing a clean breakout above the $2,800 mark to confirm a return to a bullish phase and potentially kick off the next leg higher. But while the technical structure remains intact for now, macroeconomic headwinds are building. US Treasury yields continue to rise as markets brace for prolonged high interest rates, signaling tighter financial conditions ahead. Combined with ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and sluggish global growth expectations, these factors continue to weigh heavily on risk assets, including crypto. Adding to the cautious tone, top analyst Big Cheds recently highlighted Ethereum’s weakening weekly momentum. According to Cheds, ETH is heading for its fourth consecutive small-bodied weekly candle — a signal of indecision that typically precedes major moves. He notes that the current setup looks pre-tower top, a classic bearish formation that often marks exhaustion at the top of a trend before a sharp reversal. This puts Ethereum at a critical juncture. A decisive breakout above $2,800 would invalidate the bearish scenario and strengthen the case for recovery toward the $3,000–$3,200 range. On the other hand, continued weakness and a failure to gain traction could trigger renewed selling pressure, especially if macro conditions worsen. As Ethereum trades within a tightening range, the next few weeks will be crucial. Whether bulls can flip resistance or bears regain control will likely determine the direction for ETH and the broader altcoin market heading into Q3.

ETH Reclaims Short-Term Support But Faces Overhead Pressure Ethereum is trading at $2,539 on the 4-hour chart, showing a modest rebound of +1.86% on the day. After briefly dipping below its 200 SMA ($2,511), ETH has reclaimed this key level and is now pushing toward the cluster of shorter-term moving averages — including the 34 EMA ($2,528), 50 SMA ($2,543), and 100 SMA ($2,565). This area represents immediate resistance, and how ETH reacts here will likely determine the next short-term trend. Since early May, ETH has been trading in a wide consolidation range between $2,400 and $2,800. The recent price action suggests ongoing indecision, with lower highs forming and strong support holding near the 200 SMA. Volume remains relatively muted, indicating a lack of strong directional conviction. Related Reading: Solana Key Indicator Flashes Buy Signal On Daily Chart – Rally Ahead? For bulls, reclaiming and holding above the 100 SMA is crucial for breaking out of the current range and targeting the $2,700–$2,800 region. On the downside, a loss of the 200 SMA could lead to a swift retest of $2,430 and potentially deeper downside.

The flagship coin rallied over 4 percent in the last 24 hours to reach a local high of about $110,260, less than 2 percent from its all-time high, on Monday, June 9 during the late North American session. The wider altcoin market, led by Ethereum (ETH), followed in tandem. As a result, the total crypto Open Interest (OI) surged over 6 percent to hover about $154.8 billion at the time of this writing. Additionally, more than $403 million was liquidated from the crypto-leveraged market, led by Bitcoin’s $197 million. Major Factors Influencing the Bitcoin Rally Today Favorable Regulatory Environment As Coinpedia reported , the Chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Paul Atkins, has reiterated the importance of self-custody of crypto assets and clear regulatory frameworks for DeFi protocols. The favoring regulatory frameworks in the United States will have a ripple effect in other countries, thus enabling further crypto adoption by institutional investors. High Demand from Institutional Investors The overall supply of Bitcoin on centralized exchanges has continued to exponentially decline in the past few years, catalyzed by the high demand from institutional investors. Strategy Inc . has led dozens of companies in implementing a Bitcoin treasury management plan. The U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have continued to relentlessly accumulate, thus recording the fastest ETF growth to $70 billion in modern history. Macroeconomic Outlook BTC price has continued to grow in the recent past in tandem with the rising global liquidity. In addition to favoring technical aspects, whereby BTC’s daily timeframe recorded a golden cross between the 50 and 200 MA, the flagship coin has recorded impressive gains fueled by the short term uncertainty in the U.S. economy that is struggling with a historical debt crisis.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/top-reasons-why-bitcoin-btc-price-rebounded-above-110k-today/,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|REGULATION|TRADING","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-06-09T22:10:35,"Paraguayan President’s X Account Hacked – False Bitcoin Legal Tender Announcement Posted","Key Takeaways: Paraguay’s President Santiago Peña had his official X account compromised, leading to the spread of a false announcement about Bitcoin. The language and content of the post raised immediate red flags among observers, prompting swift clarification from the Paraguayan government. On-chain analysis showed the attached wallet had minimal funds and no activity, suggesting a phishing attempt. Paraguay’s President, Santiago Peña, became the latest high-profile figure to fall victim to a social media hack after his official X account was compromised on Monday. The breach resulted in a fake announcement claiming the country had adopted Bitcoin as legal tender. Paraguay Denies Bitcoin Legal Tender Claim After Presidential Account Hack The message, written unusually in English rather than Spanish, declared that Paraguay had made Bitcoin an official currency. It also claimed the government had created a $5 million BTC reserve and launched a bond program for “crypto-enabled citizens.” The post urged users to send any amount of Bitcoin to a wallet address, supposedly to determine the scale of a national rollout. https://twitter.com/SantiPenap/status/1932125390153396541 Observers quickly flagged the message as suspicious. Many noted that the language and tone were inconsistent with previous communications from the president, who typically posts in Spanish. Shortly after the post went live, the platform flagged the account for “irregular activity,” according to an additional report. The Paraguayan government swiftly issued an official response. The presidential account posted a message in Spanish that read: “Información falsa. Comunicado oficial de la presidencia de la República del Paraguay.” This statement confirmed that the Bitcoin announcement was false. Comunicado oficial. pic.twitter.com/Bk3XI6ohpp — Presidencia Paraguay (@PresidenciaPy) June 9, 2025 However, the hacker attempted to conceal the government’s warning by hiding the official reply beneath the scam post. The fraudulent message remained live for a time, possibly misleading unsuspecting users. On-chain data revealed that the wallet address provided by the hacker held only $4 and had recorded no transactions since the announcement. Despite the low activity, the nature of the post resembled a classic crypto phishing scheme. Authorities urged the public not to trust any posts from the president’s account until further notice. Paraguay’s national cybersecurity team has launched an investigation and is working with X to resolve the incident and restore control over the account. “We ask citizens to ignore any messages from the presidential account until we confirm its security,” the government said. Ongoing Crypto Scam Wave Hits Political and Industry Targets Across Latin America The hacking of Paraguayan President Santiago Peña’s official X account adds to a growing string of high-profile social media compromises, many of which have targeted the crypto industry and public figures to spread misinformation and scams. Over the past year, threat actors have increasingly exploited X for crypto-related phishing attacks. In May 2025 alone, the X accounts of Ethereum Layer-2 project ZKsync and its developer Matter Labs, were breached . @zksync & @the_matter_labs official X accounts hacked to post fake SEC alerts & phishing airdrops—ZK token drops 5%. #zksync #sec #phishing https://t.co/j4Yx6HHaob — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 13, 2025 Hackers posted fraudulent messages claiming the protocol was under U.S. investigation and shared phishing links disguised as airdrops. Around the same time, the New York Post’s account was hijacked to impersonate journalists and lure crypto users into fake podcast offers via Telegram. Earlier in the year, Canadian regulators also flagged fake articles featuring political endorsements used to promote crypto scams. State-sponsored hackers from the Lazarus Group have also posed as VCs in fake Zoom meetings to steal users’ private keys.” Paraguay has shown no intention to follow El Salvador’s 2021 move, which remains in a legal gray area following an IMF agreement reached in late 2024. Meanwhile, Paraguay’s crypto scene is under pressure. As Bitcoin mining gains traction, thanks to the country’s hydroelectric surplus, regulatory tensions are rising. Industrial players warn that new electricity rates could drive miners away . With over 10,000 illicit mining rigs seized in 2024 and tensions rising around mining regulations, the misuse of official platforms for misinformation poses a real threat to public understanding in an already volatile sector.

Terrett tells her 238,200 followers on the social media platform X that the statement is “imminent.” “NEW: I’m hearing that a joint statement is imminent from the eight leading crypto trade associations, along with Uniswap and Jump, expressing their support for the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act (BRCA) being included in the latest version of the CLARITY Act.” The BRCA aims to provide clarity and certainty for developers, miners, and other innovators in the non-custodial crypto ecosystem. According to Terrett, the eight groups are the DeFi Education Fund, Coin Center, Solana Institute, Chamber of Digital Commerce, Blockchain Association, Crypto Council, Bitcoin Policy Institute and Paradigm, who say that the legislation is critical for protecting software developers and infrastructure providers who do not custody customer funds. “The amendment, originally introduced by GOP Majority Whip and now with bipartisan support from Rep Ritchie, is being viewed by many in the industry as a foundational policy safeguard for DeFi developers. ‘It’s critically important that we don’t treat open-source developers like traditional financial institutions,’ one policy lead told me. ‘The BRCA draws that line clearly and protects innovation.’ The joint statement urges lawmakers to include the BRCA in the CLARITY Act, the House’s digital asset market structure bill, which is expected to be marked up next week.” At time of writing, no statement has been issued.
