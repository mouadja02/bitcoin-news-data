2025-06-09T23:45:04,"Digital Asset Funds Add $224M, But Investment Momentum Slow","Digital asset investment products attracted $224 million in inflows last week, pushing the 7-week total to $11 billion. Despite this, the pace of investments appears to be slowing, as investors grow cautious and await clearer guidance from the US Federal Reserve regarding inflation and the broader direction of monetary policy. According to the latest edition of CoinShares’ Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report, Bitcoin recorded $56.5 million in outflows for a second week, reflecting investor caution amid policy uncertainty. Short-Bitcoin products similarly saw $4.1 million in outflows, which represented their second consecutive week of declining interest. Ethereum continued to lead digital asset investments this week with $296.4 million in inflows, marking its seventh consecutive positive week and totaling $1.5 billion, which is equivalent to 10.5% of total assets under management. This is the strongest streak of inflows since the US election in November, which indicated growing optimism among investors. On the other hand, multi-asset investment products recorded $6.6 million in outflows for the third week running. Altcoins remained mostly flat during the same period, with the exception of Sui and Chainlink, which brought in modest inflows of $1.1 million and $0.2 million. Meanwhile, XRP faced outflows of $4 million, while Solana and Cardano saw $2.1 million and $0.4 million in outflows, respectively. The United States topped weekly inflows with $175 million over the past week, while Germany followed with $47.8 million. Switzerland, Canada, and Australia contributed $15.7 million, $9.8 million, and $6.5 million, respectively. Meanwhile, Brazil recorded $9.2 million in outflows. Hong Kong saw $14.6 million withdrawn, ending its recent inflow surge. Sweden also reported weekly outflows totaling $7.7 million.

2025-06-09T23:30:46,"Ethereum Weekly Structure Tightens – Tower Top Pattern In Play?","Ethereum has pulled back roughly 14% since the last week of May, but it’s holding firm above the critical $2,400 support zone. Despite recent volatility across the crypto market, ETH’s ability to defend this level has kept hopes alive for a potential recovery. Analysts are closely watching Ethereum’s next move, as the asset still trades well below its yearly highs, offering room for upside if momentum returns. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Below $2,800 – Bulls Need This Level To Trigger Next Leg Up Since the start of the year, Ethereum has faced steep declines and inconsistent follow-through on bullish setups. However, many believe ETH is now positioned to recover lost ground — if bulls can reclaim the $2,800 resistance and flip it into support. A breakout above that level would likely open the door for a broader altcoin rally. Top analyst Big Cheds weighed in on the current structure, noting that Ethereum’s weekly chart printed its fourth small-bodied candle in a row — a classic sign of indecision. According to Cheds, ETH “still looks pre-tower top,” suggesting a potential trend shift may be forming. Ethereum Holds Ground As Bulls Face Critical Resistance Ethereum has managed to hold strong above key support levels despite several weeks of market-wide pullback and volatility. Trading above the $2,400–$2,500 zone, ETH has shown resilience while many altcoins have lost momentum. This range has become a critical battleground, with bulls now needing a clean breakout above the $2,800 mark to confirm a return to a bullish phase and potentially kick off the next leg higher. But while the technical structure remains intact for now, macroeconomic headwinds are building. US Treasury yields continue to rise as markets brace for prolonged high interest rates, signaling tighter financial conditions ahead. Combined with ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and sluggish global growth expectations, these factors continue to weigh heavily on risk assets, including crypto. Adding to the cautious tone, top analyst Big Cheds recently highlighted Ethereum’s weakening weekly momentum. According to Cheds, ETH is heading for its fourth consecutive small-bodied weekly candle — a signal of indecision that typically precedes major moves. He notes that the current setup looks pre-tower top, a classic bearish formation that often marks exhaustion at the top of a trend before a sharp reversal. This puts Ethereum at a critical juncture. A decisive breakout above $2,800 would invalidate the bearish scenario and strengthen the case for recovery toward the $3,000–$3,200 range. On the other hand, continued weakness and a failure to gain traction could trigger renewed selling pressure, especially if macro conditions worsen. As Ethereum trades within a tightening range, the next few weeks will be crucial. Whether bulls can flip resistance or bears regain control will likely determine the direction for ETH and the broader altcoin market heading into Q3.

ETH Reclaims Short-Term Support But Faces Overhead Pressure Ethereum is trading at $2,539 on the 4-hour chart, showing a modest rebound of +1.86% on the day. After briefly dipping below its 200 SMA ($2,511), ETH has reclaimed this key level and is now pushing toward the cluster of shorter-term moving averages — including the 34 EMA ($2,528), 50 SMA ($2,543), and 100 SMA ($2,565). This area represents immediate resistance, and how ETH reacts here will likely determine the next short-term trend. Since early May, ETH has been trading in a wide consolidation range between $2,400 and $2,800. The recent price action suggests ongoing indecision, with lower highs forming and strong support holding near the 200 SMA. Volume remains relatively muted, indicating a lack of strong directional conviction. Related Reading: Solana Key Indicator Flashes Buy Signal On Daily Chart – Rally Ahead? For bulls, reclaiming and holding above the 100 SMA is crucial for breaking out of the current range and targeting the $2,700–$2,800 region.

The flagship coin rallied over 4 percent in the last 24 hours to reach a local high of about $110,260, less than 2 percent from its all-time high, on Monday, June 9 during the late North American session. The wider altcoin market, led by Ethereum (ETH), followed in tandem. As a result, the total crypto Open Interest (OI) surged over 6 percent to hover about $154.8 billion at the time of this writing.

The language and content of the post raised immediate red flags among observers, prompting swift clarification from the Paraguayan government. On-chain analysis showed the attached wallet had minimal funds and no activity, suggesting a phishing attempt. Paraguay’s President, Santiago Peña, became the latest high-profile figure to fall victim to a social media hack after his official X account was compromised on Monday. The breach resulted in a fake announcement claiming the country had adopted Bitcoin as legal tender. Paraguay Denies Bitcoin Legal Tender Claim After Presidential Account Hack The message, written unusually in English rather than Spanish, declared that Paraguay had made Bitcoin an official currency. It also claimed the government had created a $5 million BTC reserve and launched a bond program for “crypto-enabled citizens.” The post urged users to send any amount of Bitcoin to a wallet address, supposedly to determine the scale of a national rollout. https://twitter.com/SantiPenap/status/1932125390153396541 Observers quickly flagged the message as suspicious. Many noted that the language and tone were inconsistent with previous communications from the president, who typically posts in Spanish. Shortly after the post went live, the platform flagged the account for “irregular activity,” according to an additional report. The Paraguayan government swiftly issued an official response. The presidential account posted a message in Spanish that read: “Información falsa. Comunicado oficial de la presidencia de la República del Paraguay.” This statement confirmed that the Bitcoin announcement was false. Comunicado oficial. pic.twitter.com/Bk3XI6ohpp — Presidencia Paraguay (@PresidenciaPy) June 9, 2025 However, the hacker attempted to conceal the government’s warning by hiding the official reply beneath the scam post. The fraudulent message remained live for a time, possibly misleading unsuspecting users. On-chain data revealed that the wallet address provided by the hacker held only $4 and had recorded no transactions since the announcement. Despite the low activity, the nature of the post resembled a classic crypto phishing scheme. Authorities urged the public not to trust any posts from the president’s account until further notice. Paraguay’s national cybersecurity team has launched an investigation and is working with X to resolve the incident and restore control over the account. “We ask citizens to ignore any messages from the presidential account until we confirm its security,” the government said. Ongoing Crypto Scam Wave Hits Political and Industry Targets Across Latin America The hacking of Paraguayan President Santiago Peña’s official X account adds to a growing string of high-profile social media compromises, many of which have targeted the crypto industry and public figures to spread misinformation and scams. Over the past year, threat actors have increasingly exploited X for crypto-related phishing attacks. In May 2025 alone, the X accounts of Ethereum Layer-2 project ZKsync and its developer Matter Labs, were breached . @zksync & @the_matter_labs official X accounts hacked to post fake SEC alerts & phishing airdrops—ZK token drops 5%. #zksync #sec #phishing https://t.co/j4Yx6HHaob — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 13, 2025 Hackers posted fraudulent messages claiming the protocol was under U.S. investigation and shared phishing links disguised as airdrops. Around the same time, the New York Post’s account was hijacked to impersonate journalists and lure crypto users into fake podcast offers via Telegram. Earlier in the year, Canadian regulators also flagged fake articles featuring political endorsements used to promote crypto scams. State-sponsored hackers from the Lazarus Group have also posed as VCs in fake Zoom meetings to steal users’ private keys.” Paraguay has shown no intention to follow El Salvador’s 2021 move, which remains in a legal gray area following an IMF agreement reached in late 2024. Meanwhile, Paraguay’s crypto scene is under pressure. As Bitcoin mining gains traction, thanks to the country’s hydroelectric surplus, regulatory tensions are rising. Industrial players warn that new electricity rates could drive miners away . With over 10,000 illicit mining rigs seized in 2024 and tensions rising around mining regulations, the misuse of official platforms for misinformation poses a real threat to public understanding in an already volatile sector.

Terrett tells her 238,200 followers on the social media platform X that the statement is “imminent.” “NEW: I’m hearing that a joint statement is imminent from the eight leading crypto trade associations, along with Uniswap and Jump, expressing their support for the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act (BRCA) being included in the latest version of the CLARITY Act.” The BRCA aims to provide clarity and certainty for developers, miners, and other innovators in the non-custodial crypto ecosystem. According to Terrett, the eight groups are the DeFi Education Fund, Coin Center, Solana Institute, Chamber of Digital Commerce, Blockchain Association, Crypto Council, Bitcoin Policy Institute and Paradigm, who say that the legislation is critical for protecting software developers and infrastructure providers who do not custody customer funds. “The amendment, originally introduced by GOP Majority Whip and now with bipartisan support from Rep Ritchie, is being viewed by many in the industry as a foundational policy safeguard for DeFi developers. ‘It’s critically important that we don’t treat open-source developers like traditional financial institutions,’ one policy lead told me. ‘The BRCA draws that line clearly and protects innovation.’ The joint statement urges lawmakers to include the BRCA in the CLARITY Act, the House’s digital asset market structure bill, which is expected to be marked up next week.” At time of writing, no statement has been issued.

2025-06-09T22:00:33,"Is Altcoin Season Still Coming? Why Bitcoin Is To Blame Despite Making ATHs","Despite Bitcoin’s historic rise above the $100,000 mark in early 2025, a growing number of crypto investors are left wondering when the long-anticipated altcoin season will begin. At the time of writing, the altcoin season index from BlockchainCenter has now dipped to a reading of 20, far below the 75 threshold typically required to confirm the start of an altcoin season. In a detailed post on social media platform X, van de Poppe addressed what is one of the most frequently asked questions in the crypto industry today: “When altseason?” Altcoin Season Missing Despite Bull Market Conditions According to analyst Michaël van de Poppe, this cycle has deviated significantly from historical patterns. His response to the growing question of an altcoin season relays the fact that while Bitcoin has made gains, the altcoin market continues to lag significantly behind, raising doubts about whether a true altseason will even arrive this cycle. Related Reading: Certified Analyst Says Bitcoin Dominance Could Reverse At 64% – Is It Time For Altcoin Season? In past cycles, altcoins followed Bitcoin’s rally within weeks or months. However, 2024 and the early part of 2025 have proven to be different. This, in turn, has been many investors expecting this cycle to play out the same getting hammered and losing their patience. Although some new meme coins had their brief moments of explosive growth in late 2024, the broader altcoin market has been largely suppressed since late 2021. Van de Poppe explains that most older altcoins failed to match Bitcoin’s performance in 2021, and that trend has only worsened in the current cycle. This has somewhat changed the expectation of a typical four-year cycle rhythm. The tables have turned and other variables need to be taken into account for investors looking to get a significant return in those markets. Bitcoin Dominance And Sentiment Imbalance Holding Altcoins Back One of the clearest reasons for the delay in altseason is Bitcoin’s overwhelming dominance. As the Altcoin Season Index indicates, the metric remains significantly below the 25 threshold line and firmly entrenched in Bitcoin Season territory. Van de Poppe attributes this not just to price action, but also to macro-level shifts, such as interest rate regimes and monetary policy from central banks. For now, there’s still much upside potential for Bitcoin, especially if the Fed interest rates were to go down from their current 4% levels. Related Reading: Is Altcoin Season Over Or It Never Started? Here’s What Historical Data Says In his view, the current market is divided into two camps: those expecting a bear market and those who believe the bull run is just beginning. Both could be wrong, he warns, because the game has changed. If there are so many factors going into negative sentiment, that’s actually a sign to allocate funds into altcoins. Keeping this in mind, the best time to invest in altcoins would be now, when the altcoin season isn’t showing any signs. Van de Poppe concludes that altseason isn’t just a timeframe but a phase where patient investors accumulate undervalued cryptocurrencies before the rest of the market catches on. When the altcoin season eventually rolls in, it will come unannounced.

2025-06-09T21:31:58,"Bitcoin Climbs Above $110K, 'At Crossroads' for Next Major Move","Bitcoin's BTC quiet climb on Monday accelerated to its strongest price in June, rebounding from last week's decline to near all-time high levels. The largest crypto advanced by 3.7% over the past 24 hours, topping $110,000, and it's changing hands by only 2% from its record prices observed in May. Ethereum's ether ETH kept pace with a 3.8% gain during the same period, bouncing above $2,620. Native tokens of Hyperliquid HYPE and SUI SUI outperformed most large-cap cryptocurrencies, rising 7% and 4.5%, respectively. Bitcoin's move higher caught leveraged traders off-guard, liquidating over $110 million worth of short positions within an hour, CoinGlass data shows. Across all crypto assets, some $330 million of shorts were liquidated during the day, the most in a month. Shorts are seeking to profit from declining asset prices. The move happened while traditional markets showed muted action, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes flat on the day. Crypto-related stocks bounced during the session to catch up with BTC's recovery over the weekend. ""A 'peaceful rally' is a perfect way to describe this price action,"" said well-followed analyst Caleb Franzen, founder of Cubic Analytics. ""Just a consistent development of higher highs and higher lows. Any signs of weakness? Buyers step in and defend the trend."" The crypto market is now on steadier footing for a potential next leg higher after bitcoin's 10% decline to near $100,000 and with more than $1.9 billion in liquidations across crypto derivatives over the past week, having flushed excessive leverage, Bitfinex analysts noted in a Monday report. However, on-chain data indicates rising sell pressure from long-term holders that could overwhelm demand, the analysts added. “Bitcoin is now at a crossroads—balanced between structural support and waning bullish momentum, waiting for its next macro cue,” the Bitfinex note added. Those macro catalysts may come later this week, noted Jake O, OTC trader at crypto trading firm Wintermute. ""U.S. and Chinese trade representatives are scheduled to meet today, with markets likely sensitive to any headlines following last week's positive momentum, and the data calendar remains light until Wednesday, when CPI will offer fresh insight into U.S. inflation,"" he said.

2025-06-09T21:30:51,"Bernstein Analysts Say Ethereum Is the Face of Blockchain Innovation","Analysts at Bernstein believe the digital market is changing. While Bitcoin (BTC) is still leading the crypto market, something new is happening. Big financial companies now use public blockchains like Ethereum (ETH) to build new financial tools. Analysts think this is only the beginning of how traditional finance will grow using blockchain. Bitcoin Leads, But Ethereum is Catching Up Bitcoin, seen as a safe haven , continues to be the most well-known cryptocurrency. In early 2024, Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were launched in the U.S. and quickly became very popular. These funds now manage over $120 billion in assets. Ethereum ETFs were launched later but have seen less capital inflow, about $9 billion. This is expected because the coin is still smaller than Bitcoin in total value. Even so, interest in Ethereum is rising. Spot Ethereum ETFs reportedly saw their third consecutive week of inflows . This shows that more people are starting to see the value in Ethereum. Analysts Think ETH Is More Than Just a Coin Bernstein analysts think Ethereum is different from Bitcoin. Bitcoin is mainly seen as a way to store value, like gold. Ethereum is like a computer that anyone can use. People can build apps and financial tools on it. Two primary uses of ETH are stablecoins and tokenization. Stablecoins are digital dollars that are easy to send and use. Tokenization means turning real-world things, like property or stocks, into digital tokens—these run mainly on the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum is Gaining Value Through Use Some investors used to say that crypto is not valuable, but blockchain is. Now, they are starting to see that both are connected. If stablecoins and tokens are helpful, then the network that powers them, like ETH, is also valuable. Ethereum earns fees when people use its apps. This means there is real demand for the network. Big names in finance and tech are now using ETH’s features. Companies like Visa, Mastercard, and Stripe are working on ways to use stablecoins for payments. These stablecoins often run on the ETH network. Crypto companies are also building more valuable products. Coinbase is testing stablecoin payments for businesses. Robinhood is working on turning real-world assets into tokens. Kraken plans to let international users trade tokenized U.S. stocks. These are not just crypto trading tools but financial products built on blockchain. This means ETH is now part of real financial innovation, not just online coin trading. As more companies and users build on Ethereum , it becomes more important and valuable.

2025-06-09T21:22:35,"Malaysia’s Crypto Mining to Soar 110% in 2025 as $100 Million Power Theft Persists","A new report by the ACCESS Blockchain Association of Malaysia predicts a sharp rise in legal mining activity, driven by infrastructure investment, expanding data center capacity, and increased institutional interest. Yet, electricity theft tied to illegal mining operations continues to erode grid stability and investor confidence. According to the report, the national utility provider Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) stated that Malaysia suffered power losses exceeding RM441 million ($100M) between 2020 and 2024, largely due to unauthorized mining setups siphoning electricity directly from the grid. These illicit operations, often concealed in residential or commercial buildings, not only endanger public safety but also place additional stress on the country’s power infrastructure. The ACCESS report notes that Malaysia has the potential to benefit economically from crypto mining, but must first resolve internal regulatory and infrastructural challenges to fully realize that opportunity. Malaysia’s Mining Growth Potential Undermined by Regulatory Gaps and Illicit Activity Malaysia’s persistent regulatory ambiguity and hidden illegal operations continue to stall the progress of its cryptocurrency mining industry, according to a new report by the ACCESS Blockchain Association. The report estimates that formalizing the sector could lead to RM700 million in hardware and infrastructure investments this year alone, creating up to 4,000 jobs and contributing approximately RM150 million in annual tax revenue. Despite these prospects, many legal operators remain under the radar due to security concerns and policy uncertainty. Source: ACCESS Blockchain Association Malaysia currently ranks among the top 10 countries globally by Bitcoin hash rate share. The country’s competitive industrial electricity rates, particularly in East Sarawak, have made it an attractive destination for crypto mining. However, the absence of a mining-specific license continues to hamper broader industry development. While the Securities Commission (SC) oversees digital asset trading and custody, no regulatory body governs the mining process. This has left industry participants facing unclear electricity tariffs, licensing requirements, and environmental compliance standards. “Crucially, while the SC regulates the digital assets that miners produce, if deemed securities and traded or offered in Malaysia—its current guidelines do not appear to provide a specific regulatory framework or licensing regime for the act of mining itself,” the report noted. “The focus remains on the exchange, offering, and safekeeping of assets post-creation. This lack of a dedicated mining framework is a major source of regulatory uncertainty.” Urgent Need for Reform to Tackle Illegal Mining and Build a Sustainable Industry Malaysia’s mining industry mirrors a regional pattern. Countries like Thailand and Indonesia are also grappling with illegal operations and infrastructure abuse. According to a report, incidents of power theft linked to unauthorized mining operations jumped nearly 300% between 2018 and 2024, with 2,397 cases recorded. The spike has drawn concern from Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB), the national utility provider, and threatens to undercut investor confidence in the digital asset sector’s long-term viability. There were 610 detected cases of power thefts in 2018, linked to illegal crypto mining, which surged to 2,397 in 2024, Malaysia TNB noted. #MalaysiaCryptoMining #BitcoinMining #ElectricityConsumption https://t.co/Xmnl4pXXhx — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 12, 2025 The ACCESS report recommends a coordinated strategy that includes the introduction of dedicated mining licenses, reforms to landlord liability laws, and energy pricing models tied to sustainability metrics. While TNB has initiated efforts to roll out smart meters and deploy data analytics tools to detect unauthorized consumption, enforcement remains fragmented across multiple government bodies, weakening overall deterrence. One of the report’s key proposals is the development of Shariah-compliant mining models. Given Malaysia’s leadership in Islamic finance, the report suggests leveraging this advantage by creating ethical mining operations that prioritize transparent governance and renewable energy.

2025-06-09T20:40:24,"BlackRock’s IBIT ETF hit $70 billion in assets after just 341 days","BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF just pulled off something no other ETF has done this fast. The IBIT fund crossed $70 billion in assets under management after 341 days of trading, making it the fastest ETF to ever reach that level, according to Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. Eric posted on X, saying, “IBIT just blew through $70 billion and is now the fastest ETF to ever hit that mark in only 341 days, which is 5x faster than the old record held by GLD of 1,691 days.” IBIT is now leading the entire crypto ETF pack with a massive gap. The closest rival, Fidelity’s spot Bitcoin ETF, has around $31 billion in assets, based on tracking from The Block’s dashboard. That’s not even close. Over the last month, IBIT also saw 34 days straight of inflows, which means investors were buying into the fund every single day for more than four weeks. This is all happening during a time when both Bitcoin and gold are seeing solid performance. One of the major factors driving this movement is economic uncertainty caused by trade policies under President Donald Trump. BlackRock launched IBIT in January and now holds 2.8% of Bitcoin supply BlackRock introduced the IBIT fund in January 2024, and it didn’t take long for it to start eating up a serious portion of the Bitcoin market. By April, the fund held 2.8% of the total circulating Bitcoin, according to data from Arkham Intelligence. That means nearly 3 out of every 100 BTC in existence are sitting in this one fund. But the firm isn’t buying Bitcoin for itself — it’s holding it on behalf of its clients. The previous ETF record-holder was SPDR Gold Shares, better known as GLD. That fund lets people invest in gold without buying physical bars or coins, and it’s been around since November 2004. GLD is still the largest physically backed gold ETF globally and manages around $100 billion in total assets. But while it still holds more money overall, it took nearly five years to hit the $70 billion mark — way slower than IBIT’s less-than-a-year sprint. Market signals suggest traders should slow down as risk climbs While IBIT continues growing , signs in the broader Bitcoin market suggest that it might not be the best time to make new aggressive moves. The 60-day Realized Cap Variance (RCV), which tracks market volatility and momentum, has officially left the “buy” zone. That window usually opens when conditions are low-risk and momentum is improving. But now, those yellow buy signals have disappeared. Even though the RCV hasn’t hit red yet — which would mean it’s time to sell — it’s creeping into the neutral-to-high risk range, going over 0.3. That means prices are heating up, and the odds of getting in at a good value are shrinking. One thing keeping this from being a clear sell is the 30-day momentum, which is still positive. That’s the only reason we haven’t seen a red sell flag yet. A full-on sell signal would need three things: RCV above +1, negative 30-day momentum, and a falling trend. So far, none of those have lined up. But traders are still being cautious. Smart investors aren’t jumping in like it’s January anymore. Instead, they’re watching for changes in the chart and thinking about locking in profits if the data starts flashing red. The current phase is being described as risk-elevated but not overheated. The earlier accumulation zone — when Bitcoin was relatively cheap and the momentum was building — is over. Anyone still thinking about buying in should know they missed the low-risk opportunity. Right now, the data says to hold back, not go all in. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

The software is built to support everything from small-scale DIY rigs to large industrial mining farms. The initiative could spur a wave of new entrants, and help decentralize mining and strengthen network resilience. Tether, the issuer of the USDT stablecoin, is preparing to open-source its Bitcoin mining operating system, a move that could shake up the mining industry and lower barriers for new entrants. Announced by CEO Paolo Ardoino, the initiative seeks to provide smaller or independent miners with tools that typically require expensive third-party software or infrastructure. The software, known as the Mining Operating System (MOS), is designed to scale from small, DIY setups to large, industrial mining sites. Tether Expands Bitcoin Mining Push with Open-Source Operating System Ardoino wrote in his post announcing the plans, “Make mining great again.” He said the goal is to reduce dependence on centralized mining software providers and offer a more level playing field between small miners and publicly listed firms. Tether’s MOS is built with a modular, peer-to-peer architecture, making it highly flexible. It can run on systems as simple as a Raspberry Pi or scale up to support massive mining operations involving hundreds of thousands of machines. Tether will work towards open-sourcing its Bitcoin Mining OS (MOS). A horde of new Bitcoin mining companies will be able to enter the game and compete to keep the network safe. No need anymore of any 3rd party hosted software. MOS will create an even playing field reducing the… — Paolo Ardoino (@paoloardoino) June 9, 2025 The system already supports a wide range of mining hardware and power setups, including air-cooled and immersion-based container designs. This move could have broad implications for the mining sector. Publicly listed mining companies have historically had an edge due to access to better software tools and infrastructure. Tether’s decision to release MOS could close that gap, empowering smaller operators to enter or scale up their participation in Bitcoin mining. Another angle to this move is energy. Ardoino believes that more small and mid-sized businesses that generate their own electricity, such as through solar, will begin using excess power to mine Bitcoin. While no release date for the open-source version was provided, the announcement adds another layer to Tether’s growing involvement in Bitcoin mining and infrastructure. The company has previously invested in mining operations and energy initiatives, especially in Latin America. Miners Face Tight Margins as AI, Hashrate Wars Reshape Post-Halving Environment Tether’s push into open-source AI and mining software comes at a time when Bitcoin miners face one of the most challenging post-halving environments to date. Since the April 2025 halving cut block rewards to 3.125 BTC, many public miners have shifted from HODLing to selling. According to TheMinerMag, over 40% of mined BTC was offloaded by 15 firms in March alone. Some, like HIVE and Bitfarms, sold more than their total monthly production, a sign of rising operational strain. The pressure is mounting as the Bitcoin network’s hash rate hit a record one sextillion hashes per second in April, and mining difficulty reached a new high of 121.51 trillion in May, after a 6.81% jump. Bitcoin’s hashrate hits all-time high, but miners are selling more BTC as revenue plunges post-halving — can the network’s security surge outpace financial pressures? #Bitcoin #Mining https://t.co/D7931KDQW2 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 17, 2025 Meanwhile, miner revenue in March plunged 50% year-over-year, dropping to just $1.2 billion. The hashprice, a key metric of mining profitability, has barely recovered, hovering around $54 per PH/s. To stay afloat, some firms are shifting to AI. HIVE has already reported stronger income from AI workloads than crypto mining, prompting heavier investment in compute infrastructure. Others, like Cango, have gone all-in on mining, producing over 950 BTC across April and May after exiting legacy operations in China. Tether’s AI initiative could support that trend, blending decentralized compute with native crypto payments and offering a new path for miners eyeing survival through diversification. In this new chapter, miners may need more than hardware to keep their edge.

Which of $ETH, $SOL, or $SUI could make the highest shorter term gains? $ETH 1 month of sideways price action about to end? Source: TradingView After breaking up through the descending trendline that stretched from mid-December 2024 to early May 2025, the $ETH price shot skywards for a 50% gain. However, the resistance at $2,700 held firm, and $ETH has traversed in a range between this level and the $2,400 support. It would perhaps appear to be a matter of time before the $ETH price breaks up and past this overhead resistance and moves on up to $3,500. The longer $ETH continues to trend sideways, the more explosive and higher the next move could be. $SOL breaks up past descending trendline Source: TradingView The daily time frame for $SOL illustrates how the price went down to exactly touch the 0.5 Fibonacci level, which is a relatively deep level to come down to. It bounced from there and has today broken beyond a short-term descending trendline. The daily Stochastic RSI has the indicators trending upwards and therefore there could be room for the $SOL bulls to try and make a local higher high beyond $187, which happens to be an important horizontal resistance level. If the $SOL price can consolidate above this level, this would open the path back to the all-time high. $SUI getting a bounce from major support level Source: TradingView The $SUI price is seen in the higher time frame of the weekly. This is because support and resistance can be clearly seen on this level. Last week’s candle body closed above the $3.19 horizontal support, leaving a good wick underneath, which provides evidence that the bulls came in strongly to hold this level. A bounce looks as though it is taking place now, and should the price rise above the current resistance level, the next stop could be $4. At the bottom of the chart the weekly Stochastic RSI indicators may be starting to flatten out. If they can continue to do so, and perhaps get a bounce at the 50.00 level, all systems are go for $SUI. If all the positive price action plays out for these three layer 1s, $ETH could be set to rise 36% from its current price level, $SOL 20%, and $SUI 20%. Of course, much depends how heavily investors get behind any particular one of these altcoins. It should also be borne in mind that the $ETH market cap is around 4 times bigger than $SOL, and around 30 times bigger than $SUI. Therefore, the amount needed to move the $SOL price is relatively less, and for the $SUI price much more so. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-06-09T20:30:10,"Bitcoin Calm Won’t Last—This Week Holds Breakout Risk","Singapore-based trading firm QCP Capital opened its Monday note with a blunt assessment: “Implied vols continue to come under pressure, with BTC stuck in a tight range as summer approaches.” In the options house’s telling, the market is drifting into the northern-hemisphere holiday season much as it did a year ago, when one-month at-the-money (ATM) volatility collapsed from 80 vols in March to barely 40 vols by July and spot repeatedly “failed to decisively breach the $70k level.” The difference this year is the new, higher plateau: BTC has sat between $100,000 and $110,000 for most of the past three weeks. The calm is visible beyond Deribit’s options screens. Deribit’s DVOL index, which tracks 30-day implied volatility, is hovering just above 40—one of its lowest prints in more than two years. Realised volatility is even quieter, so even one-year lows on implieds still look “optically rich,” QCP argues. That valuation gap has encouraged traders to sell gamma: perpetual open interest has slipped and the favourite hedge-fund basis trade—long spot via the new ETFs, short futures—has unwound, taking what QCP calls “the natural bid for vol” out of the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin At A Crossroads: $97,000 Cost Basis Holds Key To Next Breakout Flows in the listed options market confirm the malaise. Dealers report that July upside strikes around $130,000 and $140,000 are being rolled out to September “in meaningful size,” effectively pushing bullish timelines further down the curve. Meanwhile, Deribit’s put-skew has flattened as short-dated hedges expire worthless—a dynamic that often precedes a directional move once macro catalysts arrive. This Week Could Break Bitcoin’s Lull Those catalysts line up uncomfortably close. On Wednesday the Bureau of Labor Statistics will publish May consumer-price data. April’s headline CPI rose a modest 0.2% month-on-month and 2.3% year-on-year, while core prices advanced 0.2% on the month and 2.8% on the year. Economists look for headline CPI to quicken to 0.3% on the month and 2.5% year-on-year, with core CPI seen edging up to 0.3% and 2.9% respectively. Producer prices follow on Thursday: April’s PPI fell 0.5% on the month yet still printed 2.4% year-on-year. The consensus expects May PPI to rebound 0.2%, leaving the annual rate near 2.4%. Inflation is not the only macro variable in play. Friday’s stronger-than-expected US non-farm payrolls report—139,000 jobs versus a 130,000 consensus—rekindled dollar strength and knocked gold more than one percent lower, but BTC “remained conspicuously unmoved,” QCP noted. The same divergence is visible this morning: US equity futures are slightly softer, spot gold is bid on safe-haven demand, and bitcoin is trading virtually unchanged. Geopolitics may supply the spark that inflation data has so far failed to ignite. Senior US and Chinese officials meet in London today (Monday) in what both sides are calling a push for a limited trade deal that would dial back export-control threats and myriad retaliatory tariffs. The talks matter for crypto because tariffs have been feeding directly into the CPI basket and—via global risk sentiment—into bitcoin demand. “A clean break below $100k or above $110k would likely reawaken broader market interest,” QCP wrote, “but we currently see no obvious near-term catalyst to drive such a move.” Trade headlines could change that calculus in a single newsflash. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says This Bitcoin Top Signal Hasn’t Gone Off Yet — What To Know Institutional positioning likewise hints at fatigue. US regulatory filings show that large hedge funds trimmed spot-ETF holdings in the first quarter as the lucrative cash-and-carry spread compressed. Net inflows across the 11 US bitcoin ETFs have slowed to a trickle since late May, leaving cumulative additions at roughly $44 billion—unchanged for almost a fortnight, according to Farside data. For now, the market’s centre of gravity is exactly where QCP says it is: inside the $100,000–$110,000 corridor. Volatility sellers continue to collect premium, and the risk-reward for momentum traders remains poor. Yet with CPI, PPI and high-stakes trade negotiations all landing inside a 72-hour window, the premium that option writers are harvesting could quickly look meagre. If the inflation data surprise to the upside, a repricing of Fed-cut expectations could turn last week’s equity rally into a risk-off wobble, yanking bitcoin below six figures for the first time since April. Conversely, a benign print combined with even a symbolic easing of tariff rhetoric could flip the narrative to “soft landing, structural bid via ETFs,” reigniting topside optionality into the June quarter-end. In that scenario the rolled-out September $140,000 calls might come alive far sooner than their buyers now expect. Either way, the clock on bitcoin’s summer doldrums is ticking loudly. “Without a compelling narrative to spark the next leg higher, signs of fatigue are emerging,” QCP warns. The narrative candidates arrive this week; whether they supply ignition or simply more noise will decide whether 2025’s range trade breaks—or cements itself as the dominant theme of another crypto summer. At press time, BTC traded at $107,919.

2025-06-09T20:27:31,"Experts Say XRP Could Hit $50 and $100. Here’s the Math","Despite current price limitations and market challenges, there remains persistent speculation about XRP reaching high-value targets such as $50 or even $100. Several commentators and crypto analysts continue to advocate for the possibility of this major price appreciation. However, the feasibility of such projections depends heavily on broader market conditions and XRP’s place within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Analysts Supporting High Price Predictions In recent months, voices in the crypto space have suggested aggressive price expectations for XRP. In April, analyst Cryptominder projected that XRP could rise to $50 within the next five years. BarriC, a frequent commentator, has reiterated expectations of XRP hitting $100 , while the founder of Alpha Lions Academy noted that a $50 milestone could prompt the market to begin aiming for the $100 level. Current Market Metrics and Supply Considerations At present, XRP has a circulating supply nearing 59 billion tokens. Based on this figure, reaching $50 would result in a market capitalization of approximately $2.95 trillion. This would not only surpass Bitcoin’s current market cap of $2.06 trillion but also outpace the valuations of major global entities such as Alphabet, Amazon, and the total value of silver. A price of $100 would double XRP’s market cap to $5.9 trillion, nearly double the entire cryptocurrency market’s current capitalization, which stands at around $3.24 trillion. From its current price of $2.26, XRP would need to increase by approximately 2,112% to reach $50, and by around 4,235% to achieve a price of $100. These are substantial gains that, under current conditions, appear unlikely. Evaluating Market Conditions for Future Price Potential While these figures may seem unrealistic under existing market circumstances, they are not inherently unattainable. A substantial expansion in the overall crypto market could make higher XRP prices more plausible. For instance, Dan Gambardello, a known advocate of Cardano, has projected that the total cryptocurrency market cap could eventually rise to $40 trillion. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 In a scenario where Bitcoin retains its current market dominance of about 63.5%, it would command a market cap of approximately $25.4 trillion. If XRP were to attain a $50 valuation within that environment, it would represent just over 5% of the global crypto market, an achievable target considering XRP reached a dominance level of 5.56% as recently as February. Achieving a $100 price would require XRP to capture about 14.75% of a $40 trillion market. While this is a more ambitious figure, it remains within the boundaries of historical precedent. Notably, XRP reached a market dominance peak of 31.33% in mid-2017. The idea of XRP reaching $50 or $100 is not without merit, but it requires a fundamental shift in the broader crypto landscape. Current market caps and circulating supply make such valuations impractical today. However, under a dramatically expanded global market, such as a projected $40 trillion crypto space, these price points may become viable, assuming XRP can maintain or increase its market share. As such, while these targets are speculative, they are not beyond the realm of possibility in the long term.

Inside BRCA: What the Bill Actually Does News of BRCA’s latest advancement comes just days after the crypto policy organizations joined together to push for its inclusion in the high-profile digital asset legislation . If passed, BRCA would certify that crypto software developers will not be treated as financial entities under the Bank Secrecy Act. “As much-needed digital asset regulation develops in the United States, it is critically important to remember that developers creating peer-to-peer, noncustodial software and the infrastructure providers who enable decentralized networks have little in common with traditional financial institutions and should not be treated as such,” a June 5 statement reads in part. Meanwhile, the CLARITY Act would provide digital asset market participants with a clear crypto regulatory framework and is scheduled for a markup by the House Financial Services Committee (HFSC) on Tuesday afternoon. “By providing strong safeguards and long-overdue regulatory certainty, the legislation advances American innovation and reinforces America’s leadership in the global financial system,” a fact sheet from the HFSC reads .

2025-06-09T20:20:23,"Bitcoin Mining Revolution: Tether Unveils Powerful Open Source MOS","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Mining Revolution: Tether Unveils Powerful Open Source MOS The world of Bitcoin Mining is constantly evolving, driven by innovation and the pursuit of greater efficiency and accessibility. A significant development recently emerged from a major player in the cryptocurrency space: Tether . Known primarily for its stablecoin USDT, Tether is now making waves in the mining sector with a move that could reshape how operations are managed. What is Tether’s Open Source Mining OS? Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino recently announced a pivotal step for the company’s venture into Bitcoin mining infrastructure. Tether is open-sourcing its Mining OS , a specialized operating system designed specifically for managing Bitcoin Mining operations. This isn’t just a basic piece of software; it’s described as a modular and scalable platform. Think of it as the central nervous system for a mining farm. Whether you’re running a small setup in a garage or managing an industrial-scale facility with thousands of machines, this Mining OS is built to handle the complexity. Its modular design means it can be adapted and scaled to fit various operational sizes and needs. Key features highlighted include: Built-in support for a wide range of mining machines (ASICs). Compatibility with different cooling systems. Integration capabilities for electrical equipment monitoring. A framework for developers to create and add custom plugins. This comprehensive approach aims to provide miners with a unified platform to monitor, control, and optimize their entire operation. Why Did Tether Choose the Open Source Path? Tether’s decision to make its Mining OS Open Source is a strategic one with multiple stated goals. According to Ardoino, a primary motivation is to reduce the reliance on third-party, often proprietary, software solutions that miners currently depend on. This dependency can sometimes lead to vendor lock-in, limited customization, and potential security concerns if the software isn’t transparently developed or audited. By releasing the software under an Open Source license, Tether is inviting the broader community to inspect, use, modify, and contribute to the code. This fosters transparency, allowing anyone to see exactly how the system works, which is crucial in a security-sensitive industry like Crypto Mining . Furthermore, the move is intended to promote broader participation in Bitcoin Mining . Proprietary software can be expensive or have licensing restrictions that make it less accessible, especially for smaller operators. An open-source alternative, typically free to use and modify, lowers the barrier to entry and provides a powerful tool that was previously only available through potentially costly commercial agreements. This initiative could potentially help narrow the technological gap between large corporations with significant R&D budgets and smaller, independent miners. By providing access to sophisticated management tools, Tether aims to empower a wider range of participants in securing the Bitcoin network. The Benefits of an Open Source Mining OS The Open Source model brings several inherent advantages when applied to a critical tool like a Mining OS : Transparency: The code is publicly available, allowing anyone to audit it for bugs, inefficiencies, or malicious code. This builds trust and security. Community Collaboration: Developers from around the world can contribute to improving the software, adding new features, fixing bugs, and ensuring compatibility with new hardware. This accelerates development and innovation. Flexibility and Customization: Miners or developers can modify the software to suit their specific needs, integrate it with other systems, or develop custom plugins for unique functionalities. Reduced Costs: Typically, open-source software is free to use, eliminating licensing fees associated with proprietary solutions. While development or support costs might still exist, the base software is freely available. Increased Security: With many eyes on the code, vulnerabilities are often discovered and patched more quickly than in closed-source projects. For Bitcoin Mining operations, these benefits translate directly into potentially more efficient, more reliable, and more adaptable systems for managing their valuable hardware and resources. How Does This Impact the Crypto Mining Landscape? Tether’s entry into the Open Source Mining OS space could have several ripple effects on the broader Crypto Mining industry. Currently, miners often rely on software provided by ASIC manufacturers or third-party companies. This can lead to a fragmented ecosystem with varying levels of quality, support, and features. A robust, community-driven Open Source alternative has the potential to become a standard, or at least a widely adopted option. This could: Drive innovation across the board as other software providers might need to compete with the features and flexibility offered by the open-source alternative. Make it easier for new entrants to get started in Bitcoin Mining by providing free access to powerful management tools. Improve the overall security posture of mining operations if a widely audited and secure OS becomes available. Foster a more collaborative environment among miners and developers working on the same software base. It’s a move that aligns with the decentralized ethos of Bitcoin itself, providing tools that are not controlled by a single entity, but rather developed and maintained by a community. Exploring the Features: More Than Just Basic Monitoring The description of Tether’s Mining OS points to a platform designed for comprehensive management. Support for various mining machines is fundamental, allowing miners to integrate different models and brands into a single interface. This is particularly useful for larger operations that might use hardware from multiple vendors. Integration with cooling systems (like immersion cooling or traditional air cooling setups) and electrical equipment is also critical. Efficient cooling and power management are key to maximizing profitability and extending the lifespan of mining hardware. The ability to monitor and control these aspects through the same OS streamlines operations significantly. The plugin architecture is perhaps one of the most exciting aspects for developers and advanced users. This allows for customization and expansion beyond the core features. Imagine plugins for advanced data analytics, integration with specific monitoring hardware, automated response systems based on temperature or performance metrics, or even integration with renewable energy sources. This extensibility ensures the Mining OS can evolve and adapt to the future needs and technological advancements in the Crypto Mining space. What’s Next? Adoption and Development While the announcement is promising, the success of Tether’s Open Source Mining OS will ultimately depend on adoption and community engagement. Will miners embrace this new tool? Will developers contribute to its growth and improvement? For miners looking for alternatives to proprietary software, this presents a compelling option to explore. Getting involved early could mean influencing the direction of the software and benefiting from a transparent, community-supported platform. For developers interested in Bitcoin Mining technology, contributing to an open-source Mining OS offers an opportunity to work on a high-impact project within the industry, gain experience, and contribute to a tool used globally. Potential Challenges Like any new software, especially one that is Open Source , there will be challenges. Initial adoption might be slow as miners evaluate its stability and features compared to existing solutions. Community contributions need to be managed effectively to ensure code quality and security. Support might rely heavily on community forums and documentation initially. However, given Tether’s resources and commitment, and the inherent benefits of the Open Source model, there is significant potential for this project to become a valuable asset for the entire Bitcoin Mining ecosystem. A Bold Step for Tether and Bitcoin Mining Tether’s decision to open-source its Bitcoin Mining Operating System is a bold and potentially transformative step. By providing a free, transparent, modular, and scalable tool, they are not only reducing reliance on proprietary software but also actively working to make Bitcoin Mining more accessible and efficient for a broader range of participants. This move aligns with the core principles of decentralization and community collaboration that underpin Bitcoin. As the project develops and gains traction, it will be exciting to see how the community leverages this powerful new tool to innovate and strengthen the global Crypto Mining infrastructure.

2025-06-09T20:17:38,"Analyst Says Altseason Will Come and XRP Will Explode. Here’s the Timeline","A notable shift may be looming on the cryptocurrency horizon, as seasoned analyst CryptoBull forecasts the arrival of a major altseason, a phase in which alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) outperform Bitcoin in market gains. Among the altcoins expected to surge significantly is XRP, the digital asset associated with Ripple. According to CryptoBull, market dynamics suggest that a decisive transition from Bitcoin to altcoins is likely to unfold within the next three months—a development that could catalyze explosive growth for XRP and other undervalued tokens. Bitcoin Dominance in a Rising Wedge The technical foundation of CryptoBull’s prediction is rooted in the Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) chart, which tracks Bitcoin’s market share relative to the entire cryptocurrency market. As of early June, BTC.D has been charting a rising wedge pattern—a formation traditionally viewed as bearish, particularly when appearing in an overextended trend. Altseason will come and #XRP will explode. Bitcoin dominance is in a rising wedge getting closer to the apex. Within the next 3 months we will see a shift from Bitcoin to altcoins. pic.twitter.com/vJgCzxoOpd — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) June 9, 2025 The wedge is narrowing toward its apex, indicating a potential breakdown that would signal waning strength for Bitcoin relative to the broader altcoin market. Historically, when BTC dominance experienced similar wedge breakdowns, it was followed by significant capital shifts into altcoins, resulting in widespread price increases. According to CryptoBull, this cyclical trend remains consistent, with technical indicators showing that a shift in dominance is not only possible but imminent. XRP Poised for a Breakout Among the altcoins that stand to benefit from this rotation, XRP takes center stage. Even though many investors view the asset as fundamentally undervalued, particularly in light of Ripple’s expanding global presence and its push to integrate real-world asset (RWA) tokenization into financial markets, CryptoBull emphasizes that XRP is primed for a significant move, supported by both technical patterns and broader market catalysts. From a technical perspective, XRP has been forming a long-term consolidation pattern, building support levels that analysts believe could soon give way to a parabolic breakout once market sentiment shifts decisively toward altcoins. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Macro Catalysts and Timeline CryptoBull’s forecast aligns with broader macroeconomic and market conditions. Historically, altseasons have followed key phases in the Bitcoin cycle—often when Bitcoin consolidates after a strong upward move, giving traders confidence to diversify into higher-risk assets. With Bitcoin having rallied sharply in Q1 2025 and now trading in a relatively tight range, the stage appears set for capital rotation. The next three months are seen as pivotal . CryptoBull believes that as Bitcoin dominance begins to decline from the rising wedge formation, liquidity will start flowing into the altcoin sector. This timeline aligns with past market cycles, such as in early 2018 and mid-2021, when altcoin surges followed Bitcoin’s peak performance. Additionally, growing institutional engagement with XRP and the XRPL, including integrations of Ripple’s technology in regions such as the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America, enhances the token’s appeal. As utility narratives gain traction, particularly around stablecoins and tokenized assets, XRP’s real-world applications may become a central driver of price appreciation during the next wave of altcoin enthusiasm. If history is any guide, the next three months could mark the beginning of a powerful altseason, one that sees XRP finally make good on its long-anticipated breakout. As the crypto market evolves and narratives mature, XRP is increasingly viewed not just as a speculative asset but as a cornerstone of future financial infrastructure.
