2025-06-10T05:54:02,"Crypto Regulations in Slovenia 2025","The post Crypto Regulations in Slovenia 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Slovenia, a small but highly developed European country with a population of 2.1 million, boasts a rich industrial history that has significantly contributed to its robust economy. As the most economically developed Slavic nation, Slovenia has consistently grown since adopting the Euro in 2007. Its openness to innovation has been a key driver of success in the industrial sector, making it a favored destination for crypto enthusiasts. Many believe Slovenia is poised to become a powerful fintech hub in Europe. But does its current crypto regulatory framework support such aspirations? Let’s explore Slovenia’s crypto regulations and see if they can propel the country to the forefront of the cryptocurrency landscape. My expectation is positive. What’s yours? Before answering, let’s delve deeper. 1. Crypto Regulations in Slovenia: An Overview Slovenia is renowned for its pro-innovation stance, providing a supportive environment for emerging technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Under the Act on Payments Services and Systems, cryptocurrencies are classified as virtual assets rather than financial or monetary instruments. Regulation of the crypto sector in Slovenia is decentralized. Various authorities manage different aspects of the ecosystem. For instance, the Bank of Slovenia and the Securities Market Agency oversee cryptocurrency transactions to ensure compliance with financial laws, including Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Anti-Terrorist Financing regulations. The Slovenian Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Act (ZPPDFT-2) incorporates the EU’s 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5MLD) and aligns with the latest FATF recommendations. All virtual currency service providers must register with the Office of the Republic of Slovenia. 2. Crypto Regulations in Slovenia: What’s New? Several notable developments in Slovenia’s crypto sector occurred this year: July 25, 2024 : Slovenia issued a €30 million sovereign digital on-chain bond, the first of its kind in the EU, with a 3.65% return, maturing on November 25, 2024. July 1, 2024 : NiceHash announced Slovenia’s first Bitcoin -focused conference, NiceHashX, scheduled for November 8–9 in Maribor. Thank you @CoinEdition for sharing and spreading the news! Come and join us at our NiceHashX conference in Maribor Slovenia in November! https://t.co/AM5XNvOVgI — NiceHashX (@NiceHash_X) July 1, 2024 3. Crypto Taxation Framework in Slovenia Explained Slovenia’s crypto taxation framework provides clear guidelines for both individuals and corporations. According to the Financial Administration of Slovenia, the tax treatment depends on the trader’s status and the nature of the transaction. Individuals : Income earned from cryptocurrencies through employment or ongoing business activities is subject to personal income tax. However, capital gains from trading or market fluctuations are exempt from taxation. Corporations : Capital gains from cryptocurrency activities are subject to a corporate income tax of 19%. The Value-Added Tax (VAT) generally applies at a rate of 22%, although cryptocurrency transactions considered means of payment are exempt from VAT. Companies are not allowed to restrict payment methods to cryptocurrencies alone. Tokens issued during ICOs must follow standard accounting rules and the Law on Corporation Tax. 4. Crypto Mining in Slovenia: What You Should Know Crypto mining is unrestricted in Slovenia, but income from mining is considered business income and is therefore taxable. This includes rewards from validating transactions and any additional income from mining operations. Both individuals and legal entities must comply with Slovenian tax regulations. 5. Timeline of the Evolution of Crypto Regulations in Slovenia Here is a timeline highlighting the evolution of crypto regulations in Slovenia: 2023 : The EU adopted the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), establishing a uniform regulatory framework for crypto-assets, their issuers, and service providers across the EU 2017 : The Financial Administration of Slovenia provided more detailed guidelines on cryptocurrency taxation, based on factors such as the trader’s status and the type of transaction. 2013 : The Slovenian Financial Administration issued guidelines stating that income from cryptocurrency transactions should be taxed. Endnote Slovenia’s approach to the crypto sector is commendable, reflecting its optimistic view of the future of cryptocurrencies. The country’s balanced regulatory framework supports crypto innovation while protecting user rights and preventing illegal activities. Recent developments show Slovenia’s commitment to continually improving its regulatory environment. Slovenia’s crypto regulation framework sets a positive example for other nations navigating the evolving crypto landscape. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-10T05:52:22,"SEC chair Paul Atkins proposes “innovation exemption” to spur onchain development","Under the leadership of Paul Atkins, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is looking to fast-track crypto innovation through exemptions and tailored rulemaking. During the fifth meeting of the SEC’s Crypto Task Force roundtable titled DeFi and the American Spirit, Atkins outlined plans for a new “innovation exemption” that would provide conditional relief from certain regulatory requirements. While broader regulatory changes remain under development, the exemptions would provide a temporary structure to support the safe deployment of onchain services. Atkins said the exemptions would be designed to support firms that are willing to meet specified conditions while developing blockchain-based systems. These measures, he noted, would allow for responsible innovation within the boundaries of investor protection and market integrity. He also revealed that SEC staff have been directed to evaluate whether additional guidance or rule changes may be needed to help registrants interact with self-executing software systems in compliance with securities laws. “These on-chain self-executing software systems have proven to be resilient in the face of crises,” he said, contrasting them with centralized platforms that have failed under recent stress. “Many on-chain systems continued to operate as designed pursuant to open-source code.” You might also like: Crypto languished in ‘SEC limbo’ for years: Paul Atkins reaffirms crypto commitments Atkins emphasised that most securities regulations were built around traditional intermediaries such as broker-dealers and exchanges. “The drafters of these rules and regulations likely did not contemplate that self-executing software code might displace such issuers and intermediaries,” he noted, calling for regulatory flexibility to accommodate these new models. Atkins, appointed earlier this year as part of President Trump’s push to establish the U.S. as a global leader in crypto innovation, has called for a “rational regulatory framework” that balances innovation with investor protection. In contrast to his predecessor’s approach , Atkins is steering the SEC toward inclusive policymaking that recognises the operational differences between traditional financial intermediaries and decentralised systems. Since taking office, he has repeatedly stressed the need for structured, participatory rulemaking that reflects the unique characteristics of blockchain systems and crypto assets. The SEC’s Crypto Task Force, led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, is expected to release its first policy report in the coming months. The report will contribute to a regulatory foundation that Atkins says is urgently needed to support the growth of onchain technologies and provide long-awaited clarity for market participants.

Founder Charles Hoskinson has introduced the Cardinal Protocol, the network’s first DeFi solution powered by Bitcoin. For the first time, Bitcoin can now be used on Cardano for lending, staking, and more, without the need for third-party custodians. The news has sparked market excitement, pushing ADA’s 24-hour trading volume to $500 million. Currently trading at $0.669, Cardano is also gaining momentum after its inclusion in the Nasdaq crypto index, signaling growing institutional interest. Welcome to the first Bitcoin DeFi protocol developed for Cardano https://t.co/CoYvrYnIfI — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) June 9, 2025 Bitcoin Enters Cardano’s DeFi Arena Developed by InputOutput HK, Cardinal allows users to put their Bitcoin to work through lending, borrowing, farming, or staking on the Cardano blockchain. This is made possible using “wrapped UTXO” technology, which can be burned at any time to redeem the original Bitcoin or Ordinals. For the first time, Bitcoin holders have a way to tap into DeFi on Cardano without trusting centralized platforms. Safe, Cross-Chain, and Fully Transparent Instead of custodians, Cardinal uses a secure MuSig2 multi-signature system, making Bitcoin transactions safe, transparent, and decentralized. It also supports cross-chain compatibility with networks like Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche. Cardinal uses BitVMX for off-chain verification, while Cardano smart contracts handle the on-chain logic. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : 4 U.S. Economic Reports This Week That Could Make or Break Bitcoin , Users can now interact with popular DeFi platforms like MinswapDEX, SundaeSwap, and Fluid Tokens to lend, farm, and trade Bitcoin-backed assets.

2025-06-10T05:30:47,"Investors Pour $224M Into Crypto Funds, But Bitcoin’s Outflows Raise Eyebrows","Crypto asset investment products saw continued capital inflows last week, adding $224 million in net new money, according to the latest report from CoinShares. This marks the seventh consecutive week of positive flows, bringing the total to $11 billion during this period. Despite the headline inflows, investor sentiment appeared more cautious than in previous weeks. CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill noted that uncertainty around the US Federal Reserve’s next move on interest rates has introduced hesitation among crypto investors . With no clear signal yet on whether the Fed will pivot or hold rates steady, some capital remains sidelined, waiting for stronger macroeconomic cues. Ethereum Dominates Inflows While Bitcoin Sees Outflows Ethereum emerged as the week’s top performer in terms of fund flows , attracting $296.4 million in new investments. That brings its seven-week inflow total to approximately $1.5 billion, representing around 10.5% of total assets under management (AUM) across Ethereum-linked investment products. CoinShares described this as the most sustained period of inflows into Ethereum since the 2020 US election, suggesting a resurgence in investor confidence in the asset. In contrast, Bitcoin saw net outflows for the second week in a row, losing $56.5 million. The outflows were mirrored in short-Bitcoin products, which also recorded a second consecutive week of redemptions. This aligns with the broader theme of caution in the market, particularly with Bitcoin facing difficulty holding above the $105,000 level in recent sessions. The outflows may reflect traders rotating out of Bitcoin in favor of Ethereum or simply reducing overall exposure due to macro concerns . Digital asset inflows slow amid policy uncertainty, Ethereum leads Last week, digital asset investment products saw inflows totalling US$224M. @ethereum led with inflows of US$296.4M, while @Bitcoin saw outflows of US$56.5M. @SuiNetwork saw minor inflows of $1.1M, while $XRP … pic.twitter.com/6j2Aa2RuFl — CoinShares (@CoinSharesCo) June 9, 2025 Regional Activity and Altcoin Performance The United States led all regions in terms of net inflows, contributing $175 million to the total. Other notable contributors included Germany ($47.8 million), Switzerland ($15.7 million), Canada ($9.8 million), and Australia ($6.5 million). On the flip side, Brazil and Hong Kong registered outflows of $9.2 million and $14.6 million, respectively. The Hong Kong data is particularly notable, marking an end to the recent streak of record inflows driven by its newly launched spot crypto ETFs. Activity in the altcoin segment remained relatively muted. Sui logged a modest $1.1 million in inflows, while XRP continued its downward trend with $6.6 million in outflows, its third consecutive week in the red. While these movements are relatively small in dollar terms, they continue to reflect a general lack of conviction in altcoin markets during this consolidation phase.

2025-06-10T05:30:00,"BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Breaks Record as Meme Coin Funds Eye Approval","The crypto ETF market is rapidly evolving, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) setting a new industry record by surpassing $70 billion in assets under management in just 341 days. At the same time, analysts suggest that actively managed ETFs focused on meme coins such as Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe may be on the horizon, reflecting growing interest in retail-driven digital assets. BlackRock’s IBIT Becomes Fastest-Growing ETF in History as Assets Surpass $70 Billion According to Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas, the speed of IBIT’s ascent is unprecedented. “IBIT just blew through $70 billion and is now the fastest ETF to ever hit that mark in only 341 days, which is 5x faster than the old record held by GLD of 1,691 days,” Balchunas wrote in a June 9 post on X. The comparison to GLD—the SPDR Gold Shares ETF—is especially telling. Launched in 2004, GLD was one of the most influential commodity-based ETFs of its time and became a benchmark for alternative assets in traditional financial markets. IBIT has now surpassed that legacy in record time, underscoring the accelerating institutional adoption of Bitcoin as a legitimate and investable asset class. Dominating the Crypto ETF Landscape BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) was part of a wave of spot Bitcoin ETFs approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January 2024. While the initial greenlighting of multiple products ushered in fierce competition, it quickly became clear that BlackRock’s offering was capturing the lion’s share of investor demand. As of this week, IBIT manages over $70 billion in assets, more than double the AUM of its nearest competitor—Fidelity’s spot Bitcoin ETF—which currently sits at around $31 billion. That significant gap highlights BlackRock’s dominance in the space, driven by brand trust, distribution capabilities, and favorable market conditions for Bitcoin. The fund has also shown consistent investor appetite, recently enjoying an unbroken 34-day streak of net inflows. This performance not only signals sustained interest in Bitcoin but also affirms BlackRock’s execution in bringing a product to market that aligns with the long-term interests of both retail and institutional investors. IBIT’s explosive growth has mirrored Bitcoin’s resurgence in 2025, as the world’s leading cryptocurrency has seen a surge in demand following the fourth Bitcoin halving and continued concerns over fiat currency devaluation. The entry of a financial titan like BlackRock into the crypto arena has provided an additional layer of legitimacy to the digital asset sector, encouraging more traditional investors to gain exposure through regulated channels. Many analysts see IBIT’s trajectory as part of a broader structural shift in financial markets, where Bitcoin is increasingly viewed not just as a speculative asset, but as a viable component in diversified investment portfolios. The fund’s success may also accelerate similar offerings for other digital assets, potentially opening the door for Ethereum spot ETFs, or even niche products tied to Solana, Avalanche, or other blockchain ecosystems. Furthermore, the performance of IBIT is likely to be cited in future lobbying efforts aimed at pushing for clearer crypto regulations. Its success serves as empirical evidence that well-structured, transparent digital asset investment vehicles can thrive within the US financial system. Challenges and the Road Ahead Despite its meteoric rise, IBIT—and by extension, Bitcoin ETFs —still face regulatory and market-related headwinds. US regulators remain cautious about potential market manipulation, custody solutions, and systemic risks. Moreover, Bitcoin’s price volatility means that while inflows may be steady now, they could reverse sharply in the event of a significant downturn in crypto prices. Still, the success of IBIT is a powerful signal that investor demand for digital asset exposure is not a passing trend, but a long-term evolution in capital allocation. With BlackRock at the helm and an established distribution network spanning financial advisors, wealth managers, and institutional desks, IBIT appears well-positioned to continue its dominance. As Bitcoin continues to assert its role as a macro asset in the eyes of institutional investors, the precedent set by IBIT may serve as a roadmap for the next generation of digital financial products. Actively Managed Meme Coin ETFs May Be Closer Than You Think, Says Bloomberg Analyst In related news, according to Balchunas, there is a “really good chance” that a meme coin ETF will be launched in the near future—potentially as soon as 2026. In a June 7 post on X, Balchunas laid out his forecast, saying the market should first expect a series of actively managed crypto ETFs, which will likely be followed by one that specifically targets the volatile and fast-moving world of meme coins. Unlike traditional ETFs, which passively track a single asset or a fixed index, an actively managed meme coin ETF would take a dynamic approach. Such a fund would be curated and frequently rebalanced by a portfolio manager who makes real-time decisions about which tokens to buy, hold, or sell based on their performance and potential upside. This approach resonates with the fast-paced nature of the meme coin market, where trends and sentiment shift rapidly, and the next “hot” token can rise—or collapse—overnight. A team behind the Russia-themed Vladcoin meme coin advocated for exactly this structure, noting in a post that an ideal fund would ”hold the promising ones and sell off the weaker ones.” Retail-Driven Market With Growing Capitalization Meme coins have seen an explosion in popularity in 2025, largely fueled by a new wave of retail investors attracted by their viral potential, social media buzz, and extreme short-term gains. Tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), Bonk (BONK), and Trump ( TRUMP ) have become household names in the crypto community—despite their often thin technical use cases. At its peak earlier this year, the total market capitalization of meme coins surged past $60 billion, riding on speculative fervor and political memes. While the market has cooled since the January highs, the sector’s influence remains significant, especially among younger, digitally native traders. Meme coin market cap (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Still, any path toward an active meme coin ETF must first navigate regulatory approval—an area where the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has historically dragged its feet. Balchunas noted that most tokens must first be excluded from the 1933 Securities Act to be eligible for inclusion in an active ETF, making the regulatory structure a key bottleneck. Nevertheless, momentum is building. Several firms—including Grayscale, Bitwise, and 21Shares—have filed for spot Dogecoin ETFs in 2025. Smaller issuers like Osprey Funds and Rex Shares have submitted even bolder filings, aiming to list ETFs tracking TRUMP, BONK, and other politically or culturally charged tokens. “The Dogecoin ETF filing will tell us a lot,” said Balchunas, suggesting that DOGE may become the litmus test for broader meme coin ETF acceptance. While he previously estimated a 75% chance of SEC approval for a Dogecoin ETF this year, that optimism has waned. On blockchain-based prediction platform Polymarket, odds for such approval have dropped to 44% as of June. Boom, Bust, and the Next Wave The meme coin market has experienced dramatic whiplash in recent months. Following an epic bull run that peaked in January, many top tokens have seen their prices collapse by more than 70%. Dogecoin is down approximately 75% from its highs, while Shiba Inu has lost 85%. TRUMP, once boosted by claims of future acquisition by the Trump family-linked World Liberty Financial, is now down 86% from its all-time high. The sector’s volatility presents both risk and opportunity, precisely the kind of environment where an active fund could outperform. Rather than passively holding declining assets, an actively managed ETF could theoretically pivot quickly between outperformers and underperformers, preserving capital during downturns and riding momentum during rallies. More than 70 crypto ETF applications are still awaiting a decision from the SEC this year, according to Bloomberg data. While most of the attention has been on Bitcoin and Ethereum-based products, the potential emergence of meme coin ETFs adds an unpredictable but fascinating new layer to the evolving crypto investment landscape. For now, the idea of a meme coin ETF still feels slightly surreal—a far cry from the days when Bitcoin itself was dismissed as a “fraud” by mainstream finance. But if history is any guide, today’s internet joke could be tomorrow’s Wall Street product. And if market sentiment, social momentum, and ETF industry trends continue on their current trajectory, a memecoin ETF—especially an actively managed one—may soon become reality.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9503/black-rock-bitcoin-etf-breaks-record-as-meme-coin-funds-eye-approval,"BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|SHIB","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

Why? Because the company, led by Executive Chairman and co-founder Michael Saylor, has not only been buying up a massive amount of Bitcoin but also seems to be developing a new way to finance its crypto obsession, using what some might call a clever bit of financial engineering. In a Twitter post, Saylor sent the crypto community spinning with excitement. The post read: “Send More Orange.” Excited speculation in the Twitterverse besides, in the real world, what does it mean for MicroStrategy to send even more Bitcoin Orange way? MicroStrategy Bitcoin Accumulation Intensifies The most recent acquisition of Bitcoin by MicroStrategy occurred between May 26 and June 1, during which the company purchased 705 BTC for $75 million. Just one week earlier, the company had made an even larger buy of Bitcoin, adding 1,045 BTC worth $110.2 million to its balance sheet at an average price of $105,426 per coin. With these most recent additions, MicroStrategy now holds a total of 582,000 BTC, which have an approximate current market valuation of $62.7 billion. MicroStrategy( @Strategy ) bought another 1,045 $BTC ($110.2M) at an average price of $105,426 last week. #Strategy currently holds 582,000 $BTC ($62.7B), with an average buying price of $70,086 and an unrealized profit of $21.9B. https://t.co/319LQGdmJk pic.twitter.com/UufDG7BDV1 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 9, 2025 MicroStrategy stays fully committed to Bitcoin and buys more of it. The company’s average purchase price is $70,086 per BTC, giving it an unrealized profit of $21.9 billion on its over 150,000 BTC at present. With consistent, sizable purchases, it’s obvious MicroStrategy is not just in it for the short term but is betting big on Bitcoin’s future. The company’s Bitcoin treasury is almost 12 times larger than that of its nearest rival, Mara Holdings. It is also bigger than the total known amounts of Bitcoin in the United States and China, two countries that appear to control huge sums of Bitcoin by way of law enforcement and asset seizures. In the world of corporate Bitcoin adoption, MicroStrategy is by far the biggest player. $1 Billion Stock Offering Targets Institutional Backers Besides accelerating its purchases of Bitcoin, MicroStrategy has also been very busy attempting to raise fresh capital. The enterprise recently announced that it is offering up to $1 billion worth of stock. That number is a major jump from the $250 million stock raise it had initially guided us to expect. This time around, the company is raising the funds by issuing 11.76 million shares of a new security—the 10% Series A Perpetual Preferred Stock, which is priced at a very affordable $85 per share. CMC News: MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor posted, ""Send more Orange"" on X, typically signaling incoming $BTC acquisitions. The cryptic message follows the company's recent purchase of 705 $BTC for $75 million between May 26 and June 1. MicroStrategy now holds… pic.twitter.com/X1OjKLqQHa — CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) June 9, 2025 What makes this offering distinct from prior funding rounds is the kind of stock being offered. This preferred stock, unlike the convertible notes and debt instruments the company has previously pushed, pays a non-cumulative 10 percent annual dividend. That move looks designed to attract institutional investors who want stable returns but without the kind of direct exposure to Bitcoin that other instruments the company has issued have. Instead of traditional debt, MicroStrategy now offers preferred shares. This reduces the pressure to make bond repayments and pay interest on those bonds. It also avoids the dilution risk associated with convertible bonds. This is a strategic shift that reflects the company’s growing maturity in how it funds its crypto-centric operations. It also makes the company much more appealing to risk-averse institutional capital. Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin Vision Remains Unshaken Since the first major acquisition of Bitcoin in 2020, Michael Saylor has consistently and vocally pro-Bitcoin. When he posted “Send more Orange” on X, the Bitcoin community took it immediately as another message urging for more Bitcoin purchases. Saylor has only ever used “orange” as a Bitcoin rallying cry a single time. And yet, for that reason alone, I cannot quite fathom trying to use “orange” as a substitute. It is also noteworthy that Saylor’s recent missive, far from exceeding the excitement provoked by earlier instances of ordering Bitcoin in bulk, is at least arguably less exciting than some of the past proclamations or directives. MicroStrategy, under Saylor’s guidance, has metamorphosed from a conventional software business into a powerful force in the digital asset domain. Its change in direction seems more than just a pivot into a hot new area. It appears to reflect Saylor’s and the company’s deep conviction that Bitcoin isn’t just a hedge against inflation but a far better store of value than whatever you may have in the way of fiat currency or traditional financial assets. Even though Bitcoin is a highly unstable asset class, MicroStrategy’s excellent position—complete with sizable unrealized gains and a well-laid capital plan—gives the company a strong financial cushion. Saylor treats Bitcoin as digital real estate, not as a kind of digital monkey business. He believes that more and more institutional investors are taking this same long view. Conclusion MicroStrategy’s recent activities, from purchasing massive amounts of Bitcoin to bringing forth a fresh $1 billion preferred stock offering, only serve to emphasize the company’s nearly fanatical devotion to Bitcoin and, more broadly, the whole digital asset space. And why not? With 582,000 BTC now stacked in its treasury and a looking-ahead-to-the-next-move capital strategy aimed squarely at institutional investors, MicroStrategy under the continued stewardship of its co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor seems to be, if not quite leading the charge, then at least shuffling to the front of the Bitcoin corporate adoption narrative.

2025-06-10T05:00:46,"Bitcoin On-Chain Warning: Short-Term Holder Selling Accelerates Amid Price Correction","As Bitcoin (BTC) came close to slumping below the psychologically important $100,000 mark last week, the short-term holders (STH) cohort started to show signs of weakening conviction in the leading cryptocurrency, raising fears of a deeper price correction. Bitcoin STH Fear Resurfaces According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Darkfost, Bitcoin STH’s net position has turned sharply negative over the past month. This has happened despite BTC holding above the $100,000 level. For the uninitiated, Bitcoin STH are investors who have held their BTC for less than 155 days. They are generally more reactive to price volatility and market sentiment, often selling during corrections or uncertainty. Specifically, a cumulative net position change of -833,000 BTC has been recorded among short-term holders during the ongoing pullback. By comparison, the April crash saw a net position change of around -977,000 BTC. Related Reading: Bitcoin Signals Strength As Long-Term Holder Realized Cap Surges Past $20 Billion – Details Darkfost noted that current STH behavior closely resembles the activity observed during BTC’s brief drop below $80,000 in April 2025, when the digital asset bottomed out at $74,508. The analyst wrote: Since then, STH appear to have become much more sensitive to market movements, and the recent dip around the $100,000 mark was enough to trigger renewed fear among this group of investors. BTC Showing Signs of Reversal Although BTC lost momentum after reaching its latest all-time high (ATH) of $111,814, the leading cryptocurrency regained strength over the weekend – indicating a possible reversal may be underway. Related Reading: Bitcoin Derivatives Reset: Neutral Funding And Whale Withdrawals Hint At Bullish Shift For example, seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that BTC has broken through the key resistance level at $106,600. In a recent X post, Martinez predicted that Bitcoin could rally to $108,300 or even $110,000 if current momentum continues. In a separate X post, fellow crypto analyst Rekt Capital shared the following Bitcoin daily chart, noting that the cryptocurrency not only broke out of its two-week downtrend – highlighted in light blue – but may now be turning that former resistance into a new support level. Meanwhile, several technical indicators also point to continued bullish momentum. Notably, Bitcoin’s Hash Ribbons have recently flashed a prime buying signal. Additionally, on-chain data suggests that BTC could experience a sharp upward move in the short term, potentially driven by a negative funding rate on Binance. A prolonged period of negative funding rates often sets the stage for a short squeeze. Despite the bullish outlook, some red flags remain. Recent data shows that long-term holders are gradually exiting the market, while an influx of retail investors could add volatility to the current rally. At press time, BTC trades at $107,627, up 1.9% in the past 24 hours.

2025-06-10T04:59:53,"$AVL Token Soars 21% After Major Burn: Avalon Labs Reshapes Its Ecosystem","In a sensational shift that rocked the crypto markets, Avalon Labs’ home token, $AVL , blasted off and shot up 21% following the declaration of a colossal token melt. The blockchain-borne financial services platform assured us that it had eternally deleted 80 million $AVL tokens from nature’s circulating supply, and the crypto community seems to have taken this as a sign that confidence and interest in the project has renewed. The whole thing looks like savagely good optics for Avalon. Avalon Labs has announced the burn of 80 million AVL tokens, representing approximately 44% of the circulating supply. The burned tokens primarily came from unclaimed allocations in an earlier airdrop campaign. Launched in March 2024, the campaign saw a total of $20 million worth… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 9, 2025 The incineration, which affects a jaw-dropping 44% of the total circulating supply of $AVL, was mainly made up of unclaimed tokens from a past airdrop. At the time of the incineration, these tokens were worth about 16 million dollars and were obliterated, signaling a clear move toward deflationary tokenomics in the Avalon ecosystem. Token Burn Signals a Deflationary Pivot Avalon Labs’ recent token burn is something more than a mere technical update; it’s a bold, strategic move that positions us for a deflationary future. Token burns reduce the total supply of a cryptocurrency, often increasing its scarcity, which, when there is still demand for the asset, increases its price. Avalon Labs has officially burned 80M $AVL , representing 44% of the circulating supply. These unclaimed airdrop tokens, worth approximately $16 million, have now been permanently removed from circulation. Over the past year, a total of $20M worth of $AVL has been claimed by… pic.twitter.com/GXMWKpmbNF — Avalon Labs (@avalonfinance_) June 9, 2025 Avalon Labs has hugely curtailed the supply of the token, with 80 million tokens now permanently excised from circulation. This event marks the start of a deflationary cycle for $AVL—one that is supposed to deliver long-term, unlocked value for holders and even better incentive alignment across the ecosystem. The market seemed to like the move, with the token popping 21% almost immediately after the announcement. The burn also serves to clean up the token’s ledger by eliminating dormant or unclaimed tokens, many of which were leftover from Avalon’s initial airdrop campaign. Avalon Labs: Bridging Bitcoin with Modern Finance Avalon Labs sees itself as something quite different: a next-generation financial services platform, built on the Bitcoin network. Whereas Ethereum and other blockchains often grab the headlines in the growing world of decentralized finance (DeFi), Avalon is carving out a unique position, a “niche” in its own words, in the development of a Bitcoin-based financial services platform. Of late, Avalon Labs has finished a round of strategic funding, and for this, it was YZi Labs who took the lead. Avalon now boasts not only a substantially beefed-up balance sheet but also significant momentum on the operational and developmental fronts, too. It hopes to use its new cash to widen its user inroad and to go to market with several Bitcoin-native financial products. The firm insists that what it’s really after in all these machinations is the construction of a robust ecosystem where those who hold the Avalon token are rewarded for something much better than what 2018 promised: long-term participation instead of short-term flipping. The recent Avalon burn, in effect, updates the tokenomics so the remainders are no longer dead weight. Investor Sentiment Turns Bullish Since the token was burned, the feeling in the $AVL around has changed. The $AVL isn’t burnt, sentiment in the crypto community is definitely good. What is Avalon Labs doing? They are taking bold action with the $AVL. Why is that? Because they are doing what many other projects in the space are not doing. They are combating oversupply and inflationary pressures, and they are doing it in the most straightforward way imaginable. Avalon Labs is at a key moment, and so is the cryptocurrency industry. This industry faces rising scrutiny over the real-world usefulness of its tokens and the viability of its growth models. With the appearance of mechanics that promise a declining supply of its tokens, and the backing of some serious institutional investors like YZi Labs, Avalon seems well set to ride out the market’s ups and downs and establish itself as a credible player. Yet, at the same time, the scrutiny seems likely to increase. The impact of this burn may go beyond merely moving the price. It’s a signal to both existing and would-be investors that Avalon Labs isn’t kidding around. They’ve got a serious, unfussy, value-driven program that lays down a path for long-term growth. Once this week’s action-packed market reshuffle settles, one thing stands out: Avalon Labs’ $AVL token is no longer just an obscure under-the-radar play.

2025-06-10T04:48:57,"Signs of Accumulation Emerge as Bitcoin (BTC) Shipped to $110K","Bitcoin broke above $107,000 on Monday in a notable respite and kept climbing to $110,500 on Tuesday morning, following last week’s turbulence sparked by the Trump-Musk fallout. The latest on-chain data now suggests that the crypto asset may be preparing for its next upward move, as several key indicators reflect growing bullish sentiment. Bitcoin Demand Strengthens According to CryptoQuant’s latest update , one of the primary signals comes from Binance’s Taker Buy/Sell Ratio, a metric that measures the volume of market buy orders relative to market sell orders. The metric has recently surged to 1.1, which means that traders on Binance are showing significantly more buying aggression than selling. Historically, values above 1 tend to reflect a shift toward increased demand and bullish market behavior. Another supportive indicator is the 90-day Buy/Sell Pressure Delta, which is climbing toward previous historical peaks of around 0.02. This delta represents the net accumulation behavior across the market. Although the current level is not yet excessive, it suggests sustained accumulation without signs of overheating. This environment could be conducive to gradual price expansion. Re-Accumulation Phase Bitcoin’s price has broken above the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) 1-day to 1-week band. This band tracks coins moved within the last week, and its breakout indicates that newer coins are now in profit and are being held rather than sold off. Such breakouts have previously preceded transitions from distribution to re-accumulation phases, and often indicated that a newer cohort of investors is entering the market with strong holding conviction. Further validating this narrative is the rise in the Realized Cap held by long-term holders (LTH), which has now surpassed $56 billion. This suggests that coins are increasingly moving into wallets that have historically held assets for over 155 days, which reflects a general lack of intent to sell. These wallets tend to represent “smart money” that accumulates rather than exits during bullish phases. Considering all these factors together, the data reflects a market that is neither in euphoria nor fear, but showing clear signs of strengthening fundamentals and increasing investor confidence, which could point to the possibility of Bitcoin’s next leg higher, despite June jitters .

2025-06-10T04:48:48,"Bitcoin Rebounds to $108K as Short Squeeze and FOMO Drive Monday Surge","The renewed energy in the markets at the week’s start has carried over nicely into the cryptocurrency space, with Bitcoin—BTC —making a dramatic return to the $108,000 level as we now head toward the weekend. Just four days ago, BTC was on the edge of dipping below the less-than-psychological $100,000 threshold. Retail traders in the space had been FOMOing heavily into Bitcoin, which had pushed its price so high that some were starting to call it a bubble. Panic selling in these same retail traders pulled the market downward, but now we are back on the way up. The price of Bitcoin surged from 105,000 dollars to 107,000 in a matter of hours on Monday, before further increasing to touch 108,000 dollars. The move, of course, came as a pleasant surprise to holders, but it was also something of a relief to soured market sentiment, which, only weeks earlier, had taken the nascent industry to new depths of despair. Monday’s surge led some observers to hypothesize about the return of a bull market, even if others pointed wryly to the nature of Bitcoin’s recent trading and the kinds of things that are often said before a major price drop. Monday has kicked off with a bang for crypto traders, as Bitcoin has quickly returned to $108K. After threatening to fall below $100K just 4 days ago, retail traders panic sold. Now, they are showing signs of flooding back in with the 2nd largest spike in FOMO in the past 2… pic.twitter.com/ZlPvHy8CGg — Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 9, 2025 Short Liquidations Spark Rally The most recent surge in the market seems to have been generated by overzealous short sellers being forced to cover their positions. One measurable effect of this was seen between 1 and 5 PM, on a Monday afternoon, when total liquidations of short positions jumped from $105,000 to $359,000. Rising prices were clearly doing their job, but it is also possible that some market orders had hit certain key price levels, generating an uptick in price behavior that even more short sellers wanted to stay away from. All in all, something like $250 million worth of short positions were liquidated during this time. $BTC jumped from $105K to $107K today – likely fuelled by a wave of short liquidations. Over just 4 hours, total short liquidations spiked from $105K to $359K (24H SMA). Last week’s negative funding rates had pointed to rising short appetite, and today, those bets got squeezed. pic.twitter.com/TMkdyXjOUZ — glassnode (@glassnode) June 9, 2025 In the week leading up to today, the funding rates across the main derivatives exchanges swung negative and maintained that position. This was a clear signal that traders were heavily shorting Bitcoin. And when a trading environment is heavily short, it becomes increasingly ripe for a short squeeze, which is when the price unexpectedly moves upward and forces traders who are short (betting that the price will go down) to the buy side in order to cover their now losing position. Although rapid upward price spikes can result from a short squeeze, they are not necessarily long-lasting. Traders now must watch for sustained follow-through volume and for new buying pressure—especially from institutional investors—to step in and support these elevated price levels. Retail Sentiment Turns Euphoric Once Again Retail-driven enthusiasm is surging again, as seen on social media where the FOMO meter is registering its second-largest spike in the past two weeks. This is bringing previously sidelined retail investors back into the market. It is almost hard to believe after the plunge seen just days ago when Bitcoin was at a sub-$100,000 breakdown level, but this enthusiasm is the real deal. In the past, Bitcoin has had a tendency to move in the opposite direction of extreme retail sentiment. When FOMO (fear of missing out) reaches its highest levels, it coincides with local tops for Bitcoin. Likewise, when the crowd is in a state of capitulation (when everyone is throwing in the towel), it has frequently marked a bottom for Bitcoin. This sentiment dynamic is particularly intense in crypto, where price action is often driven by psychological and behavioral patterns. Particularly, social media has turned out to be a counter-indicator of sorts. When it is retail traders who are dominating the platforms, it is also the same time that experienced market participants are reducing their exposure. Given the intensity of today’s surge in retail sentiment, the next 24-48 hours should tell us a lot about the duration and sustainability of this current rally. #Bitcoin spot ETFs saw net outflows of -4.6K $BTC last week – first negative week in 8. Total holdings are now 1.20M #BTC , down ~11.5K #BTC from the late-May peak.

Last week, Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced net outflows of 4,600 BTC; that marks the first negative week for ETFs in eight. Total ETF holdings now stand at approximately 1.20 million BTC. They are down roughly 11,500 BTC from their peak in late May.

Signs of renewed ETF inflows would be clear evidence of continued institutional interest and, we think, could act as a strong confirmation of the more than just technically squeezed recent rally. At present, the market is experiencing a degree of optimism because of Monday’s rebound.

2025-06-10T04:46:59,"Ethereum ETFs Draw Nearly $843M in Inflows as Institutional Momentum Builds","Ethereum is once more under the market’s focus and the crypto spotlight. It seems to be back. And it’s not just Bitcoin . Traditional finance investing and capital is flowing into Ethereum as well. The last four weeks alone have seen American spot ETFs for Ethereum receive $842.9 million in new capital. With fidelity from spiritual-quality companies like BlackRock and Fidelity, the Ethereum capital inflow seems not just steady but increasing. From April 9 to now, ETH has gained ~69%, easily pushing through several layers of resistance and renewing investor optimism about a fresh macro rally. $ETH ETF INFLOWS DON'T LIE In just 4 weeks, U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs have seen $842.9M in net inflows, a tidal wave of institutional capital that’s helping push ETH up 69% since April 9th! Big money is here, and they’re not just dipping their toes, they’re diving in.… pic.twitter.com/XNelyZCvuz — ethereum.network (@EthereumNetw) June 9, 2025 Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum is moving toward not just institutional but regulatory demand for what is becoming a more critically accepted layer of digital infrastructure. Near-future economic models for Ethereum are projected to be a lot healthier. Scalable platform means no congestion in the system regardless of volume of transactions, and that no systematic collapse of fees. Above all, Dapp (decentralized App) leads to DTV (decentralized transaction vehicle)/DTP (decentralized trading platform). No collapse model means anything from three-fifths to six-tenths of ETH hitting the market as profits over the next 36 months. And the Dapp takes further advantage of the Ethereum blockchain. Wall Street Goes All-In: Ethereum ETF Inflows Paint a Bullish Picture Over the past month, the spot Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. have seen astonishing inflows that very clearly indicate the growing confidence of structures in the Ethereum network as a solid investment vehicle. These investment structures have now pulled in nearly $843 million. That’s coming from vehicles that only exist because the SEC has finally pulled its head out of the sand and approved them after many, many months of seemingly endless regulatory scrutiny. This seems to be a strategic rather than a speculative investment. Institutional investors aren’t chasing after short-term profits like retail investors; they’re taking positions for the long haul. This isn’t a temporary upsurge in interest; it’s a deliberate move. For a number of institutional investors, Ethereum is a lot more than a cryptocurrency: it’s the infrastructure the decentralized future is being built on, with applications in finance, identity, and gaming, not to mention the real-world assets that humanity plays around with. The recent influx of interest from institutions is also being given a lot of the fresh credit for ETH’s recent price movement. Since early April, Ethereum has soared nearly 70%, a rally that pretty much coincides with the incoming ETF inflow trend. This participation and the capital size really involved suggest that Ethereum is no longer living only in the native crypto neighborhood. It’s now part of the broader financial world. Ethereum L2 transaction fees are rapidly declining. In the last 30 days: •⁠ ⁠Base: 66 $ETH (-34,8%) •⁠ ⁠⁠World Chain: 33 $ETH (-64,5%) •⁠ ⁠Arbitrum: 20 $ETH (-84,5%) •⁠ ⁠OP: 12 $ETH (-68,5%) •⁠ ⁠Polygon: 7,5 $ETH (-78,6%) Fees are trending toward zero.… pic.twitter.com/iddTtMMEo7 — Ted (@TedPillows) June 9, 2025 Ethereum Layer 2s Slash Fees, Reinforcing Long-Term Utility Even though mainstream adoption brings external affirmation, the real reason to be excited about Ethereum is how incredibly well it works as a piece of technology. Take the Layer 2 “rollup” networks that sit on top of Ethereum and promise to scale it. To give an idea of how far we have come, over the course of December and January, the costs to users for operating their rollup networks went down by an average of 300%. That is absolutely insane. And again, it is not something that went down by 50% over a couple of weeks and we all hope it comes back up. This went down by 300% and is something that we expect to happen again, in a well-mapped-out, planned, and in many cases, already implemented way. More on this in a bit. Over the past month, quite a few prominent Layer-2 chains registered some substantial reductions in Ethereum fees. To be precise, the following five, which are some of the biggest L2 chains, reported the following reductions: – Base: Recorded 66 ETH in fees, down 34.8%. – World Layer: Reported 33 ETH in fees, down 64.5%. – Arbitrum: Registered a much more substantial reduction with fees falling to 20 ETH, marking an 84.5% drop since last month. – Optimism: Reported a smaller, but still notable, reduction ending up with 12 ETH in fees, down 68.5%. – Polygon: Registered 7.5 ETH in fees, down 78.6%. This data makes one thing very clear—transaction costs across the ecosystem are falling. And they are falling fast, not by chance but by design. Ethereum’s roadmap gives pride of place to not just scalability but also efficiency, and the reduction in fees we’re seeing now seems to point to the growing effectiveness of that strategy. You could argue that as fees decrease, the yield rises on the usability of the network. And increased usability (which must also not come at the cost of security) is a gateway to Ethereum’s interaction with the masses. Ethereum is becoming cost-effective. It is becoming accessible. It is becoming useful. And like any infrastructure, those three things are absolutely vital if you want people to build on top of/within said infrastructure. Is This the Beginning of Ethereum’s Next Macro Rally? With a combination of price and fundamental momentum, Ethereum seems to be at the early stages of the next major market cycle. The forces of both institutional capital and tech are consolidating and fusing around the asset. Like a train coming into the station, Ethereum is regaining not only its market position but also new legitimacy as an asset class. We see not only tech but also established financial institutions rallying around ETH. What sets this rally apart from the previous ones is its foundation. Instead of being propelled mainly by retail speculation, the present rise of Ethereum is supported by long-term investment, structural enhancements, and a future in which Ethereum is likely to be scalable. The coming together of lower fees, a surge in ETF demand, and infrastructure upgrades points toward an Ethereum ecosystem that seems more mature and resilient. Should Ethereum persist as scalable and cost-efficient infrastructure, attracting more and more institutional investment, this might be more than just a run-up. It might well be a foundational chapter in the ongoing story of Ethereum as a next-generation global economic layer. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Behind this latest rally is a mix trading activity, on-chain signals, and macro developments. According to Coinglass data , nearly $203 million in positions were liquidated in the Bitcoin market over the past day. Of that, $195 million were shorts, highlighting the strength of upward momentum. Meanwhile, derivatives volume more than doubled, rising 113% to $110.63 billion. Open interest also grew by 7.3% to $76.6 billion, showing fresh capital entering the market as traders repositioned. A key external driver appears to be easing tensions between the U.S. and China. Trade negotiations resumed in London on June 9, with hopes of a deal that could reduce tariffs and lighten export restrictions. Market sentiment improved as talks got underway, which raised demand for riskier assets like Bitcoin. But beyond the headlines, the real story may lie in what’s happening on-chain. According to a June 10 post by CryptoQuant contributor BaykusCharts, Bitcoin reserves on centralized exchanges have dropped from 1.55 million in July 2024 to just 1.01 million BTC today. That’s a reduction of 550,000 coins in under a year. You might also like: https://crypto.news/interview-bitcoin-price-target-hinges-on-fed-pivot-and-etf-flows-bitunix-analyst/ This kind of steady withdrawal indicates long-term holding. As more Bitcoin leaves exchanges, available supply shrinks. If demand rises at the same time, as it appears to be, prices typically move up. The pattern is consistent with the notion that Bitcoin is no longer viewed as a trading asset but as digital gold. Further data indicates that U.S. investors’ demand is increasing. The “Coinbase Premium” indicator from CryptoQuant shows that Americans are paying more to purchase Bitcoin, a pattern frequently observed during the accumulation stages. Whale activity is also increasing, according to Santiment, with renewed accumulation seen across wallet sizes, especially among those holding between 10 and 100 BTC. There remains some caution though. Bitcoin is still correlated to the larger equity market, which could limit short-term gains if macro headwinds reappear. Furthermore, traders cite futures data as evidence that not everyone is certain of a breakout. Rather than long-term conviction, short-term speculation or hedging may have contributed significantly to the recent volume. Traders are still placing bets in both directions and while liquidations heavily leaned against shorts, such volatility often indicates indecision . In these conditions, it only takes a modest reversal or macro shock to shake weak hands out of the market. Even so, the mood is turning optimistic. Many analysts are already calling for new all-time highs in the coming days, some even eyeing $150,000 by the end of , especially if U.S. debt levels keep climbing.

2025-06-10T04:18:14,"UK Insolvency Service Appoints First Crypto Specialist – What This Means for BTC Seizures","The UK Insolvency Service on Monday named its first crypto intelligence specialist , marking a major step in the government’s efforts to trace and recover digital assets such as Bitcoin from bankrupt individuals and criminal cases. Andrew Small, a former economic crime investigator with the police, will lead the charge as crypto ownership becomes increasingly common in insolvency proceedings. His appointment reflects a sharp rise in the number and value of crypto-related cases over the past five years. In 2024–25, the agency identified over £520,000 (about $660,000) worth of crypto assets across 59 insolvency cases, up from just £1,436 (around $1,820) in 14 cases in 2019–20. Insolvencies with crypto as asset up 420% in 5 years Over £500,000 crypto in insolvency cases last year Ex-police investigator appointed to trace digital assets in criminal cases Insolvency Service hires first crypto expert to help recover funds from bankruptcy cases — Insolvency Service (@insolvencygovuk) June 9, 2025 Rising Crypto Ownership Forces UK to Bolster Asset Recovery Capabilities The move follows growing concerns about hidden or difficult-to-trace wealth in insolvency and enforcement work. With more than 7m UK adults now holding some form of cryptocurrency , according to the Financial Conduct Authority, digital assets are becoming a key part of the personal finance landscape. As a result, they are also showing up more frequently in bankruptcy and fraud investigations. Small will operate within the Insolvency Service’s Investigation and Enforcement Services team, focusing primarily on criminal cases. He is expected to provide frontline investigators with technical guidance on how digital assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and NFTs are stored, traded, and concealed. “There has been a rapid rise in crypto ownership in the UK, and alongside that, we’ve seen a similar rise in cryptoasset ownership in bankruptcy cases,” said Small. “My role will help the agency by providing specialist knowledge about the types of cryptoassets available and the associated technology used to buy, sell and store them.” New Crypto Role Aims to Close Gaps in UK Asset Recovery Framework The appointment is expected to have a significant impact on crypto seizures, particularly Bitcoin. As the agency strengthens its ability to detect and recover digital assets, individuals and companies facing insolvency or criminal investigations will find it increasingly difficult to hide wealth in cryptocurrencies. For those attempting to use crypto as a shield, the risks of detection and seizure are now markedly higher. Officials say the new role is a critical part of returning more value to creditors. The agency’s expanding mandate includes tracing assets, as well as recovering them on behalf of creditors. Neil Freebury, head of intelligence at the Insolvency Service, said the growing complexity of asset holdings made it essential to bring in experts. “Andrew brings a wealth of knowledge to this role,” he noted, adding that his background would strengthen the agency’s ability to deal with crypto-heavy cases. The appointment signals a more aggressive and informed approach to digital asset enforcement in the UK, at a time when regulators and courts globally are grappling with the challenges of decentralized finance.

Since 2022, it has formed through real-world use cases, not speculation, as Pioneers exchanged goods and services using PiCoin in a closed-loop economy. It reflects a community-agreed value rather than market prices listed on centralized exchanges . Crypto advocates, including @gfc199 and others, argue that this bottom-up value model is what kept the project alive during years of development. The Numbers Behind the Concern According to the analyst, most Pioneers hold fewer than 300 PiCoin. With exchange prices hovering around just $0.63, this means their holdings are valued at less than $200, far from the life-changing potential many had envisioned. The fear now is that if the Core Team remains silent on GCV or continues to delay its recognition, Pioneers may lose faith entirely. This could trigger a mass sell-off and further disconnect from the network. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why is The Crypto Market Going Up Today? , A Call to Action Before It’s Too Late The upcoming Pi Day 2 celebration could serve as a key inflection point for Pi cryptocurrency.

2025-06-10T03:52:26,"BIP177 và cuộc tranh cãi về cái tên Bitcoin?","Cuộc tranh luận lâu năm về việc đặt tên gọi Bitcoin cho số đơn vị sau dấu thập phân phần nào phản ánh mâu thuẫn giữa truyền thống và tính tiện dụng của Bitcoin trong đời sống. Một đề xuất nổi bật là loại bỏ dấu thập phân và dùng “bitcoin” (số nhiều) làm đơn vị nhỏ nhất thay vì satoshi. Dù satoshi đã trở nên phổ biến, một số người cho rằng “bit” – bằng 100 satoshi – sẽ thân thiện hơn với người dùng đại chúng, đặc biệt khi giá Bitcoin tăng cao. Gần đây, BIP 177 – do John Carvalho (CEO Synonym) đề xuất – đã làm nóng cuộc tranh luận. BIP 177 muốn bỏ hoàn toàn dấu thập phân và dùng “bitcoin” làm đơn vị hiển thị mặc định. Tuy nhiên, giống như các nâng cấp trước đó như SegWit hay Taproot, sự thay đổi này đòi hỏi thời gian dài thảo luận, thử nghiệm và sự đồng thuận từ cộng đồng. Thành công của BIP 177 phụ thuộc không chỉ vào chất lượng kỹ thuật mà còn vào mức độ sẵn sàng thay đổi của cộng đồng Bitcoin. Sau 16 năm, tại sao vẫn tranh luận về tên đơn vị nhỏ nhất của BTC? Bitcoin, với tư cách là tài sản kỹ thuật số, có thể chia nhỏ thành những đơn vị cực kỳ bé để hỗ trợ nhiều loại hoạt động kinh tế, từ các giao dịch giá trị cao đến các microtransaction. Đơn vị nổi tiếng nhất chính là “satoshi,” đại diện cho 1/100.000.000 của một bitcoin. Thuật ngữ “satoshi” lần đầu tiên được đề xuất trên diễn đàn Bitcointalk.org năm 2010 bởi một người dùng có nickname Ribuck, người cũng gợi ý tên gọi “austrian” để tôn vinh Trường phái Kinh tế Áo. Theo thời gian, cộng đồng đã chọn “satoshi” làm đơn vị nguyên tử của Bitcoin, vừa để vinh danh người sáng lập bí ẩn Satoshi Nakamoto, vừa tạo ra một ngôn ngữ văn hóa ngắn gọn như “stacking sats.” Tuy nhiên, một đơn vị khác – “bit,” tương đương với 100 satoshis hoặc 1/1.000.000 của một bitcoin – cũng từng được đề xuất vì tính trực quan hơn. Một số giọng nói nổi bật như Adam Back đã ủng hộ việc hồi sinh “bits,” lý luận rằng nếu giá Bitcoin đạt mức 1 triệu đô la, thì 1 bit sẽ bằng 1 đô la, giúp việc chuyển đổi dễ dàng hơn. Như vậy, cuộc tranh luận giữa “sats” và “bits” không chỉ là vấn đề kỹ thuật mà còn là câu chuyện giữa truyền thống và thiết kế thân thiện với người dùng. Hiện tại, Bitcoin có nhiều đơn vị khác nhau: BTC, mBTC (millibitcoin), µBTC (microbitcoin hoặc “bits”), và satoshis. Điều này có thể gây nhầm lẫn, đặc biệt với những người không chuyên về công nghệ. Một bitcoin (1 BTC) bằng 1.000 mBTC, 1.000.000 bits, hoặc 100.000.000 satoshis. Sự đa dạng này tạo ra độ phức tạp không cần thiết, đặc biệt khi người dùng phải đối mặt với các con số nhỏ như 0.000043 BTC hoặc 4300 satoshis. Theo BIP 177, một bitcoin đầy đủ – tức 100 triệu satoshis – có thể được gọi là “Mega Bitcoin.” Việc loại bỏ dấu thập phân và chuẩn hóa đơn vị thành “bitcoins” sẽ giúp giảm bớt cảm giác xa lạ và kỹ thuật hóa, mang lại cảm giác gần gũi hơn với người dùng phổ thông. BIP 177 , do CEO Synonym John Carvalho đề xuất, nhằm mục đích thay đổi cách hiểu thông thường về đơn vị Bitcoin bằng cách sử dụng đơn vị nhỏ nhất (đơn vị nguyên tố) làm tiêu chuẩn hiển thị. Thay vì biểu diễn giá trị Bitcoin dưới dạng thập phân (ví dụ: 0.00004321 BTC), BIP 177 khuyến nghị loại bỏ hoàn toàn dấu thập phân và gọi mỗi đơn vị cơ bản là “1 bitcoin.” Với mô hình này, điều từng được gọi là “1 satoshi” (1/100.000.000 BTC) giờ đây sẽ đơn giản là “1 bitcoin.” Các nhà ủng hộ cho rằng hệ thập phân là di sản UI lỗi thời gây nhầm lẫn, đặc biệt với những người mới tham gia. Mặc dù BIP 177 không thay đổi quy tắc đồng thuận hay dữ liệu trên chuỗi, nhưng nó yêu cầu một sự thay đổi đồng bộ trong giao diện ví và sàn giao dịch, đồng thời đối mặt với thách thức văn hóa khi phải thay thế thuật ngữ “sats” đã ăn sâu bén rễ. Bitkit Wallet là ví đầu tiên áp dụng BIP 177 Bitkit Wallet, phát triển bởi Synonym – một công ty “chị em” của Bitfinex – là ví tự quản lý tập trung vào trải nghiệm người dùng thân thiện, giúp mọi người dễ dàng gia nhập hệ sinh thái Bitcoin. Bitkit tích hợp nhiều tính năng tiên tiến như nút Lightning tích hợp sẵn, thanh toán qua định danh phi tập trung (DIDs), và sao lưu mượt mà qua đám mây mã hóa. Điều khiến Bitkit nổi bật là việc áp dụng sớm và nhiệt tình tiêu chuẩn BIP 177. Thay vì sử dụng BTC hoặc các phân số phức tạp như mBTC, ví Bitkit hiển thị giá trị theo “bitcoins,” giúp người dùng dễ hiểu hơn. Ví dụ, thay vì hiển thị “0.000043 BTC,” Bitkit sẽ hiển thị “43 bitcoins.” Điều này biến Bitcoin từ một loại tiền tệ kỹ thuật khó hiểu thành một phương tiện trao đổi quen thuộc, giống như cách chúng ta sử dụng xu hoặc satoshi. Liệu BIP 177 có nhận được sự ủng hộ đủ lớn để tồn tại lâu dài? Hiện chưa rõ BIP 177 có được cộng đồng chấp nhận rộng rãi hay không, dù đã có một số công ty như Square của Jack Dorsey bắt đầu áp dụng. Các ví và sàn lớn vẫn ưu tiên BTC hay satoshi, cho thấy xu hướng bảo thủ trong cộng đồng Bitcoin. Nhìn lại lịch sử, những thay đổi dù có lợi rõ ràng về mặt kỹ thuật như SegWit ( BIP 141 ) hay Taproot ( BIP 341 ) cũng phải mất vài năm mới được chấp nhận. SegWit chẳng hạn, được đề xuất từ 2015 nhưng đến tận 2017 mới được kích hoạt, sau hàng loạt tranh luận và một cuộc nội chiến trong cộng đồng, gồm cả UASF và các cuộc chạy đua giữa thợ đào. Quá trình thay đổi tiêu chuẩn đã định hình luôn khó khăn, đặc biệt khi liên quan đến giao diện người dùng. Nhiều người dùng và lập trình viên không muốn thay đổi thói quen, dù đề xuất có lợi về mặt trải nghiệm. Thiếu sự phối hợp từ các bên lớn như ví, nền tảng thanh toán, giáo dục – BIP 177 có nguy cơ chỉ dừng lại ở ý tưởng tốt nhưng không được triển khai. Trong hệ sinh thái Bitcoin, BIP là những đề xuất cải tiến – từ giao thức đến giao diện. Một số BIP cần đồng thuận toàn mạng (ví dụ SegWit hay Taproot), còn BIP 177 thuộc dạng tự nguyện áp dụng. Nhưng kể cả vậy, mọi thay đổi có ý nghĩa đều phải vượt qua cộng đồng phân mảnh, thận trọng và hoài nghi. Vấn đề nằm ở cách vận hành của cộng đồng Bitcoin: phi tập trung, cẩn trọng và không ai có quyền ra lệnh thay đổi. BIP 177 là thay đổi không cần đồng thuận toàn mạng, nhưng vẫn phải dựa vào sự tự nguyện của các nhà phát triển và dịch vụ. Khi 1 satoshi dần tiệm cận giá trị 1 đô, cách hiển thị trực quan hơn như BIP 177 (dùng “bit”) có thể giúp giao dịch hàng ngày dễ hiểu hơn. Hiện tại, một số dự án như Spiral , Square , Workit và Cashu đang trong quá trình triển khai BIP 177 ở các mức độ khác nhau. Trong một hệ thống mà mặc định là “không thay đổi”, ngay cả một cải tiến nhỏ như BIP 177 cũng phải đối mặt với rào cản cao để được công nhận chính thức. Tóm Lại Là: Cuộc tranh luận về tên gọi đơn vị Bitcoin phản ánh sự cân bằng giữa truyền thống và tính tiện dụng. Dù “satoshi” đã trở thành biểu tượng văn hóa, “bit” hay “bitcoins” có thể mở ra cánh cửa cho việc áp dụng rộng rãi hơn. Với sự dẫn đầu của các dự án như Bitkit Wallet và tiềm năng từ các công ty lớn như Square, BIP 177 có cơ hội tạo ra một bước ngoặt trong cách chúng ta nhìn nhận và sử dụng Bitcoin. Trong thế giới Bitcoin, mọi thay đổi dù nhỏ cũng cần thời gian, kiểm chứng và sự đồng thuận rộng rãi. Liệu BIP 177 có trở thành chuẩn mực hay chỉ là một ý tưởng thú vị? Hãy cùng chờ xem!

2025-06-10T03:45:00,"Ruvi AI (RUVI) Attracts Cardano (ADA) Holders as Industry Experts Forecast Explosive ROI for Early Investors in 2025","The crypto world is buzzing and Ruvi AI (RUVI) is at the center of it all. Cardano (ADA) holders are taking notice and industry experts are predicting explosive returns on investment (ROI) for early backers by 2025. But what’s behind the hype? And how does Ruvi AI differ from Cardano, one of the biggest blockchain platforms in the crypto space? Whether you’re an experienced investor or just looking for new opportunities, this shift from ADA to RUVI is worth understanding. From their tech to growth potential, there’s a lot to unpack. Cardano (ADA): A Blockchain OG Cardano is a well known name in the crypto space and has built a reputation as one of the most reliable and sustainable blockchain platforms. Their Ouroboros proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol made them a green alternative to energy hungry proof-of-work systems like Bitcoin. But no project is immune to market competition. Diversification is always top of mind for forward thinking investors and now Ruvi AI is emerging as a great opportunity for those looking to maximize returns and get in on the next big blockchain wave. Ruvi AI (RUVI): Blockchain + AI Ruvi AI is no ordinary cryptocurrency. It’s a leap forward, blockchain + AI. This decentralized superapp isn’t just for trading or holding, it’s designed to solve real world problems for businesses and individuals. Ruvi AI allows users to create AI driven content in almost any format imaginable, text, audio, video, image creation. This benefits industries like marketing, content production and workflow optimization by providing tools that are efficient, secure and adaptive. At the heart of Ruvi AI’s ecosystem is the $RUVI token which powers the platform and has real utility. It enables seamless transactions, provides token holders with staking rewards and governance rights within the community. Unlike speculative ventures Ruvi AI has real world use cases that make it a future proof project capable of industry disruption. When you combine blockchain’s security with AI’s limitless possibilities you get a technology that’s not only innovative but practical. Ruvi AI’s Presale is a Success The excitement around Ruvi AI is best measured by its presale success. Phase 1 launched at $0.010 and sold out in 2 weeks. Phase 2 increased by 50% to $0.015 and those who joined early got rewarded. Presale has already attracted over 1,400 investors and raised $1.5 million. Ruvi AI is on the move. But that’s not all. Ruvi AI has already listed on an exchange and partnered with a major trading platform to expand its reach. More announcements coming soon. Ruvi AI is building for long term and keeping the momentum going. For those looking for the next big project in the crypto space Ruvi AI is not to be missed. What Do the Numbers Say About RUVI? For investors Ruvi AI’s presale is not just an entry point into a new project, it’s an opportunity for massive capital growth. Here’s a breakdown of the potential returns across 3 investment tiers: VIP 2 Threshold : 50,000 RUVI (Cost = $750 at $0.015/token). Bonus : 40% (20,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 70,000. Potential Returns : At $0.07 Listing Price: $4,900 (553% ROI). At $1 Post-Launch Price: $70,000 (9,233% ROI). VIP 3 Threshold : 100,000 RUVI (Cost = $1,500 at $0.015/token). Bonus : 60% (60,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 160,000. Potential Returns : At $0.07 Listing Price: $11,200 (647% ROI). At $1 Post-Launch Price: $160,000 (10,567% ROI). VIP 5 Threshold : 500,000 RUVI (Cost = $7,500 at $0.015/token). Bonus : 100% (500,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 1,000,000. Potential Returns At $0.07 Listing Price: $7,500 (833% ROI) At $1 Post-Launch Price: $75,000 (13,233% ROI) Why Cardano (ADA) Holders Are Switching to RUVI The migration of Cardano holders to Ruvi AI can be attributed to: Technological Advancement Ruvi AI’s blockchain + AI is a leap forward that Cardano doesn’t offer, so those looking for advanced solutions are switching. Clear Signs of Growth Strong presale, early listings and growing community all point to a well structured and scalable project. Real World Utility Unlike tokens that rely on speculation Ruvi AI solves real world problems with practical applications so investors can bet on it. Massive Upside With analysts predicting explosive ROI and low entry price, early adoption could be huge.

2025-06-10T03:30:51,"On-Chain Data Flashes Bullish: Is Bitcoin Ready for a $110K Comeback?","Bitcoin has resumed its upward trajectory, registering a modest 1.6% gain over the last 24 hours to trade at $107,428. The recovery comes after last week’s dip toward $100,000 levels, which had been triggered by market-wide volatility and profit-taking. While BTC remains approximately 4.2% below its all-time high of $111,000 reached last month, the weekly trend still reflects a 3.3% increase, suggesting buyers are gradually regaining confidence. This market behavior is mirrored in a set of on-chain indicators recently analyzed by CryptoQuant contributor Amr Taha. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Ethereum Defend Key Moving Averages – Bullish Signal Or Temporary Relief? Bitcoin On-Chain Metrics Reflect Accumulation Behavior In Taha’s analysis titled “On-Chain Data Hints at Bitcoin’s Next Leg Higher,” Taha examined several metrics that point to a potential continuation of the rally. These include the Binance Taker Buy/Sell Ratio, UTXO age bands, and the Long-Term Holder (LTH) realized cap. All three suggest that market participants are actively accumulating and that underlying sentiment is shifting toward renewed bullishness. One of the primary indicators Taha focused on is Binance’s Taker Buy/Sell Ratio, which has recently climbed to 1.1. This metric evaluates the volume of aggressive market buys versus market sells on the Binance exchange. A ratio above 1 typically implies that more participants are willing to pay the market price to buy than to sell, indicating stronger buyer conviction. According to Taha, such shifts historically precede continued price increases when supported by volume. Another key metric showing strength is the Buy/Sell Pressure Delta over the last 90 days. This indicator tracks the net difference between buying and selling pressure and is now halfway to its historical peak at 0.02. Taha explains that this suggests a market not yet overheated, with room for further accumulation. Combined with recent breakout behavior above the 1D–1W UTXO band, representing recently transacted coins, this hints that many new holders are currently in profit and choosing to hold rather than sell. LTH Conviction and Stablecoin Inflows Reinforce Bullish Case Taha also noted the Long-Term Holder (LTH) Realized Cap has now surpassed $56 billion, reflecting strong hands holding a larger share of Bitcoin supply. These coins have not moved in over 155 days and are considered to represent investors with higher conviction. The increase in this metric implies that fewer coins are being sold into the market, a signal that many investors are expecting higher valuations in the coming weeks or months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Leveraged Traders Are Back Betting On A Price Decline — What This Means In addition, more than $550 million in stablecoins have reportedly flowed into Binance in recent hours. Historically, such inflows to spot exchanges, as opposed to derivatives platforms, often suggest readiness to deploy capital for direct asset purchases. Notably, all of these indicators can be seen as a leading signal of potential volatility or buying pressure. If this pattern holds, Bitcoin’s short-term price activity may benefit from continued accumulation and institutional positioning.

2025-06-10T03:19:03,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: BTC Holds $109.7K as Bulls Watch $111.8K","Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $109,690, up 3.81% in the last 24 hours, as traders weigh global macro risks and technical momentum. This week’s Bitcoin price prediction leans bullish, following a sharp recovery from the previous week’s dip below $100,400, triggered by the Trump-Musk spat, and a strong bounce fueled by U.S. jobs data and renewed risk appetite. Investors are now watching U.S.–China trade talks in London, a key geopolitical event that may impact risk markets. So far, Bitcoin has remained resilient above $109,000, signaling investor confidence. What’s keeping Bitcoin steady? Apart from macro support, institutional participation is growing fast: Over 80 publicly traded companies (e.g., MicroStrategy, GameStop) now hold BTC The U.S. government owns nearly 200,000 BTC, according to blockchain data Gemini’s IPO filing points to sustained investor interest in crypto firms Together, these factors add legitimacy and long-term demand strength, bolstering bullish Bitcoin price predictions. Bitcoin Faces Key Resistance at $111.8K On the technical side, the Bitcoin price prediction remains bullish as BTC approaches the upper trendline of its ascending channel, testing resistance near $111,848. A breakout here would confirm the bullish continuation setup and target higher resistance levels at $115,103 and $118,358. The daily RSI is holding at 61, signaling positive momentum but leaving room before overbought conditions emerge. Also worth noting: the June 7 bullish engulfing candle, which often marks a return to trend after a retracement. Bitcoin price prediction: short-term trade idea Entry: Confirmed daily close above $111,848 Stop-loss: Below $107,616 Target 1: $115,103 Target 2: $118,358 Watch for: RSI divergence or rejection at $111.8K This bullish setup remains valid as long as BTC stays above the lower channel trendline near $107,000. Crackdowns and M&A Signal Maturing Market Beyond price, structural developments are helping shape Bitcoin’s evolving reputation. In Australia, authorities have just charged four money laundering rings involving $123 million in cryptocurrency, showing that even illicit crypto activity can be traced, which boosts trust in blockchain transparency. $NCPL buys Mixie, a blockchain-native platform building infrastructure and tools for Web3 games, creator media, and decentralized community engagement. pic.twitter.com/gRzkZzSyi2 — Joey Rattlesnake (@tallahassee_m) June 9, 2025 Meanwhile, Netcapital (NCPL) acquired the crypto-native platform Mixie, marking a significant step in crypto mergers and acquisitions (M&A). The fintech firm said the deal enhances its Web3 capabilities, reflecting broader institutional interest. This follows a 2025 trend of consolidation led by players like Coinbase and Ripple. These headlines support the broader Bitcoin price prediction narrative: strong demand, growing corporate adoption, and tightening legal clarity are laying the groundwork for Bitcoin’s next leg up.

2025-06-10T02:16:03,"Why is The Crypto Market Going Up Today?","The post Why is The Crypto Market Going Up Today? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market is back in action today, with a sharp rally across major coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. At the time of writing, the total crypto market capitalization has jumped to $3.43 trillion, showing a healthy 4.22% rise in the past 24 hours. Investor sentiment has also turned positive. The Fear & Greed Index now reads 64, firmly in ‘Greed’ territory — a clear sign that traders are feeling confident about the market’s direction. So, what’s fueling this rally? Let’s break it down. Bitcoin Leads the Charge The star of the show is Bitcoin, which finally broke out of a consolidation range it had been stuck in since May 23rd. Currently trading above $109,500, Bitcoin’s breakout is being closely watched by analysts. This move was expected because of a bullish weekly candle formation called a three-inside-up pattern around the $100,000 mark. Historically, this kind of setup often leads to an 8-10% pump within a week or two. If momentum continues, some analysts believe Bitcoin could soon touch $115,000 — or even higher. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Key Takeaway Points from SEC Chair Paul Atkin’s Remarks at the Crypto Task Force Roundtable Today , Global Factors Also at Play Apart from technical signals, positive news on the macro front is also helping the rally. Reports show that trade talks between the United States and China have resumed, easing global market tensions. This, combined with growing institutional interest , has boosted investor confidence. Altcoins Follow Suit Following Bitcoin’s lead, altcoins are also climbing. Ethereum is up over 8% this week, now trading at $2,699, while Solana and Dogecoin have surged 5% and 6.6% respectively. Interestingly, Sui (SUI) and Hyperliquid (HYPE) have posted impressive double-digit gains. The Altcoin Season Index, however, remains at 30 out of 100, meaning that while altcoins are rallying, a full-fledged alt season hasn’t arrived yet. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The rally is fueled by Bitcoin’s breakout from consolidation, a bullish “three-inside-up” pattern, resumed US-China trade talks, and rising institutional interest. How do renewed US-China trade talks benefit the crypto market? Resumed US-China trade talks ease geopolitical tensions and reduce global market uncertainty, fostering a “risk-on” sentiment that encourages investment in assets like crypto.

2025-06-10T02:02:00,"Why are Bitcoin and other crypto prices rising today?","Bitcoin and most altcoins rose this week, with the former surging to over $110,000 for the first time in weeks. It has jumped by over 50% from its lowest level in April this year. This jump has triggered more gains among altcoins like Fartcoin, AAVE, Dogwifhat, and Uniswap. As a result, the market capitalization of all coins has jumped to over $3.4 trillion, while the 24-hour volume soared by 38% to $130 billion. Let’s explore the top three reasons why Bitcoin and altcoins are going up. SEC crypto roundtable The first main reason why Bitcoin and other crypto prices are going up is that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) held the first decentralized finance (DeFi) roundtable featuring the biggest players in the industry. In a statement, Paul Atkins noted that the SEC supported the industry and the role of self-custody. He also criticized Gary Gensler, the previous regime of Gary Gensler, which focused on lawsuits against companies like Uniswap, Kraken, Coinbase, and Immutable. Analysts believe Atkins will continue supporting the industry, including filing fewer lawsuits and approving ETFs on crypto coins like XRP, Polkadot, Stellar, Hedera Hashgraph, and Tron. Adrian Dittmann @AdrianDittmann · Follow SEC Chair Paul Atkins announces that DeFi platforms will be exempt from regulatory restrictions.He’s also stated that “The right to have self custody of one’s private property is a foundational American value that should not disappear when one logs on to the internet.” Watch on Twitter View replies 1:50 AM · Jun 10, 2025 856 Reply Copy link Read 57 replies US and China trade talks Bitcoin and other altoins are going up because of the ongoing trade talks between the United States and China in London. The two sides are attempting to lower tensions that have been going on for a while. Media reports suggest that China will likely offer to ship are earth materials to the United States in exchange for access to semiconductors. There are also signs that the two countries will work to resolve the outstanding issues on trade. Bitcoin, altcoins, and other assets like stocks do well when there is little tension in the financial market. Trump and Elon Musk potential truce Bitcoin and altcoins are going up because of the potential truce between Elon Musk and Donald Trump . According to USA Today, Musk has been attempting to get back into Trump’s good graces on X. Analysts believe that Musk has a lot to lose if the feud goes on since SpaceX, his company, is one of the top government contractors in the US. As such, Trump may start canceling some of the projects if the feud continues. In an NBC interview, Trump said he had no desire to reconcile with Musk. However, a common phrase is that Trump Always Chickens Out (TACO), meaning that he may open the door back to Musk. A reconciliation may be good for Bitcoin and altcoins because Trump and Musk are popular in the crypto community. Bitcoin price has bullish technicals BTC price chart by TradingView The other reason why Bitcoin and altcoins are going up is that the former has strong technicals that may push it higher in the long term. As the chart above shows, the token has remained above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), a sign that bulls are in control. Bitcoin has also formed a cup-and-handle pattern. It has completed the cup section and is now about to complete the handle part. This cup is 30% deep, meaning that the potential target for the coin is about $142,000. Such a move will likely lead to more gains among altcoins.
