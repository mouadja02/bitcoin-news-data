2025-06-10T16:57:19,"Trump-backed American Bitcoin firm buys $23m worth of Bitcoin ahead of merger","American Bitcoin, a mining firm backed by Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., has accumulated 215 Bitcoin, worth nearly $24 million, since launching operations on April 1, according to a June 6 SEC filing. The company, known formally as ABTC, intends to go public later this year through a stock-for-stock merger with Gryphon Digital Mining. The filing outlines ABTC’s unconventional approach: Bitcoin ( BTC ) ownership isn’t a byproduct of mining—it is the business. The firm describes its strategy as “layered,” focusing on producing Bitcoin below market cost, leveraging capital to expand its treasury, and participating actively in the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. Unlike traditional miners that build and operate their own infrastructure, ABTC contracts out its mining operations. Notably, the firm’s 215 BTC reserve—held securely with Coinbase Custody—is part of an open-ended strategy. ABTC said it plans to increase its holdings over time, depending on market conditions and capital availability. This approach echoes Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin treasury strategy at MicroStrategy, which has influenced a number of corporate accumulators. You might also like: Will Bitcoin continue rising?

2025-06-10T16:50:15,"Bitcoin Acquisition: The Smarter Web Company Expands Strategic BTC Holding","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Acquisition: The Smarter Web Company Expands Strategic BTC Holding In a move signaling continued confidence in the digital asset space, UK-based web development firm, The Smarter Web Company (SWC), recently announced a significant expansion of its BTC holding . This latest Bitcoin acquisition adds another layer to the growing trend of companies integrating cryptocurrency into their treasury management and long-term investment plans. Why Companies Are Embracing a Corporate Bitcoin Strategy The news from The Smarter Web Company isn’t happening in a vacuum. Across the globe, businesses are exploring and adopting a corporate Bitcoin strategy . But why are traditional companies, especially those outside the financial sector, deciding to hold a volatile asset like Bitcoin? Several factors are driving this trend: Inflation Hedge: With global economic uncertainties and rising inflation concerns, many companies view Bitcoin as a potential store of value, similar to digital gold. Its fixed supply is often cited as a key characteristic that could preserve purchasing power over the long term. Potential for Appreciation: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has historically shown significant long-term price appreciation. Companies allocating a portion of their treasury to BTC are often doing so with the expectation of capital growth. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate balance sheet can provide diversification away from traditional assets like cash and bonds, which may yield low returns in the current economic climate. Forward-Thinking & Innovation: Embracing digital assets can position a company as innovative and forward-thinking, potentially attracting talent and investors interested in the future of finance and technology. Liquidity: Bitcoin is a highly liquid asset, easily traded on numerous global exchanges, offering flexibility should the company need to access funds. While the risks are real – primarily price volatility and regulatory uncertainty – the potential benefits are increasingly compelling for companies like The Smarter Web Company. The Smarter Web Company’s Strategic BTC Holding: A Closer Look The core announcement from SWC detailed the purchase of an additional 45.32 BTC. This wasn’t a spur-of-the-moment decision but a deliberate action within their established framework. According to their announcement on X (formerly Twitter), this purchase is a part of their broader, long-term digital asset strategy , specifically referred to as “The 10 Year Plan.” This latest acquisition significantly boosts their total BTC holding . Before this purchase, SWC held a certain amount of Bitcoin. Adding 45.32 BTC brings their total holdings to 168.08 BTC. To put this in perspective, let’s look at the change: Metric Before Acquisition Latest Acquisition After Acquisition BTC Acquired N/A 45.32 BTC N/A Total BTC Holding 168.08 – 45.32 = 122.76 BTC N/A 168.08 BTC This increase represents a substantial percentage jump in their overall Bitcoin reserves, demonstrating a clear commitment to their stated strategy over the long haul. Understanding ‘The 10 Year Plan’ and Digital Asset Strategy Referring to their approach as “The 10 Year Plan” is significant. It explicitly signals that The Smarter Web Company views this digital asset strategy not as a short-term trade or speculation, but as a foundational element of their long-term financial planning. A decade-long horizon suggests they are looking past immediate market fluctuations and are focused on the potential value and utility of Bitcoin over a considerable period. What might a corporate digital asset strategy like this entail over 10 years? It could involve: Phased Accumulation: Like SWC’s recent purchase, the plan likely involves periodic acquisitions, potentially timed based on market conditions or company cash flow. Secure Storage: Implementing robust security measures (like multi-signature cold storage) to protect their significant BTC holding from theft or loss. Accounting and Reporting: Navigating the complexities of accounting for cryptocurrency holdings on their balance sheet according to relevant standards. Risk Management: Developing strategies to mitigate risks associated with price volatility, regulatory changes, and technological advancements. Potential Future Use Cases: While primarily a treasury asset now, the plan might eventually explore using Bitcoin for payments, investments, or other corporate activities as the ecosystem matures. Education and Integration: Ensuring internal teams understand digital assets and integrating this strategy into the company’s overall financial and business operations. This long-term perspective is crucial. It contrasts sharply with short-term trading approaches and aligns more with traditional corporate investment philosophies focused on enduring value. The Smarter Web Company in the Context of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption While companies like MicroStrategy are famous for their massive Bitcoin reserves, accumulating tens of thousands of BTC, SWC’s holding of 168.08 BTC is still noteworthy, especially for a UK-based web development firm. It places them among a growing list of smaller to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that are quietly adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. This trend among SMEs is arguably as important as the large-scale acquisitions by giants. It indicates broader acceptance and integration of digital assets into the mainstream economy. It suggests that the rationale for holding Bitcoin is resonating not just with tech giants but also with established businesses across various sectors. The fact that The Smarter Web Company, a web development firm, is pursuing this strategy is particularly interesting. It highlights the interconnectedness of the tech world and the digital asset space. Web development companies are often at the forefront of adopting new technologies, and their embrace of Bitcoin as a treasury asset could influence other businesses in the tech sector and beyond. Challenges and Considerations for a Corporate Bitcoin Strategy While the benefits are attractive, implementing a corporate Bitcoin strategy comes with challenges. Companies must carefully consider: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience significant swings, which can impact the reported value of the company’s holdings and potentially affect shareholder perception. Regulatory Environment: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving in the UK and globally. Changes could impact how companies hold, manage, or use their Bitcoin. Security Risks: Holding digital assets requires sophisticated security protocols to prevent hacking or loss of private keys. Accounting and Tax: The accounting treatment and tax implications of holding and transacting with Bitcoin can be complex and vary by jurisdiction. Public Perception: Some stakeholders may view holding Bitcoin as risky or speculative, requiring clear communication from the company about its strategy and rationale. The Smarter Web Company, by explicitly stating their “10 Year Plan,” is likely aiming to address some of these concerns by emphasizing the long-term, strategic nature of their digital asset strategy . Actionable Insights for Businesses and Investors The Smarter Web Company’s move offers insights for both other businesses considering digital assets and individual investors: For Businesses: If you’re considering a corporate Bitcoin strategy , start by understanding your objectives (e.g., inflation hedge, growth). Develop a clear, long-term plan like SWC’s. Consult with legal, financial, and security experts familiar with digital assets. Begin with a small allocation you are comfortable with. For Investors: Corporate adoption by companies like SWC is a bullish signal for the long-term growth and acceptance of Bitcoin. Pay attention to companies that are transparent about their BTC holding and digital asset strategy , as this can be an indicator of their forward-thinking approach. Understand that even corporations view Bitcoin as a long-term play, reinforcing the idea of holding through volatility. The increasing number of companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets validates the asset class and contributes to its maturation. Each new Bitcoin acquisition by a company, whether large or small, builds confidence and infrastructure around corporate digital asset management. Conclusion: A Strategic Step in the Digital Asset Journey The Smarter Web Company’s recent Bitcoin acquisition is more than just a transaction; it’s a reinforcement of their commitment to a long-term digital asset strategy . By increasing their BTC holding to 168.08 BTC as part of “The 10 Year Plan,” they are signaling confidence in Bitcoin’s role as a future treasury asset and store of value. This move by a UK-based web development firm underscores the broadening appeal of Bitcoin beyond early adopters and financial institutions. It highlights the strategic thinking required for companies navigating the evolving financial landscape, where digital assets are becoming increasingly relevant. As more companies follow suit, the integration of Bitcoin into traditional corporate finance will likely accelerate, bringing new levels of legitimacy and stability to the market over the coming decade.

2025-06-10T16:46:09,"Negative Rates Return Switzerland as U.S. Faces Higher Yields. What Does it Mean for Bitcoin?","As President Donald Trump's trade war threatens to upend the global economy, an interesting divergence has emerged that could potentially grease the bitcoin BTC bull run. The divergence in consideration is the elevated yields on U.S. Treasury notes that threaten to compound the fiscal issues, and the renewed negative flip in yields on Swiss government bonds. According to data source Investing.com, Swiss government bonds with maturities of up to five years offered negative yields at press time, with the two-year yield at -17.8 basis points. On the contrary, similar-duration Treasury notes offered yields over 4%. The divergence is the bond market's way of telling us that the trade war will have different impacts on various countries, depending on their trade profiles. Those running trade surpluses, such as several European countries and China, will face disinflation or an outright deflation, while countries like the U.S., which import more than they export, will see an increase in price pressures. The specter of deflation in European nations and China could put pressure on their central banks to ease monetary policy aggressively, likely leading to increased capital deployment into alternative investments like bitcoin. Both the Swiss National Bank and the European Central Bank have already cut rates in recent months. Meanwhile, analysts have said that higher yields in the U.S. and the record public debt could accelerate the shift away from U.S. assets and into alternative assets. ""The last time this happened [Swiss yields turned negative in late 2019], it preceded coordinated global easing, repo market seizures, and ultimately pandemic-era QE. Now, it likely reflects a mix of deflationary pressure, eurozone contagion risks, and capital rotating into monetary sovereignty safe havens amid sovereign stress elsewhere,"" pseudonymous analyst EndGame Macro said on X. It's worth noting that bitcoin's 2020-2021 bull run from $5,000 to over $60,000 was characterized by a record amount of negative-yielding government debt worldwide.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/11/negative-rates-are-back-in-switzerland-as-u-s-faces-higher-bond-yields-what-does-it-mean-for-bitcoin,"ASIA|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Switzerland|United States|Bonds|News",cryptocompare

2025-06-10T16:40:10,"Exciting Cardano Bitcoin DeFi Launch: Cardinal Protocol Bridges ADA and BTC","BitcoinWorld Exciting Cardano Bitcoin DeFi Launch: Cardinal Protocol Bridges ADA and BTC The world of decentralized finance (DeFi) is constantly evolving, seeking ways to connect disparate blockchain ecosystems. A significant step in this direction has just been announced, potentially unlocking new possibilities for two of the largest cryptocurrencies. Are you ready to see Cardano Bitcoin DeFi become a reality? What is the Cardinal Protocol? Bridging ADA and BTC Breaking news from the Cardano ecosystem! Charles Hoskinson, the visionary founder of Cardano (ADA), has officially announced the launch of the Cardinal Protocol . This isn’t just any new application; it’s being hailed as the very first Bitcoin (BTC) decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built directly on the Cardano network. This development, initially highlighted by Wu Blockchain, signifies a major leap in cross-chain interoperability, specifically between the Bitcoin and Cardano blockchains. At its core, the Cardinal Protocol aims to bring Bitcoin’s massive liquidity and user base into the burgeoning Cardano DeFi landscape. Historically, accessing Bitcoin within other DeFi ecosystems required wrapped tokens or centralized services, adding layers of complexity and custodial risk. Cardinal seeks to change this paradigm. How Does Cardinal Enable Bitcoin DeFi on Cardano? The magic behind Cardinal’s ability to bridge these two distinct networks lies in its technical foundation. The protocol leverages advanced cryptography, specifically MuSig2 multi-signature technology . This is a crucial element because it allows Cardinal to interact with Bitcoin’s native structure – the unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) – in a secure and non-custodial manner. Let’s break down the key mechanisms: MuSig2 Multi-Signature: This technology allows multiple parties to collaborate on signing a single transaction in a way that appears as a standard single-signature transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain. For Cardinal, this enables the creation of multi-sig wallets where users retain control of their keys, even when their BTC is being utilized within the Cardano DeFi environment. Non-Custodial Functionality: A cornerstone of true DeFi. Cardinal is designed so that users never lose direct control over their underlying BTC assets. The MuSig2 setup ensures that the user is always one of the required signers for any movement of their Bitcoin UTXOs. This dramatically reduces counterparty risk compared to custodial wrapping services. Direct UTXO Interaction: Instead of relying on wrapped BTC tokens (like wBTC), Cardinal interacts directly with Bitcoin’s native UTXO model. This is a more direct and potentially more secure way to represent Bitcoin value on another chain. This technical approach facilitates genuine Cross-chain BTC usability within Cardano’s smart contract platform. What Can You Do with Bitcoin on Cardinal? The primary use cases announced for Cardinal revolve around core DeFi activities: 1. Lending: Users can deposit their native BTC (via the Cardinal protocol’s non-custodial mechanism) and potentially borrow assets on the Cardano network. This unlocks the significant value held in Bitcoin for use within Cardano’s DeFi protocols without needing to sell the BTC. 2. Staking/Yield Generation: While ‘staking’ in the traditional Proof-of-Stake sense doesn’t apply directly to Bitcoin, Cardinal enables users to lock their BTC via the protocol to participate in yield-generating opportunities available on Cardano. This could involve providing liquidity to trading pools or other DeFi strategies, earning returns on their Bitcoin holdings. 3. Ordinals Support: In a nod to the growing interest in Bitcoin-based digital artifacts, Cardinal also supports the use of BTC Ordinals inscriptions as collateral within the protocol. This expands the types of assets that can be leveraged for DeFi activities on Cardano, bringing a new dimension to the platform. This functionality essentially creates a secure and decentralized ADA BTC bridge , allowing value and utility to flow between the two ecosystems. Why is Bitcoin DeFi on Cardano Significant? The launch of the Cardinal Protocol represents a major milestone for several reasons: Increased Interoperability: It directly addresses the long-standing challenge of connecting Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, with other smart contract platforms like Cardano. Unlocking Bitcoin Liquidity: Billions of dollars are held in inactive Bitcoin wallets. Cardinal provides a pathway to utilize this capital within DeFi without requiring users to sell their BTC or trust centralized custodians. Growth for Cardano’s DeFi Ecosystem: By attracting Bitcoin users and liquidity, Cardinal can significantly boost the total value locked (TVL) and activity on Cardano’s DeFi protocols. True Non-Custodial Approach: The reliance on MuSig2 and direct UTXO interaction offers a potentially more decentralized and secure method for cross-chain interaction compared to wrapped tokens. Innovation in Cross-chain BTC: It pushes the boundaries of how native Bitcoin can be used in external DeFi environments. Potential Challenges and the Road Ahead While the launch is exciting, it’s important to consider the potential challenges: Adoption: Will Bitcoin holders be comfortable using a new protocol on Cardano? Education and ease of use will be key. Security Audits: As with any new DeFi protocol, especially one handling cross-chain interactions and significant value, rigorous security audits are paramount. Scalability: How will the protocol scale if large amounts of Bitcoin liquidity flow in? Integration with Existing Cardano DeFi: Seamless integration with existing lending protocols, DEXs, and yield farms on Cardano will be necessary for widespread adoption. The success of Cardinal will depend on its ability to overcome these hurdles and demonstrate reliable, secure functionality. Getting Involved: Actionable Insights For users interested in exploring Bitcoin DeFi on Cardano via Cardinal: Stay Informed: Follow official announcements from the Cardinal team and Cardano ecosystem updates. Understand the Risks: DeFi carries inherent risks, including smart contract vulnerabilities and market volatility. Cross-chain interactions can add complexity. Do your own research (DYOR). Start Small: If you decide to participate, consider starting with a small amount of BTC to understand how the protocol works before committing larger sums. Wallet Compatibility: Ensure you are using a Cardano wallet that supports interaction with the Cardinal protocol. The launch marks the beginning of a new chapter for the ADA BTC bridge narrative. Summary: A New Era for Cardano and Bitcoin The launch of the Cardinal Protocol is a landmark event, bringing native, non-custodial Cardano Bitcoin DeFi to life. By utilizing MuSig2 technology to interact directly with Bitcoin UTXOs and even support Ordinals, Cardinal creates a novel Cross-chain BTC solution on the Cardano network. This initiative has the potential to unlock significant Bitcoin liquidity, fuel the growth of DeFi on Cardano, and establish a robust ADA BTC bridge . While challenges remain, the Cardinal Protocol represents an exciting step towards a more interconnected and capital-efficient decentralized future for both ecosystems.

2025-06-10T16:35:45,"Decentralized Casinos: The Future of Online Gambling","BitcoinWorld Decentralized Casinos: The Future of Online Gambling The gambling world has come a long way, from smoky physical casinos to online platforms, and now, it’s stepping into the future with decentralized casinos. These platforms promise to disrupt the industry by combining technology, finance, and gambling into a seamless experience. In this text, we’ll break down what a decentralized Bitcoin casino is, how it works, and why it might be the future – if the blockchain doesn’t explode in the process. Maybe traditional platforms are better. Of course, we’ll also look at the risks and challenges that come with the shiny new tech. While the road ahead might not be entirely smooth, with transparency and autonomy on the line, the potential is hard to ignore. Let’s dive into the mechanics of this emerging trend. Decentralized Casinos: The Basics Decentralized casinos powered by blockchain technology are here to revolutionize online gambling because, clearly, the traditional online casino experience just wasn’t cutting it. Forget depositing your funds into an account controlled by a platform. In decentralized casinos, you maintain control of your money, thanks to the magic of smart contracts and blockchain. This cutting-edge tech promises security, transparency, and a complete lack of middlemen. Blockchain, first made famous by Bitcoin in 2009 , is the technology that ensures these casinos run without central authorities. It’s all about distributed records across computers, making sure no one can tamper with the games—or your funds. You get to play and win without a casino boss in sight. Characteristic Description Blockchain-powered Blockchain removes the need for intermediaries by distributing transaction records across a network of computers. Thank you, Bitcoin. Smart Contracts No middlemen! Smart contracts automate game fairness, executing terms directly in code. Ethereum gave this the green light for decentralized everything, including gambling. User Control You control your funds, not the casino. Cryptocurrencies ensure you’re the boss of your own wallet. Transparency Every transaction is on the blockchain for the world to see. No hidden tricks here, just cold, hard transparency. The best part? Transparency. All bets, outcomes, and transactions are recorded on the blockchain, making it impossible for shady business to sneak in. Unlike traditional casinos, there’s no way for the house to rig the game when the results are publicly available for verification. Too much for house edge. In this new world of gambling, you’re not trusting an online platform with your funds—you’re trusting an unbreakable blockchain and smart contracts that run the show. It’s a fresh new take on a century-old industry, and while not perfect, it’s certainly aiming to make the casino world a lot more fun, and a lot more secure. What’s next, decentralized slot machines? Oh wait, that’s already a thing! Why Decentralized Casinos Are Gaining Momentum Decentralized casinos aren’t just the latest trend—they’re practically a breath of fresh air compared to traditional casinos. They promise better security, fewer restrictions, and lower fees, all while giving players more control. Here’s a comparison of why decentralized casinos might just be the future of online gambling: Advantage Decentralized Casinos Traditional Casinos Increased Security Blockchain makes it almost impossible for hackers to alter or steal funds. Traditional casinos? Well, they can still be hacked. Anonymity No need for personal info—just play and win in peace. Traditional casinos love asking for your ID. Global Access Anyone, anywhere can play, no borders, no issues. Restricted by geography and local regulations. Low Fees Lower transaction fees, no middlemen eating your funds. Expect hefty fees due to operational costs. Decentralization No central authority controlling you or your money. The house always has the final say—and it’s not always in your favor. Security? Decentralized casinos have it covered, while traditional ones are still vulnerable to breaches. Cryptocurrency transactions ensure extra protection, and anonymity lets you play without a background check. Plus, global access means you can gamble from anywhere, unlike the regional restrictions in traditional casinos. And don’t even get me started on fees – decentralized casinos win there, too. Finally, decentralization means no shady “house” influences—just smart contracts running the show, ensuring fairness. So, yes, decentralized casinos may just have the upper hand. You know, if you’re into security, low fees, and complete control. The Dark Side of Decentralized Casinos Ah, decentralized casinos – where everything is perfect… except for a few small details. Sure, they offer enhanced security and transparency, but let’s not get carried away. There are still a few risks and challenges that could make even the most confident gambler pause for a second. Challenge Risk Lack of Regulation Without regulation, these casinos can be a playgrounds for malicious activities. Volatility of Cryptocurrency Cryptocurrency’s price swings might make your winnings disappear faster than you can say “Bitcoin.” Technical Barriers Not everyone is a blockchain expert, and that could limit who can actually play. Scams and Fraud No regulation means more room for shady schemes to sneak in. One of the biggest drawbacks is the lack of regulation. While Bitz, the trusty traditional online casino, plays by the rules, decentralized casinos operate in the wild west, where fraud and illegal activities can thrive without oversight. And let’s not forget the volatility of cryptocurrencies—one minute you’re up, the next, your Bitcoin has tanked. As for technical barriers, not everyone has the time or energy to become a blockchain expert, and this could keep some players from even bothering. Finally, the lack of oversight opens the door for scams and fraud, making decentralized casinos feel like a game of chance—where the house might not even be the biggest problem. While the promise is great, let’s not forget the road bumps on the way to a decentralized gambling utopia. Conclusion Decentralized casinos are the next big thing, offering security, transparency, and total freedom. Sure, there are a few minor issues like cryptocurrency volatility and lack of regulation. If you’re ready to risk it all, decentralized casinos might just be the future. Or, you know, a bold experiment. Are you feeling lucky enough to gamble on the future of gambling?

2025-06-10T16:35:43,"US Bitcoin Investors Are Buying Again: What Does This Mean for BTC’s Price?","The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a surge in bitcoin (BTC) purchases from investors in the United States. This is a positive occurrence for the sector and could drive a sustained rally in bitcoin’s price. According to a report from the market intelligence platform CryptoQuant, the Coinbase Premium index, which measures U.S. buyer appetite, has reached its highest level in over three months. U.S. Investors Are Buying BTC CryptoQuant analyst Dan revealed that the market has been in an upward trend for eight weeks, starting from mid-April. The surge in the Coinbase Premium shows that buying pressure from Bitcoin investors in the U.S. is supporting the uptrend. Bitcoin’s movement has shown no signs of overheating. Dan says this is a typical sign often seen in rising cycles following corrections. This suggests that the crypto market will see optimistic movements as the bull cycle progresses in the second half of the year. The increased buying pressure from U.S. investors is evident in the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) market. Data from CoinGlass shows that six of the eleven U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded inflows that totaled $386.2 million during trading hours on Monday. The positive flows came after two consecutive days of outflows on Thursday and Friday last week. Besides the positive ETF flows, another sign that buyers are dominating again is the Bitcoin Spot 90-day Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) flashing green for the first time in four months. This metric measures market dominance between buyers and sellers. A separate CryptoQuant analysis disclosed that CVD turning green after a prolonged period in red could mark the start of a new bullish move. New Whales Acquire BTC at Record Pace Furthermore, CryptoQuant discovered that Bitcoin whales have been buying at an increased rate. A filter that isolated new whales from long-dormant cold investors found that a fresh cohort has been stacking BTC at a record pace. This cohort holds ≥ 1,000 BTC with an average coin age of less than six months. Between March 1 and June 4, the holdings of this group of whales doubled, from approximately 500,000 BTC to around 1.1 million BTC. This shows an increase of at least 600,000 BTC worth roughly $63 billion. Additionally, their supply share has climbed from 2.5% to 5.6% of the total BTC circulating supply – this is equivalent to approximately ten months of mining output removed from circulation.

2025-06-10T16:32:07,"Crypto Mining Company Riot Platforms Announces Its Latest Bitcoin Sales Amount! Here Are the Figures in the Mining Industry","There were significant developments in the crypto mining sector throughout May. From the US to Russia, strategic moves and new hardware launches of major players were among the notable headlines in the sector. Riot Platforms Launches First Major BTC Sale of the Year US-based crypto mining company Riot Platforms announced that it sold 475 Bitcoin in April, marking the company’s first major BTC sale since January 2024. Riot tended to hold onto the BTC it had previously produced with a HODL strategy. It is thought that the sale may have been made for operational expenses or to raise funds for new investments. The American Bitcoin company, backed by US President Donald Trump, has accelerated its plans to go public. The company will carry out the IPO process by merging with Gryphon Digital Mining. The merger in question shows that the trend of IPOs via SPAC (special purpose acquisition company) continues in the sector. The Russian government has proposed imposing a value added tax (VAT) on domestic companies that lease mining equipment or provide hashrate (mining power) services to foreign customers. The move aims to regulate international mining operations and increase tax revenues. Mining hardware giant Bitmain has launched a new ASIC mining device offering 9.5 J/TH efficiency. This device, which stands out with its low energy consumption, is especially attractive to large-scale mining farms looking to reduce energy costs. Details regarding the sale of the device will be shared in the coming weeks. These developments in the mining industry show that both political support and technological innovations continue to shape the sector. Energy efficiency-focused devices and public offering strategies indicate that the sector is evolving towards a more corporate and transparent structure. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-10T16:12:07,"Ether More Favored by Traders as Volatility Against Bitcoin Hits Highest Since FTX Crash","Ethereum's ether ETH token, which has been in the shadows of bitcoin BTC for a long time, is now becoming the new favorite. Data from TradingView shows that the spread between Volmex's annualized 30-day ether implied volatility index (EVIV) and bitcoin's 30-day index (BVIV) has jumped to 34%, the highest since November 2022. Back then, the FTX exchange went bust, destroying billions in investor wealth. The widening spread indicates that the market expects significantly larger price swings for ether, and perhaps the broader crypto market, compared to bitcoin in the coming weeks. Ether has recently outshone bitcoin in terms of price gains, largely due to renewed institutional interest in the cryptocurrency. Notably, in the past 24 hours, ether has risen 8% to $2,728, outperforming almost every major cryptocurrency, including market leader bitcoin, which has gained just 1%, CoinDesk data show. ""Ethereum is pumping up with new money. Over the past two weeks, Ethereum ETFs have attracted $812 million, the biggest amount since the beginning of this year,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at The FxPro said in an email. While inflows into the ether spot ETFs have picked up pace, BTC ETFs have managed to draw in less than $400 million in the past two weeks, according to data source SoSoValue. According to the Singapore-based trading firm QCP, several factors have aligned in favor of the ether bulls. ""Looking ahead, macro tailwinds are aligning for ETH. With the GENIUS Act advancing in the US Senate, Circle’s IPO discussions resurfacing, and stablecoins gaining regulatory traction, Ethereum’s native role in tokenization and settlement rails may be primed for outsized structural upside,"" QCP said in a market update. The bias for ether is also evident from the fact that on options exchange Deribit, ETH call options are trading at a premium of at least 2% to 3% relative to puts out to the March 2027 expiry. On the contrary, BTC calls are trading at 0.5%-1.5% premium, according to data source Amberdata. In other words, traders are paying more for the upside exposure in ether compared to bitcoin. ""ETH options markets have surged with 30-day call-skew hitting 6.24% and funding rates spiking to 0.009%, while the term structure of volatility has reinverted once more,"" analytics firm Block Scholes said in its daily report.

As Long As BTC Stays Above This Level, The Rally Will Continue!""","The leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) is following a fluctuating course. At this point, BTC, which fell to the level of $ 100,000 a few days ago, rose above $ 110,000 yesterday. While the CPI and PPI data coming from the USA are expected to increase volatility in BTC, analysis company Matrixport said that the upward trend in Bitcoin is expected to continue. Matrixport analysts said that Bitcoin broke out of the symmetrical triangle formation with its recent rise, signaling that the uptrend will continue. Analysts noted that Bitcoin's rally was powered by new capital inflows and gradually easing concerns about tariffs. Analysts also argued that although the inflation data to be released this week is expected to be high and put pressure on the BTC price, it will not be able to disrupt the upward trend. “Bitcoin broke the $106,000 downtrend line and even climbed above the symmetrical triangle pattern. This move indicates a new capital inflow, which bodes well for Bitcoin, and concerns about tariff uncertainty in the market appear to have eased. Although the US May Consumer Price Index (CPI) is expected to be higher, Bitcoin's current bullish momentum will be difficult to disrupt. Because the US economy is more resilient than expected and as long as Bitcoin maintains $105,075, the uptrend is expected to continue.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-10T16:07:03,"Will Bitcoin continue rising? BTC faces reversal risk after confirming bearish shark pattern","A newly confirmed bearish shark harmonic pattern has formed on Bitcoin’s intraday chart, pointing to a potential retracement in the short term. With the value area high now under pressure and volume metrics signaling a lack of strong buyer commitment, Bitcoin may be setting up for a healthy pullback into deeper volume-supported zones. Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) latest move higher has brought it into technically significant territory, but not without warning signs. A bearish shark harmonic has emerged, suggesting a possible reversal following the recent grind to local highs. As price tests the value area high (VAH), a key inflection point is forming. If Bitcoin loses this level, the next logical targets include the point of control (POC) and the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, both offering strong confluence as support zones. Key technical points Bearish Shark Harmonic Confirmed: The pattern signals the potential for a price reversal or retracement from current levels. Critical Support Zones Below: The point of control and 0.618 Fibonacci lie beneath current price, acting as logical targets if VAH is lost. Volume Participation Remains Average: The recent move lacks the explosive profile of a short squeeze, raising doubts about sustainability. BTCUSDT (1H) Chart, Source: TradingView The bearish shark harmonic adds structure to the current market setup. This specific pattern typically forms at the end of extended corrective moves and often precedes short-term pullbacks. Bitcoin now faces its first major hurdle: the value area high. Failure to hold above this level could trigger a return to the point of control, which represents the highest volume node within the visible range. A further breakdown may open the path toward the value area low, suggesting a complete rotation within the current trading range. You might also like: Ethereum scales strong, but Lightchain AI leads presale with dev-first design Volume behavior supports this retracement thesis. Unlike previous surges characterized by short squeezes, the current rally has unfolded on average volume, without signs of aggressive forced buying. This weakens the bullish case and opens the door to a long squeeze, a slow unwind of long positions that forces traders to exit as price dips toward lower support levels. What to expect in the coming price action All eyes are now on the VAH. A decisive breakdown from this level would confirm the bearish harmonic and signal a controlled move into deeper support areas. Such a retracement would not only be technically valid but also constructive, allowing Bitcoin to reset within its current range before attempting another breakout.

2025-06-10T16:00:14,"Dogecoin Primed For Liftoff If It Can Break This Barrier: Key Price Targets","Dogecoin skidded to a low near $0.168 last week before snapping higher to trade around $0.19 on Tuesday morning, up roughly six percent over 24 hours. The rebound unfolded in lock-step with bitcoin’s own recovery from the technically charged $106,800 level to just above $109,000, re-invigorating short-term dip-buyers across the memecoin complex. Dogecoin Needs To Conquer This Price Level Technical analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) argues that the Fib defence has restored bullish structure—but only up to a point. “After coming down to the .382 Fib Dogecoin finally found the support it needed along with BTC finding support at 100K,” he wrote. “As it goes for the immediate future of **DOGE it has a lot of work to do. Big resistance at .19-.21 cent range will need to be broken in order to head back up to that .26-.28 level. Indicators on the daily time frame look bullish.” Bitcoin’s behaviour therefore remains pivotal. Spot BTC is hovering near $109,000 this morning and has so far defended the $106,800 pivot flagged by several high-profile analysts, including Michael van de Poppe, as the “linchpin for a potential rally”. Should Bitcoin extend toward the $120,000-$130,000 band, Kevin argues that Dogecoin will decouple from its dependence on the benchmark “when dominance tops and the market sniffs out easing monetary policy.” Crypto pundit Chandler (“@ChandlerCharts”) is less sanguine. Overlaying DOGE’s four-day price against DOGE/BTC, market cap and a relative-strength oscillator, his graphic highlights three prior compression phases—shaded grey—where the memecoin failed to sustain outperformance against Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bloodbath Incoming? Dogecoin Must Hold This Level To Survive “Even if DOGE breaks above its November highs, it won’t feel great if DOGE/BTC ends up way lower than it was at the November highs,” he cautioned. Chandler calculates that with BTC at $107,600, Dogecoin would have to print roughly $0.52 simply to reach a higher high against Bitcoin. “If BTC runs to $120-130k, DOGE needs to be around $0.60+ for holding DOGE to make sense over BTC.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Is Going To $1 With The ‘Next Impulse’, Analyst Predicts That threshold underscores the importance of the $0.19-$0.21 supply zone visible on both analysts’ charts. On Kevin’s canvas it coincides with the 0.618-0.703 Fib cluster; on Chandler’s, it overlaps the upper edge of an eighteen-month value area that has repeatedly rejected upside probes. A decisive close above $0.211 would place the May 11 summit at $0.2597 back in play and, more importantly for bulls. For now, traders are watching two numbers: $106,800 on Bitcoin and $0.21 on Dogecoin. A clean break of the latter would validate Kevin’s bullish roadmap toward $0.26-$0.28 and, by extension, keep alive the possibility of Chandler’s higher-high scenario on the DOGE/BTC cross. Until then, the memecoin’s fate indeed “remains in the hands of BTC’s capability in heading higher.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.19.

2025-06-10T16:00:14,"Ethereum ETF Inflows Mark 16 Incredible Days of Strong Growth","BitcoinWorld Ethereum ETF Inflows Mark 16 Incredible Days of Strong Growth The world of cryptocurrency investing is constantly evolving, and one of the most significant developments recently has been the emergence of U.S. spot ETH ETFs. These investment vehicles offer traditional investors an accessible way to gain exposure to Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, without directly holding the asset. Recently, the data has painted a remarkably positive picture for these new funds. On June 9th, U.S. spot ETH ETFs experienced a combined net inflow of $52.7 million . This figure, while perhaps modest compared to some days seen by Bitcoin ETFs, is highly significant as it marks the 16th consecutive trading day of net inflows into these products. This sustained positive trend suggests growing investor interest and confidence in the asset class via regulated financial instruments. What’s Driving These Strong Ethereum ETF Inflows? The consistent positive flow into Ethereum ETF inflows is a multi-faceted phenomenon, influenced by several key factors: Regulatory Clarity: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of the necessary regulatory filings (19b-4 forms) was a pivotal moment. Although S-1 registration statements still need final approval for trading to begin, the regulatory hurdle for listing has largely been cleared. This provides a level of legitimacy and certainty that attracts investors who were previously hesitant about direct crypto exposure. Institutional Interest: Large financial institutions often prefer regulated investment products like ETFs. The presence of major players like BlackRock and Fidelity launching their own ETH ETF products signals institutional confidence and provides familiar, trusted avenues for large capital allocation. Market Positioning: Investors may be positioning themselves ahead of the expected launch of trading for these ETFs. Buying into the funds now, even before public trading begins, allows them to secure their desired exposure early. Post-Approval Momentum: Following the SEC’s decision, there’s natural market momentum and media attention surrounding U.S. spot ETH ETFs , encouraging more investors to explore this option. Ethereum’s Fundamentals: Beyond the ETF structure, Ethereum itself has strong fundamentals, including its role in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and the broader web3 ecosystem. Investors buying the ETF are betting on the continued growth and adoption of the Ethereum network. Breaking Down the Daily Inflows for U.S. Spot ETH ETFs The data from Farside Investors highlights which funds are attracting the most capital. On June 9th, the inflows were distributed among several prominent issuers: Fund Issuer Net Inflow (June 9) ETHA BlackRock $35.2 million FETH Fidelity $12.9 million ETH Grayscale (mini) $4.6 million Other ETH ETFs Various $0 million BlackRock’s significant lead is notable, reflecting the firm’s massive reach and investor trust. Fidelity also captured a substantial portion, while Grayscale’s relatively new ‘mini’ fund (designed as a lower-fee alternative to its flagship product) is also seeing positive movement. The fact that other funds reported no change on this specific day isn’t necessarily negative; it simply means the net activity was concentrated in these three products for that trading session. Why Are Spot Ethereum ETFs Different? Understanding the difference between a Spot Ethereum ETF and other crypto investment products is crucial. Unlike futures-based ETFs, which track the price of futures contracts tied to an asset, a spot ETF holds the underlying asset directly – in this case, actual Ethereum. This is often preferred by investors because it aims to track the real-time market price of ETH more closely, without the complexities and potential contango/backwardation issues associated with futures markets. The approval of U.S. spot ETH ETFs follows the successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier in the year. The performance and significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs likely paved the way and built confidence for the approval of their Ethereum counterparts. This regulatory step is seen by many as a maturation of the crypto market, bringing it further into the traditional financial fold. What Does This Trend in Crypto ETFs Mean for the Market? The consistent stream of Crypto ETFs inflows, specifically into the new Ethereum products, has several potential implications for the broader market: Increased Legitimacy: The existence and success of these regulated products enhance the perception of crypto assets as legitimate investment classes among mainstream investors and financial advisors. Potential Price Impact: Sustained buying pressure from ETFs can absorb supply from the market, potentially leading to upward price movement for Ethereum. While $52.7 million in a single day might not cause immediate massive spikes, 16 consecutive days of millions flowing in creates a consistent demand floor. Broader Adoption: ETFs make investing in crypto significantly easier for individuals and institutions who are uncomfortable dealing with crypto exchanges, wallets, and private keys. This ease of access can drive broader adoption. Market Infrastructure Growth: The operational requirements for managing these ETFs necessitate robust infrastructure for custody, trading, and administration within the traditional finance system, further bridging the gap between TradFi and crypto. Potential Challenges and Considerations for Spot Ethereum ETF Investors While the inflows are positive, potential investors in a Spot Ethereum ETF should also be aware of potential challenges and risks: Market Volatility: Ethereum and the broader crypto market are known for significant price volatility. While the ETF structure provides ease of access, it doesn’t eliminate the inherent price risk of the underlying asset. Regulatory Uncertainty: Although listing has been approved, the regulatory landscape for crypto continues to evolve globally. Future regulations could impact the market or the ETFs themselves. Fees: ETFs charge management fees (expense ratios) which can eat into returns over time, especially compared to holding the asset directly (though direct holding has its own complexities and costs). Tracking Error: While aiming to track the spot price, ETFs can sometimes deviate slightly due to operational factors, though this is typically minimal for well-managed funds. Not Direct Ownership: Owning an ETF share is not the same as owning ETH directly. Investors do not have control over the underlying ETH (e.g., for staking, using in DeFi, or participating in network governance), which are key aspects of the Ethereum ecosystem. Actionable Insights for Potential Investors For those considering exposure to Ethereum, the availability and performance of U.S. spot ETH ETFs offer a new pathway. The sustained inflows suggest a positive market reception. However, it’s crucial to: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand both the potential benefits and the significant risks associated with investing in volatile assets like Ethereum and the ETFs that track them. Consider Your Investment Goals: Determine if an ETF aligns with your objectives regarding ease of access, long-term holding, and risk tolerance. Compare Products: Once trading launches, compare the different ETH ETFs available, paying attention to issuers, fees, and trading volume. Consult a Financial Advisor: Consider speaking with a qualified financial advisor who can help you assess if this investment fits into your overall financial plan. Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice. Investing in cryptocurrencies and related products like ETFs is highly speculative and involves significant risk of loss. Conclusion: A Bullish Sign for Ethereum’s Integration into Finance The consistent flow of capital into U.S. spot ETH ETFs , highlighted by the impressive $52.7 million inflow on June 9th and the streak of 16 consecutive positive days, is a powerful indicator. It underscores growing investor confidence and the increasing integration of Ethereum into traditional financial markets. While the journey for these products is just beginning, the initial reception, particularly the sustained positive inflows led by major players like BlackRock and Fidelity, paints a promising picture for the future accessibility and adoption of Ethereum as an asset class through regulated ETF structures. This trend is a significant development for the entire crypto ecosystem, signaling a maturing market attracting serious capital.

2025-06-10T16:00:11,"$100 Trillion Crypto Boom? Macro Experts Say It’s Closer Than You Think","Global Macro Investor’s head of research Julien Bittel used a marathon X thread on 9 June to stitch together what he calls “The Everything Code”―a demographic-debt-liquidity feedback loop that he believes will catapult the digital-asset complex from today’s roughly $3.5 trillion capitalization to $100 trillion within a decade. Speaking against the backdrop of a crypto market that has already doubled since the start of 2024, Bittel lays the groundwork with a blunt diagnosis of the developed world’s labour market. “The labor force participation rate isn’t going to rise anytime soon – it’s set to keep declining over time. This is a structural problem,” he writes, adding that “humans are already being replaced by AI and robots at a staggering pace, and that shift is only just beginning. This is deflationary.” In his view, shrinking workforces meet unyielding entitlement promises in a cocktail that “reinforces the need for ongoing stimulus to keep the system afloat. Fewer workers. More tech. Same debts.” Bittel’s next step is the fiscal arithmetic. With public and private liabilities already hovering near 120% of global GDP, “the only answer is more debt… That’s how the system survives,” he warns. Should growth sputter, “Debt-to-GDP is going to keep rising over time,” a trend he expects policymakers to absorb through monetary debasement rather than austerity. Debasement, he reminds readers, is the hidden eight-percent annual loss of purchasing power that piles on top of headline inflation. “Cash has quietly become one of the riskiest assets out there,” Bittel argues, forcing savers to seek double-digit nominal returns simply to stand still. The $100 Trillion Crypto Supercycle From there the thread pivots to liquidity, the variable Bittel and GMI founder Raoul Pal have elevated to first-principles status. When GMI combines central-bank balance-sheet expansion with commercial-bank credit creation across major economies, the resulting “ Total Liquidity ” gauge explains about 90% of Bitcoin’s moves and 95% of the Nasdaq-100’s, he writes. “Fewer workers. More tech. Same debts,” means liquidity must keep rising to prevent a credit contraction, and that liquidity, in Bittel’s models, “is the tide that lifts scarce, risk-sensitive assets.” Scarcity is the bridge to Bitcoin. “Bitcoin has been compounding purchasing power faster than any asset in human history—annualizing nearly 150 percent in excess of the debasement rate since 2010,” Bittel notes, while even the Nasdaq’s stellar 13 percent real return “is down 99.94 percent versus Bitcoin since the start of 2012. Shocking…” The superlatives serve a purpose: they frame Bitcoin as the only macro-scale antidote to the policy cocktail of demographic drag, rising leverage and forced liquidity. All of that funnels into his headline projection. “We’re still in the early stages of a global race—a scramble by institutions, sovereigns, and individuals—to accumulate as much Bitcoin as possible,” Bittel writes. That scramble, he believes, will propel the crypto universe “from a $3 trillion asset class today to $100 trillion over the next seven to ten years.” Doing the math, a jump from the current $3.55 trillion market capitalisation implies a 40% compound annual growth rate over a decade, or roughly 61% if the window compresses to seven years—both aggressive, but neither without precedent in earlier crypto cycles. Bittel concedes the path will be “both incredibly challenging and unimaginably rewarding—the worst of times and the best of times,” but he insists Bitcoin is “part of the solution.” He and Pal have called the coming chase for scarce assets “the single greatest wealth-creation opportunity of our lifetimes,” and Bittel closes the thread by declaring that if GMI’s call plays out, it will be “remembered as the greatest macro trade of all time. This is The Everything Code.” Pal, whose own presentation at Real Vision’s Sui Basecamp in May framed crypto as “a supermassive black hole that outperforms and sucks in every other asset,” reaches similar conclusions. He places Bitcoin in what he calls the “ banana zone ,” a reflexive phase in which expanding liquidity and herd behaviour interact to drive parabolic gains, with a cycle target of roughly $450,000 per coin . Pal’s estimates implies a Bitcoin capitalization only well above $40 trillion even without altcoins—complementing Bittel’s upper-bound scenario. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $3.37 trillion.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/100-trillion-crypto-boom/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Crypto News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|crypto|Crypto market news|crypto news|Crypto price prediction|crypto prices|The Everything Code",cryptocompare

2025-06-10T15:52:11,"Tether to open-source upcoming Bitcoin mining operating system","Stablecoin giant Tether will open-source its Bitcoin mining software to help smaller miners participate in the mining sector without having to depend on expensive platforms. According to Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, who announced the plans in a recent X post , the idea behind this initiative is to “make mining great again,” and part of a broader effort to decentralize Bitcoin’s infrastructure. The Bitcoin Mining Operating System (MOS), scheduled for release in the fourth quarter of 2025, will be freely available with full documentation and user guides. Tether says this will enable companies of all sizes to operate mining setups without relying on proprietary third-party software, lowering the cost of entry for smaller players. The decision to open-source MOS comes at a time when the Bitcoin mining sector is becoming increasingly competitive. Larger firms continue to dominate due to economies of scale, favourable electricity contracts, and access to capital markets. Following the 2024 halving, many of these firms have shifted their strategies by building large Bitcoin treasuries or repurposing hardware for artificial intelligence applications. By contrast, small-to-mid-sized mining operations have struggled to keep up with growing infrastructure costs and high upfront capital requirements. Tether’s initiative aims to level the playing field by offering open-source tools that can run on both minimal hardware setups, such as Raspberry Pi boards, and large-scale mining farms. What is MOS? Ardoino said the MOS was designed with a peer-to-peer Internet of Things architecture and supports a wide array of hardware vendors, including immersion and air-cooled containers, as well as electrical components such as thermostats. This flexibility is expected to make the system more accessible to smaller operators, including businesses generating their own energy through solar or hydro setups. One of MOS’s standout features is its modular plugin system, which would allow developers to create and share custom components suited to various mining setups, making the overall architecture more customizable according to operational needs. There are also plans to integrate Tether’s in-house decentralized AI platform QVAC (QuantumVerse Automatic Computer), which allows AI agents to run locally on user devices without relying on cloud services. A QVAC integration would help “build better reports and enhance production/performance based on custom AI tools that learn from the huge datasets generated by the Mining OS,” Ardiono added. Simply put, QVAC enables mining operations to deploy AI agents directly on local hardware, allowing for real-time performance optimization, predictive maintenance, and improved energy efficiency. The latest decision is one of the many initiatives launched by Tether to support decentralization within the Bitcoin ecosystem. In April, the stablecoin issuer partnered with the Ocean mining pool to help distribute block-building power by directing its hashrate to the protocol. At the time, Ardiono said Tether intends to “fortify Bitcoin against centralizing forces.” The post Tether to open-source upcoming Bitcoin mining operating system appeared first on Invezz",invezz,https://invezz.com/news/2025/06/10/tether-to-open-source-upcoming-bitcoin-mining-operating-system-to-promote-decentralization/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MINING|TECHNOLOGY|USDT","Crypto|Crypto business|Bitcoin|Tether",cryptocompare

2025-06-10T15:41:00,"Bitcoin Trading Volume Surpasses 3-Day Average, Signalling Strong Buyer Conviction (Technical Analysis)","Summary Bitcoin rallies 4.5% on Monday to hit $110,600 after strong volume surge. Early Tuesday dip sees Bitcoin retrace 1% to $109,100. Golden cross at $105,400 reinforces bullish momentum. By Artem Shendetskii Bitcoin's price ( BTC-USD ) started the second week of June 2025 on a strong note, rallying by 4.5% on Monday to reach a high at $110,600. This marks the fourth consecutive daily gain and extends its bullish momentum deeper into all-time high territory. What made Monday’s move significant was the increase in trading volume, which exceeded that of the previous three days, highlighting strong conviction from buyers. The surge pushed Bitcoin to within 1.3% of its all-time high at $112,000, setting the tone for potential upside continuation. However, early Tuesday trading has seen some pullback. The price declined gradually from the Monday close and is currently down 1% on the day, trading near $109,100 as of the European session. The slight drop has reduced this week’s cumulative gain to 3.5%, although the month-to-date performance still holds a solid 4.2% advance. BTC price dynamics (Jan - June 2025). Source: TradingView This retracement does not come unexpectedly. On the 4-hour chart, Monday’s price surge pushed the RSI indicator into overbought territory, which likely triggered some profit-taking by short-term traders. Bitcoin golden cross at $105,400 solidifies short-term bullish bias The technical backdrop, however, still paints a bullish picture. Monday’s surge caused a golden cross formation at $105,400 on the 4-hour timeframe. The 20 EMA crossed above both the 50 and 100 EMAs, and the 50 EMA also moved above the 100 EMA, reinforcing upward price momentum. This golden cross now places the 20 EMA around the $107,000 zone, a level that could act as the first line of defense in the event of deeper intraday pullbacks. Despite today’s mild decline, the broader trend remains supported by the daily RSI, which continues to hover in bullish territory without flashing any fresh overbought warnings. If the price finds support at $107,000 and volume steps back in, Bitcoin may resume its ascent. The key barrier to break is the $110,775 supply level. A decisive move above that level could open the path toward testing the all-time high at $112,000. Unless selling pressure intensifies below $107,000, the outlook leans toward a potential recovery in the upcoming sessions, fuelled by the ongoing technical strength and momentum. Bitcoin extends three-day rally from a four-week low but faces intraday resistance . Key EMAs converge to form a critical support zone around $105,350.

2025-06-10T15:40:54,"Michael Saylor Urges Apple to Buy Bitcoin","Popular Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor urges multinational technological company Apple to buy BTC amid criticisms of its stock buyback program. The executive chairman of MicroStrategy (now Strategy) made the recommendation today shortly after American TV personality Jim Cramer criticized Apple’s stock buyback program. Apple Stock Buyback Program ‘Not Working’For perspective, Apple commenced a $110 billion stock buyback program last year. The move was part of an effort to boost the stock’s price by reducing the number of outstanding shares in the market. Over a year after commencing the initiative, Apple’s stock has plummeted significantly, with its price down 17.13% year-to-date. Following the devastating collapse, Cramer took to X today to criticize Apple’s stock buyback initiative, suggesting that the program is not working. The popular TV personality suggested that Apple should either abandon the initiative to ‘earn a lot’ or integrate with some of the stock. Saylor Urges Apple to Buy BitcoinIn response, Saylor stated that Apple should buy Bitcoin rather than repurchase its shares. https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1932378535676781013Saylor’s commentary does not come as a surprise as the Strategy chairman has been a major Bitcoin advocate since the company acquired its first BTC in August 2020. The Bitcoin advocate has been encouraging retail and institutional investors to acquire BTC as a shield against economic uncertainties. Strategy has continued to express its belief in Bitcoin by scooping Bitcoin almost weekly. Yesterday, Saylor announced that Strategy purchased another 1,045 BTC for $110.2 million. This boosted Strategy’s Bitcoin stash to 582,000 BTC, which is worth approximately $40.79 billion. However, with Bitcoin currently trading at $109,005, Strategy’s Bitcoin portfolio is currently worth $63.44 billion, representing an ROI of over $20 billion. Performance of Apple and Strategy’s Shares Meanwhile, Strategy’s Bitcoin exposure has positively impacted the price of its shares. While Apple’s stock has declined 17.13% since the start of the year, Strategy’s stock has surged 30.26% in the same timeframe. Moreover, Apple’s shares have experienced a slight surge of 5.14% over the past year compared with a 143.98% increase in Strategy’s stocks. Based on the incredible performance of Strategy’s shares, driven by its strong Bitcoin ties, Saylor believes Apple could boost the value of its stock by acquiring BTC. Widespread Adoption of Bitcoin Among Corporate Entities In the meantime, corporate entities are steadily joining the Bitcoin bandwagon and adding BTC to their balance sheets. Although Strategy is spearheading the corporate acquisition of Bitcoin, companies such as Metaplanet , GameStop, and Tether have also purchased significant amounts of BTC. Saylor expects more companies to follow suit in the coming weeks, joining the more than 100 public firms that currently hold BTC in their balance sheets. In his view , companies holding Bitcoin are likely to succeed compared to those that do not own the premier asset. He recently expressed confidence in his $13 million prediction for the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Saylor emphasized that he is more bullish about the forecast due to factors like increased institutional adoption, a supply squeeze, and regulatory clarity.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/10/michael-saylor-urges-apple-to-buy-bitcoin/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=michael-saylor-urges-apple-to-buy-bitcoin,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|USDT","Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today|Michael Saylor News",cryptocompare

2025-06-10T15:40:03,"Siebert Financial Unlocks $100M for Bold Crypto and AI Expansion","BitcoinWorld Siebert Financial Unlocks $100M for Bold Crypto and AI Expansion Big news from the traditional finance world signaling deeper dives into the digital realm! Siebert Financial , a name with a long history in brokerage services, recently made a significant announcement that could reshape its future trajectory. On June 9, the company revealed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) declared its shelf registration on Form S-3 effective. This is a key step, as it allows Siebert Financial to raise a substantial amount of capital – specifically, up to $100 million – through the sale of various securities over time. What Does This Funding Mean for Siebert Financial? This isn’t just about raising money; it’s about funding strategic initiatives. Siebert Financial intends to deploy the proceeds from this offering to fuel growth aligned with its long-term strategic vision. The company highlighted several key areas where these funds will be directed. These include: Potential acquisitions to expand its market reach or service offerings. Significant crypto investment , targeting prominent digital assets . Development and integration of AI-driven technologies across its business lines. This move clearly indicates Siebert’s intent to innovate and adapt to the evolving financial landscape, which increasingly includes digital assets and advanced technology. Why Focus on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana? The press release specifically mentioned investments in Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). These aren’t random choices; they represent some of the largest and most established cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, as well as a prominent layer-1 blockchain known for its speed and scalability (Solana). Targeting these specific assets suggests a calculated approach to entering or expanding within the crypto space. Bitcoin is often seen as digital gold and a primary store of value, while Ethereum is the leading platform for decentralized applications, smart contracts, and NFTs. Solana represents a newer generation of blockchain technology. Investing in this mix could provide Siebert Financial exposure to different facets of the crypto market, from foundational assets to platforms supporting innovation. How Will AI Technology Play a Role? Beyond digital assets, Siebert Financial is also earmarking funds for AI development. Artificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionize financial services in numerous ways. For Siebert, this could mean: Enhancing trading platforms with AI-powered analytics or execution. Improving customer service through AI chatbots or personalized recommendations. Streamlining back-office operations and risk management with automated systems. Developing sophisticated tools for analyzing market trends, including those in the digital assets space. Integrating AI could lead to greater efficiency, improved client experiences, and more sophisticated operational capabilities, positioning Siebert Financial for future challenges and opportunities. What Does This Signal for Traditional Finance and Crypto? Siebert Financial’s decision to explicitly allocate significant funding towards crypto investment and AI is a notable event. It reflects a growing trend among traditional financial institutions recognizing the importance and potential of these emerging technologies. While some firms have been hesitant, others are actively exploring ways to incorporate digital assets and AI into their core strategies. This move by Siebert could be seen as a validation of the increasing relevance of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum within broader investment portfolios. For investors, this could mean Siebert Financial might eventually offer more direct access to crypto markets or integrate crypto insights into their existing services. It highlights the convergence of traditional finance and the digital asset ecosystem. Are There Challenges Ahead? While the potential is significant, navigating the crypto and AI landscapes isn’t without challenges. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, which can impact investment values. Regulatory environments for digital assets are also still evolving, requiring careful navigation. Implementing new AI technologies requires substantial expertise, infrastructure investment, and careful consideration of ethical implications and data privacy. Siebert Financial will need to carefully manage these risks as it executes its strategic plan. The success of their venture will depend on market conditions, regulatory developments, and the effectiveness of their technology integration. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards the Future Siebert Financial’s plan to raise up to $100 million, with a clear intent to invest in crypto investment (including Bitcoin , Ethereum , and Solana) and AI technology, marks a bold step. It demonstrates a commitment to adapting and innovating in a rapidly changing financial world. This strategic funding positions Siebert to explore new revenue streams, enhance its technological capabilities, and potentially attract a new generation of clients interested in digital assets . It’s a clear signal that established players are increasingly looking towards the future, where traditional finance and decentralized technologies may coexist and even converge.

2025-06-10T15:39:08,"Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) Approaches Critical Level in Trading Volume! Here Are the Details","Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which launched in the US in January 2024, are on track to reach $1 trillion in cumulative trading volume in less than 18 months. US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Near $1 Trillion Trading Volume Threshold This impressive growth demonstrates that interest in digital assets continues to be strong among both institutional and individual investors. ETFs, which saw a trading volume of $100 billion in the first two months after launch, exceeded $200 billion in April 2024, while the Bitcoin price reached its highest level in that period at $74,000. However, over the following seven months, the Bitcoin price consolidated in the $50,000–$70,000 range, while the momentum in trading volume slowed somewhat. The market was revived after pro-crypto Donald Trump won the presidential election in November 2024. While Bitcoin reached new highs, the trading volume of ETFs quickly exceeded $500 billion. In February 2025, this volume reached $750 billion. As of today (June 9), the total transaction volume is $995.2 billion. With a daily transaction volume of $2.3 to $4.4 billion, the $1 trillion threshold is expected to be passed in a few days. This growth puts spot Bitcoin ETFs in the same league as the world’s largest and most established ETFs, such as the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) and Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ). In comparison, spot Ethereum ETFs, which launched in July 2024, have generated only $83.4 billion in total trading volume to date. BlackRock's IBIT Fund Leads the Industry The clear leader in the spot Bitcoin ETF market is BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). IBIT had a 22% market share at launch, but as of today, it has risen to 79%. BlackRock’s ETF also alone holds $70 billion of the $120 billion in assets under management across the industry. IBIT also surpassed the $70 billion AUM mark in just 341 trading days, breaking the previous record of the gold-based SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) ETF, which had a trading record of 1,691 days, by quintuple. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-10T15:34:52,"Bitcoin Network Activity Hits 18-Month Low, but This Points to Looming Explosion: CryptoQuant","The Bitcoin network has recently experienced a slowdown in activity, but CryptoQuant believes this could precede a massive upsurge. The analytical platform revealed today that its proprietary Network Activity Index has dropped sharply to 3,470, marking one of the lowest levels recorded in the last 18 months. Bitcoin CryptoQuant Network Activity Index However, CryptoQuant emphasized that such periods of low network engagement have historically preceded major explosions. As a result, the platform suggested that this quiet phase might be the calm before a potential surge.Data Shows Bitcoin Network Activity is DownOne of the major findings from the report was the notable decline in retail investor interest. Specifically, on-chain transaction volumes between $0 and $10,000 have fallen by over 5%. This decline shows a drop in participation from small investors. Retail Investor Demand | CryptoQuant Adding to this subdued outlook, spot trading volumes on centralized exchanges have receded to levels last seen in October 2020. Notably, this represents a 4.5-year low and shows there is minimal movement of Bitcoin across both exchanges and on-chain channels. Bitcoin CEX Spot Trading Volume | CryptoQuant Interestingly, despite the ongoing demand from Bitcoin ETFs, which saw $386 million in net inflows yesterday, the CryptoQuant data indicates that there is a lack of organic interest in direct Bitcoin transactions.LTHs Remain Unfazed While Interest in Futures Trading Grows However, while short-term interest seems to be declining, long-term investor confidence remains strong. For one, CryptoQuant highlighted that about 847,200 BTC have recently transitioned into long-term holder supply. Bitcoin LTH Supply | CryptoQuant What this means is that these coins have remained dormant for over 155 days, suggesting that a large portion of investors are opting to hold their assets rather than engage in frequent trading. For perspective, the market witnessed behaviors like this during the accumulation phases observed in September and October 2024. Such a trend indicates strong conviction in future price growth among market participants.Now, while Bitcoin network activity is down, Ethereum's futures market is showing a different trend. According to CryptoQuant, Open Interest has climbed to an all-time high of 7.17 million ETH. This spike suggests that while the spot market remains dormant, speculative interest, particularly in Ethereum, is growing. Ethereum Open Interest | CryptoQuant CryptoQuant also noted a surge in futures trading frequency among retail investors, with the frequency surpassing its one-year average. This could be signaling overcrowding in derivatives markets, as retail speculation in the futures market grows.https://twitter.com/cryptoquant_com/status/1932437449382269144Analysts Confident in Bitcoin Upside PotentialAmid these developments, Bitcoin continues its volatile movements. The asset recently peaked at $110,617 before facing a 1.19% drop, settling at $108,911. Despite this dip, Bitcoin remains 8.44% higher than its June 5 low of $100,430. Notably, analyst Henry recently confirmed that BTC is currently holding steady above $105,400. He pointed to a bullish flag pattern on the daily chart, suggesting that it is close to completion. According to him, a breakout above the upper trendline could send Bitcoin soaring to the $120,000 mark. In a separate analysis, Michael XBT, who previously predicted XRP's seven-year symmetrical triangle breakout, identified a long-standing resistance on Bitcoin's one-week chart. https://twitter.com/MichaelXBT/status/1932169291249672304He pointed out that Bitcoin is approaching the breakout point of an eight-year resistance line. Michael believes this breakout will be unlike any other, predicting it will trigger a FOMO-driven rally of unprecedented scale, likening the potential move to a digital gold rush. The Crypto Basic also discussed a recent analysis from Benjamin Cowen, founder of Into The Cryptoverse. Specifically, he highlighted that the 200-week Simple Moving Average (SMA) has historically served as a reliable indicator for market cycle tops. Cowen noted that when the 200W SMA reaches the previous cycle's top, it often marks the current cycle's peak. At present, Bitcoin trades at $108,911, while the 200W SMA is at $48,711. This considerable gap from the previous cycle's high of $69,000 suggests Bitcoin still has much upside potential in this ongoing cycle.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/10/bitcoin-network-activity-hits-18-month-low-but-this-points-to-looming-explosion-cryptoquant/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitcoin-network-activity-hits-18-month-low-but-this-points-to-looming-explosion-cryptoquant,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Market|Bitcoin Price Prediction|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today",cryptocompare
2025-06-10T15:30:55,"SPAC Merger: SilverBox Corp IV Signs LOI with Parataxis, Boosting Digital Asset Confidence","BitcoinWorld SPAC Merger: SilverBox Corp IV Signs LOI with Parataxis, Boosting Digital Asset Confidence Big news from the intersection of traditional finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets! SilverBox Corp IV, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) backed by the reputable investment and advisory firm SilverBox Capital, recently announced a significant move. According to reports from Business Wire, SilverBox Corp IV has signed a non-binding letter of intent (LOI) to merge with Parataxis Holdings. What is a SPAC Merger and Why Does This One Matter? Before diving deeper, let’s quickly touch upon what a SPAC is. A SPAC, or Special Purpose Acquisition Company, is essentially a shell company created to raise capital through an initial public offering (IPO) with the sole purpose of acquiring an existing company. They are often called ‘blank check companies’ because investors don’t know which company the SPAC will merge with when they invest. The potential merger between SilverBox Corp IV and Parataxis Holdings is particularly noteworthy because it involves a SPAC targeting a digital asset firm . This isn’t just another corporate merger; it signifies a potential bridge being built between conventional public markets and the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency and blockchain space. It allows a private digital asset company to potentially go public through a streamlined process compared to a traditional IPO. Introducing Parataxis : A Key Player in Digital Assets So, who exactly is Parataxis Holdings? The company is closely affiliated with Parataxis Capital Management, a multi-strategy investment firm deeply focused on the digital asset landscape. Unlike some firms that dabble in crypto, Parataxis Capital Management has carved out a niche with specialized expertise. Their focus areas include managing Bitcoin treasuries – helping companies and institutions strategically hold and manage Bitcoin on their balance sheets. They also actively pursue a range of other digital asset investment opportunities, suggesting a broad engagement across the crypto ecosystem beyond just Bitcoin. Understanding the Significance for the Digital Asset Firm Sector This proposed SPAC merger could have several implications for the broader digital asset sector: Increased Legitimacy: A successful merger could lend further legitimacy to the digital asset space in the eyes of traditional investors and institutions. Access to Capital: Going public via a SPAC could provide Parataxis with significant capital for expansion, product development, or further investments. Market Access: It offers public market investors a potentially easier way to gain exposure to a dedicated digital asset investment firm. Trend Indicator: If successful, this could pave the way for more digital asset companies to explore similar routes to the public market. What Happens After the LOI? Exploring the Path for SilverBox Corp IV It’s crucial to remember that an LOI is non-binding. It signals serious intent but is not a final agreement. The next steps typically involve: Extensive due diligence by SilverBox Corp IV into Parataxis’s financials, operations, and legal standing. Negotiation of a definitive merger agreement outlining the terms, valuation, and structure of the transaction. Regulatory approvals from bodies like the SEC. Approval from the shareholders of SilverBox Corp IV. The process can be complex, and there’s no guarantee the deal will close. However, the signing of the LOI indicates that both parties see significant potential value in the combination. Why Focus on Bitcoin Treasuries ? Parataxis Capital Management’s expertise in managing Bitcoin treasuries is particularly relevant today. With more corporations considering or already holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets, specialized knowledge in managing the risks and opportunities associated with this unique asset class is in demand. This focus highlights Parataxis’s deep understanding of a specific, growing area within the digital asset space. Conclusion: A Bold Step for Parataxis and the Digital Asset Market The non-binding LOI between SilverBox Corp IV and Parataxis Holdings represents a potentially significant development. For SilverBox Corp IV, it offers a path into the dynamic digital asset market. For Parataxis, it could provide the resources and public platform to accelerate its growth and expertise, particularly in areas like managing Bitcoin treasuries . While challenges remain before a definitive agreement is reached and the SPAC merger is completed, this move underscores the increasing convergence of traditional finance and the innovative world of digital assets, signalling confidence in the future of this sector.

2025-06-10T15:20:53,"US Spot Bitcoin ETFs See Massive $385M Inflows","BitcoinWorld US Spot Bitcoin ETFs See Massive $385M Inflows Are you tracking the pulse of the cryptocurrency market? If so, you know that the performance of US spot Bitcoin ETFs has become a critical indicator of mainstream and institutional interest in the leading digital asset. On June 9th, these investment vehicles once again showed significant strength, recording substantial net inflows that signal continued appetite for Bitcoin investment among traditional finance players. Understanding US Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Their Significance Before diving into the numbers, let’s quickly recap what US spot Bitcoin ETFs are and why their activity is so closely watched. These exchange-traded funds hold actual Bitcoin as their underlying asset, offering investors exposure to BTC’s price movements without the need to directly buy, store, or secure the cryptocurrency themselves. Launched in January 2024, they represent a major bridge between the traditional financial system and the digital asset space. The approval and subsequent performance of these ETFs are widely seen as a watershed moment for institutional crypto adoption. They provide a regulated, accessible, and familiar investment structure for large funds, wealth managers, and even retail investors who prefer brokerage accounts over crypto exchanges. Significant Bitcoin ETF inflows are often interpreted as a bullish signal, indicating that more capital is entering the Bitcoin ecosystem through these regulated channels. Breaking Down the Latest Bitcoin ETF Inflows: June 9th Highlights The data for June 9th paints a clear picture of positive momentum. According to figures shared by Trader T on X, US spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively saw net inflows totaling a remarkable $385.47 million . This figure represents the total amount of new capital flowing into these funds, minus any outflows. Let’s look at which specific funds led the charge: Fidelity’s FBTC: Leading the pack with a substantial $172.99 million in net inflows. Fidelity has consistently been a strong performer since the ETFs launched. BlackRock’s IBIT: Not far behind, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust recorded impressive inflows of $120.13 million . IBIT has been a dominant force in the market since its inception. Bitwise’s BITB: The Bitwise Bitcoin ETF also saw significant interest, attracting $68.55 million in net inflows. ARK Invest/21Shares’ ARKB: Added another $10.83 million to its holdings. VanEck’s HODL: Recorded inflows of $7.68 million . Grayscale’s mini BTC: Grayscale’s smaller Bitcoin fund (distinct from its converted GBTC) saw modest inflows of $5.29 million . Several other ETFs in the market reported no change in their holdings for the day, indicating stable but not actively growing capital. What’s Driving This Institutional Crypto Appetite? The sustained trend of positive Bitcoin ETF inflows , especially from major players like BlackRock and Fidelity, raises the question: what factors are motivating this continued influx of institutional crypto capital? Several potential drivers are at play: Regulatory Clarity: The very existence of regulated US spot Bitcoin ETFs provides a level of comfort and compliance that many large institutions require before allocating significant capital to an asset class. Macroeconomic Environment: In an era of potential inflation concerns and economic uncertainty, Bitcoin is increasingly being considered as a potential hedge or a store of value, similar to digital gold. Post-Halving Dynamics: The recent Bitcoin halving event reduced the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market, which historically has been a bullish catalyst. Institutions may be positioning themselves based on anticipated supply/demand shifts. Growing Acceptance: As Bitcoin matures and gains wider recognition, the perceived risk associated with Bitcoin investment decreases for traditional investors. Yield Opportunities (Indirect): While the spot ETFs themselves don’t offer yield, the broader institutional involvement in crypto can open up other avenues and services that make the asset class more attractive. These factors combined create a compelling narrative for institutions looking to diversify their portfolios and gain exposure to the digital asset space through familiar, regulated products like the US spot Bitcoin ETFs . Impact of Strong Bitcoin Investment on Crypto Market Trends The consistent flow of hundreds of millions of dollars into US spot Bitcoin ETFs has a tangible impact on crypto market trends . Here’s how: Price Support and Potential Appreciation: Every dollar flowing into these ETFs generally requires the purchase of Bitcoin on the open market by the fund managers. This creates demand, which can support the price of BTC and potentially drive it higher, especially when inflows are strong and consistent. Increased Liquidity: More participants and larger capital flows generally increase the liquidity of the Bitcoin market, making it easier to buy and sell larger quantities without significantly impacting the price. Validation of the Asset Class: Significant Bitcoin investment via mainstream financial products like ETFs lends credibility to Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, potentially attracting even more capital over time. Influence on Altcoins: While the direct impact is on Bitcoin, positive sentiment generated by strong BTC performance and institutional interest often spills over into the broader cryptocurrency market, influencing other crypto market trends . The inflows on June 9th are not just numbers; they represent real capital being deployed, reinforcing the growing integration of Bitcoin into the global financial landscape. Future Outlook for US Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Institutional Adoption Looking ahead, the trajectory for US spot Bitcoin ETFs appears promising, though not without potential volatility. Continued positive inflows could signal sustained institutional crypto adoption throughout 2024 and beyond. As these products become more established, we might see: Increased competition among ETF providers, potentially leading to lower fees. Development of new related products, such as options on Bitcoin ETFs. Greater integration of Bitcoin and other digital assets into traditional investment portfolios. However, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is inherently volatile. Macroeconomic shifts, regulatory changes, and unforeseen market events could impact the pace of inflows and the performance of these ETFs. Despite potential headwinds, the foundation laid by the successful launch and performance of these US spot Bitcoin ETFs suggests a long-term trend towards greater Bitcoin investment by institutions. Actionable Insights for Investors So, what does this mean for you as an investor tracking crypto market trends ? Monitor Inflow Data: Keep an eye on daily and weekly inflow data for US spot Bitcoin ETFs . While not the only factor, consistent strong inflows can be a positive indicator for Bitcoin’s price action. Understand the Players: Note which firms (like Fidelity, BlackRock, Bitwise) are seeing the most inflows, as this reflects where institutional and large-scale retail interest is consolidating. Consider Your Strategy: If you are considering Bitcoin investment , understand the different avenues available – direct purchase, ETFs, or other products. ETFs offer convenience and regulatory oversight but also have management fees. Stay Informed: The market is dynamic. Follow news related to regulatory developments, macroeconomic factors, and on-chain analytics, all of which influence crypto market trends and ETF performance. The activity in US spot Bitcoin ETFs is a powerful lens through which to view the evolving relationship between traditional finance and digital assets. The June 9th inflows are just one snapshot in this ongoing story of adoption. Conclusion: A Strong Vote of Confidence The $385.47 million in net inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs on June 9th is a significant data point, highlighting continued strong interest from investors, particularly through regulated channels. With Fidelity and BlackRock leading the charge, these numbers underscore the growing acceptance and integration of Bitcoin into mainstream investment portfolios. This trend of robust Bitcoin ETF inflows is a key driver influencing current crypto market trends and serves as a strong vote of confidence in Bitcoin as a viable and increasingly attractive asset class for both retail and institutional crypto participants. As the market matures, monitoring these flows will remain essential for understanding the forces shaping the future of digital asset investment.

Bitcoin represents a “digital gold” solution, weightless and capped at 21 million coins. An engineering mindset led Saylor to view Bitcoin as a thermodynamically sound system. Michael Saylor’s journey to Bitcoin began during the 2020 crisis when his company faced potential decline amid zero interest rates and remote work threats. Speaking with Jordan Peterson in a podcast , the Strategy executive explained how his engineering background and study of monetary history led him to conclude that traditional stores of value fail over extended timeframes, making Bitcoin the superior choice for preserving wealth. The billionaire’s analysis focuses on historical currency patterns that many investors overlook. According to Saylor, currencies collapse every 30 to 40 years across most political jurisdictions throughout human history. Even the US dollar, which he calls “the winning currency of the 20th century,” has lost 99.9% of its purchasing power over the past century. He stated that a house in Miami Beach that cost $100,000 in 1930 would require $100 million today.

2025-06-10T15:13:59,"Ethereum price prediction: analysts say $4,000 in reach as institutions diversify from Bitcoin","Ethereum is gaining momentum as institutional investors begin to diversify away from Bitcoin, according to analysts at B2BINPAY. Ethereum (ETH) is showing signs of a potential bull run, as institutions prepare to diversify from Bitcoin ( BTC ). On June 10, B2BINPAY analysts shared their insights with crypto.news, the same day Ethereum reached a record level of staking balance. According to data from beaconcha.in, the amount of staked Ethereum hit an ATH of 34.65 million ETH, accounting for 28.7% of the total circulating supply. This milestone coincided with an 8% increase in ETH’s price on the same day. Simultaneously, Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded their 15th consecutive day of net inflows, totalling $837 million . You might also like: Ethereum June price prediction: Key levels to watch right now Institutions prepare to buy Ethereum, other altcoins B2BINPAY analysts say this data suggests institutions may be preparing to rotate capital from Bitcoin into Ethereum, a shift that could significantly increase ETH’s market dominance and support gains in other altcoins as well. “It’s also worth noting that just recently, on June 3, BlackRock sold $130.4 million worth of Bitcoin. Meanwhile, this week alone, we’ve seen over $100 million in ETH purchases, which is a strong signal that institutional investors may be preparing to rotate capital into Ethereum,” B2BINPAY analysts. You might also like: Bitcoin above $100k could spark institutional altcoin rally: MEXC In this context, Ethereum has the potential to build further bullish momentum, according to B2BINPAY. As long as ETH holds above the $2,320 support level, a breakdown below $2,000 is unlikely. However, further upside remains in focus. “If Ethereum follows a bullish path and breaks through the $2,793 resistance, a move toward the $3,500-$4,000 range becomes a very realistic scenario — and in our view, the more probable one”, B2BINPAY analysts. Ethereum offers staking income to holders, making it attractive to institutional investors. Unlike Bitcoin, which relies solely on price appreciation to generate returns, ETH provides yield, allowing investors to earn passive income without needing to sell their holdings.

2025-06-10T15:13:33,"Don’t Let the Cult of Price Hold Crypto Back","Cryptocurrency is too often viewed through the narrow lens of price. The dominant narrative surrounding Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the broader crypto market has become fixated on one idea: numbers go up. Did Bitcoin break $100,000? Did Ethereum double in a month? Is this altcoin going to the moon? Financial media, X pundits, and even crypto advocates routinely reduce an entire technological revolution to a speculative race to ever-higher prices. But this is like evaluating Apple or Nvidia solely by their stock movements while ignoring the iPhone or the GPUs powering AI infrastructure. It’s a superficial way of thinking — and in crypto, it’s also dangerous. In traditional markets, value is ultimately grounded in usage. The more products a company sells, the more revenue it generates. The more users it retains, the stronger its network effect. Apple isn’t a $3 trillion company just because its stock price went up; it’s because over a billion people use its ecosystem daily. Nvidia didn’t become a Wall Street darling by sheer momentum; it built the most essential chips of the AI age. Stock price follows product-market fit. In crypto, this principle is often inverted — price comes first, and everything else becomes secondary or optional. READ MORE: Ethereum Advocate William Mougayar to Lead Ecosystem's New Profile-Raising Initiative Nowhere is this philosophy more deeply ingrained than in what might be called Saylorism — the ideology promoted by MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor, the loudest evangelist for Bitcoin-as-collateral. Under this worldview, the core utility of Bitcoin isn’t transacting, building, or innovating — it’s simply holding. You buy Bitcoin, never sell, borrow against it, repeat. The usage is the hoarding. Bitcoin is not a currency or platform under Saylorism — it’s a speculative vault for value, designed to appreciate forever and justify more borrowing. In essence, every company becomes a leveraged Bitcoin fund, building its capital structure around a single bet: that the number always goes up. This is a radical departure from the logic that underpins healthy businesses. Traditional firms grow by creating value for others, through products, services, and infrastructure. Under Saylorism, value is internalized, circular, and ultimately recursive: you buy more Bitcoin because it’s going up, which makes it go up, which justifies buying more. It resembles a corporate Ponzi mindset, not in legal terms, but in structural dynamics, where external adoption matters less than internal leverage. The market doesn’t need new users, it just needs existing holders to keep believing. Compare that to Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, which has taken a different path. While Ethereum is also subject to the gravitational pull of price speculation, and no one would argue that “number goes up” doesn’t matter; its value proposition is fundamentally rooted in usage. ETH is not just a store of value; it is the fuel of an economy. It powers decentralized applications, settles billions in stablecoin transactions, tokenizes real-world assets, mints NFTs, facilitates decentralized finance, and supports governance. ETH has demand because the network has demand. The more people use Ethereum, the more ETH is needed. And the more ETH is burned through transaction fees, the more supply becomes constrained. Price here reflects activity, not just belief. This distinction is profound. Ethereum’s growth is tied to its functionality, to what it enables for users and developers. It resembles a traditional business more than a vault. It’s like Amazon in the early 2000s: difficult to value by conventional metrics but serving a growing ecosystem. The difference between these two models–Bitcoin as gold and Ethereum as infrastructure–has sparked endless debate over whether they’re even in competition. Some argue they’re entirely different species: Bitcoin is a monetary metal; Ethereum is a decentralized world computer, perhaps likened to digital oil. It’s fair to ask: what’s ultimately more valuable, the gold you keep or the dollar you spend? Bitcoin’s value depends on people holding it. Ethereum’s value depends on people using it. Both are succeeding, but the paths are not the same. If cryptocurrency is to evolve beyond its speculative adolescence, it must shift away from price obsession and toward utility obsession. This means asking harder questions: What is this protocol used for? Who depends on it? What problem does it solve? Valuation must come from participation, not just price action. A blockchain that delivers real-world utility for finance, identity, coordination, or computation deserves appreciation. But it must earn it through adoption, not ideology. What if, instead of competing, Bitcoin and Ethereum found common ground and worked together? That’s where the opportunity emerges: Ethereum serves as the most robust gateway for Bitcoin holders looking to access the broader world of decentralized finance. No network rivals Ethereum in terms of DeFi’s depth and maturity. By converting BTC into Ethereum-compatible assets, holders can engage in a dynamic ecosystem of lending, staking, and yield generation, turning dormant Bitcoin into active, value-producing capital. Platforms like Aave, Lido, Ethena, ether.fi, and Maker enable BTC to participate in ways that static holding simply can’t. The outcome? Mutual benefit: Ethereum attracts more liquidity, while Bitcoin gains much-needed utility. It’s a powerful synergy that amplifies the strengths of both networks. Cryptocurrency is not just a dumb financial asset It’s programmable money, digital property, frictionless transactions, decentralized coordination, and trustless finance. It’s a reimagining of the internet’s economic layer. But its long-term success depends on moving past the dopamine of daily price charts. Because in the end, the most valuable technologies aren’t the ones with the flashiest tickers; they’re the ones that get used. And usage, not hoarding, is what builds lasting value.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/06/10/dont-let-the-cult-of-price-hold-crypto-back,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Opinion|Opinion",cryptocompare
2025-06-10T15:10:56,"Altcoin Season Index Reveals: Bitcoin Dominance Reigning in Crypto Market","BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Index Reveals: Bitcoin Dominance Reigning in Crypto Market The pulse of the crypto market is constantly shifting, with periods where Bitcoin leads the charge and others where smaller alternative coins, or altcoins, surge. Understanding these cycles is crucial for any investor navigating the volatile world of cryptocurrency . A key metric for gauging the market’s temperature is the Altcoin Season Index . What is the Altcoin Season Index? Developed and tracked by cryptocurrency data platform CoinMarketCap (CMC), the Altcoin Season Index provides a snapshot of market sentiment by comparing the performance of top altcoins against Bitcoin over a specific period. It aims to answer the perennial question: Are we in Altcoin Season or Bitcoin Season ? Here’s how it generally works: It analyzes the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization on CoinMarketCap. Crucially, it excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens to focus purely on the performance of native assets. The comparison is made over the past 90 days. The index score ranges from 1 to 100. Altcoin Season vs. Bitcoin Season: Decoding the Index Score The index score directly correlates to whether the market is favoring altcoins or Bitcoin. The thresholds are quite clear: Altcoin Season: The index is typically 75 or higher. This signifies that 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. During Altcoin Season, investors often see significant gains in a wide range of altcoins. Bitcoin Season: The index is typically 25 or lower. This indicates that 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. In Bitcoin Season, Bitcoin tends to dominate the market, either rising faster than altcoins or holding value better during downturns. Scores between 25 and 75 often represent a transitional or neutral period, sometimes referred to as ‘Neither Season’ or a period of consolidation. Where Does the Crypto Market Stand Today? According to recent data, the Altcoin Season Index registered 29 as of 00:27 UTC on June 10. This figure is up slightly from the previous day but remains firmly within the ‘Bitcoin Season’ range. An index score of 29 strongly suggests that over the past three months, a significant majority of the top 100 altcoins have failed to keep pace with Bitcoin’s performance. This doesn’t necessarily mean altcoins are falling, but rather that Bitcoin is currently the dominant force driving the overall crypto market . What Does Bitcoin Season Mean for Your Portfolio? Being in Bitcoin Season has several implications for cryptocurrency investors: Potential Challenges: Many altcoins may experience slower growth or even declines relative to Bitcoin. Diversified portfolios heavily weighted towards altcoins might underperform a Bitcoin-focused strategy. Speculative altcoin plays might be riskier as capital flows tend to favor Bitcoin. Potential Opportunities: Focusing on Bitcoin could be a prudent strategy for capital preservation or steady growth. Opportunities might arise to accumulate promising altcoins at lower prices relative to Bitcoin. It can be a time to research and identify altcoins with strong fundamentals that might lead the next ‘Altcoin Season’. Understanding that the market is in Bitcoin Season allows investors to adjust their strategies, perhaps increasing their Bitcoin exposure or taking a more cautious approach to altcoin investments until the index begins to signal a shift. When Might We See Altcoin Season Return? Predicting the exact timing of market cycles is impossible, but several factors can contribute to a shift back towards Altcoin Season : A significant rally in Bitcoin that eventually sees profits ‘trickle down’ into altcoins. Major positive developments or upgrades within specific altcoin ecosystems (e.g., Ethereum’s developments). Increased institutional interest or adoption in specific altcoins beyond Bitcoin. A general increase in risk appetite across the broader financial markets. Monitoring the Altcoin Season Index regularly is key, as it provides a data-driven indicator of when the tides might be turning. Conclusion: Navigating the Seasons of the Crypto Market The Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool for understanding the current state of the crypto market . With the index currently sitting at 29, data suggests we are firmly in Bitcoin Season . This phase requires careful consideration of investment strategies, favoring prudence and perhaps a focus on Bitcoin or high-conviction altcoin projects. While the allure of massive altcoin gains is strong, recognizing the prevailing market cycle is essential for making informed decisions in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency .

2025-06-10T15:09:04,"Can Bitcoin (BTC) Hold $109,000 as Support? Price Analysis","In its second week of upside price action, and having poked its head above $110, Bitcoin bulls are hoping to hold the important $109,000 level. If they can accomplish this, the path up past the all-time high and into price discovery will be open. Against the backdrop of Tuesday’s announcement by the World Bank that global economic growth will slow down in 2025, Bitcoin is currently very close to its all-time high, with bulls attempting to make $109,000 the support platform for the next push higher. World Bank slower growth forecast Without mentioning President Trump by name, the World Bank released an economic growth forecast for 2025 that blamed “a substantial rise in trade barriers” for the downgrade that it predicts for 2025. Deleting 0.4% from its previous forecast, the World Bank expects global growth to slow to 2.3% in 2025, compared with the 2.8% that was achieved in 2024. It’s in this kind of economic environment that Bitcoin will be coming to the end of its 4-year cycle, if, of course, the World Bank forecast is accurate, although mounting global liquidity entering the monetary system might have some say in changing this forecast. With this in mind, it will be a tug-of-war between global liquidity boosting demand and easing financial conditions, while trade barriers, inflation, debt distress, and policy uncertainty weigh economies down. Is the $109,000 support already about to fail? Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart for $BTC shows that the $109,000 support could be breaking right now. The latest 4-hour candle is forging downward, and it remains to be seen whether the bulls can hold the price up. A factor that is going to be difficult for the bulls to fight against is that the Stochastic RSIs in the shorter-term time frames have their indicators turning down after reaching their apexes. This could mean a period of a few days of downward price momentum before things turn back around again in favour of the bulls. Source: TradingView The daily chart reveals that should the $109,000 support give way, the price could head back down to the important $106,000 horizontal level, or even to $105,000 which became an important level on the way up. At the bottom of the chart, the Relative Strength Index shows the indicator is angled down. Bulls will need to prevent it from crossing back down below the yellow moving average line. Weekly close is critical Source: TradingView The weekly chart illustrates the importance of these current levels. $109,000 has been returned to resistance (blue line) given the price is currently below. Of course, nothing is decided until the end of play on Sunday, when this level will be more definitively shown as support or resistance. There is a long way to go yet. The worst case scenario is if the $106,000 support level breaks. A candle closing underneath this level could mean the price needs to come lower still before finding solid support. Finally, it needs to be understood that there are likely going to be lots of fluctuations over the rest of this week. What really matters though is where things come to rest at the end of the week. This will decide if Bitcoin can continue into the next stage of its upward journey, or whether a correction might be necessary in order for the Stochastic RSIs to reset.

2025-06-10T15:00:51,"Crypto Fear Greed Index Hits 71: Decoding the ‘Greed’ Signal in the Market","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear Greed Index Hits 71: Decoding the ‘Greed’ Signal in the Market Ever wondered what the collective mood of the cryptocurrency market is? Is it a state of panic or euphoria? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index gives us a fascinating snapshot, and as of June 10, it’s firmly in the ‘Greed’ zone, standing at 71. This is a notable increase from the previous day and signals a significant shift in investor psychology. What Exactly is the Crypto Fear Greed Index? Think of the Crypto Fear Greed Index as a thermometer for market emotions. Developed by Alternative, this index compiles various data points to provide a single number between 0 and 100. A score closer to 0 indicates extreme fear, often seen during market crashes or periods of intense uncertainty. Conversely, a score closer to 100 signifies extreme greed, typically associated with strong bull runs or speculative bubbles. Why is this important? Legendary investor Warren Buffett famously advised, “Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.” The index aims to quantify these emotional states, helping investors understand if the market is currently operating out of irrational fear (potentially a buying opportunity) or irrational exuberance (potentially a time for caution). Decoding the ‘Greed Zone’: What Does 71 Mean? When the index climbs into the ‘Greed’ zone (typically above 50), it suggests that investors are becoming more optimistic and are more willing to buy assets, even at higher prices. A reading of 71 is firmly within the ‘Greed’ territory, indicating strong positive crypto market sentiment . This means: Investors are likely feeling confident. Buying pressure may be increasing. There’s a higher potential for the market to be overheated. Caution might be warranted, as markets driven purely by greed can be prone to sudden corrections. While a high index score isn’t a guaranteed sell signal, it serves as a yellow flag, reminding investors to assess their positions and risk tolerance. How is the Index Calculated? Key Factors The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t based on a single metric. It aggregates data from six different sources, each weighted differently to reflect its perceived impact on crypto market sentiment . Understanding these components provides deeper insight into the index’s reading: Volatility (25%): Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to average values. High volatility often indicates a fearful market. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Compares current volume and market momentum to recent averages. High buying volume in a positive market is a sign of greed. Social Media (15%): Analyzes posts on platforms like Twitter, looking for specific keywords and sentiment analysis to gauge public mood. Surveys (15%): Polls conducted weekly (though currently paused) ask investors about their market outlook. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Measures Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market cap. Increasing Bitcoin dominance can indicate fear (as investors flock to the perceived safety of BTC) or greed (if BTC is leading a strong rally). Google Trends (10%): Analyzes search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Rising search interest, especially for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” or “Bitcoin crash,” can signal fear, while terms like “buy Bitcoin” often indicate greed. The combination of these factors provides a holistic view of the prevailing market psychology. Understanding Bitcoin Dominance and Crypto Volatility in the Index Let’s look closer at two specific components: Bitcoin dominance and crypto volatility . Bitcoin dominance is a fascinating metric. When the market is uncertain or falling, investors often sell smaller altcoins and move funds back into Bitcoin, which is seen as less risky due to its larger market cap and longer history. This increases Bitcoin’s dominance. Conversely, during altcoin season or periods of high confidence, money flows into smaller caps, decreasing Bitcoin dominance. The index uses changes in dominance as a sentiment indicator. Crypto volatility is another key piece. High price swings, both up and down, contribute to volatility. While high volatility can be present in both fearful and greedy markets, the index specifically looks at sudden, large movements. Sharp drops increase fear, while parabolic rises often fuel greed. Actionable Insights: How Can You Use This Index? So, the index is at 71, signaling greed. What should you do? Here are some actionable insights: Exercise Caution: A high ‘Greed’ score suggests the market might be getting ahead of itself. Consider taking some profits, reducing your exposure, or tightening stop-loss orders. Avoid FOMO: The ‘Greed’ zone is where Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) is rampant. Don’t rush into buying assets just because prices are rising rapidly. Stick to your investment plan. Look for Divergences: Compare the index’s reading with other technical or fundamental analysis. Is the greed supported by strong fundamentals or just speculative hype? Prepare for Potential Reversals: Historically, extended periods in the ‘Extreme Greed’ zone (above 75-80) have often preceded market pullbacks. Be mentally prepared for this possibility. Conversely, if the index were in the ‘Fear’ zone (below 30), it might suggest a potential buying opportunity, but again, always combine it with other analysis. Challenges and Limitations of the Index While a useful tool, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t perfect and shouldn’t be your sole decision-making factor. Challenges include: It’s heavily weighted towards Bitcoin, potentially not fully reflecting sentiment for altcoins. The weighting of factors is subjective and determined by the creators. Market dynamics are constantly evolving, and the correlation between these factors and future price movements isn’t always consistent. Sentiment can change very quickly. Use the index as one data point among many in your analysis. Conclusion: Navigating the Waves of Sentiment The rise of the Crypto Fear Greed Index to 71 and its position in the ‘Greed’ zone tells us that optimism is currently high in the market. This positive crypto market sentiment is driven by factors like momentum, social media buzz, and how Bitcoin dominance and crypto volatility are playing out. While this indicates a strong market environment, it also serves as a crucial reminder to stay disciplined, avoid impulsive decisions driven by FOMO, and be prepared for potential shifts. By understanding the components and implications of the index, investors can gain a better perspective on the market’s emotional state and make more informed decisions.

He alluded to the 50EMA as the only thing holding ETH from witnessing this price surge, but suggested that it could change soon with a breakout on the horizon. Ethereum Price Eyes 38% Jump To $3,500 In an X post, Crypto Bullet predicted that the Ethereum price could record a 38% surge to $3,500. This came following as he highlighted the ongoing battle between ETH and the 50EMA, noting that this indicator was the only thing holding the altcoin back from a parabolic surge. The analyst added that on average, a breakout results in a 38% pump, which puts Ethereum exactly at $3,500. Related Reading: Pundit Says Do Not Ignore Ethereum Amid New All-Time Highs In Major Metric As NewsBTC reported, Crypto Bullet also recently predicted that the Ethereum price could rally to $3,300 as a Morningstar Candle pattern formed. Back then, he noted that ETH was facing tough resistance at $2,500 but affirmed that the resistance would be broken in due time. He indicated that a breakout from that resistance will usher in the rally to $3,300. The Ethereum price has now broken above the $2,500 resistance, which provides a bullish outlook for the largest altcoin by market cap. Based on Crypto Bullet’s prediction, a rally to $3,300 may already be underway, which could then lead ETH to the $3,500 target. In a more recent X post, the crypto analyst commented on the recent break above $2,500. He stated that the Ethereum price is now trying to break the 200-day MA, which is between $3,000 and $3,300, for the fifth time. He indicated that a breakout above the range is likely to happen on this fifth attempt. His accompanying showed that ETH could rally to the $4,000 level if a successful breakout occurs. ETH About To Begin A New Bull Run Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade predicted that another bull run is about to start for the Ethereum price. He noted that ETH’s daily candle closed above the resistance level at $2,650 yesterday and also opened above this resistance level today. The analyst added that ETH is now moving above it, which signals the start of a new bull run. Related Reading: FTX Repayments About To Dump $5B On The Market, How Will Bitcoin And Ethereum React? His accompanying chart showed that the Ethereum price is breaking out of an ascending triangle, which could send the altcoin above the psychological $3,000 level. Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto also declared that Ethereum’s breakout will be huge, with ETH still maintaining its current range between $2,400 and $2,600. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $2,670, up over 7% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

2025-06-10T15:00:00,"Only 6 media now drive nearly all of LATAM’s crypto traffic — Outset PR signals the shift, but what’s behind it?","As Web3 ideals gain traction across Latin America, the media landscape around them is showing early signs of narrowing, not broadening, and that contrast is hard to ignore. Six crypto-native outlets dominate the region’s news ecosystem, according to a new report from Outset PR , the agency that knows traffic and trust aren’t the same, and plans around that. As the rest of the media landscape shrinks, questions are mounting: who controls the crypto conversation in Latin America, what’s at stake, and how did a decentralized movement end up with a media landscape that looks increasingly centralized? Outset PR’s findings show that just six sites account for nearly 70% of all traffic across 38 crypto-only publications in Latin America. Traffic distribution across top crypto-native outlets in LATAM, Q1 2025 | Source: Outset PR This report segmented the rest of the field into two additional tiers. The next seven outlets reached between 130K and 270K monthly visits. Together, they captured around 22.9% of traffic. The remaining 24 crypto sites made up just 8% of total traffic, with many struggling to cross 10,000 monthly visits. The visibility cliff between tiers was steep — and it shows how difficult it is for new players to break through. Most might view the large amount of media power spread across a small handful of outlets as a sign of media maturity. This makes sense: the readers have decided who they want to follow. The strong survived, and the rest failed. But is this centralization by design, or just the byproduct of bigger forces? There’s no indication in Outset PR’s report of any coordinated push to dominate crypto media. But the traffic data they’ve been publishing — including on their X profile — points to something more structural: survival shaped by algorithm changes, tightening ad budgets, and shifting reader habits. In that environment, only a few outlets had the resources, SEO muscle, or extra backing to hold on, let alone grow. What happened to the open frontier? Crypto was meant as an alternative to all forms of centralized control. But as Latin America’s crypto economy has grown, so too has the pull toward media centralization. A handful of early movers, some backed by large newsgroups, others boosted by international reach, dominate search rankings, social traffic, and key reporter relationships. That dominance has made them unofficial gatekeepers of crypto narratives across the region. The numbers back it up: Outset PR tracked 55 active crypto and crypto-adjacent newsrooms across LATAM in the first quarter. Of those, 73% lost traffic. Outset PR tracked a 73% traffic drop across the majority of LATAM outlets in Q1 2025 | Source: Outset PR Several previously relevant outlets, such as bitcoinmexico.net and latamblockchain.com, are now defunct, dormant, or just irrelevant. Only 12 outlets posted traffic growth in February, but by the end of the quarter, that number had doubled. Among those that demonstrated a fighting chance, the odds are stacked against them, as most struggle to cross 300,000 monthly visits. Even well-performing portals like DiarioBitcoin or CriptoTendencia fall far short of the audience reach commanded by general-interest finance sites like Ámbito or InfoMoney. The playing field is not just uneven, it’s structurally tilted toward high-traffic incumbents. And then there’s the algorithm. Google’s March core update quietly redrew the map for many LATAM outlets, rewarding a handful of technically resilient sites while pushing others further into the shadows. For smaller crypto-native players, it wasn’t just about content — it was about losing visibility in the feeds where most discovery still happens. The result? Fewer entry points, fewer voices, and a media landscape that’s starting to look a lot less decentralized than the tech it’s meant to cover. Who really shapes the story? With six outlets dominating coverage, their editorial desks and a few reporters dictate what the LATAM crypto community sees and hears. Whether it’s a new token launch, a DeFi protocol , or a legal dispute, visibility is filtered through the priorities of just a few teams. In Brazil , fintech company Méliuz announced plans to raise $26.4 million to expand its Bitcoin holdings. This news was picked up by Reuters . In Chile, stablecoin issuer giant Tether invested in the crypto exchange Orionx to enhance digital asset adoption across Latin America. CoinDesk picked up this story. These stories traveled far. But for smaller projects that don’t get picked up by the dominant LATAM media players, visibility is a constant uphill battle. The consequence? Less space for early-stage builders, and fewer chances for regional innovation to break through. Sponsored content, undisclosed brand partnerships, and promotional articles from projects that can’t secure organic coverage won’t solve anything. The slightest sign of bias will be easily detected. This public relations strategy of ‘pay to play’ might have worked five years ago. However, the crypto community has evolved to look beyond noise and pay attention to real stories from real projects written by real journalists. Outset PR’s report doesn’t just diagnose the problem, it offers a call to action. For startups, it means resetting expectations based on realities. For media strategists, it means looking beyond surface-level metrics and investing in outlets that still offer real reach. And for the rest of the crypto community, it means giving new and independent voices a chance to thrive in a market that is certainly large enough for everyone. Decentralization isn’t just a technical goal, it’s a media challenge too. The complete data set and visual analysis from Outset PR’s LATAM crypto media Q1 report is published on their blog for anyone who wants to explore further.",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/only-6-media-now-drive-nearly-all-of-latams-crypto-traffic/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|RESEARCH","Partner Content|research",cryptocompare

2025-06-10T15:00:00,"Could Ripple (XRP) ETF Approval Trigger XRP Rally to $5 or Will New Altcoin Rival Below $0.05 Get There Faster?","Bullish sentiment is growing on the back of renewed ETF approval speculation and rising institutional demand, with Ripple (XRP) holding above the critical $2.19 level. As one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in, XRP’s utility in real-time cross-border settlements continues to strengthen its long-term value proposition. Traders are now watching a breakout zone that could open the door to a $5 XRP rally, especially if a spot XRP ETF gains regulatory greenlight. Still, while XRP maintains its blue-chip status, momentum is quickly building behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new altcoin trading under $0.05, now touted as the next big crypto thanks to its viral growth potential and DeFi utility. The official presale of Mutuum Finance has priced the token at $0.03 in Phase 5, closer to a Phase 6 price of $0.035 per MUTM. Already having achieved a 200% growth from when it was first launched in presale, MUTM will officially go live at $0.06, giving current customers a minimum 100% return on investment (2x ROI). XRP Price Targets $5 as ETF Hype Builds Currently, XRP is at $2.19 and is holding its price above $2 as investors await the possible approval of an ETF. Analysts are hopeful that after an announcement from the SEC in mid-June and an approved XRP spot ETF, the token could hit $5 by the end of 2025. XRP might grow in a way similar to what Bitcoin did when its ETF was approved in 2024, so it is a good investment currently. It’s clear from technical indicators that XRP is being considered by traders who are bullish about the leading crypto. Still, altcoins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are slowly gaining popularity as they offer big returns for investors. Presale Picks Up Speed: Mutuum Finance Takes the Lead Mutuum Finance continues to gather momentum as Phase 4 of its presale has sold out ahead of schedule. In Phase 5 currently, tokens are set at $0.03, giving investors a 16.67% return right off the bat once the price increases in the next round. The presale has already raised over $10.3 million and attracted more than 11,800 investors. With demand on the rise and sound fundamentals, most are hoping for even greater returns after launch, as MUTM makes a case for itself as among the top altcoins to invest in 2025. Stablecoin Launch & Certik Audit Build Investor Trust Mutuum Finance is releasing a dollar-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum. Compared to algorithmic stablecoins, Mutuum’s stablecoin is properly collateralized, so it maintains a constant price and user trust. The smart contracts of the platform have been extensively audited by Certik. This finished audit further strengthens the platform’s preference for transparency, security, and long-term sustainability. Early Investors Reward With greater growth Mutuum Finance doesn’t forget its early supporters and continues rewarding them. 10 will be chosen to share a $100,000 giveaway each getting $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens for cheering the project in the beginning. The Buy-and-Distribute system, robust security of its coin and recognized audit credentials all make Mutuum Finance an interesting combination of progress, proven safety and active community involvement. For bold investors, it allows them to support a DeFi project as it is starting out in the field. XRP may hit $5 with ETF approval, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rising faster. At $0.03 now and launching at $0.06, it offers 2x ROI. With $10.3M raised, 11,800+ investors, and Certik-audited security, MUTM is a top DeFi pick. Join the presale.

2025-06-10T14:58:08,"Analysts Unite: ""The Big Day Has Come for Ethereum, Explosive Rally Is Imminent!""","The largest altcoin Ethreum (ETH) performed poorly against Bitcoin (BTC) and failed to deliver the long-awaited performance. However, analyst Peter Brandt, who has 50 years of experience, said that now is the time for Ethereum. Arguing that Ethereum may be on the verge of a breakout at this point, Peter Brandt pointed out in the chart he shared that ETH has moved from a descending channel to a symmetrical triangle formation. The symmetrical triangle formation that Brandt highlighted usually signals consolidation before a significant breakout. Brandt, who shares the caption “Every dog has its day – woof woof ETH,” argues that now could be Ethereum's time to shine after falling far behind Bitcoin, which he has been criticizing. However, Brandt has often stated that as a trader he prefers Bitcoin and does not care about Ethereum. Data Points to a Rise in Ethereum! Apart from Peter Brandt, Singapore-based analysis firm QCP Capital also published a positive report for Ethereum. At this point, QCP analysts said that Ethereum bullish momentum is strengthening. Analysts stated that the macro environment is also favorable for the rise of Ethereum, and that they expect the stablecoin law called GENIUS to pass and that this law increases the potential for the rise in Ethereum. “Ethereum is quietly regaining its dominance and its narrative is strengthening. There is an increase in implied volatility. Short-term ATM volatility has entered the 70% range. There is an increase in call options. Perpetual futures funding rates have increased. All of these indicators have strengthened the upward momentum. Additionally, the flow in the Ethereum spot ETF is also positive, indicating increasing interest from institutional investors. Finally, the US stablecoin bill called GENIUS is expected to pass. This further increases the potential upside for Ethereum.” *This is not investment advice.
