2025-06-10T09:55:19,"Plasma raises $500m in oversubscribed XPL token sale for stablecoin-focused blockchain","Plasma, a startup focused on stablecoins, raised an impressive $500 million in its latest public token offering, far surpassing its initial target. On June 9, Plasma announced on X that its public token sale for XPL sold out in just 40 minutes. The team initially planned to raise $50 million but had to revise it twice, first to $250 million, then to $500 million, after overwhelming interest from buyers. In total, more than 1,100 wallets participated in the token sale, with a median deposit of approximately $35,000 per wallet. The XPL token sale accounted for 10% of Plasma’s total token supply, implying a fully diluted valuation of $500 million, consistent with the valuation from its earlier equity round, which was backed by Founders Fund. Participants in the sale were required to deposit stablecoins into a vault hosted on Ethereum, with support for USDT, USDC, USDS, and DAI. Unlike traditional first-come-first-served token launches, Plasma implemented a time-weighted deposit model that rewarded early and longer-held deposits with a greater allocation of tokens. All deposits were processed through smart contracts audited by Veda, a well-regarded blockchain infrastructure firm. At the time of the sale, Veda’s audited contracts managed over $2.6 billion in total value locked, lending credibility and security assurances to the process.

Plasma is a blockchain designed to enable fast, scalable, and low-fee stablecoin transactions. It is a Bitcoin sidechain that is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, which allows it to support a wide range of decentralized finance applications while benefiting from Bitcoin’s robust security layer. The XPL token will function as the native cryptocurrency of Plasma’s planned blockchain. By optimizing for stablecoin transactions and enabling zero-fee USDT transfers, Plasma wants to position itself as a high-performance settlement layer for payments, remittances, and DeFi services. Plasma has steadily drawn the attention of top-tier investors since late 2024, including Founders Fund, Framework Ventures, and Bitfinex . The project kicked off with a $3.5 million seed round in October 2024, followed by a $20 million Series A in February 2025, led by Framework and joined by Nomura, Bybit, and 6th Man Ventures. Plasma’s token sale comes at a time when major jurisdictions across the globe are advancing stablecoin regulation. For instance, regulators in the United States recently moved forward with the GENIUS Act , a bipartisan proposal that would establish a federal framework for payment stablecoins. Meanwhile, last year, the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets framework (MICA) came into force, with stablecoin provisions taking effect in June 2024 and full implementation coming into effect by the end of December.

2025-06-10T09:50:21,"US Stock Markets Rise: Unlocking Critical Insights for Crypto","BitcoinWorld US Stock Markets Rise: Unlocking Critical Insights for Crypto Hey there, fellow market watchers! The financial world is always buzzing, and today, we’re kicking things off with a look at traditional finance. Specifically, the US stock markets have opened higher today. Now, you might be thinking, “Why should I care about stocks if I’m focused on crypto?” Great question! While crypto marches to its own beat in many ways, understanding broader stock market trends can offer valuable context for navigating the volatile world of digital assets. Let’s dive into what’s happening and why it matters. Understanding the US Stock Markets Open At the start of trading today, major indices in the United States showed positive momentum. Here’s a quick look at the numbers: Index Change S&P500 +0.07% NASDAQ +0.08% Dow Jones Industrial Average (Dow) +0.06% These are modest gains, certainly not earth-shattering moves, but they signal a positive start to the trading day in traditional finance. The S&P 500 is often seen as a benchmark for the overall health of large U.S. companies, the NASDAQ is heavily weighted towards technology stocks, and the Dow represents 30 large, publicly owned companies. Exploring Crypto Market Correlation So, how does a slightly higher open in the US stock markets potentially relate to the crypto world? This is where the concept of crypto market correlation comes into play. In recent years, especially as cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have gained more mainstream attention and institutional investment, their price movements have sometimes shown a correlation with traditional risk assets, particularly tech stocks represented by the NASDAQ. Here’s the thinking: Risk-On Sentiment: When investors feel confident about the economy and are willing to take on more risk, they often invest in assets perceived as having higher growth potential, such as technology stocks and, increasingly, cryptocurrencies. A positive open in stocks can sometimes reflect or contribute to this ‘risk-on’ sentiment. Macroeconomic Factors: The same big economic news that moves stocks (like inflation data, interest rate decisions, employment numbers) also influences investor sentiment and capital flows globally, impacting crypto markets as well. Investor Overlap: As more traditional investors allocate a portion of their portfolios to crypto, their decisions might be influenced by their overall market outlook, which is heavily tied to stock market performance. It’s important to note that this correlation isn’t always perfect or consistent. Crypto markets have unique drivers like regulatory news, technological developments (protocol upgrades, new projects), and adoption rates that can cause them to diverge significantly from stock market trends. What’s the Potential Bitcoin Price Impact? Given the potential crypto market correlation , what could a positive open in the US stock markets mean for the Bitcoin price impact ? While a 0.06-0.08% rise in stocks is tiny by Bitcoin’s volatile standards, it contributes to the overall market sentiment picture. Think of it this way: A positive stock open adds a small green signal to the global financial dashboard. If this positive trend continues throughout the day and is driven by strong underlying economic signals, it could reinforce ‘risk-on’ behavior that might spill over into demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Conversely, if stocks had opened sharply lower, it might signal broad risk aversion, potentially putting downward pressure on crypto prices. However, it’s crucial not to overstate the immediate Bitcoin price impact of such small stock movements. Bitcoin and the broader crypto market are known for their significant intraday volatility, often moving several percentage points in either direction based on crypto-specific news or market dynamics that have nothing to do with stocks. Analyzing Broader Stock Market Trends for Crypto Clues Beyond the daily open, keeping an eye on general stock market trends can provide valuable insights for crypto investors. Are tech stocks leading the way? Is the market reacting positively or negatively to inflation reports? These larger trends often reflect the prevailing market sentiment regarding economic growth, inflation, and the future path of monetary policy – all factors that have shown a clear influence on crypto markets over time. For instance: When central banks signal tighter monetary policy (raising interest rates, reducing stimulus), both stocks (especially growth stocks) and crypto have historically faced headwinds as investors become more cautious. When inflation appears to be cooling, it can sometimes lead to a rally in both asset classes as the pressure for aggressive rate hikes eases. Monitoring how traditional markets digest major economic news can offer a sneak peek into the macro environment that crypto also operates within. It’s like checking the weather report for the broader financial climate. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what can you actually do with this information about US stock markets and their slight rise today? Here are a few actionable insights: Use it as a Sentiment Indicator: View the stock market’s open and daily trend as one data point among many for assessing overall market sentiment . A strong upward trend in stocks, particularly tech, might suggest a favorable environment for risk assets, including crypto. Observe Correlation (But Don’t Rely Solely On It): Pay attention to whether crypto is following stock movements on a given day or week. Is the crypto market correlation strong or weak? This can help you understand the current market dynamics, but always remember that crypto can decouple rapidly. Understand the Macro Drivers: Look into *why* stocks are moving. Is there specific economic news? This underlying reason is often more important than the movement itself, as those macro factors directly influence crypto as well. Manage Expectations: Don’t expect a 0.07% rise in the S&P 500 to cause Bitcoin to jump 5%. Stock market moves are typically much smaller in percentage terms than crypto moves. Use stock market data for context, not as a direct price predictor. The benefit here isn’t a guaranteed trading signal, but rather a more holistic understanding of the financial landscape. Challenges include the imperfect nature of the correlation and the need to filter out the noise – small daily stock moves are less significant than major trend shifts or reactions to big economic events. In Conclusion: A Piece of the Puzzle Today’s higher open in the US stock markets is a small positive signal from the traditional financial world. While the direct, immediate Bitcoin price impact of such minor moves is limited, monitoring broader stock market trends and understanding their potential crypto market correlation offers valuable context for crypto investors. It helps us gauge overall market sentiment and understand the macroeconomic forces at play. Remember, successful navigation of the crypto market involves looking at a wide range of indicators, from on-chain data and regulatory news to global economic signals, including those from traditional markets like stocks.

2025-06-10T09:37:20,"Arthur Hayes predicts a new breakout for Hyperliquid (HYPE)","Hyperliquid (HYPE) fulfilled the expectations of rallying, as it reached a new peak for 2025. Crypto influencer Arthur Hayes predicts an even larger breakout for the DEX token. Hyperliquid (HYPE) is trending again, as its native token rallied to a new peak for 2025. The breakout happens just a day after whales accumulation was noticed, as Hyperliquid continues to draw attention and new traders. Arthur Hayes, crypto influencer and the co-founder of BitMex, expects a rally above $40 with the unpredictability of price discovery. HYPE reached $39.18, adding over 10% for the past day, after a period of almost non-stop recovery since the lows of $12 in April. Traders are already putting higher targets on HYPE, due to the long period of preparation and accumulation. HYPE broke out as trading volumes increased over 137% in the past day, up to $1.7B. The HYPE rally liquidated $1.44M in short positions. HYPE rallied above $39, expecting an even bigger breakout on increased DEX activity and signs of whales accumulation. | Source: CoinGecko Currently, HYPE long and short positions are nearly equally balanced, with some drift toward more shorting, as HYPE may backtrack to a lower range in the short term. HYPE remains unpredictable as it shifts toward a new price range. Traders are split between an irrational rally similar to meme tokens, and an opportunity to short an over-valued asset. HYPE is still trading neutral, not showing signs of being overbought. The asset is not even among the hottest trending crypto, leading to predictions for a more gradual and extended rally. Attempts at short liquidation may also lead to more near-vertical gains in a short time span. Hyperliquid brought out HYPE whales HYPE remains risky as 71.91% of trades are on-chain, locked in the native Hyperliquid ecosystem. The concentrated liquidity has brought out aggressive whales, who have engaged with token during previous rallies. A whale deposited $9.975M $USDC into #HyperLiquid and bought 259,367 $HYPE at a price of $38.46. Previously, the whale has made over $10M in $HYPE trades. https://t.co/iKAuQmwO0d pic.twitter.com/VkKsVWaQgg — Onchain Lens (@OnchainLens) June 10, 2025 Whales are also coming from external ecosystems, even using Solana’s Kamino Lend to borrow USDC and deposit it to Hyperliquid. HYPE was bought near its peak price in the past 24 hours, and some of the whales staked the tokens, easing the potential selling pressure. The current Hyperliquid activity may repeat the peak statistics of May, with record volumes and over $70M in generated fees. However, in the past weeks, liquidations slowed down as traders became more strategic. Hyperliquid remains one of the few exchanges to offer up to 40X leverage for BTC. Most of the open interest on Hyperliquid is still for BTC and ETH. However, trading other tokens is accelerating, including the native token. The DEX currently holds $558M in liquidity locked, expecting more significant expansion to compete with older DEXs and even centralized markets. Some of the engagement with HYPE may be organic, due to the ability to tap into the new BTC bullish trend. However, there are also rumors of an eventual second airdrop, which may drive additional activity and social media posting. An additional source of interest came from the trade moves of James Wynn with high-value positions which were publicly liquidated. Recently, Wynn stated he is back on Hyperliquid with an unknown account, continuing his strategy of longing BTC with high leverage.

US Senate Republican Leader John Thune has introduced a motion to end debate on the GENIUS Act, with a vote scheduled for Wednesday, Bloomberg reported. Accordingly, on Monday, Senator John Thune introduced a closing motion on the GENIUS Act, advancing the legislation toward a final vote. The relevant vote will be held this week and the bill needs 60 votes to be passed. After passing the Senate, it will go to the House of Representatives.

2025-06-10T09:30:29,"Solana Triangle Formation Breakout Targets Rally To $164 – Is A Recovery Around The Corner?","Solana (SOL) has recovered from the recent market pullback after bouncing from its local bottom. Amid its recent breakout from a bullish formation, some market watchers suggest that the cryptocurrency could recover its start-of-year glory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly Chart Flexes Strength—Is The Moonshot Just Getting Started? Solana Breakout Eyes $164 Solana is recording a 2.45% surge in the weekly timeframe after recovering from its recent drop to the $140 area. The altcoin has seen a significant recovery from its multi-month downtrend, which led the token to hit a 14-month low of $95 during the early April retraces. However, SOL lost the $160 area amid the recent market corrections, dipping 11% in one week. Over the weekend, its price bounced nearly 10%, reclaiming the $150 level as support and forming an ascending triangle pattern. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted the 3-day formation in Solana’s chart, suggesting a potential 6% jump to its recently lost support level. According to the post, the cryptocurrency broke out of the triangle formation on Monday after reclaiming the $155 area. A retest and breakout confirmation could propel Solana to the $164 barrier, which has not been seen in two weeks. Analyst CW noted that if SOL breaks through the selling barrier around the $160 level, “the previous price will recover quickly,” as reclaiming this level could send the price straight to the $180 area. Notably, the altcoin’s next significant selling wall is around the $180 resistance, which it has been unable to reclaim despite touching a $187 three-month high during the recent market rally. Recovering this key barrier could also push SOL’s price toward the $200 mark, enabling a rally to new highs. However, failing to hold the current levels could send the cryptocurrency’s price back toward the $142 buying wall, which served as support last week, or even the $135 level, where the next buy wall sits. SOL Preparing To Climb Higher? Market watcher Jeremy pointed out that Solana is “finally breaking out from this downtrend consolidation.” Per the post, the cryptocurrency has been consolidating in a descending channel since late May, hovering between the $140-$187 price range. Throughout this period, SOL’s price moved from the $180 mark toward the $144 support. Nonetheless, it broke out of the two-week descending channel after reclaiming the $155 level. Jeremy suggested that Solana’s price could “actually climb higher” if global conflicts and political disputes, like the Trump-Musk online feud, don’t continue to affect the market, concluding that “1 SOL = $300 is just a matter of time.” Related Reading: Pundit Says Do Not Ignore Ethereum Amid New All-Time Highs In Major Metric Meanwhile, crypto trader Coinvo recently affirmed that SOL’s bottom “is finally in,” highlighting a potential bullish megaphone pattern in SOL’s chart. The 18-month pattern shows that the fourth wave bounced from the formation’s lower boundary during the April pullback. This could signal a potential surge to the upper boundary, around the all-time high (ATH) levels, during the fifth wave. A breakout above the pattern’s resistance line could propel Solana to new highs As of this writing, Solana trades at $156, a 1.88% increase in the daily timeframe.

2025-06-10T09:30:01,"Bitcoin Skyrockets Past $108,000 Amid US-China Tariff Discussions","The market’s leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), experienced a notable spike on Monday, surging past the $108,000 mark after a period of consolidation between $100,000 and $106,000 for the past week. This surge comes as key officials from the United States and China prepare for critical trade negotiations in London, aimed at addressing ongoing tensions and salvaging “a fragile trade agreement.” US-China Trade Talks Spark Investor Optimism The cryptocurrency gained 2% on Monday, briefly touching a peak of $108,900 before settling back slightly. This uptick reflects growing investor optimism regarding the potential resolution of trade disputes between the US and China, one of its largest trading partners. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and China’s Vice Premier for Economic Policy, He Lifeng, are set to lead their respective delegations in discussions that began Monday and are expected to continue into Tuesday, as reported by Fortune. Related Reading: Pundit Says Do Not Ignore Ethereum Amid New All-Time Highs In Major Metric These negotiations are part of President Donald Trump’s broader strategy to compel US trading partners to meet various demands, often through the threat of imposing significant tariffs on imports. Following the announcement of a sweeping tariff policy in April, which impacted nearly all American trading partners, Trump authorized a 90-day pause for negotiations. However, this pause did not apply to tariffs on China, which were escalated to 145%. Trade Talks Resuming As Bitcoin Prices Rise The heightened tensions between the two nations had previously led to a significant drop in Bitcoin’s value, reaching a yearly low of $75,000 as fears of a trade war drove investors away from American markets. However, optimism returned following a summit in Geneva last month, where Trump announced a temporary agreement that would lower tariffs and facilitate further discussions. In the wake of this news, Bitcoin surged to an all-time high of $111,800 on May 22. Yet, the truce was short-lived. Trump claimed that China had violated the agreement over a dispute regarding exports of rare earth magnets. On May 30, he expressed his frustrations on Truth Social, stating, “China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!” In an urgent attempt to salvage the deteriorating trade deal, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping held a phone call last week, their first in months. Following this 90-minute conversation, it was announced that senior officials from both countries would meet in London this week to resume negotiations. In addition to trade-related factors, Bitcoin’s recent price surge may also be influenced by increased activity in the cryptocurrency initial public offering (IPO) market. Wave Of Crypto IPO Activity Last week, the stablecoin giant Circle made its public debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), with its shares soaring by over 168%, jumping from an initial price of $31 to $69 on the first day of trading. Additionally, Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins, filed for an initial public offering, further demonstrating the crypto industry’s growing connection to traditional finance. Related Reading: Dogecoin Is Going To $1 With The ‘Next Impulse’, Analyst Predicts “While the IPO excitement may be short-lived, the long-term positioning of institutional investors suggests a bullish outlook for Bitcoin’s performance through 2025,” remarked David Siemer, CEO of Wave Digital Assets, in an interview with Fortune. When writing, BTC trades at $108,670, recording gains of 6% in the monthly time frame, little over 2.7% from its record high of $111,8000 reached in May.

2025-06-10T09:20:43,"Canary Capital Moves Toward Potential Injective-Based ETF in the US","Canary Capital has taken its first official step toward launching a U.S.-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) centered on the Injective (INJ) token. A trust named “Canary Staked INJ ETF” was registered on June 10 with the Delaware Division of Corporations, a typical early move for firms looking to eventually list an ETF tied to a digital asset. While the creation of a Delaware trust does not guarantee an ETF launch, it is often the first step before firms file for regulatory approval with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Several recent crypto ETF launches have followed this path, including products tracking Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other blockchain tokens. There are no public details yet on the structure of the INJ ETF, but the move follows Canary Capital’s earlier filing in April for an ETF involving Tron (TRX) , which aimed to generate yield by staking the token. That structure would allow the fund to earn staking rewards while holding and locking a portion of the asset to help secure the blockchain. INJ Token Sees Boost Amid ETF Speculation News of the Delaware trust helped push the price of the INJ token up 3.7% in the last 24 hours, adding to a more than 10.5% gain over the past week. The token’s rally comes alongside a modest increase in user activity and transactions on the Injective blockchain, according to data from DappRadar. The Injective network positions itself as a layer-1 blockchain optimized for artificial intelligence agents and the tokenization of real-world assets, including traditional stocks. These sectors are gaining interest as the crypto industry continues to seek practical applications that go beyond speculative trading. Asset manager 21Shares has already launched a similar product in Europe, offering an exchange-traded product (ETP) that tracks INJ and incorporates staking rewards. Canary Capital’s move appears aimed at bringing a comparable product to U.S. markets. Regulatory Hurdles Remain for Staking-Based ETFs Despite growing interest, the SEC remains cautious about ETFs tied to staked cryptocurrencies . Last month, the regulator expressed concerns about similar proposals from REX Financial and Osprey Funds, suggesting they may not meet the legal criteria required to qualify as investment companies. Still, optimism remains. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas noted that REX’s legal team believes the issue can be resolved, hinting that staking ETFs could eventually gain approval if structured properly. Canary Capital has not yet responded to requests for comment on its INJ trust filing.

In a CNBC interview, Kolanovic says a correction could be incoming for the US stock market amid a loss of momentum by stocks such as the electric carmaker Tesla and the analytics software firm Palantir Technologies. The analyst also warns that the equities are trading close to record high levels, but America is still staring at the same issues that triggered a stock market correction earlier this year. “That [loss of momentum] could be a catalyst for a bit of a correction because close to all-time highs, but we still have all the problems. We have a trade war, we had a sort of signs of economic slowdown, valuations are back to highs. So that’s sort of what I’m kind of expecting – a little bit of a pullback here.” Kolanovic believes that a potential pullback could ultimately reward patient investors, provided the likelihood of a US economic contraction does not significantly increase. “There are some cheap aspects of US markets as well, and maybe wait for that garden variety sell-off that can be maybe 5%, 10%. And if we still don’t have the recession probability shooting up, then it’s a buy opportunity. But I would keep an open mind that maybe at that point there is increased probability of recession and maybe even that 5% is not a buy at that [point].” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-10T09:10:54,"Crypto analyst predicts a new all-time high for Bitcoin","Bitcoin ( BTC ) has surged past the $110,000 mark following a critical breakout above $108,900, positioning itself for a potential new all-time high of $130,000. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe predicted on June 10 that the current phase is likely a short consolidation period, a common pattern before increased upward momentum. The ideal buying range as BTC prepares for what could be another historic run, van de Poppe suggests, sits around $107,000 to $108,000. Bitcoin’s 14-day relative strength index ( RSI ) currently sits at 6771, which is bullish but not yet overheated. Michaël van de Poppe’s BTC analysis. Source: X If the RSI retests 75 by the end of the month, another analyst PlanB suggests, the June closing price for BTC would be ~$130,000, agreeing with van de Poppe’s predictions. Bitcoin price forecast The rally can apparently be chalked up to a number of reasons, most notably a sharp technical breakout. Namely, BTC reclaimed the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $109,248 after bouncing off key support near $100,436. Institutional demand likewise remains strong, with spot exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) and corporate treasuries continuing to absorb supply. Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) (NASDAQ: MSTR ), for example, has bought over 1000 BTC this week, worth ~$110.2 million in total. Moreover, many investors are optimistic about the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decision on Federal Funds Rate (FED) cuts, pending June 18. While prolonged high rates might weigh on risk assets, BTC’s correlation with global liquidity could provide some much needed counterbalance. All in all, with strong institutional inflows, bullish investor sentiment, and solid technical signals, a big move might very well be on the horizon. Whether that will include the $130,000 target, however, remains to be seen.

2025-06-10T09:06:54,"Interview: Crypto now a ‘strategic asset,’ not a ‘speculative play,’ says BlockTrust CEO Jonathan Rose amidst IRA surge","As cryptocurrencies continue to mature as an asset class, more investors are exploring ways to integrate them into long-term financial planning—particularly through retirement accounts. Many investors are turning to crypto IRAs as a way to combine the tax benefits of retirement accounts with the growth potential and diversification offered by digital assets. However, the approach isn’t without risk. Cryptocurrency’s inherent volatility can significantly affect portfolio values, which is especially concerning for those nearing retirement, who may not have time to recover from sharp market downturns. To understand how this evolving landscape is shaping investor behaviour, Invezz spoke with Jonathan Rose, CEO of BlockTrust IRA, a platform that helps investors build diversified, crypto-inclusive retirement portfolios through AI-powered managed accounts and self-directed IRAs. The platform has onboarded nearly $50 million in managed IRAs since the launch of its Managed Crypto IRA 3 months ago, apart from the user base of investors who wish to self-manage on the BlockTrust platform due to our industry low trading fees, Rose shared, adding that the average IRA transfer or 401k rollover is around $50,000. Rose is confident BlockTrust will reach its $100 million AUM target by year-end, citing strong demand, a streamlined onboarding process, and increasing referrals. He also drew a clear distinction between crypto IRAs and spot Bitcoin ETFs. Rose adds: ETFs are passive, one-size-fits-all products. We offer an actively managed, tax-advantaged way to capture the upside of a digital asset boom and mitigate downside risk. Excerpts from an emailed interaction: A ‘major shift’ in retirement thinking Invezz : What trends are you seeing in investor demand for crypto in retirement accounts today? We’re seeing a major shift in how Americans think about retirement investing. More investors are realizing that traditional portfolios aren’t enough to keep pace with inflation, global instability, or tech disruption. Crypto is no longer just a speculative play; it’s becoming a strategic asset. At BlockTrust, we’ve seen significant growth in IRA rollovers from people who want exposure to digital assets but also want a managed, secure, and tax-advantaged way to do it. Volatility: a feature, not a bug Invezz : You’ve stated that BlockTrust embraces crypto market volatility to generate returns. How does your quantitative trading strategy mitigate the inherent risks of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum? Volatility is often seen as a downside in crypto. For us, it’s an opportunity. Our AI-driven trading algorithm is designed to thrive in dynamic markets by identifying trends and capitalizing on momentum shifts across Bitcoin and Ethereum. We don’t just hold Bitcoin and hope it goes up. We use data and cutting-edge technology to actively manage positions, hedge against downside, and protect capital. Risk isn’t eliminated; however we help our clients navigate that risk in a strategic way. A political tailwind from Washington Invezz : Recent developments, such as the passage of the Carey Bill in April, are gradually solidifying the promise of a crypto-friendly regulatory environment under President Donald Trump. How do you see such policies shaping the adoption of crypto IRAs in the coming years? The Carey Bill is a major milestone, signalling that Washington is finally getting serious about integrating digital assets into the mainstream financial system. This shift should lower the perceived risk, encourage adoption, and empower everyday Americans to diversify with confidence. We expect this policy momentum to further accelerate the growth of self-directed crypto retirement accounts. By the numbers: on pace for $100 million Invezz: Can you share any numbers on BlockTrust IRA’s growth—AUM, user demographics, or average portfolio size? Are you confident of hitting $100M in assets by the end of this year as projected? Since the launch of our Managed Crypto IRA just 3 months ago, we have onboarded nearly $50 million in the managed IRAs alone, not to mention users who wish to self-manage on the BlockTrust platform due to our industry low trading fees. The average IRA transfer or 401k rollover is around $50,000. Our average client is at or approaching retirement age and, for many, this is their first venture into the Cryptocurrency space. That being said, we have clients of all ages, including international clients who use our services for non-IRA investments. Based on our current momentum, we are on track to hit our $100 million AUM target by the end of the year. Demand is strong, the onboarding process is simple, and we’re scaling quickly thanks to both client referrals and favourable market conditions. Beyond the Bitcoin ETF: the case for active management Invezz : How do you view the growing popularity of spot Bitcoin ETFs? Do they complement or compete with BlockTrust’s crypto IRA offerings? Generally speaking, we view spot Bitcoin ETFs as complementary. They help legitimize the asset class, bring in institutional flows, and raise awareness, therefore benefitting everyone in the space. However from a client’s perspective it is critical to understand the fundamental differences between ETFs and what we offer at BlockTrust. ETFs are passive, one-size-fits-all products. We offer an actively managed, tax-advantaged way to capture the upside of a digital asset boom and mitigate downside risk. Our clients want more than just exposure to Bitcoin. They want a legitimate strategy. That being said, ultimately any developments that offer increased exposure to cryptocurrencies should be beneficial to our continued growth The post Interview: Crypto now a 'strategic asset,' not a 'speculative play,' says BlockTrust CEO Jonathan Rose amidst IRA surge appeared first on Invezz",invezz,https://invezz.com/news/2025/06/10/interview-crypto-now-a-strategic-asset-not-a-speculative-play-says-blocktrust-ceo-jonathan-rose-amidst-ira-surge/,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Crypto|Crypto business|Economic|North America|Pensions|Personal Finance|Bitcoin|Ethereum|USA",cryptocompare

The shares, sold on June 9 over the Nasdaq and other open markets, fetched a weighted average price of about $0.90 per share and reduced Riot's beneficial ownership to 14.3%, the company said . The hostile takeover bid became public in May 2024, with Riot offering to buy Bitfarms for $2.30 per share, an approach that was swiftly rejected and abandoned the following month. Riot continued to buy its rival's shares to exert pressure on the board to engage with the miner. Bitfarms subsequently implemented a shareholder rights plan or ""poison pill"" to deter Riot from buying the company. Riot emphasized that it remains committed to evaluating its position in Bitfarms based on a number of evolving factors. These include potential discussions with Bitfarms’ management, the company’s strategic trajectory, and broader market conditions. Riot said it may increase or decrease its holdings in the future depending on such considerations. Bitfarms stock rose 4% in pre-market trading to $0.96.

2025-06-10T08:54:08,"Is the XRP Headed for a Bull or Bear Market? Analysis Firm Shares Its Target and Areas to Watch","Cryptocurrency analysis firm MakroVision has drawn a promising picture in its latest technical analysis for XRP. In the company's assessment, it was argued that the structure formed despite the downward trend in recent weeks indicates a strong upside potential. According to the analysis, XRP formed a classic bull flag formation during the recent decline, which was broken to the upside yesterday. At the same time, the XRP price broke above a key technical level of $2.23, indicating that the bulls are back in control. According to the analytics company, XRP quickly recovered from the lower boundary of the downtrend channel. The downtrend broken during this recovery is giving signals of renewed strength in the market. The increasing upward momentum is a technical development in favor of the bulls. Related News: HOT MOMENTS: Bitcoin Soars - Surpasses $111,000 - All-Time High Price Record About to Be Broken MakroVision shared the key levels for XRP as follows: The $2.48 level stands out as a resistance point that has faced selling pressure many times in the past. $2.65 is the breakout level from May; exceeding this threshold could pave the way for a new uptrend in XRP. The reaction at $2.23 was strong; this level should be maintained. On the downside, the $2.03–$1.95 range (both the “Golden Pocket” and the horizontal support zone) is key to maintaining the medium-term trend. *This is not investment advice.

Most altcoins are also well in the green on a daily scale, with ETH surging by 8% and HYPE nearing its all-time high. BTC Shot Up to $110.5K It was just five days ago when the primary cryptocurrency dumped hard following the escalating tension between U.S. President Donald Trump and Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk. At the time, BTC plunged to a multi-week low of $100,400. However, the bulls managed to defend that level and staged a quick recovery. Within a few days, BTC was back to its consolidation range between $104,000 and $106,000. It spent the weekend there as well, but started to climb hard on Monday and especially on Tuesday morning during the Asian trading session. The culmination occurred hours ago when the asset skyrocketed to just over $110,500, marking its highest price tag in June and a two-week peak. Although it has lost some ground since then and now sits just above $109,000, BTC is still 3.5% up on the day.

2025-06-10T08:44:46,"FinCEN compliance approval：AIXA Miner Free Cloud Mining Helps You Earn Huge Daily Profit","As technology evolves, the global mining industry is shifting to a green model powered by renewable energy. Leaders like AIXA Miner have built zero-carbon cloud mining networks using solar and wind energy, cutting unit energy consumption by 70%+ and using smart microgrids to sell surplus power for extra income. This model solves traditional mining’s high-carbon inefficiencies, creating a dual profit stream from “clean energy cost savings + grid sales dividends” and merging new energy tech with the digital economy. In crypto’s fast-paced landscape, ease of use and stable returns are key. Cloud mining removes hardware and maintenance hurdles for novices—simply purchase a contract to access top green mining, with daily earnings auto-distributed via smart contracts. The platform’s “Newbie Growth System” offers first-monthbonuses, risk hedging, and a real-time carbon footprint tracker, ensuring every investment delivers both financial and environmental value. In-depth analysis of cloud mining: principles, advantages and operation mode Cloud mining: a lightweight mining model for cryptocurrency based on remote computing power sharing Cloud mining is an innovative mechanism for cryptocurrency mining by accessing the shared computing power resources of professional data centers around the world. Users do not need to purchase mining machines (the cost of a single high-end ASIC mining machine exceeds $3000), build a cooling system (initial investment exceeds $800) or undertake power operation and maintenance (average monthly electricity bill is $500+). They only need to subscribe to standardized computing power contracts through the platform to directly call the computing power of cutting-edge equipment such as Antminer T21 and Bitmain S21. This model reduces the unit computing power cost by more than 65% through large-scale operations, and relies on the intelligent scheduling system to optimize mining efficiency in real time. Daily income is automatically distributed to user accounts through blockchain smart contracts. Compared with traditional self-built mines, cloud mining not only saves more than 90% of initial investment and 75% of operation and maintenance time, but also allows ordinary investors to easily participate in the network verification of mainstream currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum with zero technical threshold, and obtain sustainable block rewards, redefining the “passive income” paradigm in the field of digital assets. Five core advantages of cloud mining: opening a new path to easy profit 1. Convenient investment, earn money as soon as you choose No complicated operation is required, just register and choose the computing power contract to participate. The process is extremely simple and easy to understand, and novices can quickly get started, eliminating the tedious preliminary preparations for traditional investment. 2. Zero hardware investment, light equipment No need to purchase hardware equipment such as mining machines, completely get rid of the burden of procurement, maintenance and update. The platform is equipped with professional high-end mining machines, and users only need to rent computing power to enjoy efficient mining, greatly reducing the initial cost. 3. Zero technical threshold, full-process hosting No need to master blockchain or mining expertise, the platform provides full-process technical support and maintenance. From computing power allocation to mining operation, it is handled by a professional team, truly realizing an easy mode that “novices” can participate in. 4. Flexible contracts, adjustable strategies Provide multi-currency and multi-term computing power contracts, support flexible adjustment of investment strategies according to personal needs and market dynamics. Professional teams ensure stable operation of the system and ensure continuous and reliable returns. 5. High-frequency settlement, fast return on investment The settlement frequency is high, mining income can be obtained every day, and the investment return cycle is short. Compared with the traditional model, the efficiency of capital recovery and value-added is significantly improved, and the efficiency of capital use is optimized.

2025-06-10T08:44:37,"Bitcoin Hyper Presale Breaks $1M: $139K Crypto Whale Heats Up the Action for the First Ever $BTC Layer-2 with SVM","The Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) token presale hit $1M today, marking a significant milestone in this promising Layer 2 project. Particularly exciting is a series of buys totaling $139K just a few hours ago. This signals growing interest in the project, which is currently running one of the best presales of the year. With Bitcoin ($BTC) reaching an all-time high just weeks ago, signs are pointing to another surge soon. Institutions are snapping up more $BTC and the likes of ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood continue to be bullish on the world’s biggest crypto. Because of this, it’s no surprise that Bitcoin-related projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) are grabbing headlines and snagging whale buys these days. But what is it really and why would anyone spend $139K on the project? Bitcoin Hyper: Taking Bitcoin to the Next Level Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the first SVM-based Layer 2 (L2) for Bitcoin that aims to solve common issues with $BTC, such as slow transactions, high fees, and lack of native support for smart contracts or dApps. Powering it is the all-time team of Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and the decentralized Canonical Bridge , which enables the creation of fast, cheap, and composable dApps while preserving Bitcoin’s robust security. The result is a combination of lightning-fast transactions executed on the L2 and settlement on the L1 for additional security. You get high-throughput, low-cost settlements, and almost no congestion (on a blockchain known for its slow speed). By bridging $BTC to wrapped $BTC on the L2, users can participate in the Bitcoin Hyper ecosystem. And you can withdraw back to native $BTC at any time, so there are no strings attached. Solana developers will also have a much easier time scaling dApps and smart contracts on Bitcoin, something previously thought to be impossible or extraordinarily hard to achieve. The five-phase roadmap will see the mainnet launch in Q3 2025, when the L2 will be fully deployed. With an ecosystem expansion in Q4 (including a developer toolkit with API and SDK), the project is turning out to be one of the most promising altcoins this year. $HYPER Token & Presale Info $HYPER is the project’s native token. You can use it for all transaction and smart contract fees, participate in DAO decisions and community proposals, and unlock exclusive perks. Alternatively, you can stake it to earn APY rewards while helping secure the Bitcoin Hyper network. Currently priced at $0.011825, you can get $HYPER at the official Bitcoin Hyper presale page . Just connect your crypto wallet (e.g., Best Wallet ) to the presale widget, enter the number of tokens you want to buy, and pay with your credit/debit card or crypto ($ETH, $USDT, $USDC, and $BNB are accepted). You can check out our Bitcoin Hyper buying guide for more details. You can also stake your tokens for a 727% APY p/a. To date, investors have staked over 72.1M $HYPER tokens, with the number increasing by the hour. $HYPER has a total supply of 21B tokens of which the project team has allocated 30% for development. This puts the project and its token in a good position to see exponential growth, with $HYPER potentially reaching $1.50 in 2030 . This would mean a 126x in less than five years, and that’s not counting the $HYPER rewards from staking. The presale has raised $1,007,959 as of the writing of this article, and the price will increase in 11 hours. The Time is Right for Bitcoin Hyper As Bitcoin adoption should increase in the coming months and years, with more and more companies adopting it as strategic reserves, low cap coins like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) are at right place and time to capitalize on this momentum. That’s why it’s hardly surprising that it broke $1M just hours ago. Once launched, the Bitcoin Hyper L2 will bring the speed, scalability, and more affordable transaction costs that Bitcoin needs to meet growing demand. Always remember to do your own research.

2025-06-10T08:44:00,"Best crypto to buy now as BlackRock’s BTC ETF blows past $70B in record time","Bitcoin surged to its highest level so far this month on Monday, climbing above $110,000 and reversing last week’s pullback to trade just 2% below its all-time high from May. At the time of writing on Tuesday, the largest cryptocurrency rose 3.4% over the past 24 hours, extending a quiet advance into a sharp rally. Ethereum followed closely, with Ether gaining 7% to trade above $2,620. The sudden upswing caught many leveraged traders on the wrong side of the market. According to CoinGlass, over $110 million in Bitcoin short positions were liquidated within an hour. Across all crypto assets, short liquidations totaled around $330 million for the day—the highest in a month—as traders betting on price declines were forced out. The rally came even as traditional equity markets remained flat, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq showing little movement. With Bitcoin showing signs of a major rebound, overall market sentiment has turned more optimistic. In this environment, some retail investors are shifting focus to high-upside tokens like Bitcoin Pepe , which is approaching the final stages of its presale. Speculative capital continues to move into early-stage crypto ventures, as traders chase momentum-driven opportunities with the potential for substantial returns. Against this backdrop, Bitcoin Pepe has gained traction as a preferred option among investors looking to position ahead of the next wave. BlackRock’s BTC ETF continues to soar BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), has become the fastest exchange-traded fund in history to surpass $70 billion in assets under management, reaching the milestone in just 341 days. “IBIT just blew through $70b and is now the fastest ETF to ever hit that mark in only 341 days,” ETF analyst Eric Balchunas posted on X on June 9. Eric Balchunas @EricBalchunas · Follow $IBIT just blew through $70b and is now the fastest ETF to ever hit that mark in only 341 days, which is 5x faster than the old record held by GLD of 1,691 days. Nice chart from @JackiWang17 8:39 pm · 9 Jun 2025 3.1K Reply Copy link Read 120 replies He noted that the achievement came nearly five times faster than the previous record set by SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), which took 1,691 trading days to reach the same threshold. As of publication, IBIT—listed on the Nasdaq—manages $71.9 billion in assets and holds 661,457 BTC, making it the largest institutional holder of Bitcoin. It now ranks ahead of Binance (629,190 BTC) and Strategy (582,000 BTC), the firm led by prominent Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor. Bitcoin Pepe sees strong inflows Bitcoin’s sustained bullish momentum has helped lift sentiment across the broader crypto market, creating conditions that have historically preceded wider rallies. In this risk-friendly climate, investors are once again rotating into speculative plays, with meme coins among the first to benefit. Bitcoin Pepe is one project riding this wave, attracting attention for its attempt to merge internet meme culture with a serious Layer 2 blockchain proposition. Widely seen as one of 2025’s most closely tracked crypto presales, Bitcoin Pepe has differentiated itself with the ambition to “build Solana on Bitcoin”—a vision aimed at combining Bitcoin’s network security with Solana-style scalability. Unlike typical meme tokens that rely primarily on community hype, Bitcoin Pepe is anchored by a technical roadmap and infrastructure-focused narrative. The project has raised more than $14 million in presale funding ahead of a listing announcement on June 17, underscoring investor interest. As speculative capital continues to flow into early-stage assets, Bitcoin Pepe is positioning itself to capture further momentum in the final stretch of its token sale.

2025-06-10T08:34:25,"Solana Listed on Nasdaq as Solaxy, the First SOL Layer-2, Raises $46M","The NASDAQ has been bringing crypto and traditional investing together since 2025. With the June 7 filing of a standard K-8 fund , the Nasdaq noted that its standard Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index (NCIUS) would add four new cryptos – Cardano, Solana, Stellar Lumens, and XRP Ledger – to its current roster of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The move sets up the potential for the first-ever multi-asset crypto ETF, and signals crypto’s continued ascension to the upper ranks of the financial world. The news comes on the back of reports that BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF just became the fastest-ever ETF to reach $70B in total assets. Add it all together, and it’s clear that the finance world has expanded beyond recognizing just $BTC and $ETH. Solana’s $83.7B market cap could be set to swell even further on the back of a potential Nasdaq listing and possible ETF inclusion. And any growth could skyrocket when critical upgrades like Solaxy, Solana’s first-ever Layer-2, provide a much-needed boost to Solana scalability and reliability. ETFs: Kind Of A Big Deal Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are pools of assets listed on exchanges, letting ordinary investors gain exposure to the underlying assets without purchasing them directly. That makes them great for retail investors who may not want the struggle of setting up a crypto wallet – even a simple wallet like Best Wallet app . However, ETFs are also appealing to institutional investors, who use ETFs to diversify their portfolios. $BTC and $ETH ETFs both caused a spike in the price of their respective cryptos when they launched last year, and have been widely credited with fueling a steady increase in demand. Currently, $BTC ETFs account for 6% of the total Bitcoin market cap; $ETH ETFs hold 3.13%. In both cases, that’s a significant percentage of the total market cap and adds buying pressure. A potential multi-asset ETF, from Nasdaq, no less, would do the same for any included cryptos, including Solana. Solana’s Ecosystem Set to Expand Solana has historically relied on a single Rust-based validator client. That was Agave, maintained by Anza, with over 90% of stake weight running on Jito-Solana, a fork built around MEV infrastructure . The Jito-Solana consolidation boosted performance and staking returns, but raised concerns that a failure at a single point could severely disrupt the network. In a positive sign, several competing clients are emerging: Jito‑Solana: the original MEV solution, which jump-started the trend of validator innovation Firedancer: developed by Jump Crypto, aimed at blazing-fast, modular performance Sig: Syndica’s rewrite in Zig, optimized for read-heavy workloads common in dApps Paladin: a lightweight MEV-focused fork of Jito featuring a protected ‘P3’ transaction lane to mitigate sandwich attacks and enhance fairness TinyDancer: an open-source light client designed for mobile environments, with SPV verification, data sampling, and fraud proofing Taken together, these clients represent a maturing Solana ecosystem: each addresses specific limitations and contributes to greater resilience, specialization, and decentralization. They lay the groundwork for further development on a Solana network that has seen some of the best meme coins and new crypto presales launched in recent years. And now there’s another improvement on the way, just in time for any potential ETF: the first-ever Solana Layer-2 solution, Solaxy. Solaxy ($SOLX): First-Ever Solana Layer-2 for Zero Down-Time Why have investors poured $46M into the Solaxy ($SOLX) presale so far?

2025-06-10T08:32:45,"Will Bitcoin Price Hit ATH in the Next 24 Hours?","The post Will Bitcoin Price Hit ATH in the Next 24 Hours? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin is back on the move and is on the brink of making history again. At the time of publication, the BTC price is hovering around $109,418.91, up 3.62% since yesterday. Successively, its market cap has risen to $2.17 trillion, while the daily trading volume has surged by over 46%. With Bitcoin now just a few percentage points away from surpassing the current ATH, marketers are stressing out on one single question: Will Bitcoin price hit the ATH in the next 24 hours? Let us decode the quest in this Bitcoin price analysis. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis: What’s Next? Bitcoin’s current pace is boosted by consecutive breakouts above crucial resistance levels. It is worth noting that, once BTC price crossed $106,500, it quickly rallied to the $110,000 mark, a move that analyst Michael Van de Poppe rightly anticipated. According to him, the breakout above $108,900 accelerated price action further, with a peak now seen at $110,561. A brief sideways trend, as seen in the past, typically follows such parabolic moves. This could mean Bitcoin might hover near current levels or slightly correct before launching toward new highs. The RSI on the hourly chart hints at temporary exhaustion, but the structure remains bullish. The ideal zone to buy remains between $107,000 and $108,000, a support area noted for strong continuation potential. Liquidity pools below $105,500 could also serve as a bounce region if prices retrace further. If current momentum sustains and dips remain shallow, Bitcoin breaching ATH levels within the next 24 hours is not just possible, but highly probable. Curious about how Bitcoin could close the year? Read our Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! FAQs Q1: What is Bitcoin’s all-time high (ATH)? A: Bitcoin’s ATH is $111,970.17. Q2: Is now a good time to buy Bitcoin? A: Analyst insights suggest the $107,000–$108,000 range is ideal for dip-buying, making current levels attractive. Q3: Will Bitcoin hit a new ATH in 24 hours? A: Given the breakout momentum and high trading volume, a move past the ATH within 24 hours is highly likely.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/will-bitcoin-price-hit-ath-in-the-next-24-hours/,"BTC|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

Knowing how to choose a crypto exchange for beginners is essential, as crypto exchanges serve as the central platforms for buying, selling, and managing crypto assets. Whether trading Bitcoin for the first time or planning future trades, the exchange chosen will shape the overall user and trading experience. Centralized vs. Decentralized Crypto Exchanges Crypto exchanges fall into two broad categories: centralized (CEX) and decentralized exchanges (DEX) . A CEX is run by an organization that oversees user funds and facilitates transactions, much like a traditional bank. In contrast, decentralized crypto exchanges operate on smart contracts and give users complete control over their assets. While full control over assets may sound appealing, DEX platforms can be complex and challenging for beginners. They often require technical knowledge and manual processes that may overwhelm new users. For this reason, CEXs are generally better suited to those just starting out, offering more accessible interfaces and support to ease the learning curve. Security Protocols Security is a major concern when choosing a crypto exchange. A secure platform protects customer assets through advanced safety measures. Reputable crypto exchanges typically store over 90% of user funds in cold storage—offline wallets that are less vulnerable to hacking attempts. In addition to secure storage practices , users should investigate an exchange’s history with security incidents. A good track record can provide peace of mind and reduce the risk of potential breaches. Liquidity Liquidity is another vital factor. It refers to how easily and quickly assets can be bought or sold without impacting the market price. High liquidity ensures that trades are executed efficiently, even during high market volatility or when making large transactions. Platforms with strong liquidity allow new users to enter and exit positions without unnecessary delays or slippage, which is especially helpful when learning the basics of trading. Fees and Costs While the trading volume for beginner crypto traders may be small initially, understanding the fee structure of an exchange is important for long-term success. Even competitive fees on many exchanges can accumulate over time and reduce overall returns. Users should consider a range of potential charges, including: Deposit Fees: Often applied when adding fiat currency to the account. These fees vary depending on the payment method. Withdrawal Fees: Charges incurred when removing funds from the platform. Blockchain Fees: Also known as gas fees, these costs are related to transaction processing on the blockchain and are often outside the exchange’s control. Inactivity Fees: Some platforms charge monthly fees if an account remains unused for a specific period. Subscription Fees: Premium features or advanced tools for experienced traders may come with additional costs. Reviewing these charges in advance helps beginner crypto traders choose platforms that align with their trading goals. Region Availability Regulatory restrictions can limit access to certain crypto exchanges based on the user’s location. Many platforms prohibit users from countries like the United States, Russia, Venezuela, Hong Kong, and Ecuador due to legal and compliance issues. However, such restrictions can change as laws evolve. It is crucial to verify whether a platform is available in your region before creating an account and to stay updated on changing regulations through official channels. User Interface and Experience A clear and simple interface is essential for those new to crypto. Many crypto exchanges offer beginner-friendly dashboards that eliminate unnecessary jargon and prioritize ease of use. Some platforms feature tools like Bybit’s One-Click Buy option, designed to simplify the buying process. These features are valuable for users unfamiliar with complex trading platforms and terminology. Educational Materials Educational support plays a key role in helping beginner crypto traders succeed and improve their trading skills. Top crypto exchanges provide resources such as step-by-step guides, instructional videos, and blog articles tailored to new users. A thorough FAQ section and help center can resolve common issues and clarify features, making it easier for users to navigate their first transactions and gain confidence. Customer Support Strong customer support is critical, especially for new traders. Mistakes such as sending funds to the wrong wallet or account access issues can occur, and timely assistance is essential. Crypto exchanges with responsive customer service teams offer multiple support channels via email, live chat, or phone. User reviews can be a reliable indicator of a reputable exchange and availability of support offered by the platform. Which is the best crypto exchange for new traders? For new users entering crypto markets, Coinbase is considered one of the best crypto exchanges for beginners. It offers a clean interface, clear navigation, and simplified tools for buying and selling crypto, similar to Bybit’s One-Click Buy feature. Coinbase supports popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum and provides access to educational resources, helping users understand crypto markets. Its integration with payment methods such as credit cards and fiat transfers allows easy fiat-to-crypto purchases, which is critical for those just starting out. Binance ranks as the runner-up due to its wide range of features and competitive trading fees. Binance.US is often compared to Kraken and offers services like staking, cold-wallet storage, and tools for both new and experienced traders. It also has a lite mode that allows beginners and new crypto traders to trade without getting lost in advanced options/settings. However, it has faced regulatory scrutiny. Despite this, it remains one of the most popular choices for beginners due to its strong liquidity and low-cost structure. For users who prefer a more direct and straightforward approach, wallets like Phantom and MetaMask offer built-in purchasing options. Both allow users to buy cryptocurrencies directly through their respective app. Phantom supports networks such as Solana, Ethereum, and Polygon, and MetaMask allows the management of Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens. These wallets are accessible via mobile apps and browsers and are suited for those who want to manage assets and transfer crypto without using a centralized exchange. With options to pay using credit cards, debit cards, or fiat currency transfers, both wallets simplify the entry process for those who are new to crypto.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/best-crypto-exchanges-for-beginners/,"BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|TRADING","Cryptocurrency Guides",cryptocompare

It is now the fastest ETF ever to hit that mark in only trading 341 days, he said before adding that this is five times faster than the previous record held by the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD), which reached that AUM figure after 1,691 days. According to the BlackRock website , the fund’s AUM is $71.8 billion, and it held 661,457 BTC as of June 6. $IBIT just blew through $70b and is now the fastest ETF to ever hit that mark in only 341 days, which is 5x faster than the old record held by GLD of 1,691 days.

When BlackRock filed for IBIT, the price of Bitcoin was around $30,000, “and the stench of FTX was still in the air,” remarked Balchunas on June 10. He added that the asset is now trading at $110,000, which is a return of seven times that of the S&P 500, “and is now seen as legitimate for other big investors.” ETF Store President Nate Geraci also commented on the milestone, reminding people that there are eleven other spot Bitcoin ETFs and the sector overall has almost $125 billion in AUM. These are “ridiculous numbers,” he said. What a chart… IBIT hits $70bil in 341 trading days. No other ETF even close. And remember… there are 11 other spot btc ETFs.

BlackRock had a lower-than-usual day with just $121 million in inflows, beaten by Fidelity, which saw $173 million in inflows. The largest Bitcoin holder is estimated to be its pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, who holds around 1.1 million coins. However, Balchunas et al believe that BlackRock could surpass this total by mid-2026 if assets continue to flow in. Bitcoin Price Outlook The reversal of ETF flows coincided with a jump in spot markets, which saw Bitcoin reach an intraday high of $110,260 in early trading in Asia on Tuesday. The asset had dipped to $109,500 at the time of writing but remained up 3.6% on the day. Bitcoin is now just 2% away from notching another new all-time high.

2025-06-10T08:17:32,"Crypto Stocks Climb as Public Companies Accelerate Bitcoin Accumulation","U.S. crypto-linked stocks saw gains across the board on Monday, as Bitcoin prices rebounded and more public companies announced new Bitcoin purchases for their treasuries. The upward trend reflects growing investor confidence in digital assets, particularly among publicly traded firms seeking to leverage Bitcoin as a strategic financial asset. Leading the day’s movement was Nasdaq’s recent entrant, Circle Internet Group (CRCL), which jumped 7% and rose another 2.2% in after-hours trading, closing at $117.79. Major crypto miners followed suit. Core Scientific Inc. (CORZ) rose 4.27%, with a slight 0.87% bump after market close. Competitors CleanSpark Inc. (CLSK) and MARA Holdings Inc. (MARA) each climbed over 3%, with both stocks ticking up another 1% in after-hours activity. Riot Platforms Inc. (RIOT) also added 2.74% during the day, followed by a 1.2% increase after-hours. These gains coincided with Bitcoin’s own 4% surge to $110,150, edging closer to its record high of $112,000 set on May 22. Market sentiment appeared to improve amid reports of U.S.–China trade discussions held in the UK. Mixed Results for Trading Platforms’ Stocks Not all crypto-related stocks enjoyed Monday’s rally. Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD) was among the few laggards, falling nearly 2% to $73.40 after being left out of the S&P 500 index during its latest rebalancing. The omission came as a disappointment to investors who had speculated on Robinhood’s inclusion, a move that often brings a boost in share price due to increased institutional interest. In contrast, rival trading platform eToro Group Ltd. (ETOR), which recently went public , surged 10.5% and climbed another 2.4% after hours to $77.79. American crypto exchange giant Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) posted a modest 2% gain to $256.63, reflecting steady investor support amid the broader market uptrend. Bitcoin Holdings Fuel Investor Confidence Several public firms continue to embrace Bitcoin as a reserve asset. MicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR), already one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin, gained 4.71% and added over 1% in after-hours trading to reach $396.61. Meanwhile, BitMine Immersion Technologies Inc. (BMNR) became the latest firm to jump on the Bitcoin bandwagon, announcing the purchase of 100 BTC following an $18 million share offering. Despite the news, BMNR fell 8.7% before slightly rebounding by 5.2% after hours to $7.25. Energy tech company KULR Technology Group Inc. (KULR) also made headlines after announcing it had purchased another $13 million in Bitcoin, raising its total holdings to 920 BTC at an average price of $98,760 per coin. Its stocks responded positively, climbing 4.2% on the day.

2025-06-10T08:14:43,"Robert Kiyosaki Warns of ‘Civil War,’ Suggests Bitcoin, Gold, Silver Amid Financial Turmoil","Key Takeaways: Robert Kiyosaki warns of civil unrest in the U.S., calling it the start of a “fourth turning.” He blames central banks for eroding public wealth and urges investing in Bitcoin, gold, and silver. Kiyosaki predicts Bitcoin could reach $1 million within a decade as trust in fiat declines. Robert Kiyosaki, author of the influential book Rich Dad Poor Dad , has issued a stark warning about rising unrest in the United States, drawing connections between violent incidents and deeper economic turmoil. In a recent post on X , Kiyosaki declared, “Civil War has begun. ICE raids in Los Angeles erupt into mass violence… I believe we and the world are in for a long, hot violent summer.” The statement comes amid growing political division and economic instability. Kiyosaki Links U.S. Unrest to ‘Fourth Turning’ Crisis Cycle Kiyosaki tied the unrest to what historians William Strauss and Neil Howe have described as the “fourth turning,” a cyclical period of crisis that reshapes the fabric of society. Previous fourth turnings, according to the theory, include the Great Depression and World War II, the Civil War, and the American Revolution. Kiyosaki suggests that the current upheaval will be driven by public backlash against central banking practices, especially the sustained printing of money and inflationary policies. He argues that these policies erode public wealth, framing them as a form of institutional theft. “The issue is our bankers are stealing the wealth of the people via fake money, counterfeit money the central bankers print,” he wrote. He added that this era is ending, and that people should turn to alternative stores of value. As a solution, Kiyosaki is urging individuals to protect their financial futures by investing in hard assets. “Sound money, gold, silver, and Bitcoin take away the power from the corrupt bankers,” he noted. He describes gold and silver as “God’s money” and Bitcoin as “people’s money.” CIVIL WAR has begun. ICE raids in Los Angeles erupt into mass violence. BIG QUESTION: Will it spread? MY ANSWER: I believe we and the world are in for a long, hot, violent summer. This turmoil is described in the FOURTH TURNING by Strauss and Howe, who posit that society… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) June 9, 2025 Kiyosaki’s latest comments reinforce his long-standing belief that traditional financial systems are broken. Amid warnings of prolonged violence and social disruption, he advocates for individual financial sovereignty, calling on followers to “become your own bank” and stop saving “fake money.” Kiyosaki Sees $1M Bitcoin by Next Decade A longtime advocate of hard assets, Kiyosaki sees Bitcoin as a modern hedge against inflation and a tool for preserving wealth over time. In his latest prediction , Kiyosaki said he “strongly believes” the Bitcoin price will reach $180,000 to $200,000 by the end of this year. Over the next decade, he sees BTC at $1 million, gold at $30,000 per ounce, and silver at $3,000. Notably, Kiyosaki is not the only one expressing confidence in Bitcoin’s future. As reported, Shunyet Jan, Head of Derivatives at Bybit, has projected that Bitcoin could reach $125,000 by the end of Q2 if current trends persist. Likewise, crypto analyst Scott Melker has said he believes Bitcoin could surge to $250,000 by the end of 2025 , driven by institutional demand and a maturing market structure.

2025-06-10T08:12:23,"Cardano launches its first Bitcoin DeFi protocol ‘Cardinal’","Cardano has launched Cardinal, its first decentralized finance protocol designed specifically for Bitcoin users. The announcement was made by Cardano ( ADA ) founder Charles Hoskinson on June 9 via X. Developed by Input Output, the research and development team behind Cardano, Cardinal allows Bitcoin ( BTC ) holders to access DeFi services such as lending, staking, and borrowing without using traditional custodians or centralized bridges. Welcome to the first Bitcoin DeFi protocol developed for Cardano https://t.co/CoYvrYnIfI — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) June 9, 2025 Cardinal functions by wrapping Bitcoin, particularly its unspent transaction outputs. UTXOs are bits of Bitcoin that have been left over from transactions and are used to represent ownership. They are converted into wrapped tokens by the protocol, which maintains a 1:1 peg with Bitcoin. Users can redeem their wrapped BTC at any time through a secure, fraud-resistant process. What makes Cardinal different from typical wrapped Bitcoin solutions is its trust-minimized structure. Instead of depending on a central custodian or federated system, Cardinal uses MuSig2, a cryptographic system that allows multiple parties to sign transactions together. This ensures that the original Bitcoin stays locked on its native chain and that the system functions securely, even if only one participant is honest. You might also like: Brave Wallet expands support with Cardano integration Another key feature is Cardinal’s approach to rehypothecation. In traditional finance and some crypto systems, rehypothecation allows custodians to reuse user assets, often without full transparency. Cardinal avoids this by allowing users complete control over their assets while preserving the original Bitcoin. In addition, the protocol makes use of BitVMX, an off-chain execution system that maintains decentralization while enabling complex Bitcoin operations. This configuration facilitates safe, easy asset transfers between the two networks when paired with Cardano smart contracts and Bitcoin’s built-in scripting capabilities. The project was showcased during a live demo at the Bitcoin 2025 conference, where IO performed a bridgeless BTC-to-Cardano transfer using BitVMX. The event marked a major step in Cardano’s efforts to become a platform for Bitcoin-native applications. Despite recent progress, Cardano’s DeFi total value locked has declined, from peak of $415 million in May to around $334 million by June 10, as per DefiLlama data . The team hopes Cardinal will help bring in new liquidity by offering Bitcoin holders more ways to use their assets within a DeFi environment, without leaving the Bitcoin ecosystem.

2025-06-10T08:12:11,"BlackRock Says Institutions Bitcoin Adoption is Still Very Early","Asset manager BlackRock has highlighted a growing interest among institutions and wealth advisors in Bitcoin but insisted it is still in its early stages. Robert Mitchnick, the head of digital assets at the $11.5 trillion asset management firm, said in the Bloomberg ETF IQ interview that wealth advisors are now turning towards Bitcoin. And while this is a positive development, he emphasized that it is still in the early stages, and more institutions will come around soon.His comments came as the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) nears an impressive $72 billion in net assets. The Bitcoin investment fund experienced pent-up demand between April and May. In May alone, the product attracted a net inflow of $5.91 billion, marking its strongest month since March 2024. BlackRock Bitcoin ETF May 2025 Netflow Sosovalue BlackRock Bitcoin ETF May 2025 Netflow | Sosovalue Wealth Advisors Are ComingRecent 13-F filings with the US SEC for Q1 2025 saw growing exposure from wealth advisors towards Bitcoin spot ETFs. For instance, Goldman Sachs increased its exposure, while new names, such as the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala , also bought more Bitcoin.BlackRock’s Mitchnick acknowledged the growing adoption of the Bitcoin ETF wrapper for new and experienced institutions. However, he stressed that it is very early in terms of wealth advisor adoption.The approval process for new ETFs takes time, as institutions conduct thorough due diligence on the nature and viability of the fund. Nonetheless, he identified a strong interest among some of the “largest firms,” so much so that some of them are lowering their barriers and approving that their advisors buy Bitcoin .Possible Drivers for Bitcoin ETFs SurgeNonetheless, the IBIT has been one of the most successful launches in the history of ETFs. The Bitcoin investment product became the fastest to reach a net asset under management of $50 billion and is now well above $71 billion.When asked the possible drivers for this stunning growth, Mitchnick highlighted a congregation of several bullish catalysts. He stated that pent-up demand for the vehicles, which tracks Bitcoin’s performance, initially started with retail investors.Soon enough, high-net-worth individuals began gaining exposure. Recall that several billionaires, including Ricardo Salinas Pliego , have staggering amounts of their portfolio in Bitcoin and Bitcoin-related products. Meanwhile, it remains unclear if the Mexican billionaire holds IBIT shares.Now, Mitchnick has revealed steady progress in institutional adoption. According to him, the massive demand has fueled these incessant inflows into the funds.Bitcoin is Volatile Yet AppealingMeanwhile, Mitchnick acknowledged a reduction in Bitcoin’s volatility. While stating that Bitcoin, on a standalone basis, is a volatile asset, citing its relatively novel technology, he noted that the asset offers a unique appeal to investors. “It is still volatile, but at the same time, its risk and return drivers are markedly different from most of the rest of the assets in a traditional portfolio, and that’s important,” Mitchnick emphasized.For the uninitiated, Bitcoin is one of the best-performing assets of the last decade, demonstrating a level of consistency in rewarding its adopters. The pioneering cryptocurrency rallied 121% last year and is up 15% year-to-date.At the time of writing, it trades at $109,608, representing a 3.78% increase in the past 24 hours.Notably, Mitchnick also discussed BlackRock's Ethereum spot ETF, which he disclosed is currently strongly driven by retail investor attraction. He noted that, although there is an exciting story surrounding Ethereum, as seen with Bitcoin, it focuses more on technological innovation and blockchain adoption.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/10/blackrock-says-institutions-bitcoin-adoption-is-still-very-early/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=blackrock-says-institutions-bitcoin-adoption-is-still-very-early,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET","Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today|Latest BlackRock News Updates Today",cryptocompare
2025-06-10T08:09:40,"FOMC Meeting June 18: Crypto Market Prepares for No FED Rate Cut Decision","The post FOMC Meeting June 18: Crypto Market Prepares for No FED Rate Cut Decision appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin is hovering above $108,000, gaining over 2% in the past 24 hours. The crypto market overall is holding a solid $3.38 trillion valuation. But as investors gear up for the next big Federal Reserve meeting on June 18, many are starting to temper their expectations, especially when it comes to interest rate cuts. No FED Rate Cuts—At Least Not Yet For months, traders expected the Fed to begin cutting rates by summer. But recent job data changed the mood. Hiring remains strong, and inflation is still running above the Fed’s comfort level. That gives the central bank little reason to ease up on its current policy. The CME FedWatch Tool now shows a 99.9% chance the Fed will keep rates steady in June, with just a 0.1% chance of a 25 basis point cut. Looking to July, the odds of a rate cut sit at just 14.5%. Back in May, those chances were much higher, showing how much sentiment has shifted in just a few weeks. Trump, ECB Push for Cuts—but Fed Holds Its Ground The pressure is building on the Fed. The European Central Bank just cut its interest rates by 25 basis points. And Donald Trump is calling for a much more aggressive 100 bps rate cut in the U.S., saying it would be “rocket fuel” for the economy. He’s also criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell and hinted that Kevin Warsh could replace him. Still, the Fed remains cautious. Officials are watching how tariffs and inflation will affect the economy before making any big moves. So for now, it looks like interest rates will stay between 425–450 basis points for the foreseeable future. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : U.S. CPI Report to Decide Crypto’s Next Move – Will the Fed Hold Back? , How Crypto Is Reacting Crypto markets are in a bit of a mixed mood. Bitcoin and Gold are showing strength, and some traders are shifting out of the U.S. dollar into riskier assets like crypto. According to Sergei Gorev from Youhodler , this trend is helping keep Bitcoin’s price elevated. But not all signs are bullish. Gorev also points out that Bitcoin’s chart is showing a potential “ Head and Shoulders” pattern , which, if it plays out, could pull prices down to around $92,000. With the FOMC meeting coming up and inflation data on the way, the crypto market is walking a fine line between optimism and caution. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) sets U.S. monetary policy, including interest rates. The next meeting is June 17-18, 2025, where markets widely expect rates to remain steady given current economic data. How does the FOMC’s interest rate decision affect the crypto market? If the Fed holds rates steady (or raises them), it can dampen risk appetite for assets like crypto, leading to range-bound prices or slight dips. Lower rates generally boost crypto by making borrowing cheaper and increasing market liquidity. What are the short-term and long-term crypto market reactions to FOMC decisions? Short-term, crypto can see volatility based on the Fed’s “hawkish” (cautious) or “dovish” (easing) tone. Long-term, a “higher for longer” rate scenario might limit investment, but any easing signals could be a catalyst for price increases.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/fomc-meeting-june-18-crypto-market-prepares-for-no-fed-rate-cut-decision/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare

2025-06-10T08:00:23,"Bitcoin Defies Bears: Price Nears $108,000 Despite $250M Exchange Inflows","On-chain data shows the exchanges recently received a large amount of Bitcoin inflows, but so far, the asset’s price has only been going up. Bitcoin Has Seen A Spike In Exchange Inflows Recently In a new post on X, the institutional DeFi solutions provider Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) has talked about the latest trend in the Exchange Netflow for Bitcoin. The Exchange Netflow is an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the net amount of the asset that’s moving into or out of the wallets associated with all centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric is positive, it means the exchange inflows outweigh the exchange outflows. As one of the main reasons why investors would deposit their coins to these platforms is for selling-related purposes, this kind of trend can have a bearish impact on the asset’s price. Related Reading: Bitcoin & Ethereum Diverge—ETF Flows Just Flipped The Narrative On the other hand, the indicator being under the zero mark suggests the holders are taking out a net number of tokens from exchanges. Such a trend can be a sign that the investors are accumulating, which can naturally prove to be bullish for the cryptocurrency. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Exchange Netflow since the start of the month: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Exchange Netflow has recently mostly been contained in the negative territory, but the latest value (yesterday’s) has been positive. In total, the investors have deposited a net $262.75 million of the asset to the exchange-connected wallets with this inflow spike. According to the analytics firm, this marks the first day of significant deposits since May 27th. As mentioned before, exchange inflows are something that can turn out to be bearish for the coin’s value. So far, however, the opposite has happened for Bitcoin, as its price has soared instead. This could indicate that even if there are some large holders looking to sell with these deposits, enough demand has surfaced at the same time that BTC has not only been able to ride out this wave of potential selling pressure, but actually add to its recovery. Related Reading: Crypto Suffers $1 Billion Flush As Musk-Trump Feud Shakes Bitcoin According to the analytics firm Glassnode, short liquidations have registered a notable uptick alongside this surge in the cryptocurrency. “Over just 4 hours, total short liquidations spiked from $105K to $359K (24H SMA),” notes Glassnode. Generally, large liquidations end up providing fuel to the price move that caused them, so in this case, it’s possible the short squeeze may have provided support to the Bitcoin rally. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $107,900, up over 3% in the last seven days.

2025-06-10T08:00:00,"BTC News: Bitcoin Solaris Raises $3.8M in Presale, Early Investors Set for 233% Returns at Launch","In a cycle filled with speculation and recycled promises, Bitcoin Solaris has raised $3.8 million not through hype, but through a model that shows its math. Phase 6 is now live at $6 per token, and the next major step is a centralized exchange listing projected at $20 — a 233% increase for current participants. What stands out isn’t the jump alone. It’s the framework supporting it. Bitcoin Solaris isn’t launching on paper. It’s backed by active audits, functioning mechanics, and a sharply defined 21 million token cap. That’s what’s drawing capital — not influencers, not empty ads, but protocol-level logic. What Powers This Demand? Every strong presale has a reason it doesn’t need to push marketing gimmicks. For Bitcoin Solaris, that reason is structural. The token isn’t diluted by staking inflation or burdened with team-controlled emissions. Only 4.2 million BTC-S have been designated for presale across all phases: there is no secret allocation, and no dev wallet minting event waiting down the line. The blockchain itself operates on a hybrid architecture: a base consensus layer combining Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Capacity, paired with a high-throughput Solaris Layer running Proof-of-History and Proof-of-Time. Together, this system clears over 10,000 transactions per second with a finality time of two seconds — all while consuming 99.95% less energy than traditional mining. Audited. Verified. Positioned. Both Cyberscope and Freshcoins have completed independent audits of the protocol and mobile infrastructure. Smart contracts, consensus logic, and application data have been tested for both security and performance compliance. Cyberscope Audit PDF Freshcoins Audit PDF KYC Verification This level of pre-launch transparency isn’t typical — and it’s exactly why capital is flowing. The protocol doesn’t rely on trust. It shows its work. Analyst Attention Is Already Here Ben Crypto , a known figure in crypto forecasting, recently spotlighted Bitcoin Solaris in a full analysis, citing its scarcity mechanics and audit-backed infrastructure as reasons the token could easily cross $100 within 24 months. That analysis is based on a functioning ecosystem with working code, a defined user base, and a presale designed to reward early participants — not trap them in vesting cliffs or delayed unlocks. $6 Entry Is Still Open Bitcoin Solaris is still in Phase 6 of its presale. BTC-S tokens are available at $6 for a limited window before the project moves to centralized listing and public exposure. With benchmarks set for $20 upon launch, the entry spread is what’s driving urgency. Investors aren’t waiting on marketing events or big promises. They’re entering a network where functionality is live, and the multiplier is locked in by math — not guesswork.

2025-06-10T07:33:37,"UK plans to recover cryptocurrencies tied to bankruptcy cases","The Insolvency Service (IS) appointed former police investigator Andrew Small as its first dedicated crypto intelligence specialist to help recover digital assets for the UK economy from bankruptcy and criminal cases. Small will help track crypto assets lost in criminal cases and provide the agency with detailed knowledge of the crypto market. The IS claimed that the number of insolvency cases involving crypto as a recoverable asset rose by 420% in the past five years, with 59 cases in 2024/25 compared to 14 in 2019/20. The estimated value of crypto assets identified in insolvency cases also skyrocketed 364x to more than £520K (~$710K) in 2024/25, from just a little over £1K in 2019/20. A 2024 study by the Financial Conduct Authority claimed that crypto assets had risen in popularity in recent years. It found that seven million adults in the UK, almost 12% of the population, held some form of crypto, up from 3.2 million adults (4.4%) in 2021. Special agent Small said there was a rapid rise in crypto ownership in the UK and a similar rise in crypto assets lost in bankruptcy and criminal cases. His work will focus on helping the Insolvency Service trace, assess, and recover crypto holdings from individuals and companies subject to insolvency proceedings.

He will be responsible for tracing and identifying digital assets in bankruptcy and criminal cases. The role, based within the agency’s… — CryptOpus (@ImCryptOpus) June 9, 2025 Crypto specialist Small explained that the Insolvency Service had a duty to trace and recover money and assets from individuals or companies in insolvency cases and work to return as much money owed to creditors as possible. The Official Receiver Service, a key part of the Insolvency Service, identified £523,580 of crypto assets across 59 insolvency cases in 2024/25, compared to just £1,436 of crypto across 14 cases in 2019/20. Andrew’s new crypto asset intelligence role will be based within the Insolvency Service’s Investigation and Enforcement Services team, meaning he will primarily focus on crypto asset ownership in criminal cases. Neil Freebury, head of intelligence at the Insolvency Service, said Andrew brought a wealth of knowledge to this role and his previous experience as an economic crime investigator within the police. Freebury added that Andrew’s appointment would help IS investigators dealing with cases where crypto was a factor. “Crypto is very much a recoverable asset, and my role will help the agency by providing specialist knowledge about the types of crypto assets available and the associated technology used to buy, sell, and store them.” – Andrew Small , Crypto Intelligence Specialist at the Insolvency Services The IS was keen on Bitcoin, Ethereum , DOGE, Litecoin, and Non-fungible tokens (NFTs). However, Freebury pointed out that the number of insolvency cases involving crypto asset ownership rose four-fold in the past five years as crypto grew in popularity. UK to collect specific crypto user and transaction data starting next year The UK government will require crypto companies operating in the country to collect user and transaction information from 1 January 2026. The HM Revenue & Customs announced last week that the UK government’s data collection plan will follow the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) Crypto Asset Reporting Framework (CARF). The HMRC also said crypto firms may start collecting information earlier to be ready when the new rules come into force. For individual users, the required data will include the user’s name, date of birth, home address, country of residence, National Insurance number or Unique Taxpayer Reference (for UK residents), and the tax identification number (TIN) along with the country where it was issued (for non-UK residents). For entity users, companies must collect the legal business name, main business address, registration number (for UK firms), and the TIN and issuing country (for non-UK firms). In some cases, platforms must also gather details of the company’s controlling persons. Firms must also report sender and recipient names, addresses, tax IDs & full trade details (token type, quantity, GBP value, & timestamp). Failure to provide accurate, complete, or verified reports could result in penalties of up to £300 per user.

According to data from crypto.news, Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ) shot up 22% to an intraday high of $1.26 on June 10, morning Asian time, pushing its market cap past $1.23 billion, enough to flip Dogwifhat ( WIF ) in rankings. Open interest in Fartcoin’s futures market also reached an all-time high of $713 million today, indicating that traders are heavily speculating on further price movements. The long/short ratio on major exchanges is also above 1, signaling more traders are betting long than short, a bullish sign overall. Much of today’s gains followed after Coinbase confirmed plans to list Fartcoin perpetual futures on both its Advanced and International Exchange platforms, starting June 12 at 9:30 AM UTC. Although it’s just the futures for now, traders believe a spot listing could follow, especially since Coinbase had previously added Fartcoin to its assets roadmap on June 6.

Fartcoin price analysis On the technical side, FARTCOIN has broken out from the upper edge of a broadening wedge pattern on the 4-hour USDT chart, a setup that’s often seen as a bullish reversal signal. FARTCOIN 20-day and 50-day SMA chart — June 10 | Source: crypto.news After the breakout, it seems to have found strong support in the $0.86–$0.93 zone. The 20-day simple moving average has crossed above the 50-day, forming what analysts call a golden cross, which usually suggests a continuation of upward momentum. Meanwhile, both the RSI and Stochastic Oscillator are pointing up, hinting that buying pressure is building. FARTCOIN MACD and RSI chart — June 10 | Source: crypto.news Technical analyst Waleed Ahmed also pointed out that FARTCOIN has broken out of a bullish Shark Harmonic pattern, which often signals a strong move to the upside. Given this setup, the next key target appears to be around $1.38, which lines up with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level. If FARTCOIN breaks above that, bulls may aim for the $2 mark, roughly a 60% gain from current levels. That said, there’s still some risk on the way. According to Nansen data, while the top 100 holders have been adding to their FARTCOIN bags, many smart money wallets and whales have been selling over the last 30 days. Exchange balances are also up 18%, raising concerns about a possible sell-off in the near term. Source: Nansen If FARTCOIN fails to stay above the important $1 psychological support, sellers could try to drag it down to $0.50, which would mean a 60% drop from where it’s currently trading.

2025-06-10T07:19:00,"Crypto’s Next Big Success Might Just Be Neo Pepe ($NEOP)","This Year’s Best Token Presale Hands-Down Crypto investors and analysts have been focusing their attention on the new project Neo Pepe ($NEOP), identifying it as one of the best-performing tokens among the crypto projects launched in 2025. This crypto project is not just built on hype or inspired by the meme industry, Neo Pepe was built to be decentralized and a token going against the traditional financial systems and their market controls. As financial markets become more regulated, Neo Pepe offers a better option that is designed for transparency, community governance, and decentralization. As the market continues to anticipate new projects, Neo Pepe is positioned as another entry into the market but with more transformative potential that investors can relate to due to its focus on freedom and financial independence. Experts Can’t Be -More- Excited For This Presale Crypto experts are anticipating the strong narrative backing Neo Pepe’s economic mechanism. Investors see the project as an opportunity, with its token possessing the ability to resist centralized financial controls with profit-oriented features. Its scheduled token unlock ensures that the market circulation is balanced, reducing the risks associated with the launch of new tokens. In addition, its auto-liquidity mechanism assures investors that the value of the token can be sustained, making it the best choice of presale in 2025 for investors. Another attractive feature is the ability of the project to carry its community along in decisions through voting and governance. This allows quick adaptation that is in line with the project’s laid down guidelines in terms of its investors and community choices, a big difference from traditional digital assets. Encouraging Tokenomics at Foundation Neo Pepe’s tokenomics sets it apart in the crypto industry. The tokenomics was set up to accommodate its presale, which will take place in 16 phases, moving the price of the token from $0.05 to $0.16. The project is also aiming for fundraising to hit its target of $50 million. This approach was designed to ensure that the growth of the token is structured, helping it sustain its growth. Allocation Percentage (%) Purpose Presale 45% Community-driven token launch Marketing 25% Promotion, Partnerships, Outreach Development 10% Project Growth, Upgrades, Security Liquidity 10% Exchange Liquidity & Initiatives Ecosystem 5% Community Incentives & Initiatives Giveaways 5% Rewards, Events, Engagement After its launch, $NEOP will unlock hourly, ensuring immediate circulation and avoiding price volatility, a feature that is expected to attract investors. In addition, every transaction is expected to add 2.5% to the liquidity, ensuring that a portion of its LP tokens are burnt to stabilize the price of the token and boost investor assurance. In addition, the token distribution shows that the project is following its purpose, allocating 45% of its supply to the presale, 25% to marketing, 10% to its platform development, another 10% to liquidity, and 5% each to ecosystem development and giveaways. This allocation move will ensure growth and support for its community and the development of its platform. Competitor Coins Run for Cover Allows token holders to make decisions through its governance framework, especially on listings and developments. Sets itself apart from tokens like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) by putting its community first and pushing decentralized governance. Stands out among presales like Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) and Solaxy (SOLX), which lacks tools to carry its community along. Positioned as an asset with high potential due to its development model and direction. Avoids centralization risks faced by platforms like Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) by allowing community contribution. Seamless Token Acquisition Steps Entering the project at this early stage requires a straightforward process: You need to set up a wallet compatible with ERC-20 tokens like MetaMask. You will need to deposit funds in USDT, USDC, or ETH. Connect your wallet using the Neo Pepe presale platform. Swap your choice of crypto for $NEOP Check your transaction details and confirm the transaction details. Safely store your tokens inside your wallet. Potential No Other Coin Can Replicate Neo Pepe is not just looking to be a participant in the crypto space, it wants to lead it. Using its tokenomics and community governance, Neo Pepe ensures its members are updated with the happenings, making it a market leader in the crypto market. Compared to traditional cryptocurrencies, the project’s presale structure and liquidity features position it at the front of the growing crypto market. Neo Pepe’s approach to unlocking its token and liquidity maintenance is different from the volatility experienced by some presales, providing investors with a stable investment, making it one of the best presales in the current market. Investors looking for the next big opportunity in the crypto market need to start looking into Neo Pepe ($NEOP), not because of its present appeal but for its promise of combining decentralization and investor empowerment. Crypto investors looking for early crypto projects to invest in are looking at Neo Pepe, with most of them confident in its role as a big player in the market in the coming years. With its presale stages defined and its governance model in place, Neo Pepe presents a blend of opportunity, community, and development for investors looking for them, presenting itself as the next digital asset to look forward to in the market.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/cryptos-next-big-success-might-just-be-neo-pepe-neop/,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Press Release",cryptocompare

The warning came after a strange post appeared on his profile, claiming the country had made Bitcoin legal tender and was creating a $5 million Bitcoin reserve fund. The message, written in English, had a Spanish-language image attached that falsely appeared to be an official government notice. The government told the public to ignore anything coming from the account until further notice. Officials said they noticed “irregular activity” that showed signs of “unauthorized entry.” That same morning, the cybersecurity team in Paraguay began working with X’s security department to figure out who got in and how. Officials connect hack to wider crypto scam wave in Latin America According to Reuters , the timing of the breach tracks with a growing wave of crypto scams on social media. These types of frauds usually show up in the form of sponsored posts or fake official messages pushing people to invest. The hacker behind Peña’s account followed that same playbook. The story echoes what happened in Argentina earlier this year, when President Javier Milei promoted a token named Libra on his social media that collapsed almost immediately. That scandal blew up in his face and triggered public backlash, especially after critics accused him of helping to pump a worthless coin. El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele actually did make Bitcoin legal in his country back in 2021 and launched tokenized bonds shortly after. But what happened in Paraguay this week wasn’t real policy—it was a digital trap planted by someone exploiting Peña’s account. This isn’t Paraguay’s first brush with hackers. In May, the communications ministry tracked at least 18 attacks on over a dozen public agencies, including the civil aviation regulator and justice ministry. Those hacks targeted email systems, cloud platforms, and login credentials, and no official link to Peña’s breach has been confirmed. As of now, Peña hasn’t made any public statements, and the fake post has been deleted. No arrests or leads have been announced. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-06-10T07:15:37,"Veteran Analyst Brandt Says Ethereum Big Day Is Here","Veteran analyst Peter Brandt suggests that Ethereum may be on the verge of a breakout, saying, ""Every dog has its day."" Ethereum’s price has increased recently, particularly between June 9 and June 10, surging from around $2,400 to over $2,700. This uptick marks a significant rally for the cryptocurrency, continuing its bullish momentum after a brief dip.While Ethereum has experienced considerable volatility in recent months, Peter Brandt, a veteran technical analyst, believes the asset is now setting the stage for a potential breakout.A Potential Breakout in the MakingBrandt highlighted a potential turning point for Ethereum in a post on X. The accompanying chart highlighted how ETH has transitioned from a descending channel to a symmetrical triangle formation. According to Brandt’s analysis, Ethereum has been moving within a descending channel since December 2024, when its price peaked above $4,000. Throughout this period, price movements remained capped within the channel’s boundaries, with resistance at the upper end and support at the lower end. Notably, Ethereum's price tested key levels, including $3,700 in January and $1,390 in April.However, after breaking out of this channel in mid-April, Ethereum's price began to form the symmetrical triangle pattern, which typically signals consolidation before a breakout. In this pattern, Ethereum's price has been capped on both ends. On the downside, support has been tested multiple times, most recently on June 6 at $2,392. Meanwhile, resistance near the $2,700 mark has held firm several times since May.Moving Averages and Market SentimentEthereum’s 18-period moving average is trending upwards, signaling potential short-term bullish momentum. The moving average is currently acting as dynamic support, which may indicate an ongoing upward trend in the market. This aligns with the recent rally and provides further evidence that Ethereum may be gaining strength.On the other hand, the ADX (Average Directional Index) currently sits at 22.72, suggesting that the current trend remains weak. The ADX reading below 25 typically indicates a market consolidating rather than in a strong directional move. If Ethereum's price falls below the $2,150 support level, it could signal a bearish breakdown, potentially leading to further declines toward the long-term support below the $1,390 mark. However, Peter Brandt suggests that Ethereum may be on the verge of a breakout, remarking, ""Every dog has its day — woof woof ETH.” This suggests now could be Ethereum’s time to shine after vastly underperforming Bitcoin.On the upside, resistance is positioned just below the $4,000 mark. Should Ethereum continue its rally, it could surge by approximately 48.7%, moving from its current price of $2,689 to the $4,000 resistance level.Inflows Into Ethereum: A Strong Market SignalMeanwhile, the digital asset market has seen strong inflows, with Ethereum leading the pack. According to CoinShares data , digital asset investment products experienced $224 million in inflows last week, continuing a seven-week streak of positive growth. Notably, Ethereum accounted for the largest share of these inflows, with $296.4 million entering the market. This marks the seventh consecutive week of inflows for Ethereum, pushing the total to $1.5 billion over this period.In contrast, Bitcoin has seen outflows, with $56.5 million leaving the market. This shift in investor sentiment suggests that Ethereum is attracting more attention, further supporting the belief that the cryptocurrency could be positioning itself for a breakout.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/10/veteran-analyst-brandt-says-ethereum-big-day-is-here/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=veteran-analyst-brandt-says-ethereum-big-day-is-here,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Market|Ethereum Price Prediction|Latest Ethereum (ETH) News Today",cryptocompare

2025-06-10T07:04:47,"$947,000 Allegedly Stolen From Wells Fargo ATM Machines As Employee Scrambles To Cover Trading Losses: Report","A former Wells Fargo employee in California is reportedly facing charges over allegations he stole $947,000 from the bank’s ATM machines during a span of nearly two years. In a new report in the San Francisco Chronicle, Tamim Ghulam Haidar, the former Wells Fargo Union City branch operations associate manager, is accused of putting less money into the bank’s ATMs than he reported and pocketing the difference for his own use. Haidar allegedly deposited the ill-gotten gains he is accused of “knowingly and intentionally” embezzling into his own bank accounts or those he controlled and used the funds to cover losses that “he incurred while trading in the foreign currency markets,” according to legal documents filed in the U.S. District Court Northern District of California. Haidar allegedly committed the crimes from February 2021 to October 2022. Prosecutors accuse Haidar of sometimes using other bank employees’ credentials to deposit cash in the ATM to “conceal the fact he was inputting false and inflated dollar amounts.” Haidar is charged with embezzlement by a bank employee and engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity. He faces up to 30 years in federal prison. Prosecutors are also seeking to force Haidar to forfeit the money he allegedly stole.
