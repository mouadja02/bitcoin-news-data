2025-06-10T01:00:49,"Bitcoin Set For Dramatic Repricing As Wall Street Piles In: Cathie Wood","Appearing on the Diary of a CEO podcast, ARK Invest founder Cathie Wood said that the “green-light” approval of spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January 2024 has only just opened the gates to what she called an “institutional land-rush” for the asset. “Institutions have barely started committing,” she told host Steven Bartlett, adding that they control “trillions of dollars” yet have access to barely “a hundred-billion-dollar sliver” of new supply because just one million bitcoin remain to be mined. Why Cathie Wood Eyes $1.5 Million Per Bitcoin Wood framed the supply-demand mismatch in stark macroeconomic terms. With roughly 20 million BTC already in existence, US spot ETFs alone have vacuumed up more than 1.2 million coins—about 5.7 percent of the eventual supply—since launching eighteen months ago, according to Bitbo’s on-chain ETF tracker. Daily flow data show that even on a quiet trading day, funds such as BlackRock ’s IBIT and Ark-21Shares’ ARKB can collectively absorb tens of millions of dollars’ worth of bitcoin, occasionally draining hundreds of coins from open markets in a single session. “The SEC’s decision effectively legitimised bitcoin as an asset class,” Wood said, arguing that fiduciary pressure will force large wealth managers to follow early adopters. She compared the current migration to the early 1990s adoption of index funds: once one blue-chip pension moved, “others had to consider it” or risk underperforming. Pointing to her own firm’s experience—ARK first purchased GBTC at roughly $250 per coin in 2015—Wood said that scepticism from traditional finance often marks “the sweet spot” for long-horizon investors. Wood’s long-term thesis is explicitly monetary. Quoting her mentor Arthur Laffer, she called bitcoin “the rules-based global monetary system we’ve waited for since the US closed the gold window in 1971 .” Because bitcoin’s algorithmic issuance schedule is immune to fiscal or political tampering, she contends, it will attract central-bank reserves and corporate treasuries in jurisdictions where local currencies are chronically devalued by policy error. That dynamic, she argues, is accelerating: “Emerging-market savers need an insurance policy,” and for younger cohorts “digital gold” is already more intuitive than bullion. ARK’s revised base-case model now targets $1.5 million per bitcoin by 2030—more than a fifteen-fold gain from today’s price. The three biggest “building blocks,” Wood said, are institutional portfolio allocation, millennial and Gen-Z store-of-value demand, and grassroots adoption in inflation-prone economies via stablecoin rails. None of the current projections, she noted, assume a wholesale shift of sovereign reserves, nor do they model secondary demand from bitcoin-secured lending, both of which she believes could escalate if deficits and debt service costs keep climbing. Wood also linked bitcoin’s appeal to a broader macro backdrop of fiscal stress and waning confidence in fiat regimes. “Government spending is taxation—either now or through inflation,” she said, warning that persistent deficits threaten the dollar’s reserve-currency status and therefore heighten the allure of an apolitical ledger secured by “the largest computer network in the world.” While she acknowledged bitcoin’s volatility, Wood argued that maturation of derivatives markets and increased ETF depth are already dampening extreme price swings. With spot bitcoin ETFs now controlling a stockpile larger than the holdings of Satoshi-era wallets , Wood contends the supply shock has only begun. “There is no mechanism to create more than 21 million coins,” she told Bartlett. “If institutions want exposure, the price will have to adjust—dramatically.” Exactly how dramatic remains the $1.5 million question, but Wood’s warning is unambiguous: the slowest movers may discover they are trying to buy what the market can no longer readily supply.

2025-06-10T01:00:35,"Bitcoin & Ethereum Diverge—ETF Flows Just Flipped The Narrative","Data shows the demand for spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has cooled off for Bitcoin, while Ethereum has continued to attract inflows. Bitcoin Has Ended A Streak Of Positive ETF Flows In a new thread on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the total balance of the US spot ETFs has changed for Bitcoin and Ethereum recently. The spot ETFs refer to investment vehicles that provide an alternate means of gaining exposure to a cryptocurrency’s price movements in a manner that’s familiar to traditional investors. Related Reading: Crypto Suffers $1 Billion Flush As Musk-Trump Feud Shakes Bitcoin These ETFs are a relatively new presence in the sector, but they have gained sufficient popularity to become a key part of the market. Investors who previously avoided digital assets due to the perceived complexity of wallets and exchanges can now invest through ETFs, which trade on traditional exchanges. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the spot ETFs for Bitcoin back in January 2024. They got approval for Ethereum half a year later, in July 2024. First, here is how the balance held by the spot ETFs has changed for Ethereum since their inauguration: As displayed in the above graph, the total balance of the Ethereum spot ETFs has been on the rise recently. In fact, the cryptocurrency has now seen four straight weeks of net inflows. In all, 97,800 ETH have entered into the wallets associated with these ETFs during this green netflow streak. Though despite the continuous inflows, their total holdings are yet to hit the 3.81 million ETH peak from February, as they currently sit at 3.77 million ETH, about 41,000 tokens lower. “Accumulation is steady, but room remains for further upside,” notes Glassnode. Bitcoin has also seen growth in its spot ETF holdings recently, but unlike Ethereum, the number one digital asset saw the metric surpass its high from February last month. That said, while the Bitcoin spot ETFs were enjoying inflows until very recently, the trend has changed during the past week as net outflows have occurred instead. This has been the first negative week in eight for the BTC ETFs. “Total holdings are now 1.20M BTC, down ~11.5K BTC from the late-May peak,” explains the analytics firm. “A pause in demand after a strong run-up – watch for signs of re-acceleration.” Related Reading: Bitcoin RSI Dips Below 30—Is A New All-Time High Next?

The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $323 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of around $19 billion, rebounded from the lower border of a consolidation level of around $2,480. As a result, the ETH price has been retesting a crucial local resistance level around $2,681, whereby the Ether price was rejected four times in the past four weeks. Major Reasons Ethereum Price Will Rally Higher This Week Strong Institutional Adoption and ETF Flows According to market data analysis from CoinShares, Ethereum’s investment product dominated last week’s cash inflow with about $296 million. Notably, Ether’s investment product outpaced Bitcoin’s, which recorded a net cash outflow of about $56.5 million last week. As Coinpedia had reported , BlackRock’s ETHA has recorded significant cash inflows in the past two weeks, suggesting a strong demand from institutional clients. Altseason Sentiment Ethereum price is well positioned to rally towards a new local high this week fueled by the rising narrative of altseason 2025. With Bitcoin dominance signaling an imminent market reversal, more crypto investors are betting on a major altcoin rally in the near future. Furthermore, the ETH/BTC pair is heavily oversold in the weekly timeframe, amid the recent market reversal. Regulatory Clarity Earlier on Monday, the U.S. Chair Paul Atkins highlighted that American crypto investors have the right to self-custody of crypto assets. Additionally, Chair Atkins highlighted that a new and clear set of DeFi regulations are needed to foster the development of the nascent blockchain technology. With Ethereum harboring the largest DeFi space, with a total value locked (TVL) of about $63 billion and a stablecoins market cap of around $124 billion, the altcoin is well positioned to rally further in the near future.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/top-reasons-why-ethereum-eth-price-will-reach-2800-this-week/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Ethereum",cryptocompare

2025-06-10T00:20:08,"Crypto IPO boom and trade talks fuel Bitcoin’s climb","Bitcoin soared above the $110,000 mark late Monday for the first time in nearly two weeks, buoyed by optimism surrounding renewed trade discussions between the United States and China. The price jump also triggered a wave of short liquidations as the rally gained momentum. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization recently traded at around $110,286 , marking a 3.6% gain over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin is now up nearly 5% over the last seven days, rebounding from a dip below $101,000 on June 5—a pullback that capped a broader decline dating back to late May. With BTC now nearing its all-time high of $111,814 set in May, market watchers are taking note. “Bitcoin breaking above $110,000 for the first time in two weeks signals renewed bullish momentum after a period of consolidation,” said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto investment firm BitBull Capital. “If BTC can hold this level, it may set the stage for a fresh push toward the $120,000 range.” Other major altcoins also rose. Ethereum (ETH), the second cryptocurrency by market cap, gained 4.5% to more than $2,679, and Solana (SOL) added more than 3% to hover close to $160. Even meme coins, which have struggled in recent weeks, showed signs of recovery. Dogecoin jumped 4.5%, and Shiba Inu added 2.5%. Crypto IPO boom and trade talks fuel Bitcoin’s climb The market’s uplift coincides with renewed talks between Washington and Beijing over longstanding trade tariffs—discussions that have soothed broader investor nerves. Investors seem optimistic about the potential for resolving trade disputes between the US and one of its largest trading partners. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and China’s vice premier for economic policy, He Lifeng, will lead their respective delegations in negotiations expected to continue on Tuesday. Equities responded modestly, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 edging slightly on the day. Another factor contributing to Bitcoin’s price surge is increased crypto-related IPOs . Last week, stablecoin giant Circle went public on the New York Stock Exchange and saw its shares pop over 168%, jumping from $31 to $69 within the first day of trading. Gemini, a crypto exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins, also filed for an IPO According to David Siemer, CEO of crypto asset management company Wave Digital Assets, while the IPO bump is likely short-term excitement, the long-term institutional positioning leads us to be bullish about Bitcoin’s continued performance in 2025. Bitcoin shorts crushed as $323M liquidated in a day In the past 24 hours, close to $323 million of crypto short positions have been liquidated, CoinGlass data shows. Most of the damage was in Bitcoin, which saw around $196 million worth of liquidations. The liquidations come amid mounting macroeconomic pressures and renewed trade tensions, which have rattled investor confidence. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen outflows in five of the last seven trading sessions, reflecting the cautious sentiment. In contrast, Ethereum ETFs have enjoyed a streak of positive momentum, notching 15 consecutive days of inflows. 10X Research wrote in a report released Monday morning that Bitcoin is testing a breakout level, and the market setup appears significantly different from what most investors anticipated just weeks ago. According to the report, negative funding rates, a pattern of market bottoms, and a surprising surge in spot demand combine to create a high-conviction signal.

The pseudonymous analyst tells his 548,000 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin is attempting to move into a “price discovery uptrend.” Price discovery often refers to a process when the price of an asset moves to uncharted territory, forcing buyers and sellers to seek agreement on value. Says Rekt Capital, “Bitcoin Price Discovery Roadmap: Bitcoin is currently in a transitional phase. Price is trying to successfully post-breakout retest its ReAccumulation Range to transition into Price Discovery Uptrend 2. A volatile retest/deviation here could occur.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Rekt Capital says that BTC closing above $104,400 on the week could be the key signal that it has successfully retested the demand zone and is gearing up for higher prices. “The retest continues to be successful. Can Bitcoin successfully confirm this retest with a Weekly Close above $104400 for what would be a 4th week in a row?” Zooming in on the daily chart, the trader says that BTC needs to close above its immediate resistance and flip it into support to fully confirm a bullish continuation of the trend. “On the Daily timeframe, Bitcoin is showcasing signs of breaking its two-week Downtrend (light blue) while also turning it into support… Daily Closing & retesting ~$106,600 (black) would be even better to enable trend continuation.” Source: Rekt Capital/X At time of writing, BTC is trading at $105,528.

Despite this, the pace of investments appears to be slowing, as investors grow cautious and await clearer guidance from the US Federal Reserve regarding inflation and the broader direction of monetary policy. According to the latest edition of CoinShares’ Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report, Bitcoin recorded $56.5 million in outflows for a second week, reflecting investor caution amid policy uncertainty. Short-Bitcoin products similarly saw $4.1 million in outflows, which represented their second consecutive week of declining interest. Ethereum continued to lead digital asset investments this week with $296.4 million in inflows, marking its seventh consecutive positive week and totaling $1.5 billion, which is equivalent to 10.5% of total assets under management. This is the strongest streak of inflows since the US election in November, which indicated growing optimism among investors. On the other hand, multi-asset investment products recorded $6.6 million in outflows for the third week running. Altcoins remained mostly flat during the same period, with the exception of Sui and Chainlink, which brought in modest inflows of $1.1 million and $0.2 million. Meanwhile, XRP faced outflows of $4 million, while Solana and Cardano saw $2.1 million and $0.4 million in outflows, respectively. The United States topped weekly inflows with $175 million over the past week, while Germany followed with $47.8 million. Switzerland, Canada, and Australia contributed $15.7 million, $9.8 million, and $6.5 million, respectively. Meanwhile, Brazil recorded $9.2 million in outflows.

BTC formed an ascending channel pattern, suggesting bullish continuation with a 46% upside potential. The 50-week EMA at $85,136 acts as dynamic support, maintaining the long-term bullish structure. Bitcoin’s volatility has dropped to its lowest level in nearly a decade, a sign of a major structural shift in the market’s behavior. According to new data visualized by Ecoinometrics, Bitcoin’s 30-day realized volatility sits near the 10th percentile, meaning current market fluctuations are calmer than 90% of all weekly periods since 2015, suggesting Bitcoin is maturing into a more stable asset even as it continues its strong upward trend. This dramatic decline in volatility, which comes despite a sharp rally in May and the asset reaching new all-time highs, marks a significant change in Bitcoin’s risk profile and could make it far more attractive to a new class of institutional investors.

Despite recent volatility across the crypto market, ETH’s ability to defend this level has kept hopes alive for a potential recovery. Analysts are closely watching Ethereum’s next move, as the asset still trades well below its yearly highs, offering room for upside if momentum returns. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Below $2,800 – Bulls Need This Level To Trigger Next Leg Up Since the start of the year, Ethereum has faced steep declines and inconsistent follow-through on bullish setups.

A breakout above that level would likely open the door for a broader altcoin rally. Top analyst Big Cheds weighed in on the current structure, noting that Ethereum’s weekly chart printed its fourth small-bodied candle in a row — a classic sign of indecision. According to Cheds, ETH “still looks pre-tower top,” suggesting a potential trend shift may be forming. Ethereum Holds Ground As Bulls Face Critical Resistance Ethereum has managed to hold strong above key support levels despite several weeks of market-wide pullback and volatility. Trading above the $2,400–$2,500 zone, ETH has shown resilience while many altcoins have lost momentum. This range has become a critical battleground, with bulls now needing a clean breakout above the $2,800 mark to confirm a return to a bullish phase and potentially kick off the next leg higher. But while the technical structure remains intact for now, macroeconomic headwinds are building. US Treasury yields continue to rise as markets brace for prolonged high interest rates, signaling tighter financial conditions ahead. Combined with ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and sluggish global growth expectations, these factors continue to weigh heavily on risk assets, including crypto. Adding to the cautious tone, top analyst Big Cheds recently highlighted Ethereum’s weakening weekly momentum. According to Cheds, ETH is heading for its fourth consecutive small-bodied weekly candle — a signal of indecision that typically precedes major moves. He notes that the current setup looks pre-tower top, a classic bearish formation that often marks exhaustion at the top of a trend before a sharp reversal. This puts Ethereum at a critical juncture. A decisive breakout above $2,800 would invalidate the bearish scenario and strengthen the case for recovery toward the $3,000–$3,200 range. On the other hand, continued weakness and a failure to gain traction could trigger renewed selling pressure, especially if macro conditions worsen. As Ethereum trades within a tightening range, the next few weeks will be crucial. Whether bulls can flip resistance or bears regain control will likely determine the direction for ETH and the broader altcoin market heading into Q3.

ETH Reclaims Short-Term Support But Faces Overhead Pressure Ethereum is trading at $2,539 on the 4-hour chart, showing a modest rebound of +1.86% on the day. After briefly dipping below its 200 SMA ($2,511), ETH has reclaimed this key level and is now pushing toward the cluster of shorter-term moving averages — including the 34 EMA ($2,528), 50 SMA ($2,543), and 100 SMA ($2,565). This area represents immediate resistance, and how ETH reacts here will likely determine the next short-term trend. Since early May, ETH has been trading in a wide consolidation range between $2,400 and $2,800. The recent price action suggests ongoing indecision, with lower highs forming and strong support holding near the 200 SMA. Volume remains relatively muted, indicating a lack of strong directional conviction. Related Reading: Solana Key Indicator Flashes Buy Signal On Daily Chart – Rally Ahead? For bulls, reclaiming and holding above the 100 SMA is crucial for breaking out of the current range and targeting the $2,700–$2,800 region.

The flagship coin rallied over 4 percent in the last 24 hours to reach a local high of about $110,260, less than 2 percent from its all-time high, on Monday, June 9 during the late North American session. The wider altcoin market, led by Ethereum (ETH), followed in tandem. As a result, the total crypto Open Interest (OI) surged over 6 percent to hover about $154.8 billion at the time of this writing. Additionally, more than $403 million was liquidated from the crypto-leveraged market, led by Bitcoin’s $197 million. Major Factors Influencing the Bitcoin Rally Today Favorable Regulatory Environment As Coinpedia reported , the Chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Paul Atkins, has reiterated the importance of self-custody of crypto assets and clear regulatory frameworks for DeFi protocols. The favoring regulatory frameworks in the United States will have a ripple effect in other countries, thus enabling further crypto adoption by institutional investors. High Demand from Institutional Investors The overall supply of Bitcoin on centralized exchanges has continued to exponentially decline in the past few years, catalyzed by the high demand from institutional investors.

2025-06-09T22:10:35,"Paraguayan President’s X Account Hacked – False Bitcoin Legal Tender Announcement Posted","Key Takeaways: Paraguay’s President Santiago Peña had his official X account compromised, leading to the spread of a false announcement about Bitcoin. The language and content of the post raised immediate red flags among observers, prompting swift clarification from the Paraguayan government. On-chain analysis showed the attached wallet had minimal funds and no activity, suggesting a phishing attempt. Paraguay’s President, Santiago Peña, became the latest high-profile figure to fall victim to a social media hack after his official X account was compromised on Monday. The breach resulted in a fake announcement claiming the country had adopted Bitcoin as legal tender. Paraguay Denies Bitcoin Legal Tender Claim After Presidential Account Hack The message, written unusually in English rather than Spanish, declared that Paraguay had made Bitcoin an official currency. It also claimed the government had created a $5 million BTC reserve and launched a bond program for “crypto-enabled citizens.” The post urged users to send any amount of Bitcoin to a wallet address, supposedly to determine the scale of a national rollout. https://twitter.com/SantiPenap/status/1932125390153396541 Observers quickly flagged the message as suspicious. Many noted that the language and tone were inconsistent with previous communications from the president, who typically posts in Spanish. Shortly after the post went live, the platform flagged the account for “irregular activity,” according to an additional report. The Paraguayan government swiftly issued an official response. The presidential account posted a message in Spanish that read: “Información falsa. Comunicado oficial de la presidencia de la República del Paraguay.” This statement confirmed that the Bitcoin announcement was false. Comunicado oficial. pic.twitter.com/Bk3XI6ohpp — Presidencia Paraguay (@PresidenciaPy) June 9, 2025 However, the hacker attempted to conceal the government’s warning by hiding the official reply beneath the scam post. The fraudulent message remained live for a time, possibly misleading unsuspecting users. On-chain data revealed that the wallet address provided by the hacker held only $4 and had recorded no transactions since the announcement. Despite the low activity, the nature of the post resembled a classic crypto phishing scheme. Authorities urged the public not to trust any posts from the president’s account until further notice. Paraguay’s national cybersecurity team has launched an investigation and is working with X to resolve the incident and restore control over the account. “We ask citizens to ignore any messages from the presidential account until we confirm its security,” the government said. Ongoing Crypto Scam Wave Hits Political and Industry Targets Across Latin America The hacking of Paraguayan President Santiago Peña’s official X account adds to a growing string of high-profile social media compromises, many of which have targeted the crypto industry and public figures to spread misinformation and scams. Over the past year, threat actors have increasingly exploited X for crypto-related phishing attacks. In May 2025 alone, the X accounts of Ethereum Layer-2 project ZKsync and its developer Matter Labs, were breached . @zksync & @the_matter_labs official X accounts hacked to post fake SEC alerts & phishing airdrops—ZK token drops 5%. #zksync #sec #phishing https://t.co/j4Yx6HHaob — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 13, 2025 Hackers posted fraudulent messages claiming the protocol was under U.S. investigation and shared phishing links disguised as airdrops. Around the same time, the New York Post’s account was hijacked to impersonate journalists and lure crypto users into fake podcast offers via Telegram. Earlier in the year, Canadian regulators also flagged fake articles featuring political endorsements used to promote crypto scams. State-sponsored hackers from the Lazarus Group have also posed as VCs in fake Zoom meetings to steal users’ private keys.” Paraguay has shown no intention to follow El Salvador’s 2021 move, which remains in a legal gray area following an IMF agreement reached in late 2024. Meanwhile, Paraguay’s crypto scene is under pressure. As Bitcoin mining gains traction, thanks to the country’s hydroelectric surplus, regulatory tensions are rising. Industrial players warn that new electricity rates could drive miners away . With over 10,000 illicit mining rigs seized in 2024 and tensions rising around mining regulations, the misuse of official platforms for misinformation poses a real threat to public understanding in an already volatile sector.

Terrett tells her 238,200 followers on the social media platform X that the statement is “imminent.” “NEW: I’m hearing that a joint statement is imminent from the eight leading crypto trade associations, along with Uniswap and Jump, expressing their support for the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act (BRCA) being included in the latest version of the CLARITY Act.” The BRCA aims to provide clarity and certainty for developers, miners, and other innovators in the non-custodial crypto ecosystem. According to Terrett, the eight groups are the DeFi Education Fund, Coin Center, Solana Institute, Chamber of Digital Commerce, Blockchain Association, Crypto Council, Bitcoin Policy Institute and Paradigm, who say that the legislation is critical for protecting software developers and infrastructure providers who do not custody customer funds. “The amendment, originally introduced by GOP Majority Whip and now with bipartisan support from Rep Ritchie, is being viewed by many in the industry as a foundational policy safeguard for DeFi developers. ‘It’s critically important that we don’t treat open-source developers like traditional financial institutions,’ one policy lead told me. ‘The BRCA draws that line clearly and protects innovation.’ The joint statement urges lawmakers to include the BRCA in the CLARITY Act, the House’s digital asset market structure bill, which is expected to be marked up next week.” At time of writing, no statement has been issued.

2025-06-09T22:00:33,"Is Altcoin Season Still Coming? Why Bitcoin Is To Blame Despite Making ATHs","Despite Bitcoin’s historic rise above the $100,000 mark in early 2025, a growing number of crypto investors are left wondering when the long-anticipated altcoin season will begin. At the time of writing, the altcoin season index from BlockchainCenter has now dipped to a reading of 20, far below the 75 threshold typically required to confirm the start of an altcoin season. In a detailed post on social media platform X, van de Poppe addressed what is one of the most frequently asked questions in the crypto industry today: “When altseason?” Altcoin Season Missing Despite Bull Market Conditions According to analyst Michaël van de Poppe, this cycle has deviated significantly from historical patterns. His response to the growing question of an altcoin season relays the fact that while Bitcoin has made gains, the altcoin market continues to lag significantly behind, raising doubts about whether a true altseason will even arrive this cycle. Related Reading: Certified Analyst Says Bitcoin Dominance Could Reverse At 64% – Is It Time For Altcoin Season? In past cycles, altcoins followed Bitcoin’s rally within weeks or months. However, 2024 and the early part of 2025 have proven to be different. This, in turn, has been many investors expecting this cycle to play out the same getting hammered and losing their patience. Although some new meme coins had their brief moments of explosive growth in late 2024, the broader altcoin market has been largely suppressed since late 2021. Van de Poppe explains that most older altcoins failed to match Bitcoin’s performance in 2021, and that trend has only worsened in the current cycle. This has somewhat changed the expectation of a typical four-year cycle rhythm. The tables have turned and other variables need to be taken into account for investors looking to get a significant return in those markets. Bitcoin Dominance And Sentiment Imbalance Holding Altcoins Back One of the clearest reasons for the delay in altseason is Bitcoin’s overwhelming dominance. As the Altcoin Season Index indicates, the metric remains significantly below the 25 threshold line and firmly entrenched in Bitcoin Season territory. Van de Poppe attributes this not just to price action, but also to macro-level shifts, such as interest rate regimes and monetary policy from central banks. For now, there’s still much upside potential for Bitcoin, especially if the Fed interest rates were to go down from their current 4% levels. Related Reading: Is Altcoin Season Over Or It Never Started? Here’s What Historical Data Says In his view, the current market is divided into two camps: those expecting a bear market and those who believe the bull run is just beginning. Both could be wrong, he warns, because the game has changed. If there are so many factors going into negative sentiment, that’s actually a sign to allocate funds into altcoins. Keeping this in mind, the best time to invest in altcoins would be now, when the altcoin season isn’t showing any signs. Van de Poppe concludes that altseason isn’t just a timeframe but a phase where patient investors accumulate undervalued cryptocurrencies before the rest of the market catches on. When the altcoin season eventually rolls in, it will come unannounced.

The largest crypto advanced by 3.7% over the past 24 hours, topping $110,000, and it's changing hands by only 2% from its record prices observed in May. Ethereum's ether ETH kept pace with a 3.8% gain during the same period, bouncing above $2,620. Native tokens of Hyperliquid HYPE and SUI SUI outperformed most large-cap cryptocurrencies, rising 7% and 4.5%, respectively. Bitcoin's move higher caught leveraged traders off-guard, liquidating over $110 million worth of short positions within an hour, CoinGlass data shows. Across all crypto assets, some $330 million of shorts were liquidated during the day, the most in a month. Shorts are seeking to profit from declining asset prices. The move happened while traditional markets showed muted action, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes flat on the day. Crypto-related stocks bounced during the session to catch up with BTC's recovery over the weekend. ""A 'peaceful rally' is a perfect way to describe this price action,"" said well-followed analyst Caleb Franzen, founder of Cubic Analytics. ""Just a consistent development of higher highs and higher lows. Any signs of weakness? Buyers step in and defend the trend.""

However, on-chain data indicates rising sell pressure from long-term holders that could overwhelm demand, the analysts added. “Bitcoin is now at a crossroads—balanced between structural support and waning bullish momentum, waiting for its next macro cue,” the Bitfinex note added. Those macro catalysts may come later this week, noted Jake O, OTC trader at crypto trading firm Wintermute.

2025-06-09T21:30:51,"Bernstein Analysts Say Ethereum Is the Face of Blockchain Innovation","Analysts at Bernstein believe the digital market is changing. While Bitcoin (BTC) is still leading the crypto market, something new is happening. Big financial companies now use public blockchains like Ethereum (ETH) to build new financial tools. Analysts think this is only the beginning of how traditional finance will grow using blockchain. Bitcoin Leads, But Ethereum is Catching Up Bitcoin, seen as a safe haven , continues to be the most well-known cryptocurrency. In early 2024, Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were launched in the U.S. and quickly became very popular. These funds now manage over $120 billion in assets. Ethereum ETFs were launched later but have seen less capital inflow, about $9 billion. This is expected because the coin is still smaller than Bitcoin in total value. Even so, interest in Ethereum is rising. Spot Ethereum ETFs reportedly saw their third consecutive week of inflows . This shows that more people are starting to see the value in Ethereum. Analysts Think ETH Is More Than Just a Coin Bernstein analysts think Ethereum is different from Bitcoin. Bitcoin is mainly seen as a way to store value, like gold. Ethereum is like a computer that anyone can use. People can build apps and financial tools on it. Two primary uses of ETH are stablecoins and tokenization. Stablecoins are digital dollars that are easy to send and use. Tokenization means turning real-world things, like property or stocks, into digital tokens—these run mainly on the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum is Gaining Value Through Use Some investors used to say that crypto is not valuable, but blockchain is. Now, they are starting to see that both are connected. If stablecoins and tokens are helpful, then the network that powers them, like ETH, is also valuable. Ethereum earns fees when people use its apps. This means there is real demand for the network. Big names in finance and tech are now using ETH’s features. Companies like Visa, Mastercard, and Stripe are working on ways to use stablecoins for payments. These stablecoins often run on the ETH network. Crypto companies are also building more valuable products. Coinbase is testing stablecoin payments for businesses. Robinhood is working on turning real-world assets into tokens. Kraken plans to let international users trade tokenized U.S. stocks. These are not just crypto trading tools but financial products built on blockchain. This means ETH is now part of real financial innovation, not just online coin trading. As more companies and users build on Ethereum , it becomes more important and valuable.

2025-06-09T21:22:35,"Malaysia’s Crypto Mining to Soar 110% in 2025 as $100 Million Power Theft Persists","A new report by the ACCESS Blockchain Association of Malaysia predicts a sharp rise in legal mining activity, driven by infrastructure investment, expanding data center capacity, and increased institutional interest. Yet, electricity theft tied to illegal mining operations continues to erode grid stability and investor confidence. According to the report, the national utility provider Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) stated that Malaysia suffered power losses exceeding RM441 million ($100M) between 2020 and 2024, largely due to unauthorized mining setups siphoning electricity directly from the grid. These illicit operations, often concealed in residential or commercial buildings, not only endanger public safety but also place additional stress on the country’s power infrastructure. The ACCESS report notes that Malaysia has the potential to benefit economically from crypto mining, but must first resolve internal regulatory and infrastructural challenges to fully realize that opportunity. Malaysia’s Mining Growth Potential Undermined by Regulatory Gaps and Illicit Activity Malaysia’s persistent regulatory ambiguity and hidden illegal operations continue to stall the progress of its cryptocurrency mining industry, according to a new report by the ACCESS Blockchain Association. The report estimates that formalizing the sector could lead to RM700 million in hardware and infrastructure investments this year alone, creating up to 4,000 jobs and contributing approximately RM150 million in annual tax revenue. Despite these prospects, many legal operators remain under the radar due to security concerns and policy uncertainty. Source: ACCESS Blockchain Association Malaysia currently ranks among the top 10 countries globally by Bitcoin hash rate share. The country’s competitive industrial electricity rates, particularly in East Sarawak, have made it an attractive destination for crypto mining. However, the absence of a mining-specific license continues to hamper broader industry development. While the Securities Commission (SC) oversees digital asset trading and custody, no regulatory body governs the mining process. This has left industry participants facing unclear electricity tariffs, licensing requirements, and environmental compliance standards. “Crucially, while the SC regulates the digital assets that miners produce, if deemed securities and traded or offered in Malaysia—its current guidelines do not appear to provide a specific regulatory framework or licensing regime for the act of mining itself,” the report noted. “The focus remains on the exchange, offering, and safekeeping of assets post-creation. This lack of a dedicated mining framework is a major source of regulatory uncertainty.” Urgent Need for Reform to Tackle Illegal Mining and Build a Sustainable Industry Malaysia’s mining industry mirrors a regional pattern. Countries like Thailand and Indonesia are also grappling with illegal operations and infrastructure abuse. According to a report, incidents of power theft linked to unauthorized mining operations jumped nearly 300% between 2018 and 2024, with 2,397 cases recorded. The spike has drawn concern from Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB), the national utility provider, and threatens to undercut investor confidence in the digital asset sector’s long-term viability. There were 610 detected cases of power thefts in 2018, linked to illegal crypto mining, which surged to 2,397 in 2024, Malaysia TNB noted. #MalaysiaCryptoMining #BitcoinMining #ElectricityConsumption https://t.co/Xmnl4pXXhx — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 12, 2025 The ACCESS report recommends a coordinated strategy that includes the introduction of dedicated mining licenses, reforms to landlord liability laws, and energy pricing models tied to sustainability metrics. While TNB has initiated efforts to roll out smart meters and deploy data analytics tools to detect unauthorized consumption, enforcement remains fragmented across multiple government bodies, weakening overall deterrence. One of the report’s key proposals is the development of Shariah-compliant mining models. Given Malaysia’s leadership in Islamic finance, the report suggests leveraging this advantage by creating ethical mining operations that prioritize transparent governance and renewable energy.

Earlier on Monday during the mid-North American trading session, the X account for President Peña indicated that Paraguay had adopted Bitcoin as a legal tender in addition to creating a strategic BTC reserve and bond access for crypto assets. According to the X post, which was later deleted, the Paraguay government had created a $5 million Bitcoin reserve. However, the Paraguay government disputed the claims as no such move was underway. Currently, the Paraguay lawmakers are focused solely on regulating the crypto mining sector and virtual assets exchanges to enhance tax collection. Bitcoin Price Gains Bullish Momentum Following the fake news from Paraguay, Bitcoin price surged over 2 percent to reach a local high of about $108,702. The wider altcoin market, led by Ethereum (ETH), recorded bullish sentiment, thus the total crypto valuation surged to $3.51 trillion at the time of this writing.
