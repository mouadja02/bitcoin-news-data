2025-06-10T19:55:34,"Trader Predicts Parabolic Sui Rally to New Highs, Says Recent $223,000,000 DEX Hack Gave ‘Amazing Opportunity’","A widely followed crypto analyst says that layer-1 blockchain Sui ( SUI ) is gearing up for a massive breakout to fresh all-time highs. In a new thread, pseudonymous crypto trader Kaleo tells his 703,900 followers on the social media platform X that SUI is suddenly presenting a major buying opportunity. He says that the recent $223 million hack of the Cetus Protocol, a decentralized exchange (DEX) operating on the Sui network, caused SUI’s value to decline, but ultimately gave bulls a chance to position themselves for the next leg up. “Remember last cycle how many times SOL was declared dead because it went down? Every single time the FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) was bought, and it came back stronger. I think the recent CETUS exploit gave an amazing opportunity for a dip to stack more SUI. CETUS is officially back with a recovery plan for affected pools. There’s also a plan in place for token compensation for affected users. If anything, the CETUS issue makes me more bullish showing how SUI governance was swift to act together to stop the protocol’s exploit from being any worse and allowing the hacker to get away with the funds. Feel free to cope from the sidelines, but I’m as bullish as I’ve been since I partnered with SUI on them having the opportunity to fill the gap in the monolithic L1 (layer-1) race. Run it back turbo.” Source: Kaleo/X Based on his chart, the trader appears to suggest that SUI print a new all-time high at around $7.50, more than double its current value, perhaps sometime in September of this year. The analyst also says that SUI may be getting ready to breakout of a bullish descending wedge pattern against Bitcoin ( BTC ). “SUI/BTC ratio also looks solid with a clean breakout retest. I see this breaking out and filling the launch wick soon.” Source: Kaleo/X At time of writing, SUI is trading for $3.45.

This amount is over $23 million according to the current market value. The accumulation in question stands out as a significant reserve that the company has not previously disclosed to the public. American Bitcoin launched in March, and Eric Trump serves as the company's chief strategy officer. “Our vision for American Bitcoin is to create the most investable BTC accumulation platform on the market,” Eric Trump said in a statement.

American Bitcoin said it considers its BTC reserves a “core strategic asset” and that it is being managed adaptively. The firm’s goal is to bolster its balance sheet strength and increase long-term shareholder value. The company’s accumulation strategy is not a specific BTC target, but instead plans to expand its assets by increasing capital according to market conditions. The company stated that “BTC accumulation is not a byproduct of ABTC’s business; it is the business itself,” and announced that their Layer 2 strategy aims to transform Bitcoin production into long-term ownership. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-10T19:27:24,"SEC may approve Solana ETF in coming weeks: report","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission may approve a spot Solana exchange-traded fund within the next few months, according to multiple sources cited by Blockworks. The SEC has reportedly asked prospective Solana ( SOL ) ETF issuers to submit amended S-1 registration statements by next week. One source suggested an approval could arrive within three to five weeks. Two sources told Blockworks the agency will provide comments on the updated filings within 30 days. The changes focus on two key areas: how issuers plan to handle in-kind redemptions and whether staking will be incorporated into the ETF structure. Notably, the SEC is said to be open to allowing staking as part of these products. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart commented that approval could come as early as July, though the final deadlines for SEC decisions, based on the 240-day review period, extend to October. Seyffart said the agency may now be prioritizing 19b-4 filings related to Solana and staking ETFs sooner than originally expected. Several asset managers are lining up to offer a Solana ETF, including VanEck, Bitwise, Fidelity, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, Canary Capital, and 21Shares.

The SEC formally acknowledged Grayscale’s Solana ETF proposal in February, a significant shift given its past resistance to such filings. While the SEC delayed its decision on Grayscale’s Solana ETF in May, it stated it had not yet reached any conclusions. The delay was seen as procedural rather than a rejection. Market observers took that as a positive sign, particularly after CME launched SOL futures in February, mirroring steps taken ahead of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF approvals. CME’s launch of SOL futures has already led to the introduction of SOL futures ETFs, including two from Volatility Shares . Following the historic approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 and Ethereum ETFs in May 2025, attention has now turned to other top digital assets like Solana. The very existence of futures markets often paves the way for spot ETF approval, as seen with BTC and ETH.

Reaching this level would represent a 336% rally from XRP’s price of $2.29 as of press time. Indeed, the move will be massively bullish, considering that XRP has struggled to establish itself above the $2.30 resistance level despite. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Now, in a June 8 TradingView post , Persian Blockchain emphasized that the outcome of the ongoing lawsuit between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) remains one of the most significant catalysts for XRP’s future trajectory. With a court-imposed 60-day deadline approaching on June 16, speculation is growing that Ripple may secure a favorable ruling. Such an outcome could restore investor confidence and remove a long-standing obstacle to XRP’s upside potential. Notably, both parties are pushing for a settlement after an initial application was rejected due to procedural issues . On the macroeconomic front, the analyst pointed to a renewed expansion in global liquidity, as tracked by the M2 Global Liquidity Index. Rising liquidity has historically supported risk assets, particularly cryptocurrencies. XRP price levels to watch Technically, the trading expert noted that XRP appears well-positioned and is forming a bullish flag pattern, a continuation setup often preceding sharp upward moves. After months of consolidation within a downward-sloping channel, XRP looks ready to challenge key resistance levels. The analysis outlined several bullish Fibonacci extension targets, including $3.64, $4.47, $6.27, and a long-term target of $11.25, with the psychological $10 level firmly within range. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Crucially, the breakout zone between $2.79 and $3.07 is a trigger area; flipping this range into support could signal a higher vertical move. Investors should watch for a confirmed breakout followed by a retest, ideally bouncing from the accumulation zone, to validate the move. “A perfect storm of fundamentals and technical. A retest of the breakout area followed by bullish confirmation could signal the beginning of a larger move toward the $10 psychological level,” the analyst said. If XRP reaches the $10 mark, its market cap will surge to approximately $587 billion, potentially making it the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin ( BTC ), assuming Ethereum sees minimal growth over the same period.

Will his a16z and Kalshi ties raise red flags as the Senate reviews his nomination? Table of Contents Brian Quintenz faces Senate for CFTC chair role Quintenz’s career and blockchain expertise CFTC peers back Quintenz for chair role CFTC prepares for digital assets oversight Brian Quintenz faces Senate for CFTC chair role Brian Quintenz , President Donald Trump ’s nominee to chair the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, is scheduled to appear before the Senate on Jun. 10 as lawmakers assess his qualifications to lead an agency preparing for expanded oversight of cryptocurrency markets. The CFTC is currently operating with only two Senate-confirmed commissioners. Rostin Behnam stepped down in February, followed by the departures of Summer Mersinger and Christy Goldsmith Romero by May 31. Acting Chair Caroline Pham is also expected to exit once Quintenz is confirmed, leaving the agency at a pivotal moment with both leadership structure and regulatory direction in transition. Quintenz’s nomination has already drawn attention due to financial disclosures submitted on May 25. The filings reveal he holds $3.4 million in assets, including investments in multiple Andreessen Horowitz crypto funds — CNK Fund III, CNK Seed 1 Fund, and CNK IV Fund — as well as stock options in Kalshi , a prediction market platform where he serves on the board. Kalshi recently won a legal case against the CFTC in May 2025, securing permission to offer contracts tied to election outcomes. Since the CFTC regulates both crypto derivatives and prediction markets, ethics advocates have raised concerns over potential conflicts of interest. In a letter dated May 21 addressed to CFTC Ethics Official John Einstman, Quintenz pledged to divest from all relevant financial interests within 90 days of confirmation. He also committed to recusing himself from any CFTC matters involving Andreessen Horowitz for two years and Kalshi for one year. Critics contend that these measures may not fully resolve the conflict concerns. The upcoming Senate hearing is expected to examine those questions closely, weighing Quintenz’s industry background and prior CFTC experience against concerns around impartiality and long-term regulatory independence. Quintenz’s career and blockchain expertise Quintenz has built a career that spans traditional finance, public service, and blockchain policy, with each phase shaping his approach to regulation in evolving markets. Born in 1977, he studied economics at Duke University and began his professional life as a congressional aide. He later founded Saeculum Capital Management, a hedge fund focused on derivatives trading. His public service began in full when he was nominated to the CFTC under both the Obama and Trump administrations. The Senate unanimously confirmed him in August 2017, and he served as commissioner until 2021. During his tenure at the agency, he chaired the Technology Advisory Committee and oversaw several landmark developments, including the launch of the first regulated Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) futures contracts. He also helped initiate early policy discussions on decentralized finance and tokenized assets, consistently advocating for a risk-based oversight model that promotes innovation while upholding market integrity and investor protection. After stepping down from the CFTC in August 2021, Quintenz entered the private sector with a focus on crypto. He joined Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto division, initially as an advisory partner, and by December 2022, he became its global head of policy. At a16z Crypto, he worked on developing regulatory frameworks for blockchain platforms and helped guide portfolio companies such as Coinbase, Solana ( SOL ), and Maker ( MKR ) through engagement with policymakers. His role in the private sector also extended to prediction markets. In November 2021, he joined the board of Kalshi, a platform for trading outcomes of real-world events. He also served as an advisor to Crypto.com between 2021 and 2022. In a 2021 interview with Bloomberg, he described event-based markets as tools that allow people to price probabilities more transparently and push back against misinformation. His broader view of blockchain’s role in society became especially clear on Jun. 10. He described blockchain as a horizontal technology with potential applications beyond finance, including supply chains, governance systems, and digital identity infrastructure. He also called on Congress to provide legal clarity around token classifications and agency responsibilities, arguing that regulatory certainty is necessary both to protect consumers and to ensure the United States remains globally competitive in emerging technology. CFTC peers back Quintenz for chair role Reactions to Brian Quintenz’s nomination have revealed a clear divide. Supporters emphasize his experience and previous contributions to digital asset regulation, while critics continue to raise concerns about his industry ties and potential conflicts of interest. Caroline Pham, Acting Chair of the CFTC, publicly endorsed Quintenz’s return to the agency. In a LinkedIn post published on Feb. 12, she wrote, “I worked with Brian on important initiatives that he led to success as a CFTC commissioner. He will do the same for crypto and innovation.” Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, expressed similar support. In a post on X dated Dec. 12 last year, he called Quintenz “an amazing pick” potentially referring to his earlier role in crypto futures markets as evidence of forward-looking and informed regulatory thinking. Brian Quintenz would be an amazing pick for CFTC https://t.co/CiYdFZHedV — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) December 12, 2024 Former CFTC Chair Chris Giancarlo also weighed in on the day of the nomination. He stated that “Quintenz’s understanding of the Commodity Exchange Act and digital assets ensures he’ll craft regulations that foster innovation without compromising market integrity.” Criticism, however, has focused largely on Quintenz’s financial disclosures. Opponents continue to question his investments in Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto funds and his board position at Kalshi, particularly given the CFTC’s oversight of both crypto derivatives and prediction markets. CFTC prepares for digital assets oversight The CFTC is entering a crucial phase that could redefine its role in financial oversight, particularly in the area of digital assets. Traditionally focused on regulating derivatives markets, the agency has overseen Bitcoin and Ethereum futures since 2017 but has had a limited role in spot crypto markets. Its involvement in that space has been largely confined to cases involving fraud or manipulation. That boundary may be shifting. During President Donald Trump’s second term, the administration is signaling support for expanding the CFTC’s mandate, backed by legislative proposals and a broader pro-crypto regulatory outlook. One of the most consequential efforts is the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act. First introduced in 2023 and gaining traction in 2025, the bill aims to define digital commodities and grant the CFTC regulatory authority over their spot markets. Industry participants have long cited regulatory uncertainty as a barrier to growth, particularly in response to the enforcement-heavy approach taken by the Securities and Exchange Commission under former Chair Gary Gensler. The proposed legislation would position the CFTC as the lead agency for digital commodities such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, giving it a more central role in shaping the crypto economy. Legal developments may be aligning in the agency’s favor, but practical challenges remain. The CFTC’s 2025 budget stands at $365 million, significantly lower than the SEC’s $2.4 billion. Expanding its jurisdiction without a corresponding increase in resources could limit its ability to deliver on new responsibilities. Leadership capacity is also stretched. Once Caroline Pham steps down, only Commissioner Kristin Johnson will remain. Quintenz’s confirmation would fill a crucial gap, but it also concentrates decision-making at a time when the agency’s direction is still being negotiated. The CFTC’s future will depend not only on who leads it, but also on whether it is equipped with the authority, personnel, and funding needed to carry out a broader mandate. Without those elements, efforts to modernize oversight may fall short of their intended impact.",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/brian-quintenz-cftc-nomination-conflict/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION","Feature|CFTC|Donald Trump|Regulation",cryptocompare

This metric, showing the price gap between Coinbase’s BTC/USD and Binance’s BTC/USDT quotes, is a popular proxy for gauging U.S. retail buyer appetite. On Friday, the Coinbase Premium touched $109.55—its largest spread since February 3. Earlier this week, CryptoQuant contributor “Crypto Dan” in a Quicktake update described the pattern as characteristic of early-cycle recovery after correction, without signs of overheating. This suggested continued bullish momentum into the second half of 2025. Simultaneously, institutional interest appears to be rebounding. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, especially BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), are drawing significant inflows and currently lead in assets under management. CryptoQuant also highlighted a notable decline in on‑chain BTC reserves on exchanges. Since July 2024, over 500,000 coins have exited spot exchange holdings. Baykuş, another CryptoQuant contributor, noted this trend is no accident. “People aren’t selling—they’re holding. They’re not day trading, they’re holding for the long term.” He framed this movement as a hidden foundation supporting the current rally toward $110,000. Taken together, increasing retail premiums on Coinbase, strengthening institutional inflows into ETFs, and dwindling exchange supply paint a bullish outlook for Bitcoin’s price.

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) says Jalen Tylee Hill, 26, stole numerous checks out of residential and commercial mailboxes in Georgia. Hill would then recruit people on Facebook by offering to deposit the stolen checks into their bank accounts on the condition that they would split half the funds. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Georgia says Hill stole hundreds of pieces of mail, participated in at least 68 instances of bank fraud and illegally used other people’s debit cards on at least 14 occasions. “Hill then deposited, or attempted to deposit, the numerous stolen, forged or otherwise fraudulent checks of more than ten financial institutions into other bank accounts, resulting in an intended loss of approximately $165,743.68. As part of another scheme discovered by investigators, Hill created a fake solar panel installation company recruiting page online from which he stole the identities of 28 individuals, including their driver’s licenses, Social Security cards, birth certificates, instructional permits and other documents depicting personally identifiable information.” Last year, Hill pled guilty to one count of bank fraud, one count of aggravated identity theft and one count of conspiracy to possess stolen mail. Fourteen other codefendants have also been convicted for their participation in Hill’s scheme.

In a new interview with CNBC, Goldman Sachs executive David Kostin says “hard data” may soon override some of the “soft data” that has caused uncertainty in markets. “Well, the equity market traditionally trades more on the soft data than on the hard data. And the expectation is that we’ve had a weak bout of soft data—maybe some of that may be turning…” Kostin says in the short term, US equities may face downside as tariff-driven uncertainty materializes, but that by the end of the year, he’s looking at about a 10% performance on the S&P 500. He also says a recession is not in the bank’s base case forecast. “In the next month or two, you get some hard data. It will be weaker. You get some uncertainty around the earnings. The blackout period for company share repurchases basically ends later this week or the early part of next week. In terms of the month before earnings season, companies are still able to repurchase – discretionarily – their shares. So these are some of the variables, the signposts you’re looking at. We’re looking at them, clients are looking at them. Looking out further into next year, the economy is likely to continue to grow. We don’t have a recession in the forecast – that’s not the base case. And therefore, you’ve got earnings growth. Seven per cent this year, another 7% next year. That lifts the market to around 6500. Sixty-five hundred is roughly up nearly 10%.

2025-06-10T18:39:27,"Institutions fuel BTC’s rise, analysts see RUVI as a smarter bet for newcomers","Bitcoin (BTC), the pioneer of cryptocurrency, continues its upward trajectory, largely fueled by institutional investors who have embraced it as a digital store of value. While this institutional support has cemented Bitcoin’s status as a market leader, its high price and slower growth potential leave little room for newcomers seeking quick, high returns. Enter Ruvi AI, a blockchain project with tremendous upside, practical applications, and an accessible entry price of $0.015 per token in Phase 2 of its presale. Analysts see Ruvi AI as an intelligent choice for savvy investors ready to capture early-stage crypto growth. Bitcoin’s institutional momentum and its drawbacks for newcomers Unlike its early days, Bitcoin’s current boom is driven by institutional players such as hedge funds, corporations, and even governments acquiring significant holdings. This influx of institutional money has added legitimacy to Bitcoin, stabilizing its position as a long-term asset. However, Bitcoin’s significant price tag and market saturation create barriers for new investors hoping for substantial short-term gains. BTC’s growth has slowed compared to its explosive early years, making large returns improbable for those joining now.

In a filing submitted to the SEC, the company, formally known as ABTC, said that it views Bitcoin as a long-term asset and intends to continue increasing its holdings. American Bitcoin, backed by the TRUMP FAMILY, is making BIG moves. It quietly grabbed 215 $BTC ($23M) since April. Which other company is buying BTC quietly? 👇 pic.twitter.com/rcQvCgd8DL — Wise Advice (@wiseadvicesumit) June 10, 2025 “Bitcoin accumulation is not a side effect of ABTC’s business. It is the business. ABTC’s Layer 2 strategy is designed to transform its Bitcoin production into long-term Bitcoin ownership” , it wrote. American Bitcoin to produce Bitcoin below-market cost ABTC said in the filing that it spends directly on mining instead of investing in physical infrastructure. The company has more than 60,000 miners, mostly from Bitmain and MicroBT, spread out across three facilities in New York, Alberta, and Texas, handled by Hut 8. These miners do a total of 10.17 exahashes every second and use an average of 21.2 joules per terahash. Through its partnership with Hut 8, ABTC can keep costs low while increasing output and keeping its capital flexible. “ABTC’s foundation is built on producing Bitcoin below-market cost through a capital efficient, infrastructure-light operating model,” it wrote. The miners who work for ABTC add their computing power to well-known pools like Foundry and Luxor. Daily mining rewards are given out based on how much hashrate is contributed, and pool fees are kept below 1%. “ABTC’s goal is to utilize public markets and strategic financing structures to access efficient capital and leverage that capital to increase its Bitcoin in reserve per share,” it wrote ABTC has what it calls a “three-tiered strategy” at its core. This means creating a mining business that works well and doesn’t cost too much, using capital to increase its Bitcoin reserves, and getting involved in Bitcoin’s larger ecosystem. The Bitcoin ABTC stores with Coinbase Custody are kept in “cold wallets.” To make the storage more secure, the company uses multifactor authentication and whitelisted withdrawal methods. The Gryphon merger is still in the picture American Bitcoin said in May that it would go public by merging with Gryphon Digital Mining. The agreement is set up as a stock-for-stock deal, and the combined company will use the American Bitcoin brand. After the deal, Eric Trump will be on the company board. Also, Hut 8 owns most of American Bitcoin and will still have a management role after the merger. As per the deal, current American Bitcoin shareholders will own around 98% of the new business. Hut 8 will keep running the mines and handling their infrastructure. They hope to make steady money through long-term business deals. Meanwhile, BTC users have shown excitement. Tectum has said , “Bitcoin holdings grow, and so does the need for efficient ways to use them.” On the other hand, Alva has warned that BTC is holding strong above key moving averages, and US accumulation trends continue fueling bullish sentiment without direct confirmation of high-profile political buyers. “Social buzz is amped up, with political narratives keeping traders alert to possible big inflows. Volume signals steady demand, but watch RSI for overbought hints. If the political narrative really heats up, a technical breakout could follow—are you ready for the next volatility burst?” Ava added.

2025-06-10T18:09:20,"Five fraudsters plead guilty in $37M crypto scheme","In a significant development in the fight against cryptocurrency fraud, five individuals have pleaded guilty to their roles in a multinational scam that defrauded victims of approximately $37 million. This case, prosecuted by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), underscores the growing threat of crypto-related crimes and the increasing efforts by law enforcement to hold perpetrators accountable. As digital currencies continue to gain popularity, so do the schemes designed to exploit unsuspecting investors. A multinational crypto scam The $36.9 million cryptocurrency fraud scheme targeted American citizens through a sophisticated operation that leveraged social media, dating apps, and messaging platforms to build trust with victims. According to reports, the scammers posed as legitimate investment advisors or romantic interests, convincing individuals to invest in fake cryptocurrency opportunities. Once trust was established through prolonged communication via calls and texts, the fraudsters directed victims to transfer funds to shell companies or fraudulent platforms, after which the money was funneled out of the country, ultimately being sent to Cambodia. The five individuals who pleaded guilty admitted to various roles in the operation, including orchestrating the scam, laundering money, and managing the deceptive communications with victims. Joseph Wong, Yicheng Zhang, Jose Somarriba, Shengsheng He, and Jingliang Su, who pleaded guilty, were scattered in multiple countries, including the US, Spain, China, and Turkey. Zhang and Wong face 20-year prison sentences for money laundering conspiracy charges. The other three fraudsters could receive up to 5-year sentences for operating an unlicensed money services business. Zhang and Su have been in custody since November 2024, with Su scheduled to face a sentencing hearing in November. The number of people who have pleaded guilty to this crypto scam operation has reached 8, with Daren Li and Lu Zhang who pleaded guilty on money laundering charges in 2024. The rise of cryptocurrency fraud Cryptocurrency fraud has become a pressing issue as digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum gain mainstream adoption. The decentralized and often anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies makes them an attractive tool for criminals. According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), consumers reported losing over $1 billion to crypto scams between January 2021 and March 2022 alone. These scams often take the form of investment fraud, romance scams, or phishing schemes designed to steal personal information or funds. The $37 million scam is just one of many high-profile cases in recent years. For instance, the DOJ has also pursued cases involving larger sums, such as a $1.89 billion cryptocurrency fraud scheme announced in January 2024, where three individuals were charged or pleaded guilty. These cases demonstrate a pattern of sophisticated operations that prey on the lack of regulation and public understanding of digital currencies. As reported by Cointelegraph, the methods used in the $37 million scam are consistent with a growing trend of ‘pig butchering’ scams, where fraudsters build long-term relationships with victims before convincing them to invest in fraudulent schemes.

2025-06-10T18:07:03,"Bitcoin’s OP_RETURN Limit Soars to Nearly 4MB in Core 30 Update","The Bitcoin Core development team has announced a major update in the upcoming October Core 30 release. The changes will increase the OP_RETURN data limit from 80 bytes to nearly 4 MB. Community Debate The proposal removes the long-standing default size limits on OP_RETURN, a transaction commonly used to embed non-financial data into the blockchain. Right now, Bitcoin Core only allows a small amount of data in OP_RETURN. The update would let Core relay much larger transactions by default. The idea has received both support and criticism on GitHub, with the debate centered on whether Bitcoin nodes should block non-monetary transactions or act as neutral relayers of any valid transaction. Those against it argue that removing the limit could invite spam and non-monetary data into Bitcoin blocks, which could occupy space intended for financial transactions. According to them, keeping the current limits protects Bitcoin’s economic value and keeps it efficient. They also say that removing settings like -datacarriersize would reduce node control. Comments from Seccour, chrisguida, and wizkid057 express concern that the change gives in to spammers and encourages misuse of Bitcoin. They all agree that the network should resist spam instead of making it easier. Supporters of the update believe that storing arbitrary data on Bitcoin is already happening and cannot be stopped. They say trying to block it leads to users resorting to worse methods, such as making private deals with miners. The group argues that OP_RETURN is the least harmful method. This is because it is small, cannot be spent, and does not add to the UTXO set. They say increasing the limit can guide data use to this cleaner method and avoid worse alternatives. Comments from murchandamus and eragmus support the decision, with one arguing that it would reduce node traffic and help prevent miner centralization. The other explained that it is a practical change that matches how the network is already used. A Push for Greater Decentralization Bitcoin Core has limited OP_RETURN to 80 bytes since 2014. However, developers announced in May that the cap would be removed in the next version. In a recent statement, they explained that the decision aligns with Core’s goal of reflecting economically relevant activity by ensuring that transactions likely to be mined are relayed. They added that blocking these transactions weakens decentralization, drives users to alternative channels, and ultimately fails to keep the data off the blockchain. Allowing them, they explained, preserves Bitcoin’s censorship resistance and ensures the network operates efficiently. “This is not endorsing or condoning non-financial data usage, but accepting that as a censorship-resistant system, Bitcoin can and will be used for use cases not everyone agrees on,” the statement read.

2025-06-10T18:06:29,"Charles Hoskinson Unveils Cardinal, Unlocking Bitcoin Liquidity for Cardano DeFi","Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has unveiled Cardinal, a new protocol that he explains will bring Bitcoin-native DeFi to the Cardano network for the first time, according to an X post on June 9. Welcome to the first Bitcoin DeFi protocol developed for Cardano https://t.co/CoYvrYnIfI — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) June 9, 2025 The launch is a step forward for both blockchains, allowing users to tap into Bitcoin’s liquidity while using Cardano’s smart contract capabilities and lower transaction fees. Non-Custodial, Cross-Chain DeFi with Bitcoin at the Core Unveiled this week, Cardinal introduces a trust-minimized model for wrapping BTC without relying on centralized custodians or federations—an issue long debated within the crypto space. “Wrapped BTC today comes with tradeoffs,” said Romain Pellerin, CTO at InputOutputHK. “Custodians. Federations. Risk. Cardinal flips the model.” At the core of Cardinal is a new primitive that allows users to wrap any BTC UTXO, so it can be used in DeFi use cases such as lending, borrowing, and staking. The protocol allows Bitcoin to remain locked under MuSig2 aggregated multisignature schemes, while a wrapped UTXO is minted cross-chain and remains redeemable at any time via a fraud-proofed peg-out system. “No rehypothecation. No compromise,” Pellerin added, emphasizing security and transparency. Built on a combination of Bitcoin HTLCs, Cardano smart contracts, and BitVMX for verifiable off-chain execution, Cardinal is designed to be compatible with any smart Layer 1, not just Cardano. It also introduces the first trust-minimized Ordinal bridge from Bitcoin to Cardano’s mainnet. “Ordinals can now be used in DeFi, serve as collateral, be auctioned across chains, and borrow or lend value without losing provenance,” Pellerin explained. The protocol creates wrapped assets—whether NFTs or tokens—that are natively pegged 1:1, transferable on-chain, and burnable to release BTC or Ordinals. With Cardinal, Cardano is positioning itself as a serious contender in cross-chain DeFi by bringing Bitcoin’s value and security into the programmable environment of smart contracts, all while staying true to Bitcoin’s trustless motto. A Strategic Play in the Multi-Chain DeFi Arena Cardinal’s debut comes amid growing demand for decentralized, trustless alternatives to traditional finance. In the wake of multiple high-profile collapses of custodial platforms, protocols like Cardinal are gaining attention for bringing Bitcoin into DeFi without compromising its core principles. Analysts suggest that this move could strengthen Cardano’s position in the multi-chain DeFi race, especially as Ethereum’s gas fees remain high and Bitcoin lacks programmability. Cardano’s strengths in formal verification and academic development may appeal to developers looking for a more secure foundation for cross-chain applications. Cardano Price Prediction Cardano (ADA) has fallen nearly 16% in the past month as the crypto rally faltered amid rising trade tensions between the United States and China , reports Alejandro Arrieche for CryptoNews. Investor sentiment has also been souring lately as reflected by the Fear and Greed Index , whose value has dropped from a local peak of 76 (Greed) to 55 at the time of writing, meaning that investors have now adopted a more cautious approach in what is a relatively uncertain scenario. Cardano’s price prediction centers around the $0.66 level—an area that has acted as a key accumulation zone and one that ADA quickly reclaimed after its recent bearish breakout.

2025-06-10T18:05:30,"Best Crypto to Buy Now? Why Is The Bitcoin Price Going Up","Bitcoin’s rebound over the last 48 hours has flipped expectations. After sitting near $102000, the token climbed beyond $110000 in a move that few saw coming this quickly. Investors who had braced for a slide toward the $97000 range are now reassessing. While the recovery itself has already captured attention, there is more in play. A string of developments, both regulatory and institutional, has begun surfacing at the same time. These aren’t just headlines, but also point to deeper shifts that may support further growth. If the current momentum holds, this phase may prove more meaningful than a simple short-term bounce, especially with renewed confidence in digital assets growing in multiple directions at once. Why Is Bitcoin Going Up - Crypto Market Structure, Policy Shifts, and Technical Analysis The past few days have delivered a sequence of updates that paint a clearer picture for the blockchain space today. At the policy level, SEC Chair Paul Atkins has made a rare but important statement in favor of crypto autonomy. Speaking at a DeFi roundtable, he backed the idea that users should have full control over their digital assets without being forced into centralized custody. Atkins also called for a tailored exemption that would allow builders to bring DeFi products to market without the friction that has so far slowed innovation. If this framework gets adopted, it could speed up development across the space. Two single stock ETFs based on peer to peer payments Circle Internet Group $CRCL which only just IPO'd last Thursday:ProShares Ultra CRCL ETF (leveraged 2x)Bitwise CRCL Option Income Strategy ETF (covered call)ticker/fees: tbaeffective date: August 20, 2025Circle Internet… pic.twitter.com/y57RvMgKjf — ETF Hearsay by Henry Jim (@ETFhearsay) June 9, 2025 In parallel, filings for two ETFs tied to Circle’s stock have landed on the SEC’s desk. One comes from Bitwise, the other from ProShares. Both are designed to offer investors exposure to Circle’s equity performance, a company that already plays a major role in stablecoin infrastructure. If greenlit, these funds would begin trading in August and may create a path for traditional investors to engage indirectly with stablecoins. Technically, Bitcoin’s structure supports the optimism. After testing the top end of its Bollinger range near $110800 , the price pulled back modestly but continues to hold above the midline. Volume has eased slightly, but the lack of strong selling pressure suggests there may still be room for another upward push. When paired with the policy shift and the institutional interest around stablecoin-backed equities, this setup feels less speculative and more grounded. The conditions that once pointed toward a breakdown are now pointing elsewhere, and for altcoins, this may be the window they have been waiting for. Best Crypto to Buy Now – Cryptos That May Pump 10x Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper is a recently introduced presale that focuses on fixing the well-known efficiency issues of the original network. It does so by introducing a custom-built Layer 2 that uses the Solana Virtual Machine. This allows for fast, low-cost transactions while still being anchored to Bitcoin’s security model. The process is simple but intentional: users send Bitcoin to a specified address, which gets validated via smart contracts, and in return, they receive a token that behaves like Bitcoin on the faster chain. Where Bitcoin Hyper separates itself is not just in design, but in execution. The early stages of the rollout have moved quickly, with strong user uptake and consistent presale traction. Many L2 solutions stumble when it comes to integrating with existing Bitcoin holdings, but this protocol seems to have made that bridge less clunky. With Bitcoin avoiding the correction that many anticipated, and renewed confidence spilling over from regulatory discussions and ETF filings, projects built on Bitcoin’s infrastructure have more room to grow. The project has also been covered by top creators like ClayBro and others. Bitcoin Hyper doesn’t rely on trendiness or slogans. It’s aiming to solve a problem that has been discussed since Bitcoin’s early days. If its system continues to scale without network hiccups, it could find serious traction especially now, when speed and flexibility are no longer optional for protocols that want to stay relevant in an increasingly impatient market. SUBBD SUBBD is focused on creators, but not in the shallow, tokenized way that’s been tried before. This is not another tipping system or content paywall. SUBBD builds a structure around the concept of audience equity, where creators issue their own vault tokens backed by community staking, engagement, and visibility. These tokens are tradable, but what matters more is what they represent, which is ownership in a creator’s trajectory. That idea has existed before, but SUBBD is the first to make it operational with smart contract enforcement, a native marketplace, and token utility layered across multiple tools. Its real value becomes more noticeable during periods when crypto sentiment begins to lean constructive, like now. Bitcoin’s recent climb and a growing interest in decentralized product frameworks have made investors more attentive to utility-driven protocols again. Want exclusive content? You’ve gotta earn it 🔥Introducing Fundraising on $SUBBD , where the crowd comes together to unlock special content drops.The more support, the hotter the reward. Ready to unlock? pic.twitter.com/ofKnYzzrCs — SUBBD (@SUBBDofficial) June 8, 2025 SUBBD fits this mood. Instead of chasing volume with gimmicks, it’s proposing a full shift in how creators monetize influence, moving the financial power away from centralized platforms and toward token-backed ecosystems controlled by communities. With its presale still open and social numbers climbing, the project appears to be gaining ground without overextending itself. The architecture allows room for staking, governance, and resale markets, and the visual dashboard already makes clear how the economics of creators and followers are linked. If market interest continues to lean toward decentralized solutions, SUBBD has the structural ingredients to benefit from that shift without needing a market boom to stay relevant. Solaxy Solaxy focuses on something most projects only claim to support, which is scalability across networks. Built as a Layer 2 bridge for both Solana and Ethereum ecosystems, it enables token movement, staking, and on-chain activity between the two without locking users into a single blockchain. This might sound technical, but the practical impact is simple: less friction, more options. And in crypto, that often makes the difference between a tool being used or ignored. Its own token, SOLX, plays a double role. First, it fuels staking rewards for users who provide liquidity across supported chains. Second, it underpins validator infrastructure tied to Solana’s internal growth. This second piece is worth noting, especially now. With policy shifts showing signs of softening, and interest growing around stablecoins and chain infrastructure, projects with cross-chain liquidity mechanics are better positioned to gain user attention and capital flow. Solaxy is expanding faster than the universe! 🛸46M Raised! 🔥 pic.twitter.com/RM3lsZeMha — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) June 9, 2025 Solaxy has also benefited from not being overexposed. It hasn’t promised absurd returns or flooded social media with hype. Instead, it’s been quietly building, maintaining validator integrations, and expanding bridge support. That approach fits well with the current environment, where noise is fading and real use cases are gaining visibility again. The market may still be cautious, but when Bitcoin holds strength and policy commentary favors innovation, frameworks like Solaxy become more than just technical achievements. They start to look like necessities. And that’s when growth stops being speculative and starts being organic. Snorter For what it’s actually trying to do, simply calling Snorter a trading bot wouldn’t be fair. The project essentially acts as a market utility layer that connects user intent with real-time execution across volatile tokens, especially memecoins. It uses adaptive tracking mechanisms, sentiment feeds, and social trend data to identify potential breakout movements before they become obvious. The interface simplifies all this into one-click decision funnels for users who want exposure but not noise. What’s interesting is that Snorter isn’t just meant for day traders or high-frequency players. Even passive users can set predefined triggers, letting the system allocate and adjust micro-positions as markets shift. This kind of automation has existed before, but not often with the kind of meme-sector integration that Snorter is building toward. Its relevance is clearer now as Bitcoin’s recovery has prompted a fresh wave of activity across smaller-cap coins. Whenever BTC moves with conviction, liquidity tends to spill over, and this is the zone where Snorter thrives. The protocol doesn't rely on Bitcoin, but it gains operational advantage when overall volume rises. Unlike many automation platforms that quietly run scripts in the background, Snorter brings visual feedback and in-depth breakdowns to the front. With market participation rising and self-custody becoming a renewed priority at the regulatory level, tools like this that emphasize transparency, speed, and strategic access may not just stay useful. They could become part of the new normal. BTC Bull BTC Bull doesn’t need to chase attention. The token openly reflects a thesis that has existed since the early days of crypto: community is Bitcoin’s strongest multiplier. Instead of trying to extend Bitcoin’s technology, BTC Bull builds around its idea, using design, token incentives, and shared ownership to create a loyalty loop that ties users to Bitcoin’s rise in a more interactive way. There are no layers or chains being added here. The draw lies in the way participation is rewarded. Every element, from visuals to staking logic, is shaped to mirror and support Bitcoin’s movements while still offering separate upside to holders of the token. That creates a unique layer of connection that isn't forced or symbolic. It's built into the structure. With Bitcoin regaining strength and proving more stable than many expected, BTC Bull is gaining visibility as a community-forward option that benefits when confidence returns. Its early stages are still unfolding, and that works to its advantage. There’s no baggage from previous cycles. No overpromises to walk back. It exists now, during a moment where regulatory signals are softening and investor interest is widening again. BTC Bull doesn’t pretend to be infrastructure. It’s culture. But within that simplicity, there’s a clear use case offering a stake in Bitcoin enthusiasm without needing to directly hold or move BTC itself. That’s not a replacement. It’s a companion. And for many in the current market, that’s exactly the kind of exposure they’re looking for. Conclusion The past few days have shifted the outlook. Bitcoin held above key levels, avoided the expected drop, and showed signs of stability that weren’t present earlier. At the same time, policy comments and structural developments have pointed toward fewer restrictions and more room for innovation. When technicals and external signals begin to align, it often marks the start of a new phase. Whether this turns into a broader trend depends on follow-through, but the conditions no longer suggest a market under pressure. They now suggest one preparing for its next move, making the options mentioned above some of the best worth considering.

2025-06-10T18:05:03,"BlackRock Bitcoin Fund Flies Past $70,000,000,000 Faster Than Any Other ETF in History: Bloomberg Analyst","BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust exchange-traded fund has passed the $70 billion mark faster than any other ETF in history by a long shot, according to analysts. Bloomberg ETF specialist Eric Balchunas says in a post on the social media platform X that IBIT has surpassed the $70 billion mark five times faster than the gold-based GLD product. “IBIT just blew through $70b and is now the fastest ETF to ever hit that mark in only 341 days, which is 5x faster than the old record held by GLD of 1,691 days… When BlackRock filed for IBIT, the price was $30k and the stench of FTX was still in air. It’s now $110k (a return that is 7x that of the mighty S&P 500) and is now seen as legitimate for other big investors.” Source: Eric Balchunas/X According to data from blockchain analytics platform Arkham , BlackRock currently holds $76.19 billion worth of digital assets in its crypto wallets. In his annual letter to investors, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that US dollar supremacy can’t last forever and is already being weakened, not only due to skyrocketing debt but also the rise of digital assets and decentralized finance (DeFi). Says Fink, “The US has benefited from the dollar serving as the world’s reserve currency for decades. But that’s not guaranteed to last forever. The national debt has grown at three times the pace of GDP since Times Square’s debt clock started ticking in 1989.57 This year, interest payments will surpass $952 billion— exceeding defense spending. By 2030, mandatory government spending and debt service will consume all federal revenue, creating a permanent deficit. If the US doesn’t get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin. To be clear, I’m obviously not anti-digital assets (far from it; see the next section). But two things can be true at the same time: Decentralized finance is an extraordinary innovation. It makes markets faster, cheaper, and more transparent.

2025-06-10T17:55:48,"Bitcoin's Rally Paves the Way for Altcoins: 3 Projects Ready to Explode After the Latest BTC Surge","As Bitcoin’s latest surge sends ripples through the crypto world , a wave of excitement builds around other digital currencies. Eyes are now on three specific projects poised for significant growth. Discover which altcoins are primed to explode following Bitcoin's impressive rally, offering potential high rewards for keen investors. Aave Price Movements Reinforce Key Entry and Exit Zones Aave has seen dynamic price swings over the past month and six months. The coin rose about 26.62% in the last month, showing a burst of short-term strength and increased buying interest. In contrast, performance over the past six months slipped approximately 4.32%, highlighting a mixed longer-term picture. A weekly gain of roughly 12.01% adds to the recent optimism, even though the extended view reveals persistent challenges. Price volatility remains evident as the market digests these varied trends. Currently, Aave trades between $179.40 and $298.70, with a key resistance level near $350.42 that traders watch with keen interest. Bulls are entering aggressively at times, driving the price upward, yet bears still step in during pullbacks, resulting in an unclear overall trend direction. While the short-term rally hints at bullish energy, the technical setup remains cautious. A support level at approximately $111.81 offers a potential floor, encouraging entries close to this zone if a bounce is detected. A breakout above $350.42 could trigger aggressive buying, though traders should be mindful of the second resistance at $469.73. Uniswap Market Snapshot: Recent Volatility and Key Price Levels Price action over the past month and half-year shows notable swings. Uniswap advanced by 9.60% in one week, yet declined by 6.39% over the month and dropped sharply by 58.74% over the half-year period. Fluctuations reached heights in a narrow range, hinting at recovery attempts after deep corrections. Movements spanned from resilient surges to broad downtrends, revealing periods of optimism followed by significant pullbacks. These variations point to a market that, while capable of sharp upward bursts, remains vulnerable to extended declines during broader market weaknesses. Currently, Uniswap trades within a range between $4.62 and $7.58, with a key support level at $3.20 and nearby resistance at $9.12. Second support at $0.239 and an additional resistance near $12.08 further outline trading boundaries. Indicators suggest mixed signals with upward pressure present, yet caution is warranted due to earlier declines. Bulls are attempting to assert dominance, but the lack of a clear trend encourages careful trading. Traders should consider positioning near support while planning exits at resistance if the price breaks above this area. Bittensor Price Trends and Key Levels for Trading Opportunities Bittensor experienced mixed behavior in recent trading sessions. In the last month, prices declined by about 7.7% after a brief rise of 6.19%. Over the past six months, the coin’s value dropped significantly by almost 28.65%, showing prolonged downward pressure. The recent weekly bounce did little to offset the negative trend, emphasizing the coin’s vulnerability to volatility. These statistics highlight a short-term strength amid ongoing weakness. Current trading levels for Bittensor show a price range between $346 and $507, with immediate resistance at $583.90 and support at $262.30. A second resistance is at $744.70, while a lower support lies at $101.50. Technical indicators suggest that bulls and bears are balanced, as the price moves within a narrow channel. Traders might consider buying near support levels while remaining cautious until a clear trend emerges. Conclusion The recent surge in Bitcoin has set the stage for other cryptocurrencies to shine. AAVE , UNI , and TAO are among the projects poised to benefit. These coins have strong fundamentals and promising potential. This momentum can translate to significant growth for these assets, making them worth watching in the coming months. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-06-10T17:45:11,"$5 ADA Target Envisioned for Cardano as Whales Scoop Up Over 120 Million ADA in a Day","Cardano (ADA) traded mildly weaker on Tuesday despite a strong showing earlier in the week. The broader crypto market experienced a pullback led by Bitcoin’s dip to around $108,923 at press time. However, ADA’s resilience over the past few days, with four consecutive bullish daily candles since Friday, has analysts eyeing a potential breakout that could rival its all-time highs. Popular crypto analyst Javon Marks has reignited bullish sentiment, tweeting that Cardano could surge as much as 666% from current levels. “Using ADA (Cardano)’s previous bull cycle as a guide for this one,” Marks wrote, “ prices could be setting up for another move to and above its 1.272 Fibonacci Level, which is currently at the ~$5.35 price point.” Notably, this mirrors a similar prediction he made in March, reinforcing his long-term outlook based on Fibonacci extension models. If his forecast holds, it would mark one of the most substantial rallies among major altcoins. Marks isn’t the only analyst turning bullish on ADA. Master Ananda also pointed to a consistent pattern of higher lows since June 2023. According to him, recent support zones formed between February and April 2025 suggest a breakout could soon take shape. “Cardano looks great,” Ananda tweeted . “ After four weeks of retrace, we can expect soon higher prices. $2.65 and $4.29 are the main targets.” Adding to the optimism, analyst Trend Rider highlighted a possible “double bottom” formation in ADA’s chart. This is a bullish reversal pattern that, according to academic research, predicts price increases with about 65% accuracy when confirmed by trading volume. That said, the growing bullish sentiment is also being supported by on-chain data. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed Tuesday that whales have accumulated over 120 million ADA tokens in the past 48 hours, based on data from Santiment. Whale activity of this magnitude often precedes price rallies, as it signals rising confidence from influential market players. Beyond price charts and market speculation, Cardano’s fundamental developments are strengthening the case for a long-term rally. On Monday, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson announced the launch of “Cardinal”, the blockchain’s first Bitcoin-backed DeFi protocol. Cardinal allows users to engage in defi using BTC on Cardano without relying on centralized custodians, utilizing advanced cryptographic tools like MuSig2 and wrapped UTXO. The Cardinal protocol enables BTC to be used across DeFi platforms such as MinswapDEX, SundaeSwap, and Fluid Tokens for trading, lending, and collateral, all while preserving full self-custody. Following the announcement, ADA’s trading volume soared nearly 70% to $839 million, with ADA climbing 2.36% in the past 24 hours to trade at $0.7 at press time.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/5-ada-target-envisioned-for-cardano-as-whales-scoop-up-over-120-million-ada-in-a-day/,"ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano",cryptocompare
2025-06-10T17:39:10,"Bitcoin Demand Soars: US Investors Pull BTC From Exchanges Signaling Strong Conviction","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Demand Soars: US Investors Pull BTC From Exchanges Signaling Strong Conviction The cryptocurrency market is always buzzing with activity, but recent data points towards a significant shift specifically within the United States. We’re seeing compelling evidence that U.S. Bitcoin demand is experiencing a notable resurgence, driven by factors that suggest long-term conviction rather than speculative trading. Understanding the Surge in U.S. Bitcoin Demand One of the most closely watched indicators for U.S. buying interest in Bitcoin is the Coinbase Premium. This metric tracks the price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase, a major U.S. exchange, and other global exchanges like Binance. A positive premium suggests stronger buying pressure on Coinbase compared to elsewhere, often signaling demand from U.S.-based investors, both retail and institutional. According to data from on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, the Coinbase Premium has recently reached its highest level since February 3rd, hitting a significant $109.55. This substantial premium indicates that buyers on Coinbase are willing to pay a premium for Bitcoin, a clear sign of robust U.S. demand entering the market. Significant Bitcoin Exchange Withdrawals Point to Long-Term Holding Beyond the premium on U.S. exchanges, another critical data point supporting the narrative of increasing Bitcoin exchange withdrawals. Since July 2024, a staggering 550,000 BTC have been pulled from known exchange wallets. This movement is particularly significant because it often suggests investors are moving their assets into cold storage or private wallets, signaling an intent to hold for the long term rather than keeping funds on exchanges for potential quick selling. Think of it this way: if you plan to sell your Bitcoin soon, you keep it on an exchange for easy access. If you believe the price will rise significantly over time and you intend to hold for months or years, you withdraw it to a more secure, non-custodial wallet. The large volume of these withdrawals points to a collective investor mindset focused on accumulation and holding. What Does the Coinbase Premium Tell Us About BTC Demand? Let’s delve a little deeper into the Coinbase Premium. While $109.55 might seem like a small number relative to Bitcoin’s price, it represents a significant percentage difference that traders and analysts pay close attention to. Historically, periods of sustained positive Coinbase Premium have coincided with strong upward price movements for Bitcoin, as it reflects consistent buying pressure from a major market participant base. The recent spike suggests that despite any recent price corrections or sideways movement, the appetite for acquiring Bitcoin among U.S. investors remains strong. This persistent buying is absorbing available supply, contributing to the upward price pressure observed in the market. Expert Bitcoin Market Analysis on Current Trends On-chain data provides valuable insights, but expert interpretation helps piece the puzzle together. Crypto analyst Crypto Dan weighed in on the trend of exchange withdrawals, suggesting that this behavior reflects a typical pattern seen during a post-correction bullish cycle. In such cycles, savvy investors tend to accumulate during price dips and then move those holdings off exchanges in anticipation of future price appreciation. Another analyst, known as Baykuş, echoed this sentiment, noting that investors are steadily pulling BTC off exchanges. Baykuş interprets this as a clear signal of strong conviction to hold rather than sell. This reinforces the idea that current buyers are not short-term speculators but rather individuals and institutions with a longer time horizon, confident in Bitcoin’s future value. Here’s a quick summary of the key data points and analyst insights: Coinbase Premium: Reached $109.55, highest since Feb 3rd, indicating strong U.S. buying pressure. Exchange Withdrawals: 550,000 BTC withdrawn since July 2024, suggesting movement towards long-term holding. Crypto Dan’s View: Withdrawal behavior is typical of a post-correction bullish accumulation phase. Baykuş’s View: Steady withdrawals signal strong investor conviction to hold rather than sell. Implications of Strong U.S. Conviction What does this mean for the broader Bitcoin market analysis? When long-term holders remove supply from exchanges, it reduces the amount of Bitcoin readily available for sale. With persistent demand, especially from a major market like the U.S., a reduction in available supply can create a supply shock, potentially leading to upward price pressure. The combination of rising Coinbase Premium and significant exchange outflows paints a picture of a market where new demand is being met with reduced selling pressure from those accumulating. This dynamic is often characteristic of periods preceding or during bullish price trends. Challenges and Considerations While the data is compelling, it’s important to remember that the crypto market can be volatile. Macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, and unexpected events can still impact price action. However, the underlying trend of strong U.S. accumulation and withdrawal from exchanges provides a bullish fundamental backdrop that is difficult to ignore. Actionable Insights for Investors For those following the market, these indicators suggest that significant players, particularly in the U.S., are positioning themselves for potential long-term gains. While this analysis is positive, it is crucial to conduct your own research (DYOR) and consider your own risk tolerance before making any investment decisions. Understanding these on-chain metrics can provide valuable context, but they are just one piece of the puzzle. Conclusion: A Bullish Signal from the West The data is clear: U.S. demand for Bitcoin is surging, and investors are backing up that demand with action, moving hundreds of thousands of BTC off exchanges. The elevated Coinbase Premium confirms robust buying interest, while the large-scale withdrawals signal a strong conviction to hold for the future. Coupled with expert analysis pointing towards a post-correction accumulation phase, these trends paint a decidedly bullish picture for Bitcoin from the perspective of U.S. market participation. This confluence of factors suggests that many are anticipating further upside and are securing their positions for the long haul.

2025-06-10T17:32:13,"Analyst Says Ethereum Is ‘Closer to $20K Than Most Anticipate’ Based on This Technical Pattern","Ethereum (ETH) showed renewed strength this week, clim bing strongly alongside Bitcoin since Monday and edging out of a multi-day stretch of low volatility some jokingly called the newest “stablecoin.” But while the recent price movement may seem modest, some analysts believe the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization could be gearing up for a much larger breakout. According to market analyst Gert van Lagen, Ethereum may be significantly undervalued at current levels. In a post on Monday, van Lagen pointed to a clear inverse head and shoulders formation developing on Ethereum’s two-week chart. This bullish technical pattern often signals a major trend reversal. He projects a potential upside target of $19,500, a price level that would mark a new all-time high for ETH and nearly five times its current value. “ ETH [2W] may be closer to $20k than most anticipate,” van Lagen tweeted , emphasizing that a 1.5-year descending broadening wedge, a separate bullish pattern, is also unfolding, reinforcing the potential for a powerful upward breakout. Elsewhere, analyst Master Ananda added weight to the bullish case, noting that Ethereum recently broke above the 200-day moving average, a long-term indicator that traders often view as a signal of sustained bullish momentum. According to Ananda, this is the first time ETH has moved above this line from a low point since November 2024. “This is massive,” he stated on Tradingview, describing it as one of the most reliable bullish indicators in technical analysis. “ Ethereum is now ready to grow for six months straight, minimum.” Ananda forecasted potential price levels of $5,790 and $8,513 in the coming bullish wave, but cautioned that the real upside could extend far beyond those figures. In the background, activity on the Ethereum network is also soaring, which has historically been a precursor for price growth, according to data from blockchain analytics platform GrowThePie. Additionally, institutional confidence in Ethereum appears to be strengthening. According to a research note by analysts at Bernstein on Monday, Ethereum is entering a critical phase of recognition as a foundational layer for financial innovation. The analysts cited rising inflows into Ethereum ETFs, $815 million over the past 20 days and $658 million year-to-date, as evidence of growing investor interest. They noted that while Bitcoin remains a popular store of value, Ethereum is gaining attention for its real-world utility, particularly in areas like stablecoin issuance and tokenized assets. That said, as global payment firms like Visa, Stripe, and Mastercard build stablecoin strategies, Ethereum’s role in powering these systems is becoming harder to ignore. Bernstein analysts argued that Ethereum is no longer just an experimental protocol but a key player in the evolving digital finance landscape. ETH was trading at $2,739 at press time, reflecting an 6.69% surge over the past 24 hours.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/analyst-says-ethereum-is-closer-to-20k-than-most-anticipate-based-on-this-technical-pattern/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Ethereum|News|Ethereum News",cryptocompare
2025-06-10T17:31:42,"Bitcoin: Explosive Breakout Confirms Bullish Uptrend","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: Explosive Breakout Confirms Bullish Uptrend Hey there, fellow crypto enthusiasts! Are you watching the charts? Because Bitcoin price just made a move that’s got everyone talking. After a period of consolidation, BTC has decisively broken out of a significant technical pattern, suggesting that the upward momentum might be far from over. This isn’t just noise; it’s a signal that many analysts believe points towards the continuation of the current bullish trend . Understanding the Bitcoin Bullish Triangle Breakout So, what exactly happened? Bitcoin’s price action recently formed what technical analysts call a ‘bullish triangle’ pattern. This pattern typically occurs during an uptrend when the price consolidates between converging support and resistance lines. The key characteristics include: Converging Lines: A descending resistance line (lower highs) and an ascending support line (higher lows) squeeze the price into a narrower range. Decreasing Volume: Often, volume tends to decrease as the pattern forms, reflecting indecision in the market. The Breakout: A decisive move, usually accompanied by increased volume, breaking above the resistance line. This is the signal that buyers have regained control. The recent price surge saw BTC push above the upper boundary of this triangle, confirming the crypto breakout . This specific type of triangle is generally considered a ‘continuation pattern,’ meaning that once the breakout occurs, the prior trend (in this case, bullish) is likely to continue. What’s Driving This BTC Analysis and Market Sentiment? According to insights shared by crypto financial services firm Matrixport, this breakout isn’t happening in a vacuum. Several factors seem to be aligning: Renewed Capital Inflows: The technical breakout is often a catalyst, attracting fresh capital back into the market as traders and investors see a clear directional signal. Diminishing External Concerns: Matrixport points to easing concerns over potential tariffs and limited expected impact from upcoming U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data. While CPI is crucial for assessing inflation and potential Federal Reserve actions (which heavily influence risk assets like crypto), the market seems to be pricing in a scenario where the next report won’t derail the current positive sentiment significantly. This combination of positive technical signals and favorable market sentiment is powerful. When the technical picture aligns with the fundamental or sentiment-based analysis, it strengthens the conviction behind the move. Why Key Support Levels Matter for the Bullish Trend In any market, identifying and respecting support levels is critical, especially after a breakout. A support level is a price point or zone where buying interest is strong enough to potentially halt a decline. For the current bullish trend in Bitcoin to remain robust, holding above key support is paramount. While specific numbers can change as the market evolves, analysts are closely watching previous resistance levels that could now act as support. A successful breakout often means the former resistance becomes the new floor. If the price were to fall back below the breakout level and significant support zones, it could signal a ‘fakeout’ and potentially invalidate the bullish view. Therefore, monitoring these levels is a key part of any sound BTC analysis right now. Navigating the Crypto Market: Opportunities and Risks A confirmed crypto breakout like this presents potential opportunities for traders and investors looking to participate in the continuation of the uptrend. However, it’s crucial to approach the market with caution and a clear strategy. Potential Opportunities: Trend Following: Entering positions based on the confirmed bullish signal. Target Identification: Using technical analysis (like measuring the height of the triangle) to project potential price targets. Increased Confidence: The clear technical signal can boost confidence for those already in long positions. Potential Risks: Fakeouts: Breakouts can sometimes fail, with the price quickly reversing back into the pattern or below support. Volatility: The crypto market is inherently volatile, and sharp pullbacks can occur even within a strong uptrend. External Factors: Unexpected macroeconomic news or regulatory developments could still impact sentiment. This is why risk management is non-negotiable. Using stop-loss orders and managing position sizes are essential practices. Actionable Insights for Your Bitcoin Strategy Based on the current BTC analysis and the confirmed breakout, here are some actionable takeaways: Monitor Key Support: Keep a close eye on the price levels that previously acted as resistance and are now expected to provide support. A sustained hold above these levels strengthens the bullish case. Watch Volume: Continued healthy volume on upward moves is a positive sign. Declining volume during rallies or increasing volume on declines could be cautionary signals. Stay Informed on Macro News: While the immediate CPI impact might be limited, future economic data and central bank commentary remain important drivers for the broader crypto market . Plan Your Entry/Exit: If you’re considering entering a position based on this breakout, have a clear plan for your entry point, potential targets, and most importantly, your stop-loss level. Be Mindful of Volatility: Don’t over-leverage. The potential rewards in crypto come with significant risk. Looking Ahead: What Could Drive the Bullish Trend Further? Beyond the immediate technical breakout and current sentiment, several factors could contribute to the continuation of the bullish trend for Bitcoin price : Institutional adoption continues to be a significant narrative. The approval and success of Bitcoin ETFs have opened new avenues for traditional investors to gain exposure. Continued inflows into these products could provide sustained buying pressure. Halving events, while already priced in to some extent, reduce the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market, which historically has been a bullish catalyst over the medium to long term. Global economic conditions and the actions of central banks will continue to play a role. A shift towards more accommodative monetary policies, if it occurs, could increase appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. Technically, traders will be looking for the price to clear subsequent resistance levels on its way up. Each successful break of resistance reinforces the strength of the trend. Summary: Is the Path Clear for Higher Bitcoin Prices? The recent crypto breakout from the bullish triangle is a significant technical development for Bitcoin price . It aligns with positive sentiment indicators like renewed capital inflows and diminishing immediate concerns over macroeconomic data like CPI, as highlighted by Matrixport’s BTC analysis . While the market is always subject to unpredictable events and volatility, the technical picture, supported by underlying sentiment, suggests that the bullish trend has a strong chance of continuing. However, staying vigilant, monitoring key support levels, and employing sound risk management strategies are crucial for navigating the dynamic crypto market . This breakout provides a compelling signal, but the journey upward requires careful observation and informed decision-making.

2025-06-10T17:30:35,"Chainlink Cross-Border Play Expands To Hong Kong–Australia Money Movement","Chainlink is set to play a major role as Hong Kong’s central bank takes a big step in its digital currency tests. Phase two of the e-HKD pilot will try moving tokenized Hong Kong dollars across borders. The plan is to swap e-HKD for A$DC, an Australian dollar stablecoin. This could cut settlement times from days to seconds. It may also show how central banks can work together with blockchain technology. Related Reading: Relentless Bitcoin Accumulation: Strategy Snaps Up 1,045 More BTC Hong Kong And Australia Test Digital Cash According to reports, the project will use Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol, or CCIP, to handle transfers. The goal is simple. Move money in real time and make sure both sides get what they expect. Phase two kicks off with Hong Kong authorities and their counterparts in Australia. They will swap e-HKD for A$DC and aim for instant settlement. Based on reports, this setup could serve as a model for other central banks. We’re excited to share that Chainlink is facilitating the secure exchange of a Hong Kong CBDC and an Australian dollar stablecoin as part of an ongoing use case in Phase 2 of the e-HKD+ Pilot Program. Congratulations to participants @Visa, ANZ, China AMC, and Fidelity… pic.twitter.com/ts2C6Vt4Ul — Chainlink (@chainlink) June 9, 2025 Chainlink Tools In Use Chainlink is not just a name in the mix. It brings two big pieces of tech to the table. CCIP handles the cross-chain messages, acting like a bridge between different blockchains. The Digital Transfer Agent, or DTA, deals with compliance. It keeps track of who owns what token and makes sure rules in different countries are met. In May, World Liberty Financial tapped Chainlink for cross-chain stablecoin transfers covering USD1. That earlier deal hinted at what’s possible this time around. Big Names Join The Pilot Visa and ANZ are helping with payment processing for e-HKD and A$DC. Asset managers Fidelity International and ChinaAMC will also take part. Their job is to manage the tokenized funds on both sides. This mix of banks, asset managers and tech firms shows the project is more than a small test. It has real money and real risks involved. Reports disclosed that those risks are managed by a Payment-versus-Payment model. This means funds are only released when both sides confirm they have received the other asset. Related Reading: Elon Musk ‘Will Do Anything’ To Make XRP King, Tech Mogul Says Market Moves And Reactions LINK, the token for Chainlink, jumped by 6% after news of the pilot broke. It now trades at $14.70. That rise follows a wider market rally driven by hopes that Bitcoin may hit $110,000 before the week’s end. According to market data, crypto traders often chase big targets. Short-term gains can be tempting. But they can also lead to quick sell-offs if the main story fades. Despite the rally, Bitcoin still tracks the equity swings rather closely. There is a mix of bulls and bears in futures data that suggests some people are not yet convinced this run will last. High volatility can shake out weaker hands at the first sign of trouble. A sudden change in risk sentiment or a fresh macro shock can quickly reverse gains.

2025-06-10T17:30:21,"Malaysia’s Crypto Mining Boom Threatened By $100 Million Power Theft","Malaysia’s crypto miners are at a crossroads. A new study by the ACCESS Blockchain Association of Malaysia points to big gains ahead. But it also warns that illegal outfits are draining more than RM441 million from the power grid between 2020 and 2024. That $100 million loss has hit both public safety and investor trust. Malaysia Mining Faces Power Theft Crisis According to national utility Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB), hidden rigs in homes and offices have been tapping into the grid without permission. Over the last five years, TNB logged power losses worth RM441 million. That’s more than $100 million in stolen electricity. Now, grid instability is rising. Local communities risk outages. And real miners worry their bills could spike to cover the shortfall. Legal Mining Growth Could Bring RM700 Million Based on reports from ACCESS , formalizing crypto mining could unlock RM700 million in hardware and infrastructure this year alone. It could also create 4,000 new jobs and boost annual tax revenues by around RM150 million. Malaysia already ranks among the top 10 countries worldwide by bitcoin hash rate share. Cheap industrial tariffs in places like East Sarawak help explain the hike. Yet many legal players stay under the radar. They fear unclear rules and sudden policy shifts. Regulators Urged To Act The study points out that no agency specifically licenses mining. The Securities Commission looks after asset trading and custody, but it stops there. Miners have no dedicated permit. They face vague electricity tariffs and murky environmental rules. That confusion deters investors who want stability. ACCESS calls for a clear mining license, fair pricing, and defined environmental checks. In neighboring Thailand and Indonesia, illegal mining has also spiked. Between 2018 and 2024, power-theft incidents tied to crypto rigs jumped nearly 300%, totaling nearly 2,400 cases. That regional trend underlines a shared headache. If Malaysia doesn’t tighten laws, it risks losing credibility in the fast-growing digital asset arena. TNB has started using smart meters and data analytics to spot theft early. But enforcement remains patchy. Multiple government bodies share responsibility, which means cases often slip through the cracks. Without a unified team on this, illegal operators keep hitting the grid—and the public. ACCESS suggests updating landlord liability laws so building owners can’t turn a blind eye to unauthorized rigs. It also recommends energy pricing tied to sustainability, nudging miners toward greener power.

2025-06-10T17:18:09,"Cathie Wood's ARK Invest: Bitcoin Gains Coming Alongside Clear Stress in Housing, Autos","Bitcoin’s BTC rise to new all-time highs is happening on a backdrop of deep economic strain, according to a new report from Cathie Wood-led ARK Invest. Bitcoin's 11.1% climb in May, outpaced gold and broke through key resistance levels, said ARK. Gains also coincided with clear signs of stress in the housing and auto sectors, traditionally seen as pillars of U.S. consumer strength. In housing, the number of sellers has far outpaced buyers, a trend ARK links to the Federal Reserve’s steep rate hikes since 2022. With affordability deteriorating, pressure is mounting on prices in what remains the largest source of household net worth. Meanwhile, auto sales, which surged earlier this year in anticipation of tariffs, collapsed in May — falling to 15.6 million units from above 17 million just a month prior. As these markets soften, bitcoin appears to be catching some of the capital looking for yield and resilience, ARK noted. Spot bitcoin ETFs drew $5.5 billion in May — more than triple the inflows seen in gold ETFs, which dropped sharply during the same period. ARK noted that bitcoin’s current rally doesn’t yet reflect speculative excess. Profit-taking behavior remains measured, with unrealized gains sitting well below the levels that marked prior bubbles. For investors moving away from stressed real-world assets, bitcoin may be serving not as a gamble, but as a calculated reallocation in a shifting economic landscape.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/10/cathie-woods-ark-invest-bitcoin-gains-coming-alongside-clear-stress-in-housing-autos,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|ARK Invest|Bitcoin|News",cryptocompare

2025-06-10T17:15:56,"Siebert Financial to Raise $100M to Fuel Crypto and AI Growth Plan","Siebert Financial Corp., a well-known financial services company, is set to raise a massive $100 million to fund its crypto investments. On Monday, the company revealed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved its S-3 shelf registration. This approval allows the Nasdaq-listed firm to invest the money raised in cryptocurrencies, artificial intelligence (AI), and possible new business acquisitions. This decision comes as many public companies increasingly invest in digital assets and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology. Siebert Financial To Invest in Digital Assets and Technology Siebert clarified that this fundraising effort is part of a bigger plan. The firm wants to expand its technology capabilities and strengthen its position in digital finance. John Gebbia, Siebert’s CEO, called the shelf registration a foundational step for growing the company’s technology strategy. Siebert plans to invest some of the funds in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). These digital assets have become more popular among companies looking to diversify their holdings and tap into the potential of blockchain technology . The company will also explore using AI-powered services to improve its operations and client service. Siebert’s Move Signals Strategy for Long-Term Growth Siebert’s leaders see this capital raise as essential to their long-term growth plan. For context, a shelf registration, like the S-3 type, is designed to allow a company to sell stocks or bonds over time when market conditions are favorable. With approval from the SEC, Siebert can move quickly when new opportunities arise. This will enable the Nasdaq-listed firm to explore fast-growing innovative sectors, including AI and blockchain technology. In addition, the approval also gives Siebert the advantage of not having to raise the full $100 million at once. The firm can offer smaller amounts based on its needs and market trends. Using an S-3 shelf registration, Siebert focuses on growth and innovation as it moves into new areas like crypto and AI. Siebert Follows a Bigger Trend in Corporate Crypto Adoption Siebert’s move is not insolation. Many other companies are increasing their investments in cryptocurrencies. Strategy, led by popular Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, remains the largest public holder of Bitcoin. On the same day as Siebert’s announcement, Strategy disclosed it had bought another 1,045 BTC for about $110.2 million. This brings its total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 582,000 BTC. Other firms are also making moves. Trump Media, GameStop, and research firm K33 have all revealed plans to increase their Bitcoin holdings. Meanwhile, Japan’s Metaplanet recently launched a $5.4 billion equity offering to buy even more Bitcoin.

Price Analysis","Plenty of price fluctuations are sending Bitcoin this way and that, but Ethereum (ETH) appears to be holding its own. With $BTC in the red, along with a good part of the altcoins, $ETH is up on the day and threatening to break through the $2,700 major resistance. Is $ETH about to break much higher, or is another rejection in the offing? ETH/USD at critical juncture Source: TradingView Going straight into the higher time frame for $ETH it can be seen that the number 2 cryptocurrency by market capitalization is at a critical juncture. The price has been in a range during the last few weeks and is right at the top of this currently. If the bulls can tip the price over and into the horizontal resistance band that stretches from $2,750 up to $2,900, the $ETH price could have the chance to consolidate here; perhaps moving sideways for a period until shorter-term time frame Stochastic RSIs can reset. $ETH confirms breakout against $BTC pair Source: TradingView The 4-hour time frame for ETH/BTC reveals that $ETH has just penetrated the descending trendline, has come back to test it, and is now consolidating above. A higher high has been made, although out in the higher time frame of the weekly, the Stochastic RSI indicators have reached the top, meaning that there could be a longer period of consolidation to come. Huge task confronts $ETH bulls against $BTC Source: TradingView Zooming out into that weekly time frame for ETH/BTC the sheer size of the task confronting the $ETH bulls becomes apparent. While $ETH is up 40% against its $BTC pair recently, this is still a drop in the ocean compared to what needs to be done. It can be noted just how strong the current horizontal resistance level is. However, the bulls have to start somewhere and if this level can be overcome, the next resistance is at 0.03 BTC. The $ETH bulls will need all the luck they can get.

2025-06-10T17:05:23,"Ethena price forms Double Bottom as accumulation zone holds firm","Ethena is showing early signs of a bullish reversal as price action begins to mirror previous accumulation phases. A potential double bottom is forming at key support, and a breakout above the $0.50 resistance level could confirm the start of a new upward rotation toward higher time frame Fibonacci targets. The current market structure on Ethena ( ENA ) suggests the asset is trading in an accumulation phase, supported by both technical indicators and fractal similarities to prior price action. Price has returned to a historically significant zone, where a rounded bottom is forming. This area previously acted as the base for a major bullish expansion and may now be setting the stage for a similar move. Key technical points Double Bottom Formation in Progress: Price action is forming a clear double bottom pattern, often a precursor to trend reversals. $0.50 Resistance Is Key: A break above this high-timeframe level could confirm bullish intent and open the path toward higher resistance. Accumulation Range Intact: Ethena continues to trade in a sideways structure between key support and resistance levels. ENAUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingVIew From a technical and structural standpoint, Ethena is working through a prolonged consolidation period. Price is trading within a clearly defined accumulation range, positioned between strong support and resistance zones. The current setup mirrors a previous bottoming pattern where price coiled before a decisive breakout. A double bottom pattern is developing, characterized by two rounded lows and a neckline around the $0.50 region. This level represents the final barrier before confirming the reversal structure. If price breaks above $0.50 with strong volume and follow-through, it would validate the bullish thesis and could drive a move toward the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement from the broader downtrend. You might also like: Pi Network price prediction: technicals hint at possible 160% breakout For now, the market remains in a wait-and-see phase. The absence of a confirmed breakout means range-bound trading is likely to continue until bulls gain enough momentum to challenge resistance. Despite the consolidation, the structure remains constructive, with no signs of breakdown and multiple technical signals pointing to continued accumulation. What to expect in the coming price action If Ethena breaks and holds above the $0.50 resistance level, it would confirm the double bottom and likely spark a rally toward the next major target near the 0.618 Fibonacci level. Until then, continued accumulation and sideways movement are expected as the market builds toward its next significant move.

2025-06-10T17:03:58,"Here’s XRP Price if Its Market Cap Hit 8% of the US M2 Money Supply","XRP price could surge to incredibly higher levels if the crypto asset's market cap reaches just 8% of the expanding U.S. M2 money supply. XRP has recently shown signs of strength, climbing back to $2.24 after briefly dipping to retest the $2 level last week. Although the price bounced, it still hasn't broken past the $3 mark, a level it has struggled with since February. Meanwhile, despite five straight months of bearish pressure, XRP has managed to stay above $2, and analysts see this as a sign of resilience. Many believe the $2 zone could serve as a base for a bigger move when market conditions improve.US M2 Money Supply Grows: How Could This Impact XRP?This optimism comes as the broader economy sees a growing money supply. The U.S. M2 money supply, which includes cash, checking and savings deposits, time deposits under $100,000, and retail money market funds, has been rising steadily since December 2023. Specifically, current data indicates that the M2 money supply now sits at $21.86 trillion, up 5.3% from December 2023, an increase of over $1 trillion. US M2 Money Supply US M2 Money Supply Notably, a rising M2 usually indicates more liquidity in the system, which can drive demand for riskier assets like crypto assets. Essentially, when cash is easier to access and interest rates stay low, investors often move some of that capital into markets like crypto, hoping for better returns. This extra cash flow can push asset prices higher. However, the trend does not always play out in a straight line. For one, if inflation creeps up too quickly, the Federal Reserve may respond by raising rates or tightening policy. This change can reverse the momentum and weigh on crypto markets. So, while more money in circulation can boost assets like XRP, it actually depends on how investors and policymakers react.XRP Price if Its Market Reached 8% of M2 Money Supply Now, with M2 growing, some in the XRP community have begun projecting what would happen if XRP captured just a fraction of that money. Amid the speculation, we recently assessed what XRP price might be if its market cap reached 8% of the U.S. M2 money supply. Notably, this 8% portion translates to about $1.748 trillion, considering the current M2 money supply. Such a valuation is much larger than Ethereum's current market cap of around $301 billion, though still behind Bitcoin's $2.1 trillion valuation.For XRP to hit a $1.748 trillion market cap, its price would need to jump significantly. Specifically, with 58.82 billion tokens in circulation, XRP price would need to trade at around $29.73, bringing it close to the $30 figure. Interestingly, several analysts have suggested that XRP could reach $30. For one, market commentator Crypto Bulls suggested last month that XRP is programmed to claim at least $30 this cycle. Meanwhile, in March, analyst Steph insisted that XRP had already reached its bottom price for the cycle, suggesting a recovery could lead to an upsurge toward $30.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/10/heres-xrp-price-if-its-market-cap-hit-8-of-the-us-m2-money-supply/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heres-xrp-price-if-its-market-cap-hit-8-of-the-us-m2-money-supply,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction",cryptocompare

Shiba Inu joined a broader market bullish trend yesterday, continuing its recovery phase. Notably, the second-largest meme coin by market capitalization is up 3% since the start of the week and is on track for its first positive price action in five weeks.Shiba Inu to $150 Billion Market Cap?Meanwhile, data from IntoTheBlock shows a moderate correlation between Shiba Inu and the broader crypto market. For context, with SHIB, Bitcoin has a correlation coefficient of 0.61, Ethereum has 0.57, and Dogecoin has a higher 0.86 over the past sixty days. Shiba Inu Price Correlation with the Crypto Market Shiba Inu Price Correlation with the Crypto Market | IntoTheBlock This suggests that Shiba Inu would mirror a broader bullish market trend. Hence, with institutional interest entering the cryptocurrency market, analysts predict that major cryptocurrencies will rally extensively, which could potentially push Shiba Inu to a $150 billion market cap.Also, the development of the Shiba Inu ecosystem further fuels this optimism. Recent technological deployments and a strategic partnership with the United Arab Emirates' Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure (MoEI) have raised confidence that Shiba Inu will defy current bearish trends and potentially reach a market cap of $150 billion.Shiba Inu’s Price at $150 Billion Market CapAccording to the current rankings, it is the 19th-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, with a valuation of $7.65 billion. Notably, if this figure rallies to $150 billion, it will surpass the $45 billion peak valuation in October 2021.Currently, Shiba Inu has a total supply of 589.5 trillion SHIB. As a result, a $150 billion cap would push prices to $0.000254, representing a staggering 1,856% upsurge from the current prices. It would also see the meme coin surpass its current all-time high of $0.00008845.Is a Rally to $0.000254 Possible?Considering Shiba Inu’s current trajectory, a 1,856% surge to $0.000254 seems ambitious. Achieving the price mark would ensure it chalks off one more zero, pushing prices on course for new heights, such as $0.01.Notwithstanding, analysis suggests this is possible. Market watcher More Crypto Online highlighted in an earlier commentary that Shiba Inu could rally to between $0.0001 and $0.0002, citing a bullish Elliot Wave formation.Moreover, Changelly also projected the price mark for Shiba Inu, specifically suggesting it would happen by May 2032.
