2025-06-10T10:50:51,"KULR Technology Group Plans Bold Move: Raising $300M to Buy Bitcoin","BitcoinWorld KULR Technology Group Plans Bold Move: Raising $300M to Buy Bitcoin In a move signaling growing interest from traditional finance in the digital asset space, KULR Technology Group (KULR), a company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, has announced plans to raise a significant amount of capital that could be used to buy Bitcoin . According to a report by CoinDesk, KULR is embarking on a common stock offering aimed at raising up to $300 million. While the funds are earmarked for general corporate purposes, including working capital, a notable allocation mentioned is the potential acquisition of Bitcoin. This announcement places KULR in the spotlight, adding its name to the list of publicly traded companies considering or actively pursuing institutional Bitcoin adoption . Why Would a Company Like KULR Want to Buy Bitcoin? The decision for a technology company like KULR to potentially invest in Bitcoin reflects a broader trend we’ve observed over the past few years. Companies are increasingly exploring Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, a hedge against inflation, or simply as an alternative investment with potential for significant upside. For KULR, which specializes in thermal management and battery safety, this move isn’t directly related to their core business but rather a strategic financial decision. Several factors might influence such a decision: Inflation Hedge: With ongoing concerns about inflation, companies look for assets that can potentially preserve or increase value over time, unlike traditional fiat currencies. Bitcoin’s limited supply is often cited as a key characteristic in this regard. Store of Value: Proponents view Bitcoin as ‘digital gold,’ a decentralized store of value that is not subject to the monetary policies of any single government or central bank. Potential Appreciation: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has shown significant long-term growth potential, attracting companies seeking higher returns than traditional low-yield investments. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin to the corporate balance sheet can offer diversification benefits, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. This potential move by KULR highlights the evolving perception of Bitcoin from a niche technology experiment to a viable, albeit volatile, asset class for corporate treasuries. It’s a significant development for holders of KULR stock and for the crypto market alike. Navigating the Challenges of Corporate Crypto Investment While the potential benefits of holding Bitcoin are attractive, companies venturing into crypto investment face unique challenges. These include: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is notoriously volatile, which can lead to significant fluctuations in the value of a company’s treasury holdings and impact its financial statements. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still developing globally, posing potential risks related to compliance, taxation, and future restrictions. Accounting Treatment: Accounting rules for cryptocurrencies can be complex, often requiring companies to record impairment losses when the price drops, even if they haven’t sold the asset. Security Risks: Safely storing large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security measures to prevent theft or loss of private keys. Shareholder Reaction: Investors in traditional markets may have varying views on a company allocating significant capital to a volatile and relatively new asset class like Bitcoin. Companies like KULR must carefully weigh these risks against the potential rewards and develop a clear strategy for managing their Bitcoin holdings, including custody solutions and accounting practices. KULR Joins the Ranks? Comparing Corporate Bitcoin Strategies KULR’s potential move follows in the footsteps of other notable companies that have allocated significant portions of their treasury reserves to Bitcoin. The most prominent example is MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, which has aggressively accumulated Bitcoin over the past few years, making it a core part of their corporate strategy. Tesla also made headlines when it announced a large Bitcoin purchase in 2021, although its holdings have fluctuated since then. While KULR’s potential $300 million allocation is substantial for the company, it’s worth noting the scale relative to giants like MicroStrategy, which holds billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin. However, any new publicly traded company entering the space contributes to the narrative of increasing institutional Bitcoin adoption and can influence market sentiment. This move by KULR, if finalized with a Bitcoin purchase, serves as another data point indicating that corporate interest in digital assets is not waning and could potentially encourage other firms to explore similar strategies. What Does This Mean for KULR Stock and the Market? For investors in KULR stock , this news introduces a new dimension to the company’s financial strategy. The success or failure of their potential Bitcoin investment could impact shareholder value, separate from the performance of their core technology business. It could attract a new type of investor interested in exposure to Bitcoin through a traditional stock, but it could also deter those who are risk-averse or skeptical of cryptocurrencies. For the broader crypto market, every instance of a publicly traded company deciding to buy Bitcoin is generally seen as a positive signal. It lends legitimacy to the asset class and demonstrates growing institutional confidence. A $300 million purchase, while not the largest seen, is still a significant capital inflow that could potentially impact market dynamics, especially if executed over time. Actionable Insights for Investors For individuals watching this development, here are a few insights: Monitor KULR’s Execution: Keep an eye on official announcements from KULR regarding how and when they might allocate funds to Bitcoin. Understand the Risks: Recognize that corporate Bitcoin holdings add volatility to a company’s financial profile. Research the potential impacts on KULR stock . Broader Trend: See this as part of the larger trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption . This trend is a key factor influencing the long-term outlook for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Diversify Your Own Portfolio: If you are interested in crypto investment , consider your own risk tolerance and diversification strategy rather than solely relying on corporate decisions as investment signals. Conclusion: Another Step Towards Mainstream Adoption KULR Technology Group’s plan to potentially raise $300 million, with a portion possibly allocated to buy Bitcoin , is a notable development in the ongoing story of institutional adoption. While not without risks, the decision reflects a growing corporate willingness to explore digital assets as part of a modern treasury strategy. This move could have implications for both KULR’s future performance and the broader perception and valuation of Bitcoin in the traditional financial world. It underscores the increasing convergence of traditional markets and the crypto space, marking another step towards Bitcoin becoming a more mainstream asset.

2025-06-10T10:50:06,"Paraguay President’s Hacked X Account Falsely Claims Bitcoin Is Legal Tender","Paraguayan President Santiago Peña deleted a post on his X account after a likely hack by crypto scammers who claimed the South American nation would recognize Bitcoin as legal tender. No, Paraguay Didn’t Actually Make Bitcoin Legal Tender In a Monday post on X, the president’s official account falsely announced (in English) that Paraguay had made Bitcoin legal tender and established a BTC reserve worth $5 million. It also provided a Bitcoin wallet address for investors to “secure [their] stake” in the project. Peña’s previous posts were all written in Spanish, hence, the latest post raised immediate doubts of a potential hack. Less than an hour later, the official page of the Presidency of Paraguay posted on X: “The president’s official account on social media network X has irregular activity which suggests possible unauthorized use.” Comunicado oficial. pic.twitter.com/Bk3XI6ohpp — Presidencia Paraguay (@PresidenciaPy) June 9, 2025 Paraguay is home to massive Bitcoin mining operations, largely belonging to HIVE (HIVE). However, El Salvador is the only country in the region to have adopted Bitcoin as legal tender . The President Nayib Bukele-led government also frequently buys the top cryptocurrency for its reserve, despite the International Monetary Fund urging it to revoke its Bitcoin law. Crypto Scammers Target High-Profile X Accounts Even before eccentric tech billionaire Elon Musk acquired X (formerly known as Twitter) in 2022, hackers took over accounts belonging to celebrities or politicians. Back in 2020, hackers hijacked Twitter accounts run by former U.S. President Barack Obama, ex-President Joe Biden, Apple, Uber, Kanye West, Elon Musk, and Bill Gates as part of a Bitcoin-related scam. And in 2021, cybercriminals compromised Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s X account to falsely announce the country had made BTC legal tender. More recently, a hacker in the US was able to breach the Securities and Exchange Commission’s X account through a SIM swap attack, falsely announcing the Wall Street regulator had greenlighted the introduction of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on American exchanges. The culprit, Eric Council Jr., was arrested by the FBI and later hit with a 14-month prison sentence for his role in the scheme.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/paraguay-presidents-hacked-x-account-falsely-claims-bitcoin-is-legal-tender/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Paraguay",cryptocompare

Price prediction suggests potential to reach $2.05 by year-end 2025. Long-term forecasts indicate ADA could hit $10.25 by 2030. The Plomin Hard Fork, which activated in Q1 2025, has significantly enhanced Cardano’s appeal to investors by establishing full decentralized governance. This is seen as a key milestone that aligns with the blockchain’s long-term vision of community-driven decision-making. Despite these advancements, bullish attraction post-Plomin Hard Fork was tempered by market dynamics and challenges, on its price chart. However, in Q2 2025, things seem to have changed , as a variety of optimistic factors surround the altcoin sector, which is benefiting the ADA price. As a result, Cardano price prediction is heating up again in the community. With bullish technical signals, major upgrades, and ETF hopes rising , many are intrigued to know, “Is ADA Price ready for a massive breakout?” Here’s a detailed ADA price prediction for 2025 and beyond, including expert targets up to 2050. Coinpedia’s Cardano Price Prediction 2025 Assuming that Cardano continues to focus on the network’s upcoming updates, we can expect a wider adoption rate. Even the ETF odds has higher approval rate that could bring large crowd wil multi-billion dollars into the asset, once approved. Therefore, we expect the ADA price to reach $2.05 in 2025.

A short-term bearish crossover between the 20-day and 50-day EMA bands formed in early June, signaling weakening bullish conviction. Currently, ADA is consolidating within a symmetrical triangle inside the larger wedge pattern. However, short-term bullish momentum returned after June 6, allowing ADA to re-enter the pattern. The move was fueled by renewed optimism in the altcoin market, particularly following its inclusion in the NASDAQ-listed Hashdex ETF with a 1.2% allocation . To confirm a bullish breakout, ADA must close above $0.74 , which could open the path to retest $1.10 —a major resistance level since mid-December 2024.If momentum weakens and selling resumes, ADA could fall toward $0.55 or even $0.40 , key lower support zones. Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) June 2025 $0.40 $0.74 $1.10 ADA Price Prediction 2025 Source: coincarp Cardano has always prioritized decentralization, and the recent Plomin hard fork has taken it a step further. Unlike many other blockchains, Cardano gives more control to its users than to any central organization. This is reflected in CoinCarp’s rich list, where the top 100 addresses hold just 22% of the mainnet’s circulating supply, significantly lower than most other altcoins. To push ADA’s price beyond the $1.10 to $1.20 range, strong retail participation will be necessary. A potential catalyst for this could be the approval of an ADA ETF , which experts believe could launch by the end of this year and attract billions in inflows.If ADA manages to sustain levels above its Q1 2025 high , there’s a solid chance it could retest the $2.05 mark by year-end.

2025-06-10T10:42:06,"Cardano unveils Cardinal to connect Bitcoin users to $334M DeFi ecosystem","Cardano has launched Cardinal, a new protocol aimed at connecting Bitcoin to the Cardano decentralised finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The announcement, made by Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson on 9 June during the Bitcoin 2025 conference, marks a strategic shift to draw liquidity from Bitcoin’s vast network into Cardano’s smart contract infrastructure. Charles Hoskinson @IOHK_Charles · Follow Welcome to the first Bitcoin DeFi protocol developed for Cardano 10:48 PM · Jun 9, 2025 2.0K Reply Copy link Read 64 replies Cardinal enables users to lend, borrow, and stake Bitcoin without leaving the native Bitcoin chain or using traditional custodians. The launch comes as Cardano’s DeFi total value locked (TVL) has dropped from $415 million in May to $334 million as of 10 June, according to DefiLlama . Bitcoin DeFi integration without bridges or custodians Cardinal is designed to bring Bitcoin into the DeFi space by wrapping unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) and converting them into tokens that are pegged 1:1 with Bitcoin. This lets Bitcoin holders use their assets on Cardano’s platform without relying on centralised bridges or custodians. The process is trust-minimised, allowing users to reclaim their Bitcoin at any time through a secure and verifiable method. Unlike traditional wrapped BTC protocols that often depend on a central authority, Cardinal operates using MuSig2, a multi-signature cryptographic scheme. This technique enables multiple participants to cooperatively sign transactions, while maintaining Bitcoin’s security guarantees. As long as at least one party in the network behaves honestly, the system remains secure, and the wrapped Bitcoin stays locked on the native chain. No rehypothecation, more asset control for users One of Cardinal’s main differentiators is its stance on rehypothecation. In many financial systems, custodians re-use deposited assets—often without full user awareness. Cardinal eliminates this risk by preventing intermediaries from controlling user assets, giving holders complete visibility and ownership throughout the DeFi process. Cardinal’s smart contract framework avoids unnecessary centralisation by leveraging BitVMX—an off-chain computation protocol. BitVMX allows users to perform complex operations involving Bitcoin, without needing to compromise on decentralisation. When paired with Cardano’s Plutus smart contracts, this configuration allows seamless asset movement between the two blockchains. Live BTC-Cardano transfer demo showcases use case At the Bitcoin 2025 event, Input Output (IO), the research and development firm behind Cardano, demonstrated a bridgeless BTC-to-Cardano asset transfer using Cardinal and BitVMX. The live demonstration served as a proof-of-concept, underscoring Cardinal’s capacity to bring Bitcoin-native liquidity to Cardano’s DeFi platforms. This move comes at a time when Cardano is aiming to boost its TVL and regain DeFi traction. According to DefiLlama, Cardano’s DeFi market has seen a decline in locked value since its May peak. By offering Bitcoin users direct DeFi access without leaving their native network, Cardinal could provide the liquidity injection needed to revive activity on the Cardano chain. Market impact and future roadmap Cardano’s DeFi infrastructure has historically struggled to match Ethereum’s or Solana’s dominance. However, Cardinal represents a new model for integrating Bitcoin in a non-custodial, decentralised way. The protocol not only enables secure lending and borrowing with wrapped Bitcoin, but also introduces interoperability across ecosystems—one of the key bottlenecks for DeFi expansion. Input Output has not yet announced a full-scale rollout date but plans to continue testing Cardinal under real-world conditions. The team will likely focus on increasing Cardinal’s adoption among Bitcoin users looking for DeFi exposure without compromising on custody or decentralisation. The move also reflects a broader trend in the DeFi space, where newer protocols are prioritising asset sovereignty, cryptographic security, and interoperability. If successful, Cardinal could set a precedent for how major blockchain ecosystems integrate Bitcoin, and how Bitcoin evolves from a passive store of value to an active player in decentralised finance.

2025-06-10T10:40:56,"BlackRock IBIT: The Astonishing Rise of the Fastest Growing ETF Ever","BitcoinWorld BlackRock IBIT: The Astonishing Rise of the Fastest Growing ETF Ever Get ready for some mind-blowing news from the world of finance and crypto! BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF , known by its ticker symbol IBIT, has just achieved something truly extraordinary. In less than a year since its launch, this investment vehicle has reached an astounding milestone, signaling a massive shift in how traditional finance views and accesses the cryptocurrency market. This isn’t just another fund; it’s setting records at an unprecedented pace. BlackRock IBIT Reaches Unprecedented Heights The headline speaks volumes: BlackRock IBIT has officially crossed the $70 billion mark in assets under management (AUM). What makes this figure particularly impactful isn’t just the number itself, but the speed at which it was accumulated. According to Bloomberg ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas, who shared the data on X (formerly Twitter), IBIT hit this impressive AUM total in a mere 341 days from its inception. Balchunas didn’t stop there. He highlighted the significance of this achievement, stating that it makes IBIT the Fastest Growing ETF ever recorded within that specific timeframe. Think about that for a moment – out of thousands of ETFs launched over the years, none have gathered assets this quickly in their first year. How Does IBIT’s Growth Compare? To truly appreciate the scale of IBIT’s rapid ascent, it helps to put it into perspective. One of the most common comparisons for a Spot Bitcoin ETF is against established commodity ETFs, particularly those tracking gold. The SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) is the world’s largest spot gold ETF and a benchmark for asset gathering in the commodity space. Here’s where IBIT’s performance becomes even more striking: IBIT reached its current size five times faster than GLD did during its initial growth phase. GLD, launched in 2004, took years to accumulate the level of assets IBIT has gathered in under 11 months. This comparison underscores the unique market dynamics at play and the pent-up demand for accessible Crypto Investment opportunities within traditional investment frameworks. Why is BlackRock IBIT Growing So Fast? Several factors are likely contributing to the phenomenal success of the BlackRock IBIT fund: BlackRock’s Reputation: As the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock brings immense trust, credibility, and distribution power. Investors comfortable with BlackRock’s traditional offerings are more likely to invest in their crypto product. Accessibility: A Spot Bitcoin ETF provides a straightforward way for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without the complexities of buying, storing, or securing the actual cryptocurrency. It can be bought and sold like any stock through standard brokerage accounts. Market Timing: The launch coincided with renewed positive sentiment around Bitcoin, partly fueled by the anticipation and approval of these very ETFs. Institutional Interest: While retail investors are certainly participating, a significant portion of the inflows is believed to come from institutional players who now have a regulated and familiar vehicle to allocate capital to Bitcoin. Performance of Bitcoin: The underlying asset, Bitcoin, has seen significant price appreciation, which naturally increases the AUM of the fund holding it. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investment and the Market? The rapid growth of IBIT, alongside other successful spot Bitcoin ETF s launched simultaneously, has profound implications: Increased Legitimacy: The sheer volume of money flowing into these regulated products signals growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class by mainstream finance and investors. Bridging the Gap: ETFs like IBIT act as a crucial bridge, connecting traditional financial markets with the nascent world of cryptocurrency. Potential for Further Growth: The ease of access provided by the Fastest Growing ETF could attract even more capital from individuals and institutions who were previously hesitant to enter the crypto space directly. Impact on Bitcoin Price: The consistent buying pressure from these ETFs, including BlackRock IBIT , is a significant factor influencing Bitcoin’s supply and demand dynamics, potentially impacting its price. Considering a Spot Bitcoin ETF? What You Should Know For investors looking at IBIT or other spot Bitcoin ETF s as a way to add crypto exposure to their portfolio, here are a few points to consider: Volatility: While ETFs offer convenience, the underlying asset (Bitcoin) remains highly volatile. The value of your investment can fluctuate significantly. Fees: ETFs charge management fees, which can eat into returns over time. Compare fees across different providers. Not Direct Ownership: Investing in an ETF means you own shares in the fund, not actual Bitcoin. This is important if direct control or potential future staking/yield opportunities are a priority. Due Diligence: Understand the fund’s structure, holdings, and the risks associated with investing in cryptocurrency before committing capital. The Future is Bright for Crypto Investment Accessibility The success of BlackRock IBIT as the Fastest Growing ETF is more than just a financial statistic; it’s a landmark event in the history of Crypto Investment . It demonstrates strong market demand for regulated, accessible Bitcoin products and highlights the increasing integration of digital assets into the global financial system. While challenges and market volatility remain, the rapid adoption of vehicles like the Spot Bitcoin ETF offered by BlackRock suggests a future where crypto assets play a more prominent role in diversified investment portfolios.

2025-06-10T10:35:39,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Axelar, Hyperliquid lead crypto bounce ahead of Fed meeting","The cryptocurrency market is regaining its bullish momentum, with major tokens like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Axelar (AXL), and Hyperliquid (HYPE) posting impressive gains as investors brace for the Federal Reserve’s pivotal June 18 meeting. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has climbed 3.5% to trade at $109,376, while Ethereum has surged 7.5% to $2,677.46, reinforcing a broader recovery trend following recent selling pressure. Axelar has emerged as one of today’s crypto top performers, rallying by an astonishing 90.2% in a single day and nearly doubling its price to $0.6041, underscoring renewed appetite for interoperability-focused projects. Hyperliquid also joined the rally, gaining 11.1% to trade at $39.29, further extending its weekly rise to 8.7%, supported by a growing narrative around decentralized liquidity protocols. Notably, these cryptocurrencies are leading a pack of other coins as the cryptocurrency market rebound after a slight dip over the weekend and into Monday. Amid this bounce back, the global market cap has jumped to $3.38 trillion. US-China trade talks optimism spurs BTC’s bullish momentum Bitcoin’s recovery follows a multi-day consolidation and reflects growing confidence as short-term headwinds appear to be fading. Fueled by a renewed wave of optimism around US-China trade talks , BTC rose nearly 4% since Monday, reversing losses triggered by cautious sentiment earlier this month. The latest round of trade negotiations in London has reignited hopes of tariff relief, boosting overall risk appetite across financial markets. Historically, positive developments in US-China relations have triggered broad-based rallies in equities and digital assets alike, and this round is proving no different. As a result, investors are reallocating capital from traditional safe-haven assets into high-yield instruments, with Bitcoin sitting at the forefront of that shift. Additionally, technical indicators such as the breakout from a bull flag pattern point to a potential price target near $158,000, giving traders a compelling reason to stay bullish. Ethereum is riding the institutional optimism Ethereum (ETH) has significantly outperformed Bitcoin (BTC) over the past day, rallying over 7% and strengthening its position above $2,670. The rise in ETH reflects increasing institutional confidence, with many traders interpreting the improved regulatory environment as a green light for broader altcoin exposure. Recent commentary from SEC Chairman Paul Atkins supporting DeFi self-custody rights has fueled this sentiment, offering clarity long sought by crypto-native developers and investors. Furthermore, Ethereum’s ecosystem is benefiting from heightened activity around staking and layer-2 adoption, helping reinforce its long-term growth narrative. As Bitcoin ETFs expand, some institutions are now exploring Ethereum allocations as a natural extension of their crypto strategies. Axelar explosion pegged on the hype around its platform Axelar’s 90.2% daily surge is among the most notable market moves this week, catapulting its market cap to $569 million amid explosive volume of over $353 million. The token’s sharp rally appears driven by a growing narrative around blockchain interoperability and the increasing importance of cross-chain communication protocols. As developers search for scalable and seamless ways to connect disparate blockchain ecosystems, Axelar’s value proposition is coming into sharper focus. Market participants are also speculating on the project’s potential involvement in broader institutional frameworks, adding fuel to an already accelerating rally. The 79.8% weekly gain further signals sustained buying pressure, pointing to continued confidence among both retail and strategic investors. Hyperliquid is extending its gains as DeFi rotation picks up Hyperliquid’s 11.1% daily rise builds on a strong weekly performance, with its price now hovering near $39.29 and its market cap topping $13 billion. The surge reflects renewed interest in DeFi-native tokens, particularly those focused on liquidity provision, decentralized exchanges, and derivative markets. Traders have increasingly turned to HYPE as a proxy for broader participation in decentralized financial infrastructure amid mounting skepticism toward centralized platforms. As derivative volumes climb and open interest continues to grow, projects like Hyperliquid are drawing in fresh capital, benefiting from structural tailwinds. The token’s rising price and expanding market cap suggest investors are positioning for further growth in decentralized trading ecosystems. FOMC uncertainty is fueling the crypto momentum While the various cryptocurrencies including Axelar, Hyperliquid, Bitcoin, Ethereum and others like Fartcoin and dogwifhat that have also seen double digit gains, are rebounding strongly, underlying macroeconomic tensions remain in play ahead of the Federal Reserve’s June 18 meeting. The CME FedWatch Tool shows a near-unanimous 99.9% expectation that interest rates will remain steady, driven by strong job data and sticky inflation. Despite external pressure, including rate cuts from the European Central Bank and vocal demands from Donald Trump, the Fed is unlikely to shift policy just yet. This policy consistency has brought some temporary relief to the crypto market, which often reacts sharply to changes in interest rate outlooks. At the same time, analysts are warning that certain bearish signals, such as a potential head and shoulders pattern on Bitcoin’s chart, could still drag prices lower. Nonetheless, with derivatives volume surging and over $195 million in shorts liquidated in the last 24 hours alone, bulls currently hold the upper hand. Crypto market outlook hinges on Fed and CPI data Looking forward, the crypto market’s resilience will be tested further as investors await both the FOMC decision and new inflation data from the Consumer Price Index. Should inflation cool and the Fed hold rates steady, the existing rally may extend, particularly if macro sentiment continues to favor risk assets. However, a surprise from either event could spark renewed volatility, keeping traders on edge despite the recent bullish surge. For now, Axelar, Hyperliquid, Bitcoin, and Ethereum are leading the charge, suggesting that investor sentiment is growing increasingly optimistic as the crypto market navigates a delicate macroeconomic landscape.

2025-06-10T10:34:53,"Hackers Target Paraguayan President’s X Account in Bitcoin Legal Tender Scam","A false announcement claiming Paraguay had adopted Bitcoin as legal tender was posted from President Santiago Peña’s hacked X account, prompting swift clarification from the government and raising concerns over digital platform vulnerabilities. Bitcoin Community Misled by Presidential Account Hack A fraudulent post from Paraguayan President Santiago Peña’s personal X account caused a brief stir across the cryptocurrency world on Monday. The post, written in English, falsely declared that Paraguay had made Bitcoin legal tender and had established a $5 million BTC reserve, even including a wallet address for alleged “investment” purposes. The post read, ""Investors: your investment today will determine the scale of this rollout. Secure your stake in Bitcoin."" This messaging marked a stark departure from Peña’s typical posts, which are almost exclusively in Spanish. Government Responds Swiftly The excitement surrounding the announcement was short-lived. Paraguay’s presidential office quickly issued a statement from its official X account, confirming that the president’s personal account had been accessed by an unauthorized party. Citizens were urged to disregard any unverified posts from Peña’s profile until the matter was resolved. The presidential office noted it was working with X to “clarify the situation” and reminded the public that only information disseminated through verified government channels should be trusted. Peña Acknowledges Breach Hours after the fraudulent post was taken down, President Peña addressed the breach in a new message from his restored account. He thanked both Paraguay’s Cyber Incident Response Team (CERTpy) and X’s internal security team for their role in handling the incident: “I express my appreciation to the CERTpy and X teams for their quick and professional response to the security incident on my official X account. Cybersecurity is key, and these events show us that we must all contribute to building a safe, reliable, and resilient digital ecosystem.” As of publication, the misleading post had been deleted while the government’s statement remains live on the platform. Broader Concerns Over Crypto Scams The incident highlights ongoing concerns about the use of social media platforms like X.com as vectors for crypto scams. High-profile figures have frequently been targeted by hackers to promote false crypto announcements. In 2021, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s account was similarly compromised to claim that India had adopted Bitcoin as legal tender. In another case, the U.S. SEC’s X account was breached earlier this year through a SIM-swap attack that led to the false announcement of BTC ETF approvals. Paraguay’s Crypto Status Although Paraguay has attracted notable Bitcoin mining activity, particularly from firms like HIVE, the country has not taken formal steps toward adopting Bitcoin as legal tender. Unlike El Salvador, which did so in 2021 under President Nayib Bukele, Paraguay has yet to establish a comprehensive crypto regulatory framework. The false post coincided with renewed regional discussions on digital assets, spurred in part by El Salvador’s ongoing Bitcoin experiment and its complex negotiations with the International Monetary Fund.

2025-06-10T10:30:55,"Why The Bitcoin Price Could See Another 70%-170% Jump From Here","The Bitcoin price is still holding above $100,000 despite suffering a crash right before the weekend. It has since bounced back from the $104,000 level, suggesting that bulls are making their stand at this major psychological level. Now, with the crypto market sitting at what looks to be a critical point, questions are arising about what the next step could be from here. Can Bitcoin still rally, or is this the end of a rather short and underwhelming bull market? Bitcoin Price Still Has A Long Way To Go Crypto analyst Doctor Profit has been a vocal voice when it comes to the bullishness of the Bitcoin price. He has continued to call for higher prices even at a time when the wider community is expecting the cryptocurrency to keep falling from here. In fact, the crypto analyst believes that the leading crypto could see its price double from here, despite already hitting multiple new all-time highs. Related Reading: Ethereum Head & Shoulders Pattern Breakdown: Can Bulls Reclaim Control? In a post on X, Doctor Profit explained the reasoning behind this and why he believes that the Bitcoin price still has room to run. The first thing he pointed to was the fact that a rare Golden Cross had appeared on the Bitcoin price chart. This happened three weeks ago, and back then, the analyst called out the chart formation, explaining that this meant that the bull run was not over. This is because every time Bitcoin had flashed a Golden Cross in the past, it had been the start of another massive run. Just like now, it is first followed by a 10% decline in price, which was achieved when Bitcoin fell from $111,900 to $100,000. Now that the first part of the trend seems to have been fulfilled, expectations are that the other parts will play out similarly. In addition to this, he explains that Bitcoin has also formed its diagonal resistance, which it is now looking to break out from. A successful break would put it back above $108,000 as it gears up for the next leg-up. Macro Factors That Support The Thesis Not only does the chart technicals show this possible recovery, but the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, expected to be released on Wednesday, plays into this as well. Doctor Profit explains that Wall Street is already expecting the CPI to come in at 2.5%, a rather high number. Related Reading: Dogecoin’s Growth Pattern Hints At Massive June–July Rally After 5-Month Pullback Instead, he believes that the CPI will come in lower, putting it between 2.1% and 2.3%. A lower figure would mean that there is a slowdown in inflation, allowing room for more risk-taking and pushing markets such as stocks and crypto higher. Also, there is the matter of the negative funding rate, which suggests that there are more shorters in the market right now, expecting the price to tank. Data from Coinglass shows the Bitcoin funding rate has dropped to one of the lowest levels this year, and the analyst says this is a sign of a healthy market. “Overall, I see a strong trend and markets will continue to rise with first targets between 108-110k, and this is by far not the end,” Doctor Profit said. “The golden cross is promising us between 70-170% in gains in the coming months!” Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-70-170-jump/,"BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT",cryptocompare

2025-06-10T10:26:26,"Bitcoin Nears Record High, But Analysts Warn of Looming Correction","Bitcoin is closing in on its all-time high of $111,970 , trading at $109,519 at the time of writing. While the milestone appears within reach, analysts warn that the cryptocurrency may struggle to push higher without a meaningful catalyst. In a report published Monday, Bitfinex analysts highlighted growing risks of a short-term correction, cautioning that the current rally lacks fundamental support. “The risk of a short-term correction continues to build — especially in the absence of a strong catalyst to push Bitcoin decisively above the current all-time high,” they said. The analysts pointed to long-term holders, many of whom bought in Q1 2025 when BTC dipped as low as $78,513, as critical to the market’s next move. Those investors are now sitting on gains of around 39%, and whether they choose to take profits or hold could determine Bitcoin’s near-term direction. Decision Time for Long-Term Holders As Bitcoin flirts with its all-time high , holders from earlier in the year are faced with a pivotal choice. “Market participants still holding coins from Q1 2025, and who held through the sharp drawdown below $80,000, are now being tested as the price churns sideways near ATH levels,” Bitfinex noted. The firm warned that if long-term holders start selling in large numbers, Bitcoin could enter a prolonged consolidation phase — something it has done in the past. In 2024, Bitcoin hit a then-record of $73,679 in March but traded sideways for months before gaining momentum again after the U.S. presidential election in November. Adding to market tension, CoinGlass data shows that roughly $1.08 billion in short positions could be liquidated if BTC breaks above its previous high, potentially triggering rapid price moves in either direction. Bitcoin Traders Await Fed Decision and Political Clarity Macro events may be the deciding factor in Bitcoin’s next big move. The Federal Reserve is scheduled to announce its next interest rate decision on June 18. Any hint of rate cuts could act as a bullish trigger for BTC and other risk-on assets. Meanwhile, geopolitical uncertainty continues to cloud investor sentiment. Swyftx lead analyst Pav Hundal noted that persistent tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump could stall the BTC rally. “The biggest threat to bulls right now is that nothing changes over the next two months, and we just stay trapped in this cycle of endless tariff ultimatums,” Hundal said.

2025-06-10T10:21:10,"Top 7 Reasons Why the Ethereum Price Rally is Coming Soon","The post Top 7 Reasons Why the Ethereum Price Rally is Coming Soon appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum may be under pressure on the charts, but behind the scenes, bullish signals are rapidly stacking up. Despite a 1.82% drop today and a 26.75% decline over the past year, a prominent crypto analyst known as Unipcs—also referred to as “ Bonk Guy “—has outlined several key factors that could spark a powerful ETH rally. Ethereum ETFs See Massive Inflows One of the most bullish trends cited by Bonk Guy is the consistent inflow into Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). According to Coinglass data, ETH ETFs have now posted 15 consecutive days of positive inflows. BlackRock’s ETHA led with $35.2 million in a single day Fidelity’s FETH followed with $12.9 million Grayscale’s ETH added $4.6 million On June 3 alone , ETH ETFs recorded a massive $109.5 million in inflows—marking the highest single-day inflow for Ethereum ETFs so far this month. Corporates Are Holding Ethereum Bonk Guy notes a shift among institutions adopting Ethereum as a treasury asset. In a headline-grabbing move, SharpLink Gaming closed a $425 million private placement , led by ConsenSys Software Inc, to implement one of the largest Ethereum treasury strategies in public markets. This signals growing corporate confidence in ETH, mirroring the Bitcoin-focused approach seen with MicroStrategy. ETH Staking Approval in ETFs May Be Near Regulatory signals suggest that ETH staking could soon be allowed in ETF structures. If approved, it could unlock significant institutional inflows and act as a major bullish catalyst for Ethereum. Short Squeeze Ahead? The analyst also pointed out that many funds and traders are currently shorting ETH. Should the price reverse upward, it could trigger a short squeeze , amplifying gains as traders rush to cover positions. Meanwhile, weekly active Ethereum addresses have hit record highs, showing surging user engagement and strengthening the case for long-term growth. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Arthur Hayes Predicts Bitcoin Surge If Bank of Japan Eases Policy , ETH Supply on Exchanges Is Shrinking Ethereum supply on exchanges is dropping fast—a sign that traders are moving assets to cold storage or staking, reducing sell pressure. Notable 30-day ETH outflows include: Bitfinex : -572,946 ETH Coinbase Pro : -2,149 ETH OKX : -13,627 ETH Kraken : -6,428 ETH Bithumb : -19,572 ETH In total, top exchanges including Binance and Coinbase saw a combined decline of over 261,000 ETH . All-Time High Staking and Layer 2 Boom The Ethereum ecosystem is also expanding, with over 34.6 million ETH now staked , locking up a significant portion of supply. Moreover, Layer 2 networks like Base are showing explosive growth, pointing to increasing scalability and mainstream adoption. Bottom Line: While Ethereum’s price performance may look disappointing in the short term, on-chain data, ETF inflows, treasury adoption, and growing network activity all hint at a potential breakout rally on the horizon. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Ethereum’s price is up today due to continued strong inflows into ETH ETFs (e.g., BlackRock, Fidelity), rising institutional confidence, a shrinking supply on exchanges, and the overall positive sentiment in the crypto market with Bitcoin approaching $110,000. How will the upcoming US CPI data impact Ethereum’s (ETH) price? The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, due out this Wednesday, is crucial. If inflation data is higher than expected, it could dampen crypto sentiment and ETH price. Conversely, lower-than-expected CPI could trigger gains for ETH. What will the price of Ethereum be in 2025?

Accordingly, Hoskinson announced the launch of Cardinal, the first Bitcoin DeFi protocol on the Cardano network. Cardano has launched the Cardinal Protocol for Bitcoin (BTC) DeFi. Cardano now enables BTC lending, staking, and more without central custody and without the need for third-party custodians. The Cardinal Protocol allows users to put their Bitcoin to work by lending, borrowing, or staking on the Cardano blockchain. Related News: Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson Talks About Bitcoin (BTC), ADA, and XRP! Outlines His Plans! Cardinal is seen as a groundbreaking innovation for BTC and ADA, being the first solution to allow Bitcoin to access the Cardano ecosystem without requiring custody. Finally, it was noted that Cardinal uses the secure MuSig2 multi-signature system. This method enables peg-in and peg-out transactions, keeps everything open and verifiable, and is also compatible with the Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Avalanche (AVAX) networks. Cardano CTO Romain Pellerin said that Cardinal Protocol is a big step forward and that there are some new innovations on the way. Future upgrades could include wallet support, zero-knowledge proofs, and deeper liquidity. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-10T10:12:32,"Arthur Hayes Predicts Bitcoin Surge If Bank of Japan Eases Policy","The post Arthur Hayes Predicts Bitcoin Surge If Bank of Japan Eases Policy appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX, suggested that if Japan’s top bank, the Bank of Japan (BoJ), decides to boost the economy by printing more money instead of trying to slow down rising prices, it might set Bitcoin and Ethereum up for a big jump. Let’s see why! BoJ’s Big Decision on June 17th For a long time, the BoJ has been strict, saying that inflation is still above where they’d like it to be. But with the central bank’s next big meeting coming up on June 17th , Hayes sees a chance for a different approach. He believes that if the BoJ stops tightening its money policy and goes back to helping the economy by printing more money (quantitative easing, or QE), then Bitcoin could surge higher . This isn’t just about Bitcoin. Hayes pointed out that while some people in Japan might not like the idea of easier money, it could mean good news for risky assets in general. What’s Going on in Japan? Japan has been known for keeping its interest rates low for a long time compared to other countries like the U.S. and Europe. This helps families and companies borrow money easily, but it also makes Japan’s money, the yen, weaker. A weaker yen means that things that Japan buys from other countries get more expensive. Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda has hinted that they’re not rushing to tighten money conditions, which could continue until 2026. Since other big central banks, like the U.S. Federal Reserve, have been raising rates, Japan’s slow pace of change is giving investors a chance to borrow yen at lower costs. Many see this as a way to invest in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which is seen as a safer haven during inflation. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Top 7 Reasons Why the Ethereum Price Rally is Coming Soon , Money Flowing Into Bitcoin If Japan decides to change its money policy, it could trigger another big pump in crypto.

2025-06-10T10:00:59,"Perfect Storm Of Fundamentals And Technicals Puts XRP Price At $10 – Details","The XRP price and its trajectory have been one of the most debated in the crypto community after a rapid surge that saw its price rise 600% back in 2024. Since then, the altcoin has slowed down and has been skirting support around the $2 level, with bears unable to break this level so far. With support holding so strong, expectations are that a renewed and sustained bullish momentum will begin, and this time, analysts are putting the XRP price in the double-digits. XRP Price Forms Classic Bullish Flag Pattern Crypto analyst Persian Blockchain has made bold predictions for the XRP price as the altcoin has seen the formation os a classic bullish flag pattern. This pattern emerged with the rise and subsequent fall in the XRP price and has continued to show signs of more bullishness to come. One important factor that the crypto analyst points out is the fact that classic bullish flag patterns are a continuation structure. This means they often signal the start of an upward movement, most likely to push toward the previous peaks seen with the last rally . As expected, there are still some resistances on the chart that the XRP price will have to clear. In this case, the crypto analyst highlights a level like the $2.7 resistance, which is the level to beat. As they explain, if the XRP price is able to successfully break above the resistance and then enter the buy zone, then a breakout could be expected. The crypto analyst said: “A retest of the breakout area followed by bullish confirmation could signal the beginning of a larger move toward the $10 psychological level.” This would mean an over 400% move from the altcoin to push it toward brand new all-time highs. Ripple Vs. SEC Lawsuit Plays A Role So far, the long-running Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit has played a huge role in suppressing the XRP price over the years, and even now, continues to loom over the digital asset. There is yet to be a final conclusion to the legal battle, although the court’s rulings have been leaning toward a favorable outcome for Ripple. The crypto analyst points to the SEC’s 60-day deadline coming to an end on June 16, and if the courts rule in favour of Ripple, then this could spark a fresh rally. Moreover, there has also been a rise in global liquidity, and as the stock market and Bitcoin are expected to rise, the XRP price will rise in tandem as one of the largest cryptocurrencies in the market. A positive outcome and final conclusion to the SEC battle would renew confidence in XRP and possibly drive new investments. “The alignment of a legal breakthrough, improving macro liquidity, and a bullish chart structure makes this a scenario worth watching closely,” the analyst concluded.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-at-10-details/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","XRP|crypto|crypto news|ripple|ripple news|Ripple price|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT",cryptocompare

2025-06-10T09:59:05,"Bitcoin Flirts With $107K as Trade-Talk Optimism Fuels Risk Rally","Bitcoin price today sits at $109,377 with the U.S.–China trade talks igniting investor sentiment about the possibility of easing global trade tensions. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Inflows Skyrocket BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has set a new record by becoming the fastest ETF ever to surpass $70 billion in assets under management, reaching this milestone in just 341 trading days since its launch. Calling out this development, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas pointed out , “ IBIT just blew through $70b and is now the fastest ETF to ever hit that mark in only 341 days, which is 5x faster than the old record held by GLD of 1,691 days.” Consider this, the previous record-holder, SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), needed 1,691 days to hit $70 billion. IBIT achieved the same feat about five times faster, illustrating a high adoption rate. BlackRock’s IBIT now holds over 660,000 BTC—outpacing MicroStrategy’s 582,000 and inching closer to Satoshi Nakamoto’s legendary 1.12 million. This milestone aligns with growing institutional interest, as crypto ETFs saw a $224 million inflow last week, driven by strong IBIT performance. With a 2023 NBER study suggesting that institutional buying could stabilize crypto markets in the long term, ETFs will continue to be a game-changer in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Meanwhile, a supply shock looms in the BTC network with exchange balances recently hitting a 7-year low, hinting at a growing hodling trend. Therefore, heigthened ETF inflows, robust institutional interest, and the possibility of a supply shock continue to paint a bullish Bitcoin picture. Bitcoin Enthusiasts Keep Fingers Crossed about the U.S.–China Trade Talks The ongoing U.S.–China trade talks are injecting a fresh dose of optimism into global markets, with Bitcoin among the major beneficiaries. Market analysts point to easing trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies as a key driver behind Bitcoin’s recent surge, which saw the flagship cryptocurrency rebound to the psychological price of $110,000. This has spurred positive sentiment among investors seeking refuge in alternative assets like Bitcoin, which historically performs well amid economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Experts say the renewed optimism stems from expectations that a thaw in trade tensions could stabilize global supply chains, reduce inflationary pressures, and bolster risk-on assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies. “When trade tensions ease, investors tend to rotate capital into higher-risk, higher-reward assets,” explains Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors. “Bitcoin stands to benefit from that tailwind.” On the macroeconomic front, traders are closely watching the Federal Reserve’s signals. While the Fed has kept interest rates steady at 4.25% since April, the market is now pricing in a potential rate cut by September, adding to the bullish sentiment for risk assets like Bitcoin. With U.S.–China trade negotiations progressing, supply chain issues easing, Bitcoin enthusiasts are betting on a sustained rally. Conclusion With Bitcoin being a stone’s throw away from reclaiming its historical price of $111,814 bullish sentiments continue to rock its ecosystem. For instance, BlackRock is leading the pack in terms of soaring Bitcoin ETF inflows, illustrating heightened institutional adoption. With the world’s largest cryptocurrency expected to be a major beneficiary of the trade talks between China and the U.S., it might be a matter of time before BTC sets a new price record, which might ignite a crypto market rally.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9507/bitcoin-flirts-with-107-k-as-trade-talk-optimism-fuels-risk-rally,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

Dogecoin added over 5% to trade near 19 cents as of Asian afternoon hours Tuesday, while Cardano’s ADA rose more than 5% as risk appetite returned after last week’s volatility. Overall market capitalization rose more than 3%, with the broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) adding 4%. The rebound came as traders continued to digest the latest US-China trade developments and braced for key inflation data this week that could set the tone for interest rate expectations. “Bitcoin surged to around $110K as US-China trade talks resumed while the SEC greenlights new crypto ETFs, giving investors a renewed bullish sentiment,” said Augustine Fan, Head of Insights at SignalPlus, in an email to CoinDesk. “We anticipate a continuation of the bullish trends as crypto attracts more institutions and retail investors with innovations and competitive returns.” Kay Lu, CEO of HashKey Eco Labs, said the market’s reaction to the Trump-Musk spat last week may have been overdone. “We’re seeing some market recovery as fundamentals remain strong,” Lu said. “The CPI data on Wednesday could be a key catalyst for price moves.” Meanwhile, Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE, warned that the current cycle may not be straightforward. “We’re seeing more options for investors to get crypto exposure, whether through ETFs, corporate treasuries, or stablecoin issuers,” Mei said. “This cycle will be more nuanced as crypto matures as a macro asset class.” Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, noted that Bitcoin’s price action above $109,000 showed resilience in the face of mixed signals. “Bitcoin’s climb amid geopolitical and macro headwinds reinforces its standing as a macro asset class,” Ruck said. “ETF momentum has put crypto back on the radar for mainstream investors.”",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/10/what-next-as-ether-zooms-7-doge-leads-majors-gains-amid-bitcoin-euphoria,"BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|Markets|Trading|DOGE|Ether|News",cryptocompare

2025-06-10T09:55:19,"Plasma raises $500m in oversubscribed XPL token sale for stablecoin-focused blockchain","Plasma, a startup focused on stablecoins, raised an impressive $500 million in its latest public token offering, far surpassing its initial target. On June 9, Plasma announced on X that its public token sale for XPL sold out in just 40 minutes. The team initially planned to raise $50 million but had to revise it twice, first to $250 million, then to $500 million, after overwhelming interest from buyers. In total, more than 1,100 wallets participated in the token sale, with a median deposit of approximately $35,000 per wallet. The XPL token sale accounted for 10% of Plasma’s total token supply, implying a fully diluted valuation of $500 million, consistent with the valuation from its earlier equity round, which was backed by Founders Fund. Participants in the sale were required to deposit stablecoins into a vault hosted on Ethereum, with support for USDT, USDC, USDS, and DAI. Unlike traditional first-come-first-served token launches, Plasma implemented a time-weighted deposit model that rewarded early and longer-held deposits with a greater allocation of tokens. All deposits were processed through smart contracts audited by Veda, a well-regarded blockchain infrastructure firm. At the time of the sale, Veda’s audited contracts managed over $2.6 billion in total value locked, lending credibility and security assurances to the process.

Plasma is a blockchain designed to enable fast, scalable, and low-fee stablecoin transactions. It is a Bitcoin sidechain that is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, which allows it to support a wide range of decentralized finance applications while benefiting from Bitcoin’s robust security layer. The XPL token will function as the native cryptocurrency of Plasma’s planned blockchain. By optimizing for stablecoin transactions and enabling zero-fee USDT transfers, Plasma wants to position itself as a high-performance settlement layer for payments, remittances, and DeFi services. Plasma has steadily drawn the attention of top-tier investors since late 2024, including Founders Fund, Framework Ventures, and Bitfinex . The project kicked off with a $3.5 million seed round in October 2024, followed by a $20 million Series A in February 2025, led by Framework and joined by Nomura, Bybit, and 6th Man Ventures. Plasma’s token sale comes at a time when major jurisdictions across the globe are advancing stablecoin regulation. For instance, regulators in the United States recently moved forward with the GENIUS Act , a bipartisan proposal that would establish a federal framework for payment stablecoins. Meanwhile, last year, the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets framework (MICA) came into force, with stablecoin provisions taking effect in June 2024 and full implementation coming into effect by the end of December.

2025-06-10T09:50:21,"US Stock Markets Rise: Unlocking Critical Insights for Crypto","BitcoinWorld US Stock Markets Rise: Unlocking Critical Insights for Crypto Hey there, fellow market watchers! The financial world is always buzzing, and today, we’re kicking things off with a look at traditional finance. Specifically, the US stock markets have opened higher today. Now, you might be thinking, “Why should I care about stocks if I’m focused on crypto?” Great question! While crypto marches to its own beat in many ways, understanding broader stock market trends can offer valuable context for navigating the volatile world of digital assets. Let’s dive into what’s happening and why it matters. Understanding the US Stock Markets Open At the start of trading today, major indices in the United States showed positive momentum. Here’s a quick look at the numbers: Index Change S&P500 +0.07% NASDAQ +0.08% Dow Jones Industrial Average (Dow) +0.06% These are modest gains, certainly not earth-shattering moves, but they signal a positive start to the trading day in traditional finance. The S&P 500 is often seen as a benchmark for the overall health of large U.S. companies, the NASDAQ is heavily weighted towards technology stocks, and the Dow represents 30 large, publicly owned companies. Exploring Crypto Market Correlation So, how does a slightly higher open in the US stock markets potentially relate to the crypto world? This is where the concept of crypto market correlation comes into play. In recent years, especially as cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have gained more mainstream attention and institutional investment, their price movements have sometimes shown a correlation with traditional risk assets, particularly tech stocks represented by the NASDAQ. Here’s the thinking: Risk-On Sentiment: When investors feel confident about the economy and are willing to take on more risk, they often invest in assets perceived as having higher growth potential, such as technology stocks and, increasingly, cryptocurrencies. A positive open in stocks can sometimes reflect or contribute to this ‘risk-on’ sentiment. Macroeconomic Factors: The same big economic news that moves stocks (like inflation data, interest rate decisions, employment numbers) also influences investor sentiment and capital flows globally, impacting crypto markets as well. Investor Overlap: As more traditional investors allocate a portion of their portfolios to crypto, their decisions might be influenced by their overall market outlook, which is heavily tied to stock market performance. It’s important to note that this correlation isn’t always perfect or consistent. Crypto markets have unique drivers like regulatory news, technological developments (protocol upgrades, new projects), and adoption rates that can cause them to diverge significantly from stock market trends. What’s the Potential Bitcoin Price Impact? Given the potential crypto market correlation , what could a positive open in the US stock markets mean for the Bitcoin price impact ? While a 0.06-0.08% rise in stocks is tiny by Bitcoin’s volatile standards, it contributes to the overall market sentiment picture. Think of it this way: A positive stock open adds a small green signal to the global financial dashboard. If this positive trend continues throughout the day and is driven by strong underlying economic signals, it could reinforce ‘risk-on’ behavior that might spill over into demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Conversely, if stocks had opened sharply lower, it might signal broad risk aversion, potentially putting downward pressure on crypto prices. However, it’s crucial not to overstate the immediate Bitcoin price impact of such small stock movements. Bitcoin and the broader crypto market are known for their significant intraday volatility, often moving several percentage points in either direction based on crypto-specific news or market dynamics that have nothing to do with stocks. Analyzing Broader Stock Market Trends for Crypto Clues Beyond the daily open, keeping an eye on general stock market trends can provide valuable insights for crypto investors. Are tech stocks leading the way? Is the market reacting positively or negatively to inflation reports? These larger trends often reflect the prevailing market sentiment regarding economic growth, inflation, and the future path of monetary policy – all factors that have shown a clear influence on crypto markets over time. For instance: When central banks signal tighter monetary policy (raising interest rates, reducing stimulus), both stocks (especially growth stocks) and crypto have historically faced headwinds as investors become more cautious. When inflation appears to be cooling, it can sometimes lead to a rally in both asset classes as the pressure for aggressive rate hikes eases. Monitoring how traditional markets digest major economic news can offer a sneak peek into the macro environment that crypto also operates within. It’s like checking the weather report for the broader financial climate. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what can you actually do with this information about US stock markets and their slight rise today? Here are a few actionable insights: Use it as a Sentiment Indicator: View the stock market’s open and daily trend as one data point among many for assessing overall market sentiment . A strong upward trend in stocks, particularly tech, might suggest a favorable environment for risk assets, including crypto. Observe Correlation (But Don’t Rely Solely On It): Pay attention to whether crypto is following stock movements on a given day or week. Is the crypto market correlation strong or weak? This can help you understand the current market dynamics, but always remember that crypto can decouple rapidly. Understand the Macro Drivers: Look into *why* stocks are moving. Is there specific economic news? This underlying reason is often more important than the movement itself, as those macro factors directly influence crypto as well. Manage Expectations: Don’t expect a 0.07% rise in the S&P 500 to cause Bitcoin to jump 5%. Stock market moves are typically much smaller in percentage terms than crypto moves. Use stock market data for context, not as a direct price predictor. The benefit here isn’t a guaranteed trading signal, but rather a more holistic understanding of the financial landscape. Challenges include the imperfect nature of the correlation and the need to filter out the noise – small daily stock moves are less significant than major trend shifts or reactions to big economic events. In Conclusion: A Piece of the Puzzle Today’s higher open in the US stock markets is a small positive signal from the traditional financial world. While the direct, immediate Bitcoin price impact of such minor moves is limited, monitoring broader stock market trends and understanding their potential crypto market correlation offers valuable context for crypto investors. It helps us gauge overall market sentiment and understand the macroeconomic forces at play. Remember, successful navigation of the crypto market involves looking at a wide range of indicators, from on-chain data and regulatory news to global economic signals, including those from traditional markets like stocks.

2025-06-10T09:47:04,"Market Veteran Reveals How to Spot Bitcoin Cycle Top Using the 200W SMA","A top market analyst has highlighted how the movement of the 200W SMA indicator has marked the cyclical top for Bitcoin and what it means for current prices. Benjamin Cowen, the founder of Into The Cryptoverse, identified this trend in an X post on June 10. He drew the data from Bitcoin’s historical tops in correlation with the 200-week simple moving average (SMA), emphasizing how it affects current prices.This follows Bitcoin’s close above $110,000 yesterday. The leading cryptocurrency by market cap rallied 4% on Monday to an intraday high of $110,617 before moving a bit lower.Bitcoin Cyclical Top’s Correlation With the 200W SMACowen noted that Bitcoin’s price action and the 200-week SMA have a pattern: the indicator has consistently predicted its cyclical top. For the uninitiated, the moving average calculates the average closing price of Bitcoin over the past 200 weeks.Historically, BTC usually reaches its top for the cycle when the weekly indicator crosses its all-time high from the previous cycle.An accompanying chart further confirms this correlation. For perspective, Bitcoin topped at $1,242 in November 2013 when the 200W SMA crossed its previous high. The same happened with the ATH of $19,804 in December 2017. Specifically, the 2017 cycle peak occurred when the 200W SMA reached $1,157, aligning with the $1,242 ATH from 2013. This pattern also played out with the $69,000 peak price in November 2021. Notably, when Bitcoin hit the November 2021 high of $69,000, the 200W SMA had climbed close to the previous cycle's peak. This marked the top for the 2021 bull run. Bitcoin Top Correlation With the 200W SMA | Benjamin Cowen More Upsides for Bitcoin?Meanwhile, according to the chart, the 200W moving average has yet to reach 2021’s ATH. In fact, the chart shows it has more ground to cover to get the extended line from the price high. For context, the 200W SMA stands at $48,353, a difference of $20,644 from the 2021's peak of $68,997.As a result, Cowen’s analysis suggests Bitcoin has more upside from here. While he did not mention a specific price target in the Tuesday analysis, he stressed it is “something to keep in mind.”Interestingly, other analyses align with this bullish outlook. Earlier, Klarch highlighted a similar cyclical recurrence in Bitcoin, suggesting further upside to $180,000 per coin. His optimism hinges on the idea that, according to the cyclical timeline, there is more time for further upside and continued capital influx into the crypto market.Furthermore, other bullish predictions, including a rally to $200,000 and $250,000 , remain in place. In the meantime, Bitcoin trades at $109,274, with its market cap surpassing $2.1 trillion.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/10/market-veteran-reveals-how-to-spot-bitcoin-cycle-top-using-the-200w-sma/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=market-veteran-reveals-how-to-spot-bitcoin-cycle-top-using-the-200w-sma,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Market|Bitcoin Price Prediction|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today",cryptocompare

2025-06-10T09:43:59,"If Bitcoin Closes Above this Level, It Confirms Its Inverted Ascending Scallop, Targeting $244K","Analyst SuperBro notes that a Bitcoin close above the key level would confirm his inverted ascending scallop pattern, potentially leading to higher prices. Bitcoin’s price has experienced a clear upward trend over the past week, seeing a significant jump from below $104,000 to over $110,000. As of today, Bitcoin is trading at $109,318, showing a 3.5% increase in the last 24 hours and a slight 0.1% rise over the past 7 days. Following this surge, an analyst on X suggests Bitcoin might be poised for a broader surge, even reaching new highs based on an inverted ascending scallop.Technical Patterns and Price TargetsThe chart analysis shared by crypto analyst SuperBro highlights the formation of an ""Inverted Ascending Scallop"" pattern on Bitcoin's weekly price chart. This pattern unfolds in multiple phases, beginning with a rise from $49,500 in August 2024 to a peak of $109,000 on January 20, 2025. From there, Bitcoin dipped to $74,400 in early April before making a comeback. This upward trend has brought the price back near the January peak, with the final phase projecting further increases.SuperBro highlights that if Bitcoin records a weekly close above $109,358, it will confirm the inverted ascending scallop pattern, which he has continued to watch since February 2025. Interestingly, the analyst provides two potential price targets for Bitcoin. The conservative target, based on a linear estimation, is set at $148,000. This target is derived from calculating 64% of the price difference between points A and B. In contrast, the more aggressive logarithmic target suggests that Bitcoin could reach as high as $244,000.When asked about the possibility of Bitcoin hitting $130,000 this week, the analyst stated that it is possible, as the market is likely on the cusp of a parabolic move.Bitcoin's Strong Buying PressureMeanwhile, data on Bitcoin holder inflows reveals strong buying pressure in both the short and long term. The 7-day change in inflows has increased by 168.70%, indicating heightened short-term demand. Bitcoin Large Holders Inflow Bitcoin Large Holders Inflow | IntoTheBlock More notably, the 30-day change has surged by 522.76%, suggesting that large holders have been accumulating Bitcoin over the past month. However, despite the strong inflow data, the 90-day change in inflows shows a massive decline of 95.04%. Bitcoin’s Potential for Long-Term GrowthOn the macro scale, Bitcoin's potential for future growth has drawn attention from prominent analysts. Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat, remains confident that Bitcoin could reach an all-time high of $250,000 by the end of 2025.He attributes this optimistic outlook to Bitcoin's fixed supply—95% of its maximum supply has already been mined—combined with the growing imbalance between Bitcoin's demand and available supply. Lee speculates that more institutional and retail investors will enter the market, pushing Bitcoin’s price higher as demand continues to outpace its available supply.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/10/if-bitcoin-closes-above-this-level-it-confirms-its-inverted-ascending-scallop-targeting-244k/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=if-bitcoin-closes-above-this-level-it-confirms-its-inverted-ascending-scallop-targeting-244k,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH","Market|Bitcoin Price Prediction|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today",cryptocompare
2025-06-10T09:37:20,"Arthur Hayes predicts a new breakout for Hyperliquid (HYPE)","Hyperliquid (HYPE) fulfilled the expectations of rallying, as it reached a new peak for 2025. Crypto influencer Arthur Hayes predicts an even larger breakout for the DEX token. Hyperliquid (HYPE) is trending again, as its native token rallied to a new peak for 2025. The breakout happens just a day after whales accumulation was noticed, as Hyperliquid continues to draw attention and new traders. Arthur Hayes, crypto influencer and the co-founder of BitMex, expects a rally above $40 with the unpredictability of price discovery. HYPE reached $39.18, adding over 10% for the past day, after a period of almost non-stop recovery since the lows of $12 in April. Traders are already putting higher targets on HYPE, due to the long period of preparation and accumulation. HYPE broke out as trading volumes increased over 137% in the past day, up to $1.7B. The HYPE rally liquidated $1.44M in short positions. HYPE rallied above $39, expecting an even bigger breakout on increased DEX activity and signs of whales accumulation. | Source: CoinGecko Currently, HYPE long and short positions are nearly equally balanced, with some drift toward more shorting, as HYPE may backtrack to a lower range in the short term. HYPE remains unpredictable as it shifts toward a new price range. Traders are split between an irrational rally similar to meme tokens, and an opportunity to short an over-valued asset. HYPE is still trading neutral, not showing signs of being overbought. The asset is not even among the hottest trending crypto, leading to predictions for a more gradual and extended rally. Attempts at short liquidation may also lead to more near-vertical gains in a short time span. Hyperliquid brought out HYPE whales HYPE remains risky as 71.91% of trades are on-chain, locked in the native Hyperliquid ecosystem. The concentrated liquidity has brought out aggressive whales, who have engaged with token during previous rallies. A whale deposited $9.975M $USDC into #HyperLiquid and bought 259,367 $HYPE at a price of $38.46. Previously, the whale has made over $10M in $HYPE trades. https://t.co/iKAuQmwO0d pic.twitter.com/VkKsVWaQgg — Onchain Lens (@OnchainLens) June 10, 2025 Whales are also coming from external ecosystems, even using Solana’s Kamino Lend to borrow USDC and deposit it to Hyperliquid. HYPE was bought near its peak price in the past 24 hours, and some of the whales staked the tokens, easing the potential selling pressure. The current Hyperliquid activity may repeat the peak statistics of May, with record volumes and over $70M in generated fees. However, in the past weeks, liquidations slowed down as traders became more strategic. Hyperliquid remains one of the few exchanges to offer up to 40X leverage for BTC. Most of the open interest on Hyperliquid is still for BTC and ETH. However, trading other tokens is accelerating, including the native token. The DEX currently holds $558M in liquidity locked, expecting more significant expansion to compete with older DEXs and even centralized markets. Some of the engagement with HYPE may be organic, due to the ability to tap into the new BTC bullish trend. However, there are also rumors of an eventual second airdrop, which may drive additional activity and social media posting. An additional source of interest came from the trade moves of James Wynn with high-value positions which were publicly liquidated. Recently, Wynn stated he is back on Hyperliquid with an unknown account, continuing his strategy of longing BTC with high leverage.

2025-06-10T09:31:07,"Bitcoin Pepe price outlook as Nasdaq-listed firm plans major crypto acquisition","Bitcoin surged more than 3.6% in the past 24 hours to $109,232 as of June 10, buoyed by renewed risk appetite tied to optimism surrounding the US-China trade talks currently underway in London. The ongoing negotiations, focused on easing tariff measures, have rekindled hopes of a breakthrough between the world’s two largest economies. A positive resolution would mark another de-escalation in a trade conflict that has roiled markets since early 2025. Historically, such progress has triggered a shift into risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin’s rally comes after its breakout to all-time highs in May, following the announcement of a 90-day tariff pause between the US and China. That agreement had provided the first real signs of diplomatic traction and acted as a tailwind for both equities and digital assets. With Bitcoin pushing toward new highs amid improving macro conditions, retail investors are increasingly turning to speculative tokens like Bitcoin Pepe , which is now approaching the final stretch of its presale. Momentum-driven capital is rotating into early-stage projects as traders hunt for assets with asymmetric upside potential. This appetite for risk is being fueled by a broader crypto rebound, underpinned by institutional flows and easing macroeconomic headwinds. Corporations continue plans to accumulate BTC Siebert Financial Corp., a Nasdaq-listed financial services firm, announced on Monday that the US Securities and Exchange Commission has declared its S-3 shelf registration statement effective, allowing the company to raise up to $100 million for investments in crypto assets, artificial intelligence, and potential acquisitions. According to the company’s statement, proceeds from the offering will support a range of strategic initiatives, including the purchase of digital assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, as well as investments in AI-powered technologies and services. The S-3 filing enables Siebert to offer a mix of securities over time, up to the $100 million threshold. While no specific offering details were announced, the company signaled a clear intent to build exposure to digital assets and modernize its technological capabilities. Siebert joins a growing list of public firms expanding their Bitcoin treasuries. On Monday, Michael Saylor-led Strategy disclosed it had acquired another 1,045 BTC for approximately $110.2 million, lifting its total holdings to 582,000 BTC. Elsewhere, K33, Trump Media, and GameStop have recently announced plans to bolster their crypto reserves. In Japan, Metaplanet last week launched a $5.4 billion equity raise to fund additional Bitcoin purchases. BTC’s adoption may help Bitcoin Pepe’s rise With Bitcoin eyeing new highs amid rising institutional adoption, a foundation is being laid for broader market momentum. In this increasingly risk-friendly environment, investors with higher risk tolerance are rotating back into speculative and early-stage projects that carry the potential for outsized returns. Positioned at the intersection of meme culture and Bitcoin infrastructure, Bitcoin Pepe has gained traction as a standout bet among retail participants chasing high-reward plays. As the first meme-focused Layer 2 built on Bitcoin, Bitcoin Pepe aims to combine the blockchain’s core security with the scalability typically associated with Solana-style architectures. With over $14 million raised in its ongoing presale, Bitcoin Pepe is drawing significant investor interest amid a broader shift toward early-stage, high-upside tokens. To strengthen its ecosystem, Bitcoin Pepe has also secured partnerships with various projects, including Super Meme, GemuPlay, Catamoto, and Plena Finance. With a listing announcement scheduled for June 17, the project continues to position itself as a notable player in the cryptocurrency market.

2025-06-10T09:30:29,"Solana Triangle Formation Breakout Targets Rally To $164 – Is A Recovery Around The Corner?","Solana (SOL) has recovered from the recent market pullback after bouncing from its local bottom. Amid its recent breakout from a bullish formation, some market watchers suggest that the cryptocurrency could recover its start-of-year glory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly Chart Flexes Strength—Is The Moonshot Just Getting Started? Solana Breakout Eyes $164 Solana is recording a 2.45% surge in the weekly timeframe after recovering from its recent drop to the $140 area. The altcoin has seen a significant recovery from its multi-month downtrend, which led the token to hit a 14-month low of $95 during the early April retraces. However, SOL lost the $160 area amid the recent market corrections, dipping 11% in one week. Over the weekend, its price bounced nearly 10%, reclaiming the $150 level as support and forming an ascending triangle pattern. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted the 3-day formation in Solana’s chart, suggesting a potential 6% jump to its recently lost support level. According to the post, the cryptocurrency broke out of the triangle formation on Monday after reclaiming the $155 area. A retest and breakout confirmation could propel Solana to the $164 barrier, which has not been seen in two weeks. Analyst CW noted that if SOL breaks through the selling barrier around the $160 level, “the previous price will recover quickly,” as reclaiming this level could send the price straight to the $180 area. Notably, the altcoin’s next significant selling wall is around the $180 resistance, which it has been unable to reclaim despite touching a $187 three-month high during the recent market rally. Recovering this key barrier could also push SOL’s price toward the $200 mark, enabling a rally to new highs. However, failing to hold the current levels could send the cryptocurrency’s price back toward the $142 buying wall, which served as support last week, or even the $135 level, where the next buy wall sits. SOL Preparing To Climb Higher? Market watcher Jeremy pointed out that Solana is “finally breaking out from this downtrend consolidation.” Per the post, the cryptocurrency has been consolidating in a descending channel since late May, hovering between the $140-$187 price range. Throughout this period, SOL’s price moved from the $180 mark toward the $144 support. Nonetheless, it broke out of the two-week descending channel after reclaiming the $155 level. Jeremy suggested that Solana’s price could “actually climb higher” if global conflicts and political disputes, like the Trump-Musk online feud, don’t continue to affect the market, concluding that “1 SOL = $300 is just a matter of time.” Related Reading: Pundit Says Do Not Ignore Ethereum Amid New All-Time Highs In Major Metric Meanwhile, crypto trader Coinvo recently affirmed that SOL’s bottom “is finally in,” highlighting a potential bullish megaphone pattern in SOL’s chart. The 18-month pattern shows that the fourth wave bounced from the formation’s lower boundary during the April pullback. This could signal a potential surge to the upper boundary, around the all-time high (ATH) levels, during the fifth wave. A breakout above the pattern’s resistance line could propel Solana to new highs As of this writing, Solana trades at $156, a 1.88% increase in the daily timeframe.

This surge comes as key officials from the United States and China prepare for critical trade negotiations in London, aimed at addressing ongoing tensions and salvaging “a fragile trade agreement.” US-China Trade Talks Spark Investor Optimism The cryptocurrency gained 2% on Monday, briefly touching a peak of $108,900 before settling back slightly. This uptick reflects growing investor optimism regarding the potential resolution of trade disputes between the US and China, one of its largest trading partners. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and China’s Vice Premier for Economic Policy, He Lifeng, are set to lead their respective delegations in discussions that began Monday and are expected to continue into Tuesday, as reported by Fortune. Related Reading: Pundit Says Do Not Ignore Ethereum Amid New All-Time Highs In Major Metric These negotiations are part of President Donald Trump’s broader strategy to compel US trading partners to meet various demands, often through the threat of imposing significant tariffs on imports. Following the announcement of a sweeping tariff policy in April, which impacted nearly all American trading partners, Trump authorized a 90-day pause for negotiations. However, this pause did not apply to tariffs on China, which were escalated to 145%. Trade Talks Resuming As Bitcoin Prices Rise The heightened tensions between the two nations had previously led to a significant drop in Bitcoin’s value, reaching a yearly low of $75,000 as fears of a trade war drove investors away from American markets. However, optimism returned following a summit in Geneva last month, where Trump announced a temporary agreement that would lower tariffs and facilitate further discussions. In the wake of this news, Bitcoin surged to an all-time high of $111,800 on May 22. Yet, the truce was short-lived. Trump claimed that China had violated the agreement over a dispute regarding exports of rare earth magnets. On May 30, he expressed his frustrations on Truth Social, stating, “China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!” In an urgent attempt to salvage the deteriorating trade deal, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping held a phone call last week, their first in months. Following this 90-minute conversation, it was announced that senior officials from both countries would meet in London this week to resume negotiations. In addition to trade-related factors, Bitcoin’s recent price surge may also be influenced by increased activity in the cryptocurrency initial public offering (IPO) market. Wave Of Crypto IPO Activity Last week, the stablecoin giant Circle made its public debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), with its shares soaring by over 168%, jumping from an initial price of $31 to $69 on the first day of trading. Additionally, Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins, filed for an initial public offering, further demonstrating the crypto industry’s growing connection to traditional finance. Related Reading: Dogecoin Is Going To $1 With The ‘Next Impulse’, Analyst Predicts “While the IPO excitement may be short-lived, the long-term positioning of institutional investors suggests a bullish outlook for Bitcoin’s performance through 2025,” remarked David Siemer, CEO of Wave Digital Assets, in an interview with Fortune. When writing, BTC trades at $108,670, recording gains of 6% in the monthly time frame, little over 2.7% from its record high of $111,8000 reached in May.

2025-06-10T09:24:04,"SEC Chair Atkins Backs Self Custody of Bitcoin and Crypto as “Foundational American Value’","At a roundtable event in Washington, D.C., SEC Chairman Paul Atkins delivered a strong message on regulating digital assets, particularly supporting self-custody of Bitcoin and other crypto. He called self-custody a ""foundational American value"" and criticized the prior administration’s approach toward crypto asset regulation. Atkins stressed that the SEC’s previous stance involving legal actions targeting self-custodial technologies had hindered innovation within the crypto space.He argued that the SEC under Gary Gensler had overstepped by suggesting that developers of such technologies could be conducting brokerage activities. He pointed out that these technologies, which empower individuals to manage their assets without intermediaries, align with core free market principles.SEC’s Shift on Digital Asset RegulationThe SEC Chairman also noted the need for congressional approval to enforce any lasting policies on staking-as-a-service providers. He emphasized the importance of ensuring that these policies are grounded in legislative authority rather than the agency’s interpretation alone. Meanwhile, Atkins voiced his support for flexible market structures that allow participants to self-custody their assets, particularly when intermediaries impose unnecessary transaction costs or limit the ability to engage in activities like staking.Clarification on Staking and Self-CustodyRecall, the SEC has recently moved to ease its approach toward staking in proof-of-stake (PoS) networks. The Division of Corporation Finance clarified on May 29 that specific staking activities do not fall under the scope of federal securities laws. This guidance exempts activities like self-staking by node operators and self-custodial staking through third-party services from registration requirements. Atkins also praised the agency’s current stance, stating that voluntary participation in proof-of-work or proof-of-stake networks, such as mining or staking, is not subject to federal securities laws. However, he acknowledged that this clarification is not yet a formal rule with the force of law, suggesting that the SEC must continue refining its approach.SEC’s Ongoing Actions In addition to these comments, the SEC has made significant moves regarding its legal battles with major exchanges. Recently, the agency filed a joint stipulation with firms like Coinbase and Binance to dismiss the civil enforcement action against the platform. This aligns with the SEC’s broader efforts to establish a more transparent regulatory framework for digital assets. Notably, the SEC also dropped its efforts to classify ten cryptocurrencies, including Solana and Cardano, as securities in the Binance lawsuit.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/10/sec-chair-atkins-backs-self-custody-of-bitcoin-and-crypto-as-foundational-american-value/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=sec-chair-atkins-backs-self-custody-of-bitcoin-and-crypto-as-foundational-american-value,"BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|BNB","Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today",cryptocompare

2025-06-10T09:23:26,"Strategy Shifts Capital Raise to Preferred Stocks as Common Share Issuance Loses Allure","Disclaimer: The analyst who wrote this piece owns shares of Strategy (MSTR). Over the past two weeks, Strategy (MSTR) has refrained from utilizing the at-the-market (ATM) equity program on its common shares to fund bitcoin BTC purchases, choosing instead to use the programs on its two perpetual preferred stocks. The choice most likely reflects the narrowing premium between the company's share price and its multiple net asset value (mNAV) or, more colloquially, the difference between its market cap and the value of its bitcoin holdings, and allows Strategy to raise funds to buy more BTC without diluting shareholders' stakes in the company. When the share price trades close to the underlying bitcoin asset value, issuing common shares via ATM becomes less attractive. Such offerings are typically only advantageous when executed at a meaningful premium. Strategy funded its most recent 1,045 BTC purchase using proceeds from its two perpetual preferred stock ATMs: 59.18% from the STRK offering and 40.82% from the STRF one. These preferred stocks have demonstrated strong lifetime returns of 35% for STRK and 24% for STRF. This gives the company greater flexibility to continue accumulating bitcoin while preserving upside for common stock investors. There's also an additional dynamic at play, according to analyst Jeff Walton . The effective dividend yields of STRK and STRF have steadily declined from about 10% even though the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury has remained relatively constant at 4.5%. That's because the dividend yield falls as the price of the stock increases, a bond-like behavior that makes the preferred shares more attractive in a stable rate environment. Strategy is likely to reengage the ATM on its common stock if the share price rises significantly, particularly if it exceeds twice the mNAV, which would allow room for dilutive issuance at a premium. While the common stock ATM remains the primary mechanism to fund dividend obligations on the preferred shares, Strategy retains the option to use the preferred stock ATMs for this purpose as well, depending on market conditions.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/10/strategy-shifts-capital-raise-to-preferred-stocks-as-common-share-issuance-loses-allure,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|STRK","Markets|Bitcoin|MicroStrategy|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-10T09:20:43,"Canary Capital Moves Toward Potential Injective-Based ETF in the US","Canary Capital has taken its first official step toward launching a U.S.-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) centered on the Injective (INJ) token. A trust named “Canary Staked INJ ETF” was registered on June 10 with the Delaware Division of Corporations, a typical early move for firms looking to eventually list an ETF tied to a digital asset. While the creation of a Delaware trust does not guarantee an ETF launch, it is often the first step before firms file for regulatory approval with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Several recent crypto ETF launches have followed this path, including products tracking Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other blockchain tokens. There are no public details yet on the structure of the INJ ETF, but the move follows Canary Capital’s earlier filing in April for an ETF involving Tron (TRX) , which aimed to generate yield by staking the token. That structure would allow the fund to earn staking rewards while holding and locking a portion of the asset to help secure the blockchain. INJ Token Sees Boost Amid ETF Speculation News of the Delaware trust helped push the price of the INJ token up 3.7% in the last 24 hours, adding to a more than 10.5% gain over the past week. The token’s rally comes alongside a modest increase in user activity and transactions on the Injective blockchain, according to data from DappRadar. The Injective network positions itself as a layer-1 blockchain optimized for artificial intelligence agents and the tokenization of real-world assets, including traditional stocks. These sectors are gaining interest as the crypto industry continues to seek practical applications that go beyond speculative trading. Asset manager 21Shares has already launched a similar product in Europe, offering an exchange-traded product (ETP) that tracks INJ and incorporates staking rewards. Canary Capital’s move appears aimed at bringing a comparable product to U.S. markets. Regulatory Hurdles Remain for Staking-Based ETFs Despite growing interest, the SEC remains cautious about ETFs tied to staked cryptocurrencies . Last month, the regulator expressed concerns about similar proposals from REX Financial and Osprey Funds, suggesting they may not meet the legal criteria required to qualify as investment companies. Still, optimism remains. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas noted that REX’s legal team believes the issue can be resolved, hinting that staking ETFs could eventually gain approval if structured properly. Canary Capital has not yet responded to requests for comment on its INJ trust filing.

2025-06-10T09:15:02,"Stock Market Pullback in Sight As Several of America’s Problems Still Remain, Warns Former JPMorgan Strategist","The former chief market strategist at JPMorgan, Marko Kolanovic, is offering his outlook on the US stock market in his first interview since leaving the trillion-dollar bank. In a CNBC interview, Kolanovic says a correction could be incoming for the US stock market amid a loss of momentum by stocks such as the electric carmaker Tesla and the analytics software firm Palantir Technologies. The analyst also warns that the equities are trading close to record high levels, but America is still staring at the same issues that triggered a stock market correction earlier this year. “That [loss of momentum] could be a catalyst for a bit of a correction because close to all-time highs, but we still have all the problems. We have a trade war, we had a sort of signs of economic slowdown, valuations are back to highs. So that’s sort of what I’m kind of expecting – a little bit of a pullback here.” Kolanovic believes that a potential pullback could ultimately reward patient investors, provided the likelihood of a US economic contraction does not significantly increase. “There are some cheap aspects of US markets as well, and maybe wait for that garden variety sell-off that can be maybe 5%, 10%. And if we still don’t have the recession probability shooting up, then it’s a buy opportunity. But I would keep an open mind that maybe at that point there is increased probability of recession and maybe even that 5% is not a buy at that [point].” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-10T09:10:54,"Crypto analyst predicts a new all-time high for Bitcoin","Bitcoin ( BTC ) has surged past the $110,000 mark following a critical breakout above $108,900, positioning itself for a potential new all-time high of $130,000. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe predicted on June 10 that the current phase is likely a short consolidation period, a common pattern before increased upward momentum. The ideal buying range as BTC prepares for what could be another historic run, van de Poppe suggests, sits around $107,000 to $108,000. Bitcoin’s 14-day relative strength index ( RSI ) currently sits at 6771, which is bullish but not yet overheated. Michaël van de Poppe’s BTC analysis. Source: X If the RSI retests 75 by the end of the month, another analyst PlanB suggests, the June closing price for BTC would be ~$130,000, agreeing with van de Poppe’s predictions. Bitcoin price forecast The rally can apparently be chalked up to a number of reasons, most notably a sharp technical breakout. Namely, BTC reclaimed the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $109,248 after bouncing off key support near $100,436. Institutional demand likewise remains strong, with spot exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) and corporate treasuries continuing to absorb supply. Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) (NASDAQ: MSTR ), for example, has bought over 1000 BTC this week, worth ~$110.2 million in total. Moreover, many investors are optimistic about the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decision on Federal Funds Rate (FED) cuts, pending June 18. While prolonged high rates might weigh on risk assets, BTC’s correlation with global liquidity could provide some much needed counterbalance. All in all, with strong institutional inflows, bullish investor sentiment, and solid technical signals, a big move might very well be on the horizon. Whether that will include the $130,000 target, however, remains to be seen.

2025-06-10T09:06:54,"Interview: Crypto now a ‘strategic asset,’ not a ‘speculative play,’ says BlockTrust CEO Jonathan Rose amidst IRA surge","As cryptocurrencies continue to mature as an asset class, more investors are exploring ways to integrate them into long-term financial planning—particularly through retirement accounts. Many investors are turning to crypto IRAs as a way to combine the tax benefits of retirement accounts with the growth potential and diversification offered by digital assets. However, the approach isn’t without risk. Cryptocurrency’s inherent volatility can significantly affect portfolio values, which is especially concerning for those nearing retirement, who may not have time to recover from sharp market downturns. To understand how this evolving landscape is shaping investor behaviour, Invezz spoke with Jonathan Rose, CEO of BlockTrust IRA, a platform that helps investors build diversified, crypto-inclusive retirement portfolios through AI-powered managed accounts and self-directed IRAs. The platform has onboarded nearly $50 million in managed IRAs since the launch of its Managed Crypto IRA 3 months ago, apart from the user base of investors who wish to self-manage on the BlockTrust platform due to our industry low trading fees, Rose shared, adding that the average IRA transfer or 401k rollover is around $50,000. Rose is confident BlockTrust will reach its $100 million AUM target by year-end, citing strong demand, a streamlined onboarding process, and increasing referrals. He also drew a clear distinction between crypto IRAs and spot Bitcoin ETFs. Rose adds: ETFs are passive, one-size-fits-all products. We offer an actively managed, tax-advantaged way to capture the upside of a digital asset boom and mitigate downside risk. Excerpts from an emailed interaction: A ‘major shift’ in retirement thinking Invezz : What trends are you seeing in investor demand for crypto in retirement accounts today? We’re seeing a major shift in how Americans think about retirement investing. More investors are realizing that traditional portfolios aren’t enough to keep pace with inflation, global instability, or tech disruption. Crypto is no longer just a speculative play; it’s becoming a strategic asset. At BlockTrust, we’ve seen significant growth in IRA rollovers from people who want exposure to digital assets but also want a managed, secure, and tax-advantaged way to do it. Volatility: a feature, not a bug Invezz : You’ve stated that BlockTrust embraces crypto market volatility to generate returns. How does your quantitative trading strategy mitigate the inherent risks of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum? Volatility is often seen as a downside in crypto. For us, it’s an opportunity. Our AI-driven trading algorithm is designed to thrive in dynamic markets by identifying trends and capitalizing on momentum shifts across Bitcoin and Ethereum. We don’t just hold Bitcoin and hope it goes up. We use data and cutting-edge technology to actively manage positions, hedge against downside, and protect capital. Risk isn’t eliminated; however we help our clients navigate that risk in a strategic way. A political tailwind from Washington Invezz : Recent developments, such as the passage of the Carey Bill in April, are gradually solidifying the promise of a crypto-friendly regulatory environment under President Donald Trump. How do you see such policies shaping the adoption of crypto IRAs in the coming years? The Carey Bill is a major milestone, signalling that Washington is finally getting serious about integrating digital assets into the mainstream financial system. This shift should lower the perceived risk, encourage adoption, and empower everyday Americans to diversify with confidence. We expect this policy momentum to further accelerate the growth of self-directed crypto retirement accounts. By the numbers: on pace for $100 million Invezz: Can you share any numbers on BlockTrust IRA’s growth—AUM, user demographics, or average portfolio size? Are you confident of hitting $100M in assets by the end of this year as projected? Since the launch of our Managed Crypto IRA just 3 months ago, we have onboarded nearly $50 million in the managed IRAs alone, not to mention users who wish to self-manage on the BlockTrust platform due to our industry low trading fees. The average IRA transfer or 401k rollover is around $50,000. Our average client is at or approaching retirement age and, for many, this is their first venture into the Cryptocurrency space. That being said, we have clients of all ages, including international clients who use our services for non-IRA investments. Based on our current momentum, we are on track to hit our $100 million AUM target by the end of the year. Demand is strong, the onboarding process is simple, and we’re scaling quickly thanks to both client referrals and favourable market conditions. Beyond the Bitcoin ETF: the case for active management Invezz : How do you view the growing popularity of spot Bitcoin ETFs? Do they complement or compete with BlockTrust’s crypto IRA offerings? Generally speaking, we view spot Bitcoin ETFs as complementary. They help legitimize the asset class, bring in institutional flows, and raise awareness, therefore benefitting everyone in the space. However from a client’s perspective it is critical to understand the fundamental differences between ETFs and what we offer at BlockTrust. ETFs are passive, one-size-fits-all products. We offer an actively managed, tax-advantaged way to capture the upside of a digital asset boom and mitigate downside risk. Our clients want more than just exposure to Bitcoin. They want a legitimate strategy. That being said, ultimately any developments that offer increased exposure to cryptocurrencies should be beneficial to our continued growth The post Interview: Crypto now a 'strategic asset,' not a 'speculative play,' says BlockTrust CEO Jonathan Rose amidst IRA surge appeared first on Invezz",invezz,https://invezz.com/news/2025/06/10/interview-crypto-now-a-strategic-asset-not-a-speculative-play-says-blocktrust-ceo-jonathan-rose-amidst-ira-surge/,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Crypto|Crypto business|Economic|North America|Pensions|Personal Finance|Bitcoin|Ethereum|USA",cryptocompare

The shares, sold on June 9 over the Nasdaq and other open markets, fetched a weighted average price of about $0.90 per share and reduced Riot's beneficial ownership to 14.3%, the company said . The hostile takeover bid became public in May 2024, with Riot offering to buy Bitfarms for $2.30 per share, an approach that was swiftly rejected and abandoned the following month. Riot continued to buy its rival's shares to exert pressure on the board to engage with the miner. Bitfarms subsequently implemented a shareholder rights plan or ""poison pill"" to deter Riot from buying the company. Riot emphasized that it remains committed to evaluating its position in Bitfarms based on a number of evolving factors. These include potential discussions with Bitfarms’ management, the company’s strategic trajectory, and broader market conditions. Riot said it may increase or decrease its holdings in the future depending on such considerations. Bitfarms stock rose 4% in pre-market trading to $0.96. Riot rose 0.49% to $10.17.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/06/10/riot-sells-usd1-58m-of-bitfarms-shares-as-part-of-investment-review,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Finance|RIOT|Bitcoin|Bitfarms|Shareholders|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-10T08:54:08,"Is the XRP Headed for a Bull or Bear Market? Analysis Firm Shares Its Target and Areas to Watch","Cryptocurrency analysis firm MakroVision has drawn a promising picture in its latest technical analysis for XRP. In the company's assessment, it was argued that the structure formed despite the downward trend in recent weeks indicates a strong upside potential. According to the analysis, XRP formed a classic bull flag formation during the recent decline, which was broken to the upside yesterday. At the same time, the XRP price broke above a key technical level of $2.23, indicating that the bulls are back in control. According to the analytics company, XRP quickly recovered from the lower boundary of the downtrend channel. The downtrend broken during this recovery is giving signals of renewed strength in the market. The increasing upward momentum is a technical development in favor of the bulls. Related News: HOT MOMENTS: Bitcoin Soars - Surpasses $111,000 - All-Time High Price Record About to Be Broken MakroVision shared the key levels for XRP as follows: The $2.48 level stands out as a resistance point that has faced selling pressure many times in the past. $2.65 is the breakout level from May; exceeding this threshold could pave the way for a new uptrend in XRP. The reaction at $2.23 was strong; this level should be maintained. On the downside, the $2.03–$1.95 range (both the “Golden Pocket” and the horizontal support zone) is key to maintaining the medium-term trend. *This is not investment advice.
