2025-06-10T20:35:07,"Whales Are Withdrawing Bitcoin from Exchanges at Record Levels – What Does This Mean?","Cryptocurrency analysis firm Alphractal has published a remarkable assessment of Bitcoin. According to the analysis, the Bitcoin balance on cryptocurrency exchanges has decreased by 3.77 million BTC since February 2020. This means that approximately $219 billion worth of Bitcoin has been withdrawn from exchanges. Although this major movement may seem like a sell-off at first glance, according to Alphractal, the opposite is true: This rise is a strong indicator of growing confidence and maturity in the market. Alphractal noted that investors have no intention of selling their Bitcoin by moving it to personal wallets, but rather see the digital asset as a long-term store of value. According to analysts, this indicates that the “HODL” strategy is gaining strength. Related News: BREAKING: Rumors of Solana Spot ETF Approval Emerge, Could Stir Up the Market - Price Reacts With Bitcoin being pulled off exchanges, selling pressure is thought to have significantly decreased, creating a supply squeeze that could make it easier for prices to move upwards in the event of a potential demand increase. Alphractal sees this as a “very bullish signal.” As a result, Alphractal says that the 3.77 million BTC outflow from exchanges is not a sign of panic, but rather a strong belief in the future of Bitcoin. This development shows that Bitcoin is increasingly being adopted as “digital gold” by more and more people. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-10T20:32:17,"Bitcoin has stayed above $100,000 for 30 straight days, the longest stretch ever","Bitcoin just broke another record by staying above $100,000 for 30 days in a row, the first time that’s ever happened since the cryptocurrency was created. This streak started after its last dip below six figures on May 8, and not once since then has it closed under that level. The price pulled back from its May 22 all-time high of $112,000, dropping to $100,428 by Friday, but heavy weekend buying pushed it back to $105,000. By Monday, it had surged again to $110,000, with traders responding to renewed optimism around US-China trade discussions. The fact that it hasn’t broken below $100K for a full month has crypto traders calling it a key milestone—even if some still see it more as a psychological checkpoint than a technical win. Still, it’s a major line that held strong, and analysts are watching closely to see what’s next. Traders defend $100K on pullbacks Read Harvey, a technical analyst at Wolfe Research, told CNBC the move above $100K wasn’t just about hype. “What really stood out to us was price’s ability to hold that level on the back test, when it briefly fell to $100,000 on Thursday. It also happened to align perfectly with the 50-day moving average,” Read said. He added that he sees the current setup as a launchpad toward the previous high of $112,000. Read also expects Bitcoin to spend a bit more time consolidating around its current level before any breakout to new highs, saying a temporary pause is normal after such a run. While short-term traders are focused on charts and averages, others are looking at the bigger picture. Ben Kurland, CEO of crypto analytics platform DYOR, said this $100,000 level is no longer just about market emotion. “$100,000 isn’t just speculative froth now,” Ben said. “It’s a new floor being tested and held by institutional flows, ETF inflows , and a maturing investor base.” He added that the pattern of short-lived pumps followed by sharp retracements is starting to fade. Ben believes this consolidation is healthy and sets up Bitcoin for the next move. “If $100,000 is the new base,” he said, “then $120,000-$130,000 becomes the next logical zone—especially as macro conditions stabilize and sidelined capital seeks asymmetric upside.” Long-term holders sell, ETFs keep buying While institutions and funds continue to buy, some older holders are starting to cash in. Tyrone Ross, founder and president of advisory firm 401 Financial, said the 30-day stretch above $100K might not be a massive technical feat, but it still matters. “On-chain data shows long-term holders are selling,” Tyrone said. He explained that while demand from ETFs and companies remains strong, retail investors haven’t returned in full force yet. But if Bitcoin keeps holding these levels, he said, retail interest is likely to come back in waves. Tyrone pointed out that May 27 saw a big shift. At that point, when Bitcoin was around $109,000, spending by long-term holders—people who’ve held for at least six months—shot up to around 40,000 Bitcoin, according to CryptoQuant. That’s since dropped all the way down to about 6,000 as of Monday. Over the same stretch, overall 30-day demand has fallen too, from 228,000 Bitcoin down to 126,000. That slowdown might cool the pace of price growth in the short term, according to Julio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant. Still, Bitcoin keeps pushing. On Tuesday, it was trading at roughly $108,800, about 3% below its peak. Earlier that same day, it climbed to $110,500, its highest point since the May 22 record. With this current streak still intact, everyone’s watching to see if $100K becomes more than just a floor—whether it becomes the new normal.

2025-06-10T20:02:08,"BOJ June Meeting Could Trigger Major Moves in Stocks and Crypto – What to Watch","The Bank of Japan’s upcoming monetary policy meeting, scheduled for June 16–17, is drawing intense global attention, and for good reason. As speculation builds, analysts say the central bank’s next move could spark a major shift across risk markets, from Japanese equities to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. BOJ Meeting: Arthur Hayes Predicts Bitcoin Boom if QE Returns Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX and CIO of Maelstrom, believes the BOJ could soon shift back to quantitative easing (QE), a move that would inject liquidity into the economy and lift risk assets. “If the BOJ delays QT, and restarts selected QE at its June meeting, risk assets are going to fly,” Hayes posted on X on June 10. I don’t think ordinary Japanese plebes would agree. If the BOJ delays QT, and restarts selected QE at its June meeting risk assets are going to fly. LFG $BTC pic.twitter.com/ET08M6tWeS — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) June 10, 2025 QE, short for quantitative easing, refers to central bank bond purchases designed to keep interest rates low and stimulate economic activity. A shift in this direction could serve as a tailwind for crypto and stock markets, both of which are closely watching Japan’s policy decisions amid rising global volatility. According to a report from Bloomberg, the central bank is expected to slow the pace of its quantitative tightening (QT). Since last summer, the BOJ has been reducing its government bond purchases by ¥400 billion ($2.8 billion) per quarter. But that pace may soon be halved. “The pace of reduction is likely to be eased to around ¥200 billion per quarter,” said Eiji Maeda, a former BOJ executive director and current president of Chibagin Research Institute. “They won’t keep going with ¥400 billion.” Governor Kazuo Ueda’s board is also set to review the existing bond-buying program through 2026 and beyond. Maeda added that once monthly bond purchases reach around ¥2 trillion by early 2027, further reductions will likely pause. Although the BOJ is widely expected to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.5% next week, the broader market focus is now on how far and how fast it will scale back its bond purchases. Japan’s inflation has been above the 2% target for three straight years, the highest among G7 nations, fanning expectations that a shift toward more easing could still be on the table. Still, uncertainties around U.S. tariffs and a recent GDP contraction complicate the timing of further rate hikes. “The BOJ must be careful,” Maeda warned. “They shouldn’t rush for normalization when these thick, dark clouds are hanging over the economy.” Bitcoin’s Price Action and BoJ Policy Shift Could Set Stage for New Bull Cycle As investors brace for the BOJ’s June 16 meeting, market focus is intensifying on how policy changes could ripple across global assets, including crypto. The BOJ’s announcement last July to reduce government bond purchases by ¥400 billion per quarter marked a major step toward quantitative tightening. With an interim assessment now due, insiders suggest the central bank may consider a gentler path, cutting purchases by only ¥200 billion per quarter starting in April 2027. Such a shift could indicate a longer-term dovish tilt, potentially spurring capital flows into risk assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin has responded to Japan’s tightening moves before. For example, on May 22, just two days after Japan’s 30-year bond yield hit a record 3.185%, BTC surged to a new all-time high of $112,000. While currently trading at $109,152, the flagship crypto maintains bullish momentum and strong technical support above $75,000. Source: Cryptonews.com . Price action is now consolidating within a descending triangle, a setup known to precede explosive breakouts. With volume stable and RSI neutral, all eyes are on a potential breakout before July 1. Bitcoin’s recent volatility has left traders torn between optimism and caution, as shifting global capital flows collide with conflicting technical signals. #Bitcoin #BTC https://t.co/ZcWeyewRad — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 10, 2025 If BTC decisively breaches the $110,000 resistance, analysts expect fresh highs toward $115,000–$118,000, igniting the next phase of the bull run.

Nazarov notes in a new YouTube video that the decentralized oracle network is arriving at a point where financial institutions have been reaching out for help with various projects. “At this point, I’ve been – between last year and this year so far – almost everywhere. Last year, we covered a lot of Asia, the Middle East, Australia, many of the top environments where cryptocurrencies and blockchains are getting adopted. This year, with the new stance on regulation in the US, we are very heavily covering all of the US institutions in addition to continuing to cover those in Asia and the Middle East. So I can’t mention exact names, because they want to wait to announce, they have all these processes with NDAs (non-disclosure agreements). It’s a very tightly controlled process, but I would say between last year and this year, we’re in various stages of conversations with probably all the top institutions in those geographies. I think that those top institutions basically want to use the solution that solves all their problems, is used by the other top-tier banks and players, has all the functionality they want, whether that’s identity, data connectivity, orchestration. And there’s really no system other than Chainlink that meets that high standard.” LINK is trading at $14.50 at time of writing.

2025-06-10T20:00:17,"Bitcoin ETFs Set to Reach $1 Trillion Trading Volume Milestone","Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States are nearly crossing the $1 trillion mark in total trading volume. This achievement comes just 17 months after their launch in January 2024. These crypto funds have quickly grown into one of the most active ETF products in the world. Reportedly, it rivaled long-established giants like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF and the Invesco Nasdaq-100 ETF. Bitcoin ETFs’ Early Growth Fueled by Market Momentum When Bitcoin ETFs first launched, interest was immediate and strong. In March 2024, they raked in $100 billion in total trading volume, which doubled when Bitcoin’s price hit nearly $74,000. However, this upward trading trend slowed, with Bitcoin’s price between $50,000 and $70,000. The ETFs continued to trade actively during this time, but without the same fast growth rate. Positive momentum returned to the market when Donald Trump won the presidential election in November 2024. This event helped Bitcoin break past its previous highs, and the ETFs quickly passed the $500 billion mark in cumulative trading volume. Bitcoin ETF Market Outlook In 2025, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to gain strong momentum, reaching $750 billion in trading volume in February 2025. As of June 9, 2025, the trading volume is at $995.2 billion, very close to the $1 trillion milestone. Bitcoin’s price is also nearly its latest all-time high of $112,000. According the time of writing, the flagship crypto has been trading at $109,055, up by 1,21% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. Impressively, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs are now among the biggest crypto funds in the world, with over $120 billion in assets. Most of this comes from top performer BlackRock’s IBIT , which holds $70 billion and handles 79% of the total trading volume. In contrast, Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETF, on the other hand, has lost $23 billion due to higher fees. Meanwhile, Ethereum spot ETFs have not seen the same level of success . Since launching in July 2024, it has raked in $83.4 billion in trading volume and holds $6.6 billion in assets. Ethereum spot ETFs’ net inflows are $3.4 billion, which is positive, but much smaller than Bitcoin ETFs. Investor Confidence Is Growing At first, many thought only asset managers would benefit from the Bitcoin ETF. However, Bitcoin ’s price rise, rising from $30,000 to over $110,000 since January 2024, shows that the whole market has gained. This growth has helped Bitcoin become a more trusted and mainstream investment, with institutional investors heavily investing in crypto investment funds and showing growing interest in Bitcoin.

2025-06-10T19:55:34,"Trader Predicts Parabolic Sui Rally to New Highs, Says Recent $223,000,000 DEX Hack Gave ‘Amazing Opportunity’","A widely followed crypto analyst says that layer-1 blockchain Sui ( SUI ) is gearing up for a massive breakout to fresh all-time highs. In a new thread, pseudonymous crypto trader Kaleo tells his 703,900 followers on the social media platform X that SUI is suddenly presenting a major buying opportunity. He says that the recent $223 million hack of the Cetus Protocol, a decentralized exchange (DEX) operating on the Sui network, caused SUI’s value to decline, but ultimately gave bulls a chance to position themselves for the next leg up. “Remember last cycle how many times SOL was declared dead because it went down? Every single time the FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) was bought, and it came back stronger. I think the recent CETUS exploit gave an amazing opportunity for a dip to stack more SUI. CETUS is officially back with a recovery plan for affected pools. There’s also a plan in place for token compensation for affected users. If anything, the CETUS issue makes me more bullish showing how SUI governance was swift to act together to stop the protocol’s exploit from being any worse and allowing the hacker to get away with the funds. Feel free to cope from the sidelines, but I’m as bullish as I’ve been since I partnered with SUI on them having the opportunity to fill the gap in the monolithic L1 (layer-1) race. Run it back turbo.” Source: Kaleo/X Based on his chart, the trader appears to suggest that SUI print a new all-time high at around $7.50, more than double its current value, perhaps sometime in September of this year. The analyst also says that SUI may be getting ready to breakout of a bullish descending wedge pattern against Bitcoin ( BTC ). “SUI/BTC ratio also looks solid with a clean breakout retest. I see this breaking out and filling the launch wick soon.” Source: Kaleo/X At time of writing, SUI is trading for $3.45.

2025-06-10T19:27:24,"SEC may approve Solana ETF in coming weeks: report","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission may approve a spot Solana exchange-traded fund within the next few months, according to multiple sources cited by Blockworks. The SEC has reportedly asked prospective Solana ( SOL ) ETF issuers to submit amended S-1 registration statements by next week. One source suggested an approval could arrive within three to five weeks. Two sources told Blockworks the agency will provide comments on the updated filings within 30 days. The changes focus on two key areas: how issuers plan to handle in-kind redemptions and whether staking will be incorporated into the ETF structure. Notably, the SEC is said to be open to allowing staking as part of these products. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart commented that approval could come as early as July, though the final deadlines for SEC decisions, based on the 240-day review period, extend to October. Seyffart said the agency may now be prioritizing 19b-4 filings related to Solana and staking ETFs sooner than originally expected. Several asset managers are lining up to offer a Solana ETF, including VanEck, Bitwise, Fidelity, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, Canary Capital, and 21Shares.

The SEC formally acknowledged Grayscale’s Solana ETF proposal in February, a significant shift given its past resistance to such filings. While the SEC delayed its decision on Grayscale’s Solana ETF in May, it stated it had not yet reached any conclusions. The delay was seen as procedural rather than a rejection. Market observers took that as a positive sign, particularly after CME launched SOL futures in February, mirroring steps taken ahead of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF approvals. CME’s launch of SOL futures has already led to the introduction of SOL futures ETFs, including two from Volatility Shares . Following the historic approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 and Ethereum ETFs in May 2025, attention has now turned to other top digital assets like Solana. The very existence of futures markets often paves the way for spot ETF approval, as seen with BTC and ETH.

Reaching this level would represent a 336% rally from XRP’s price of $2.29 as of press time. Indeed, the move will be massively bullish, considering that XRP has struggled to establish itself above the $2.30 resistance level despite. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Now, in a June 8 TradingView post , Persian Blockchain emphasized that the outcome of the ongoing lawsuit between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) remains one of the most significant catalysts for XRP’s future trajectory. With a court-imposed 60-day deadline approaching on June 16, speculation is growing that Ripple may secure a favorable ruling. Such an outcome could restore investor confidence and remove a long-standing obstacle to XRP’s upside potential. Notably, both parties are pushing for a settlement after an initial application was rejected due to procedural issues . On the macroeconomic front, the analyst pointed to a renewed expansion in global liquidity, as tracked by the M2 Global Liquidity Index. Rising liquidity has historically supported risk assets, particularly cryptocurrencies. XRP price levels to watch Technically, the trading expert noted that XRP appears well-positioned and is forming a bullish flag pattern, a continuation setup often preceding sharp upward moves. After months of consolidation within a downward-sloping channel, XRP looks ready to challenge key resistance levels. The analysis outlined several bullish Fibonacci extension targets, including $3.64, $4.47, $6.27, and a long-term target of $11.25, with the psychological $10 level firmly within range.

Investors should watch for a confirmed breakout followed by a retest, ideally bouncing from the accumulation zone, to validate the move. “A perfect storm of fundamentals and technical. A retest of the breakout area followed by bullish confirmation could signal the beginning of a larger move toward the $10 psychological level,” the analyst said. If XRP reaches the $10 mark, its market cap will surge to approximately $587 billion, potentially making it the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin ( BTC ), assuming Ethereum sees minimal growth over the same period.

While several key factors could be responsible for the recent upward move in BTC’s price, one factor seems to stand out the most among all. What’s Behind The Bitcoin Renewed Upswing Bitcoin has witnessed downside pressure since reaching a new all-time high in May this year. However, BTC’s price has recently made an electric comeback, rising above the crucial $105,000 level in a stunning display of power on Monday. Following the renewed upward performance by BTC, Glassnode, a leading financial and on-chain analytics platform, has underscored the major trigger behind the sharp rally. According to the on-chain platform, the sudden upswing is likely driven by a wave of short positions liquidations. Following weeks of ambiguity and price fluctuations that shook investor confidence, the flagship cryptocurrency has rekindled optimism among investors about further gains. As traders who bet against BTC’s upside potential were forced to cover their positions, a surge of buy orders swept over the market, which appears to have caused prices to spike higher. This abrupt action from Bitcoin not only highlights how erratic the asset may be but also suggests that the market mood may change as bulls or buyers gain ground. Furthermore, it marks a turning point in BTC’s path, increasing the potential for the flagship asset to reclaim its all-time high and even beyond. Data from the on-chain platform shows that the total short liquidations of the 24-hour Simple Moving Average (24H SMA) increased from $105,000 to $359,000 in just 4 hours. Prior to the upward move, Bitcoin’s funding rates turned negative, which pointed to a rise in short appetite. However, as of Monday, those short bets from investors were observed being squeezed. A Solid Cluster Of Liquidity Ahead For BTC In an X (formerly Twitter) post , Daan Crypto Trades, a technical expert and trader, has shed more light on Bitcoin’s recent liquidation heat map, particularly on the largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance. After examining the liquidation heat map on the monthly time frame, the expert highlighted that the chart’s narrative is consistent with other charts that show significant liquidity clusters aligning well with critical levels. Nonetheless, the expert believes that below the $100,000 mark and Thursday’s low are areas where things can pick up speed, and the current correction could occur. Meanwhile, above the $112,000 level and into new all-time highs is where Bitcoin’s price would find a strong cluster of liquidity from shorts that had amassed during this time. Also, Daan Crypto Trades noted that a lot of stops are likely to be placed above the point.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoins-stunning-rebound/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Bitcoin News|binance|bitcoin|bitcoin funding rates|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Daan Crypto Trades|Glassnode|Liquidation heatmap|Short Positions|Simple Moving Average|SMA",cryptocompare

Will his a16z and Kalshi ties raise red flags as the Senate reviews his nomination? Table of Contents Brian Quintenz faces Senate for CFTC chair role Quintenz’s career and blockchain expertise CFTC peers back Quintenz for chair role CFTC prepares for digital assets oversight Brian Quintenz faces Senate for CFTC chair role Brian Quintenz , President Donald Trump ’s nominee to chair the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, is scheduled to appear before the Senate on Jun. 10 as lawmakers assess his qualifications to lead an agency preparing for expanded oversight of cryptocurrency markets. The CFTC is currently operating with only two Senate-confirmed commissioners. Rostin Behnam stepped down in February, followed by the departures of Summer Mersinger and Christy Goldsmith Romero by May 31. Acting Chair Caroline Pham is also expected to exit once Quintenz is confirmed, leaving the agency at a pivotal moment with both leadership structure and regulatory direction in transition. Quintenz’s nomination has already drawn attention due to financial disclosures submitted on May 25. The filings reveal he holds $3.4 million in assets, including investments in multiple Andreessen Horowitz crypto funds — CNK Fund III, CNK Seed 1 Fund, and CNK IV Fund — as well as stock options in Kalshi , a prediction market platform where he serves on the board. Kalshi recently won a legal case against the CFTC in May 2025, securing permission to offer contracts tied to election outcomes. Since the CFTC regulates both crypto derivatives and prediction markets, ethics advocates have raised concerns over potential conflicts of interest. In a letter dated May 21 addressed to CFTC Ethics Official John Einstman, Quintenz pledged to divest from all relevant financial interests within 90 days of confirmation. He also committed to recusing himself from any CFTC matters involving Andreessen Horowitz for two years and Kalshi for one year. Critics contend that these measures may not fully resolve the conflict concerns. The upcoming Senate hearing is expected to examine those questions closely, weighing Quintenz’s industry background and prior CFTC experience against concerns around impartiality and long-term regulatory independence. Quintenz’s career and blockchain expertise Quintenz has built a career that spans traditional finance, public service, and blockchain policy, with each phase shaping his approach to regulation in evolving markets. Born in 1977, he studied economics at Duke University and began his professional life as a congressional aide. He later founded Saeculum Capital Management, a hedge fund focused on derivatives trading. His public service began in full when he was nominated to the CFTC under both the Obama and Trump administrations. The Senate unanimously confirmed him in August 2017, and he served as commissioner until 2021. During his tenure at the agency, he chaired the Technology Advisory Committee and oversaw several landmark developments, including the launch of the first regulated Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) futures contracts. He also helped initiate early policy discussions on decentralized finance and tokenized assets, consistently advocating for a risk-based oversight model that promotes innovation while upholding market integrity and investor protection. After stepping down from the CFTC in August 2021, Quintenz entered the private sector with a focus on crypto. He joined Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto division, initially as an advisory partner, and by December 2022, he became its global head of policy. At a16z Crypto, he worked on developing regulatory frameworks for blockchain platforms and helped guide portfolio companies such as Coinbase, Solana ( SOL ), and Maker ( MKR ) through engagement with policymakers. His role in the private sector also extended to prediction markets. In November 2021, he joined the board of Kalshi, a platform for trading outcomes of real-world events. He also served as an advisor to Crypto.com between 2021 and 2022. In a 2021 interview with Bloomberg, he described event-based markets as tools that allow people to price probabilities more transparently and push back against misinformation. His broader view of blockchain’s role in society became especially clear on Jun. 10. He described blockchain as a horizontal technology with potential applications beyond finance, including supply chains, governance systems, and digital identity infrastructure. He also called on Congress to provide legal clarity around token classifications and agency responsibilities, arguing that regulatory certainty is necessary both to protect consumers and to ensure the United States remains globally competitive in emerging technology. CFTC peers back Quintenz for chair role Reactions to Brian Quintenz’s nomination have revealed a clear divide. Supporters emphasize his experience and previous contributions to digital asset regulation, while critics continue to raise concerns about his industry ties and potential conflicts of interest. Caroline Pham, Acting Chair of the CFTC, publicly endorsed Quintenz’s return to the agency. In a LinkedIn post published on Feb. 12, she wrote, “I worked with Brian on important initiatives that he led to success as a CFTC commissioner. He will do the same for crypto and innovation.” Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, expressed similar support. In a post on X dated Dec. 12 last year, he called Quintenz “an amazing pick” potentially referring to his earlier role in crypto futures markets as evidence of forward-looking and informed regulatory thinking. Brian Quintenz would be an amazing pick for CFTC https://t.co/CiYdFZHedV — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) December 12, 2024 Former CFTC Chair Chris Giancarlo also weighed in on the day of the nomination. He stated that “Quintenz’s understanding of the Commodity Exchange Act and digital assets ensures he’ll craft regulations that foster innovation without compromising market integrity.” Criticism, however, has focused largely on Quintenz’s financial disclosures. Opponents continue to question his investments in Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto funds and his board position at Kalshi, particularly given the CFTC’s oversight of both crypto derivatives and prediction markets. CFTC prepares for digital assets oversight The CFTC is entering a crucial phase that could redefine its role in financial oversight, particularly in the area of digital assets. Traditionally focused on regulating derivatives markets, the agency has overseen Bitcoin and Ethereum futures since 2017 but has had a limited role in spot crypto markets. Its involvement in that space has been largely confined to cases involving fraud or manipulation. That boundary may be shifting. During President Donald Trump’s second term, the administration is signaling support for expanding the CFTC’s mandate, backed by legislative proposals and a broader pro-crypto regulatory outlook. One of the most consequential efforts is the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act. First introduced in 2023 and gaining traction in 2025, the bill aims to define digital commodities and grant the CFTC regulatory authority over their spot markets. Industry participants have long cited regulatory uncertainty as a barrier to growth, particularly in response to the enforcement-heavy approach taken by the Securities and Exchange Commission under former Chair Gary Gensler. The proposed legislation would position the CFTC as the lead agency for digital commodities such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, giving it a more central role in shaping the crypto economy. Legal developments may be aligning in the agency’s favor, but practical challenges remain. The CFTC’s 2025 budget stands at $365 million, significantly lower than the SEC’s $2.4 billion. Expanding its jurisdiction without a corresponding increase in resources could limit its ability to deliver on new responsibilities. Leadership capacity is also stretched. Once Caroline Pham steps down, only Commissioner Kristin Johnson will remain. Quintenz’s confirmation would fill a crucial gap, but it also concentrates decision-making at a time when the agency’s direction is still being negotiated. The CFTC’s future will depend not only on who leads it, but also on whether it is equipped with the authority, personnel, and funding needed to carry out a broader mandate. Without those elements, efforts to modernize oversight may fall short of their intended impact.",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/brian-quintenz-cftc-nomination-conflict/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION","Feature|CFTC|Donald Trump|Regulation",cryptocompare

This metric, showing the price gap between Coinbase’s BTC/USD and Binance’s BTC/USDT quotes, is a popular proxy for gauging U.S. retail buyer appetite. On Friday, the Coinbase Premium touched $109.55—its largest spread since February 3. Earlier this week, CryptoQuant contributor “Crypto Dan” in a Quicktake update described the pattern as characteristic of early-cycle recovery after correction, without signs of overheating. This suggested continued bullish momentum into the second half of 2025. Simultaneously, institutional interest appears to be rebounding. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, especially BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), are drawing significant inflows and currently lead in assets under management. CryptoQuant also highlighted a notable decline in on‑chain BTC reserves on exchanges. Since July 2024, over 500,000 coins have exited spot exchange holdings. Baykuş, another CryptoQuant contributor, noted this trend is no accident. “People aren’t selling—they’re holding. They’re not day trading, they’re holding for the long term.” He framed this movement as a hidden foundation supporting the current rally toward $110,000. Taken together, increasing retail premiums on Coinbase, strengthening institutional inflows into ETFs, and dwindling exchange supply paint a bullish outlook for Bitcoin’s price.

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) says Jalen Tylee Hill, 26, stole numerous checks out of residential and commercial mailboxes in Georgia. Hill would then recruit people on Facebook by offering to deposit the stolen checks into their bank accounts on the condition that they would split half the funds. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Georgia says Hill stole hundreds of pieces of mail, participated in at least 68 instances of bank fraud and illegally used other people’s debit cards on at least 14 occasions. “Hill then deposited, or attempted to deposit, the numerous stolen, forged or otherwise fraudulent checks of more than ten financial institutions into other bank accounts, resulting in an intended loss of approximately $165,743.68. As part of another scheme discovered by investigators, Hill created a fake solar panel installation company recruiting page online from which he stole the identities of 28 individuals, including their driver’s licenses, Social Security cards, birth certificates, instructional permits and other documents depicting personally identifiable information.” Last year, Hill pled guilty to one count of bank fraud, one count of aggravated identity theft and one count of conspiracy to possess stolen mail. Fourteen other codefendants have also been convicted for their participation in Hill’s scheme.

In a new interview with CNBC, Goldman Sachs executive David Kostin says “hard data” may soon override some of the “soft data” that has caused uncertainty in markets. “Well, the equity market traditionally trades more on the soft data than on the hard data. And the expectation is that we’ve had a weak bout of soft data—maybe some of that may be turning…” Kostin says in the short term, US equities may face downside as tariff-driven uncertainty materializes, but that by the end of the year, he’s looking at about a 10% performance on the S&P 500. He also says a recession is not in the bank’s base case forecast. “In the next month or two, you get some hard data. It will be weaker. You get some uncertainty around the earnings. The blackout period for company share repurchases basically ends later this week or the early part of next week. In terms of the month before earnings season, companies are still able to repurchase – discretionarily – their shares. So these are some of the variables, the signposts you’re looking at. We’re looking at them, clients are looking at them. Looking out further into next year, the economy is likely to continue to grow. We don’t have a recession in the forecast – that’s not the base case. And therefore, you’ve got earnings growth. Seven per cent this year, another 7% next year. That lifts the market to around 6500. Sixty-five hundred is roughly up nearly 10%.

While this institutional support has cemented Bitcoin’s status as a market leader, its high price and slower growth potential leave little room for newcomers seeking quick, high returns. Enter Ruvi AI, a blockchain project with tremendous upside, practical applications, and an accessible entry price of $0.015 per token in Phase 2 of its presale. Analysts see Ruvi AI as an intelligent choice for savvy investors ready to capture early-stage crypto growth. Bitcoin’s institutional momentum and its drawbacks for newcomers Unlike its early days, Bitcoin’s current boom is driven by institutional players such as hedge funds, corporations, and even governments acquiring significant holdings. This influx of institutional money has added legitimacy to Bitcoin, stabilizing its position as a long-term asset. However, Bitcoin’s significant price tag and market saturation create barriers for new investors hoping for substantial short-term gains. BTC’s growth has slowed compared to its explosive early years, making large returns improbable for those joining now. These limitations steer opportunity-seekers toward emerging projects like Ruvi AI that promise exponential returns at a fraction of Bitcoin’s upfront cost. Ruvi AI shines as a high-growth investment Ruvi AI has revolutionized the blockchain space with its AI-integrated solutions for industries like healthcare, logistics, and finance. Investors who participated in Ruvi AI’s Phase 1 presale saw their investments grow by an impressive 50% in just weeks, reflecting the project’s potential. Now in Phase 2, tokens are priced at a mere $ 0.015, providing an affordable entry point for newcomers. Unlike speculative projects, Ruvi AI’s valuation roadmap is clearly outlined. The token price is slated to rise to $0.07 following the presale, building confidence in its structured growth strategy.

2025-06-10T18:20:01,"American Bitcoin to produce Bitcoin below-market cost","American Bitcoin, a mining company backed by President Donald Trump’s two eldest sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., has accumulated 215 BTC worth over $23 million since its founding in April this year. In a filing submitted to the SEC, the company, formally known as ABTC, said that it views Bitcoin as a long-term asset and intends to continue increasing its holdings. American Bitcoin, backed by the TRUMP FAMILY, is making BIG moves. It quietly grabbed 215 $BTC ($23M) since April. Which other company is buying BTC quietly? 👇 pic.twitter.com/rcQvCgd8DL — Wise Advice (@wiseadvicesumit) June 10, 2025 “Bitcoin accumulation is not a side effect of ABTC’s business. It is the business. ABTC’s Layer 2 strategy is designed to transform its Bitcoin production into long-term Bitcoin ownership” , it wrote. American Bitcoin to produce Bitcoin below-market cost ABTC said in the filing that it spends directly on mining instead of investing in physical infrastructure. The company has more than 60,000 miners, mostly from Bitmain and MicroBT, spread out across three facilities in New York, Alberta, and Texas, handled by Hut 8. These miners do a total of 10.17 exahashes every second and use an average of 21.2 joules per terahash. Through its partnership with Hut 8, ABTC can keep costs low while increasing output and keeping its capital flexible. “ABTC’s foundation is built on producing Bitcoin below-market cost through a capital efficient, infrastructure-light operating model,” it wrote. The miners who work for ABTC add their computing power to well-known pools like Foundry and Luxor. Daily mining rewards are given out based on how much hashrate is contributed, and pool fees are kept below 1%. “ABTC’s goal is to utilize public markets and strategic financing structures to access efficient capital and leverage that capital to increase its Bitcoin in reserve per share,” it wrote ABTC has what it calls a “three-tiered strategy” at its core. This means creating a mining business that works well and doesn’t cost too much, using capital to increase its Bitcoin reserves, and getting involved in Bitcoin’s larger ecosystem. The Bitcoin ABTC stores with Coinbase Custody are kept in “cold wallets.” To make the storage more secure, the company uses multifactor authentication and whitelisted withdrawal methods. The Gryphon merger is still in the picture American Bitcoin said in May that it would go public by merging with Gryphon Digital Mining. The agreement is set up as a stock-for-stock deal, and the combined company will use the American Bitcoin brand. After the deal, Eric Trump will be on the company board. Also, Hut 8 owns most of American Bitcoin and will still have a management role after the merger. As per the deal, current American Bitcoin shareholders will own around 98% of the new business. Hut 8 will keep running the mines and handling their infrastructure. They hope to make steady money through long-term business deals. Meanwhile, BTC users have shown excitement. Tectum has said , “Bitcoin holdings grow, and so does the need for efficient ways to use them.” On the other hand, Alva has warned that BTC is holding strong above key moving averages, and US accumulation trends continue fueling bullish sentiment without direct confirmation of high-profile political buyers. “Social buzz is amped up, with political narratives keeping traders alert to possible big inflows. Volume signals steady demand, but watch RSI for overbought hints. If the political narrative really heats up, a technical breakout could follow—are you ready for the next volatility burst?” Ava added.

2025-06-10T18:09:20,"Five fraudsters plead guilty in $37M crypto scheme","In a significant development in the fight against cryptocurrency fraud, five individuals have pleaded guilty to their roles in a multinational scam that defrauded victims of approximately $37 million. This case, prosecuted by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), underscores the growing threat of crypto-related crimes and the increasing efforts by law enforcement to hold perpetrators accountable. As digital currencies continue to gain popularity, so do the schemes designed to exploit unsuspecting investors. A multinational crypto scam The $36.9 million cryptocurrency fraud scheme targeted American citizens through a sophisticated operation that leveraged social media, dating apps, and messaging platforms to build trust with victims. According to reports, the scammers posed as legitimate investment advisors or romantic interests, convincing individuals to invest in fake cryptocurrency opportunities. Once trust was established through prolonged communication via calls and texts, the fraudsters directed victims to transfer funds to shell companies or fraudulent platforms, after which the money was funneled out of the country, ultimately being sent to Cambodia. The five individuals who pleaded guilty admitted to various roles in the operation, including orchestrating the scam, laundering money, and managing the deceptive communications with victims. Joseph Wong, Yicheng Zhang, Jose Somarriba, Shengsheng He, and Jingliang Su, who pleaded guilty, were scattered in multiple countries, including the US, Spain, China, and Turkey. Zhang and Wong face 20-year prison sentences for money laundering conspiracy charges. The other three fraudsters could receive up to 5-year sentences for operating an unlicensed money services business. Zhang and Su have been in custody since November 2024, with Su scheduled to face a sentencing hearing in November. The number of people who have pleaded guilty to this crypto scam operation has reached 8, with Daren Li and Lu Zhang who pleaded guilty on money laundering charges in 2024. The rise of cryptocurrency fraud Cryptocurrency fraud has become a pressing issue as digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum gain mainstream adoption. The decentralized and often anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies makes them an attractive tool for criminals. According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), consumers reported losing over $1 billion to crypto scams between January 2021 and March 2022 alone. These scams often take the form of investment fraud, romance scams, or phishing schemes designed to steal personal information or funds. The $37 million scam is just one of many high-profile cases in recent years. For instance, the DOJ has also pursued cases involving larger sums, such as a $1.89 billion cryptocurrency fraud scheme announced in January 2024, where three individuals were charged or pleaded guilty. These cases demonstrate a pattern of sophisticated operations that prey on the lack of regulation and public understanding of digital currencies. As reported by Cointelegraph, the methods used in the $37 million scam are consistent with a growing trend of ‘pig butchering’ scams, where fraudsters build long-term relationships with victims before convincing them to invest in fraudulent schemes.

2025-06-10T18:07:03,"Bitcoin’s OP_RETURN Limit Soars to Nearly 4MB in Core 30 Update","The Bitcoin Core development team has announced a major update in the upcoming October Core 30 release. The changes will increase the OP_RETURN data limit from 80 bytes to nearly 4 MB. Community Debate The proposal removes the long-standing default size limits on OP_RETURN, a transaction commonly used to embed non-financial data into the blockchain. Right now, Bitcoin Core only allows a small amount of data in OP_RETURN. The update would let Core relay much larger transactions by default. The idea has received both support and criticism on GitHub, with the debate centered on whether Bitcoin nodes should block non-monetary transactions or act as neutral relayers of any valid transaction. Those against it argue that removing the limit could invite spam and non-monetary data into Bitcoin blocks, which could occupy space intended for financial transactions. According to them, keeping the current limits protects Bitcoin’s economic value and keeps it efficient. They also say that removing settings like -datacarriersize would reduce node control. Comments from Seccour, chrisguida, and wizkid057 express concern that the change gives in to spammers and encourages misuse of Bitcoin. They all agree that the network should resist spam instead of making it easier. Supporters of the update believe that storing arbitrary data on Bitcoin is already happening and cannot be stopped. They say trying to block it leads to users resorting to worse methods, such as making private deals with miners. The group argues that OP_RETURN is the least harmful method. This is because it is small, cannot be spent, and does not add to the UTXO set. They say increasing the limit can guide data use to this cleaner method and avoid worse alternatives. Comments from murchandamus and eragmus support the decision, with one arguing that it would reduce node traffic and help prevent miner centralization. The other explained that it is a practical change that matches how the network is already used. A Push for Greater Decentralization Bitcoin Core has limited OP_RETURN to 80 bytes since 2014. However, developers announced in May that the cap would be removed in the next version. In a recent statement, they explained that the decision aligns with Core’s goal of reflecting economically relevant activity by ensuring that transactions likely to be mined are relayed. They added that blocking these transactions weakens decentralization, drives users to alternative channels, and ultimately fails to keep the data off the blockchain. Allowing them, they explained, preserves Bitcoin’s censorship resistance and ensures the network operates efficiently. “This is not endorsing or condoning non-financial data usage, but accepting that as a censorship-resistant system, Bitcoin can and will be used for use cases not everyone agrees on,” the statement read.

2025-06-10T18:06:29,"Charles Hoskinson Unveils Cardinal, Unlocking Bitcoin Liquidity for Cardano DeFi","Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has unveiled Cardinal, a new protocol that he explains will bring Bitcoin-native DeFi to the Cardano network for the first time, according to an X post on June 9. Welcome to the first Bitcoin DeFi protocol developed for Cardano https://t.co/CoYvrYnIfI — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) June 9, 2025 The launch is a step forward for both blockchains, allowing users to tap into Bitcoin’s liquidity while using Cardano’s smart contract capabilities and lower transaction fees. Non-Custodial, Cross-Chain DeFi with Bitcoin at the Core Unveiled this week, Cardinal introduces a trust-minimized model for wrapping BTC without relying on centralized custodians or federations—an issue long debated within the crypto space. “Wrapped BTC today comes with tradeoffs,” said Romain Pellerin, CTO at InputOutputHK. “Custodians. Federations. Risk. Cardinal flips the model.” At the core of Cardinal is a new primitive that allows users to wrap any BTC UTXO, so it can be used in DeFi use cases such as lending, borrowing, and staking. The protocol allows Bitcoin to remain locked under MuSig2 aggregated multisignature schemes, while a wrapped UTXO is minted cross-chain and remains redeemable at any time via a fraud-proofed peg-out system. “No rehypothecation. No compromise,” Pellerin added, emphasizing security and transparency. Built on a combination of Bitcoin HTLCs, Cardano smart contracts, and BitVMX for verifiable off-chain execution, Cardinal is designed to be compatible with any smart Layer 1, not just Cardano. It also introduces the first trust-minimized Ordinal bridge from Bitcoin to Cardano’s mainnet. “Ordinals can now be used in DeFi, serve as collateral, be auctioned across chains, and borrow or lend value without losing provenance,” Pellerin explained. The protocol creates wrapped assets—whether NFTs or tokens—that are natively pegged 1:1, transferable on-chain, and burnable to release BTC or Ordinals. With Cardinal, Cardano is positioning itself as a serious contender in cross-chain DeFi by bringing Bitcoin’s value and security into the programmable environment of smart contracts, all while staying true to Bitcoin’s trustless motto. A Strategic Play in the Multi-Chain DeFi Arena Cardinal’s debut comes amid growing demand for decentralized, trustless alternatives to traditional finance. In the wake of multiple high-profile collapses of custodial platforms, protocols like Cardinal are gaining attention for bringing Bitcoin into DeFi without compromising its core principles. Analysts suggest that this move could strengthen Cardano’s position in the multi-chain DeFi race, especially as Ethereum’s gas fees remain high and Bitcoin lacks programmability. Cardano’s strengths in formal verification and academic development may appeal to developers looking for a more secure foundation for cross-chain applications. Cardano Price Prediction Cardano (ADA) has fallen nearly 16% in the past month as the crypto rally faltered amid rising trade tensions between the United States and China , reports Alejandro Arrieche for CryptoNews. Investor sentiment has also been souring lately as reflected by the Fear and Greed Index , whose value has dropped from a local peak of 76 (Greed) to 55 at the time of writing, meaning that investors have now adopted a more cautious approach in what is a relatively uncertain scenario. Cardano’s price prediction centers around the $0.66 level—an area that has acted as a key accumulation zone and one that ADA quickly reclaimed after its recent bearish breakout.

2025-06-10T18:05:30,"Best Crypto to Buy Now? Why Is The Bitcoin Price Going Up","Bitcoin’s rebound over the last 48 hours has flipped expectations. After sitting near $102000, the token climbed beyond $110000 in a move that few saw coming this quickly. Investors who had braced for a slide toward the $97000 range are now reassessing. While the recovery itself has already captured attention, there is more in play. A string of developments, both regulatory and institutional, has begun surfacing at the same time. These aren’t just headlines, but also point to deeper shifts that may support further growth. If the current momentum holds, this phase may prove more meaningful than a simple short-term bounce, especially with renewed confidence in digital assets growing in multiple directions at once. Why Is Bitcoin Going Up - Crypto Market Structure, Policy Shifts, and Technical Analysis The past few days have delivered a sequence of updates that paint a clearer picture for the blockchain space today. At the policy level, SEC Chair Paul Atkins has made a rare but important statement in favor of crypto autonomy. Speaking at a DeFi roundtable, he backed the idea that users should have full control over their digital assets without being forced into centralized custody. Atkins also called for a tailored exemption that would allow builders to bring DeFi products to market without the friction that has so far slowed innovation. If this framework gets adopted, it could speed up development across the space. Two single stock ETFs based on peer to peer payments Circle Internet Group $CRCL which only just IPO'd last Thursday:ProShares Ultra CRCL ETF (leveraged 2x)Bitwise CRCL Option Income Strategy ETF (covered call)ticker/fees: tbaeffective date: August 20, 2025Circle Internet… pic.twitter.com/y57RvMgKjf — ETF Hearsay by Henry Jim (@ETFhearsay) June 9, 2025 In parallel, filings for two ETFs tied to Circle’s stock have landed on the SEC’s desk. One comes from Bitwise, the other from ProShares. Both are designed to offer investors exposure to Circle’s equity performance, a company that already plays a major role in stablecoin infrastructure. If greenlit, these funds would begin trading in August and may create a path for traditional investors to engage indirectly with stablecoins. Technically, Bitcoin’s structure supports the optimism. After testing the top end of its Bollinger range near $110800 , the price pulled back modestly but continues to hold above the midline. Volume has eased slightly, but the lack of strong selling pressure suggests there may still be room for another upward push. When paired with the policy shift and the institutional interest around stablecoin-backed equities, this setup feels less speculative and more grounded. The conditions that once pointed toward a breakdown are now pointing elsewhere, and for altcoins, this may be the window they have been waiting for. Best Crypto to Buy Now – Cryptos That May Pump 10x Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper is a recently introduced presale that focuses on fixing the well-known efficiency issues of the original network. It does so by introducing a custom-built Layer 2 that uses the Solana Virtual Machine. This allows for fast, low-cost transactions while still being anchored to Bitcoin’s security model. The process is simple but intentional: users send Bitcoin to a specified address, which gets validated via smart contracts, and in return, they receive a token that behaves like Bitcoin on the faster chain. Where Bitcoin Hyper separates itself is not just in design, but in execution. The early stages of the rollout have moved quickly, with strong user uptake and consistent presale traction. Many L2 solutions stumble when it comes to integrating with existing Bitcoin holdings, but this protocol seems to have made that bridge less clunky. With Bitcoin avoiding the correction that many anticipated, and renewed confidence spilling over from regulatory discussions and ETF filings, projects built on Bitcoin’s infrastructure have more room to grow. The project has also been covered by top creators like ClayBro and others. Bitcoin Hyper doesn’t rely on trendiness or slogans. It’s aiming to solve a problem that has been discussed since Bitcoin’s early days. If its system continues to scale without network hiccups, it could find serious traction especially now, when speed and flexibility are no longer optional for protocols that want to stay relevant in an increasingly impatient market. SUBBD SUBBD is focused on creators, but not in the shallow, tokenized way that’s been tried before. This is not another tipping system or content paywall. SUBBD builds a structure around the concept of audience equity, where creators issue their own vault tokens backed by community staking, engagement, and visibility. These tokens are tradable, but what matters more is what they represent, which is ownership in a creator’s trajectory. That idea has existed before, but SUBBD is the first to make it operational with smart contract enforcement, a native marketplace, and token utility layered across multiple tools. Its real value becomes more noticeable during periods when crypto sentiment begins to lean constructive, like now. Bitcoin’s recent climb and a growing interest in decentralized product frameworks have made investors more attentive to utility-driven protocols again. Want exclusive content? You’ve gotta earn it 🔥Introducing Fundraising on $SUBBD , where the crowd comes together to unlock special content drops.The more support, the hotter the reward. Ready to unlock? pic.twitter.com/ofKnYzzrCs — SUBBD (@SUBBDofficial) June 8, 2025 SUBBD fits this mood. Instead of chasing volume with gimmicks, it’s proposing a full shift in how creators monetize influence, moving the financial power away from centralized platforms and toward token-backed ecosystems controlled by communities. With its presale still open and social numbers climbing, the project appears to be gaining ground without overextending itself. The architecture allows room for staking, governance, and resale markets, and the visual dashboard already makes clear how the economics of creators and followers are linked. If market interest continues to lean toward decentralized solutions, SUBBD has the structural ingredients to benefit from that shift without needing a market boom to stay relevant. Solaxy Solaxy focuses on something most projects only claim to support, which is scalability across networks. Built as a Layer 2 bridge for both Solana and Ethereum ecosystems, it enables token movement, staking, and on-chain activity between the two without locking users into a single blockchain. This might sound technical, but the practical impact is simple: less friction, more options. And in crypto, that often makes the difference between a tool being used or ignored. Its own token, SOLX, plays a double role. First, it fuels staking rewards for users who provide liquidity across supported chains. Second, it underpins validator infrastructure tied to Solana’s internal growth. This second piece is worth noting, especially now. With policy shifts showing signs of softening, and interest growing around stablecoins and chain infrastructure, projects with cross-chain liquidity mechanics are better positioned to gain user attention and capital flow. Solaxy is expanding faster than the universe! 🛸46M Raised! 🔥 pic.twitter.com/RM3lsZeMha — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) June 9, 2025 Solaxy has also benefited from not being overexposed. It hasn’t promised absurd returns or flooded social media with hype. Instead, it’s been quietly building, maintaining validator integrations, and expanding bridge support. That approach fits well with the current environment, where noise is fading and real use cases are gaining visibility again. The market may still be cautious, but when Bitcoin holds strength and policy commentary favors innovation, frameworks like Solaxy become more than just technical achievements. They start to look like necessities. And that’s when growth stops being speculative and starts being organic. Snorter For what it’s actually trying to do, simply calling Snorter a trading bot wouldn’t be fair. The project essentially acts as a market utility layer that connects user intent with real-time execution across volatile tokens, especially memecoins. It uses adaptive tracking mechanisms, sentiment feeds, and social trend data to identify potential breakout movements before they become obvious. The interface simplifies all this into one-click decision funnels for users who want exposure but not noise. What’s interesting is that Snorter isn’t just meant for day traders or high-frequency players. Even passive users can set predefined triggers, letting the system allocate and adjust micro-positions as markets shift. This kind of automation has existed before, but not often with the kind of meme-sector integration that Snorter is building toward. Its relevance is clearer now as Bitcoin’s recovery has prompted a fresh wave of activity across smaller-cap coins. Whenever BTC moves with conviction, liquidity tends to spill over, and this is the zone where Snorter thrives. The protocol doesn't rely on Bitcoin, but it gains operational advantage when overall volume rises. Unlike many automation platforms that quietly run scripts in the background, Snorter brings visual feedback and in-depth breakdowns to the front. With market participation rising and self-custody becoming a renewed priority at the regulatory level, tools like this that emphasize transparency, speed, and strategic access may not just stay useful. They could become part of the new normal. BTC Bull BTC Bull doesn’t need to chase attention. The token openly reflects a thesis that has existed since the early days of crypto: community is Bitcoin’s strongest multiplier. Instead of trying to extend Bitcoin’s technology, BTC Bull builds around its idea, using design, token incentives, and shared ownership to create a loyalty loop that ties users to Bitcoin’s rise in a more interactive way. There are no layers or chains being added here. The draw lies in the way participation is rewarded. Every element, from visuals to staking logic, is shaped to mirror and support Bitcoin’s movements while still offering separate upside to holders of the token. That creates a unique layer of connection that isn't forced or symbolic. It's built into the structure. With Bitcoin regaining strength and proving more stable than many expected, BTC Bull is gaining visibility as a community-forward option that benefits when confidence returns. Its early stages are still unfolding, and that works to its advantage. There’s no baggage from previous cycles. No overpromises to walk back. It exists now, during a moment where regulatory signals are softening and investor interest is widening again. BTC Bull doesn’t pretend to be infrastructure. It’s culture. But within that simplicity, there’s a clear use case offering a stake in Bitcoin enthusiasm without needing to directly hold or move BTC itself. That’s not a replacement. It’s a companion. And for many in the current market, that’s exactly the kind of exposure they’re looking for. Conclusion The past few days have shifted the outlook. Bitcoin held above key levels, avoided the expected drop, and showed signs of stability that weren’t present earlier. At the same time, policy comments and structural developments have pointed toward fewer restrictions and more room for innovation. When technicals and external signals begin to align, it often marks the start of a new phase. Whether this turns into a broader trend depends on follow-through, but the conditions no longer suggest a market under pressure. They now suggest one preparing for its next move, making the options mentioned above some of the best worth considering.

2025-06-10T18:05:03,"BlackRock Bitcoin Fund Flies Past $70,000,000,000 Faster Than Any Other ETF in History: Bloomberg Analyst","BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust exchange-traded fund has passed the $70 billion mark faster than any other ETF in history by a long shot, according to analysts. Bloomberg ETF specialist Eric Balchunas says in a post on the social media platform X that IBIT has surpassed the $70 billion mark five times faster than the gold-based GLD product. “IBIT just blew through $70b and is now the fastest ETF to ever hit that mark in only 341 days, which is 5x faster than the old record held by GLD of 1,691 days… When BlackRock filed for IBIT, the price was $30k and the stench of FTX was still in air. It’s now $110k (a return that is 7x that of the mighty S&P 500) and is now seen as legitimate for other big investors.” Source: Eric Balchunas/X According to data from blockchain analytics platform Arkham , BlackRock currently holds $76.19 billion worth of digital assets in its crypto wallets. In his annual letter to investors, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that US dollar supremacy can’t last forever and is already being weakened, not only due to skyrocketing debt but also the rise of digital assets and decentralized finance (DeFi). Says Fink, “The US has benefited from the dollar serving as the world’s reserve currency for decades. But that’s not guaranteed to last forever. The national debt has grown at three times the pace of GDP since Times Square’s debt clock started ticking in 1989.57 This year, interest payments will surpass $952 billion— exceeding defense spending. By 2030, mandatory government spending and debt service will consume all federal revenue, creating a permanent deficit. If the US doesn’t get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin. To be clear, I’m obviously not anti-digital assets (far from it; see the next section). But two things can be true at the same time: Decentralized finance is an extraordinary innovation. It makes markets faster, cheaper, and more transparent. Yet that same innovation could undermine America’s economic advantage if investors begin seeing Bitcoin as a safer bet than the dollar.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Aave Price Movements Reinforce Key Entry and Exit Zones Aave has seen dynamic price swings over the past month and six months. The coin rose about 26.62% in the last month, showing a burst of short-term strength and increased buying interest. In contrast, performance over the past six months slipped approximately 4.32%, highlighting a mixed longer-term picture. A weekly gain of roughly 12.01% adds to the recent optimism, even though the extended view reveals persistent challenges. Price volatility remains evident as the market digests these varied trends. Currently, Aave trades between $179.40 and $298.70, with a key resistance level near $350.42 that traders watch with keen interest. Bulls are entering aggressively at times, driving the price upward, yet bears still step in during pullbacks, resulting in an unclear overall trend direction. While the short-term rally hints at bullish energy, the technical setup remains cautious. A support level at approximately $111.81 offers a potential floor, encouraging entries close to this zone if a bounce is detected. A breakout above $350.42 could trigger aggressive buying, though traders should be mindful of the second resistance at $469.73. Uniswap Market Snapshot: Recent Volatility and Key Price Levels Price action over the past month and half-year shows notable swings. Uniswap advanced by 9.60% in one week, yet declined by 6.39% over the month and dropped sharply by 58.74% over the half-year period. Fluctuations reached heights in a narrow range, hinting at recovery attempts after deep corrections. Movements spanned from resilient surges to broad downtrends, revealing periods of optimism followed by significant pullbacks. These variations point to a market that, while capable of sharp upward bursts, remains vulnerable to extended declines during broader market weaknesses. Currently, Uniswap trades within a range between $4.62 and $7.58, with a key support level at $3.20 and nearby resistance at $9.12. Second support at $0.239 and an additional resistance near $12.08 further outline trading boundaries. Indicators suggest mixed signals with upward pressure present, yet caution is warranted due to earlier declines. Bulls are attempting to assert dominance, but the lack of a clear trend encourages careful trading. Traders should consider positioning near support while planning exits at resistance if the price breaks above this area. Bittensor Price Trends and Key Levels for Trading Opportunities Bittensor experienced mixed behavior in recent trading sessions. In the last month, prices declined by about 7.7% after a brief rise of 6.19%. Over the past six months, the coin’s value dropped significantly by almost 28.65%, showing prolonged downward pressure. The recent weekly bounce did little to offset the negative trend, emphasizing the coin’s vulnerability to volatility. These statistics highlight a short-term strength amid ongoing weakness. Current trading levels for Bittensor show a price range between $346 and $507, with immediate resistance at $583.90 and support at $262.30. A second resistance is at $744.70, while a lower support lies at $101.50. Technical indicators suggest that bulls and bears are balanced, as the price moves within a narrow channel. Traders might consider buying near support levels while remaining cautious until a clear trend emerges. Conclusion The recent surge in Bitcoin has set the stage for other cryptocurrencies to shine. AAVE , UNI , and TAO are among the projects poised to benefit. These coins have strong fundamentals and promising potential. This momentum can translate to significant growth for these assets, making them worth watching in the coming months. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-06-10T17:45:11,"$5 ADA Target Envisioned for Cardano as Whales Scoop Up Over 120 Million ADA in a Day","Cardano (ADA) traded mildly weaker on Tuesday despite a strong showing earlier in the week. The broader crypto market experienced a pullback led by Bitcoin’s dip to around $108,923 at press time. However, ADA’s resilience over the past few days, with four consecutive bullish daily candles since Friday, has analysts eyeing a potential breakout that could rival its all-time highs. Popular crypto analyst Javon Marks has reignited bullish sentiment, tweeting that Cardano could surge as much as 666% from current levels. “Using ADA (Cardano)’s previous bull cycle as a guide for this one,” Marks wrote, “ prices could be setting up for another move to and above its 1.272 Fibonacci Level, which is currently at the ~$5.35 price point.” Notably, this mirrors a similar prediction he made in March, reinforcing his long-term outlook based on Fibonacci extension models. If his forecast holds, it would mark one of the most substantial rallies among major altcoins. Marks isn’t the only analyst turning bullish on ADA. Master Ananda also pointed to a consistent pattern of higher lows since June 2023. According to him, recent support zones formed between February and April 2025 suggest a breakout could soon take shape. “Cardano looks great,” Ananda tweeted . “ After four weeks of retrace, we can expect soon higher prices. $2.65 and $4.29 are the main targets.” Adding to the optimism, analyst Trend Rider highlighted a possible “double bottom” formation in ADA’s chart. This is a bullish reversal pattern that, according to academic research, predicts price increases with about 65% accuracy when confirmed by trading volume. That said, the growing bullish sentiment is also being supported by on-chain data. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed Tuesday that whales have accumulated over 120 million ADA tokens in the past 48 hours, based on data from Santiment. Whale activity of this magnitude often precedes price rallies, as it signals rising confidence from influential market players. Beyond price charts and market speculation, Cardano’s fundamental developments are strengthening the case for a long-term rally. On Monday, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson announced the launch of “Cardinal”, the blockchain’s first Bitcoin-backed DeFi protocol. Cardinal allows users to engage in defi using BTC on Cardano without relying on centralized custodians, utilizing advanced cryptographic tools like MuSig2 and wrapped UTXO. The Cardinal protocol enables BTC to be used across DeFi platforms such as MinswapDEX, SundaeSwap, and Fluid Tokens for trading, lending, and collateral, all while preserving full self-custody. Following the announcement, ADA’s trading volume soared nearly 70% to $839 million, with ADA climbing 2.36% in the past 24 hours to trade at $0.7 at press time.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/5-ada-target-envisioned-for-cardano-as-whales-scoop-up-over-120-million-ada-in-a-day/,"ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano",cryptocompare
2025-06-10T17:39:10,"Bitcoin Demand Soars: US Investors Pull BTC From Exchanges Signaling Strong Conviction","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Demand Soars: US Investors Pull BTC From Exchanges Signaling Strong Conviction The cryptocurrency market is always buzzing with activity, but recent data points towards a significant shift specifically within the United States. We’re seeing compelling evidence that U.S. Bitcoin demand is experiencing a notable resurgence, driven by factors that suggest long-term conviction rather than speculative trading. Understanding the Surge in U.S. Bitcoin Demand One of the most closely watched indicators for U.S. buying interest in Bitcoin is the Coinbase Premium. This metric tracks the price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase, a major U.S. exchange, and other global exchanges like Binance. A positive premium suggests stronger buying pressure on Coinbase compared to elsewhere, often signaling demand from U.S.-based investors, both retail and institutional. According to data from on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, the Coinbase Premium has recently reached its highest level since February 3rd, hitting a significant $109.55. This substantial premium indicates that buyers on Coinbase are willing to pay a premium for Bitcoin, a clear sign of robust U.S. demand entering the market. Significant Bitcoin Exchange Withdrawals Point to Long-Term Holding Beyond the premium on U.S. exchanges, another critical data point supporting the narrative of increasing Bitcoin exchange withdrawals. Since July 2024, a staggering 550,000 BTC have been pulled from known exchange wallets. This movement is particularly significant because it often suggests investors are moving their assets into cold storage or private wallets, signaling an intent to hold for the long term rather than keeping funds on exchanges for potential quick selling. Think of it this way: if you plan to sell your Bitcoin soon, you keep it on an exchange for easy access. If you believe the price will rise significantly over time and you intend to hold for months or years, you withdraw it to a more secure, non-custodial wallet. The large volume of these withdrawals points to a collective investor mindset focused on accumulation and holding. What Does the Coinbase Premium Tell Us About BTC Demand? Let’s delve a little deeper into the Coinbase Premium. While $109.55 might seem like a small number relative to Bitcoin’s price, it represents a significant percentage difference that traders and analysts pay close attention to. Historically, periods of sustained positive Coinbase Premium have coincided with strong upward price movements for Bitcoin, as it reflects consistent buying pressure from a major market participant base. The recent spike suggests that despite any recent price corrections or sideways movement, the appetite for acquiring Bitcoin among U.S. investors remains strong. This persistent buying is absorbing available supply, contributing to the upward price pressure observed in the market. Expert Bitcoin Market Analysis on Current Trends On-chain data provides valuable insights, but expert interpretation helps piece the puzzle together. Crypto analyst Crypto Dan weighed in on the trend of exchange withdrawals, suggesting that this behavior reflects a typical pattern seen during a post-correction bullish cycle. In such cycles, savvy investors tend to accumulate during price dips and then move those holdings off exchanges in anticipation of future price appreciation. Another analyst, known as Baykuş, echoed this sentiment, noting that investors are steadily pulling BTC off exchanges. Baykuş interprets this as a clear signal of strong conviction to hold rather than sell. This reinforces the idea that current buyers are not short-term speculators but rather individuals and institutions with a longer time horizon, confident in Bitcoin’s future value. Here’s a quick summary of the key data points and analyst insights: Coinbase Premium: Reached $109.55, highest since Feb 3rd, indicating strong U.S. buying pressure. Exchange Withdrawals: 550,000 BTC withdrawn since July 2024, suggesting movement towards long-term holding. Crypto Dan’s View: Withdrawal behavior is typical of a post-correction bullish accumulation phase. Baykuş’s View: Steady withdrawals signal strong investor conviction to hold rather than sell. Implications of Strong U.S. Conviction What does this mean for the broader Bitcoin market analysis? When long-term holders remove supply from exchanges, it reduces the amount of Bitcoin readily available for sale. With persistent demand, especially from a major market like the U.S., a reduction in available supply can create a supply shock, potentially leading to upward price pressure. The combination of rising Coinbase Premium and significant exchange outflows paints a picture of a market where new demand is being met with reduced selling pressure from those accumulating. This dynamic is often characteristic of periods preceding or during bullish price trends. Challenges and Considerations While the data is compelling, it’s important to remember that the crypto market can be volatile. Macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, and unexpected events can still impact price action. However, the underlying trend of strong U.S. accumulation and withdrawal from exchanges provides a bullish fundamental backdrop that is difficult to ignore. Actionable Insights for Investors For those following the market, these indicators suggest that significant players, particularly in the U.S., are positioning themselves for potential long-term gains. While this analysis is positive, it is crucial to conduct your own research (DYOR) and consider your own risk tolerance before making any investment decisions. Understanding these on-chain metrics can provide valuable context, but they are just one piece of the puzzle. Conclusion: A Bullish Signal from the West The data is clear: U.S. demand for Bitcoin is surging, and investors are backing up that demand with action, moving hundreds of thousands of BTC off exchanges. The elevated Coinbase Premium confirms robust buying interest, while the large-scale withdrawals signal a strong conviction to hold for the future. Coupled with expert analysis pointing towards a post-correction accumulation phase, these trends paint a decidedly bullish picture for Bitcoin from the perspective of U.S. market participation. This confluence of factors suggests that many are anticipating further upside and are securing their positions for the long haul.
