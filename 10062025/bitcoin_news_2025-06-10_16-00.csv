2025-06-10T13:49:33,"Snorter Token Next 100x Crypto to Stake as Staked Ethereum Reaches ATH?","Around 34.69M $ETH is currently staked on the Beacon Chain. That’s a full 30% of Ethereum circulating supply, and might be part of the reason why Ethereum’s up 7% over the past month . In short, staking is good if you’re an $ETH investor. The situation proves one of crypto’s biggest selling points – the ability to generate long-term passive rewards from existing assets. Staking, in other words. If you’re already staking Ethereum, what’s the next crypto to add to your staking portfolio? And why stake instead of selling? We’ll answer those questions below. Crypto Staking Demonstrates Long-Term Commitment Think of staking like earning interest on a savings account. But instead of dollars or euros, you’re keeping cryptos like Ethereum or Solana in the account. And earning passive income while doing nothing. However, unlike fiat savings, which often depreciate because of inflation (and the interest can barely offset that), staked cryptos do the oppposite. They often appreciate while also earning interest. Stake $ETH, for instance, and it might explode over time, increasing in value while you keep earning more $ETH passively. Staking a cryptocurrency (whether $ETH or a crypto presale token) also supports the long-term future of that token by enhancing security and improving decentralization. It also establishes a healthy foundation for the blockchain to grow on. That’s because by staking, users have a vested interest in seeing the ecosystem and token grow consistently. Case in point, Ethereum’s currently experiencing a surge toward $2.8K, and the significant staked portion of its supply (30%) could have played a part in that. And when it comes to crypto presales, where tokens sell before the project launches on exchanges, the potential yield can be truly impressive – as with $SNORT’s current 487% dynamic APY. Speaking of Snort Token, here’s why it could be one of the best crypto to stake because of its sky-high staking APY and practical utility on Ethereum and Solana. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Sniff Out the Best Trades, Earn 487% APY Along the Way Snorter Token ($SNORT) powers the Snorter Bot, the best way to find hidden deals on Solana memecoins. Often traded on ‘underground’ platforms like Telegram, some of the best Solana meme coins are easily overlooked – 10x and 100x opportunities that even seasoned traders can overlook. But not anymore. The Snorter Bot finds those underground deals, sniffing them out to deliver the best returns possible. Snorter Bot deploys automatic sniping and fast swaps to snag the best opportunities, while limit orders (stop loss and take profit) reduce risk from fast-moving, low cap coins . Copy trading even lets you find and imitate other successful traders. And honeypot detection and rugpull protection let traders avoid common pitfalls that could lead to losing your investment. The Snorter Token – $SNORT – gives access to the planned Telegram dashboard and facilitates token swaps. Importantly, it also lets you stake tokens for a 487% dynamic APY. Yield from staked $SNORT will be disbursed over one year from the end of the presale, at the rate of 9.51 $SNORT per $ETH block. Roughly 5.1B $SNORT tokens are currently being staked, a little over 1% of the total supply of 500B. That means now is the best time to buy and stake $SNORT, as the dynamic APY will fall the more people stake their tokens. The Snorter Token presale has raised $650K, with tokens priced at $0.0947. Learn how to buy Snorter Token with our guide. Will Sky-High APY Supercharge Snorter Bot Presale as $ETH Staking Increases? Even as $ETH’s price rises, the stage is set for the best meme coins and crypto presales – like Snorter Bot – to take off. Could $SNORT 100x on the back of sky-high staking yield? It might, given enough community support. But remember isn’t financial advice – always do your own research.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/snorter-token-next-100x-crypto-to-stake/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Crypto News",cryptocompare

2025-06-10T13:36:14,"Angel Investor Says 10,000 XRP Portfolio Today Can Turn Into $2.5 Million","Angel investor Armando Pantoja has boldly asserted that a portfolio holding just a few thousand XRP tokens could grow to $2.5 million. Pantoja shared this perspective in a recent tweet, emphasizing the significance of holding 10,000 XRP tokens. He compared its potential to owning one whole Bitcoin or acquiring 50 Ethereum tokens.According to him, every financially savvy individual knows the value of holding 10,000 XRP, 1 Bitcoin, or 50 ETH — and simply waiting for the portfolio to grow, potentially reaching as high as $2.5 million. At that point, he recommends diversifying into even more secure investments, such as real estate.Buying 10,000 XRP and Turning It Into $2.5 MillionNotably, acquiring 10,000 XRP today would require an investment of $22,300, based on the current token price of $2.23. As of now, data from the XRP Rich List shows that only 166,170 wallets hold between 10,000 and 25,000 XRP, while 159,509 wallets hold between 5,000 and 10,000 tokens.For context, XRP has over 6.5 million wallet addresses. Less than 4% of these addresses hold at least 10,000 XRP. This highlights a significant disparity and how few investors meet this threshold. Conversely, over 5 million addresses hold 500 XRP or fewer, indicating that the majority of XRP holders are retail investors, while whales possess most of the supply.Meanwhile, analysts like Pantoja and Edoardo Farina of Alpha Lions Academy continue to stress the significance of holding 10,000 XRP tokens . According to them, this level of accumulation could lead to unprecedented financial freedom. Pantoja’s latest projection that 10,000 XRP could one day be worth $2.5 million reinforces this vision.With fewer than 4% of XRP wallets at this level, the analysts urge investors to consolidate and build their holdings to reach this threshold and join the top tier of XRP holders.Meanwhile, Pantoja’s proposition implies that XRP would need to rise to $250 per token for 10,000 XRP to be worth $2.5 million. This is a staggering increase of 11,111% from the current price of $2.23.Several analysts have echoed this bullish outlook, with some, like Javon Marks, suggesting a $250 price target could be achieved in this cycle. At that price, XRP’s market cap would reach approximately $15 trillion, up from about $131 billion today.Turning Bitcoin and Ethereum Portfolios Into $2.5 MillionPantoja also proposed that a portfolio containing 1 Bitcoin could be worth $2.5 million in the future. Currently, 1 BTC is at around $105,500. His prediction aligns with that of ARK Invest, which projects a potential price of $2.4 million per Bitcoin by 2030 in an extremely bullish scenario.As for Ethereum, holding 50 ETH today is worth about $125,000. For this portfolio to reach $2.5 million, Ethereum would need to rise to $50,000 per coin. According to prediction outlet Telegaon, ETH could reach that level between 2040 and 2050.Still, these projections, while promising, remain highly speculative.What to Do After Reaching $2.5 MillionPantoja suggests that once investors hit the $2.5 million mark, whether through XRP, Bitcoin, or Ethereum, the next step should be to purchase a home and invest in assets yielding 3% to 5% annually. This strategy, he says, would help cover taxes and allow one to live a life of financial freedom.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/10/angel-investor-says-10000-xrp-portfolio-today-can-turn-into-2-5-million/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=angel-investor-says-10000-xrp-portfolio-today-can-turn-into-2-5-million,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING|XRP","Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction",cryptocompare

2025-06-10T13:35:24,"Semler Scientific: This Bitcoin Proxy Isn't As Cheap As It Seems","Summary Semler Scientific has shifted focus to Bitcoin accumulation, but its stock underperforms BTC and MSTR despite aggressive treasury moves. The stock trades at a premium to its BTC holdings, reflecting both the core healthcare business and Bitcoin strategy, but isn't a bargain. Recent negative free cash flow, declining healthcare revenues, and legal uncertainties add risk and cloud the investment case. Given the fair valuation, execution risks, and better alternatives for Bitcoin exposure (buying BTC directly), I rate SMLR stock as a Hold. Semler Scientific ( SMLR ) used to just be a healthcare technology company focused on a cardiovascular testing product, but it's now like a mini Strategy Inc. ( MSTR ) with its Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) treasury ambitions. While it still has a small underlying healthcare business, Semler is now clearly a Bitcoin-focused company, buying up the asset as fast as it can and using debt and share issuances to do so. It's one of the largest corporate holders of BTC globally. The interesting thing is, if you look at the performance of Bitcoin and MSTR this year, up about 18% and 31%, respectively, and then look at Semler's performance of -38%, you'll notice a huge disconnect. Some may view this as an opportunity. I mean, SMLR stock is down more than 55% from its November 2024 swing high, while MSTR is off ""just"" 29% from its November high. At the same time, BTC is trading near an all-time high. So, what's going on with Semler stock? Should you buy it? There are a few reasons to buy but also a few reasons to avoid, and I don't think there's a clear opportunity here relative to buying BTC itself. I believe the stock is more or less fairly valued despite the underperformance. That's because Semler's market cap is still above the value of its BTC holdings (especially when factoring in net debt). So, I believe the difference between the market cap and the net value of BTC holdings can be thought of as how much the market is valuing the underlying health business, and I think the valuation the market assigns is probably fair but not a bargain. More detail on that later. The premium to the BTC holdings likely also prices in future optionality and leverage, so it's a combination of that and the core business. Another positive note to factor is that the stock has pulled back from a big run-up, so from a technical perspective, it could be ready for a short-term bounce. However, there are some risks involved. First of all, the business generated negative free cash flow in Q1 (which is highly unusual for this company), creating uncertainty. Second, it's hard to know the future trend of the healthcare business, with declining revenues and no estimates from analysts. There used to be analysts providing estimates, but it looks like they've given up. There's also execution risk with the BTC strategy, and I'd caution against buying a BTC-related stock with the crypto near an all-time high. As a result, the stock is a Hold. Let's Break Down The Valuation As of June 3, Semler Scientific held 4,449 BTC . At a price of $110,000 USD per Bitcoin, that's worth approximately $489.39 million. The company also had $9.9 million in cash as of March 31 and $96.1 million in debt (net cash of $86.2 million). Therefore, its BTC + net cash value is $403.2 million. Now, with a diluted share count of 15.653 million as of June 3 and a stock price of $33.99, the company’s market cap is ~$532.05 million. This implies that approximately $128.9 million of the market cap is being attributed to the healthcare business and the value of the BTC strategy itself. I also want to briefly mention that some websites understate its share count because they haven't updated it as of the most recent June 3 update, and this leads to the market cap being understated, which leads investors to thinking the stock is cheaper than it actually is. Is The $128.9M Premium Justified? The premium seems normal, given the pros and cons, which I'll explain. For example, Semler's core business has historically been FCF-positive. However, recent trends muddy the story a bit. In Q1 2025, healthcare revenue fell 44% year-over-year to $8.8 million, driven largely by CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) reimbursement changes. And management's commentary suggests that it's trying to minimize revenue losses from QuantaFlo, suggesting that growth will be harder to come by. For instance, Jennifer Herrington, the company's COO, stated the following during the Q1 earnings call: Our priority for 2025 is to minimize declines to QuantaFlo revenue while maintaining sufficient infrastructure to support, innovate and grow our operations related to other cardiovascular disease states. In addition, Q1 free cash flow was -$2.116 million, when it has always been positive in other quarters. SMLR's Quarterly Free Cash Flow (Finbox) That's a red flag, but it's also somewhat balanced by management's tone. Management stated that it plans to use the company's cash flow from operations to purchase more BTC. Would management say that if they were expecting negative cash flow? I don't think so, but I can't say for sure. Nonetheless, saying this is one thing, but now we need to see if negative cash flow is here to stay or not. We can also look at the company's historical FCF multiple to help us value the company. Prior to the BTC strategy starting in 2024, the stock's price/FCF multiple settled in the mid-teens. Let's call it 15x, for simplicity's sake. Semler's Historical Price/FCF Multiple (Finbox) But before, it was a business with growing FCF and revenue. Now, both metrics are declining. There's also a $29.8 million contingency reserve, which is how much Semler set aside in Q1 for a potential DOJ legal settlement. That adds more uncertainty. Therefore, a 15x multiple is unlikely now. Maybe 8-10x is more reasonable. With its TTM FCF of $16.7 million, an 8-10x multiple suggests a $133.6-167 million valuation for the core business. But will $16.7 million in TTM FCF be maintained, or will it keep dropping? We can also do a quick price/sales valuation. Eyeballing the chart below, the price/sales ratio was generally around 4.5x before the BTC strategy started. Data by YCharts But again, with the business deterioration, 4.5x is unlikely. Maybe 3x is more realistic. If we take the $8.8 million in revenue from Q1 and multiply it by four, we get an annualized revenue figure of $35.2 million. Give that a 3x multiple, and you get a $105.6 million valuation for the business. Overall, based on my quick napkin math, the $128.9 million valuation premium looks justified more or less , especially if you consider the bit of intangible (and hard to quantify) value of the BTC strategy itself. But being ""justified more or less"" isn't good enough. As investors, we generally want companies that trade at discounted valuations. BTC Yield Is Positive But Dependent On Many Factors One of the KPIs management points to is BTC Yield, or the growth in Bitcoin per share over time. It's formally defined by Semler as ""a KPI that represents, for the period specified (year-to-date), the percentage change in the ratio between our Bitcoin Count and our Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding."" In theory, a high BTC yield, which SMLR has (26.7% YTD and 205.3% in 2024), is a good thing, as it signals that the company is buying BTC faster than it is diluting shareholders, increasing BTC per share. Semler's BTC Yield (Semler Scientific's Investor Relations) Nevertheless, this outcome isn't guaranteed. BTC yield depends on a few variables and also management's expertise in deploying capital. It depends on the timing and pricing of share issuances, pricing of debt offerings, and the healthcare business's ability to generate cash flow for BTC purchases. If Semler can issue shares when its stock is trading at a high premium relative to its BTC holdings, then the BTC yield will look strong. But if BTC rises quickly while Semler's stock underperforms, the company would have to issue more shares per BTC, potentially lowering the BTC yield. Management just needs to be smart with the timing of its purchases and equity raises. It has $362 million remaining in its ATM program, so a lot of dilution could be on the way. Hopefully, it'll be done at a good price. Most of the funds for BTC purchases, as of June 3, have come from ATM issuances and convertible bond issuances, as you can see below. Only 18% came from operating cash flow. Semler's Source Of Funds For BTC Purchases (Semler Scientific's June 2025 Presentation) The Pullback Could Signal A Short-Term Bounce Is Near I'm not going to get into this too much, but in simple terms, SMLR is a volatile stock that has fast upswings and downswings. We're in a downswing period, which suggests a bounce could be near. SMLR Stock Chart (TradingView) At the same time, part of that could depend on how BTC performs, but I'd rather buy SMLR or any other BTC-related stock when the BTC price is relatively low. The Bottom Line On SMLR Stock Semler Scientific may look like a great bargain based on its relative underperformance compared to MSTR and Bitcoin this year, but in reality, I don't see any screaming value. My analysis tells me that it's more or less fairly valued. Meanwhile, the company's high BTC yield isn't guaranteed. Fundamentally, there can be upside if the core business improves (if revenue stabilizes and cash flow returns), but there's not too much clarity about that, and there are no analyst estimates, either. Other upside potential can come from a potential rise in the Bitcoin price, but if you're bullish on Bitcoin at current levels, I do think it would be more efficient to just invest in Bitcoin directly (to avoid overcomplicating things), whether through actual BTC exposure or BTC derivatives. On the other hand, you could buy SMLR stock expecting a short-term bounce potentially, but that's strictly technical-analysis based. At the end of the day, the risk/reward opportunity seems balanced, with the market cap trading at a premium to the company's BTC holdings. Consequently, SMLR stock is a Hold.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4793701-semler-scientific-this-bitcoin-proxy-isnt-as-cheap-as-it-seems?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX","BTC-USD|SMLR",cryptocompare

Traders rushed back in after the asset dipped close to $100,000, feeding a sharp rebound that leaves Bitcoin just 2.8% shy of its record high. A blend of forced liquidations, surging derivatives volume, easing US–China trade tensions and steady on-chain withdrawals is driving the move. Related Reading: Elon Musk ‘Will Do Anything’ To Make XRP King, Tech Mogul Says Heavy Liquidations Shift The Balance According to Coinglass, nearly $203 million in Bitcoin positions were wiped out over the past 24 hours. Of that, $195 million were against shorts. When so many short bets unwind at once, it forces buyers to cover positions, which can send prices spiking. Yet history shows these “short squeezes” can reverse quickly when traders take profits. Based on reports, Bitcoin’s derivatives volume more than doubled, climbing over 110% to $110 billion. Open interest then followed suit, expanding 7.3% to almost $77 billion. These kinds of inflows indicate that new money is accumulating. Both open interest and volume rising tends to indicate enthusiasm—and a willingness to carry through positions with swings. Trade Diplomacy Lifts Risk Assets Talks resumed in London on June 9 between the US and China over tariffs and export rules. Even a hint of progress tends to boost appetite for riskier assets, and Bitcoin isn’t immune. Headlines of smoother trade ties lifted equities earlier this week—and crypto traders moved in tandem. If negotiations hit a snag, though, Bitcoin could slide with global markets. On-Chain Data Shows Steady Accumulation CryptoQuant’s numbers reveal that centralized exchanges have shed 550,000 BTC since July 2024, falling from 1.55 million to about 1.01 million today. As coins leave exchanges, float tightens. At the same time, the Coinbase Premium indicator rose, with US buyers paying more than overseas investors. Santiment also reports renewed accumulation among wallets holding 10–100 BTC. This pattern hints at long-term holding rather than quick trades. Related Reading: Ignore The Trump–Musk Noise: Bitcoin’s Backbone Stays Solid Correlation And Caution Remain When you consider the rally, Bitcoin still dances on the tunes of equity price swings. Futures have mixed bets between bulls and bears, showing portrait-wise signs that certainly not everybody is convinced this run is going to hold. High volatility would tend to wash out weak hands at the slightest hint of trouble, any reversal of risk sentiment, or a sudden macro shock would cost the rally dearly. Optimism is building as analysts talk of fresh all-time highs. Some even eye $150,000 by the end of the year if US debt levels climb further. But sustaining a rally of that magnitude will require more than forced liquidations. Traders will watch derivatives flows, on-chain reserves and trade headlines for signs of real, lasting demand before pushing prices much higher.

US-China Trade Talks: A Glimpse into Diplomatic Progress According to the Walter Bloomberg economic news account via X, the US-China trade talks held recently in London were described as “fruitful” by the U.S. Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick. While the specific details of the discussions remain under wraps for now, this positive descriptor offers a potential signal of progress in navigating the complex economic relationship between the world’s two largest economies. Here’s a quick rundown of the reported details: Location: London Participants: Representatives from the U.S. and China, including reported comments from U.S. Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick. Duration: Approximately six hours for the recent session. Outcome Description: Characterized as “fruitful.” Next Steps: Talks are scheduled to resume on June 10 at 10 a.m. These high-level trade talks are crucial because the economic ties between the United States and China are deeply intertwined, affecting everything from supply chains and manufacturing to technology and financial markets globally. Any signs of de-escalation or constructive dialogue are generally viewed positively by market participants seeking stability. Why Do These Economic Relations Matter for Crypto? You might be wondering, how does a meeting about international economic relations in London relate to your Bitcoin or Ethereum holdings? The connection, while not direct, is significant. The cryptocurrency market, despite its decentralized nature, does not exist in a vacuum. It is increasingly influenced by global liquidity, investor risk appetite, and the overall health of the traditional financial system. Think of it this way: Market Sentiment: Positive developments in major geopolitical or economic spheres, like improved US-China trade relations, can boost overall market confidence. This can lead to increased appetite for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Conversely, tensions can cause uncertainty and drive investors towards perceived safer havens. Global Liquidity: Trade and economic policies between major powers impact global capital flows. Stable and growing economic relations can support global economic growth, potentially increasing the pool of capital available for investment across various asset classes, including crypto. Inflation and Monetary Policy: Trade dynamics can influence inflation rates and, consequently, central bank monetary policies. These policies (like interest rate changes) have a profound impact on market liquidity and investor behavior, directly affecting crypto valuations. Technological Competition: Discussions often touch upon technology, which is intrinsically linked to blockchain and digital innovation. While not explicitly about crypto regulation, these talks set the stage for future international cooperation or competition in digital economies. Therefore, monitoring key geopolitical and economic indicators, such as the outcome of these trade talks , provides valuable context for understanding broader market movements that can affect your crypto portfolio. Challenges and Opportunities in US-China Economic Relations While the term “fruitful” is encouraging, it’s important to acknowledge that significant challenges remain in US-China trade relations. Issues such as trade imbalances, intellectual property rights, technology restrictions, and market access have been points of contention for years. Challenges: Deep-seated structural economic differences. Ongoing technology competition and restrictions (e.g., semiconductors). Trust deficits built over past disputes. Potential for sudden shifts in diplomatic tone. Opportunities presented by ‘Fruitful’ Talks: Reduced uncertainty for businesses and investors. Potential for collaboration on shared global issues (climate change, pandemics). Smoother supply chains, potentially easing inflationary pressures. Improved environment for international investment. For the crypto market impact , reduced global economic uncertainty generally translates to a more stable or positive environment for risk assets. Conversely, a breakdown in talks or renewed tensions could trigger risk-off sentiment, potentially leading to sell-offs in crypto alongside traditional markets. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Investor Given the influence of these high-level trade talks on the global economy and, by extension, the crypto market, what should a crypto investor do? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Pay attention to major geopolitical and macroeconomic news, not just crypto-specific headlines. Understand how events like these trade talks can serve as macro indicators. Contextualize Market Movements: If the crypto market sees significant volatility, consider if major global economic or political events could be contributing factors alongside crypto-native news. Assess Risk Appetite: Developments in economic relations between major powers often signal shifts in global risk appetite. A positive shift might favor growth assets like crypto, while negative news could indicate a move towards safer assets. Diversify (Wisely): While crypto is a specific asset class, understanding its correlation with broader markets during different economic climates is key. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket based solely on crypto news; consider the wider economic backdrop. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term market reactions to news events can be sharp, the long-term trajectory of crypto is driven by its underlying technology and adoption. Use macro news for context, but maintain a long-term perspective on your core investment thesis. The fact that talks are resuming indicates an ongoing process. The outcome of future sessions will continue to be relevant for understanding the global economic climate and its potential flow-through effects on financial markets, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. Concluding Thoughts: Navigating the Interconnected Global Economy The report of “fruitful” US-China trade talks in London, as noted by U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, is a positive signal in the complex landscape of international economic relations . While not directly about Bitcoin or blockchain, these discussions are a vital part of the global economy that ultimately influences market sentiment, liquidity, and investor behavior – all factors that contribute to the ebb and flow of the crypto market. Keeping an eye on these high-level trade talks provides crucial context for any crypto investor looking to understand the broader forces at play beyond the immediate crypto ecosystem. The interconnectedness of global finance means that progress, or lack thereof, in diplomatic and economic dialogues between major powers will continue to have a tangible crypto market impact .

2025-06-10T13:15:15,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Is BTC Ready to Break its All-Time High?","Bitcoin remains technically bullish, with strong buyer interest evident after the recent liquidity sweep around the $100K mark. A breakout above $111K would likely trigger aggressive upside continuation. However, short-term volatility and potential resistance should be expected as the price navigates this critical zone. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart BTC has recently swept a critical liquidity zone just around the $100K mark, triggering a strong, impulsive rally that reflects significant demand entering the market. This surge has propelled the price to its all-time high of $111K, signaling renewed bullish momentum. A key area of buy-side liquidity lies just above the $111K ATH, making it an attractive target for institutional and “smart money” participants. If bullish momentum holds and buyers manage to breach this level, a sharp move higher, potentially driven by a short squeeze, could follow. However, this zone also overlaps with a likely area of profit-taking and increased supply, which may temporarily slow or cap upward momentum. While a bullish breakout appears imminent, a minor pullback or short-term correction cannot be ruled out. At present, BTC remains range-bound between $100K and $111K, with the breakout direction likely determining the next macro trend. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, Bitcoin has seen a strong influx of buyers around the $100K level, leading to a breakout above a recently formed bullish flag pattern. This breakout confirms the continuation of the upward trend. Currently, the price action is approaching a 4-hour Order Block, a key area where supply is expected to re-enter the market. If bulls can reclaim this zone and sustain momentum, BTC could make a swift move toward price discovery and a new ATH. That said, a short-term rejection or a pullback to retest the breakout level is still a viable scenario before the next leg up. For now, Bitcoin is consolidating within a tighter $105K–$111K range on the 4-hour chart. This consolidation phase could serve as a launchpad for the next impulsive rally. On-chain Analysis By ShayanMarkets As Bitcoin hovers just below its all-time high of $111K, a closer look at futures market data, particularly the BTC/USDT liquidation heatmap on Binance, offers critical insights into potential price movements. It reveals two major liquidity clusters: one positioned above the $111K level and another just below $100K. These zones are situated near the current price and represent prime areas where smart money may aim to trigger liquidations of overleveraged retail positions. A decisive move beyond either threshold could ignite a liquidation cascade, accelerating price action in that direction. Given the prevailing bullish sentiment and broader market structure, a breakout above the $111K resistance appears increasingly likely in the mid-term. Such a move would not only confirm market strength but could also fuel momentum toward a fresh all-time high.

However, last month, 22 more companies joined in, bringing the total to 126. Together, they now hold over 819,000 Bitcoin. While corporate treasuries keep loading up on BTC. Here’s what you missed overnight and what to watch today. European Firm Goes All-In on Bitcoin In Europe, the Paris-based Blockchain Group is going all-in. They’re planning to raise €300 million (about $340 million) just to buy more bitcoin. It’s one of the biggest bitcoin moves from a European company, showing how much crypto fever has gripped the corporate world. Matthew Sigel from VanEck says this trend is not just a one-off. He points out that big names like MicroStrategy and Cantor Equity Partners have a combined war chest of $76 billion. That’s more than half of what’s locked up in all bitcoin ETFs today. It’s also way more than the money flowing into these funds over the last 16 months. Clearly, companies are serious about owning bitcoin for the long haul. BlackRock’s Bitcoin Bet Breaks Records BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust is also making headlines. It shot past $70 billion in assets in just under a year, a record pace that left even gold funds in the dust. The trust alone saw $2.7 billion in trading volume in just one day. That’s a massive vote of confidence in bitcoin’s staying power. Eyes on Inflation and the Fed Investors are also watching the U.S. Consumer Price Index numbers coming out on June 11 and the big Federal Reserve meeting on June 18 . If inflation picks up or the Fed hints at new policies, it could be another push for bitcoin’s price. Bitcoin Eying For $130K Meanwhile, veteran trader Merlijn The Trader says that Bitcoin may have officially entered the final phase of its parabolic run. After staying quiet for months and breaking out of tough spots, the price has jumped over $100,000. Merlijn says this last push usually leads to crazy gains, then people doubting it, and finally, late buyers jumping in because they’re scared to miss out. If this happens again, Bitcoin might soon hit $130,000 faster than people think.

2025-06-10T13:07:40,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Ark CEO Cathie Wood Sees $1.5M BTC Within 5 Years — Is She Right?","Bitcoin is once again capturing headlines, not just for its price rally, but for a staggering new forecast. Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood said in a recent podcast that Bitcoin could climb to $1.5 million in the next five years. That’s more than a 15x gain from current levels near $109,336, and it’s sparking fresh interest among retail and institutional investors alike. Wood made her case during an episode of The Diary of a CEO, emphasizing that Bitcoin is evolving into a “new asset class”, one she likens to the early days of equity markets in the 1600s. Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood explains why she thinks #Bitcoin will multiply by 15x in the next five years. pic.twitter.com/rn8YER75jh — Crypto Aman (@cryptoamanclub) June 9, 2025 Her forecast isn’t based on hype, but rather on fundamentals: scarcity, security, and growing institutional interest. With nearly 20 million out of 21 million BTC already mined, supply is drying up—making each remaining coin more valuable by design. Scarcity, Security, and Institutional Trust; Bitcoin Supported? Bitcoin’s scarcity is central to its appeal. Unlike fiat currencies that can be printed endlessly, Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, and around 94% has already been mined. At today’s prices, the remaining 1 million+ coins are worth over $100 billion. As availability shrinks, upward price pressure builds—especially if demand continues to rise. Wood also highlighted Bitcoin’s impeccable security record: its base layer hasn’t been hacked since its inception in 2009. This unmatched track record makes it one of the most resilient systems in global finance. It’s a point of confidence for institutions allocating capital, especially as crypto-related cybercrime draws regulatory scrutiny. Bitcoin price: $109,336 24H trading volume: $57.9B Market cap: $2.17T Circulating supply: 19.87M BTC These fundamentals, according to Wood, underpin Bitcoin’s shift from an alternative currency into a strategic investment class. Technical Set-Up: Is Bitcoin Ready to Break $110K? Beyond macro tailwinds, Bitcoin price prediction seems bullish on the charts. After reclaiming the $106,737 breakout zone and the 50-period EMA near $106,339, BTC is now consolidating just below $110,668, a key resistance level. Price is moving inside a rising parallel channel, with a series of spinning top candles suggesting a pause, but not a reversal. The MACD remains bullish, though its slope is flattening. A confirmed breakout could accelerate the next leg up. Trade Setup: Entry: Above $110,700 Target: $112,700, then $115,103 Stop-loss: Below $108,600 Conclusion Between Wood’s $1.5M long-term call and the bullish near-term structure, Bitcoin’s case for a breakout is strengthening. As long as BTC stays above $108,627, technicals favor the bulls—and institutional momentum may do the rest. BTC Bull Token Nears $8M Cap as 58% APY Staking Attracts Last-Minute Buyers With Bitcoin trading near $102K, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The project has now raised $7,032,776.85 out of its $8,011,104 cap, leaving less than $1 million before the next token price hike. The current price of $0.002555 is expected to increase once the cap is hit. BTC Bull Token links its value directly to Bitcoin through two core mechanisms: BTC Airdrops reward holders, with presale participants receiving priority.

2025-06-10T13:03:08,"Crypto Price Analysis 6-10: BITCOIN: BTC, ETHEREUM: ETH, SOLANA: SOL, LITECOIN: LTC, UNISWAP: UNI, FILECOIN: FIL","The crypto market shot upwards as Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies overcame initial sluggishness to register substantial increases and trade in positive territory. BTC was trading around $105,000 on Monday before picking up momentum and rising to $107,000. The flagship cryptocurrency continued pushing higher, crossing $110,000 before registering a marginal decline and moving to its current level. BTC is up nearly 4% in the past 24 hours, trading around $109,390. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) rallied after reclaiming $2,500, with the price up over 7%, trading around $2,667. Ripple (XRP) is up over 2%, while Solana (SOL) is up over 5%, trading at $157. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up nearly 6%, trading at $0.191, while Cardano (ADA) is up 6%, trading at $0.697. Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Toncoin (TON) , Hedera (HBAR) , Litecoin (LTC) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered substantial increases. Crypto CEO Accused Of Laundering Funds Linked To Sanctioned Russian Banks Federal prosecutors have charged the founder of a US-based crypto payments firm with allegedly operating a sophisticated international money laundering scheme to move over $500 million linked to sanctioned Russian banks and other entities. According to reports, Iurii Gugnin, a Russian national living in Manhattan, was arrested and arraigned on Monday and ordered to be held without bail pending trial. Gugnin faces a 22-count indictment and is accused of wire and bank fraud, violating US sanctions and export controls, money laundering, and failing to implement legally required anti-money laundering protocols. Assistant Attorney General Eisenberg stated, “The defendant is charged with turning a cryptocurrency company into a covert pipeline for dirty money, moving over half a billion dollars through the U.S. financial system to aid sanctioned Russian banks and help Russian end-users acquire sensitive U.S. technology.” Prosecutors alleged that Gugnin used his companies, Evita Investments, and Evita Pay, to process over $500 million in payments while concealing their origin, nature, and purpose. The list of clients included individuals and businesses linked to sanctioned Russian banks and financial institutions like Sberbank, VTB Bank, Sovcombank, Tinkoff, and the state-owned nuclear energy firm Rosatom. UK Appoints Crypto Specialist To Recover Funds From Bankruptcy Cases The UK Insolvency Service has appointed a crypto intelligence specialist to help recover crypto from criminal and bankruptcy cases. According to a statement from the Insolvency Service, Andrew Small, a former police investigator with a background in economic crimes and offenses, will lead efforts to locate and recover crypto assets. The appointment comes as insolvency cases in the UK have increased by 420% over the past five years. The estimated value of crypto assets has also significantly increased during the same time period. “There has been a rapid rise in crypto ownership in the UK, and alongside that, we’ve seen a similar rise in crypto asset ownership in bankruptcy cases. Crypto is very much a recoverable asset.” The UK’s Insolvency Service has been tasked with recovering money and assets from individuals and companies in insolvency cases and returning as much of the funds owed to creditors. Small will provide specialist knowledge about the different types of cryptocurrencies available and the associated technologies available to buy, sell, and store them. Neil Freebury, the head of intelligence at the Insolvency Service, expects Small to enhance collaboration and strengthen outcomes for investigators working on crypto asset ownership cases. Freebury stated, “His appointment will help our investigators dealing with cases where crypto asset ownership is a factor.” Lawmakers Propose Amendment to Crypto Market Structure Bill US lawmakers on the House Financial Services are expected to convene for a markup hearing on Tuesday, where they will consider a cryptocurrency market structure bill, which will be amended to add additional protection for blockchain developers. According to a statement released before the hearing, Committee Chair French Hill introduced an amendment to the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act 2025. The amendment focuses on the treatment of certain non-controlling blockchain developers. It proposes that under potential market structure law, blockchain developers or service providers will not be considered money transmitters or be subject to their registration requirements. The hearing will also include a discussion and vote for amendments to the CLARITY Act. Meanwhile, the Senate is expected to vote on the GENIUS Act, legislation to regulate stablecoins. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he wants the bill to be “wrapped up” this week. According to Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal, stablecoin legislation has made substantial progress thanks to bipartisan support. “I think stablecoin legislation has made incredible progress, in large part because I think there is a fairly consistent bipartisan consensus that it’s in the United States’ interest to have sensible rules for stablecoins. A market structure bill is equally important for long-term stability and growth.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) overcame a sluggish start to the week to register a healthy 4% lead and crossed $110,000 on Monday, ultimately settling at $110,251. However, the flagship cryptocurrency is trading in the red during the ongoing session, down nearly 1% and trading around $109,310. BTC’s move past $110,000 on Monday was the first time it crossed the level in two weeks as markets become hopeful about the outcome of ongoing talks between the US and China. Monday’s surge also saw short positions liquidated. BTC isn’t far from its all-time high, with market experts predicting a new all-time high if current sentiment persists. Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, stated, “Bitcoin breaking above $110,000 for the first time in two weeks signals renewed bullish momentum after a period of consolidation. If BTC can hold this level, it may set the stage for a fresh push toward the $120,000 range.” However, more conservative voices predict a correction before a push higher, expecting CPI data to trigger more volatility in the market. The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers are due for Tuesday, with markets fearing Trump’s tariffs could add pressure on an already volatile market. Analysts have predicted the CPI to rise 0.3% month-over-month and 2.3% year-over-year. Meanwhile, Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, is expected to rise 0.3% month-over-month and 2.9% year-over-year. A jump in inflation could reduce the possibility of a Fed rate cut. Private wealth manager Swissblock stated in a post on X, “Bitcoin, what is the plan? Inflation data in the week ahead could unleash volatility. The bulls are slowly rebuilding their structure and regrouping, and are eager to flip the game. First steps are in, but a short-term test of the lower range ($104k) looks likely.” However, the pullback is expected to be temporary, with BTC bulls still in control. BTC traded in positive territory the previous weekend, rising 0.69% on Saturday and almost 1% on Sunday to cross $105,000 and settle at $105,779. The price plunged to an intraday low of $103,768 on Monday before recovering to register a marginal increase and settle at $105,902. BTC was back in the red Tuesday, falling 0.44% to $105,436. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price dropped almost 1%, slipping below $105,000 and settling at $104,752. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC plunged 3%, falling to an intraday low of $100,424 before ultimately settling at $101,614. Source: TradingView The price recovered on Friday, rising nearly 3% to recoup its losses and settle at $104,378. BTC continued pushing higher on Saturday, rising over 1% to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,575. Buyers retained control on Sunday despite waning bullish sentiment as BTC registered a marginal increase to end the weekend at $105,784. BTC got off to a sluggish start on Monday. However, sentiment picked up as it surged over 4% to cross the 20-day SMA and $110,000 and settle at $110,251. The current session sees BTC down nearly 1%, trading around $109,110. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) registered a dramatic increase on Monday as it surged to an intraday high of $2,694. However, it fell short of the $2,700 mark and is marginally down during the ongoing session as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency faces an uphill battle to overcome $2,700, a crucial resistance. If tETH overcomes this level, it could rally to $3,000. However, if the bears reverse the positive sentiment, ETH risks a drop to $2,400 or lower. Meanwhile, Ethereum ETFs continue to register healthy inflows. The investment products have recorded inflows totaling $857 million since May 16, with analysts predicting them to cross the $1 billion milestone shortly. The ETFs recorded over $25 million in inflows on June 6 alone to cap off a third week of trading in the green. Marcin Kazmierczak, co-founder and COO of Redstone, stated, “ETH’s momentum appears driven by several converging factors: institutional ETF flows showing renewed interest in ETH products, growing anticipation around Ethereum’s roadmap upgrades.” Optimism around the asset has also been boosted by the Pectra upgrade, with Luke Nolan, senior Ethereum research associate at CoinShares, stating, “I think a few factors are lining up in ETH's favor. Firstly, we had the Pectra upgrade on May 7, which included a number of changes to the Ethereum protocol. None of them were that major, but they indicated stepping stones for further scaling, which has been a major bottleneck for a while on Ethereum. I also think sometimes a small narrative is enough to help drive positivity.” ETH price action was mixed the previous weekend, registering a marginal decline on Saturday and then rising 0.44% on Sunday to settle at $2,539. The price fell to an intraday low of $2,476 on Monday before recovering to register an increase of nearly 3% to cross the 20-day SMA and $2,600 and settle at $2,607.

Uniswap (UNI) Price Analysis Uniswap (UNI) has jumped nearly 14% over the past 24 hours as the token surged after breaking out of its months-long consolidation phase, with analysts predicting a significant rally. Trading volumes are also reaching record levels as sentiment around the token flips to bullish.

2025-06-10T13:00:59,"DeFi Developers: SEC Chairman Atkins Offers Crucial Clarity on Liability","BitcoinWorld DeFi Developers: SEC Chairman Atkins Offers Crucial Clarity on Liability Are you a DeFi developer , investor, or simply interested in the future of decentralized finance? Recent comments from a key regulatory figure have shed important light on a critical aspect of the industry: liability. Understanding the potential legal landscape is paramount for anyone involved in this rapidly evolving space. What Did SEC Chairman Paul Atkins Say About DeFi Liability ? In a significant development for the decentralized finance (DeFi) community, former SEC Chairman Paul Atkins recently weighed in on the complex issue of regulatory responsibility. Speaking at a roundtable discussion aptly titled “DeFi and the American Spirit,” Atkins shared insights that resonate deeply with the core principles of DeFi. According to a report from the DeFi Education Fund via X, Atkins emphasized the strong connection between the fundamental values underpinning DeFi and traditional American ideals. He stated that the American values of economic liberty, property rights, and innovation are intrinsically linked to the “DNA of DeFi.” Perhaps the most impactful statement for DeFi developers came when Atkins addressed the potential legal exposure they face. He specifically noted that, in his view, developers building decentralized protocols should not be held liable under existing securities laws for actions taken by third parties utilizing those protocols. This distinction is crucial for fostering innovation without stifling it under the weight of potential, uncontrollable liabilities. Why Is Clarity on DeFi Developer Liability So Important? The question of who is responsible when something goes wrong in DeFi – whether it’s a hack, a rug pull, or a protocol failure – is one of the most debated topics in the regulatory world. The decentralized nature of many DeFi protocols makes applying traditional legal frameworks, especially securities laws , incredibly challenging. Think about it: Decentralization: Protocols often operate autonomously based on code, with no single entity in control. Global Access: Users from anywhere in the world can interact with these protocols. Third-Party Use: The developer creates the code, but users and other third parties deploy capital and interact in ways the original developer may not foresee or control. Without clear guidance, DeFi developers face significant uncertainty. This uncertainty can lead to: Hesitation to build and innovate. Relocation of development teams to jurisdictions with clearer rules. Increased legal costs and compliance burdens. Comments like those from Paul Atkins , even though he is a former chairman, contribute to the ongoing conversation and highlight a perspective that could be favorable to the growth and development of the DeFi ecosystem within the United States. His view on limiting DeFi liability for developers based on third-party actions provides a potential pathway for regulatory thinking. How Do Securities Laws Intersect with DeFi? The application of securities laws to the crypto space is a major point of contention globally. In the U.S., the SEC primarily uses the Howey Test to determine if an asset or activity constitutes an investment contract, which would fall under their jurisdiction as a security. The challenge with DeFi is multifaceted: Is the token a security? Many DeFi protocols involve tokens, and their classification is often debated. Is the protocol itself an unregistered exchange or broker? Some DeFi platforms facilitate trading or lending, raising questions about whether they function similarly to regulated entities. Who is the responsible party? If a protocol is decentralized, who is liable if it’s deemed to violate securities laws? Is it the initial developers, current token holders, users, or none of the above? Paul Atkins’ comments specifically address the third point, suggesting that the initial developers shouldn’t automatically inherit liability for how others use the deployed code. This perspective aligns with the idea that code, in itself, might be viewed differently from a centrally controlled financial product. The American Spirit and DeFi: A Connection Highlighted by Paul Atkins The “DeFi and the American Spirit” roundtable title itself is telling. By linking DeFi to American values, proponents aim to frame the technology not as a threat, but as a modern manifestation of principles that have driven American prosperity and innovation for centuries. Paul Atkins highlighting economic liberty, property rights, and innovation suggests a view that DeFi, at its core, embodies these ideals: Economic Liberty: DeFi allows individuals to participate in financial activities without intermediaries, promoting financial freedom. Property Rights: Users have direct control over their digital assets via private keys. Innovation: DeFi is a frontier of financial technology, constantly developing new protocols and use cases. This framing seeks to build a bridge between the traditional regulatory world and the decentralized future, suggesting that regulation should aim to preserve these core values rather than inadvertently suppress them by holding DeFi developers overly responsible for uncontrollable third-party actions. Key Takeaways for the DeFi Community While Paul Atkins is no longer the sitting SEC Chairman, his views carry weight given his past leadership role and continued involvement in financial policy discussions. His comments provide valuable insight into how someone with deep regulatory experience views the complexities of DeFi. Here are some actionable insights: Advocacy Matters: The “DeFi and the American Spirit” event and similar initiatives show that engaging with policymakers and articulating the principles of DeFi is crucial. Clarity is Key: The industry desperately needs clearer regulatory guidelines, especially regarding DeFi liability and the application of securities laws . Focus on Decentralization: For developers, designing protocols that are truly decentralized can potentially strengthen the argument against central control and associated liability. Atkins’ statement serves as a hopeful signal for many DeFi developers navigating an uncertain regulatory environment. It suggests that there are influential voices within policy circles who understand the unique challenges and potential benefits of decentralized technologies and advocate for a nuanced approach that doesn’t unfairly burden those building the underlying infrastructure. In Conclusion: A Step Towards Regulatory Understanding? The comments from former SEC Chairman Paul Atkins represent a significant contribution to the ongoing dialogue about regulating decentralized finance. By emphasizing that DeFi developers should not be held liable under securities laws for the actions of third parties, he articulates a principle that is vital for allowing innovation to flourish in the DeFi space. Linking DeFi to fundamental American values like economic liberty further strengthens the argument for a regulatory approach that understands and accommodates decentralization rather than trying to force-fit it into outdated frameworks. While the path to clear and comprehensive DeFi regulation is still long, statements like these offer crucial clarity and hope for the future of decentralized finance.

2025-06-10T12:57:34,"Owning More Than 10,000 XRP Today Is already a Luxury Few Can Afford: Pundit","Crypto founder Edoardo Farina is reiterating his long-held view that 99% of XRP holders risk being priced out as inflation and economic pressures rise. In a recent disclosure , he claimed that owning more than 10,000 XRP is quickly becoming a luxury out of reach for the average person. He argued that XRP holders are increasingly forced to sell off their assets to cover basic living expenses as inflation rises and fiat currencies weaken.For context, with XRP worth $2.30 per coin today, acquiring 10,000 XRP requires a significant financial commitment of $23,000. This is a major hurdle in a global landscape where many people are in debt or living paycheck to paycheck.Moreover, data from XRP’s rich list further emphasizes this point. Out of more than 6.55 million XRP wallet addresses, fewer than 4% hold at least 10,000 XRP. In contrast, over 5 million wallets contain 500 XRP or fewer.Specifically, only 166,258 wallets hold between 10,000 and 25,000 XRP, while 159,566 hold between 5,000 and 10,000 XRP.As a result, market commentators like Farina from Alpha Lions Academy stress the strategic importance of holding 10,000 XRP. They argue that reaching this threshold could pave the way for significant financial gains. https://twitter.com/edward_farina/status/193218902671644309999% of XRP Holders May Be Left BehindFarina initially estimated that 95% of XRP holders would eventually be priced out. However, his latest video warned that this figure could rise to 99% .He cites rising inflation, the declining purchasing power of fiat currencies, and global economic instability as key factors driving this shift. “We’re already seeing people around the world selling their XRP just to buy groceries,” he said, adding, “It’s not about luxury anymore; it’s about survival.” According to Farina, the apparent surge in asset prices may not entirely reflect growth in crypto value, but rather a collapse in the purchasing power of traditional fiat currencies. He notes that it now takes over $20,000 to acquire what used to be a $5,000 XRP stack. “Is Bitcoin really going to $112,000, or is the U.S. dollar just becoming worthless?” he asked. Farina often criticizes Bitcoin’s price surge as artificial and misleading, claiming it’s designed to trap retail investors and use them as exit liquidity.Don’t Sell, Adapt InsteadMeanwhile, Farina strongly urges XRP holders to seek alternative sources of income rather than selling their crypto holdings. He recommends side hustles, digital work, or even relocating to more affordable countries, something he did by moving to Greece. “If you truly believe XRP has long-term value, selling it now for groceries is exactly what they want you to do,” Farina said. “Think differently. Protect your assets.” His message is that the value of XRP could rise much higher in the future, rewarding today’s steadfast holders. He discourages premature selling, warning that the window for affordable accumulation is closing fast, and many risk missing what he believes is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity with XRP.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/10/owning-more-than-10000-xrp-today-is-already-a-luxury-few-can-afford-pundit/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=owning-more-than-10000-xrp-today-is-already-a-luxury-few-can-afford-pundit,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|XRP","Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today",cryptocompare

2025-06-10T12:53:02,"Major Shiba Inu (SHIB) Indicator Hits a New ATH: Details Here","TL;DR A key SHIB metric reached a new all-time high, underscoring strong adoption and investor optimism. Shiba Inu’s Shibarium continues to make headlines by processing millions of transactions daily and undergoing a significant upgrade. The New Record LUCIE, the pseudonymous marketing strategist of Shibarium, recently revealed that the total number of wallets holding Shiba Inu (SHIB) has surged to a new all-time high of over 1.5 million. SHIB HOLDERS HIT NEW ATH! 1,511,101 wallets now hold $SHIB — that’s 0.011% of global population. The army is growing. The mission is alive. pic.twitter.com/DNI9LhgpCt — (@LucieSHIB) June 9, 2025 The development signals a growing interest and user engagement. It also indicates increasing demand, which could play a role in future price growth. As of the moment, though, SHIB is far from its peak levels. Despite its 4% daily resurgence, the price remains 17% down over the past 30 days. Shiba Inu isn’t the only cryptocurrency seeing its number of investors rise to a new record. As CryptoPotato reported , the number of bitcoin (BTC) holders recently exploded to almost 55.4 million. Ethereum (ETH) leads the pack with more than 148 million holders, while Shiba Inu’s biggest rival – Dogecoin (DOGE) – has almost eight million. Breaking Down the Stats As mentioned above, the data shows that the total number of wallets holding some amount of SHIB is over 1.5 million, which, according to LUCIE, represents 0.011% of the global population. However, we should make a vital disclaimer that a single individual can have multiple wallets. This means the exact number of holders most certainly does not correspond to the figure, and it should be less.

Bitcoin Adoption Wave Increases Amid Scarcity, and Sky-High Predictions All of these reflect the growing appetite for Bitcoin and crypto generally in the UK. Digital asset companies are flooding capital markets to raise funds for large-scale Bitcoin acquisitions, spurred by the cryptocurrency’s rally to a record $111,965 in May. The surge, up over 50% from early April, has ignited a wave of listings and mergers as firms race to secure funding while investor appetite remains strong.

2025-06-10T12:49:55,"Will Bitcoin continue rising? Analyst eyes breakout as demand outpaces supply","Bitcoin price could be on the cusp of a strong bullish breakout, potentially reaching $143,000 after forming a cup-and-handle pattern, as market participants anticipate a supply squeeze. Bitcoin ( BTC ) was trading at $109,860 on Tuesday, up nearly 10% from its lowest point this month and 50% above its April low. Santiment data indicates that Bitcoin could face a supply squeeze as demand rises. The supply of Bitcoin on exchanges has dropped to 1.18 million, its lowest level since December 2017. This supply peaked at 3.25 million in March 2020 and has been in freefall since. The decline has accelerated this year, with supply at 1.53 million on January 1. Bitcoin supply on exchanges | Source: Santiment This trend suggests that more investors are moving their coins to self-custody wallets—a sign that they don’t intend to sell. Meanwhile, recent data shows that demand is rising faster than new coins are being mined. Only about 450 new Bitcoins are mined each day, or roughly 3,150 per week. Bitcoin miners now hold 1.7 million coins, the lowest level since 2010. At the same time, companies are buying thousands of coins per week, with Strategy leading the charge. Other top purchasers include Metaplanet, Twenty One, KULR Technology, and MicroCloud Hologram.

2025-06-10T12:49:53,"Why Is Crypto Up Today? – June 10, 2025","Over the past 24 hours, the crypto market has finally turned green again thanks to the institutional inflows and easing concerns around US regulations. 98 of the top 100 coins have seen their prices increase over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency market capitalization has increased by 1.8% to $3.54 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $126 billion, back to its typical levels. TL;DR: The market has market a notable increase, with 98 of the top 100 coins green; BTC moves towards an attempt to test the $111,814 level; ETH is the top 10’s highest gainer, with the coin hitting several milestones; Investors are watching the US-China trade talks as they enter the second day; US spot BTC ETFs record notable inflow, spot ETH ETFs see sixteen days of inflows; The rally seems sustainable for now, but the market is currently highly sensitive to the ongoing macroeconomic developments. Crypto Winners & Losers All top 10 coins per market cap have seen their prices increase over the past 24 hours. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) has increased by 3.7%, breaking through the $106,000, $107,000, and $108,000 levels. It’s currently trading at $109,357. Error: Invalid date format. Please use YYYY-MM-DD.

Moreover, only two of the top 100 coins have seen their prices decrease at the time of writing. LEO Token (LEO) and XDC Network (XDC) are down 2.2% and 0.9% to $9.09 and $0.06071, respectively. On the other hand, Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) is the category’s best performer, having appreciated 18.2% to $1.24. Eight other coins saw double-digit increases. Notably, investors are now focused on the US–China trade talks in London, as they resume for a second day on Tuesday. These talks could easily impact the crypto and stocks market both. Reigniting Bullish Positioning Sergei Gorev, Head of Risk at YouHodler , argues that BTC quotes are “in a state of uncertainty.” Many global traders are gradually shifting from the US dollar to more risky assets, including crypto. At the same time, the BTC chart shows “erratic” price movements, and there is a possibility of a local price hike. “There is a ‘Head and Shoulders’ picture, which, when implemented in its scenario, can lead to a correction in the price of BTC to the level of $92,000,” Gorev argued. Source: Sergei Gorev, TradingView According to James Toledano, Chief Operating Officer at Unity Wallet , persistent ETF inflows and continuing regulatory progress bolster upward crypto momentum. BTC’s rebound from $100,000 on 5 June “speaks to its resilience” and “robustness,” he says. Two key factors power this: institutional inflows into spot ETFs and easing concerns around US regulations. “The fact that the markets did not react to major macro factors like the U.S. losing its AAA credit rating also demonstrates growing investor confidence,” Toledano says. Moreover, we could see a US Federal Reserve rate cut as early as July. The expectations “have reignited bullish positioning.” A Federal Reserve dovish shift, particularly a summer rate cut of between 25-50 basis points, would likely accelerate BTC’s climb by making risk assets more attractive, the COO argues. This is certainly something to keep an eye on. “Together, these elements have restored momentum after Friday’s dip, suggesting continued institutional appetite and improved investor confidence are the primary forces driving today’s recovery.” However, BTC will face strong resistance around $112,000–$125,000. Here, profit-taking could trigger temporary pullbacks before any new highs are tested, Toledano concluded. Levels & Events to Watch Next BTC currently trades at $109,357, the nearest to the all-time high it’s been in days. For context, the coin hit the ATH of $111,814 on 22 May. Notably, BTC also hit the intraday high of $110,282 just hours ago. Breaking $111,848 would lead to testing additional resistance levels at $115,103 and $118,358. Bitcoin’s price is held up by the rising investor interest, with over 80 publicly traded companies now holding BTC. Governments are also increasingly (deliberating) adding the coin to the coffers.

2025-06-10T12:47:55,"Traders Flee Dollar for BTC, but Technicals Warn of Pullback to $92K: Analyst","Bitcoin’s recent volatility has left traders torn between optimism and caution, as shifting global capital flows collide with conflicting BTC technical signals pointing towards a pullback. Key Takeaways: Traders are shifting from the US dollar to Bitcoin, but technical charts signal a possible pullback to $92,000. Bitcoin’s supply on exchanges has dropped sharply by 30%. Short-term indicators show mixed momentum with signs of overbought conditions. In a recent note shared with Cryptonews.com, Sergei Gorev, Head of Risk at YouHodler, noted that “BTC quotes are currently in a state of uncertainty.” He explained that while “many global traders are gradually withdrawing from the US currency and shifting to more risky assets, including cryptocurrencies,” which supports Bitcoin’s price, the charts are telling a different story. BTC Flashes Volatility as Gorev Warns of Pullback Gorev pointed to increased instability in BTC’s movements, warning that “the price on the BTC chart is behaving extremely erratically, and there is currently a possibility of a local price hike.” However, he flagged the emergence of a “Head and Shoulders” pattern, often considered a bearish signal in technical analysis. “When implemented in its scenario, [it] can lead to a correction in the price of BTC to the level of $92,000 per 1 BTC,” Gorev said. Gold, meanwhile, continues to benefit from dollar weakness. Gorev highlighted an “Inverted head and shoulders” pattern in gold’s chart, noting that “we may see new highs in gold metal prices, reaching up to $3,700 per ounce” if the setup plays out. Last week, analysts at Bitfinex said Bitcoin could climb to $115,000 or higher by early July, with institutional demand and ETF inflows driving the rally. “In a bullish scenario, driven by strong institutional interest and ETF inflows, Bitcoin could touch $115,000 or higher by early July 2025,” the analysts said. Meanwhile, the available Bitcoin supply has fallen sharply , setting the stage for potential price surges as institutional demand builds, according to Sygnum Bank’s latest Monthly Investment Outlook for June 2025. Over the past 18 months, liquid Bitcoin supply has dropped by 30%, driven by rising institutional adoption and an increase in acquisition vehicles such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the report stated. In total, one million BTC have moved off exchanges during this period — typically a bullish signal, as coins are often withdrawn for long-term holding. Bitcoin Shows Strength with Cautious Signs of Overbought Conditions Bitcoin is currently trading around $109,510 with mixed signals across multiple timeframes. On the 2-hour chart, BTC shows strong momentum as it nears the upper Bollinger Band ($111,308), indicating potential short-term overbought conditions. The RSI on this timeframe is approaching the overbought zone at 69.86, just below the critical 70 level, suggesting cautious optimism but warning that a pullback or consolidation could occur soon. The MACD histogram is positive, with the MACD line above the signal line, confirming upward momentum. On the 30-minute chart, Bitcoin is showing signs of consolidation after a recent surge. Bollinger Bands have tightened slightly, reflecting reduced volatility, with price resting close to the middle band ($109,478). The RSI at 54.95 shows neutral momentum, indicating a balance between buyers and sellers. The MACD on this timeframe is slightly bearish, with the signal line above the MACD line, hinting at a short-term pause or minor correction.

2025-06-10T12:45:41,"CleanSpark's Bitcoin Mining Boom - 50 EH/s Target May Not Solve Profitability","Summary I rate CleanSpark as a 'Hold' due to rising operational risks, especially from increasing electricity costs that may pressure margins in 2025. CLSK's strategy to fund operations by selling mined bitcoin, rather than issuing new equity, should limit shareholder dilution and align value with its bitcoin treasury. Despite a growing hash rate and bitcoin treasury, higher production costs and volatile bitcoin prices create uncertainty for the company's profitability and valuation. With CLSK trading at a 2x premium to its bitcoin holdings, investors must weigh if the operational risks justify paying above the value of its bitcoin assets. CleanSpark ( CLSK ) may be moving into a more challenging environment as the cost to operate may continue to pressure margins going forward. One of the major factors that may impact CleanSpark in 2025 is the cost of electricity, particularly as load demand is increasing across the cloud services providers [CSPs] for data center capacity. Given that CLSK shares are relatively correlated to the direction of bitcoin, an investor must weigh the added operational risk when holding CLSK shares and whether it's worth the premium over CleanSpark's bitcoin treasury. Given the potential operating risks at hand, I am rating CLSK shares with a HOLD rating with no price target. CleanSpark Operations For May 2025, CleanSpark operated at an average of 42.5EH/s while closing the month at 45.6EH/s, bringing daily production to 22.39 bitcoin/day. Driving potential growth going forward, CleanSpark secured an additional 72MW of contracted power, bringing its total capacity to 987MW. Looking ahead to June 2025, management anticipates that CleanSpark can achieve 50EH/s as part of its long-term strategy to scale. In total, CleanSpark produced 694 bitcoin and sold 293.5 bitcoin in the month of May 2025 for a net treasury increase of 400.5 bitcoin. The average selling price for the month of May 2025 was $102,254/coin for a total estimated revenue of $30mm for the month. In April 2025 , CleanSpark sold 401.39 bitcoin at $90,084/coin for a total estimated revenue of $36mm. Unlike competing bitcoin mining operators like MARA Holdings (MARA), management indicated in q2'25 that they intend on keeping CleanSpark a pure play bitcoin mining operator. In the q2'25 Earnings Update , management indicated that they intend to utilize a proportion of monthly bitcoin mining to finance operations, resulting in the expectation of no further dilution from equity issuances. This can be a positive turn for CleanSpark as it allows the organization to manage risk over time, similar to how investment advisors average in and out of positions over time. This may be a prudent approach to managing operations given the volatility risk bitcoin poses to a ""HODL"" strategy. TradingView Looking ahead to eq3'25, CleanSpark may be faced with margin pressure as a result of higher electricity costs. The Wall Street Journal anticipates that power costs in the US may face upward pressure going into the summer. I had argued in my previous report covering Golar LNG ( GLNG ) that natural gas prices may increase throughout the summer as a result of increased utilization domestically as well as the driving need for the EU to replenish gas reserves. If higher electricity prices reflect this thesis, CleanSpark may be faced with tighter gross margins in the coming months. Looking at the gas strip price for the remainder of 2025, we may experience higher gas prices relative to 2024. CleanSpark Financial Position Corporate Reports CleanSpark reported an increase of 69% year-over-year in the average revenue per bitcoin in q2'25. Despite the improved pricing, gross margins faced significant pressure in the quarter due to the higher cost of production, resulting in a -16% margin deterioration when compared to the previous year's quarter. Accordingly, CleanSpark's cost-per-coin in q2'25 was $42,600, a 26% increase when compared to q1'25. Cost of production was primarily impacted by the increased difficulty to mine in addition to higher power costs. CleanSpark's quarterly GAAP profitability will be impacted by the trading value at the end of the reporting period, potentially creating a murkier picture of CleanSpark's overall financial health. This resulted in a $128mm loss on the fair value of bitcoin, as reported in CleanSpark's statement of operations. Corporate Reports Subsequent to the close of q2'25, CleanSpark has grown its bitcoin treasury to 12,502BTC in May 2025. This amounts to a 4% increase from the close of q2'25 of roughly 12,000BTC in the company's treasury. The spot price of bitcoin has since appreciated by over 24%, potentially positioning CleanSpark for an improved outlook for eq3'25. Despite the interim price appreciation, a lot can change as CleanSpark nears the close of the quarter, which will ultimately determine how bitcoin is valued on the organization's balance sheet. TradingView In the q2'25 earnings call, management made a few interesting comments relating to shareholder returns. The first is the intent to raise capital through the sale of bitcoin rather than equity raises. This can be beneficial to CLSK shareholders as shares can expect to retain a relative shareholder value to bitcoin without the expectation of excessive dilution. The other comment was relating to bitcoin mining and the next bitcoin halving event in 3 years, suggesting that ""there is no better time to acquire bitcoin than now."" Under this notion, share buybacks may be out of reach as bitcoin halving will occur every 4 years, making this a never-ending cycle until all bitcoin has been mined. Risks Related to CleanSpark Bull Case CleanSpark is steadily increasing its hash rate, nearing its target of 50EH/s. With management's new directive of selling bitcoin to fund operations, shareholder dilution may be minimal going forward, creating a certain appeal to CLSK shares. Bear Case Operating as a pure play bitcoin miner may create certain challenges for CleanSpark as the cost to operate may not be expected to become cheaper. As global data center capacity is expected to grow by a substantial rate over the next 5 years, the price of electricity may experience upward pricing pressure, resulting in tighter margins for CleanSpark. Valuation and Shareholder Value Corporate Reports CLSK shares currently trade at 2x price/BV BTC held in treasury as of May 2025. Ultimately, the value of CLSK shares will be determined by the relative trading value of bitcoin. With the assumption of a growing bitcoin treasury and bitcoin price appreciation, an investor could expect CLSK shares to reflect this trend, assuming the 2x premium holds. Valuing CleanSpark as an organization, extracting value may be challenging for shareholders given the potentially higher cost to operate despite the improving mining yields. Given that CLSK shares are relatively correlated to the direction of bitcoin, an investor must weigh the added operational risk when holding CLSK shares and whether it's worth the premium over CleanSpark's bitcoin holdings. I am rating CLSK Shares with a HOLD rating with no price target.

The crypto major’s rally sparked a fiery exchange on X , with gold advocate Peter Schiff at the center of the storm. Known for his relentless skepticism, Schiff’s reaction to Bitcoin’s surge was unexpectedly candid, which was enough to spark debates about the future of digital and traditional assets. Will Bitcoin Overtake Gold’s Market Cap? Responding to a X user , Peter Schiff says, ‘highly unlikely’ that Bitcoin will take over gold in terms of market cap anytime soon. He cites that with the steadily rising market cap of gold, Bitcoin is nowhere near the competition. At present , Gold, at the top, has a market cap of $22.526 T. Bitcoin sits at the 6th spot with a $2.176 T market cap. In simple words, Gold is 10x times bigger than Bitcoin in terms of market cap. Later, He quipped, “Never say never,” in response to a question on Bitcoin’s volatility , implying that the cryptocurrency market is erratic. Bitcoin may never go below $100,000 again, according to several analysts, highlighting how strong this run has been. Bitcoin’s Technical Power Play Bitcoin’s recovery from a May peak of $112,000 found firm support at the 26-day EMA around $105,000. Buyers pushed the price past the 50-day EMA near $102,000, breaching the critical $110,000 mark. With the RSI climbing above 60 and trading volume rising, the rally reflects genuine demand, not just short-covering. The next resistance zone, between $112,000 and $113,000, looms large, where liquid order clusters peaked in May. The Road to New Highs? The technical viewpoint remains bullish, with Bitcoin holding above the 26-EMA and clearing the 50 and 100-EMAs (around $97,500). If momentum lasts, new all-time highs could be within reach.

The recent upswing validates the rising dominance of the bulls as the memecoin is subjected to a strong breakout. The volatility has now increased, reacting to the broader market sentiment and social media activity. Now that the technicals have also flashed a bullish signal, the DOGE price is set to launch a strong bullish rise soon. As of now, the DOGE price has recorded a modest rise of 5% in the past 24 hours, trading at $0.1949. Regardless of the short-term volatility, analysts continue to remain bullish on Dogecoin as the demand for the token is expected to rise notably. Based on a consumer report by Security.org, Americans are planning to invest in Dogecoin after Bitcoin and Ethereum. These are the top 3 tokens they would invest in in 2025, followed by SOL, XRP, & USDC as per data published by Coin Bureau . On the other hand, the liquidation heatmaps show the DOGE price is flashing potential squeeze levels, which could pave the way for sharp moves ahead. Will DOGE price Reach $1 in the Upcoming Bull Cycle? The Doge price has been experiencing both bullish and bearish pressures over the past 2 quarters, which has kept the token consolidated within a decisive symmetrical triangle. However, after experiencing excessive pressure, the token seems to be close to the edge of a breakout. While the technicals point to a strong breakout to the higher levels, the bearish interference could cause a strong rejection below $0.17. As seen in the above chart, the Bollinger bands remain expanded while the price has rebounded from the lower band and is about to test the average band. Once the price rises above this range, the token is believed to keep rising to reach the resistance of the pattern and further trigger a breakout to the upper bands of Bollinger at $0.25. Besides, the MACD shows a possibility of a bullish crossover as the selling pressure fades away. Therefore, the technicals suggest the Dogecoin (DOGE) price is at the foothill of an explosion, and hence a rise above the consolidation could elevate the levels beyond the local highs at $0.48. However, reaching $1 still remains a tedious task to achieve.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/after-bitcoin-ethereum-dogecoin-doge-is-on-a-bullish-path-will-it-reach-0-3/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|DOGE|ETH|TRADING","Price Analysis|Altcoins|Meme Coins",cryptocompare
2025-06-10T12:30:43,"Paraguay Unveils Bold Plan for Bitcoin Legal Tender","BitcoinWorld Paraguay Unveils Bold Plan for Bitcoin Legal Tender The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with news from Latin America. Following in the footsteps of El Salvador, Paraguay appears poised to take a significant leap towards mainstream Bitcoin integration. Recent announcements from the highest levels of government suggest that Paraguay Bitcoin legal tender status could soon become a reality, marking a pivotal moment for digital assets in the region. What Does Paraguay Making Bitcoin Legal Tender Really Mean? Paraguayan President Santiago Peña recently made waves with statements indicating a serious consideration for introducing Bitcoin legal tender . On the social media platform X, and further elaborated in a presidential speech, President Peña outlined his administration’s intentions. He stated that following extensive consultations with economic experts and a thorough evaluation process, he plans to propose legislation that would officially recognize Bitcoin (BTC) as legal tender within the country. But what exactly does making Bitcoin legal tender entail? In simple terms, it means that Bitcoin would be legally recognized as a valid form of payment for all debts, public and private. Businesses would be legally obligated to accept Bitcoin for goods and services, unless they have a specific exemption or lack the necessary technology to do so. This is a far cry from simply allowing crypto trading or investment; it integrates Bitcoin directly into the nation’s financial plumbing. This move, if enacted, would place Paraguay in an exclusive club, currently only occupied by El Salvador, as nations where Bitcoin holds this unique status. Why is Paraguay Considering Bitcoin Legal Tender? The decision by President Santiago Peña Bitcoin plan likely stems from a combination of economic and strategic considerations. Latin American countries often face challenges such as: High costs and slow speeds of international remittances. Significant portions of the population remaining unbanked or underbanked. Dependence on traditional financial systems that can be subject to external pressures or internal inefficiencies. A desire to attract foreign investment and technological innovation. Adopting Paraguay crypto policies, particularly making Bitcoin legal tender, could potentially address some of these issues. For instance, remittances could become cheaper and faster, directly benefiting families receiving funds from abroad. Financial inclusion could increase as more citizens gain access to digital wallets, even without traditional bank accounts. Furthermore, embracing Bitcoin could position Paraguay as a forward-thinking nation in the digital economy, potentially attracting crypto businesses, miners, and tech talent. Exploring the Potential Benefits of Paraguay Crypto Adoption The potential benefits of Paraguay Bitcoin legal tender are multifaceted, touching upon economic, social, and technological spheres. Economic Advantages: Reduced Remittance Costs: A significant portion of many Latin American economies relies on remittances. Bitcoin can offer a cheaper alternative to traditional money transfer services. Increased Financial Inclusion: Provides access to financial tools for the unbanked population, allowing them to send, receive, and store value digitally. Attracting Foreign Investment: Could draw in investment from companies and individuals within the crypto ecosystem looking for crypto-friendly jurisdictions. Boosting Tourism: Could appeal to tourists interested in using Bitcoin for payments. Potential for Economic Growth: By fostering a new industry and attracting talent, it could stimulate broader economic activity. Social and Technological Advantages: Empowerment of Citizens: Gives individuals more control over their money, free from intermediaries. Technological Advancement: Encourages the adoption of new technologies and digital literacy among the population. Innovation Hub Potential: Could position Paraguay as a hub for blockchain and cryptocurrency development in Latin America Bitcoin space. What Challenges Might Paraguay Face with Bitcoin Legal Tender? While the potential benefits are significant, implementing Bitcoin legal tender is not without its hurdles. El Salvador’s experience provides valuable lessons on the challenges that Paraguay might encounter. Key Challenges: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate dramatically, posing risks for businesses and individuals holding it. Lack of Public Understanding: Many citizens may not understand how to use or secure Bitcoin, requiring extensive education and support. Infrastructure Requirements: Widespread adoption requires reliable internet access and compatible devices across the country. Regulatory and Legal Complexities: Integrating Bitcoin into existing financial regulations, tax laws, and accounting standards is complex. Resistance from Traditional Institutions: Banks and other financial entities may resist the disruption caused by Bitcoin adoption. International Pressure: Organizations like the IMF and World Bank have expressed concerns about countries adopting Bitcoin as legal tender, citing risks to financial stability and consumer protection. Security Risks: Users are responsible for the security of their digital wallets, and loss of keys can mean permanent loss of funds. President Santiago Peña Bitcoin plan suggests ‘rigorous evaluation’ and ‘consultation with economic experts’, indicating an awareness of these complexities. Learning from El Salvador’s rollout, which faced issues with wallet functionality, public adoption speed, and infrastructure, will be crucial for Paraguay. Comparing Paraguay’s Potential Move to El Salvador’s Experience Paraguay is not the first in Latin America Bitcoin sphere to explore this path. El Salvador made history in September 2021 by becoming the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. Their journey offers a case study for Paraguay. Similarities: Both are Latin American nations with significant unbanked populations and reliance on remittances. Both see potential benefits in financial inclusion and attracting investment. The legal tender status means businesses must accept Bitcoin. Differences & Potential Learnings for Paraguay: Paraguay has the advantage of observing El Salvador’s experience. They can potentially: Develop a more robust and user-friendly national digital wallet from the outset. Implement a more comprehensive public education campaign before and during the rollout. Address infrastructure gaps proactively. Develop clearer regulatory frameworks based on El Salvador’s challenges. Perhaps adopt a phased approach to implementation. El Salvador’s path has been mixed, showing both enthusiasm among early adopters and significant challenges in achieving widespread use and overcoming public skepticism. Paraguay’s success will heavily depend on the careful planning and execution of President Peña’s proposed bill. Actionable Insights for Businesses and Individuals If Paraguay Bitcoin legal tender becomes law, what does it mean for you, whether you’re a resident, a business owner, or an international observer interested in Paraguay crypto developments? For Businesses: Prepare for Acceptance: Start researching payment processors and wallet solutions that can handle Bitcoin transactions. Understand Conversion: Decide whether you will hold Bitcoin or convert it instantly to the local currency (Guaraní) to mitigate volatility risk. Update Accounting Systems: Prepare your accounting and tax systems to handle Bitcoin transactions and potential capital gains/losses. Educate Staff: Train employees on how to accept Bitcoin payments and handle customer inquiries. For Individuals: Learn About Wallets: Familiarize yourself with different types of Bitcoin wallets (hot wallets, cold wallets) and how to use them securely. Understand Security: Learn about private keys, seed phrases, and best practices for protecting your Bitcoin. Start Small: If you’re new, start by experimenting with small amounts to get comfortable with transactions. Be Aware of Volatility: Understand that the value of your Bitcoin holdings can change rapidly. Stay Informed: Follow official government announcements and educational resources regarding the rollout. For Investors/Observers: Monitor Legislation: Keep a close watch on the progress of the proposed bill through the Paraguayan legislature. Assess Impact: Analyze how potential adoption affects Bitcoin’s price, adoption rates in Paraguay, and the broader Latin America Bitcoin landscape. Look for Opportunities: Consider potential investment opportunities in Paraguayan companies or infrastructure related to crypto adoption. The Road Ahead for Santiago Peña Bitcoin Plan The announcement by President Santiago Peña is a significant step, but it is just the beginning. The proposed bill must navigate the legislative process, which involves debate, potential amendments, and voting. The timeline for this is currently unclear, but the President’s public commitment signals strong executive intent. The success of making Paraguay Bitcoin legal tender will ultimately depend on careful planning, robust implementation, and genuine public buy-in. Educational initiatives will be paramount to ensure citizens feel confident and secure using Bitcoin. Building reliable technological infrastructure will be essential for seamless transactions. As the situation develops, the world will be watching closely to see if Paraguay can successfully integrate Bitcoin into its economy and potentially set another precedent for nations considering similar paths in Latin America Bitcoin journey and beyond. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards a Digital Future? President Santiago Peña’s stated intention to propose a bill making Paraguay Bitcoin legal tender is a bold move with the potential to significantly impact the country’s economic and technological landscape. While challenges related to volatility, infrastructure, and public education are substantial, the potential benefits of increased financial inclusion, reduced remittance costs, and attracting innovation are compelling. Learning from the experiences of other nations, particularly El Salvador, will be vital for Paraguay’s success. The coming months will be critical as the proposed legislation makes its way through the government. This development underscores the growing interest in integrating cryptocurrencies into national economies, solidifying Latin America’s position as a key region in the global adoption of digital assets.

2025-06-10T12:30:33,"XRP Eyes $2.50 Decision Zone As Macro Wave Structure Takes Shape","XRP changed hands at roughly $2.30 in early European trading on Tuesday, extending a two-day bounce that has pulled the token back toward the upper half of the seven-month range that has confined it between about $2.00 and $2.80 since December. Analyst Quantum Ascend argues that this compression phase is now approaching a technical fulcrum that will determine whether the next move is an impulsive wave-three surge or one final wave-two washout. XRP Tightens Into Decision Zone In a video posted on 9 June, the trader noted that “we’ve been in this range… since early December… between like $2.80 and $2.00 just bouncing the whole time,” before zooming out to show what he calls the only Elliott-wave count that “makes sense”: a completed five-wave advance from last year’s lows followed by a five-wave corrective pull-back. “Right now we’re looking at a one-two-three-four-five on the way down… that’s the macro two… and now we’re waiting on three-four-five,” he said, adding that XRP still represents about 12.5% of his portfolio despite his tactical rotation into “alts with more gas left.” Quantum Ascend’s Fibonacci mapping reveals that the token has already retraced slightly more than 50% of its preceding leg higher—a textbook depth for a second-wave correction—and that the sell-off bottomed in the price region that coincided with the fourth wave of the prior move. “Makes sense, perfect spot for us to bounce,” he told viewers after plotting the swing low against the 0.5 Fib level. Related Reading: XRP Bull Trap Incoming? Analyst Sees $2.40 Fakeout Before Painful Crash Whether that bounce blossoms into a sustained breakout, he stressed, ultimately hinges on the market leader: “I think Bitcoin’s gonna make the decision for us,” he said, pointing out that XRP’s fate remains tightly coupled to any directional conviction in BTC. Bitcoin’s own advance toward key retracement resistance could, in his view, drag major altcoins—including XRP—into their respective inflection zones. The analyst now fixes on the 0.618–0.786 Fib band, which corresponds to $2.42–$2.52, as the “decision zone.” “There’s gonna be an area that we gotta be careful of… statistically it’s the area we’re most probable to roll over… between $2.42 and $2.52,” he warned, outlining the risk that XRP forms an A-B-C zig-zag and revisits lower supports before the larger impulsive leg begins. A rejection there would map onto the classical script of a complex second wave that fakes out early longs one final time before relinquishing control to bulls. Related Reading: XRP Price Remains Bullish Above $2, This Falling Channel Says $3.8 Is Coming Macro currents may soon add fuel. XRP’s next potential volatility catalyst is the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s 17 June deadline on Franklin Templeton’s spot-XRP exchange-traded fund proposal—a ruling some desks see as the token’s analogue to January’s Bitcoin ETF moment. While ETF speculation has helped price reclaim higher ground this month, XRP remains almost a dollar below its January all-time high of $3.40, leaving the $2.42–$2.52 pocket as the most technically significant hurdle in the short term. For now, traders will watch whether the current advance can print a daily close inside—or better, above—that corridor. A clean break would validate Quantum Ascend’s wave-three thesis and open the charts to measured moves targeting the mid-$3s. Failure, by contrast, risks a final capitulation toward the lower-$2 region before the larger bull structure can re-assert itself. Whatever the outcome, the analyst remains sanguine: “Whether it rolls over here one more time and we have to be patient or it just goes—that’s okay, because either way the end result is going to be the same.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.28.

2025-06-10T12:20:09,"Urgent Alert: Paraguay Government Reports Unusual Activity on President’s X Account Regarding Bitcoin","BitcoinWorld Urgent Alert: Paraguay Government Reports Unusual Activity on President’s X Account Regarding Bitcoin A sudden post from the official X account of Paraguay’s President, Santiago Peña, sent ripples through the cryptocurrency community. The message claimed that Bitcoin would be introduced as legal tender in the country. However, the excitement was short-lived as the Paraguayan government quickly issued a statement reporting unusual activity associated with the President’s X account . This swift denial has led many to suspect the original post was false, potentially the result of an X account hack . What Happened with the Paraguay Bitcoin Post? The sequence of events unfolded rapidly. A post appeared on President Santiago Peña’s official X (formerly Twitter) account making a significant assertion: that Bitcoin was set to become legal tender in Paraguay. This kind of announcement carries immense weight, as it would place Paraguay alongside El Salvador as one of the few nations to adopt the cryptocurrency in such a capacity. However, within a short time, the Paraguayan government, through official channels separate from the President’s X account, communicated that they had detected unusual activity on that specific social media profile. They did not explicitly state it was a hack at first but strongly implied that the post regarding Bitcoin was not legitimate and did not originate from the President or his administration’s official policy decisions. This incident highlights the vulnerability of high-profile social media accounts and the potential for misinformation to spread rapidly, especially concerning sensitive topics like national economic policy and cryptocurrencies. Why is Bitcoin Legal Tender News So Significant? The concept of a nation adopting Bitcoin legal tender is a major development in the world of finance and cryptocurrency. When a cryptocurrency is granted legal tender status, it means it must be accepted as a form of payment for goods and services throughout the country, alongside the national fiat currency. This provides significant legitimacy and potential for widespread adoption within that nation. El Salvador’s decision in 2021 to make Bitcoin legal tender was a landmark event, watched closely by governments and financial institutions globally. While it faced significant challenges and mixed results, it opened the door for other nations to consider similar paths. For Paraguay, specifically, there has been previous interest and legislative proposals surrounding cryptocurrency regulation, particularly concerning Bitcoin mining due to the country’s abundant hydroelectric power. However, these discussions have typically revolved around regulating crypto assets and mining operations, not elevating Bitcoin to the status of legal tender. Therefore, an official announcement of legal tender status would represent a dramatic shift in policy, which is why the now-discredited post caused such a stir. The Impact on Crypto News and Markets False or misleading information, especially when it appears to come from official government sources, can have an immediate and sometimes volatile impact on the cryptocurrency markets. Bitcoin’s price is highly sensitive to news regarding adoption, regulation, and macroeconomic factors. When the post about Paraguay Bitcoin legal tender first appeared, it likely generated positive sentiment among some investors, potentially leading to a temporary price uptick or increased trading volume as people reacted to the news. However, the subsequent denial by the government would likely reverse this effect, potentially causing price drops as traders and investors adjust to the confirmed misinformation. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of verifying crypto news from multiple, reliable sources before making investment decisions. The speed at which information (and misinformation) travels on social media platforms like X necessitates caution and due diligence. Understanding the Risk of a President’s X Account Hack The possibility that President Santiago Peña ‘s X account was compromised raises serious security concerns. Leaders of nations often have their social media accounts managed by staff, but the accounts themselves are prime targets for malicious actors, including hackers motivated by political reasons, financial gain (through market manipulation), or simply disruption. An X account hack of a world leader can be used for various harmful purposes: Spreading Disinformation: Posting false news, as seen in this case, to manipulate public opinion or financial markets. Political Manipulation: Posting inflammatory or false statements about other nations or political opponents. Phishing/Malware Distribution: Using the trusted account to spread malicious links. Damaging Reputation: Posting inappropriate content. The fact that the post concerned something as economically sensitive as Bitcoin legal tender underscores the potential financial impact of such a security breach. Governments and high-profile individuals must employ robust security measures, including two-factor authentication, strong password policies, and careful management protocols, to protect these crucial communication channels. Verifying Information: A Key Actionable Insight For anyone following crypto news , especially news that could significantly impact market prices or regulatory landscapes, verification is paramount. Do not rely solely on a single social media post, even if it appears to come from a seemingly official source. Always look for confirmation from: Official government websites or press releases. Reputable national and international news agencies (like Reuters, which reported the government’s statement in this case). Multiple trusted financial news outlets. In the case of the Paraguay Bitcoin post, the quick denial from the government through other channels was the crucial piece of information that debunked the social media claim. Investors and enthusiasts should develop habits of cross-referencing information before making any decisions based on breaking news. What Does This Mean for Paraguay’s Stance on Crypto? While this incident involved a false alarm about Bitcoin legal tender , it doesn’t necessarily mean Paraguay is against cryptocurrencies. As mentioned, there have been legislative efforts to regulate the crypto space, particularly mining. This event is more likely a reflection of social media security risks than a definitive statement on Paraguay’s future crypto policy. President Santiago Peña ‘s administration will likely need to address the security lapse that allowed the false post to occur. The incident might even prompt further discussions within the government about how to officially communicate on digital assets and ensure the security of their online presence. Conclusion: A Cautionary Tale in the Digital Age The brief saga of the false Paraguay Bitcoin legal tender post is a potent reminder of the challenges in the age of instant digital communication. While platforms like X offer direct access to public figures, they also present vulnerabilities that can be exploited to spread misinformation with real-world consequences for markets and public perception. The quick response from the Paraguayan government to clarify the situation was crucial in mitigating potential confusion and market volatility. This event underscores the need for robust social media security for public officials and reinforces the critical importance for the public and market participants to exercise caution and verify sensitive information through official, secure channels before reacting.

2025-06-10T12:12:57,"Bitcoin at a Crossroads as Long-term Holders Continue to Take Profits: Bitfinex","Bitcoin (BTC) is currently at a crossroads, facing the risk of a further correction or a breakout beyond its latest all-time high (ATH) of approximately $111,980. Analysts at the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex say the asset is awaiting its next macroeconomic cue while maintaining a balance between structural support and waning bullish momentum. The coming days will determine if BTC is entering a broader consolidation phase or if the rally will resume. This largely depends on how bitcoin’s price interacts with certain thresholds marked by on-chain pricing models. Bitcoin at a Crossroads Last week, BTC experienced an intense correction fueled by a public dispute between U.S. President Donald Trump and billionaire businessman Elon Musk. Their feud triggered high volatility that exacerbated market uncertainty. On June 5, BTC fell to a local low of $100,420, triggering $900 million in long liquidations across the crypto market. This marked the largest single-day liquidation since April. In eight days, total long liquidations surged to more than $1.9 billion, creating an aggressive shakeout that helped clear excessive leverage from the system. The wave of aggressive deleveraging reset positioning and potentially paved the way for more stable price action in the coming weeks. However, with long-term BTC holders still distributing their assets and realizing profits , analysts believe the risk of short-term correction will continue to grow. This risk is intensified by the absence of a strong catalyst to push BTC above its current ATH. Key BTC Support Zones Since bullish momentum is still stalling, Bitfinex has used on-chain pricing models to identify potential support areas in the event of further correction. The $114,800 (upper bound), $97,100 (mean), and $83,200 (lower bound) levels show the range of short-term sentiment. Analysts believe BTC will consolidate if its price remains sustained within this range, while a breakout will determine the asset’s direction. If BTC rallies above $114,800, then there would likely be a renewed momentum-driven leg higher, which will be supported by spot demand. A decline below $97,100, particularly below $95,600, would signal cooling sentiment and a possible fall to $83,000. Meanwhile, on-chain data has highlighted the $103,700, $97,000, and $83,000 levels as key support zones in the coming days. “How the price interacts with these thresholds in coming days will offer a high-signal view on whether the rally resumes—or if weʼre entering a broader consolidation phase,” Bitfinex stated.

The MicroStrategy executive chairman weighed in after CNBC’s Jim Cramer criticized Apple’s aggressive repurchase program, saying it “isn’t working” as intended. Saylor’s response was concise and direct: “Buy Bitcoin instead.” The comment comes at a moment when Bitcoin is outperforming legacy assets, and major corporations are quietly adjusting their own treasury strategies. Apple should buy Bitcoin. — Michael Saylor (@saylor) June 10, 2025 A Widening Performance Gap So far in 2025, Apple shares are down 17%. In the same timeframe, Bitcoin is up 17%. Over a five-year horizon, the divergence is even more stark: Bitcoin has risen over 1,000%, while Apple has gained 137%. For a company known for disciplined capital management, the numbers raise questions. Apple’s buybacks have long been seen as a tool to boost earnings per share and signal strength to investors. But with diminishing returns and a declining stock price, critics argue the strategy is delivering limited shareholder value. Saylor’s proposition reframes the conversation: if Apple seeks long-term value appreciation, Bitcoin may offer stronger risk-adjusted upside than continued buybacks. Corporate Bitcoin Allocations Are Accelerating The timing of Saylor’s suggestion is significant. Recent weeks have seen a notable uptick in Bitcoin adoption at the corporate level. GameStop disclosed the purchase of 4,710 BTC, worth approximately $513 million, following a successful capital raise. Japan’s Metaplanet announced plans to acquire more Bitcoin using 5.4 billion yen in newly raised capital, which pushed its stock up 12% and positioned it as the eighth-largest public holder of BTC. In France, The Blockchain Group revealed it had acquired $68 million worth of Bitcoin, with additional plans to raise $345 million for future purchases. On the institutional front, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $386 million in net inflows on June 9, rebounding after recent outflows. Together, these moves signal growing alignment across geographies and industries: Bitcoin is increasingly being treated not just as an asset, but as a strategic reserve. So, Will Apple Dive Into the Crypto World? For Apple, the calculus is complex. Unlike MicroStrategy, it has not positioned itself as a Bitcoin-forward entity. The company is risk-averse by design and conservative in its financial operations. Still, Saylor’s suggestion points to a broader shift. As more corporates integrate Bitcoin into their balance sheets, pressure mounts on market leaders to explain why they’re holding back.

2025-06-10T12:12:09,"Is Bitcoin's New ATH Near? Bitfinex Analysts Respond, Reveal Three Critical Levels to Watch!","Leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) fell to the $100,000 level just a week ago amid tensions between US President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. However, BTC experienced a rapid recovery and rose above $110,000 after the second round of talks between the US and China. Bitcoin is also close to its previous ATH of around $111,900, and Bitfinex analysts said that the chances of Bitcoin reaching the new ATH are low. Bitfinex analysts said in a recent report that there is little fundamental support for a new ATH. Analysts stated that a strong technical bullish catalyst is needed for the new ATH and said: “Although Bitcoin is rising, the risk of a short-term correction continues to increase. Especially in the absence of a strong catalyst that would propel Bitcoin above its current all-time high. Without a strong macro or structural bullish catalyst, Bitcoin is vulnerable to short-term corrections, especially as long-term holders look to strengthen.” Bitfinex analysts, who think that there is a short-term correction risk for Bitcoin, also drew attention to the critical levels where the BTC price can find support. At this point, analysts determined the main support levels that BTC should follow as follows: “$103,700 (Spent Supply Allocation – SSD 0.95 quantile first support zone) $97,100 (Short-Term Traders' (STH) Cost Floor) $95,600 (Spent Supply Allocation – SSD 0.85 quantile first support zone)” Bitfinex concluded by stating that Bitcoin is currently at a crossroads, balancing between structural support and waning bullish momentum, and awaiting macro signals for the next strong rally. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-10T12:08:02,"Tether Moves to Open Source Bitcoin Mining While USDT Gains Ground in Bolivia","Tether is deepening its commitment to the Bitcoin ecosystem through a dual strategy that bridges infrastructure development and emerging market adoption. The company announced plans to release its modular Bitcoin mining operating system, MOS, as open-source software by the fourth quarter of 2025. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino says the software is designed to help new entrants bypass costly vendor solutions by offering a scalable and peer-to-peer architecture that supports existing mining infrastructure. In a parallel development, Tether’s USDT stablecoin has appeared as a pricing benchmark in a Bolivian airport store, signaling increased informal use of digital dollars amid the country’s ongoing economic downturn. Tether’s Bold Bitcoin Play: Mining Software Goes Open Source to Spark Decentralization Boom Tether, the powerhouse behind the world’s most widely used stablecoin USDT, is preparing to take a major step into Bitcoin infrastructure with an ambitious open-source initiative. In a move that could democratize Bitcoin mining and challenge the dominance of incumbent players, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino announced on Monday that the company will open-source its proprietary Bitcoin Mining Operating System (MOS) by the fourth quarter of 2025. The announcement was made via Ardoino’s official X account, where he emphasized that the initiative would pave the way for a ”horde” of new mining companies to join the Bitcoin ecosystem without being shackled by costly and proprietary third-party software systems. The MOS platform is designed as a scalable, modular system that uses a peer-to-peer Internet of Things (IoT) architecture. Tether says it will be compatible with current mining infrastructure, including mining containers and various power delivery modules. This makes the MOS accessible not just to future projects, but to existing operations that want to cut costs and gain flexibility. Strengthening Bitcoin's Decentralization The move is the latest in Tether’s growing list of initiatives aimed at fostering decentralization within the Bitcoin ecosystem. In April 2025, Tether partnered with the Ocean mining pool — a protocol founded by Bitcoin core developer Luke Dashjr — to decentralize block production and ensure smaller miners could remain competitive in the wake of growing industrial consolidation. The partnership saw Tether commit both its current and future hashrate to Ocean, giving weight to its message that decentralization is essential to Bitcoin’s long-term viability. Ardoino’s consistent emphasis on modularity and accessibility signals a strong strategic intent: break down the walls that separate institutional miners from upstarts and hobbyists, and reinforce the core ethos of Bitcoin — trustless, permissionless participation. Tether’s open-source announcement comes at a time of rapid transformation in the Bitcoin mining industry. The recent halving event has significantly reduced block rewards, forcing miners to rethink their strategies in order to remain profitable. Large mining companies still hold key advantages, including access to cheaper energy, bulk hardware purchases, and favorable financing. Yet even these giants are hedging their bets by diversifying operations into new sectors. Hive Digital, once a pure-play crypto mining firm, has seen better margins from artificial intelligence workloads than from mining Bitcoin. According to executive chairman Frank Holmes, institutional interest in Hive’s AI division now dwarfs interest in its crypto operations. Still, not all miners are diversifying away from Bitcoin. Canadian firm Cango has gone in the opposite direction. After selling off its legacy business units, the company doubled down on BTC mining and has already mined over $100 million worth of Bitcoin in just two months. A Gateway for Global Participation Tether’s MOS rollout could be particularly impactful for miners in emerging markets, where access to proprietary mining software is limited and cost-prohibitive. Open-source tools could help bootstrap local mining operations in Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia — regions where the appetite for Bitcoin is strong but infrastructure is lacking. By lowering the technical and financial barriers to entry, Tether’s new software initiative could empower a new generation of miners, further decentralize the Bitcoin network, and ignite innovation across the mining stack — from hardware optimization to energy efficiency. While the project is slated for Q4 2025, Tether has not yet shared the specific licensing model or development roadmap for the MOS release. Questions also remain about governance, community contributions, and long-term support for the project. If successful, this open-source experiment could help balance the scales between large-scale miners and decentralized participants, injecting new vitality into the heart of Bitcoin’s decentralized promise. Tether Stablecoin Spotted in Bolivian Airport Store Amid Economic Crisis Meanwhile, in a vivid sign of the changing global monetary landscape, Tether’s USDT stablecoin appears to be gaining an unlikely foothold in South America — particularly in Bolivia, where the national currency is rapidly losing credibility. Over the weekend, Ardoino shared a series of photos showing items priced directly in USDT at a Bolivian airport store, highlighting the growing unofficial use of crypto as a medium of exchange in a country reeling from economic instability. A New Normal in Airport Retail The photos, posted to Ardoino’s official X account, were taken at Duty Fly, a duty-free shop inside a Bolivian airport. The images show various consumer goods, including sunglasses and candy, with price tags denominated in Tether’s USDT — a US dollar-pegged stablecoin. Most notably, one image displayed a formal notice to customers. The sign clarified that customers could still pay in either Bolivianos (the local fiat currency) or US dollars, but the pricing benchmark was set in Tether. According to the shop, USDT’s value was being used to establish a functional exchange rate between the local currency and the dollar — effectively turning USDT into a proxy for currency conversion amid a rapidly eroding official rate. While neither Tether nor Duty Fly responded to inquiries from media, the post immediately sparked conversation across crypto and economic circles. With one USDT equivalent to one US dollar, many observers saw the moment as both symbolic and practical — a sign that Bolivians are increasingly seeking alternatives to a failing monetary system. This is not the first sign of USDT’s growing presence in Bolivia. Back in October 2024, one of Bolivia’s largest banks, Banco Bisa, began offering custody and transaction services for USDT, allowing its clients to buy, sell, and transfer the stablecoin. The move was widely seen as a significant step in legitimizing crypto’s presence in the country, especially amid the broader Latin American trend of crypto adoption as a hedge against currency instability. More recently, reports have emerged suggesting that Bolivia is considering using cryptocurrencies like USDT to pay for cross-border energy imports — a stark reversal from its historical hardline stance against digital assets. In 2020, the Bolivian government banned all use of cryptocurrencies, but the worsening economic picture appears to have forced a reevaluation of that position. A Nation in Economic Freefall The reasons for crypto’s rise in Bolivia are not hard to understand. Once hailed for its economic stability in the early 2010s, the country is now suffering from one of the most severe macroeconomic crises in Latin America. Bolivia’s usable foreign reserves have plunged from $15 billion in 2014 to just $1.98 billion by December 2024. Alarmingly, less than $50 million of that is in liquid cash, with the rest held in gold — a reflection of how tight the government's access to actual dollars has become. The result has been a thriving black market for US currency, with exchange rates on the street soaring to nearly 10 Bolivianos per dollar, far above the official rate of around 7. USD/BOB exchange rate chart (Source: Google Finance ) At the same time, Bolivia faces massive energy import costs, spending an estimated $56 million each week on diesel and gasoline imports. Despite these outlays, the country still struggles with fuel shortages. Inflation has also skyrocketed, with the Consumer Price Index hitting 14.6% in March 2025. Ardoino’s photo of a pack of Oreos priced at between 15 and 22 USDT is a particularly stark image — not just of crypto adoption, but of the collapse of consumer purchasing power. That’s roughly $15–22 for a basic grocery item, a price point that would be inconceivable in most developed economies, even accounting for duty-free inflation. Global Symbolism, Local Realities While Tether remains a controversial player in global finance, often scrutinized for its reserve practices, its growing real-world utility in countries like Bolivia is becoming harder to ignore. As a dollar-pegged digital currency that can be accessed via mobile apps and peer-to-peer exchanges, USDT offers a practical workaround for citizens in countries with unstable banking systems, hyperinflation, or currency shortages. For now, it remains unclear just how widespread USDT adoption is in Bolivia beyond isolated cases like Duty Fly. But if current trends continue, the stablecoin’s visibility could move from retail novelty to monetary necessity.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9512/tether-moves-to-open-source-bitcoin-mining-while-usdt-gains-ground-in-bolivia,"BTC|EXCHANGE|MINING|TECHNOLOGY|USDT","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-06-10T12:00:00,"BlockDAG Technology vs Bitcoin Solaris: Why Experts Say Bitcoin Solaris Will Outperform All Crypto in 2025-2026","Every crypto cycle crowns new kings, and with 2025 around the corner, the race is heating up. Investors are watching, waiting, and positioning for the next big leap. While many are caught up in the buzz surrounding trending technologies like BlockDAG, another contender is quietly setting the foundation for long-term dominance. That contender is Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S). And those who’ve seen its core architecture are calling it the most underpriced powerhouse in the making. BlockDAG: A Bold Idea, With Some Growing Pains To be fair, BlockDAG has brought genuine excitement to the crypto space. Its parallel block-processing model was designed to address Bitcoin’s speed limitations. And in theory, it offers a path to faster confirmation times without sacrificing decentralization. However, many BlockDAG projects are still early-stage, and few have demonstrated real-world stability or compatibility with mainstream wallets, centralized exchanges, or mining frameworks. While BlockDAG is promising, it remains a bet on future execution, not proven delivery. Bitcoin Solaris: Engineered for Speed, Built for Scale Bitcoin Solaris doesn’t just promise innovation—it’s actively delivering it. Built on a dual-layer design, BTC-S combines the security of Proof-of-Work (PoW) with the performance of Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS). The result? A blockchain capable of 10,000+ transactions per second, 2-second finality, and drastically reduced energy usage—over 99% more efficient than Bitcoin’s mining model. But what truly separates Bitcoin Solaris is its laser focus on real-world usability: Dual Consensus Architecture: The base layer secures the network via PoW while the Solaris Layer handles smart contracts and speed through DPoS. Validator Rotation: The DPoS mechanism uses dynamic validator rotation to ensure decentralization and speed. Energy Efficiency: Designed to support mobile-first mining and browser-based participation without specialized rigs. Audited Smart Contracts: The protocol has been rigorously examined by Cyberscope and Freshcoins for smart contract integrity and protocol security. How Bitcoin Solaris Will Make People Rich At its core, BTC-S is engineered to make wealth-building accessible—whether through the upcoming mobile-based mining via the Solaris Nova app or through staking, trading, and ecosystem rewards. Unlike speculative tokens that rely purely on hype, Bitcoin Solaris combines sound economics, robust architecture, and community-first design to deliver lasting value. And it does so with a hard cap of 21 million coins—mirroring Bitcoin’s scarcity while offering dramatically better performance. Meanwhile, its network design allows people to mine and earn even from everyday devices, without needing $10,000 mining rigs or elite technical setups. Break Free from Crypto Limitations—Join BTC-S and Build Daily The $4M Milestone: One of the Shortest and Hottest Presales in Crypto With less than 8 weeks left in one of the shortest presales ever launched , Bitcoin Solaris has already attracted over 11,000 investors and raised more than $4 million. Current presale phase: Price: $7 Next Phase: $8 Launch Price: $20 Bonus: 9% Investors are rushing in as the window to lock in a 233% potential launch return quickly closes. And the momentum shows no sign of slowing. What the Community and Influencers Are Saying Crypto analysts and influencers are calling it early—Bitcoin Solaris is the one to watch. Here’s what some of them are highlighting: 2Bit Crypto: Highlighted its unmatched technical depth and speed in a detailed breakdown. Ben Crypto: Focused on the real utility of BTC-S and why it’s a strong alternative to speculative meme tokens. Crypto Enthusiasts: Many in online forums are praising its mining accessibility, dual-layer setup, and early-stage valuation. With Telegram and X communities growing rapidly— join Telegram and follow BTC-S on X —it’s clear this is becoming more than a project. It’s a movement. Roadmap Highlights: Built for the Long Game The team isn’t just planning for launch—they’re architecting for impact: Q2 2025: Token generation, team expansion, and global outreach Q1 2026: Testnet release and dual-layer optimization Q3 2026: Mainnet goes live with full governance 2027–2028: Institutional integration, AI-powered upgrades, and global blockchain adoption Every phase is structured for scale, strategy, and sustained momentum. Final Verdict: The Project That Could Redefine the Cycle While BlockDAG pushes the conversation forward, Bitcoin Solaris is already building the future today—backed by speed, accessibility, and battle-tested architecture. From its dual-consensus engine to its mobile-first mining vision, everything about BTC-S screams scalability with substance. Add to that a thriving community, audit-backed smart contracts, and a presale that’s shattering milestones—and you have more than a promising altcoin. You have a movement with momentum.
