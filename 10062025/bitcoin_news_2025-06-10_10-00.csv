2025-06-10T07:33:37,"UK plans to recover cryptocurrencies tied to bankruptcy cases","The Insolvency Service (IS) appointed former police investigator Andrew Small as its first dedicated crypto intelligence specialist to help recover digital assets for the UK economy from bankruptcy and criminal cases. Small will help track crypto assets lost in criminal cases and provide the agency with detailed knowledge of the crypto market. The IS claimed that the number of insolvency cases involving crypto as a recoverable asset rose by 420% in the past five years, with 59 cases in 2024/25 compared to 14 in 2019/20. The estimated value of crypto assets identified in insolvency cases also skyrocketed 364x to more than £520K (~$710K) in 2024/25, from just a little over £1K in 2019/20. A 2024 study by the Financial Conduct Authority claimed that crypto assets had risen in popularity in recent years. It found that seven million adults in the UK, almost 12% of the population, held some form of crypto, up from 3.2 million adults (4.4%) in 2021. Special agent Small said there was a rapid rise in crypto ownership in the UK and a similar rise in crypto assets lost in bankruptcy and criminal cases. His work will focus on helping the Insolvency Service trace, assess, and recover crypto holdings from individuals and companies subject to insolvency proceedings. Small says crypto is very much a recoverable asset The UK Insolvency Service has appointed former police investigator Andrew Small as its first dedicated #crypto intelligence specialist. He will be responsible for tracing and identifying digital assets in bankruptcy and criminal cases. The role, based within the agency’s… — CryptOpus (@ImCryptOpus) June 9, 2025 Crypto specialist Small explained that the Insolvency Service had a duty to trace and recover money and assets from individuals or companies in insolvency cases and work to return as much money owed to creditors as possible. The Official Receiver Service, a key part of the Insolvency Service, identified £523,580 of crypto assets across 59 insolvency cases in 2024/25, compared to just £1,436 of crypto across 14 cases in 2019/20. Andrew’s new crypto asset intelligence role will be based within the Insolvency Service’s Investigation and Enforcement Services team, meaning he will primarily focus on crypto asset ownership in criminal cases. Neil Freebury, head of intelligence at the Insolvency Service, said Andrew brought a wealth of knowledge to this role and his previous experience as an economic crime investigator within the police. Freebury added that Andrew’s appointment would help IS investigators dealing with cases where crypto was a factor. “Crypto is very much a recoverable asset, and my role will help the agency by providing specialist knowledge about the types of crypto assets available and the associated technology used to buy, sell, and store them.” – Andrew Small , Crypto Intelligence Specialist at the Insolvency Services The IS was keen on Bitcoin, Ethereum , DOGE, Litecoin, and Non-fungible tokens (NFTs). However, Freebury pointed out that the number of insolvency cases involving crypto asset ownership rose four-fold in the past five years as crypto grew in popularity. UK to collect specific crypto user and transaction data starting next year The UK government will require crypto companies operating in the country to collect user and transaction information from 1 January 2026. The HM Revenue & Customs announced last week that the UK government’s data collection plan will follow the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) Crypto Asset Reporting Framework (CARF). The HMRC also said crypto firms may start collecting information earlier to be ready when the new rules come into force. For individual users, the required data will include the user’s name, date of birth, home address, country of residence, National Insurance number or Unique Taxpayer Reference (for UK residents), and the tax identification number (TIN) along with the country where it was issued (for non-UK residents). For entity users, companies must collect the legal business name, main business address, registration number (for UK firms), and the TIN and issuing country (for non-UK firms). In some cases, platforms must also gather details of the company’s controlling persons. Firms must also report sender and recipient names, addresses, tax IDs & full trade details (token type, quantity, GBP value, & timestamp). Failure to provide accurate, complete, or verified reports could result in penalties of up to £300 per user. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-06-10T07:33:35,"Fartcoin breaks out as golden cross and shark pattern point to $2 rally ahead","Fartcoin could potentially see significant gains ahead amid hype surrounding an upcoming spot listing on Coinbase. According to data from crypto.news, Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ) shot up 22% to an intraday high of $1.26 on June 10, morning Asian time, pushing its market cap past $1.23 billion, enough to flip Dogwifhat ( WIF ) in rankings. Open interest in Fartcoin’s futures market also reached an all-time high of $713 million today, indicating that traders are heavily speculating on further price movements. The long/short ratio on major exchanges is also above 1, signaling more traders are betting long than short, a bullish sign overall. Much of today’s gains followed after Coinbase confirmed plans to list Fartcoin perpetual futures on both its Advanced and International Exchange platforms, starting June 12 at 9:30 AM UTC. Although it’s just the futures for now, traders believe a spot listing could follow, especially since Coinbase had previously added Fartcoin to its assets roadmap on June 6.

Fartcoin price analysis On the technical side, FARTCOIN has broken out from the upper edge of a broadening wedge pattern on the 4-hour USDT chart, a setup that’s often seen as a bullish reversal signal. FARTCOIN 20-day and 50-day SMA chart — June 10 | Source: crypto.news After the breakout, it seems to have found strong support in the $0.86–$0.93 zone. The 20-day simple moving average has crossed above the 50-day, forming what analysts call a golden cross, which usually suggests a continuation of upward momentum. Meanwhile, both the RSI and Stochastic Oscillator are pointing up, hinting that buying pressure is building. FARTCOIN MACD and RSI chart — June 10 | Source: crypto.news Technical analyst Waleed Ahmed also pointed out that FARTCOIN has broken out of a bullish Shark Harmonic pattern, which often signals a strong move to the upside. Given this setup, the next key target appears to be around $1.38, which lines up with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level. If FARTCOIN breaks above that, bulls may aim for the $2 mark, roughly a 60% gain from current levels. That said, there’s still some risk on the way. According to Nansen data, while the top 100 holders have been adding to their FARTCOIN bags, many smart money wallets and whales have been selling over the last 30 days. Exchange balances are also up 18%, raising concerns about a possible sell-off in the near term. Source: Nansen If FARTCOIN fails to stay above the important $1 psychological support, sellers could try to drag it down to $0.50, which would mean a 60% drop from where it’s currently trading.

2025-06-10T07:30:29,"$340M Bitcoin Bet: The Blockchain Group Pushes Institutional Crypto Wave In Europe","A Bitcoin-focused company based in Paris wants to raise $340 million through a unique kind of share sale that happens day by day. Blockchain Group, known for stacking Bitcoin on its balance sheet, announced plans to partner with asset manager TOBAM to make it happen. The money, if raised, will go straight into buying more Bitcoin . Right now, the company holds 1,471 BTC, which is about $158 million in value. That total includes 624 BTC recently purchased, along with 847 BTC already in its treasury. Shares Sold In Small Daily Batches Instead of selling all the shares at once, Blockchain Group is going with a method called “At The Market” or ATM, commonly used in the US. In this setup, TOBAM can buy ordinary shares from Blockchain Group one day at a time. The share price will depend on the previous day’s close or the average trading price for that day—whichever is higher. The Blockchain Group Launches a €300 Million “ATM-type” Capital Increases Program with TOBAM Full Press Release (EN): https://t.co/DbXXbb6OT8 Full Press Release (FR): https://t.co/XbaTfaOqfn BTC Strategy (EN): https://t.co/EiVKw8s4zB pic.twitter.com/dZQCIckgK8 — The Blockchain Group (@_ALTBG) June 9, 2025 There’s a cap, too. No more than 21% of that day’s trading volume can be sold to TOBAM . This helps avoid flooding the market and keeps pricing more stable. The goal is to raise $340 million without shaking investor confidence or creating sudden dips in share value. Board Has Room To Expand The Raise Based on shareholder decisions, Blockchain Group has the green light to issue up to €500 million ($570 million) in nominal value. But that upper limit will only be tapped if the board gives the go-ahead. For now, the $340 million target stands. If Bitcoin stays around its current price— $107,700 —the company could buy about 3,170 BTC with the full raise. That would more than triple its current holdings. It’s a big move for a company that only started this strategy back in November 2024. Bitcoin’s Price And Momentum Matter Bitcoin has climbed roughly 2.2% in the past day and 3.5% over the past week. After hitting an all-time high of $112,000 in May, the price cooled off slightly but hasn’t dropped far. BTC recently bounced from $104,100, which some market watchers saw as a sign of strength. Others in the industry are also stepping up their Bitcoin bets. Strategy , led by US President Donald Trump supporter Michael Saylor, is looking to raise nearly $1 billion—way up from an earlier plan of $250 million. The company already holds 2.75% of all Bitcoin in circulation, worth more than $61 billion.

2025-06-10T07:19:00,"Crypto’s Next Big Success Might Just Be Neo Pepe ($NEOP)","This Year’s Best Token Presale Hands-Down Crypto investors and analysts have been focusing their attention on the new project Neo Pepe ($NEOP), identifying it as one of the best-performing tokens among the crypto projects launched in 2025. This crypto project is not just built on hype or inspired by the meme industry, Neo Pepe was built to be decentralized and a token going against the traditional financial systems and their market controls. As financial markets become more regulated, Neo Pepe offers a better option that is designed for transparency, community governance, and decentralization. As the market continues to anticipate new projects, Neo Pepe is positioned as another entry into the market but with more transformative potential that investors can relate to due to its focus on freedom and financial independence. Experts Can’t Be -More- Excited For This Presale Crypto experts are anticipating the strong narrative backing Neo Pepe’s economic mechanism. Investors see the project as an opportunity, with its token possessing the ability to resist centralized financial controls with profit-oriented features. Its scheduled token unlock ensures that the market circulation is balanced, reducing the risks associated with the launch of new tokens. In addition, its auto-liquidity mechanism assures investors that the value of the token can be sustained, making it the best choice of presale in 2025 for investors. Another attractive feature is the ability of the project to carry its community along in decisions through voting and governance. This allows quick adaptation that is in line with the project’s laid down guidelines in terms of its investors and community choices, a big difference from traditional digital assets. Encouraging Tokenomics at Foundation Neo Pepe’s tokenomics sets it apart in the crypto industry. The tokenomics was set up to accommodate its presale, which will take place in 16 phases, moving the price of the token from $0.05 to $0.16. The project is also aiming for fundraising to hit its target of $50 million. This approach was designed to ensure that the growth of the token is structured, helping it sustain its growth. Allocation Percentage (%) Purpose Presale 45% Community-driven token launch Marketing 25% Promotion, Partnerships, Outreach Development 10% Project Growth, Upgrades, Security Liquidity 10% Exchange Liquidity & Initiatives Ecosystem 5% Community Incentives & Initiatives Giveaways 5% Rewards, Events, Engagement After its launch, $NEOP will unlock hourly, ensuring immediate circulation and avoiding price volatility, a feature that is expected to attract investors. In addition, every transaction is expected to add 2.5% to the liquidity, ensuring that a portion of its LP tokens are burnt to stabilize the price of the token and boost investor assurance. In addition, the token distribution shows that the project is following its purpose, allocating 45% of its supply to the presale, 25% to marketing, 10% to its platform development, another 10% to liquidity, and 5% each to ecosystem development and giveaways. This allocation move will ensure growth and support for its community and the development of its platform. Competitor Coins Run for Cover Allows token holders to make decisions through its governance framework, especially on listings and developments. Sets itself apart from tokens like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) by putting its community first and pushing decentralized governance. Stands out among presales like Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) and Solaxy (SOLX), which lacks tools to carry its community along. Positioned as an asset with high potential due to its development model and direction. Avoids centralization risks faced by platforms like Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) by allowing community contribution. Seamless Token Acquisition Steps Entering the project at this early stage requires a straightforward process: You need to set up a wallet compatible with ERC-20 tokens like MetaMask. You will need to deposit funds in USDT, USDC, or ETH. Connect your wallet using the Neo Pepe presale platform. Swap your choice of crypto for $NEOP Check your transaction details and confirm the transaction details. Safely store your tokens inside your wallet. Potential No Other Coin Can Replicate Neo Pepe is not just looking to be a participant in the crypto space, it wants to lead it. Using its tokenomics and community governance, Neo Pepe ensures its members are updated with the happenings, making it a market leader in the crypto market. Compared to traditional cryptocurrencies, the project’s presale structure and liquidity features position it at the front of the growing crypto market. Neo Pepe’s approach to unlocking its token and liquidity maintenance is different from the volatility experienced by some presales, providing investors with a stable investment, making it one of the best presales in the current market. Investors looking for the next big opportunity in the crypto market need to start looking into Neo Pepe ($NEOP), not because of its present appeal but for its promise of combining decentralization and investor empowerment. Crypto investors looking for early crypto projects to invest in are looking at Neo Pepe, with most of them confident in its role as a big player in the market in the coming years. With its presale stages defined and its governance model in place, Neo Pepe presents a blend of opportunity, community, and development for investors looking for them, presenting itself as the next digital asset to look forward to in the market.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/cryptos-next-big-success-might-just-be-neo-pepe-neop/,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Press Release",cryptocompare
2025-06-10T07:17:57,"Paraguay President's X account was hacked and promoted BTC scam","Paraguay’s presidency said Monday that Santiago Peña’s verified X account was broken into and used to spread a fake message about adopting Bitcoin. The warning came after a strange post appeared on his profile, claiming the country had made Bitcoin legal tender and was creating a $5 million Bitcoin reserve fund. The message, written in English, had a Spanish-language image attached that falsely appeared to be an official government notice. The government told the public to ignore anything coming from the account until further notice. Officials said they noticed “irregular activity” that showed signs of “unauthorized entry.” That same morning, the cybersecurity team in Paraguay began working with X’s security department to figure out who got in and how. Officials connect hack to wider crypto scam wave in Latin America According to Reuters , the timing of the breach tracks with a growing wave of crypto scams on social media. These types of frauds usually show up in the form of sponsored posts or fake official messages pushing people to invest. The hacker behind Peña’s account followed that same playbook. The story echoes what happened in Argentina earlier this year, when President Javier Milei promoted a token named Libra on his social media that collapsed almost immediately. That scandal blew up in his face and triggered public backlash, especially after critics accused him of helping to pump a worthless coin. El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele actually did make Bitcoin legal in his country back in 2021 and launched tokenized bonds shortly after. But what happened in Paraguay this week wasn’t real policy—it was a digital trap planted by someone exploiting Peña’s account. This isn’t Paraguay’s first brush with hackers. In May, the communications ministry tracked at least 18 attacks on over a dozen public agencies, including the civil aviation regulator and justice ministry. Those hacks targeted email systems, cloud platforms, and login credentials, and no official link to Peña’s breach has been confirmed. As of now, Peña hasn’t made any public statements, and the fake post has been deleted. No arrests or leads have been announced.

2025-06-10T07:15:37,"Veteran Analyst Brandt Says Ethereum Big Day Is Here","Veteran analyst Peter Brandt suggests that Ethereum may be on the verge of a breakout, saying, ""Every dog has its day."" Ethereum’s price has increased recently, particularly between June 9 and June 10, surging from around $2,400 to over $2,700. This uptick marks a significant rally for the cryptocurrency, continuing its bullish momentum after a brief dip.While Ethereum has experienced considerable volatility in recent months, Peter Brandt, a veteran technical analyst, believes the asset is now setting the stage for a potential breakout.A Potential Breakout in the MakingBrandt highlighted a potential turning point for Ethereum in a post on X. The accompanying chart highlighted how ETH has transitioned from a descending channel to a symmetrical triangle formation. According to Brandt’s analysis, Ethereum has been moving within a descending channel since December 2024, when its price peaked above $4,000. Throughout this period, price movements remained capped within the channel’s boundaries, with resistance at the upper end and support at the lower end. Notably, Ethereum's price tested key levels, including $3,700 in January and $1,390 in April.However, after breaking out of this channel in mid-April, Ethereum's price began to form the symmetrical triangle pattern, which typically signals consolidation before a breakout. In this pattern, Ethereum's price has been capped on both ends. On the downside, support has been tested multiple times, most recently on June 6 at $2,392. Meanwhile, resistance near the $2,700 mark has held firm several times since May.Moving Averages and Market SentimentEthereum’s 18-period moving average is trending upwards, signaling potential short-term bullish momentum. The moving average is currently acting as dynamic support, which may indicate an ongoing upward trend in the market. This aligns with the recent rally and provides further evidence that Ethereum may be gaining strength.On the other hand, the ADX (Average Directional Index) currently sits at 22.72, suggesting that the current trend remains weak. The ADX reading below 25 typically indicates a market consolidating rather than in a strong directional move. If Ethereum's price falls below the $2,150 support level, it could signal a bearish breakdown, potentially leading to further declines toward the long-term support below the $1,390 mark. However, Peter Brandt suggests that Ethereum may be on the verge of a breakout, remarking, ""Every dog has its day — woof woof ETH.” This suggests now could be Ethereum’s time to shine after vastly underperforming Bitcoin.On the upside, resistance is positioned just below the $4,000 mark. Should Ethereum continue its rally, it could surge by approximately 48.7%, moving from its current price of $2,689 to the $4,000 resistance level.Inflows Into Ethereum: A Strong Market SignalMeanwhile, the digital asset market has seen strong inflows, with Ethereum leading the pack. According to CoinShares data , digital asset investment products experienced $224 million in inflows last week, continuing a seven-week streak of positive growth. Notably, Ethereum accounted for the largest share of these inflows, with $296.4 million entering the market. This marks the seventh consecutive week of inflows for Ethereum, pushing the total to $1.5 billion over this period.In contrast, Bitcoin has seen outflows, with $56.5 million leaving the market. This shift in investor sentiment suggests that Ethereum is attracting more attention, further supporting the belief that the cryptocurrency could be positioning itself for a breakout.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/10/veteran-analyst-brandt-says-ethereum-big-day-is-here/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=veteran-analyst-brandt-says-ethereum-big-day-is-here,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Market|Ethereum Price Prediction|Latest Ethereum (ETH) News Today",cryptocompare

In a new report in the San Francisco Chronicle, Tamim Ghulam Haidar, the former Wells Fargo Union City branch operations associate manager, is accused of putting less money into the bank’s ATMs than he reported and pocketing the difference for his own use. Haidar allegedly deposited the ill-gotten gains he is accused of “knowingly and intentionally” embezzling into his own bank accounts or those he controlled and used the funds to cover losses that “he incurred while trading in the foreign currency markets,” according to legal documents filed in the U.S. District Court Northern District of California. Haidar allegedly committed the crimes from February 2021 to October 2022. Prosecutors accuse Haidar of sometimes using other bank employees’ credentials to deposit cash in the ATM to “conceal the fact he was inputting false and inflated dollar amounts.” Haidar is charged with embezzlement by a bank employee and engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity. He faces up to 30 years in federal prison. Prosecutors are also seeking to force Haidar to forfeit the money he allegedly stole.

2025-06-10T06:30:55,"Bitcoin transforms limit size to 4MB","The Bitcoin Core development team announced on Tuesday that the upcoming Core 30 release in October will include a change to the default setting of OP_RETURN. The team said the update will increase the date carrier limit from 80 bytes to nearly 4MB. The team also acknowledged that the decision marks a significant victory for the reformist faction led by Antoine Poinsot in their long-standing debate with conservative figures such as Luke Dashjr. Dashjr’s Bitcoin Knots popularity, which is an alternative implementation of Bitcoin node software, is already surging, as many network operators are concerned about the potential effects of the change. Bitcoin transforms limit size to 4MB Today is really sad day, Bitcoin Core is now fully malicious. There is no longer any filters on Bitcoin Core agains't shitcoins on the chain. If you still run Core I very strongly urge you to switch to @BitcoinKnots or to not update Core. Bitcoin is our only chance to escape… pic.twitter.com/SGgWZPIcgk — Satoshi Vault 21 (@satoshivault21) June 9, 2025 Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, is set to undergo a major transformation to the design of its most mainstream implementation. The Bitcoin Core team has gotten rid of the 80-byte limit size of OP_RETURN, an element of BTC transactions, to nearly 4MB. Starting from the Core 30 release in October, the first blockchain will mine transactions with bigger outputs and allow any number of these outputs. Greg Sanders, core developer of Blockstream Bitcoin-centric studio, announced the update on his GitHub page. The author argued that the OP_RETURN size limit was designed to protect the network, but it is now failing its mission. “The change re-affirms that Bitcoin is governed by transparent, minimal rules rather than editorial preference. By retiring a deterrent that no longer deters, Bitcoin Core keeps the policy surface lean and lets the fee market arbitrage competing demands.” -Greg Sanders, Software Engineer at Blockstream. Sanders also revealed that blocks remain limited to 4 million weighted units, dust outputs are rejected, and signature-operation and ancestor/descendant caps guard mempool growth. He acknowledged that the withdrawal of the 80-byte rule yields at least two tangible benefits, including a cleaner UTXO set and consistent default behavior. According to Samson Mow, the former Blockstream CSO and current CEO of JAN3, many users find the update to be an undesirable change for a number of reasons. He acknowledged in May that users can refuse to upgrade and stay on 29.0 or run another implementation like Bitcoin Knots. OP_RETURN limit size indicates how much data can be embedded into a cryptocurrency transaction. The limit is regular for standard ones, like payment transfers, though the existing limit censors more data-heavy use cases. Bitcoin is set to process more data with the new upgrade, opening new opportunities for BTC DeFi and NFTs. The debate about the OP_RETURN size limit stems from 11 years ago. Sanders noted that the long-standing cap, originally a gentle signal that block space should be used sparingly for non-payment proof of publication data, had outlived its utility. Sanders deems the current 80-byte ceiling counter-productive Sander acknowledged that consensus rules decide whether a transaction can ever be included in a block. According to him, standardness rules implemented in Bitcoin Core’s relay code decide whether it is forwarded across the peer-to-peer network before it reaches a miner. The tech enthusiast said standardness offers denial-of-service defense, where nodes decline transactions that waste CPU, RAM, or bandwidth disproportionate to their fee. Policies also offer incentive alignment, which gives policy nudges towards wallet authors for free-efficient yet UTXO-friendly constructions. Standardness also offers upgrade safety, where unknown opcodes or version bits remain non-standard until activated by a soft fork. According to Sanders, it prevents premature use that could hamper future consensus changes. The software engineer said the standardized OP_RETURN outputs embody that philosophy. He noted that users already embed arbitrary data in spendable outputs, leaving toxic, unspendable entries in the UTXO set. Sanders also acknowledged that OP_RETURN gave users an unspendable output not added to the UTXO set; the 80-byte ceiling accompanied it as a soft deterrent, which was large enough for a hash or short commitment. According to Sanders, the modern transaction landscape has rendered the legacy cap ineffective and, in several ways, damaging. He noted that several private mining accelerators simply do not enforce the limits, and other centralized services use alternative implementations to peer with these miners as well.

2025-06-10T06:30:49,"Ethereum’s Realized Price Hints at a Market Reset, What Traders Should Know","Ethereum has shown signs of regaining momentum after a recent period of decline. The asset is currently trading at approximately $2,540, reflecting a modest 1% daily increase. This upward move follows a notable dip to the $2,400 range last week, marking what appears to be a short-term rebound from recent bearish pressure. While price fluctuations continue, on-chain analysts closely monitor Ethereum’s market structure through various metrics that provide historical context and potential forecasting value. Recent insights from a CryptoQuant analyst have focused on how ETH’s long-term behavior aligns with certain key indicators, which may help define price floors and signal overheated market conditions. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Ethereum Defend Key Moving Averages – Bullish Signal Or Temporary Relief? Assessing Ethereum Price Floors Using On-Chain Data One of CryptoQuant’s analysts, writing under the name CryptoOnchain, shared a breakdown of Ethereum’s potential “price floors” using a composite of on-chain and market metrics. These floors represent statistical thresholds that have historically acted as support zones during market corrections. Among them is the realized price, which measures the average value at which all circulating ETH last moved on-chain. This metric is often used as a sentiment gauge to track when market participants are in profit or loss. Another benchmark, the mean_price_classic, reflects the average daily closing price of ETH since inception and serves as a cumulative market average. It is used in conjunction with the delta_price_classic, a figure derived from the difference between Ethereum’s realized capitalization and its historical average cap, adjusted for supply. According to the analyst, this delta price is frequently cited in Bitcoin analytics to highlight undervalued zones, and its adaptation for Ethereum provides a comparable lens for identifying periods when the market may be at or near a floor. Tracking Market Tops and Potential Resistance Zones In a separate analysis report, CryptoOnchain highlighted tools for identifying potential market tops. The indicators outlined include the realized_price_x2 and realized_price_x3, which are calculated by multiplying Ethereum’s realized price by two and three, respectively. Historically, these levels have coincided with overheated phases of the market, where prices reached temporary peaks before correcting. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Below $2,800 – Bulls Need This Level To Trigger Next Leg Up Another tool, the price_top_stddev, incorporates volatility into the analysis by adding two times the historical standard deviation of ETH’s closing price to the realized price. This combination serves as a marker of statistically elevated prices, often aligning with periods of heightened euphoria and speculative activity. CryptoOnchain suggests that monitoring these zones can assist traders in managing risk during extended rallies, as these resistance levels have previously preceded major cycle reversals.

2025-06-10T06:25:51,"Missed BTC? MUTM could deliver the biggest gains in 2025","Bitcoin (BTC) recently experienced some of the biggest gains in May 2025. However, the crypto market moves fast, and the rally was over before most could react to it. If you missed the Bitcoin (BTC) rally, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) rally offers you the opportunity for massive gains. Momentum for the DeFi project is building up, with analysts forecasting gains of up to 1,675%. Explosive growth with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Back in 2013, Bitcoin (BTC) was worth around $1,000. Today, those who bought their BTC at $1,000 have seen their gains grow over 100x. However, the era of such massive gains for Bitcoin (BTC) is over. Despite this, there is still an opportunity to make such massive gains in the rest of the market when you choose a project like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that is still on the ground floor. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) does not plan to be just another successful DeFi project; it is built to be the most successful project in DeFi. The team behind it has created a framework that will ensure its long-term growth and success. MUTM tokens are currently in the presale phase, where each token is valued at $0.03. If the price rises to $3, that is easily a 100x increase. For instance, if you invested $2,700 in the presale, that would increase to $270,000. In any other industry, that would be nearly impossible. However, the crypto sector has proven numerous times that such gains are possible. The unique design of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed to be an accretive ecosystem, whose value is expected to continue increasing long after the public launch. The project is built around the Mutuum Finance protocol and the native MUTM token. On Mutuum Finance, users can participate as lenders or borrowers. When a lender deposits their assets in an audited smart contract on the protocol, they start to accrue interest. The interest that they earn is based on the pool’s utilization rate. Borrowers, on the other hand, can take loans within the protocol and pay interest on them at a rate determined by the utilization rate. As more borrowers join a pool, the interest rate rises, which encourages borrowers to pay back their loans. It also encourages more lenders to deposit their assets. Over time, this loop leads to the best possible rate, leading to maximum capital utilization rate. MUTM tokens The MUTM tokens are crucial to the long-term success of the protocol, and the team plans to support their long-term growth to boost the profile of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ecosystem. To do this, they will use protocol profits to purchase MUTM tokens on public exchanges, increasing buying pressure on the tokens. These MUTM tokens will then be distributed to stakers on Mutuum Finance (MUTM), encouraging even more stakers to join the protocol. As a result, protocol profits will rise due to increased user participation. Over the long term, this cycle will generate real value for the protocol users and MUTM token holders. Protocol safeguards In Mutuum Finance (MUTM), the goal is to achieve rapid growth, balanced with the need for long-term sustainability. That design philosophy ensures that the protocol does not run out of steam due to the risk of illiquidity and insolvency. One of the most important measures that they have taken is overcollateralization. That simply means that each loan on the protocol is backed by more than the value of its collateral. This design is based on the reality of the crypto market, where the price of an asset can fluctuate wildly in just a few days. When the value of collateral on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) drops below a certain level, a portion of the collateral may be liquidated. A liquidator is incentivized via a liquidation bonus to purchase the debt at a discount. That ensures they make a small profit while helping to stabilize the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has numerous such measures that are designed to respond to real-world market conditions of the crypto industry. Consequently, it maintains a buffer between the assets and liabilities, ensuring the long-term viability of the protocol. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale MUTM tokens are currently available to the masses via the public presale, which is phase 5. Tokens in this phase are going for $0.03, which is a massive 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. However, this has not slowed down the pace of the presale, which has experienced a massive rise in participation rates in the current phase. So far, over 28% of presale tokens set aside for phase 5 have been sold. Over 11,800 buyers have secured their MUTM tokens, buying a total of over $10.3 million worth of tokens. The presale price is set to rise by 16.67% in phase 6 to $0.035. As such, the current phase represents the last opportunity to make a guaranteed ROI of 100% based on the planned listing price of $0.06. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a unique DeFi project that analysts believe could deliver gains of 1,675% or more. This could be your opportunity to make massive gains, especially if you missed the recent Bitcoin (BTC) rally.

This joint statement, which includes important organizations such as DeFi Education Fund, Coin Center, Solana Foundation's policy arm Solana Institute, Digital Chamber, Blockchain Association, Crypto Council for Innovation, Bitcoin Policy Institute and Paradigm, is considered a critical step in the industry. The BRCA aims not to regulate software developers and infrastructure providers that do not store customer assets in the same way traditional financial institutions do, the statement said. The regulation was first introduced by GOP Majority Representative Tom Emmer and later became a bipartisan proposal with the support of Democratic Representative Ritchie Torres.

This is a meaningful step toward protecting peer-to-peer technology developers who do not control customer funds. The updated bill takes a balanced approach, building on FinCEN’s 2019 guidance that developers and infrastructure providers should not be regulated as money transmitters when they do not control customer funds.” *This is not investment advice.

You might also like: BlackRock met with SEC to discuss crypto staking, tokenization, and ETF rules In an interview with Yahoo Finance on June 9, Robert Mitchnick, head of digital assets at BlackRock, attributed IBIT’s success to Bitcoin’s expanding use as an inflation hedge and alternative store of value. He also noted that IBIT has outpaced even the world’s largest gold fund in inflows this year, with $6.96 billion net since January, ranking sixth among all ETFs. The fund’s rapid growth has led some analysts to speculate that BlackRock could eventually overtake Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, who is estimated to hold around 1.1 million BTC. Balchunas previously projected this could happen by the end of next summer. Adding to its momentum, on June 4, Russia’s MOEX exchange launched futures for IBIT, though these remain limited to accredited investors. IBIT’s rise coincides with the growing interest in crypto ETFs and institutional exposure to Bitcoin, solidifying its position as the industry leader in the rapidly changing digital assets landscape.

2025-06-10T06:08:03,"SEC Pushes Forward with Innovation Exemption for Crypto","This shift was made thanks to the broader agency overhaul after Gary Gensler’s departure. Meanwhile, Congress is advancing key crypto legislation—the CLARITY Act and GENIUS Act—while debating protections for blockchain developers. In the UK, the Insolvency Service appointed its first crypto intelligence officer to recover hidden digital assets after the recognition of crypto’s role in bankruptcy and crime. SEC Explores Rule Changes The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is exploring a new “innovation exemption” that could pave the way for a much more flexible regulatory environment for on-chain products and services. SEC Chair Paul Atkins, who previously worked as a crypto lobbyist, revealed the initiative during a Monday roundtable that was hosted by the agency’s Crypto Task Force, titled DeFi and the American Spirit. (Source: SEC ) Atkins said he instructed SEC staff to consider a framework that would offer conditional exemption relief, giving qualifying firms temporary relief from certain regulatory requirements. The aim is to accelerate the development and market entry of blockchain-based technologies while the SEC works on potential amendments to its existing regulations. Atkins positioned this move as a step toward fulfilling President Donald Trump’s vision of establishing the US as the global hub for cryptocurrency innovation. He explained that the proposed exemptions will be available to developers and firms that are willing to comply with specific conditions, thereby encouraging compliant innovation in the country. Atkins also shared that many of the SEC’s current rules were not designed to address decentralized financial systems powered by self-executing code, which suggests that regulatory updates are necessary to accommodate these novel approaches. Additionally, Atkins asked staff to assess whether broader amendments to the SEC’s regulatory structure could better support on-chain financial infrastructure. He acknowledged that the foundational assumptions behind most securities regulations do not easily translate to decentralized systems where software may replace traditional actors. This announcement was made amid a shift in tone at the SEC since former Chair Gary Gensler stepped down in January. Under Gensler’s leadership, the agency was frequently criticized for regulating the crypto industry through enforcement actions rather than through transparent rulemaking. In contrast, the current SEC leadership, including acting Chair Mark Uyeda and Chair Atkins, launched a Crypto Task Force with the stated goal of creating a practical and responsive crypto framework. Atkins told the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services on June 3 that the SEC intends to use the “notice and comment” process to refine its approach. He also revealed that the Crypto Task Force is expected to release its first report in the coming months. Blockchain Bills Gain Momentum in Congress Meanwhile, US lawmakers on the House Financial Services Committee are preparing for a crucial markup hearing on Tuesday to consider the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025, which is also known as the CLARITY Act. The goal of the bill is to define a regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency market, and it could undergo amendments to include new protections for blockchain developers. Committee chair French Hill introduced an amendment focused on the treatment of “non-controlling blockchain developers,” and proposed that such individuals or service providers not be classified as money transmitters, thereby exempting them from related registration requirements. This amendment seems to draw from the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, a separate piece of legislation that was introduced in May by Representative Tom Emmer and a bipartisan group of lawmakers. The proposal to integrate the two bills gained support from several crypto advocacy organizations, including the Blockchain Association, which urged lawmakers to unify the legislative efforts to provide clearer guidance for the crypto industry. The markup hearing on Tuesday will serve as a platform for committee members to discuss and vote on amendments to the CLARITY Act, and could potentially pave the way for the bill to be sent to the full House for consideration. Meanwhile, in the Senate, legislators are expected to vote on the GENIUS Act, which seeks to regulate payment stablecoins. Senate Majority Leader John Thune wants to finalize the stablecoin bill within the week. Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal praised the bipartisan progress on stablecoin regulation and believes in the importance of a market structure bill for long-term industry stability. He thinks that while rules for stablecoins are essential, the broader regulatory clarity offered by the CLARITY Act is equally vital. Despite this progress, the path forward for the CLARITY Act is still uncertain. Representative Maxine Waters, ranking member of the committee, expressed strong opposition by criticizing the bill for failing to address alleged corruption linked to President Donald Trump’s connections to the crypto industry. Waters hosted a Minority Day hearing on Friday, arguing that the legislation would only serve to legitimize misconduct rather than prevent it. Nevertheless, there are signs of bipartisan support. Representative Ritchie Torres, a Democrat and co-sponsor of both the CLARITY Act and the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, appears to want to push the legislation forward. UK Insolvency Service Targets Hidden Crypto In the UK, the Insolvency Service took a major step toward tackling the rising involvement of cryptocurrency in bankruptcy and criminal cases by appointing its first crypto intelligence specialist. Andrew Small, a former police investigator with experience in economic crime, will now lead efforts to trace and recover digital assets that have gone unaccounted for in insolvency proceedings. This move comes in response to a staggering 420% increase in crypto-related insolvency cases in the UK over the past five years. The total estimated value of crypto assets in such cases rose from just over £1,400 to more than £523,000. Small’s role will involve using his expertise to identify and track various types of digital assets, from mainstream cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum to meme coins like Dogecoin and even non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The Insolvency Service is responsible for recovering funds to repay creditors in bankruptcy and liquidation scenarios, and said Small’s appointment will improve outcomes by providing investigators with the technical knowledge that is required to navigate the complex crypto landscape. Neil Freebury, head of intelligence at the Insolvency Service, believes that Small’s addition to the team will enhance collaboration and help in cases involving crypto ownership. As digital asset ownership becomes more prevalent, Small said that crypto is now “very much a recoverable asset” in insolvency cases. Andrew Small A recent study by the Financial Conduct Authority revealed that 12% of UK adults owned crypto in 2024, up from just 4% in 2021. The average value held by these individuals was approximately £1,842. In parallel with the Insolvency Service’s ramped-up efforts, UK authorities are also tightening regulations on the crypto industry. Starting Jan. 1, 2026, crypto companies will be required to collect and report detailed information on every customer trade and transfer. These requirements include full names, addresses, tax identification numbers, the crypto used, and transaction amounts.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9502/sec-pushes-forward-with-innovation-exemption-for-crypto,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-06-10T05:54:02,"Crypto Regulations in Slovenia 2025","The post Crypto Regulations in Slovenia 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Slovenia, a small but highly developed European country with a population of 2.1 million, boasts a rich industrial history that has significantly contributed to its robust economy. As the most economically developed Slavic nation, Slovenia has consistently grown since adopting the Euro in 2007. Its openness to innovation has been a key driver of success in the industrial sector, making it a favored destination for crypto enthusiasts. Many believe Slovenia is poised to become a powerful fintech hub in Europe. But does its current crypto regulatory framework support such aspirations? Let’s explore Slovenia’s crypto regulations and see if they can propel the country to the forefront of the cryptocurrency landscape. My expectation is positive. What’s yours? Before answering, let’s delve deeper. 1. Crypto Regulations in Slovenia: An Overview Slovenia is renowned for its pro-innovation stance, providing a supportive environment for emerging technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Under the Act on Payments Services and Systems, cryptocurrencies are classified as virtual assets rather than financial or monetary instruments. Regulation of the crypto sector in Slovenia is decentralized. Various authorities manage different aspects of the ecosystem. For instance, the Bank of Slovenia and the Securities Market Agency oversee cryptocurrency transactions to ensure compliance with financial laws, including Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Anti-Terrorist Financing regulations. The Slovenian Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Act (ZPPDFT-2) incorporates the EU’s 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5MLD) and aligns with the latest FATF recommendations. All virtual currency service providers must register with the Office of the Republic of Slovenia. 2. Crypto Regulations in Slovenia: What’s New? Several notable developments in Slovenia’s crypto sector occurred this year: July 25, 2024 : Slovenia issued a €30 million sovereign digital on-chain bond, the first of its kind in the EU, with a 3.65% return, maturing on November 25, 2024. July 1, 2024 : NiceHash announced Slovenia’s first Bitcoin -focused conference, NiceHashX, scheduled for November 8–9 in Maribor. Thank you @CoinEdition for sharing and spreading the news! Come and join us at our NiceHashX conference in Maribor Slovenia in November! https://t.co/AM5XNvOVgI — NiceHashX (@NiceHash_X) July 1, 2024 3. Crypto Taxation Framework in Slovenia Explained Slovenia’s crypto taxation framework provides clear guidelines for both individuals and corporations. According to the Financial Administration of Slovenia, the tax treatment depends on the trader’s status and the nature of the transaction. Individuals : Income earned from cryptocurrencies through employment or ongoing business activities is subject to personal income tax. However, capital gains from trading or market fluctuations are exempt from taxation. Corporations : Capital gains from cryptocurrency activities are subject to a corporate income tax of 19%. The Value-Added Tax (VAT) generally applies at a rate of 22%, although cryptocurrency transactions considered means of payment are exempt from VAT. Companies are not allowed to restrict payment methods to cryptocurrencies alone. Tokens issued during ICOs must follow standard accounting rules and the Law on Corporation Tax. 4. Crypto Mining in Slovenia: What You Should Know Crypto mining is unrestricted in Slovenia, but income from mining is considered business income and is therefore taxable. This includes rewards from validating transactions and any additional income from mining operations. Both individuals and legal entities must comply with Slovenian tax regulations. 5. Timeline of the Evolution of Crypto Regulations in Slovenia Here is a timeline highlighting the evolution of crypto regulations in Slovenia: 2023 : The EU adopted the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), establishing a uniform regulatory framework for crypto-assets, their issuers, and service providers across the EU 2017 : The Financial Administration of Slovenia provided more detailed guidelines on cryptocurrency taxation, based on factors such as the trader’s status and the type of transaction. 2013 : The Slovenian Financial Administration issued guidelines stating that income from cryptocurrency transactions should be taxed. Endnote Slovenia’s approach to the crypto sector is commendable, reflecting its optimistic view of the future of cryptocurrencies. The country’s balanced regulatory framework supports crypto innovation while protecting user rights and preventing illegal activities. Recent developments show Slovenia’s commitment to continually improving its regulatory environment. Slovenia’s crypto regulation framework sets a positive example for other nations navigating the evolving crypto landscape. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-10T05:52:22,"SEC chair Paul Atkins proposes “innovation exemption” to spur onchain development","Under the leadership of Paul Atkins, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is looking to fast-track crypto innovation through exemptions and tailored rulemaking. During the fifth meeting of the SEC’s Crypto Task Force roundtable titled DeFi and the American Spirit, Atkins outlined plans for a new “innovation exemption” that would provide conditional relief from certain regulatory requirements. While broader regulatory changes remain under development, the exemptions would provide a temporary structure to support the safe deployment of onchain services. Atkins said the exemptions would be designed to support firms that are willing to meet specified conditions while developing blockchain-based systems. These measures, he noted, would allow for responsible innovation within the boundaries of investor protection and market integrity. He also revealed that SEC staff have been directed to evaluate whether additional guidance or rule changes may be needed to help registrants interact with self-executing software systems in compliance with securities laws. “These on-chain self-executing software systems have proven to be resilient in the face of crises,” he said, contrasting them with centralized platforms that have failed under recent stress. “Many on-chain systems continued to operate as designed pursuant to open-source code.” You might also like: Crypto languished in ‘SEC limbo’ for years: Paul Atkins reaffirms crypto commitments Atkins emphasised that most securities regulations were built around traditional intermediaries such as broker-dealers and exchanges. “The drafters of these rules and regulations likely did not contemplate that self-executing software code might displace such issuers and intermediaries,” he noted, calling for regulatory flexibility to accommodate these new models. Atkins, appointed earlier this year as part of President Trump’s push to establish the U.S. as a global leader in crypto innovation, has called for a “rational regulatory framework” that balances innovation with investor protection. In contrast to his predecessor’s approach , Atkins is steering the SEC toward inclusive policymaking that recognises the operational differences between traditional financial intermediaries and decentralised systems. Since taking office, he has repeatedly stressed the need for structured, participatory rulemaking that reflects the unique characteristics of blockchain systems and crypto assets. The SEC’s Crypto Task Force, led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, is expected to release its first policy report in the coming months. The report will contribute to a regulatory foundation that Atkins says is urgently needed to support the growth of onchain technologies and provide long-awaited clarity for market participants.

For the first time, Bitcoin can now be used on Cardano for lending, staking, and more, without the need for third-party custodians. The news has sparked market excitement, pushing ADA’s 24-hour trading volume to $500 million. Currently trading at $0.669, Cardano is also gaining momentum after its inclusion in the Nasdaq crypto index, signaling growing institutional interest. Welcome to the first Bitcoin DeFi protocol developed for Cardano https://t.co/CoYvrYnIfI — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) June 9, 2025 Bitcoin Enters Cardano’s DeFi Arena Developed by InputOutput HK, Cardinal allows users to put their Bitcoin to work through lending, borrowing, farming, or staking on the Cardano blockchain. This is made possible using “wrapped UTXO” technology, which can be burned at any time to redeem the original Bitcoin or Ordinals. For the first time, Bitcoin holders have a way to tap into DeFi on Cardano without trusting centralized platforms. Safe, Cross-Chain, and Fully Transparent Instead of custodians, Cardinal uses a secure MuSig2 multi-signature system, making Bitcoin transactions safe, transparent, and decentralized. It also supports cross-chain compatibility with networks like Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche. Cardinal uses BitVMX for off-chain verification, while Cardano smart contracts handle the on-chain logic. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : 4 U.S. Economic Reports This Week That Could Make or Break Bitcoin , Users can now interact with popular DeFi platforms like MinswapDEX, SundaeSwap, and Fluid Tokens to lend, farm, and trade Bitcoin-backed assets. Ordinals, too, can now be used as collateral for loans and traded on other chains without losing their identity. More Features on the Way Cardano’s CTO Romain Pellerin believes this is a huge step forward, but says there’s more to be done. Future upgrades may include wallet support, zero-knowledge proofs, and deeper liquidity. This launch bridges the world’s biggest cryptocurrency with Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem — bringing Robert Kiyosaki’s belief that Bitcoin is “the people’s money” even closer to reality. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-10T05:30:00,"BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Breaks Record as Meme Coin Funds Eye Approval","The crypto ETF market is rapidly evolving, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) setting a new industry record by surpassing $70 billion in assets under management in just 341 days. At the same time, analysts suggest that actively managed ETFs focused on meme coins such as Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe may be on the horizon, reflecting growing interest in retail-driven digital assets. BlackRock’s IBIT Becomes Fastest-Growing ETF in History as Assets Surpass $70 Billion According to Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas, the speed of IBIT’s ascent is unprecedented. “IBIT just blew through $70 billion and is now the fastest ETF to ever hit that mark in only 341 days, which is 5x faster than the old record held by GLD of 1,691 days,” Balchunas wrote in a June 9 post on X. The comparison to GLD—the SPDR Gold Shares ETF—is especially telling. Launched in 2004, GLD was one of the most influential commodity-based ETFs of its time and became a benchmark for alternative assets in traditional financial markets. IBIT has now surpassed that legacy in record time, underscoring the accelerating institutional adoption of Bitcoin as a legitimate and investable asset class. Dominating the Crypto ETF Landscape BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) was part of a wave of spot Bitcoin ETFs approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January 2024. While the initial greenlighting of multiple products ushered in fierce competition, it quickly became clear that BlackRock’s offering was capturing the lion’s share of investor demand. As of this week, IBIT manages over $70 billion in assets, more than double the AUM of its nearest competitor—Fidelity’s spot Bitcoin ETF—which currently sits at around $31 billion. That significant gap highlights BlackRock’s dominance in the space, driven by brand trust, distribution capabilities, and favorable market conditions for Bitcoin. The fund has also shown consistent investor appetite, recently enjoying an unbroken 34-day streak of net inflows. This performance not only signals sustained interest in Bitcoin but also affirms BlackRock’s execution in bringing a product to market that aligns with the long-term interests of both retail and institutional investors. IBIT’s explosive growth has mirrored Bitcoin’s resurgence in 2025, as the world’s leading cryptocurrency has seen a surge in demand following the fourth Bitcoin halving and continued concerns over fiat currency devaluation. The entry of a financial titan like BlackRock into the crypto arena has provided an additional layer of legitimacy to the digital asset sector, encouraging more traditional investors to gain exposure through regulated channels. Many analysts see IBIT’s trajectory as part of a broader structural shift in financial markets, where Bitcoin is increasingly viewed not just as a speculative asset, but as a viable component in diversified investment portfolios. The fund’s success may also accelerate similar offerings for other digital assets, potentially opening the door for Ethereum spot ETFs, or even niche products tied to Solana, Avalanche, or other blockchain ecosystems. Furthermore, the performance of IBIT is likely to be cited in future lobbying efforts aimed at pushing for clearer crypto regulations. Its success serves as empirical evidence that well-structured, transparent digital asset investment vehicles can thrive within the US financial system. Challenges and the Road Ahead Despite its meteoric rise, IBIT—and by extension, Bitcoin ETFs —still face regulatory and market-related headwinds. US regulators remain cautious about potential market manipulation, custody solutions, and systemic risks. Moreover, Bitcoin’s price volatility means that while inflows may be steady now, they could reverse sharply in the event of a significant downturn in crypto prices. Still, the success of IBIT is a powerful signal that investor demand for digital asset exposure is not a passing trend, but a long-term evolution in capital allocation. With BlackRock at the helm and an established distribution network spanning financial advisors, wealth managers, and institutional desks, IBIT appears well-positioned to continue its dominance. As Bitcoin continues to assert its role as a macro asset in the eyes of institutional investors, the precedent set by IBIT may serve as a roadmap for the next generation of digital financial products. Actively Managed Meme Coin ETFs May Be Closer Than You Think, Says Bloomberg Analyst In related news, according to Balchunas, there is a “really good chance” that a meme coin ETF will be launched in the near future—potentially as soon as 2026. In a June 7 post on X, Balchunas laid out his forecast, saying the market should first expect a series of actively managed crypto ETFs, which will likely be followed by one that specifically targets the volatile and fast-moving world of meme coins. Unlike traditional ETFs, which passively track a single asset or a fixed index, an actively managed meme coin ETF would take a dynamic approach. Such a fund would be curated and frequently rebalanced by a portfolio manager who makes real-time decisions about which tokens to buy, hold, or sell based on their performance and potential upside. This approach resonates with the fast-paced nature of the meme coin market, where trends and sentiment shift rapidly, and the next “hot” token can rise—or collapse—overnight. A team behind the Russia-themed Vladcoin meme coin advocated for exactly this structure, noting in a post that an ideal fund would ”hold the promising ones and sell off the weaker ones.” Retail-Driven Market With Growing Capitalization Meme coins have seen an explosion in popularity in 2025, largely fueled by a new wave of retail investors attracted by their viral potential, social media buzz, and extreme short-term gains. Tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), Bonk (BONK), and Trump ( TRUMP ) have become household names in the crypto community—despite their often thin technical use cases. At its peak earlier this year, the total market capitalization of meme coins surged past $60 billion, riding on speculative fervor and political memes. While the market has cooled since the January highs, the sector’s influence remains significant, especially among younger, digitally native traders. Meme coin market cap (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Still, any path toward an active meme coin ETF must first navigate regulatory approval—an area where the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has historically dragged its feet. Balchunas noted that most tokens must first be excluded from the 1933 Securities Act to be eligible for inclusion in an active ETF, making the regulatory structure a key bottleneck. Nevertheless, momentum is building. Several firms—including Grayscale, Bitwise, and 21Shares—have filed for spot Dogecoin ETFs in 2025. Smaller issuers like Osprey Funds and Rex Shares have submitted even bolder filings, aiming to list ETFs tracking TRUMP, BONK, and other politically or culturally charged tokens. “The Dogecoin ETF filing will tell us a lot,” said Balchunas, suggesting that DOGE may become the litmus test for broader meme coin ETF acceptance. While he previously estimated a 75% chance of SEC approval for a Dogecoin ETF this year, that optimism has waned. On blockchain-based prediction platform Polymarket, odds for such approval have dropped to 44% as of June. Boom, Bust, and the Next Wave The meme coin market has experienced dramatic whiplash in recent months. Following an epic bull run that peaked in January, many top tokens have seen their prices collapse by more than 70%. Dogecoin is down approximately 75% from its highs, while Shiba Inu has lost 85%. TRUMP, once boosted by claims of future acquisition by the Trump family-linked World Liberty Financial, is now down 86% from its all-time high. The sector’s volatility presents both risk and opportunity, precisely the kind of environment where an active fund could outperform. Rather than passively holding declining assets, an actively managed ETF could theoretically pivot quickly between outperformers and underperformers, preserving capital during downturns and riding momentum during rallies. More than 70 crypto ETF applications are still awaiting a decision from the SEC this year, according to Bloomberg data. While most of the attention has been on Bitcoin and Ethereum-based products, the potential emergence of meme coin ETFs adds an unpredictable but fascinating new layer to the evolving crypto investment landscape. For now, the idea of a meme coin ETF still feels slightly surreal—a far cry from the days when Bitcoin itself was dismissed as a “fraud” by mainstream finance. But if history is any guide, today’s internet joke could be tomorrow’s Wall Street product. And if market sentiment, social momentum, and ETF industry trends continue on their current trajectory, a memecoin ETF—especially an actively managed one—may soon become reality.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9503/black-rock-bitcoin-etf-breaks-record-as-meme-coin-funds-eye-approval,"BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|SHIB","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

MicroStrategy( @Strategy ) bought another 1,045 $BTC ($110.2M) at an average price of $105,426 last week. #Strategy currently holds 582,000 $BTC ($62.7B), with an average buying price of $70,086 and an unrealized profit of $21.9B. https://t.co/319LQGdmJk pic.twitter.com/UufDG7BDV1 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 9, 2025 MicroStrategy stays fully committed to Bitcoin and buys more of it. The company’s average purchase price is $70,086 per BTC, giving it an unrealized profit of $21.9 billion on its over 150,000 BTC at present. With consistent, sizable purchases, it’s obvious MicroStrategy is not just in it for the short term but is betting big on Bitcoin’s future. The company’s Bitcoin treasury is almost 12 times larger than that of its nearest rival, Mara Holdings. It is also bigger than the total known amounts of Bitcoin in the United States and China, two countries that appear to control huge sums of Bitcoin by way of law enforcement and asset seizures. In the world of corporate Bitcoin adoption, MicroStrategy is by far the biggest player. $1 Billion Stock Offering Targets Institutional Backers Besides accelerating its purchases of Bitcoin, MicroStrategy has also been very busy attempting to raise fresh capital. The enterprise recently announced that it is offering up to $1 billion worth of stock. That number is a major jump from the $250 million stock raise it had initially guided us to expect. This time around, the company is raising the funds by issuing 11.76 million shares of a new security—the 10% Series A Perpetual Preferred Stock, which is priced at a very affordable $85 per share. CMC News: MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor posted, ""Send more Orange"" on X, typically signaling incoming $BTC acquisitions. The cryptic message follows the company's recent purchase of 705 $BTC for $75 million between May 26 and June 1. MicroStrategy now holds… pic.twitter.com/X1OjKLqQHa — CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) June 9, 2025 What makes this offering distinct from prior funding rounds is the kind of stock being offered. This preferred stock, unlike the convertible notes and debt instruments the company has previously pushed, pays a non-cumulative 10 percent annual dividend. That move looks designed to attract institutional investors who want stable returns but without the kind of direct exposure to Bitcoin that other instruments the company has issued have. Instead of traditional debt, MicroStrategy now offers preferred shares. This reduces the pressure to make bond repayments and pay interest on those bonds. It also avoids the dilution risk associated with convertible bonds. This is a strategic shift that reflects the company’s growing maturity in how it funds its crypto-centric operations. It also makes the company much more appealing to risk-averse institutional capital. Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin Vision Remains Unshaken Since the first major acquisition of Bitcoin in 2020, Michael Saylor has consistently and vocally pro-Bitcoin. When he posted “Send more Orange” on X, the Bitcoin community took it immediately as another message urging for more Bitcoin purchases. Saylor has only ever used “orange” as a Bitcoin rallying cry a single time. And yet, for that reason alone, I cannot quite fathom trying to use “orange” as a substitute. It is also noteworthy that Saylor’s recent missive, far from exceeding the excitement provoked by earlier instances of ordering Bitcoin in bulk, is at least arguably less exciting than some of the past proclamations or directives. MicroStrategy, under Saylor’s guidance, has metamorphosed from a conventional software business into a powerful force in the digital asset domain. Its change in direction seems more than just a pivot into a hot new area. It appears to reflect Saylor’s and the company’s deep conviction that Bitcoin isn’t just a hedge against inflation but a far better store of value than whatever you may have in the way of fiat currency or traditional financial assets. Even though Bitcoin is a highly unstable asset class, MicroStrategy’s excellent position—complete with sizable unrealized gains and a well-laid capital plan—gives the company a strong financial cushion. Saylor treats Bitcoin as digital real estate, not as a kind of digital monkey business. He believes that more and more institutional investors are taking this same long view. Conclusion MicroStrategy’s recent activities, from purchasing massive amounts of Bitcoin to bringing forth a fresh $1 billion preferred stock offering, only serve to emphasize the company’s nearly fanatical devotion to Bitcoin and, more broadly, the whole digital asset space. And why not? With 582,000 BTC now stacked in its treasury and a looking-ahead-to-the-next-move capital strategy aimed squarely at institutional investors, MicroStrategy under the continued stewardship of its co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor seems to be, if not quite leading the charge, then at least shuffling to the front of the Bitcoin corporate adoption narrative.

2025-06-10T05:00:46,"Bitcoin On-Chain Warning: Short-Term Holder Selling Accelerates Amid Price Correction","As Bitcoin (BTC) came close to slumping below the psychologically important $100,000 mark last week, the short-term holders (STH) cohort started to show signs of weakening conviction in the leading cryptocurrency, raising fears of a deeper price correction. Bitcoin STH Fear Resurfaces According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Darkfost, Bitcoin STH’s net position has turned sharply negative over the past month. This has happened despite BTC holding above the $100,000 level. For the uninitiated, Bitcoin STH are investors who have held their BTC for less than 155 days. They are generally more reactive to price volatility and market sentiment, often selling during corrections or uncertainty. Specifically, a cumulative net position change of -833,000 BTC has been recorded among short-term holders during the ongoing pullback. By comparison, the April crash saw a net position change of around -977,000 BTC. Related Reading: Bitcoin Signals Strength As Long-Term Holder Realized Cap Surges Past $20 Billion – Details Darkfost noted that current STH behavior closely resembles the activity observed during BTC’s brief drop below $80,000 in April 2025, when the digital asset bottomed out at $74,508. The analyst wrote: Since then, STH appear to have become much more sensitive to market movements, and the recent dip around the $100,000 mark was enough to trigger renewed fear among this group of investors. BTC Showing Signs of Reversal Although BTC lost momentum after reaching its latest all-time high (ATH) of $111,814, the leading cryptocurrency regained strength over the weekend – indicating a possible reversal may be underway. Related Reading: Bitcoin Derivatives Reset: Neutral Funding And Whale Withdrawals Hint At Bullish Shift For example, seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that BTC has broken through the key resistance level at $106,600. In a recent X post, Martinez predicted that Bitcoin could rally to $108,300 or even $110,000 if current momentum continues. In a separate X post, fellow crypto analyst Rekt Capital shared the following Bitcoin daily chart, noting that the cryptocurrency not only broke out of its two-week downtrend – highlighted in light blue – but may now be turning that former resistance into a new support level. Meanwhile, several technical indicators also point to continued bullish momentum. Notably, Bitcoin’s Hash Ribbons have recently flashed a prime buying signal. Additionally, on-chain data suggests that BTC could experience a sharp upward move in the short term, potentially driven by a negative funding rate on Binance. A prolonged period of negative funding rates often sets the stage for a short squeeze. Despite the bullish outlook, some red flags remain. Recent data shows that long-term holders are gradually exiting the market, while an influx of retail investors could add volatility to the current rally. At press time, BTC trades at $107,627, up 1.9% in the past 24 hours.

2025-06-10T04:59:53,"$AVL Token Soars 21% After Major Burn: Avalon Labs Reshapes Its Ecosystem","In a sensational shift that rocked the crypto markets, Avalon Labs’ home token, $AVL , blasted off and shot up 21% following the declaration of a colossal token melt. The blockchain-borne financial services platform assured us that it had eternally deleted 80 million $AVL tokens from nature’s circulating supply, and the crypto community seems to have taken this as a sign that confidence and interest in the project has renewed. The whole thing looks like savagely good optics for Avalon. Avalon Labs has announced the burn of 80 million AVL tokens, representing approximately 44% of the circulating supply. The burned tokens primarily came from unclaimed allocations in an earlier airdrop campaign. Launched in March 2024, the campaign saw a total of $20 million worth… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 9, 2025 The incineration, which affects a jaw-dropping 44% of the total circulating supply of $AVL, was mainly made up of unclaimed tokens from a past airdrop. At the time of the incineration, these tokens were worth about 16 million dollars and were obliterated, signaling a clear move toward deflationary tokenomics in the Avalon ecosystem. Token Burn Signals a Deflationary Pivot Avalon Labs’ recent token burn is something more than a mere technical update; it’s a bold, strategic move that positions us for a deflationary future. Token burns reduce the total supply of a cryptocurrency, often increasing its scarcity, which, when there is still demand for the asset, increases its price. Avalon Labs has officially burned 80M $AVL , representing 44% of the circulating supply. These unclaimed airdrop tokens, worth approximately $16 million, have now been permanently removed from circulation. Over the past year, a total of $20M worth of $AVL has been claimed by… pic.twitter.com/GXMWKpmbNF — Avalon Labs (@avalonfinance_) June 9, 2025 Avalon Labs has hugely curtailed the supply of the token, with 80 million tokens now permanently excised from circulation. This event marks the start of a deflationary cycle for $AVL—one that is supposed to deliver long-term, unlocked value for holders and even better incentive alignment across the ecosystem. The market seemed to like the move, with the token popping 21% almost immediately after the announcement. The burn also serves to clean up the token’s ledger by eliminating dormant or unclaimed tokens, many of which were leftover from Avalon’s initial airdrop campaign. Avalon Labs: Bridging Bitcoin with Modern Finance Avalon Labs sees itself as something quite different: a next-generation financial services platform, built on the Bitcoin network. Whereas Ethereum and other blockchains often grab the headlines in the growing world of decentralized finance (DeFi), Avalon is carving out a unique position, a “niche” in its own words, in the development of a Bitcoin-based financial services platform. Of late, Avalon Labs has finished a round of strategic funding, and for this, it was YZi Labs who took the lead. Avalon now boasts not only a substantially beefed-up balance sheet but also significant momentum on the operational and developmental fronts, too. It hopes to use its new cash to widen its user inroad and to go to market with several Bitcoin-native financial products. The firm insists that what it’s really after in all these machinations is the construction of a robust ecosystem where those who hold the Avalon token are rewarded for something much better than what 2018 promised: long-term participation instead of short-term flipping. The recent Avalon burn, in effect, updates the tokenomics so the remainders are no longer dead weight. Investor Sentiment Turns Bullish Since the token was burned, the feeling in the $AVL around has changed. The $AVL isn’t burnt, sentiment in the crypto community is definitely good. What is Avalon Labs doing? They are taking bold action with the $AVL. Why is that? Because they are doing what many other projects in the space are not doing. They are combating oversupply and inflationary pressures, and they are doing it in the most straightforward way imaginable. Avalon Labs is at a key moment, and so is the cryptocurrency industry. This industry faces rising scrutiny over the real-world usefulness of its tokens and the viability of its growth models. With the appearance of mechanics that promise a declining supply of its tokens, and the backing of some serious institutional investors like YZi Labs, Avalon seems well set to ride out the market’s ups and downs and establish itself as a credible player. Yet, at the same time, the scrutiny seems likely to increase. The impact of this burn may go beyond merely moving the price. It’s a signal to both existing and would-be investors that Avalon Labs isn’t kidding around. They’ve got a serious, unfussy, value-driven program that lays down a path for long-term growth. Once this week’s action-packed market reshuffle settles, one thing stands out: Avalon Labs’ $AVL token is no longer just an obscure under-the-radar play.

2025-06-10T04:48:57,"Signs of Accumulation Emerge as Bitcoin (BTC) Shipped to $110K","Bitcoin broke above $107,000 on Monday in a notable respite and kept climbing to $110,500 on Tuesday morning, following last week’s turbulence sparked by the Trump-Musk fallout. The latest on-chain data now suggests that the crypto asset may be preparing for its next upward move, as several key indicators reflect growing bullish sentiment. Bitcoin Demand Strengthens According to CryptoQuant’s latest update , one of the primary signals comes from Binance’s Taker Buy/Sell Ratio, a metric that measures the volume of market buy orders relative to market sell orders. The metric has recently surged to 1.1, which means that traders on Binance are showing significantly more buying aggression than selling. Historically, values above 1 tend to reflect a shift toward increased demand and bullish market behavior. Another supportive indicator is the 90-day Buy/Sell Pressure Delta, which is climbing toward previous historical peaks of around 0.02. This delta represents the net accumulation behavior across the market. Although the current level is not yet excessive, it suggests sustained accumulation without signs of overheating. This environment could be conducive to gradual price expansion. Re-Accumulation Phase Bitcoin’s price has broken above the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) 1-day to 1-week band. This band tracks coins moved within the last week, and its breakout indicates that newer coins are now in profit and are being held rather than sold off. Such breakouts have previously preceded transitions from distribution to re-accumulation phases, and often indicated that a newer cohort of investors is entering the market with strong holding conviction. Further validating this narrative is the rise in the Realized Cap held by long-term holders (LTH), which has now surpassed $56 billion. This suggests that coins are increasingly moving into wallets that have historically held assets for over 155 days, which reflects a general lack of intent to sell. These wallets tend to represent “smart money” that accumulates rather than exits during bullish phases. Considering all these factors together, the data reflects a market that is neither in euphoria nor fear, but showing clear signs of strengthening fundamentals and increasing investor confidence, which could point to the possibility of Bitcoin’s next leg higher, despite June jitters .

2025-06-10T04:48:48,"Bitcoin Rebounds to $108K as Short Squeeze and FOMO Drive Monday Surge","The renewed energy in the markets at the week’s start has carried over nicely into the cryptocurrency space, with Bitcoin—BTC —making a dramatic return to the $108,000 level as we now head toward the weekend. Just four days ago, BTC was on the edge of dipping below the less-than-psychological $100,000 threshold. Retail traders in the space had been FOMOing heavily into Bitcoin, which had pushed its price so high that some were starting to call it a bubble. Panic selling in these same retail traders pulled the market downward, but now we are back on the way up. The price of Bitcoin surged from 105,000 dollars to 107,000 in a matter of hours on Monday, before further increasing to touch 108,000 dollars. The move, of course, came as a pleasant surprise to holders, but it was also something of a relief to soured market sentiment, which, only weeks earlier, had taken the nascent industry to new depths of despair. Monday’s surge led some observers to hypothesize about the return of a bull market, even if others pointed wryly to the nature of Bitcoin’s recent trading and the kinds of things that are often said before a major price drop. Monday has kicked off with a bang for crypto traders, as Bitcoin has quickly returned to $108K. After threatening to fall below $100K just 4 days ago, retail traders panic sold. Now, they are showing signs of flooding back in with the 2nd largest spike in FOMO in the past 2… pic.twitter.com/ZlPvHy8CGg — Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 9, 2025 Short Liquidations Spark Rally The most recent surge in the market seems to have been generated by overzealous short sellers being forced to cover their positions. One measurable effect of this was seen between 1 and 5 PM, on a Monday afternoon, when total liquidations of short positions jumped from $105,000 to $359,000. Rising prices were clearly doing their job, but it is also possible that some market orders had hit certain key price levels, generating an uptick in price behavior that even more short sellers wanted to stay away from. All in all, something like $250 million worth of short positions were liquidated during this time. $BTC jumped from $105K to $107K today – likely fuelled by a wave of short liquidations. Over just 4 hours, total short liquidations spiked from $105K to $359K (24H SMA). Last week’s negative funding rates had pointed to rising short appetite, and today, those bets got squeezed. pic.twitter.com/TMkdyXjOUZ — glassnode (@glassnode) June 9, 2025 In the week leading up to today, the funding rates across the main derivatives exchanges swung negative and maintained that position. This was a clear signal that traders were heavily shorting Bitcoin. And when a trading environment is heavily short, it becomes increasingly ripe for a short squeeze, which is when the price unexpectedly moves upward and forces traders who are short (betting that the price will go down) to the buy side in order to cover their now losing position. Although rapid upward price spikes can result from a short squeeze, they are not necessarily long-lasting. Traders now must watch for sustained follow-through volume and for new buying pressure—especially from institutional investors—to step in and support these elevated price levels. Retail Sentiment Turns Euphoric Once Again Retail-driven enthusiasm is surging again, as seen on social media where the FOMO meter is registering its second-largest spike in the past two weeks. This is bringing previously sidelined retail investors back into the market. It is almost hard to believe after the plunge seen just days ago when Bitcoin was at a sub-$100,000 breakdown level, but this enthusiasm is the real deal. In the past, Bitcoin has had a tendency to move in the opposite direction of extreme retail sentiment. When FOMO (fear of missing out) reaches its highest levels, it coincides with local tops for Bitcoin. Likewise, when the crowd is in a state of capitulation (when everyone is throwing in the towel), it has frequently marked a bottom for Bitcoin. This sentiment dynamic is particularly intense in crypto, where price action is often driven by psychological and behavioral patterns. Particularly, social media has turned out to be a counter-indicator of sorts. When it is retail traders who are dominating the platforms, it is also the same time that experienced market participants are reducing their exposure. Given the intensity of today’s surge in retail sentiment, the next 24-48 hours should tell us a lot about the duration and sustainability of this current rally. #Bitcoin spot ETFs saw net outflows of -4.6K $BTC last week – first negative week in 8. Total holdings are now 1.20M #BTC , down ~11.5K #BTC from the late-May peak.

Last week, Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced net outflows of 4,600 BTC; that marks the first negative week for ETFs in eight. Total ETF holdings now stand at approximately 1.20 million BTC. They are down roughly 11,500 BTC from their peak in late May.

Signs of renewed ETF inflows would be clear evidence of continued institutional interest and, we think, could act as a strong confirmation of the more than just technically squeezed recent rally. At present, the market is experiencing a degree of optimism because of Monday’s rebound. But as always in the world of cryptocurrency, volatility is at a peak, sentiment is changeable, and the next big market move could come just as fast as the last one.

2025-06-10T04:46:59,"Ethereum ETFs Draw Nearly $843M in Inflows as Institutional Momentum Builds","Ethereum is once more under the market’s focus and the crypto spotlight. It seems to be back. And it’s not just Bitcoin . Traditional finance investing and capital is flowing into Ethereum as well. The last four weeks alone have seen American spot ETFs for Ethereum receive $842.9 million in new capital. With fidelity from spiritual-quality companies like BlackRock and Fidelity, the Ethereum capital inflow seems not just steady but increasing. From April 9 to now, ETH has gained ~69%, easily pushing through several layers of resistance and renewing investor optimism about a fresh macro rally. $ETH ETF INFLOWS DON'T LIE In just 4 weeks, U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs have seen $842.9M in net inflows, a tidal wave of institutional capital that’s helping push ETH up 69% since April 9th! Big money is here, and they’re not just dipping their toes, they’re diving in.… pic.twitter.com/XNelyZCvuz — ethereum.network (@EthereumNetw) June 9, 2025 Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum is moving toward not just institutional but regulatory demand for what is becoming a more critically accepted layer of digital infrastructure. Near-future economic models for Ethereum are projected to be a lot healthier. Scalable platform means no congestion in the system regardless of volume of transactions, and that no systematic collapse of fees. Above all, Dapp (decentralized App) leads to DTV (decentralized transaction vehicle)/DTP (decentralized trading platform). No collapse model means anything from three-fifths to six-tenths of ETH hitting the market as profits over the next 36 months. And the Dapp takes further advantage of the Ethereum blockchain. Wall Street Goes All-In: Ethereum ETF Inflows Paint a Bullish Picture Over the past month, the spot Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. have seen astonishing inflows that very clearly indicate the growing confidence of structures in the Ethereum network as a solid investment vehicle. These investment structures have now pulled in nearly $843 million. That’s coming from vehicles that only exist because the SEC has finally pulled its head out of the sand and approved them after many, many months of seemingly endless regulatory scrutiny. This seems to be a strategic rather than a speculative investment. Institutional investors aren’t chasing after short-term profits like retail investors; they’re taking positions for the long haul. This isn’t a temporary upsurge in interest; it’s a deliberate move. For a number of institutional investors, Ethereum is a lot more than a cryptocurrency: it’s the infrastructure the decentralized future is being built on, with applications in finance, identity, and gaming, not to mention the real-world assets that humanity plays around with. The recent influx of interest from institutions is also being given a lot of the fresh credit for ETH’s recent price movement. Since early April, Ethereum has soared nearly 70%, a rally that pretty much coincides with the incoming ETF inflow trend. This participation and the capital size really involved suggest that Ethereum is no longer living only in the native crypto neighborhood. It’s now part of the broader financial world. Ethereum L2 transaction fees are rapidly declining. In the last 30 days: •⁠ ⁠Base: 66 $ETH (-34,8%) •⁠ ⁠⁠World Chain: 33 $ETH (-64,5%) •⁠ ⁠Arbitrum: 20 $ETH (-84,5%) •⁠ ⁠OP: 12 $ETH (-68,5%) •⁠ ⁠Polygon: 7,5 $ETH (-78,6%) Fees are trending toward zero.… pic.twitter.com/iddTtMMEo7 — Ted (@TedPillows) June 9, 2025 Ethereum Layer 2s Slash Fees, Reinforcing Long-Term Utility Even though mainstream adoption brings external affirmation, the real reason to be excited about Ethereum is how incredibly well it works as a piece of technology. Take the Layer 2 “rollup” networks that sit on top of Ethereum and promise to scale it. To give an idea of how far we have come, over the course of December and January, the costs to users for operating their rollup networks went down by an average of 300%. That is absolutely insane. And again, it is not something that went down by 50% over a couple of weeks and we all hope it comes back up. This went down by 300% and is something that we expect to happen again, in a well-mapped-out, planned, and in many cases, already implemented way. More on this in a bit. Over the past month, quite a few prominent Layer-2 chains registered some substantial reductions in Ethereum fees. To be precise, the following five, which are some of the biggest L2 chains, reported the following reductions: – Base: Recorded 66 ETH in fees, down 34.8%. – World Layer: Reported 33 ETH in fees, down 64.5%. – Arbitrum: Registered a much more substantial reduction with fees falling to 20 ETH, marking an 84.5% drop since last month. – Optimism: Reported a smaller, but still notable, reduction ending up with 12 ETH in fees, down 68.5%. – Polygon: Registered 7.5 ETH in fees, down 78.6%. This data makes one thing very clear—transaction costs across the ecosystem are falling. And they are falling fast, not by chance but by design. Ethereum’s roadmap gives pride of place to not just scalability but also efficiency, and the reduction in fees we’re seeing now seems to point to the growing effectiveness of that strategy. You could argue that as fees decrease, the yield rises on the usability of the network. And increased usability (which must also not come at the cost of security) is a gateway to Ethereum’s interaction with the masses. Ethereum is becoming cost-effective. It is becoming accessible. It is becoming useful. And like any infrastructure, those three things are absolutely vital if you want people to build on top of/within said infrastructure. Is This the Beginning of Ethereum’s Next Macro Rally? With a combination of price and fundamental momentum, Ethereum seems to be at the early stages of the next major market cycle. The forces of both institutional capital and tech are consolidating and fusing around the asset. Like a train coming into the station, Ethereum is regaining not only its market position but also new legitimacy as an asset class. We see not only tech but also established financial institutions rallying around ETH. What sets this rally apart from the previous ones is its foundation. Instead of being propelled mainly by retail speculation, the present rise of Ethereum is supported by long-term investment, structural enhancements, and a future in which Ethereum is likely to be scalable. The coming together of lower fees, a surge in ETF demand, and infrastructure upgrades points toward an Ethereum ecosystem that seems more mature and resilient. Should Ethereum persist as scalable and cost-efficient infrastructure, attracting more and more institutional investment, this might be more than just a run-up. It might well be a foundational chapter in the ongoing story of Ethereum as a next-generation global economic layer. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.
