2025-06-10T08:48:57,"Bitcoin Hits 2 Week High, Fartcoin Explodes 18% Daily (Market Watch)","Bitcoin’s price ascent continued in the past several hours as the asset soared past $110,500 for the first time in about two weeks. Most altcoins are also well in the green on a daily scale, with ETH surging by 8% and HYPE nearing its all-time high. BTC Shot Up to $110.5K It was just five days ago when the primary cryptocurrency dumped hard following the escalating tension between U.S. President Donald Trump and Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk. At the time, BTC plunged to a multi-week low of $100,400. However, the bulls managed to defend that level and staged a quick recovery. Within a few days, BTC was back to its consolidation range between $104,000 and $106,000. It spent the weekend there as well, but started to climb hard on Monday and especially on Tuesday morning during the Asian trading session. The culmination occurred hours ago when the asset skyrocketed to just over $110,500, marking its highest price tag in June and a two-week peak. Although it has lost some ground since then and now sits just above $109,000, BTC is still 3.5% up on the day. Its market capitalization has risen to $2.170 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts stands tall above 61%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Back in Green HYPE has risen by double digits and has neared its all-time high set less than a month ago. A 12% daily surge has turned it into the best performer from the larger-cap alts. Next in line from this cohort of assets are LINK, SUI, AVAX, SOL, and DOGE. Ethereum has also notched an impressive surge, gaining almost 8% and trading close to $2,800. The biggest gainers from the top 100 alts are Fartcoin (18%), dogwifhat (16%), UNI (15%), AAVE (14.4%), and TAO (13%). The total crypto market cap has added around $60 billion in a day and is up to $3.535 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

2025-06-10T08:44:46,"FinCEN compliance approval：AIXA Miner Free Cloud Mining Helps You Earn Huge Daily Profit","As technology evolves, the global mining industry is shifting to a green model powered by renewable energy. Leaders like AIXA Miner have built zero-carbon cloud mining networks using solar and wind energy, cutting unit energy consumption by 70%+ and using smart microgrids to sell surplus power for extra income. This model solves traditional mining’s high-carbon inefficiencies, creating a dual profit stream from “clean energy cost savings + grid sales dividends” and merging new energy tech with the digital economy. In crypto’s fast-paced landscape, ease of use and stable returns are key. Cloud mining removes hardware and maintenance hurdles for novices—simply purchase a contract to access top green mining, with daily earnings auto-distributed via smart contracts. The platform’s “Newbie Growth System” offers first-monthbonuses, risk hedging, and a real-time carbon footprint tracker, ensuring every investment delivers both financial and environmental value. In-depth analysis of cloud mining: principles, advantages and operation mode Cloud mining: a lightweight mining model for cryptocurrency based on remote computing power sharing Cloud mining is an innovative mechanism for cryptocurrency mining by accessing the shared computing power resources of professional data centers around the world. Users do not need to purchase mining machines (the cost of a single high-end ASIC mining machine exceeds $3000), build a cooling system (initial investment exceeds $800) or undertake power operation and maintenance (average monthly electricity bill is $500+). They only need to subscribe to standardized computing power contracts through the platform to directly call the computing power of cutting-edge equipment such as Antminer T21 and Bitmain S21. This model reduces the unit computing power cost by more than 65% through large-scale operations, and relies on the intelligent scheduling system to optimize mining efficiency in real time. Daily income is automatically distributed to user accounts through blockchain smart contracts. Compared with traditional self-built mines, cloud mining not only saves more than 90% of initial investment and 75% of operation and maintenance time, but also allows ordinary investors to easily participate in the network verification of mainstream currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum with zero technical threshold, and obtain sustainable block rewards, redefining the “passive income” paradigm in the field of digital assets. Five core advantages of cloud mining: opening a new path to easy profit 1. Convenient investment, earn money as soon as you choose No complicated operation is required, just register and choose the computing power contract to participate. The process is extremely simple and easy to understand, and novices can quickly get started, eliminating the tedious preliminary preparations for traditional investment. 2. Zero hardware investment, light equipment No need to purchase hardware equipment such as mining machines, completely get rid of the burden of procurement, maintenance and update. The platform is equipped with professional high-end mining machines, and users only need to rent computing power to enjoy efficient mining, greatly reducing the initial cost. 3. Zero technical threshold, full-process hosting No need to master blockchain or mining expertise, the platform provides full-process technical support and maintenance. From computing power allocation to mining operation, it is handled by a professional team, truly realizing an easy mode that “novices” can participate in. 4. Flexible contracts, adjustable strategies Provide multi-currency and multi-term computing power contracts, support flexible adjustment of investment strategies according to personal needs and market dynamics. Professional teams ensure stable operation of the system and ensure continuous and reliable returns. 5. High-frequency settlement, fast return on investment The settlement frequency is high, mining income can be obtained every day, and the investment return cycle is short. Compared with the traditional model, the efficiency of capital recovery and value-added is significantly improved, and the efficiency of capital use is optimized. Why has AIXA Miner become the common choice of 5 million users? Three core advantages build an industry high ground AIXA Miner leads the cloud mining innovation with a computing power network driven by efficient and clean energy.

2025-06-10T08:44:37,"Bitcoin Hyper Presale Breaks $1M: $139K Crypto Whale Heats Up the Action for the First Ever $BTC Layer-2 with SVM","The Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) token presale hit $1M today, marking a significant milestone in this promising Layer 2 project. Particularly exciting is a series of buys totaling $139K just a few hours ago. This signals growing interest in the project, which is currently running one of the best presales of the year. With Bitcoin ($BTC) reaching an all-time high just weeks ago, signs are pointing to another surge soon. Institutions are snapping up more $BTC and the likes of ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood continue to be bullish on the world’s biggest crypto. Because of this, it’s no surprise that Bitcoin-related projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) are grabbing headlines and snagging whale buys these days. But what is it really and why would anyone spend $139 on the project? Bitcoin Hyper: Taking Bitcoin to the Next Level Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the first SVM-based Layer 2 (L2) for Bitcoin that aims to solve common issues with $BTC, such as slow transactions, high fees, and lack of native support for smart contracts or dApps. Powering it is the all-time team of Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and the decentralized Canonical Bridge , which enables the creation of fast, cheap, and composable dApps while preserving Bitcoin’s robust security. The result is a combination of lightning-fast transactions executed on the L2 and settlement on the L1 for additional security. You get high-throughput, low-cost settlements, and almost no congestion (on a blockchain known for its slow speed). By bridging $BTC to wrapped $BTC on the L2, users can participate in the Bitcoin Hyper ecosystem. And you can withdraw back to native $BTC at any time, so there are no strings attached. Solana developers will also have a much easier time scaling dApps and smart contracts on Bitcoin, something previously thought to be impossible or extraordinarily hard to achieve. The five-phase roadmap will see the mainnet launch in Q3 2025, when the L2 will be fully deployed. With an ecosystem expansion in Q4 (including a developer toolkit with API and SDK), the project is turning out to be one of the most promising altcoins this year. $HYPER Token & Presale Info $HYPER is the project’s native token. You can use it for all transaction and smart contract fees, participate in DAO decisions and community proposals, and unlock exclusive perks. Alternatively, you can stake it to earn APY rewards while helping secure the Bitcoin Hyper network. Currently priced at $0.011825, you can get $HYPER at the official Bitcoin Hyper presale page . Just connect your crypto wallet (e.g., Best Wallet ) to the presale widget, enter the number of tokens you want to buy, and pay with your credit/debit card or crypto ($ETH, $USDT, $USDC, and $BNB are accepted). You can check out our Bitcoin Hyper buying guide for more details. You can also stake your tokens and a 727% APY p/a. To date, investors have staked over 72.1M $HYPER tokens, with the number increasing by the hour. $HYPER has a total supply of 21B tokens of which the project team has allocated 30% for development. This puts the project and its token in a good position to see exponential growth, with $HYPER potentially reaching $1.50 in 2030 . This would mean a 126x in less than five years, and that’s not counting the $HYPER rewards from staking. The presale has raised $1,007,959 as of the writing of this article, and the price will increase in 11 hours. The Time is Right for Bitcoin Hyper As Bitcoin adoption should increase in the coming months and years, with more and more companies adopting it as strategic reserves, low cap coins like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) are at right place and time to capitalize on this momentum. That’s why it’s hardly surprising that it broke $1M just hours ago. Once launched, the Bitcoin Hyper L2 will bring the speed, scalability, and more affordable transaction costs that Bitcoin needs to meet growing demand. Always remember to do your own research.

2025-06-10T08:34:25,"Solana Listed on Nasdaq as Solaxy, the First SOL Layer-2, Raises $46M","The NASDAQ has been bringing crypto and traditional investing together since 2025. With the June 7 filing of a standard K-8 fund , the Nasdaq noted that its standard Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index (NCIUS) would add four new cryptos – Cardano, Solana, Stellar Lumens, and XRP Ledger – to its current roster of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The move sets up the potential for the first-ever multi-asset crypto ETF, and signals crypto’s continued ascension to the upper ranks of the financial world. The news comes on the back of reports that BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF just became the fastest-ever ETF to reach $70B in total assets. Add it all together, and it’s clear that the finance world has expanded beyond recognizing just $BTC and $ETH. Solana’s $83.7B market cap could be set to swell even further on the back of a potential Nasdaq listing and possible ETF inclusion. And any growth could skyrocket when critical upgrades like Solaxy, Solana’s first-ever Layer-2, provide a much-needed boost to Solana scalability and reliability. ETFs: Kind Of A Big Deal Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are pools of assets listed on exchanges, letting ordinary investors gain exposure to the underlying assets without purchasing them directly. That makes them great for retail investors who may not want the struggle of setting up a crypto wallet – even a simple wallet like Best Wallet app . However, ETFs are also appealing to institutional investors, who use ETFs to diversify their portfolios. $BTC and $ETH ETFs both caused a spike in the price of their respective cryptos when they launched last year, and have been widely credited with fueling a steady increase in demand. Currently, $BTC ETFs account for 6% of the total Bitcoin market cap; $ETH ETFs hold 3.13%. In both cases, that’s a significant percentage of the total market cap and adds buying pressure. A potential multi-asset ETF, from Nasdaq, no less, would do the same for any included cryptos, including Solana. Solana’s Ecosystem Set to Expand Solana has historically relied on a single Rust-based validator client. That was Agave, maintained by Anza, with over 90% of stake weight running on Jito-Solana, a fork built around MEV infrastructure . The Jito-Solana consolidation boosted performance and staking returns, but raised concerns that a failure at a single point could severely disrupt the network. In a positive sign, several competing clients are emerging: Jito‑Solana: the original MEV solution, which jump-started the trend of validator innovation Firedancer: developed by Jump Crypto, aimed at blazing-fast, modular performance Sig: Syndica’s rewrite in Zig, optimized for read-heavy workloads common in dApps Paladin: a lightweight MEV-focused fork of Jito featuring a protected ‘P3’ transaction lane to mitigate sandwich attacks and enhance fairness TinyDancer: an open-source light client designed for mobile environments, with SPV verification, data sampling, and fraud proofing Taken together, these clients represent a maturing Solana ecosystem: each addresses specific limitations and contributes to greater resilience, specialization, and decentralization. They lay the groundwork for further development on a Solana network that has seen some of the best meme coins and new crypto presales launched in recent years. And now there’s another improvement on the way, just in time for any potential ETF: the first-ever Solana Layer-2 solution, Solaxy. Solaxy ($SOLX): First-Ever Solana Layer-2 for Zero Down-Time Why have investors poured $46M into the Solaxy ($SOLX) presale so far? Because the potential for a Layer 2 solution that solves some of Solana’s nagging problems – like failed transactions and network congestion – is simply too great to miss. The Solaxy project brings together aspects of Ethereum’s scalability and reliability, blending them with Solana’s faster network speeds and lower transaction costs. The $SOLX token will be multi-chain, launching on Ethereum and bridging to the Solaxy Layer-2 when fully deployed. In the meantime, the project is already well underway. The Solaxy Block Explorer and Bridge are live on the testnet. And the token launch is imminent; there are only six days left in the presale. Any investors eager to get in early on what could be the next generation of Solana development can check out our guide on how to buy Solaxy . Tokens currently cost $0.00175, but our price prediction shows the potential for the token to hit $0.025 by the end of 2025, a 1300% increase. Visit the Solaxy presale page today . Nasdaq Listing Positions Solana – and Solaxy – As Financial Cornerstones With Nasdaq listing Solana in its crypto index and a potential ETF on the horizon, institutional demand could surge. Paired with the emergence of Solaxy , Solana is no longer just fast – it’s becoming foundational, and a core part of crypto finance. Do your own research before investing; this is not financial advice. But be aware – time’s running out to get in on the ground floor, with under a week left in the Solaxy presale.",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana-listed-on-nasdaq-as-solaxy-the-first-sol-layer-2-raises-46m/,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|SOL","Cryptocurrency Market News",cryptocompare
2025-06-10T08:32:45,"Will Bitcoin Price Hit ATH in the Next 24 Hours?","The post Will Bitcoin Price Hit ATH in the Next 24 Hours? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin is back on the move and is on the brink of making history again. At the time of publication, the BTC price is hovering around $109,418.91, up 3.62% since yesterday. Successively, its market cap has risen to $2.17 trillion, while the daily trading volume has surged by over 46%. With Bitcoin now just a few percentage points away from surpassing the current ATH, marketers are stressing out on one single question: Will Bitcoin price hit the ATH in the next 24 hours? Let us decode the quest in this Bitcoin price analysis. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis: What’s Next? Bitcoin’s current pace is boosted by consecutive breakouts above crucial resistance levels. It is worth noting that, once BTC price crossed $106,500, it quickly rallied to the $110,000 mark, a move that analyst Michael Van de Poppe rightly anticipated. According to him, the breakout above $108,900 accelerated price action further, with a peak now seen at $110,561. A brief sideways trend, as seen in the past, typically follows such parabolic moves. This could mean Bitcoin might hover near current levels or slightly correct before launching toward new highs. The RSI on the hourly chart hints at temporary exhaustion, but the structure remains bullish. The ideal zone to buy remains between $107,000 and $108,000, a support area noted for strong continuation potential. Liquidity pools below $105,500 could also serve as a bounce region if prices retrace further. If current momentum sustains and dips remain shallow, Bitcoin breaching ATH levels within the next 24 hours is not just possible, but highly probable. Curious about how Bitcoin could close the year? Read our Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! FAQs Q1: What is Bitcoin’s all-time high (ATH)? A: Bitcoin’s ATH is $111,970.17. Q2: Is now a good time to buy Bitcoin? A: Analyst insights suggest the $107,000–$108,000 range is ideal for dip-buying, making current levels attractive. Q3: Will Bitcoin hit a new ATH in 24 hours?

Knowing how to choose a crypto exchange for beginners is essential, as crypto exchanges serve as the central platforms for buying, selling, and managing crypto assets. Whether trading Bitcoin for the first time or planning future trades, the exchange chosen will shape the overall user and trading experience. Centralized vs. Decentralized Crypto Exchanges Crypto exchanges fall into two broad categories: centralized (CEX) and decentralized exchanges (DEX) . A CEX is run by an organization that oversees user funds and facilitates transactions, much like a traditional bank. In contrast, decentralized crypto exchanges operate on smart contracts and give users complete control over their assets. While full control over assets may sound appealing, DEX platforms can be complex and challenging for beginners. They often require technical knowledge and manual processes that may overwhelm new users. For this reason, CEXs are generally better suited to those just starting out, offering more accessible interfaces and support to ease the learning curve. Security Protocols Security is a major concern when choosing a crypto exchange. A secure platform protects customer assets through advanced safety measures. Reputable crypto exchanges typically store over 90% of user funds in cold storage—offline wallets that are less vulnerable to hacking attempts. In addition to secure storage practices , users should investigate an exchange’s history with security incidents. A good track record can provide peace of mind and reduce the risk of potential breaches. Liquidity Liquidity is another vital factor. It refers to how easily and quickly assets can be bought or sold without impacting the market price. High liquidity ensures that trades are executed efficiently, even during high market volatility or when making large transactions. Platforms with strong liquidity allow new users to enter and exit positions without unnecessary delays or slippage, which is especially helpful when learning the basics of trading. Fees and Costs While the trading volume for beginner crypto traders may be small initially, understanding the fee structure of an exchange is important for long-term success. Even competitive fees on many exchanges can accumulate over time and reduce overall returns. Users should consider a range of potential charges, including: Deposit Fees: Often applied when adding fiat currency to the account. These fees vary depending on the payment method. Withdrawal Fees: Charges incurred when removing funds from the platform. Blockchain Fees: Also known as gas fees, these costs are related to transaction processing on the blockchain and are often outside the exchange’s control. Inactivity Fees: Some platforms charge monthly fees if an account remains unused for a specific period. Subscription Fees: Premium features or advanced tools for experienced traders may come with additional costs. Reviewing these charges in advance helps beginner crypto traders choose platforms that align with their trading goals. Region Availability Regulatory restrictions can limit access to certain crypto exchanges based on the user’s location. Many platforms prohibit users from countries like the United States, Russia, Venezuela, Hong Kong, and Ecuador due to legal and compliance issues. However, such restrictions can change as laws evolve. It is crucial to verify whether a platform is available in your region before creating an account and to stay updated on changing regulations through official channels. User Interface and Experience A clear and simple interface is essential for those new to crypto. Many crypto exchanges offer beginner-friendly dashboards that eliminate unnecessary jargon and prioritize ease of use. Some platforms feature tools like Bybit’s One-Click Buy option, designed to simplify the buying process. These features are valuable for users unfamiliar with complex trading platforms and terminology. Educational Materials Educational support plays a key role in helping beginner crypto traders succeed and improve their trading skills. Top crypto exchanges provide resources such as step-by-step guides, instructional videos, and blog articles tailored to new users. A thorough FAQ section and help center can resolve common issues and clarify features, making it easier for users to navigate their first transactions and gain confidence. Customer Support Strong customer support is critical, especially for new traders. Mistakes such as sending funds to the wrong wallet or account access issues can occur, and timely assistance is essential. Crypto exchanges with responsive customer service teams offer multiple support channels via email, live chat, or phone. User reviews can be a reliable indicator of a reputable exchange and availability of support offered by the platform. Which is the best crypto exchange for new traders? For new users entering crypto markets, Coinbase is considered one of the best crypto exchanges for beginners. It offers a clean interface, clear navigation, and simplified tools for buying and selling crypto, similar to Bybit’s One-Click Buy feature. Coinbase supports popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum and provides access to educational resources, helping users understand crypto markets. Its integration with payment methods such as credit cards and fiat transfers allows easy fiat-to-crypto purchases, which is critical for those just starting out. Binance ranks as the runner-up due to its wide range of features and competitive trading fees. Binance.US is often compared to Kraken and offers services like staking, cold-wallet storage, and tools for both new and experienced traders. It also has a lite mode that allows beginners and new crypto traders to trade without getting lost in advanced options/settings. However, it has faced regulatory scrutiny. Despite this, it remains one of the most popular choices for beginners due to its strong liquidity and low-cost structure. For users who prefer a more direct and straightforward approach, wallets like Phantom and MetaMask offer built-in purchasing options. Both allow users to buy cryptocurrencies directly through their respective app. Phantom supports networks such as Solana, Ethereum, and Polygon, and MetaMask allows the management of Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens. These wallets are accessible via mobile apps and browsers and are suited for those who want to manage assets and transfer crypto without using a centralized exchange. With options to pay using credit cards, debit cards, or fiat currency transfers, both wallets simplify the entry process for those who are new to crypto.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/best-crypto-exchanges-for-beginners/,"BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|TRADING","Cryptocurrency Guides",cryptocompare

It is now the fastest ETF ever to hit that mark in only trading 341 days, he said before adding that this is five times faster than the previous record held by the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD), which reached that AUM figure after 1,691 days. According to the BlackRock website , the fund’s AUM is $71.8 billion, and it held 661,457 BTC as of June 6. $IBIT just blew through $70b and is now the fastest ETF to ever hit that mark in only 341 days, which is 5x faster than the old record held by GLD of 1,691 days. Nice chart from @JackiWang17 pic.twitter.com/5VeGT9twpQ — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 9, 2025 Institutional Hunger For BTC Institutional investors are leading this rally through funds such as IBIT , as retail remains largely absent. Moreover, IBIT has only seen three outflow days since early April as the fund continues to accumulate the asset aggressively . When BlackRock filed for IBIT, the price of Bitcoin was around $30,000, “and the stench of FTX was still in the air,” remarked Balchunas on June 10. He added that the asset is now trading at $110,000, which is a return of seven times that of the S&P 500, “and is now seen as legitimate for other big investors.” ETF Store President Nate Geraci also commented on the milestone, reminding people that there are eleven other spot Bitcoin ETFs and the sector overall has almost $125 billion in AUM. These are “ridiculous numbers,” he said. What a chart… IBIT hits $70bil in 341 trading days. No other ETF even close. And remember… there are 11 other spot btc ETFs. Category overall is nearly $125bil. Ridiculous numbers. via @EricBalchunas pic.twitter.com/dMHlo7wFTI — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) June 9, 2025 Monday saw a reverse of outflows with a net aggregate inflow of $386 million for the eleven funds, according to Coinglass. BlackRock had a lower-than-usual day with just $121 million in inflows, beaten by Fidelity, which saw $173 million in inflows. The largest Bitcoin holder is estimated to be its pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, who holds around 1.1 million coins. However, Balchunas et al believe that BlackRock could surpass this total by mid-2026 if assets continue to flow in. Bitcoin Price Outlook The reversal of ETF flows coincided with a jump in spot markets, which saw Bitcoin reach an intraday high of $110,260 in early trading in Asia on Tuesday. The asset had dipped to $109,500 at the time of writing but remained up 3.6% on the day. Bitcoin is now just 2% away from notching another new all-time high.

2025-06-10T08:17:32,"Crypto Stocks Climb as Public Companies Accelerate Bitcoin Accumulation","U.S. crypto-linked stocks saw gains across the board on Monday, as Bitcoin prices rebounded and more public companies announced new Bitcoin purchases for their treasuries. The upward trend reflects growing investor confidence in digital assets, particularly among publicly traded firms seeking to leverage Bitcoin as a strategic financial asset. Leading the day’s movement was Nasdaq’s recent entrant, Circle Internet Group (CRCL), which jumped 7% and rose another 2.2% in after-hours trading, closing at $117.79. Major crypto miners followed suit. Core Scientific Inc. (CORZ) rose 4.27%, with a slight 0.87% bump after market close. Competitors CleanSpark Inc. (CLSK) and MARA Holdings Inc. (MARA) each climbed over 3%, with both stocks ticking up another 1% in after-hours activity. Riot Platforms Inc. (RIOT) also added 2.74% during the day, followed by a 1.2% increase after-hours. These gains coincided with Bitcoin’s own 4% surge to $110,150, edging closer to its record high of $112,000 set on May 22. Market sentiment appeared to improve amid reports of U.S.–China trade discussions held in the UK. Mixed Results for Trading Platforms’ Stocks Not all crypto-related stocks enjoyed Monday’s rally. Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD) was among the few laggards, falling nearly 2% to $73.40 after being left out of the S&P 500 index during its latest rebalancing. The omission came as a disappointment to investors who had speculated on Robinhood’s inclusion, a move that often brings a boost in share price due to increased institutional interest. In contrast, rival trading platform eToro Group Ltd. (ETOR), which recently went public , surged 10.5% and climbed another 2.4% after hours to $77.79. American crypto exchange giant Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) posted a modest 2% gain to $256.63, reflecting steady investor support amid the broader market uptrend. Bitcoin Holdings Fuel Investor Confidence Several public firms continue to embrace Bitcoin as a reserve asset. MicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR), already one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin, gained 4.71% and added over 1% in after-hours trading to reach $396.61. Meanwhile, BitMine Immersion Technologies Inc. (BMNR) became the latest firm to jump on the Bitcoin bandwagon, announcing the purchase of 100 BTC following an $18 million share offering. Despite the news, BMNR fell 8.7% before slightly rebounding by 5.2% after hours to $7.25. Energy tech company KULR Technology Group Inc. (KULR) also made headlines after announcing it had purchased another $13 million in Bitcoin, raising its total holdings to 920 BTC at an average price of $98,760 per coin. Its stocks responded positively, climbing 4.2% on the day.

2025-06-10T08:14:43,"Robert Kiyosaki Warns of ‘Civil War,’ Suggests Bitcoin, Gold, Silver Amid Financial Turmoil","Key Takeaways: Robert Kiyosaki warns of civil unrest in the U.S., calling it the start of a “fourth turning.” He blames central banks for eroding public wealth and urges investing in Bitcoin, gold, and silver. Kiyosaki predicts Bitcoin could reach $1 million within a decade as trust in fiat declines. Robert Kiyosaki, author of the influential book Rich Dad Poor Dad , has issued a stark warning about rising unrest in the United States, drawing connections between violent incidents and deeper economic turmoil. In a recent post on X , Kiyosaki declared, “Civil War has begun. ICE raids in Los Angeles erupt into mass violence… I believe we and the world are in for a long, hot violent summer.” The statement comes amid growing political division and economic instability. Kiyosaki Links U.S. Unrest to ‘Fourth Turning’ Crisis Cycle Kiyosaki tied the unrest to what historians William Strauss and Neil Howe have described as the “fourth turning,” a cyclical period of crisis that reshapes the fabric of society. Previous fourth turnings, according to the theory, include the Great Depression and World War II, the Civil War, and the American Revolution. Kiyosaki suggests that the current upheaval will be driven by public backlash against central banking practices, especially the sustained printing of money and inflationary policies. He argues that these policies erode public wealth, framing them as a form of institutional theft. “The issue is our bankers are stealing the wealth of the people via fake money, counterfeit money the central bankers print,” he wrote. He added that this era is ending, and that people should turn to alternative stores of value. As a solution, Kiyosaki is urging individuals to protect their financial futures by investing in hard assets. “Sound money, gold, silver, and Bitcoin take away the power from the corrupt bankers,” he noted. He describes gold and silver as “God’s money” and Bitcoin as “people’s money.” CIVIL WAR has begun. ICE raids in Los Angeles erupt into mass violence. BIG QUESTION: Will it spread? MY ANSWER: I believe we and the world are in for a long, hot, violent summer. This turmoil is described in the FOURTH TURNING by Strauss and Howe, who posit that society… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) June 9, 2025 Kiyosaki’s latest comments reinforce his long-standing belief that traditional financial systems are broken. Amid warnings of prolonged violence and social disruption, he advocates for individual financial sovereignty, calling on followers to “become your own bank” and stop saving “fake money.” Kiyosaki Sees $1M Bitcoin by Next Decade A longtime advocate of hard assets, Kiyosaki sees Bitcoin as a modern hedge against inflation and a tool for preserving wealth over time. In his latest prediction , Kiyosaki said he “strongly believes” the Bitcoin price will reach $180,000 to $200,000 by the end of this year. Over the next decade, he sees BTC at $1 million, gold at $30,000 per ounce, and silver at $3,000. Notably, Kiyosaki is not the only one expressing confidence in Bitcoin’s future. As reported, Shunyet Jan, Head of Derivatives at Bybit, has projected that Bitcoin could reach $125,000 by the end of Q2 if current trends persist. Likewise, crypto analyst Scott Melker has said he believes Bitcoin could surge to $250,000 by the end of 2025 , driven by institutional demand and a maturing market structure.

Developed by Input Output, the research and development team behind Cardano, Cardinal allows Bitcoin ( BTC ) holders to access DeFi services such as lending, staking, and borrowing without using traditional custodians or centralized bridges. Welcome to the first Bitcoin DeFi protocol developed for Cardano https://t.co/CoYvrYnIfI — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) June 9, 2025 Cardinal functions by wrapping Bitcoin, particularly its unspent transaction outputs. UTXOs are bits of Bitcoin that have been left over from transactions and are used to represent ownership. They are converted into wrapped tokens by the protocol, which maintains a 1:1 peg with Bitcoin. Users can redeem their wrapped BTC at any time through a secure, fraud-resistant process. What makes Cardinal different from typical wrapped Bitcoin solutions is its trust-minimized structure. Instead of depending on a central custodian or federated system, Cardinal uses MuSig2, a cryptographic system that allows multiple parties to sign transactions together. This ensures that the original Bitcoin stays locked on its native chain and that the system functions securely, even if only one participant is honest. You might also like: Brave Wallet expands support with Cardano integration Another key feature is Cardinal’s approach to rehypothecation. In traditional finance and some crypto systems, rehypothecation allows custodians to reuse user assets, often without full transparency. Cardinal avoids this by allowing users complete control over their assets while preserving the original Bitcoin. In addition, the protocol makes use of BitVMX, an off-chain execution system that maintains decentralization while enabling complex Bitcoin operations. This configuration facilitates safe, easy asset transfers between the two networks when paired with Cardano smart contracts and Bitcoin’s built-in scripting capabilities. The project was showcased during a live demo at the Bitcoin 2025 conference, where IO performed a bridgeless BTC-to-Cardano transfer using BitVMX. The event marked a major step in Cardano’s efforts to become a platform for Bitcoin-native applications. Despite recent progress, Cardano’s DeFi total value locked has declined, from peak of $415 million in May to around $334 million by June 10, as per DefiLlama data . The team hopes Cardinal will help bring in new liquidity by offering Bitcoin holders more ways to use their assets within a DeFi environment, without leaving the Bitcoin ecosystem.

2025-06-10T08:09:40,"FOMC Meeting June 18: Crypto Market Prepares for No FED Rate Cut Decision","The post FOMC Meeting June 18: Crypto Market Prepares for No FED Rate Cut Decision appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin is hovering above $108,000, gaining over 2% in the past 24 hours. The crypto market overall is holding a solid $3.38 trillion valuation. But as investors gear up for the next big Federal Reserve meeting on June 18, many are starting to temper their expectations, especially when it comes to interest rate cuts. No FED Rate Cuts—At Least Not Yet For months, traders expected the Fed to begin cutting rates by summer. But recent job data changed the mood. Hiring remains strong, and inflation is still running above the Fed’s comfort level. That gives the central bank little reason to ease up on its current policy. The CME FedWatch Tool now shows a 99.9% chance the Fed will keep rates steady in June, with just a 0.1% chance of a 25 basis point cut. Looking to July, the odds of a rate cut sit at just 14.5%. Back in May, those chances were much higher, showing how much sentiment has shifted in just a few weeks. Trump, ECB Push for Cuts—but Fed Holds Its Ground The pressure is building on the Fed. The European Central Bank just cut its interest rates by 25 basis points. And Donald Trump is calling for a much more aggressive 100 bps rate cut in the U.S., saying it would be “rocket fuel” for the economy. He’s also criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell and hinted that Kevin Warsh could replace him. Still, the Fed remains cautious. Officials are watching how tariffs and inflation will affect the economy before making any big moves. So for now, it looks like interest rates will stay between 425–450 basis points for the foreseeable future. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : U.S. CPI Report to Decide Crypto’s Next Move – Will the Fed Hold Back? , How Crypto Is Reacting Crypto markets are in a bit of a mixed mood. Bitcoin and Gold are showing strength, and some traders are shifting out of the U.S. dollar into riskier assets like crypto. According to Sergei Gorev from Youhodler , this trend is helping keep Bitcoin’s price elevated. But not all signs are bullish. Gorev also points out that Bitcoin’s chart is showing a potential “ Head and Shoulders” pattern , which, if it plays out, could pull prices down to around $92,000. With the FOMC meeting coming up and inflation data on the way, the crypto market is walking a fine line between optimism and caution. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) sets U.S. monetary policy, including interest rates. The next meeting is June 17-18, 2025, where markets widely expect rates to remain steady given current economic data. How does the FOMC’s interest rate decision affect the crypto market? If the Fed holds rates steady (or raises them), it can dampen risk appetite for assets like crypto, leading to range-bound prices or slight dips. Lower rates generally boost crypto by making borrowing cheaper and increasing market liquidity. What are the short-term and long-term crypto market reactions to FOMC decisions? Short-term, crypto can see volatility based on the Fed’s “hawkish” (cautious) or “dovish” (easing) tone. Long-term, a “higher for longer” rate scenario might limit investment, but any easing signals could be a catalyst for price increases.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/fomc-meeting-june-18-crypto-market-prepares-for-no-fed-rate-cut-decision/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare

2025-06-10T08:00:23,"Bitcoin Defies Bears: Price Nears $108,000 Despite $250M Exchange Inflows","On-chain data shows the exchanges recently received a large amount of Bitcoin inflows, but so far, the asset’s price has only been going up. Bitcoin Has Seen A Spike In Exchange Inflows Recently In a new post on X, the institutional DeFi solutions provider Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) has talked about the latest trend in the Exchange Netflow for Bitcoin. The Exchange Netflow is an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the net amount of the asset that’s moving into or out of the wallets associated with all centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric is positive, it means the exchange inflows outweigh the exchange outflows. As one of the main reasons why investors would deposit their coins to these platforms is for selling-related purposes, this kind of trend can have a bearish impact on the asset’s price. Related Reading: Bitcoin & Ethereum Diverge—ETF Flows Just Flipped The Narrative On the other hand, the indicator being under the zero mark suggests the holders are taking out a net number of tokens from exchanges. Such a trend can be a sign that the investors are accumulating, which can naturally prove to be bullish for the cryptocurrency. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Exchange Netflow since the start of the month: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Exchange Netflow has recently mostly been contained in the negative territory, but the latest value (yesterday’s) has been positive. In total, the investors have deposited a net $262.75 million of the asset to the exchange-connected wallets with this inflow spike. According to the analytics firm, this marks the first day of significant deposits since May 27th. As mentioned before, exchange inflows are something that can turn out to be bearish for the coin’s value. So far, however, the opposite has happened for Bitcoin, as its price has soared instead. This could indicate that even if there are some large holders looking to sell with these deposits, enough demand has surfaced at the same time that BTC has not only been able to ride out this wave of potential selling pressure, but actually add to its recovery. Related Reading: Crypto Suffers $1 Billion Flush As Musk-Trump Feud Shakes Bitcoin According to the analytics firm Glassnode, short liquidations have registered a notable uptick alongside this surge in the cryptocurrency. “Over just 4 hours, total short liquidations spiked from $105K to $359K (24H SMA),” notes Glassnode. Generally, large liquidations end up providing fuel to the price move that caused them, so in this case, it’s possible the short squeeze may have provided support to the Bitcoin rally. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $107,900, up over 3% in the last seven days.

2025-06-10T08:00:00,"BTC News: Bitcoin Solaris Raises $3.8M in Presale, Early Investors Set for 233% Returns at Launch","In a cycle filled with speculation and recycled promises, Bitcoin Solaris has raised $3.8 million not through hype, but through a model that shows its math. Phase 6 is now live at $6 per token, and the next major step is a centralized exchange listing projected at $20 — a 233% increase for current participants. What stands out isn’t the jump alone. It’s the framework supporting it. Bitcoin Solaris isn’t launching on paper. It’s backed by active audits, functioning mechanics, and a sharply defined 21 million token cap. That’s what’s drawing capital — not influencers, not empty ads, but protocol-level logic. What Powers This Demand? Every strong presale has a reason it doesn’t need to push marketing gimmicks. For Bitcoin Solaris, that reason is structural. The token isn’t diluted by staking inflation or burdened with team-controlled emissions. Only 4.2 million BTC-S have been designated for presale across all phases: there is no secret allocation, and no dev wallet minting event waiting down the line. The blockchain itself operates on a hybrid architecture: a base consensus layer combining Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Capacity, paired with a high-throughput Solaris Layer running Proof-of-History and Proof-of-Time. Together, this system clears over 10,000 transactions per second with a finality time of two seconds — all while consuming 99.95% less energy than traditional mining. Audited. Verified. Positioned. Both Cyberscope and Freshcoins have completed independent audits of the protocol and mobile infrastructure. Smart contracts, consensus logic, and application data have been tested for both security and performance compliance. Cyberscope Audit PDF Freshcoins Audit PDF KYC Verification This level of pre-launch transparency isn’t typical — and it’s exactly why capital is flowing. The protocol doesn’t rely on trust. It shows its work. Analyst Attention Is Already Here Ben Crypto , a known figure in crypto forecasting, recently spotlighted Bitcoin Solaris in a full analysis, citing its scarcity mechanics and audit-backed infrastructure as reasons the token could easily cross $100 within 24 months. That analysis is based on a functioning ecosystem with working code, a defined user base, and a presale designed to reward early participants — not trap them in vesting cliffs or delayed unlocks. $6 Entry Is Still Open Bitcoin Solaris is still in Phase 6 of its presale. BTC-S tokens are available at $6 for a limited window before the project moves to centralized listing and public exposure. With benchmarks set for $20 upon launch, the entry spread is what’s driving urgency. Investors aren’t waiting on marketing events or big promises. They’re entering a network where functionality is live, and the multiplier is locked in by math — not guesswork.

2025-06-10T07:33:37,"UK plans to recover cryptocurrencies tied to bankruptcy cases","The Insolvency Service (IS) appointed former police investigator Andrew Small as its first dedicated crypto intelligence specialist to help recover digital assets for the UK economy from bankruptcy and criminal cases. Small will help track crypto assets lost in criminal cases and provide the agency with detailed knowledge of the crypto market. The IS claimed that the number of insolvency cases involving crypto as a recoverable asset rose by 420% in the past five years, with 59 cases in 2024/25 compared to 14 in 2019/20. The estimated value of crypto assets identified in insolvency cases also skyrocketed 364x to more than £520K (~$710K) in 2024/25, from just a little over £1K in 2019/20. A 2024 study by the Financial Conduct Authority claimed that crypto assets had risen in popularity in recent years. It found that seven million adults in the UK, almost 12% of the population, held some form of crypto, up from 3.2 million adults (4.4%) in 2021. Special agent Small said there was a rapid rise in crypto ownership in the UK and a similar rise in crypto assets lost in bankruptcy and criminal cases. His work will focus on helping the Insolvency Service trace, assess, and recover crypto holdings from individuals and companies subject to insolvency proceedings.

He will be responsible for tracing and identifying digital assets in bankruptcy and criminal cases. The role, based within the agency’s… — CryptOpus (@ImCryptOpus) June 9, 2025 Crypto specialist Small explained that the Insolvency Service had a duty to trace and recover money and assets from individuals or companies in insolvency cases and work to return as much money owed to creditors as possible. The Official Receiver Service, a key part of the Insolvency Service, identified £523,580 of crypto assets across 59 insolvency cases in 2024/25, compared to just £1,436 of crypto across 14 cases in 2019/20. Andrew’s new crypto asset intelligence role will be based within the Insolvency Service’s Investigation and Enforcement Services team, meaning he will primarily focus on crypto asset ownership in criminal cases. Neil Freebury, head of intelligence at the Insolvency Service, said Andrew brought a wealth of knowledge to this role and his previous experience as an economic crime investigator within the police. Freebury added that Andrew’s appointment would help IS investigators dealing with cases where crypto was a factor. “Crypto is very much a recoverable asset, and my role will help the agency by providing specialist knowledge about the types of crypto assets available and the associated technology used to buy, sell, and store them.” – Andrew Small , Crypto Intelligence Specialist at the Insolvency Services The IS was keen on Bitcoin, Ethereum , DOGE, Litecoin, and Non-fungible tokens (NFTs). However, Freebury pointed out that the number of insolvency cases involving crypto asset ownership rose four-fold in the past five years as crypto grew in popularity. UK to collect specific crypto user and transaction data starting next year The UK government will require crypto companies operating in the country to collect user and transaction information from 1 January 2026. The HM Revenue & Customs announced last week that the UK government’s data collection plan will follow the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) Crypto Asset Reporting Framework (CARF). The HMRC also said crypto firms may start collecting information earlier to be ready when the new rules come into force. For individual users, the required data will include the user’s name, date of birth, home address, country of residence, National Insurance number or Unique Taxpayer Reference (for UK residents), and the tax identification number (TIN) along with the country where it was issued (for non-UK residents). For entity users, companies must collect the legal business name, main business address, registration number (for UK firms), and the TIN and issuing country (for non-UK firms). In some cases, platforms must also gather details of the company’s controlling persons. Firms must also report sender and recipient names, addresses, tax IDs & full trade details (token type, quantity, GBP value, & timestamp). Failure to provide accurate, complete, or verified reports could result in penalties of up to £300 per user. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

2025-06-10T07:33:35,"Fartcoin breaks out as golden cross and shark pattern point to $2 rally ahead","Fartcoin could potentially see significant gains ahead amid hype surrounding an upcoming spot listing on Coinbase. According to data from crypto.news, Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ) shot up 22% to an intraday high of $1.26 on June 10, morning Asian time, pushing its market cap past $1.23 billion, enough to flip Dogwifhat ( WIF ) in rankings. Open interest in Fartcoin’s futures market also reached an all-time high of $713 million today, indicating that traders are heavily speculating on further price movements. The long/short ratio on major exchanges is also above 1, signaling more traders are betting long than short, a bullish sign overall. Much of today’s gains followed after Coinbase confirmed plans to list Fartcoin perpetual futures on both its Advanced and International Exchange platforms, starting June 12 at 9:30 AM UTC. Although it’s just the futures for now, traders believe a spot listing could follow, especially since Coinbase had previously added Fartcoin to its assets roadmap on June 6.

Fartcoin price analysis On the technical side, FARTCOIN has broken out from the upper edge of a broadening wedge pattern on the 4-hour USDT chart, a setup that’s often seen as a bullish reversal signal. FARTCOIN 20-day and 50-day SMA chart — June 10 | Source: crypto.news After the breakout, it seems to have found strong support in the $0.86–$0.93 zone. The 20-day simple moving average has crossed above the 50-day, forming what analysts call a golden cross, which usually suggests a continuation of upward momentum. Meanwhile, both the RSI and Stochastic Oscillator are pointing up, hinting that buying pressure is building. FARTCOIN MACD and RSI chart — June 10 | Source: crypto.news Technical analyst Waleed Ahmed also pointed out that FARTCOIN has broken out of a bullish Shark Harmonic pattern, which often signals a strong move to the upside. Given this setup, the next key target appears to be around $1.38, which lines up with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level. If FARTCOIN breaks above that, bulls may aim for the $2 mark, roughly a 60% gain from current levels. That said, there’s still some risk on the way. According to Nansen data, while the top 100 holders have been adding to their FARTCOIN bags, many smart money wallets and whales have been selling over the last 30 days. Exchange balances are also up 18%, raising concerns about a possible sell-off in the near term. Source: Nansen If FARTCOIN fails to stay above the important $1 psychological support, sellers could try to drag it down to $0.50, which would mean a 60% drop from where it’s currently trading.

2025-06-10T07:19:00,"Crypto’s Next Big Success Might Just Be Neo Pepe ($NEOP)","This Year’s Best Token Presale Hands-Down Crypto investors and analysts have been focusing their attention on the new project Neo Pepe ($NEOP), identifying it as one of the best-performing tokens among the crypto projects launched in 2025. This crypto project is not just built on hype or inspired by the meme industry, Neo Pepe was built to be decentralized and a token going against the traditional financial systems and their market controls. As financial markets become more regulated, Neo Pepe offers a better option that is designed for transparency, community governance, and decentralization. As the market continues to anticipate new projects, Neo Pepe is positioned as another entry into the market but with more transformative potential that investors can relate to due to its focus on freedom and financial independence. Experts Can’t Be -More- Excited For This Presale Crypto experts are anticipating the strong narrative backing Neo Pepe’s economic mechanism. Investors see the project as an opportunity, with its token possessing the ability to resist centralized financial controls with profit-oriented features. Its scheduled token unlock ensures that the market circulation is balanced, reducing the risks associated with the launch of new tokens. In addition, its auto-liquidity mechanism assures investors that the value of the token can be sustained, making it the best choice of presale in 2025 for investors. Another attractive feature is the ability of the project to carry its community along in decisions through voting and governance. This allows quick adaptation that is in line with the project’s laid down guidelines in terms of its investors and community choices, a big difference from traditional digital assets. Encouraging Tokenomics at Foundation Neo Pepe’s tokenomics sets it apart in the crypto industry. The tokenomics was set up to accommodate its presale, which will take place in 16 phases, moving the price of the token from $0.05 to $0.16. The project is also aiming for fundraising to hit its target of $50 million. This approach was designed to ensure that the growth of the token is structured, helping it sustain its growth. Allocation Percentage (%) Purpose Presale 45% Community-driven token launch Marketing 25% Promotion, Partnerships, Outreach Development 10% Project Growth, Upgrades, Security Liquidity 10% Exchange Liquidity & Initiatives Ecosystem 5% Community Incentives & Initiatives Giveaways 5% Rewards, Events, Engagement After its launch, $NEOP will unlock hourly, ensuring immediate circulation and avoiding price volatility, a feature that is expected to attract investors. In addition, every transaction is expected to add 2.5% to the liquidity, ensuring that a portion of its LP tokens are burnt to stabilize the price of the token and boost investor assurance. In addition, the token distribution shows that the project is following its purpose, allocating 45% of its supply to the presale, 25% to marketing, 10% to its platform development, another 10% to liquidity, and 5% each to ecosystem development and giveaways. This allocation move will ensure growth and support for its community and the development of its platform. Competitor Coins Run for Cover Allows token holders to make decisions through its governance framework, especially on listings and developments. Sets itself apart from tokens like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) by putting its community first and pushing decentralized governance. Stands out among presales like Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) and Solaxy (SOLX), which lacks tools to carry its community along. Positioned as an asset with high potential due to its development model and direction. Avoids centralization risks faced by platforms like Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) by allowing community contribution. Seamless Token Acquisition Steps Entering the project at this early stage requires a straightforward process: You need to set up a wallet compatible with ERC-20 tokens like MetaMask. You will need to deposit funds in USDT, USDC, or ETH. Connect your wallet using the Neo Pepe presale platform. Swap your choice of crypto for $NEOP Check your transaction details and confirm the transaction details. Safely store your tokens inside your wallet. Potential No Other Coin Can Replicate Neo Pepe is not just looking to be a participant in the crypto space, it wants to lead it. Using its tokenomics and community governance, Neo Pepe ensures its members are updated with the happenings, making it a market leader in the crypto market. Compared to traditional cryptocurrencies, the project’s presale structure and liquidity features position it at the front of the growing crypto market. Neo Pepe’s approach to unlocking its token and liquidity maintenance is different from the volatility experienced by some presales, providing investors with a stable investment, making it one of the best presales in the current market. Investors looking for the next big opportunity in the crypto market need to start looking into Neo Pepe ($NEOP), not because of its present appeal but for its promise of combining decentralization and investor empowerment. Crypto investors looking for early crypto projects to invest in are looking at Neo Pepe, with most of them confident in its role as a big player in the market in the coming years. With its presale stages defined and its governance model in place, Neo Pepe presents a blend of opportunity, community, and development for investors looking for them, presenting itself as the next digital asset to look forward to in the market.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/cryptos-next-big-success-might-just-be-neo-pepe-neop/,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Press Release",cryptocompare
2025-06-10T07:17:57,"Paraguay President's X account was hacked and promoted BTC scam","Paraguay’s presidency said Monday that Santiago Peña’s verified X account was broken into and used to spread a fake message about adopting Bitcoin. The warning came after a strange post appeared on his profile, claiming the country had made Bitcoin legal tender and was creating a $5 million Bitcoin reserve fund. The message, written in English, had a Spanish-language image attached that falsely appeared to be an official government notice. The government told the public to ignore anything coming from the account until further notice. Officials said they noticed “irregular activity” that showed signs of “unauthorized entry.” That same morning, the cybersecurity team in Paraguay began working with X’s security department to figure out who got in and how. Officials connect hack to wider crypto scam wave in Latin America According to Reuters , the timing of the breach tracks with a growing wave of crypto scams on social media. These types of frauds usually show up in the form of sponsored posts or fake official messages pushing people to invest. The hacker behind Peña’s account followed that same playbook. The story echoes what happened in Argentina earlier this year, when President Javier Milei promoted a token named Libra on his social media that collapsed almost immediately. That scandal blew up in his face and triggered public backlash, especially after critics accused him of helping to pump a worthless coin. El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele actually did make Bitcoin legal in his country back in 2021 and launched tokenized bonds shortly after. But what happened in Paraguay this week wasn’t real policy—it was a digital trap planted by someone exploiting Peña’s account. This isn’t Paraguay’s first brush with hackers. In May, the communications ministry tracked at least 18 attacks on over a dozen public agencies, including the civil aviation regulator and justice ministry. Those hacks targeted email systems, cloud platforms, and login credentials, and no official link to Peña’s breach has been confirmed. As of now, Peña hasn’t made any public statements, and the fake post has been deleted. No arrests or leads have been announced. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-06-10T07:15:37,"Veteran Analyst Brandt Says Ethereum Big Day Is Here","Veteran analyst Peter Brandt suggests that Ethereum may be on the verge of a breakout, saying, ""Every dog has its day."" Ethereum’s price has increased recently, particularly between June 9 and June 10, surging from around $2,400 to over $2,700. This uptick marks a significant rally for the cryptocurrency, continuing its bullish momentum after a brief dip.While Ethereum has experienced considerable volatility in recent months, Peter Brandt, a veteran technical analyst, believes the asset is now setting the stage for a potential breakout.A Potential Breakout in the MakingBrandt highlighted a potential turning point for Ethereum in a post on X. The accompanying chart highlighted how ETH has transitioned from a descending channel to a symmetrical triangle formation. According to Brandt’s analysis, Ethereum has been moving within a descending channel since December 2024, when its price peaked above $4,000. Throughout this period, price movements remained capped within the channel’s boundaries, with resistance at the upper end and support at the lower end. Notably, Ethereum's price tested key levels, including $3,700 in January and $1,390 in April.However, after breaking out of this channel in mid-April, Ethereum's price began to form the symmetrical triangle pattern, which typically signals consolidation before a breakout. In this pattern, Ethereum's price has been capped on both ends. On the downside, support has been tested multiple times, most recently on June 6 at $2,392. Meanwhile, resistance near the $2,700 mark has held firm several times since May.Moving Averages and Market SentimentEthereum’s 18-period moving average is trending upwards, signaling potential short-term bullish momentum. The moving average is currently acting as dynamic support, which may indicate an ongoing upward trend in the market. This aligns with the recent rally and provides further evidence that Ethereum may be gaining strength.On the other hand, the ADX (Average Directional Index) currently sits at 22.72, suggesting that the current trend remains weak. The ADX reading below 25 typically indicates a market consolidating rather than in a strong directional move. If Ethereum's price falls below the $2,150 support level, it could signal a bearish breakdown, potentially leading to further declines toward the long-term support below the $1,390 mark. However, Peter Brandt suggests that Ethereum may be on the verge of a breakout, remarking, ""Every dog has its day — woof woof ETH.” This suggests now could be Ethereum’s time to shine after vastly underperforming Bitcoin.On the upside, resistance is positioned just below the $4,000 mark. Should Ethereum continue its rally, it could surge by approximately 48.7%, moving from its current price of $2,689 to the $4,000 resistance level.Inflows Into Ethereum: A Strong Market SignalMeanwhile, the digital asset market has seen strong inflows, with Ethereum leading the pack. According to CoinShares data , digital asset investment products experienced $224 million in inflows last week, continuing a seven-week streak of positive growth. Notably, Ethereum accounted for the largest share of these inflows, with $296.4 million entering the market. This marks the seventh consecutive week of inflows for Ethereum, pushing the total to $1.5 billion over this period.In contrast, Bitcoin has seen outflows, with $56.5 million leaving the market. This shift in investor sentiment suggests that Ethereum is attracting more attention, further supporting the belief that the cryptocurrency could be positioning itself for a breakout.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/10/veteran-analyst-brandt-says-ethereum-big-day-is-here/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=veteran-analyst-brandt-says-ethereum-big-day-is-here,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Market|Ethereum Price Prediction|Latest Ethereum (ETH) News Today",cryptocompare

In a new report in the San Francisco Chronicle, Tamim Ghulam Haidar, the former Wells Fargo Union City branch operations associate manager, is accused of putting less money into the bank’s ATMs than he reported and pocketing the difference for his own use. Haidar allegedly deposited the ill-gotten gains he is accused of “knowingly and intentionally” embezzling into his own bank accounts or those he controlled and used the funds to cover losses that “he incurred while trading in the foreign currency markets,” according to legal documents filed in the U.S. District Court Northern District of California. Haidar allegedly committed the crimes from February 2021 to October 2022. Prosecutors accuse Haidar of sometimes using other bank employees’ credentials to deposit cash in the ATM to “conceal the fact he was inputting false and inflated dollar amounts.” Haidar is charged with embezzlement by a bank employee and engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity. He faces up to 30 years in federal prison. Prosecutors are also seeking to force Haidar to forfeit the money he allegedly stole.

2025-06-10T06:30:55,"Bitcoin transforms limit size to 4MB","The Bitcoin Core development team announced on Tuesday that the upcoming Core 30 release in October will include a change to the default setting of OP_RETURN. The team said the update will increase the date carrier limit from 80 bytes to nearly 4MB. The team also acknowledged that the decision marks a significant victory for the reformist faction led by Antoine Poinsot in their long-standing debate with conservative figures such as Luke Dashjr. Dashjr’s Bitcoin Knots popularity, which is an alternative implementation of Bitcoin node software, is already surging, as many network operators are concerned about the potential effects of the change. Bitcoin transforms limit size to 4MB Today is really sad day, Bitcoin Core is now fully malicious. There is no longer any filters on Bitcoin Core agains't shitcoins on the chain. If you still run Core I very strongly urge you to switch to @BitcoinKnots or to not update Core. Bitcoin is our only chance to escape… pic.twitter.com/SGgWZPIcgk — Satoshi Vault 21 (@satoshivault21) June 9, 2025 Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, is set to undergo a major transformation to the design of its most mainstream implementation. The Bitcoin Core team has gotten rid of the 80-byte limit size of OP_RETURN, an element of BTC transactions, to nearly 4MB. Starting from the Core 30 release in October, the first blockchain will mine transactions with bigger outputs and allow any number of these outputs. Greg Sanders, core developer of Blockstream Bitcoin-centric studio, announced the update on his GitHub page. The author argued that the OP_RETURN size limit was designed to protect the network, but it is now failing its mission. “The change re-affirms that Bitcoin is governed by transparent, minimal rules rather than editorial preference. By retiring a deterrent that no longer deters, Bitcoin Core keeps the policy surface lean and lets the fee market arbitrage competing demands.” -Greg Sanders, Software Engineer at Blockstream. Sanders also revealed that blocks remain limited to 4 million weighted units, dust outputs are rejected, and signature-operation and ancestor/descendant caps guard mempool growth. He acknowledged that the withdrawal of the 80-byte rule yields at least two tangible benefits, including a cleaner UTXO set and consistent default behavior. According to Samson Mow, the former Blockstream CSO and current CEO of JAN3, many users find the update to be an undesirable change for a number of reasons. He acknowledged in May that users can refuse to upgrade and stay on 29.0 or run another implementation like Bitcoin Knots. OP_RETURN limit size indicates how much data can be embedded into a cryptocurrency transaction. The limit is regular for standard ones, like payment transfers, though the existing limit censors more data-heavy use cases. Bitcoin is set to process more data with the new upgrade, opening new opportunities for BTC DeFi and NFTs. The debate about the OP_RETURN size limit stems from 11 years ago. Sanders noted that the long-standing cap, originally a gentle signal that block space should be used sparingly for non-payment proof of publication data, had outlived its utility. Sanders deems the current 80-byte ceiling counter-productive Sander acknowledged that consensus rules decide whether a transaction can ever be included in a block. According to him, standardness rules implemented in Bitcoin Core’s relay code decide whether it is forwarded across the peer-to-peer network before it reaches a miner. The tech enthusiast said standardness offers denial-of-service defense, where nodes decline transactions that waste CPU, RAM, or bandwidth disproportionate to their fee. Policies also offer incentive alignment, which gives policy nudges towards wallet authors for free-efficient yet UTXO-friendly constructions. Standardness also offers upgrade safety, where unknown opcodes or version bits remain non-standard until activated by a soft fork. According to Sanders, it prevents premature use that could hamper future consensus changes. The software engineer said the standardized OP_RETURN outputs embody that philosophy. He noted that users already embed arbitrary data in spendable outputs, leaving toxic, unspendable entries in the UTXO set. Sanders also acknowledged that OP_RETURN gave users an unspendable output not added to the UTXO set; the 80-byte ceiling accompanied it as a soft deterrent, which was large enough for a hash or short commitment. According to Sanders, the modern transaction landscape has rendered the legacy cap ineffective and, in several ways, damaging. He noted that several private mining accelerators simply do not enforce the limits, and other centralized services use alternative implementations to peer with these miners as well.

2025-06-10T06:30:49,"Ethereum’s Realized Price Hints at a Market Reset, What Traders Should Know","Ethereum has shown signs of regaining momentum after a recent period of decline. The asset is currently trading at approximately $2,540, reflecting a modest 1% daily increase. This upward move follows a notable dip to the $2,400 range last week, marking what appears to be a short-term rebound from recent bearish pressure. While price fluctuations continue, on-chain analysts closely monitor Ethereum’s market structure through various metrics that provide historical context and potential forecasting value. Recent insights from a CryptoQuant analyst have focused on how ETH’s long-term behavior aligns with certain key indicators, which may help define price floors and signal overheated market conditions. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Ethereum Defend Key Moving Averages – Bullish Signal Or Temporary Relief? Assessing Ethereum Price Floors Using On-Chain Data One of CryptoQuant’s analysts, writing under the name CryptoOnchain, shared a breakdown of Ethereum’s potential “price floors” using a composite of on-chain and market metrics. These floors represent statistical thresholds that have historically acted as support zones during market corrections. Among them is the realized price, which measures the average value at which all circulating ETH last moved on-chain. This metric is often used as a sentiment gauge to track when market participants are in profit or loss. Another benchmark, the mean_price_classic, reflects the average daily closing price of ETH since inception and serves as a cumulative market average. It is used in conjunction with the delta_price_classic, a figure derived from the difference between Ethereum’s realized capitalization and its historical average cap, adjusted for supply. According to the analyst, this delta price is frequently cited in Bitcoin analytics to highlight undervalued zones, and its adaptation for Ethereum provides a comparable lens for identifying periods when the market may be at or near a floor. Tracking Market Tops and Potential Resistance Zones In a separate analysis report, CryptoOnchain highlighted tools for identifying potential market tops. The indicators outlined include the realized_price_x2 and realized_price_x3, which are calculated by multiplying Ethereum’s realized price by two and three, respectively. Historically, these levels have coincided with overheated phases of the market, where prices reached temporary peaks before correcting. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Below $2,800 – Bulls Need This Level To Trigger Next Leg Up Another tool, the price_top_stddev, incorporates volatility into the analysis by adding two times the historical standard deviation of ETH’s closing price to the realized price. This combination serves as a marker of statistically elevated prices, often aligning with periods of heightened euphoria and speculative activity. CryptoOnchain suggests that monitoring these zones can assist traders in managing risk during extended rallies, as these resistance levels have previously preceded major cycle reversals.

2025-06-10T06:25:51,"Missed BTC? MUTM could deliver the biggest gains in 2025","Bitcoin (BTC) recently experienced some of the biggest gains in May 2025. However, the crypto market moves fast, and the rally was over before most could react to it. If you missed the Bitcoin (BTC) rally, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) rally offers you the opportunity for massive gains. Momentum for the DeFi project is building up, with analysts forecasting gains of up to 1,675%. Explosive growth with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Back in 2013, Bitcoin (BTC) was worth around $1,000. Today, those who bought their BTC at $1,000 have seen their gains grow over 100x. However, the era of such massive gains for Bitcoin (BTC) is over. Despite this, there is still an opportunity to make such massive gains in the rest of the market when you choose a project like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that is still on the ground floor. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) does not plan to be just another successful DeFi project; it is built to be the most successful project in DeFi. The team behind it has created a framework that will ensure its long-term growth and success. MUTM tokens are currently in the presale phase, where each token is valued at $0.03. If the price rises to $3, that is easily a 100x increase. For instance, if you invested $2,700 in the presale, that would increase to $270,000. In any other industry, that would be nearly impossible. However, the crypto sector has proven numerous times that such gains are possible. The unique design of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed to be an accretive ecosystem, whose value is expected to continue increasing long after the public launch. The project is built around the Mutuum Finance protocol and the native MUTM token. On Mutuum Finance, users can participate as lenders or borrowers. When a lender deposits their assets in an audited smart contract on the protocol, they start to accrue interest. The interest that they earn is based on the pool’s utilization rate. Borrowers, on the other hand, can take loans within the protocol and pay interest on them at a rate determined by the utilization rate. As more borrowers join a pool, the interest rate rises, which encourages borrowers to pay back their loans. It also encourages more lenders to deposit their assets. Over time, this loop leads to the best possible rate, leading to maximum capital utilization rate. MUTM tokens The MUTM tokens are crucial to the long-term success of the protocol, and the team plans to support their long-term growth to boost the profile of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ecosystem. To do this, they will use protocol profits to purchase MUTM tokens on public exchanges, increasing buying pressure on the tokens. These MUTM tokens will then be distributed to stakers on Mutuum Finance (MUTM), encouraging even more stakers to join the protocol. As a result, protocol profits will rise due to increased user participation. Over the long term, this cycle will generate real value for the protocol users and MUTM token holders. Protocol safeguards In Mutuum Finance (MUTM), the goal is to achieve rapid growth, balanced with the need for long-term sustainability. That design philosophy ensures that the protocol does not run out of steam due to the risk of illiquidity and insolvency. One of the most important measures that they have taken is overcollateralization. That simply means that each loan on the protocol is backed by more than the value of its collateral. This design is based on the reality of the crypto market, where the price of an asset can fluctuate wildly in just a few days. When the value of collateral on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) drops below a certain level, a portion of the collateral may be liquidated. A liquidator is incentivized via a liquidation bonus to purchase the debt at a discount. That ensures they make a small profit while helping to stabilize the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has numerous such measures that are designed to respond to real-world market conditions of the crypto industry. Consequently, it maintains a buffer between the assets and liabilities, ensuring the long-term viability of the protocol. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale MUTM tokens are currently available to the masses via the public presale, which is phase 5. Tokens in this phase are going for $0.03, which is a massive 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. However, this has not slowed down the pace of the presale, which has experienced a massive rise in participation rates in the current phase. So far, over 28% of presale tokens set aside for phase 5 have been sold. Over 11,800 buyers have secured their MUTM tokens, buying a total of over $10.3 million worth of tokens. The presale price is set to rise by 16.67% in phase 6 to $0.035. As such, the current phase represents the last opportunity to make a guaranteed ROI of 100% based on the planned listing price of $0.06. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a unique DeFi project that analysts believe could deliver gains of 1,675% or more. This could be your opportunity to make massive gains, especially if you missed the recent Bitcoin (BTC) rally.

This joint statement, which includes important organizations such as DeFi Education Fund, Coin Center, Solana Foundation's policy arm Solana Institute, Digital Chamber, Blockchain Association, Crypto Council for Innovation, Bitcoin Policy Institute and Paradigm, is considered a critical step in the industry. The BRCA aims not to regulate software developers and infrastructure providers that do not store customer assets in the same way traditional financial institutions do, the statement said. The regulation was first introduced by GOP Majority Representative Tom Emmer and later became a bipartisan proposal with the support of Democratic Representative Ritchie Torres. Related News: Bitcoin Bulls Push Toward Record High - $108,000 Breached - Analyst Shares What to Expect Next “It is critical that we do not treat open source developers like traditional financial institutions.

This is a meaningful step toward protecting peer-to-peer technology developers who do not control customer funds. The updated bill takes a balanced approach, building on FinCEN’s 2019 guidance that developers and infrastructure providers should not be regulated as money transmitters when they do not control customer funds.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-10T06:08:03,"SEC Pushes Forward with Innovation Exemption for Crypto","This shift was made thanks to the broader agency overhaul after Gary Gensler’s departure. Meanwhile, Congress is advancing key crypto legislation—the CLARITY Act and GENIUS Act—while debating protections for blockchain developers. In the UK, the Insolvency Service appointed its first crypto intelligence officer to recover hidden digital assets after the recognition of crypto’s role in bankruptcy and crime. SEC Explores Rule Changes The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is exploring a new “innovation exemption” that could pave the way for a much more flexible regulatory environment for on-chain products and services. SEC Chair Paul Atkins, who previously worked as a crypto lobbyist, revealed the initiative during a Monday roundtable that was hosted by the agency’s Crypto Task Force, titled DeFi and the American Spirit. (Source: SEC ) Atkins said he instructed SEC staff to consider a framework that would offer conditional exemption relief, giving qualifying firms temporary relief from certain regulatory requirements. The aim is to accelerate the development and market entry of blockchain-based technologies while the SEC works on potential amendments to its existing regulations. Atkins positioned this move as a step toward fulfilling President Donald Trump’s vision of establishing the US as the global hub for cryptocurrency innovation. He explained that the proposed exemptions will be available to developers and firms that are willing to comply with specific conditions, thereby encouraging compliant innovation in the country. Atkins also shared that many of the SEC’s current rules were not designed to address decentralized financial systems powered by self-executing code, which suggests that regulatory updates are necessary to accommodate these novel approaches. Additionally, Atkins asked staff to assess whether broader amendments to the SEC’s regulatory structure could better support on-chain financial infrastructure. He acknowledged that the foundational assumptions behind most securities regulations do not easily translate to decentralized systems where software may replace traditional actors. This announcement was made amid a shift in tone at the SEC since former Chair Gary Gensler stepped down in January. Under Gensler’s leadership, the agency was frequently criticized for regulating the crypto industry through enforcement actions rather than through transparent rulemaking. In contrast, the current SEC leadership, including acting Chair Mark Uyeda and Chair Atkins, launched a Crypto Task Force with the stated goal of creating a practical and responsive crypto framework. Atkins told the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services on June 3 that the SEC intends to use the “notice and comment” process to refine its approach. He also revealed that the Crypto Task Force is expected to release its first report in the coming months. Blockchain Bills Gain Momentum in Congress Meanwhile, US lawmakers on the House Financial Services Committee are preparing for a crucial markup hearing on Tuesday to consider the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025, which is also known as the CLARITY Act. The goal of the bill is to define a regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency market, and it could undergo amendments to include new protections for blockchain developers. Committee chair French Hill introduced an amendment focused on the treatment of “non-controlling blockchain developers,” and proposed that such individuals or service providers not be classified as money transmitters, thereby exempting them from related registration requirements. This amendment seems to draw from the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, a separate piece of legislation that was introduced in May by Representative Tom Emmer and a bipartisan group of lawmakers. The proposal to integrate the two bills gained support from several crypto advocacy organizations, including the Blockchain Association, which urged lawmakers to unify the legislative efforts to provide clearer guidance for the crypto industry. The markup hearing on Tuesday will serve as a platform for committee members to discuss and vote on amendments to the CLARITY Act, and could potentially pave the way for the bill to be sent to the full House for consideration. Meanwhile, in the Senate, legislators are expected to vote on the GENIUS Act, which seeks to regulate payment stablecoins. Senate Majority Leader John Thune wants to finalize the stablecoin bill within the week. Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal praised the bipartisan progress on stablecoin regulation and believes in the importance of a market structure bill for long-term industry stability. He thinks that while rules for stablecoins are essential, the broader regulatory clarity offered by the CLARITY Act is equally vital. Despite this progress, the path forward for the CLARITY Act is still uncertain. Representative Maxine Waters, ranking member of the committee, expressed strong opposition by criticizing the bill for failing to address alleged corruption linked to President Donald Trump’s connections to the crypto industry. Waters hosted a Minority Day hearing on Friday, arguing that the legislation would only serve to legitimize misconduct rather than prevent it. Nevertheless, there are signs of bipartisan support. Representative Ritchie Torres, a Democrat and co-sponsor of both the CLARITY Act and the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, appears to want to push the legislation forward. UK Insolvency Service Targets Hidden Crypto In the UK, the Insolvency Service took a major step toward tackling the rising involvement of cryptocurrency in bankruptcy and criminal cases by appointing its first crypto intelligence specialist. Andrew Small, a former police investigator with experience in economic crime, will now lead efforts to trace and recover digital assets that have gone unaccounted for in insolvency proceedings. This move comes in response to a staggering 420% increase in crypto-related insolvency cases in the UK over the past five years. The total estimated value of crypto assets in such cases rose from just over £1,400 to more than £523,000. Small’s role will involve using his expertise to identify and track various types of digital assets, from mainstream cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum to meme coins like Dogecoin and even non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The Insolvency Service is responsible for recovering funds to repay creditors in bankruptcy and liquidation scenarios, and said Small’s appointment will improve outcomes by providing investigators with the technical knowledge that is required to navigate the complex crypto landscape. Neil Freebury, head of intelligence at the Insolvency Service, believes that Small’s addition to the team will enhance collaboration and help in cases involving crypto ownership. As digital asset ownership becomes more prevalent, Small said that crypto is now “very much a recoverable asset” in insolvency cases. Andrew Small A recent study by the Financial Conduct Authority revealed that 12% of UK adults owned crypto in 2024, up from just 4% in 2021. The average value held by these individuals was approximately £1,842. In parallel with the Insolvency Service’s ramped-up efforts, UK authorities are also tightening regulations on the crypto industry.

2025-06-10T05:54:02,"Crypto Regulations in Slovenia 2025","The post Crypto Regulations in Slovenia 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Slovenia, a small but highly developed European country with a population of 2.1 million, boasts a rich industrial history that has significantly contributed to its robust economy. As the most economically developed Slavic nation, Slovenia has consistently grown since adopting the Euro in 2007. Its openness to innovation has been a key driver of success in the industrial sector, making it a favored destination for crypto enthusiasts. Many believe Slovenia is poised to become a powerful fintech hub in Europe. But does its current crypto regulatory framework support such aspirations? Let’s explore Slovenia’s crypto regulations and see if they can propel the country to the forefront of the cryptocurrency landscape. My expectation is positive. What’s yours? Before answering, let’s delve deeper. 1. Crypto Regulations in Slovenia: An Overview Slovenia is renowned for its pro-innovation stance, providing a supportive environment for emerging technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Under the Act on Payments Services and Systems, cryptocurrencies are classified as virtual assets rather than financial or monetary instruments. Regulation of the crypto sector in Slovenia is decentralized. Various authorities manage different aspects of the ecosystem. For instance, the Bank of Slovenia and the Securities Market Agency oversee cryptocurrency transactions to ensure compliance with financial laws, including Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Anti-Terrorist Financing regulations. The Slovenian Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Act (ZPPDFT-2) incorporates the EU’s 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5MLD) and aligns with the latest FATF recommendations. All virtual currency service providers must register with the Office of the Republic of Slovenia. 2. Crypto Regulations in Slovenia: What’s New? Several notable developments in Slovenia’s crypto sector occurred this year: July 25, 2024 : Slovenia issued a €30 million sovereign digital on-chain bond, the first of its kind in the EU, with a 3.65% return, maturing on November 25, 2024. July 1, 2024 : NiceHash announced Slovenia’s first Bitcoin -focused conference, NiceHashX, scheduled for November 8–9 in Maribor. Thank you @CoinEdition for sharing and spreading the news! Come and join us at our NiceHashX conference in Maribor Slovenia in November! https://t.co/AM5XNvOVgI — NiceHashX (@NiceHash_X) July 1, 2024 3. Crypto Taxation Framework in Slovenia Explained Slovenia’s crypto taxation framework provides clear guidelines for both individuals and corporations. According to the Financial Administration of Slovenia, the tax treatment depends on the trader’s status and the nature of the transaction. Individuals : Income earned from cryptocurrencies through employment or ongoing business activities is subject to personal income tax. However, capital gains from trading or market fluctuations are exempt from taxation. Corporations : Capital gains from cryptocurrency activities are subject to a corporate income tax of 19%. The Value-Added Tax (VAT) generally applies at a rate of 22%, although cryptocurrency transactions considered means of payment are exempt from VAT. Companies are not allowed to restrict payment methods to cryptocurrencies alone. Tokens issued during ICOs must follow standard accounting rules and the Law on Corporation Tax. 4. Crypto Mining in Slovenia: What You Should Know Crypto mining is unrestricted in Slovenia, but income from mining is considered business income and is therefore taxable. This includes rewards from validating transactions and any additional income from mining operations. Both individuals and legal entities must comply with Slovenian tax regulations. 5. Timeline of the Evolution of Crypto Regulations in Slovenia Here is a timeline highlighting the evolution of crypto regulations in Slovenia: 2023 : The EU adopted the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), establishing a uniform regulatory framework for crypto-assets, their issuers, and service providers across the EU 2017 : The Financial Administration of Slovenia provided more detailed guidelines on cryptocurrency taxation, based on factors such as the trader’s status and the type of transaction. 2013 : The Slovenian Financial Administration issued guidelines stating that income from cryptocurrency transactions should be taxed. Endnote Slovenia’s approach to the crypto sector is commendable, reflecting its optimistic view of the future of cryptocurrencies. The country’s balanced regulatory framework supports crypto innovation while protecting user rights and preventing illegal activities. Recent developments show Slovenia’s commitment to continually improving its regulatory environment. Slovenia’s crypto regulation framework sets a positive example for other nations navigating the evolving crypto landscape. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-10T05:52:22,"SEC chair Paul Atkins proposes “innovation exemption” to spur onchain development","Under the leadership of Paul Atkins, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is looking to fast-track crypto innovation through exemptions and tailored rulemaking. During the fifth meeting of the SEC’s Crypto Task Force roundtable titled DeFi and the American Spirit, Atkins outlined plans for a new “innovation exemption” that would provide conditional relief from certain regulatory requirements. While broader regulatory changes remain under development, the exemptions would provide a temporary structure to support the safe deployment of onchain services. Atkins said the exemptions would be designed to support firms that are willing to meet specified conditions while developing blockchain-based systems. These measures, he noted, would allow for responsible innovation within the boundaries of investor protection and market integrity. He also revealed that SEC staff have been directed to evaluate whether additional guidance or rule changes may be needed to help registrants interact with self-executing software systems in compliance with securities laws. “These on-chain self-executing software systems have proven to be resilient in the face of crises,” he said, contrasting them with centralized platforms that have failed under recent stress. “Many on-chain systems continued to operate as designed pursuant to open-source code.” You might also like: Crypto languished in ‘SEC limbo’ for years: Paul Atkins reaffirms crypto commitments Atkins emphasised that most securities regulations were built around traditional intermediaries such as broker-dealers and exchanges. “The drafters of these rules and regulations likely did not contemplate that self-executing software code might displace such issuers and intermediaries,” he noted, calling for regulatory flexibility to accommodate these new models. Atkins, appointed earlier this year as part of President Trump’s push to establish the U.S. as a global leader in crypto innovation, has called for a “rational regulatory framework” that balances innovation with investor protection. In contrast to his predecessor’s approach , Atkins is steering the SEC toward inclusive policymaking that recognises the operational differences between traditional financial intermediaries and decentralised systems. Since taking office, he has repeatedly stressed the need for structured, participatory rulemaking that reflects the unique characteristics of blockchain systems and crypto assets. The SEC’s Crypto Task Force, led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, is expected to release its first policy report in the coming months. The report will contribute to a regulatory foundation that Atkins says is urgently needed to support the growth of onchain technologies and provide long-awaited clarity for market participants.
