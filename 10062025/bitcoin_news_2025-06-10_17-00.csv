2025-06-10T14:58:08,"Analysts Unite: ""The Big Day Has Come for Ethereum, Explosive Rally Is Imminent!""","The largest altcoin Ethreum (ETH) performed poorly against Bitcoin (BTC) and failed to deliver the long-awaited performance. However, analyst Peter Brandt, who has 50 years of experience, said that now is the time for Ethereum. Arguing that Ethereum may be on the verge of a breakout at this point, Peter Brandt pointed out in the chart he shared that ETH has moved from a descending channel to a symmetrical triangle formation. The symmetrical triangle formation that Brandt highlighted usually signals consolidation before a significant breakout. Brandt, who shares the caption “Every dog has its day – woof woof ETH,” argues that now could be Ethereum's time to shine after falling far behind Bitcoin, which he has been criticizing. However, Brandt has often stated that as a trader he prefers Bitcoin and does not care about Ethereum. Data Points to a Rise in Ethereum! Apart from Peter Brandt, Singapore-based analysis firm QCP Capital also published a positive report for Ethereum. At this point, QCP analysts said that Ethereum bullish momentum is strengthening. Analysts stated that the macro environment is also favorable for the rise of Ethereum, and that they expect the stablecoin law called GENIUS to pass and that this law increases the potential for the rise in Ethereum. “Ethereum is quietly regaining its dominance and its narrative is strengthening. There is an increase in implied volatility. Short-term ATM volatility has entered the 70% range. There is an increase in call options. Perpetual futures funding rates have increased. All of these indicators have strengthened the upward momentum. Additionally, the flow in the Ethereum spot ETF is also positive, indicating increasing interest from institutional investors. Finally, the US stablecoin bill called GENIUS is expected to pass. This further increases the potential upside for Ethereum.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-10T14:47:45,"South Korea's Ruling Party Wants to Allow Companies to Issue Stablecoins: Bloomberg","South Korean President Lee Jae-myung's Democratic Party submitted a bill to parliament that would allow qualifying companies to issue stablecoins , Bloomberg reported on Tuesday. The Digital Asset Basic Act is aimed at improving transparency and encouraging competition in cryptocurrency, Bloomberg said. Companies would be able to issue their own stablecoins provided they have at least 500 million won ($368,000) in equity capital and can guarantee refunds through reserves as well as receiving approval from the Financial Services Commission. Lee, voted in as president last week, made a number of promises to South Korea's crypto industry during his election campaign, appealing to the nation's 15 million crypto investors. Among them, he said the country should support a won-based stablecoin market ""to prevent national wealth from leaking overseas,"" the Korea Herald reported. Stablecoins are tokens pegged to the value of a traditional financial asset, such as a fiat currency, with the U.S. dollar being comfortably the most prevalent. Their stability provides a counterweight to the volatility of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin BTC and ether ETH, allowing users to hold capital in digital assets without having to worry about wild swings in price. The sector, which is dominated by Tether's USDT, has experienced a surge in interest this year thanks to, among other factors, progress toward regulation of the sector in the U.S . The strength of the stablecoin sector has been highlighted in the last week by the strong performance of USDC issuer Circle's stock (CRCL) following its initial public offering (IPO). The shares more than quadrupled during the first three days of trading.

2025-06-10T14:40:22,"Trump Crypto Project’s Massive $52M Shift to Aave V3 for Strategic DeFi Lending","BitcoinWorld Trump Crypto Project’s Massive $52M Shift to Aave V3 for Strategic DeFi Lending In a move that has captured significant attention across the cryptocurrency landscape, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a decentralized finance project reportedly linked to the Trump family, executed a substantial transfer of digital assets. Approximately $52 million worth of crypto was moved to the prominent Aave V3 protocol, signaling a notable engagement with the world of DeFi lending . Aave V3 : The Destination for a Massive Crypto Shift The core of this recent activity centers around Aave V3 , one of the leading decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocols. Aave allows users to participate as depositors or borrowers. Depositors provide liquidity to earn passive income, while borrowers can take out loans in an overcollateralized manner. According to data shared by Onchain Lens on X, citing analytics from Nansen, the large deposit occurred roughly two hours prior to the report. The sheer scale of the transfer, exceeding $50 million, immediately drew eyes due to the project’s stated affiliation. What Assets Were Involved in the Move? The $52 million deposit wasn’t in a single cryptocurrency but comprised a mix of significant digital assets commonly used within the DeFi ecosystem. The specific assets moved to Aave V3 included: 7,900 ETH : Valued at approximately $21 million at the time of the transfer. ETH (Ethereum) is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, the foundational layer for much of the DeFi world, including Aave. 162.69 WBTC : Worth roughly $17.91 million. WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin) is an ERC-20 token that represents Bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows Bitcoin holders to participate in Ethereum-based DeFi protocols like Aave. Each WBTC is backed 1:1 by Bitcoin held in custody. 5,010 stETH : Valued at around $13.31 million. stETH (staked ETH) is a liquid staking token issued by Lido Finance, representing ETH staked on the Ethereum Beacon Chain. Like WBTC , stETH allows users to earn staking rewards while still being able to use their capital in DeFi protocols. The choice of these assets – ETH, WBTC , and stETH – is strategic within the DeFi lending context. They are highly liquid, widely accepted as collateral on platforms like Aave, and represent significant portions of the overall crypto market capitalization. Depositing these assets allows the project to earn yield on them while also unlocking borrowing power. Understanding the DeFi Lending Strategy Behind the Deposit Why would a project move such a large sum to a platform like Aave? The primary motivation for depositing assets into a protocol like Aave V3 is to utilize them as collateral. By depositing ETH, WBTC , and stETH , WLFI gained the ability to borrow other assets without having to sell their underlying holdings. This is a fundamental aspect of DeFi lending . Instead of liquidating assets to raise cash or stablecoins, users can lock their crypto in a smart contract and borrow against its value. This offers several potential advantages: Liquidity without Selling: The project can access funds (like stablecoins) for operational needs or investments without triggering a taxable event or losing exposure to the potential upside of their deposited assets (ETH, WBTC , stETH ). Capital Efficiency: Deposited assets can potentially earn interest while simultaneously being used as collateral to borrow. Leverage: While risky, borrowing allows users to potentially increase their exposure to other assets or strategies. In this specific instance, following the large deposit, WLFI proceeded to take out a 7.5 million USDT loan from Aave V3 . USDT (Tether) is the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, pegged to the US dollar. Borrowing stablecoins is a common practice in DeFi for various purposes. Why Take a USDT Loan and Move to BitGo? The 7.5 million USDT loan taken out from Aave V3 is a direct consequence of the collateral deposited. The loan amount is significantly less than the value of the deposited assets ($7.5M borrowed vs. $52M deposited), indicating a high collateralization ratio, which is standard practice to mitigate liquidation risk. Following the loan, the 7.5 million USDT was reportedly moved to a BitGo wallet. BitGo is a digital asset trust and security company that provides institutional-grade custody, security, and liquidity solutions. Moving funds to a platform like BitGo suggests potential operational use or conversion into traditional fiat currency. The report from Onchain Lens speculates this move to BitGo is ‘possibly in preparation for converting them to USD’. While the exact purpose isn’t confirmed, common reasons for borrowing stablecoins and moving them to an institutional custodian like BitGo include: Funding operational expenses. Preparing for conversion to fiat for traditional investments or expenditures. Moving funds to a regulated custodian for enhanced security or compliance purposes. Facilitating over-the-counter (OTC) transactions. This step highlights the bridge between the decentralized world of DeFi and more traditional financial infrastructure, often utilized by larger players or institutions. The Significance of a Trump Crypto Project in DeFi The involvement of a project explicitly linked to the Trump family in significant DeFi activity like this is noteworthy. While the political implications are outside the scope of cryptocurrency market analysis, the presence of figures or entities from traditional political and financial spheres in the crypto space often attracts increased scrutiny and attention. A ‘ Trump crypto ‘ project making such a large onchain move brings the transparency of decentralized ledgers into the spotlight for a potentially wider audience. It also underscores the growing adoption, albeit sometimes controversial, of decentralized protocols by entities with ties to traditional power structures. This event serves as a real-world example of how entities with significant capital are exploring and utilizing DeFi protocols like Aave V3 for financial strategies, whether it’s earning yield on assets, borrowing against collateral, or seeking liquidity. What Does This Mean for the Average User? While a $52 million move might seem distant from the average crypto holder’s activity, this event illustrates core concepts relevant to anyone interested in decentralized finance: Onchain Transparency: This transaction was tracked and reported precisely because blockchain transactions are public. Anyone with the right tools can see these movements, offering a level of transparency often lacking in traditional finance. DeFi Utility: Platforms like Aave V3 provide powerful tools for managing digital assets – earning yield, borrowing, and managing risk – accessible to anyone, not just large entities. Asset Choice: The focus on ETH, WBTC , and stETH highlights their importance as foundational assets within the DeFi ecosystem. Risk Management: While not detailed in the source, using DeFi lending comes with risks, primarily liquidation risk if the value of deposited collateral falls significantly. Understanding loan-to-value ratios and potential liquidation points is crucial. Risks Associated with DeFi Lending It’s crucial to remember that while platforms like Aave V3 offer powerful financial tools, they are not without risks. For any participant, including large projects, key risks include: Liquidation Risk: If the value of the deposited collateral (ETH, WBTC , stETH ) drops relative to the borrowed asset (USDT), and the loan-to-value ratio exceeds a certain threshold, the collateral can be automatically liquidated by the protocol to repay the loan. Market volatility is a constant factor. Smart Contract Risk: DeFi protocols rely on complex code (smart contracts). While Aave is a mature and audited protocol, there is always a theoretical risk of bugs or exploits, although this risk is considered lower for established platforms. Market Risk: The value of deposited assets can fluctuate wildly, impacting the health of the loan position. Stablecoin Risk: While USDT is designed to be stable, there are always underlying risks associated with stablecoin issuers and their reserves, though USDT has maintained its peg effectively for long periods. Entities engaging in DeFi lending must actively manage these risks, often through monitoring collateralization ratios and potentially adding more collateral or repaying part of the loan if market conditions deteriorate. Conclusion: A Significant Onchain Event The movement of $52 million by the Trump-linked WLFI project to Aave V3 and the subsequent $7.5 million USDT loan is a significant onchain event. It demonstrates the continued, albeit sometimes controversial, adoption of decentralized finance protocols by entities outside the traditional crypto native space. The use of ETH, WBTC , and stETH as collateral for a stablecoin loan highlights common strategies employed within DeFi lending . While the ultimate purpose of the borrowed funds moved to BitGo remains speculative, the transparency of the blockchain allows observers to track these large capital flows, offering insights into the financial strategies being pursued by projects with notable affiliations.

However, it has slipped back below $110,000 as buyer fatigue set in, allowing sellers to retake control. Despite the decline during the ongoing session, the flagship cryptocurrency is up nearly 2% in the past 24 hours, trading around $109,275. Tether Announces Plans To Open-Source Its Bitcoin Mining System Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino has announced that Tether will work towards making its Bitcoin Mining Operating System (MOS) open-source. The move aims to enable a new wave of Bitcoin mining companies to enter the mining industry and enhance network security. The Mining Operating System is designed to create a level playing field and reduce reliance on third-party hosted software, allowing smaller players to compete with larger mining operations. MOS is built on a scalable, resilient, and modular peer-to-peer architecture and can accommodate startups ranging from Raspberry Pi configurations to extensive deployment with multiple mainframes that can manage hundreds of miners. The MOS will also include plugins for various mining machines, containers, and electrical equipment, allowing developers to create custom plugins for specific devices. Paraguay President's X Account Compromised, Claims Bitcoin As Legal Tender Paraguay’s government announced that President Santiago Pena’s X account may have been hacked after a post falsely declaring Bitcoin as legal tender was posted on it. The post, which was written in English and was accompanied by a Spanish translation, stated that Paraguay was launching a Bitcoin-backed reserve fund and integrating the asset into its national financial system. The message also appeared to use an official government decree, using the national coat of arms and official-looking formatting. The post drew skepticism due to its promotional tone, inconsistencies, and absence of communication from official government channels. There was also no confirmation on government websites and state-run media. Wu Blockchain highlighted the suspicious message, adding that all information in it was likely false. “The social media account of Paraguayan President Santiago Peña appears to have been compromised, with a post claiming that Bitcoin has been declared legal tender in Paraguay and that a $5 million BTC reserve has been established as part of the national treasury. However, on-chain data shows the wallet address included in the post holds only $4 and has recorded no transactions since the announcement, suggesting the information is likely false.” Paraguayan government officials issued a statement saying the President’s X account was exhibiting irregular activity, suggesting unauthorized access. The statement urged citizens to disregard the post and await official communication. “The president’s official X account has presented irregular activity. which suggests possible unauthorized entry.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) surged past $110,000 on Monday, marking the flagship cryptocurrency’s strongest performance since June. The move also saw Bitcoin recoup its losses after a dip that saw the price test the $100,000 support. BTC sits just below its all-time high, with its latest rally driven by several factors. According to Coinglass data, over $200 million in positions were liquidated thanks to BTC’s rally, out of which $195 million were short positions, indicating the strength of the rally. Derivatives volumes also doubled, rising over 110% to $110.63 billion. Open interest also registered a substantial increase, rising over 7% to $76.6 billion. A key external driver of the rally was the easing of trade tensions between the US and China. Negotiations resumed in London, with markets hopeful of a deal that could reduce tariffs and ease export restrictions. However, key drivers remain on-chain, with CryptoQuant contributors highlighting that Bitcoin reserves on centralized exchanges have dropped from 1.55 million in July 2024 to just 1.1 million in June 2025, a decline of 550,000 BTC in under a year. Such declines indicate long-term holding patterns as investors move their assets offline for storage. As more BTC leaves centralized exchanges, the supply shrinks, pushing prices higher. While many expect a substantial rally, more conservative estimates predict a correction before a push higher, expecting CPI data to trigger more volatility in the market. The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers are due for Tuesday, with markets fearing Trump’s tariffs could add pressure on an already volatile market. Analysts have predicted the CPI to rise 0.3% month-over-month and 2.3% year-over-year. Meanwhile, Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, is expected to rise 0.3% month-over-month and 2.9% year-over-year. A jump in inflation could reduce the possibility of a Fed rate cut. BTC traded in positive territory the previous weekend, rising 0.69% on Saturday and almost 1% on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,779. The price fell to an intraday low of $103,768 on Monday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $105,902. BTC lost momentum on Tuesday, falling 0.44% to $105,436. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price dropped almost 1%, slipping below $105,000 and settling at $104,752. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC plunged 3%, falling to a low of $100,424 before settling at $101,614. Source: TradingView Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered on Friday, rising nearly 3% and moving to $104,378. Price action remained positive over the weekend as BTC rose 1.15% on Saturday and 0.20% on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,784. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as BTC surged over 4%, surging past the 20-day SMA and $110,000 to settle at $110,251. The current session sees the price down over 1%, trading around $109,098. With buyers losing momentum, BTC could continue declining and settle around $105,000.

What’s the Latest on Trump Tariffs and the DoJ? According to reports, the Department of Justice (DoJ) has formally requested an appeals court to extend the temporary pause, known as a ‘stay,’ on a ruling that invalidated some of President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs. Think of a stay as hitting the pause button on a court order while a higher court reviews the case. This situation stems from a ruling by the U.S. Court of International Trade back on May 28th. That court decided to stop the enforcement of a specific reciprocal tariff policy. Essentially, the court found issues with how these particular Trump tariffs were applied or justified. Following that ruling, the Federal Circuit Court stepped in and temporarily delayed the enforcement of the invalidation – that’s the stay the DoJ now wants extended. Why is the Department of Justice Requesting an Extension? The core argument presented by the Department of Justice (DoJ) is that the ruling invalidating the tariffs could potentially ‘infringe on the president’s foreign policy authority.’ This gets into a fundamental aspect of U.S. governance: the separation of powers. Here’s a simplified breakdown of the DoJ’s perspective: Executive Power: The executive branch, led by the President, traditionally holds significant authority over foreign policy and negotiating international agreements, including trade terms. Tariffs as Tools: Tariffs, while economic tools, are often used as leverage or a response in international relations and trade policy negotiations. Judicial Review: While courts review the legality of government actions, the DoJ argues that in this specific instance, the court’s ruling on the tariffs overstepped by interfering with the President’s constitutionally vested foreign policy role. By seeking an extension of the stay, the DoJ is buying time for the appeals process to unfold, hoping the higher court will ultimately side with their view that the original ruling improperly constrained executive authority in setting US tariffs as part of foreign policy. Understanding the Background: What Were These Reciprocal Trump Tariffs? During his presidency, Donald Trump implemented various tariffs under different legal authorities. The specific reciprocal tariffs challenged here were part of his administration’s broader strategy to address perceived trade imbalances and unfair practices by other nations. The idea behind ‘reciprocal’ tariffs often involved imposing duties on goods from countries that imposed similar duties on U.S. goods, or using them as leverage to achieve more favorable trade terms. These policies were controversial and faced criticism for potentially increasing costs for consumers and businesses, disrupting supply chains, and provoking retaliatory tariffs from other countries, impacting international trade flows significantly. The Legal Path: Court of International Trade to Federal Circuit Let’s trace the legal journey of this case: Initial Challenge: Businesses or entities affected by the specific reciprocal tariffs filed a lawsuit, likely arguing the tariffs were improperly imposed or exceeded the President’s legal authority under the statutes used. U.S. Court of International Trade Ruling: This specialized court handles cases involving international trade and customs law. It heard the arguments and ruled against the government, finding the tariffs in question to be invalid or improperly applied. This was a win for those challenging the Trump tariffs . Appeal to the Federal Circuit: The government (represented by the DoJ) appealed this ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. This court handles appeals from specialized courts like the Court of International Trade. Request for Stay: As part of the appeal process, the government asked the Federal Circuit to issue a stay, pausing the effect of the lower court’s ruling while the appeal is considered. The Federal Circuit granted a temporary stay. DoJ’s Current Request: The DoJ is now asking the Federal Circuit to extend that temporary stay, indicating the appeal process is ongoing and they need more time for the higher court to make a final decision without the original ruling immediately taking effect. This legal back-and-forth highlights the checks and balances in the U.S. system, where judicial review can challenge executive actions, particularly those impacting commerce and international trade . What are the Potential Implications of This Legal Battle? The outcome of this appeal could have several important consequences: For Businesses: If the original ruling invalidating the tariffs is upheld, companies that paid these specific US tariffs might be eligible for refunds. If the DoJ wins the appeal, the tariffs could remain in place or the government’s authority to impose similar tariffs in the future could be affirmed. This creates uncertainty for importers and exporters. For Consumers: Tariffs are often costs passed on to consumers. Removing tariffs can potentially lead to lower prices on imported goods, while keeping them in place can maintain or increase costs. For Executive Authority: A key aspect is the extent of the President’s power to use tariffs as a tool of foreign policy without detailed congressional approval or facing judicial invalidation. The ruling could set a precedent for future trade policy decisions. For International Relations: The presence or absence of these tariffs impacts trade relationships with affected countries. The legal challenge itself sends signals about the stability and predictability of U.S. trade policy . While the direct link to cryptocurrency markets is tangential, major shifts in global trade dynamics, legal challenges to executive power, and significant sums of money potentially changing hands (via refunds or continued tariff collection) can contribute to the overall economic climate and market sentiment. Uncertainty in traditional markets can sometimes influence flows into alternative assets, though this is a complex relationship. What Happens Next? The Federal Circuit Court will consider the DoJ’s request for an extended stay. They will likely hear arguments from both the government and the plaintiffs who originally challenged the tariffs. The court will then decide whether to extend the stay while they deliberate on the full appeal of the Court of International Trade’s ruling. This process could take time, leaving the status of these specific US tariffs in limbo for a while longer. Conclusion: A Watch on Trade Policy and Power The U.S. Department of Justice ‘s request to extend the stay on the ruling against Trump tariffs is more than just procedural; it’s a critical point in a legal challenge that tests the boundaries of executive authority in setting trade policy and impacts the landscape of international trade . As this case proceeds through the appeals court, businesses, consumers, and observers of government power dynamics will be watching closely. The outcome will help define how future US tariffs can be implemented and challenged, shaping aspects of the U.S. economy and its relationships with trading partners.

In an interview on The Diary of a CEO YouTube channel, Wood says she sees TSLA surging 744% in half a decade, spurred by the firm’s robotaxi platform. According to Wood, Tesla’s fleet of autonomous vehicles will become the centerpiece of the company’s business strategy in the coming years. “Our prediction in five years is $2,600, and 90% of that valuation comes not from the electric vehicle, but from this robotaxi platform. Because the electric car, if you think about it, is a one-shot sale. Sell and hope they come when they’re replacing their car.” During the firm’s Q4 2024 earnings call, CEO Elon Musk explained how Tesla owners can generate income by renting out their full self-driving vehicles instead of just parking them when not in use. “And I expect us to be operating unsupervised activity with our internal fleet in several cities by the end of the year. Then as probably next year when people are able to add or subtract their car from the fleet. So, kind of like Airbnb, where you can sort of add or subtract your house or your guestroom, add it to the Airbnb or don’t add it to the Airbnb inventory. If you’re traveling for a month, you can or whatever the case may be, you can let other people use your house.” For now, Wood says that Tesla has two options to generate recurring revenue for both the company and the vehicle owner. “You could subscribe to the network. It could be either or: subscription or ala carte if you don’t think you’re going to use it that much.” As of Monday’s close, TSLA is worth $308 per share.

User reports are already surfacing of Alby removing BTC balances in full. There are already user reports that Alby wallet, a convenience app for storing BTC using the Lightning network, has emptied out wallets due to its inactivity clause. Wallets with no transactions in 12 months are subject to an inactivity fee, with the right to move the entire balance. Even the founder of the SlowMist investigation team was affected. Yu Xian (@evilcos) reported that his Alby balance was removed, losing a relatively small remaining amount of BTC. Despite this, the centralized ability to move funds has worried the crypto community. 很好，这次我也是受害者了…被 @getAlby 偷走 0.00174788 BTC($191.96)。能偷是因为这是 Alby 的托管账号。我是很震惊的，因为这鬼协议我必然是不知情的… 我猜是不是会给我发邮件通知，果然 2025/5/1 给我发了个： Updates to our Terms of Service – Please Review… https://t.co/Snc7EjKmPb pic.twitter.com/7LjLaai5Ur — Cos(余弦)😶‍🌫️ (@evilcos) June 10, 2025 Most self-custodial wallets have no inactivity clause. Alby, however, changed its terms of service in March, adding a section on inactivity fees. Alby wallet is registered as a trader based on the European Union definition, and is compliant with EU law. The first reports of Alby moving funds without approval came from a WeChat group, as the wallet is one of the staple apps of Asian traders and holders. Outside the issue with legacy wallets, Alby continues to onboard more users with highly active social media marketing. The app will also move to a new data center, as recently announced, briefly pausing some of its services. Alby claimed user funds are still recoverable when they reached out to support. Alby wallet’s updated ToS allows it to empty inactive legacy wallets Alby is also different from other wallets in that it has a subscription fee for some of its paid services. Alby also tries to manage both new and legacy wallets, with the recent confiscation rule affecting wallets created before 2023. “ To manage these inactive accounts effectively, we reserve the right to deduct the entire remaining balance from a user’s legacy Alby Account with a shared wallet after 12 consecutive months of inactivity, defined as no completed transactions during that period,” explained Alby in its ToS . The wallet operator has also opened a helpline for affected wallets. Alby has the ability to retain balances, as it offers a switch between Lightning network and the Bitcoin main chain. Up to 70,000 users may be affected based on the total download count . Michael Bumann, Lightning network and Alby wallet developer, also stated that the legacy wallets were affected only after a long transition period with multiple warnings. However, the recent transfers and inability to withdraw funds worried users whose balances disappeared. Hi, I understand your frustration.

Alby was able to move the funds, as it initially launched custodial wallets where it controlled the keys. New wallets leave the holder in control of the private keys and hold no similar vulnerability. Alby offers a model based on wallet-as-a-service, with a $9.90 monthly subscription. The wallet offers cloud hosting, but can also be self-hosted. The ability to hold BTC for a long time is key for most wallet owners, so Alby’s move goes against the main crypto ethos of holding BTC in a self-custody wallet.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) rose above the important resistance level at $110,000 for the first time in days. Other top-performing altcoins were Axelar ( AXL ), AAVE ( AAVE ), Uniswap ( UNI ), and Pepe ( PEPE ). Axelar’s price jumped to a high of $0.6317, its highest point since January and 110% above its lowest level this year. Similarly, AAVE surged to $315, up 178% from its April low, while Uniswap and Pepe gained more than 10%. Bitcoin price to break 8-year resistance The primary catalyst behind the market’s rally is Bitcoin’s breakout above $110,000 on Monday, increasing the odds of a retest of the all-time high at $111,900. A look at the long-term chart shows Bitcoin hovering just below the ascending trendline that connects major swing highs since December 2017. It retested that trendline twice in 2021, again in March last year, and once more in May this year.

US and China trade talks and FOMC minutes Bitcoin and other crypto prices jumped as traders waited for the outcome of the US and China trade talks . Market participants are hopeful the two sides will reach an agreement on semiconductor and rare earth trade and tariffs. A resolution would likely ease tensions and support gains in both crypto and equities markets. Additionally, the Federal Reserve will release minutes from its most recent meeting on Wednesday. These minutes may offer insight into the Fed’s thinking and policy direction for the remainder of the year. Any signs pointing to potential interest rate cuts would likely boost crypto prices further. Separately, Axelar surged following its listing on Upbit, the largest crypto exchange in South Korea. Historically, such listings tend to result in significant, though often short-lived, price spikes. AAVE token jumped as the total value locked in its network neared the key point at $27 billion .

2025-06-10T14:10:33,"SAP AI: Revolutionizing Enterprise Efficiency with Suite AI","BitcoinWorld SAP AI: Revolutionizing Enterprise Efficiency with Suite AI In the fast-evolving world of technology, the adoption of artificial intelligence is no longer a futuristic concept but a present-day imperative for businesses looking to stay competitive. For those navigating the complexities of the digital landscape, including the dynamic realm of cryptocurrency and blockchain, understanding how core enterprise systems are leveraging AI is crucial. This is where SAP AI comes into play, specifically through its comprehensive offering, SAP Suite AI . SAP, a global leader in enterprise software, is making significant strides in embedding AI capabilities directly into the tools businesses use every day, promising a future of enhanced productivity and smarter operations. Discover how these advancements can impact your business by exploring insights from industry experts. Understanding SAP AI and SAP Suite AI What exactly is SAP AI , and how does SAP Suite AI fit into the picture? At its core, SAP AI refers to SAP’s strategic initiative to infuse artificial intelligence across its vast portfolio of business applications. This isn’t just about adding a few AI features; it’s about fundamentally transforming how enterprise software functions. SAP Suite AI is the manifestation of this strategy within SAP’s core business suite, which includes critical areas like ERP, CRM, supply chain management, and HR. The goal is to make these complex systems more intuitive, automated, and intelligent. Instead of users having to manually perform repetitive tasks or dig through mountains of data for insights, AI is designed to proactively assist, automate, and provide actionable intelligence. Think of it as giving the SAP suite a brain that learns and adapts to improve business processes automatically. Why Enterprise AI is Essential for Modern Business The push towards Enterprise AI is driven by a clear need for businesses to operate more effectively in an increasingly competitive global market. Integrating AI into enterprise-level systems provides several key advantages: Increased Automation: AI can automate mundane, repetitive tasks across various departments, freeing up human workers for more strategic activities. Enhanced Decision Making: By analyzing vast datasets quickly and identifying patterns, AI provides deeper insights that inform better, data-driven decisions. Improved Efficiency: Streamlining processes, optimizing resource allocation, and predicting potential issues all contribute to significant gains in operational efficiency. Personalized Experiences: AI can help tailor customer interactions, employee experiences, and even supplier relationships based on individual needs and behaviors. Predictive Capabilities: AI models can forecast trends, predict demand, anticipate equipment failures, and identify potential risks before they occur. For businesses operating in or interacting with the fast-paced cryptocurrency sector, where market dynamics are volatile and operational efficiency can be a significant differentiator, leveraging Enterprise AI through platforms like SAP Suite AI can provide a critical edge. How SAP Suite AI Drives Business Efficiency SAP Suite AI is specifically designed to bring these benefits to the core functions of an enterprise. Here are some ways it helps drive business efficiency : Automated Invoice Processing: AI can read, validate, and process invoices automatically, matching them with purchase orders and flagging discrepancies, significantly reducing manual effort and errors in finance departments. Optimized Supply Chains: AI algorithms can predict demand fluctuations, optimize inventory levels, route logistics more efficiently, and identify potential disruptions in the supply chain before they impact operations. Intelligent Customer Service: AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants can handle routine customer inquiries, freeing up human agents for complex issues, while AI analysis of customer data can personalize interactions and predict customer needs. Predictive Maintenance: In asset management, AI can analyze sensor data from machinery to predict when maintenance is required, preventing costly breakdowns and extending asset lifespan. Enhanced Talent Management: AI can assist in recruiting by screening resumes, identifying best-fit candidates, and even predicting employee flight risk, improving HR efficiency. These are just a few examples. By embedding AI into workflows across the entire business suite, SAP aims to make every process smarter and more efficient. Achieving Seamless AI Integration with SAP One of the major hurdles for businesses adopting AI is successful AI Integration into existing systems and workflows. SAP addresses this challenge by building AI directly into its Suite products, often as pre-configured capabilities or easily activated features. This reduces the complexity typically associated with implementing standalone AI solutions. SAP also provides tools and platforms, such as SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP), that allow customers and partners to build custom AI applications or extend existing SAP functionalities with AI. This flexibility ensures that businesses can tailor their AI Integration strategy to their specific needs and industry requirements. Key considerations for successful integration include: Data Readiness: Ensuring clean, accessible, and well-governed data is fundamental, as AI models rely heavily on quality data. Change Management: Preparing employees for new AI-powered workflows and providing adequate training is crucial for adoption. Ethical AI and Governance: Establishing guidelines for responsible AI use, ensuring fairness, transparency, and data privacy compliance. Phased Rollout: Starting with pilot projects in specific areas to demonstrate value before scaling AI integration across the entire organization.

2025-06-10T14:07:43,"How we went from Bitcoin whitepaper to “paper” Bitcoin","Mortgage-backed securities massively contributed to the 2008 financial crisis. According to some observers, Bitcoin, created as a response to this crisis, started to resemble MBS as a large part of the Bitcoin market is now represented by “paper” Bitcoin or sophisticated Bitcoin derivatives. How accurate is that? Should we get ready for another fundamental shakeout? Table of Contents Crisis of 2008 From Bitcoin whitepaper to “paper” Bitcoin Crisis of 2008 The 2008 financial crisis was a product of several simultaneous misfortunes and disproportions. One of the factors that made it possible was the development of extremely complex trading instruments. Securitization is the term that describes the contractual debt-based pools of money related to these debts (mortgage, auto loans, etc) sold to third parties in the form of securities. Mortgage-backed securities saw sharp traction, but they turned out to be not collateralized properly. Mortgages were given to people with little to no proof of financial solvency. MBS associated with subprime mortgages became the dynamite for the world economy during the housing bubble boom in 2007–2009. Banks, hedge funds, and mortgage lenders saw bankruptcies, liquidations, bank runs, etc. The results of the 2008 financial crisis included a high unemployment rate, crashed markets, an inflation spike, a decline in household wealth, and the number of bailouts. The governments saved the banking system while most of those responsible for the crisis were not punished . An unknown innovator came up with an alternative electronic cash system, not controlled by the banks and governments, known as Bitcoin. Read more: What is a genesis block? From Bitcoin whitepaper to “paper” Bitcoin While Bitcoin is technically independent from any entity as its network is decentralized, governments and corporations eventually found a way to influence Bitcoin to some extent, as they have the power to funnel millions of dollars into Bitcoin. As public awareness about Bitcoin grew, its price went higher. Investments from institutions and governments were mostly seen positively as they were to increase Bitcoin’s spot price and bring it closer to mass adoption. Soon, Bitcoin started to adopt traditional financial instruments to allow profit from bitcoins you don’t hold. In 2017, Bitcoin futures became available. Bitcoin margin trading was already in place by that time. 2024 saw Bitcoin ETF approval. The introduction and growing adoption of Bitcoin derivatives created patterns that remind some of the MBS movements before the 2008 financial crisis outbreak. These days, certain pension funds in the U.S., UK, and Australia invest in Bitcoin through ETFs, just as 17 years ago they were investing in MBS. Just like 17 years ago, Bitcoin derivatives are so sophisticated that risk management is limited. The same was the case with MBS when no one knew exactly who owned what, as the securities were bundled with other instruments and sort of blended. Today fear of missing out fuels institutional investors the similar way it was in 2008. Academic researchers Rahool Kapoor and Natalya Vinokurova released a piece this March, in which they warned readers of inaccurate analogies. They write that comparing Bitcoin to gold is as risky as comparing MBS to bonds. Bitcoin is similar to gold in many ways, whether it is scarcity or high returns, but authors say that Bitcoin may fail the way MBS did after ungrounded trust in this asset mixed with FOMO. These researchers don’t try to explain why many believe that Bitcoin is not only similar to gold but superior in many instances. Nevertheless, their criticism of the processes surrounding Bitcoin these days resembles some (rare) opinions across Crypto Twitter, signaling that too much paper Bitcoin on the market may end up badly. Paper Bitcoin means that when two people use an exchange so that one will lend their bitcoins to another, the real exchange between the two may not happen. Instead, an exchange will display both persons as having these bitcoins. It distorts the data and engages people in trading uncollateralized assets. It's simple. Short sellers of $IBIT , for example, are creating paper Bitcoin. This happens through Operational Short Selling — where market makers borrow ETF shares and short them, while the fund itself holds real BTC. The result? More claims on Bitcoin than actual coins. https://t.co/G4pxLnFVRV — Josh Man (@JoshMandell6) June 8, 2025 Some believe that paper Bitcoin trading is the reason why the BTC price is still far from being one million or even half of it despite multi-million purchases by Bitcoin treasuries. However, it’s worth saying that Bitcoin treasuries use OTC desks to avoid immediate impact on the markets. My thesis is that if the financial system heals then bitcoin treasury companies will probably collapse. If it doesn't heal the banks and the treasury market are close to collapse — DarkSideOfTheMoon (@DarkSide2030_) June 9, 2025 Some in the crypto community oppose Bitcoin treasures for various reasons, including centralization, paper asset trading, lack of usability, insecurity, etc. The narrative surrounding Bitcoin has shifted from the Wall Street denial to a basis for another unsafe asset traded by it. Time will show how sustainable Bitcoin will be in the event that its derivatives fall apart. As of June 2025, only a few experts express concern about paper Bitcoin trading. Some think that obligatory proof-of-reserves would have lowered the risks associated with paper Bitcoin. However, it requires changing the practice of how exchanges act. Others stick to Bitcoin self-custody and don’t trust their funds to Bitcoin treasury companies and other centralized entities.

2025-06-10T14:06:21,"Pundit Says XRP Is the Coin That Comes Closest to Satoshi Nakamoto’s Main Idea","A media figure recently made a bold claim linking XRP to the core vision of Bitcoin's anonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. The statement sparked speculation and admiration among XRP proponents, who believe XRP is ""the real"" Bitcoin.XRP as Satoshi Nakamoto’s Main IdeaIn a post on X, media personality John Squire claimed that XRP comes closest to embodying Satoshi Nakamoto’s original vision.The statement suggests that the XRP token possesses the scalability, decentralization, and use-case orientation that may reflect what Satoshi intended.Notably, Bitcoin emerged as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. However, some XRP supporters argue that high fees, slow transaction speeds, and mining centralization have diluted Bitcoin's original goals. They believe XRP came to address these issues. Proponents often bolster this argument by pointing out that some of XRP's original architects were also involved in Bitcoin’s early development.Further Theory Linking XRP to SatoshiJoining the conversation, XRP community commentator Alex Cobb theorized that Satoshi may have played a role in XRP’s early creation. He referenced a famous quote attributed to Nakamoto from April 2011, which stated that Satoshi had ""moved on"" to other things.https://twitter.com/Cobb_XRPL/status/1932205790519013580Interestingly, just over a year later, XRP launched in June 2012, and some believe this hints at a potential connection. Though speculative, this theory isn’t new within the XRP community. Many argue that XRP’s design improvements better reflect the practical implementation of decentralized finance than Bitcoin currently does.In a previous commentary, Squire extended this narrative by comparing XRP to Starlink , emphasizing its speed and utility. In his analogy, Bitcoin is like a landline—reliable but slow—while Ethereum is a cell phone—more capable but still limited. Meanwhile, Squire claims XRP is the Starlink of crypto: fast, modern, and with minimal lag.This metaphor highlights XRP's ability to process transactions in 3–5 seconds with fees under $0.01, outperforming Bitcoin’s 10-minute blocks and Ethereum’s often congested network.XRP’s Thin Connection to BitcoinInterestingly, speculation has run wild in the XRP community about the project’s potential link to Satoshi Nakamoto. A commentary from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse added fuel to the fire.During a podcast, Garlinghouse noted that some XRP Ledger developers, including Ripple’s CTO David Schwartz, were also early Bitcoin engineers who aimed to improve scalability and reduce energy consumption.This statement led to theories highlighting Schwartz’s involvement in XRP’s development that began shortly after Nakamoto’s last known activity. Additionally, Schwartz once shared a pre-released version of Bitcoin's code around his birthday, which coincides with Satoshi’s.Schwartz himself has joked that he is more likely to be Nakamoto than Craig Wright , who previously claimed the identity but was dismissed by a court. However, the Ripple CTO was only presenting an analogy. While no confirmed identity exists, the XRP community continues to speculate.https://twitter.com/JoelKatz/status/1780100946414195132Meanwhile, the broader crypto community remains skeptical of any direct connection between Satoshi and XRP. Yet for XRP supporters, it’s another reason to believe they hold an asset that builds upon Satoshi’s vision.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/10/pundit-says-xrp-is-the-coin-that-comes-closest-to-satoshi-nakamotos-main-idea/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pundit-says-xrp-is-the-coin-that-comes-closest-to-satoshi-nakamotos-main-idea,"BTC|ETH|MARKET|MINING|XRP","Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today",cryptocompare

2025-06-10T13:47:34,"Charles Hoskinson Unveils ‘Cardinal’: Cardano’s First Trustless Bitcoin DeFi Protocol","Charles Hoskinson, founder of the Cardano blockchain, has officially introduced Cardinal, a new protocol designed to bring Bitcoin into decentralized finance (DeFi) through a trustless, cross-chain solution. A New Model for Bitcoin DeFi Integration Announced via X, the initiative positions Cardano as a serious contender in integrating Bitcoin liquidity with advanced DeFi infrastructure, offering a fundamentally different approach to the wrapped Bitcoin models currently dominating the market. At the core of Cardinal is a system that enables users to wrap Bitcoin’s unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) and convert them into yield-generating DeFi assets. This mechanism allows Bitcoin holders to lend, stake, and borrow within Cardano’s ecosystem without involving custodians or federations, a significant departure from existing models that typically rely on centralized intermediaries. How the Cardinal Protocol Works Romain Pellerin, CTO at InputOutput HK, elaborated on the protocol’s framework, highlighting its emphasis on cross-chain interoperability and security. “It’s a fresh approach for Bitcoin,” noted Pellerin in his official X thread quoted by Hoskinson, pointing to the protocol’s non-custodial design and absence of rehypothecation risks. The protocol leverages Cardano’s extended UTXO model, similar to Bitcoin’s, but enhanced with smart contract capabilities, allowing Bitcoin UTXOs to be seamlessly converted into wrapped assets. These wrapped tokens or NFTs remain pegged 1:1 with the underlying Bitcoin, can be transferred on-chain, and are burnable to release the original Bitcoin or Ordinals. Security is enforced through the implementation of MuSig2, an aggregated multi-signature scheme that locks Bitcoin in a trust-minimized manner. Wrapped assets can be redeemed at any time using fraud-proofed peg-out processes, mitigating the risks typically associated with centralized or federated wrapped Bitcoin systems. Cross-Chain and Ordinals Support A defining feature of Cardinal is its ability to interoperate with multiple blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche. Additionally, it powers a trust-minimized Ordinal bridge, enabling Ordinals to participate in DeFi activities such as lending, borrowing, collateralization, and auctions across different chains while retaining provenance. The protocol is also compatible with non-fungible and verifiable off-chain execution use cases via BitVMX. Bitcoin HTLCs combined with Cardano smart contracts support peg-in, peg-out, and ownership transfers, marking a first for cross-chain Ordinal wrapping with publicly verifiable transaction IDs. Future Enhancements and Industry Implications While Cardinal represents a significant technical milestone, Pellerin acknowledged that further development is essential. He proposed integrating zero-knowledge (ZK) technology for solidarity proofs, recursive state proofs, enhanced liquidity provider systems, and expanded wallet integrations to improve accessibility and scalability. The protocol’s launch could reshape how Bitcoin interacts with DeFi ecosystems, offering yield opportunities on Cardano’s DeFi platforms such as MinswapDEX, SundaeSwap, and Fluid Tokens. It also aligns with views expressed by figures like Robert Kiyosaki, who advocate Bitcoin as a form of “people’s money.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-06-10T13:36:14,"Angel Investor Says 10,000 XRP Portfolio Today Can Turn Into $2.5 Million","Angel investor Armando Pantoja has boldly asserted that a portfolio holding just a few thousand XRP tokens could grow to $2.5 million. Pantoja shared this perspective in a recent tweet, emphasizing the significance of holding 10,000 XRP tokens. He compared its potential to owning one whole Bitcoin or acquiring 50 Ethereum tokens.According to him, every financially savvy individual knows the value of holding 10,000 XRP, 1 Bitcoin, or 50 ETH — and simply waiting for the portfolio to grow, potentially reaching as high as $2.5 million. At that point, he recommends diversifying into even more secure investments, such as real estate.Buying 10,000 XRP and Turning It Into $2.5 MillionNotably, acquiring 10,000 XRP today would require an investment of $22,300, based on the current token price of $2.23. As of now, data from the XRP Rich List shows that only 166,170 wallets hold between 10,000 and 25,000 XRP, while 159,509 wallets hold between 5,000 and 10,000 tokens.For context, XRP has over 6.5 million wallet addresses. Less than 4% of these addresses hold at least 10,000 XRP. This highlights a significant disparity and how few investors meet this threshold. Conversely, over 5 million addresses hold 500 XRP or fewer, indicating that the majority of XRP holders are retail investors, while whales possess most of the supply.Meanwhile, analysts like Pantoja and Edoardo Farina of Alpha Lions Academy continue to stress the significance of holding 10,000 XRP tokens . According to them, this level of accumulation could lead to unprecedented financial freedom. Pantoja’s latest projection that 10,000 XRP could one day be worth $2.5 million reinforces this vision.With fewer than 4% of XRP wallets at this level, the analysts urge investors to consolidate and build their holdings to reach this threshold and join the top tier of XRP holders.Meanwhile, Pantoja’s proposition implies that XRP would need to rise to $250 per token for 10,000 XRP to be worth $2.5 million. This is a staggering increase of 11,111% from the current price of $2.23.Several analysts have echoed this bullish outlook, with some, like Javon Marks, suggesting a $250 price target could be achieved in this cycle. At that price, XRP’s market cap would reach approximately $15 trillion, up from about $131 billion today.Turning Bitcoin and Ethereum Portfolios Into $2.5 MillionPantoja also proposed that a portfolio containing 1 Bitcoin could be worth $2.5 million in the future. Currently, 1 BTC is at around $105,500. His prediction aligns with that of ARK Invest, which projects a potential price of $2.4 million per Bitcoin by 2030 in an extremely bullish scenario.As for Ethereum, holding 50 ETH today is worth about $125,000. For this portfolio to reach $2.5 million, Ethereum would need to rise to $50,000 per coin. According to prediction outlet Telegaon, ETH could reach that level between 2040 and 2050.Still, these projections, while promising, remain highly speculative.What to Do After Reaching $2.5 MillionPantoja suggests that once investors hit the $2.5 million mark, whether through XRP, Bitcoin, or Ethereum, the next step should be to purchase a home and invest in assets yielding 3% to 5% annually. This strategy, he says, would help cover taxes and allow one to live a life of financial freedom.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/10/angel-investor-says-10000-xrp-portfolio-today-can-turn-into-2-5-million/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=angel-investor-says-10000-xrp-portfolio-today-can-turn-into-2-5-million,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING|XRP","Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction",cryptocompare

2025-06-10T13:35:24,"Semler Scientific: This Bitcoin Proxy Isn't As Cheap As It Seems","Summary Semler Scientific has shifted focus to Bitcoin accumulation, but its stock underperforms BTC and MSTR despite aggressive treasury moves. The stock trades at a premium to its BTC holdings, reflecting both the core healthcare business and Bitcoin strategy, but isn't a bargain. Recent negative free cash flow, declining healthcare revenues, and legal uncertainties add risk and cloud the investment case. Given the fair valuation, execution risks, and better alternatives for Bitcoin exposure (buying BTC directly), I rate SMLR stock as a Hold. Semler Scientific ( SMLR ) used to just be a healthcare technology company focused on a cardiovascular testing product, but it's now like a mini Strategy Inc. ( MSTR ) with its Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) treasury ambitions. While it still has a small underlying healthcare business, Semler is now clearly a Bitcoin-focused company, buying up the asset as fast as it can and using debt and share issuances to do so. It's one of the largest corporate holders of BTC globally. The interesting thing is, if you look at the performance of Bitcoin and MSTR this year, up about 18% and 31%, respectively, and then look at Semler's performance of -38%, you'll notice a huge disconnect. Some may view this as an opportunity. I mean, SMLR stock is down more than 55% from its November 2024 swing high, while MSTR is off ""just"" 29% from its November high. At the same time, BTC is trading near an all-time high. So, what's going on with Semler stock? Should you buy it? There are a few reasons to buy but also a few reasons to avoid, and I don't think there's a clear opportunity here relative to buying BTC itself. I believe the stock is more or less fairly valued despite the underperformance. That's because Semler's market cap is still above the value of its BTC holdings (especially when factoring in net debt). So, I believe the difference between the market cap and the net value of BTC holdings can be thought of as how much the market is valuing the underlying health business, and I think the valuation the market assigns is probably fair but not a bargain. More detail on that later. The premium to the BTC holdings likely also prices in future optionality and leverage, so it's a combination of that and the core business. Another positive note to factor is that the stock has pulled back from a big run-up, so from a technical perspective, it could be ready for a short-term bounce. However, there are some risks involved. First of all, the business generated negative free cash flow in Q1 (which is highly unusual for this company), creating uncertainty. Second, it's hard to know the future trend of the healthcare business, with declining revenues and no estimates from analysts. There used to be analysts providing estimates, but it looks like they've given up. There's also execution risk with the BTC strategy, and I'd caution against buying a BTC-related stock with the crypto near an all-time high. As a result, the stock is a Hold. Let's Break Down The Valuation As of June 3, Semler Scientific held 4,449 BTC . At a price of $110,000 USD per Bitcoin, that's worth approximately $489.39 million. The company also had $9.9 million in cash as of March 31 and $96.1 million in debt (net cash of $86.2 million). Therefore, its BTC + net cash value is $403.2 million. Now, with a diluted share count of 15.653 million as of June 3 and a stock price of $33.99, the company’s market cap is ~$532.05 million. This implies that approximately $128.9 million of the market cap is being attributed to the healthcare business and the value of the BTC strategy itself. I also want to briefly mention that some websites understate its share count because they haven't updated it as of the most recent June 3 update, and this leads to the market cap being understated, which leads investors to thinking the stock is cheaper than it actually is. Is The $128.9M Premium Justified? The premium seems normal, given the pros and cons, which I'll explain. For example, Semler's core business has historically been FCF-positive. However, recent trends muddy the story a bit. In Q1 2025, healthcare revenue fell 44% year-over-year to $8.8 million, driven largely by CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) reimbursement changes. And management's commentary suggests that it's trying to minimize revenue losses from QuantaFlo, suggesting that growth will be harder to come by. For instance, Jennifer Herrington, the company's COO, stated the following during the Q1 earnings call: Our priority for 2025 is to minimize declines to QuantaFlo revenue while maintaining sufficient infrastructure to support, innovate and grow our operations related to other cardiovascular disease states. In addition, Q1 free cash flow was -$2.116 million, when it has always been positive in other quarters. SMLR's Quarterly Free Cash Flow (Finbox) That's a red flag, but it's also somewhat balanced by management's tone. Management stated that it plans to use the company's cash flow from operations to purchase more BTC. Would management say that if they were expecting negative cash flow? I don't think so, but I can't say for sure. Nonetheless, saying this is one thing, but now we need to see if negative cash flow is here to stay or not. We can also look at the company's historical FCF multiple to help us value the company. Prior to the BTC strategy starting in 2024, the stock's price/FCF multiple settled in the mid-teens. Let's call it 15x, for simplicity's sake. Semler's Historical Price/FCF Multiple (Finbox) But before, it was a business with growing FCF and revenue. Now, both metrics are declining. There's also a $29.8 million contingency reserve, which is how much Semler set aside in Q1 for a potential DOJ legal settlement. That adds more uncertainty. Therefore, a 15x multiple is unlikely now. Maybe 8-10x is more reasonable. With its TTM FCF of $16.7 million, an 8-10x multiple suggests a $133.6-167 million valuation for the core business. But will $16.7 million in TTM FCF be maintained, or will it keep dropping? We can also do a quick price/sales valuation. Eyeballing the chart below, the price/sales ratio was generally around 4.5x before the BTC strategy started. Data by YCharts But again, with the business deterioration, 4.5x is unlikely. Maybe 3x is more realistic. If we take the $8.8 million in revenue from Q1 and multiply it by four, we get an annualized revenue figure of $35.2 million. Give that a 3x multiple, and you get a $105.6 million valuation for the business. Overall, based on my quick napkin math, the $128.9 million valuation premium looks justified more or less , especially if you consider the bit of intangible (and hard to quantify) value of the BTC strategy itself. But being ""justified more or less"" isn't good enough. As investors, we generally want companies that trade at discounted valuations. BTC Yield Is Positive But Dependent On Many Factors One of the KPIs management points to is BTC Yield, or the growth in Bitcoin per share over time. It's formally defined by Semler as ""a KPI that represents, for the period specified (year-to-date), the percentage change in the ratio between our Bitcoin Count and our Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding."" In theory, a high BTC yield, which SMLR has (26.7% YTD and 205.3% in 2024), is a good thing, as it signals that the company is buying BTC faster than it is diluting shareholders, increasing BTC per share. Semler's BTC Yield (Semler Scientific's Investor Relations) Nevertheless, this outcome isn't guaranteed. BTC yield depends on a few variables and also management's expertise in deploying capital. It depends on the timing and pricing of share issuances, pricing of debt offerings, and the healthcare business's ability to generate cash flow for BTC purchases. If Semler can issue shares when its stock is trading at a high premium relative to its BTC holdings, then the BTC yield will look strong. But if BTC rises quickly while Semler's stock underperforms, the company would have to issue more shares per BTC, potentially lowering the BTC yield. Management just needs to be smart with the timing of its purchases and equity raises. It has $362 million remaining in its ATM program, so a lot of dilution could be on the way. Hopefully, it'll be done at a good price. Most of the funds for BTC purchases, as of June 3, have come from ATM issuances and convertible bond issuances, as you can see below. Only 18% came from operating cash flow. Semler's Source Of Funds For BTC Purchases (Semler Scientific's June 2025 Presentation) The Pullback Could Signal A Short-Term Bounce Is Near I'm not going to get into this too much, but in simple terms, SMLR is a volatile stock that has fast upswings and downswings. We're in a downswing period, which suggests a bounce could be near. SMLR Stock Chart (TradingView) At the same time, part of that could depend on how BTC performs, but I'd rather buy SMLR or any other BTC-related stock when the BTC price is relatively low. The Bottom Line On SMLR Stock Semler Scientific may look like a great bargain based on its relative underperformance compared to MSTR and Bitcoin this year, but in reality, I don't see any screaming value. My analysis tells me that it's more or less fairly valued. Meanwhile, the company's high BTC yield isn't guaranteed. Fundamentally, there can be upside if the core business improves (if revenue stabilizes and cash flow returns), but there's not too much clarity about that, and there are no analyst estimates, either. Other upside potential can come from a potential rise in the Bitcoin price, but if you're bullish on Bitcoin at current levels, I do think it would be more efficient to just invest in Bitcoin directly (to avoid overcomplicating things), whether through actual BTC exposure or BTC derivatives. On the other hand, you could buy SMLR stock expecting a short-term bounce potentially, but that's strictly technical-analysis based. At the end of the day, the risk/reward opportunity seems balanced, with the market cap trading at a premium to the company's BTC holdings. Consequently, SMLR stock is a Hold.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4793701-semler-scientific-this-bitcoin-proxy-isnt-as-cheap-as-it-seems?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX","BTC-USD|SMLR",cryptocompare

With my experience and knowledge, I'm ready for the United States,” CFTC nominee Quintenz said. The nomination hearing is scheduled for June 10. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-10T13:30:39,"Bitcoin’s $110K Sprint Coincides With Record-Low Exchange Reserves","Bitcoin’s price shook off last week’s dip and climbed sharply on Tuesday morning in Asia, topping $110,000 briefly before settling around $109,450. Traders rushed back in after the asset dipped close to $100,000, feeding a sharp rebound that leaves Bitcoin just 2.8% shy of its record high. A blend of forced liquidations, surging derivatives volume, easing US–China trade tensions and steady on-chain withdrawals is driving the move. Related Reading: Elon Musk ‘Will Do Anything’ To Make XRP King, Tech Mogul Says Heavy Liquidations Shift The Balance According to Coinglass, nearly $203 million in Bitcoin positions were wiped out over the past 24 hours. Of that, $195 million were against shorts. When so many short bets unwind at once, it forces buyers to cover positions, which can send prices spiking. Yet history shows these “short squeezes” can reverse quickly when traders take profits. Based on reports, Bitcoin’s derivatives volume more than doubled, climbing over 110% to $110 billion. Open interest then followed suit, expanding 7.3% to almost $77 billion. These kinds of inflows indicate that new money is accumulating. Both open interest and volume rising tends to indicate enthusiasm—and a willingness to carry through positions with swings. Trade Diplomacy Lifts Risk Assets Talks resumed in London on June 9 between the US and China over tariffs and export rules. Even a hint of progress tends to boost appetite for riskier assets, and Bitcoin isn’t immune. Headlines of smoother trade ties lifted equities earlier this week—and crypto traders moved in tandem. If negotiations hit a snag, though, Bitcoin could slide with global markets. On-Chain Data Shows Steady Accumulation CryptoQuant’s numbers reveal that centralized exchanges have shed 550,000 BTC since July 2024, falling from 1.55 million to about 1.01 million today. As coins leave exchanges, float tightens. At the same time, the Coinbase Premium indicator rose, with US buyers paying more than overseas investors. Santiment also reports renewed accumulation among wallets holding 10–100 BTC. This pattern hints at long-term holding rather than quick trades. Related Reading: Ignore The Trump–Musk Noise: Bitcoin’s Backbone Stays Solid Correlation And Caution Remain When you consider the rally, Bitcoin still dances on the tunes of equity price swings. Futures have mixed bets between bulls and bears, showing portrait-wise signs that certainly not everybody is convinced this run is going to hold. High volatility would tend to wash out weak hands at the slightest hint of trouble, any reversal of risk sentiment, or a sudden macro shock would cost the rally dearly. Optimism is building as analysts talk of fresh all-time highs. Some even eye $150,000 by the end of the year if US debt levels climb further. But sustaining a rally of that magnitude will require more than forced liquidations. Traders will watch derivatives flows, on-chain reserves and trade headlines for signs of real, lasting demand before pushing prices much higher.

2025-06-10T13:20:54,"Crucial US-China Trade Talks Deemed ‘Fruitful’ – What It Means for the Global Economy and Crypto Market","BitcoinWorld Crucial US-China Trade Talks Deemed ‘Fruitful’ – What It Means for the Global Economy and Crypto Market In the ever-watchful world of cryptocurrency, investors often keep a keen eye not just on blockchain developments, but on broader macroeconomic and geopolitical shifts. Why? Because events impacting the global economy can significantly influence market sentiment and asset prices, including digital currencies. Recent news from London regarding US-China trade discussions falls squarely into this category. US-China Trade Talks: A Glimpse into Diplomatic Progress According to the Walter Bloomberg economic news account via X, the US-China trade talks held recently in London were described as “fruitful” by the U.S. Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick. While the specific details of the discussions remain under wraps for now, this positive descriptor offers a potential signal of progress in navigating the complex economic relationship between the world’s two largest economies. Here’s a quick rundown of the reported details: Location: London Participants: Representatives from the U.S. and China, including reported comments from U.S. Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick. Duration: Approximately six hours for the recent session. Outcome Description: Characterized as “fruitful.” Next Steps: Talks are scheduled to resume on June 10 at 10 a.m. These high-level trade talks are crucial because the economic ties between the United States and China are deeply intertwined, affecting everything from supply chains and manufacturing to technology and financial markets globally. Any signs of de-escalation or constructive dialogue are generally viewed positively by market participants seeking stability. Why Do These Economic Relations Matter for Crypto? You might be wondering, how does a meeting about international economic relations in London relate to your Bitcoin or Ethereum holdings? The connection, while not direct, is significant. The cryptocurrency market, despite its decentralized nature, does not exist in a vacuum. It is increasingly influenced by global liquidity, investor risk appetite, and the overall health of the traditional financial system. Think of it this way: Market Sentiment: Positive developments in major geopolitical or economic spheres, like improved US-China trade relations, can boost overall market confidence. This can lead to increased appetite for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Conversely, tensions can cause uncertainty and drive investors towards perceived safer havens. Global Liquidity: Trade and economic policies between major powers impact global capital flows. Stable and growing economic relations can support global economic growth, potentially increasing the pool of capital available for investment across various asset classes, including crypto. Inflation and Monetary Policy: Trade dynamics can influence inflation rates and, consequently, central bank monetary policies. These policies (like interest rate changes) have a profound impact on market liquidity and investor behavior, directly affecting crypto valuations. Technological Competition: Discussions often touch upon technology, which is intrinsically linked to blockchain and digital innovation. While not explicitly about crypto regulation, these talks set the stage for future international cooperation or competition in digital economies. Therefore, monitoring key geopolitical and economic indicators, such as the outcome of these trade talks , provides valuable context for understanding broader market movements that can affect your crypto portfolio. Challenges and Opportunities in US-China Economic Relations While the term “fruitful” is encouraging, it’s important to acknowledge that significant challenges remain in US-China trade relations. Issues such as trade imbalances, intellectual property rights, technology restrictions, and market access have been points of contention for years. Challenges: Deep-seated structural economic differences. Ongoing technology competition and restrictions (e.g., semiconductors). Trust deficits built over past disputes. Potential for sudden shifts in diplomatic tone. Opportunities presented by ‘Fruitful’ Talks: Reduced uncertainty for businesses and investors. Potential for collaboration on shared global issues (climate change, pandemics). Smoother supply chains, potentially easing inflationary pressures. Improved environment for international investment. For the crypto market impact , reduced global economic uncertainty generally translates to a more stable or positive environment for risk assets. Conversely, a breakdown in talks or renewed tensions could trigger risk-off sentiment, potentially leading to sell-offs in crypto alongside traditional markets. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Investor Given the influence of these high-level trade talks on the global economy and, by extension, the crypto market, what should a crypto investor do? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Pay attention to major geopolitical and macroeconomic news, not just crypto-specific headlines. Understand how events like these trade talks can serve as macro indicators. Contextualize Market Movements: If the crypto market sees significant volatility, consider if major global economic or political events could be contributing factors alongside crypto-native news. Assess Risk Appetite: Developments in economic relations between major powers often signal shifts in global risk appetite. A positive shift might favor growth assets like crypto, while negative news could indicate a move towards safer assets. Diversify (Wisely): While crypto is a specific asset class, understanding its correlation with broader markets during different economic climates is key. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket based solely on crypto news; consider the wider economic backdrop. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term market reactions to news events can be sharp, the long-term trajectory of crypto is driven by its underlying technology and adoption. Use macro news for context, but maintain a long-term perspective on your core investment thesis. The fact that talks are resuming indicates an ongoing process. The outcome of future sessions will continue to be relevant for understanding the global economic climate and its potential flow-through effects on financial markets, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. Concluding Thoughts: Navigating the Interconnected Global Economy The report of “fruitful” US-China trade talks in London, as noted by U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, is a positive signal in the complex landscape of international economic relations . While not directly about Bitcoin or blockchain, these discussions are a vital part of the global economy that ultimately influences market sentiment, liquidity, and investor behavior – all factors that contribute to the ebb and flow of the crypto market. Keeping an eye on these high-level trade talks provides crucial context for any crypto investor looking to understand the broader forces at play beyond the immediate crypto ecosystem. The interconnectedness of global finance means that progress, or lack thereof, in diplomatic and economic dialogues between major powers will continue to have a tangible crypto market impact .

2025-06-10T13:15:15,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Is BTC Ready to Break its All-Time High?","Bitcoin remains technically bullish, with strong buyer interest evident after the recent liquidity sweep around the $100K mark. A breakout above $111K would likely trigger aggressive upside continuation. However, short-term volatility and potential resistance should be expected as the price navigates this critical zone. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart BTC has recently swept a critical liquidity zone just around the $100K mark, triggering a strong, impulsive rally that reflects significant demand entering the market. This surge has propelled the price to its all-time high of $111K, signaling renewed bullish momentum. A key area of buy-side liquidity lies just above the $111K ATH, making it an attractive target for institutional and “smart money” participants. If bullish momentum holds and buyers manage to breach this level, a sharp move higher, potentially driven by a short squeeze, could follow. However, this zone also overlaps with a likely area of profit-taking and increased supply, which may temporarily slow or cap upward momentum. While a bullish breakout appears imminent, a minor pullback or short-term correction cannot be ruled out. At present, BTC remains range-bound between $100K and $111K, with the breakout direction likely determining the next macro trend. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, Bitcoin has seen a strong influx of buyers around the $100K level, leading to a breakout above a recently formed bullish flag pattern. This breakout confirms the continuation of the upward trend. Currently, the price action is approaching a 4-hour Order Block, a key area where supply is expected to re-enter the market. If bulls can reclaim this zone and sustain momentum, BTC could make a swift move toward price discovery and a new ATH. That said, a short-term rejection or a pullback to retest the breakout level is still a viable scenario before the next leg up. For now, Bitcoin is consolidating within a tighter $105K–$111K range on the 4-hour chart. This consolidation phase could serve as a launchpad for the next impulsive rally. On-chain Analysis By ShayanMarkets As Bitcoin hovers just below its all-time high of $111K, a closer look at futures market data, particularly the BTC/USDT liquidation heatmap on Binance, offers critical insights into potential price movements. It reveals two major liquidity clusters: one positioned above the $111K level and another just below $100K. These zones are situated near the current price and represent prime areas where smart money may aim to trigger liquidations of overleveraged retail positions. A decisive move beyond either threshold could ignite a liquidation cascade, accelerating price action in that direction. Given the prevailing bullish sentiment and broader market structure, a breakout above the $111K resistance appears increasingly likely in the mid-term. Such a move would not only confirm market strength but could also fuel momentum toward a fresh all-time high.

However, last month, 22 more companies joined in, bringing the total to 126. Together, they now hold over 819,000 Bitcoin. While corporate treasuries keep loading up on BTC. Here’s what you missed overnight and what to watch today. European Firm Goes All-In on Bitcoin In Europe, the Paris-based Blockchain Group is going all-in. They’re planning to raise €300 million (about $340 million) just to buy more bitcoin. It’s one of the biggest bitcoin moves from a European company, showing how much crypto fever has gripped the corporate world. Matthew Sigel from VanEck says this trend is not just a one-off. He points out that big names like MicroStrategy and Cantor Equity Partners have a combined war chest of $76 billion. That’s more than half of what’s locked up in all bitcoin ETFs today. It’s also way more than the money flowing into these funds over the last 16 months. Clearly, companies are serious about owning bitcoin for the long haul. BlackRock’s Bitcoin Bet Breaks Records BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust is also making headlines. It shot past $70 billion in assets in just under a year, a record pace that left even gold funds in the dust. The trust alone saw $2.7 billion in trading volume in just one day. That’s a massive vote of confidence in bitcoin’s staying power. Eyes on Inflation and the Fed Investors are also watching the U.S. Consumer Price Index numbers coming out on June 11 and the big Federal Reserve meeting on June 18 . If inflation picks up or the Fed hints at new policies, it could be another push for bitcoin’s price. Bitcoin Eying For $130K Meanwhile, veteran trader Merlijn The Trader says that Bitcoin may have officially entered the final phase of its parabolic run. After staying quiet for months and breaking out of tough spots, the price has jumped over $100,000. Merlijn says this last push usually leads to crazy gains, then people doubting it, and finally, late buyers jumping in because they’re scared to miss out. If this happens again, Bitcoin might soon hit $130,000 faster than people think. As of now, it is trading around $109,670 , reflecting a rise of 2% seen in the last 24 hours.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-on-fire-companies-pour-in-billions-as-130000-price-target-looms/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|TRADING","News",cryptocompare
2025-06-10T13:07:40,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Ark CEO Cathie Wood Sees $1.5M BTC Within 5 Years — Is She Right?","Bitcoin is once again capturing headlines, not just for its price rally, but for a staggering new forecast. Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood said in a recent podcast that Bitcoin could climb to $1.5 million in the next five years. That’s more than a 15x gain from current levels near $109,336, and it’s sparking fresh interest among retail and institutional investors alike. Wood made her case during an episode of The Diary of a CEO, emphasizing that Bitcoin is evolving into a “new asset class”, one she likens to the early days of equity markets in the 1600s. Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood explains why she thinks #Bitcoin will multiply by 15x in the next five years. pic.twitter.com/rn8YER75jh — Crypto Aman (@cryptoamanclub) June 9, 2025 Her forecast isn’t based on hype, but rather on fundamentals: scarcity, security, and growing institutional interest. With nearly 20 million out of 21 million BTC already mined, supply is drying up—making each remaining coin more valuable by design. Scarcity, Security, and Institutional Trust; Bitcoin Supported? Bitcoin’s scarcity is central to its appeal. Unlike fiat currencies that can be printed endlessly, Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, and around 94% has already been mined. At today’s prices, the remaining 1 million+ coins are worth over $100 billion. As availability shrinks, upward price pressure builds—especially if demand continues to rise. Wood also highlighted Bitcoin’s impeccable security record: its base layer hasn’t been hacked since its inception in 2009. This unmatched track record makes it one of the most resilient systems in global finance. It’s a point of confidence for institutions allocating capital, especially as crypto-related cybercrime draws regulatory scrutiny. Bitcoin price: $109,336 24H trading volume: $57.9B Market cap: $2.17T Circulating supply: 19.87M BTC These fundamentals, according to Wood, underpin Bitcoin’s shift from an alternative currency into a strategic investment class. Technical Set-Up: Is Bitcoin Ready to Break $110K? Beyond macro tailwinds, Bitcoin price prediction seems bullish on the charts. After reclaiming the $106,737 breakout zone and the 50-period EMA near $106,339, BTC is now consolidating just below $110,668, a key resistance level. Price is moving inside a rising parallel channel, with a series of spinning top candles suggesting a pause, but not a reversal. The MACD remains bullish, though its slope is flattening. A confirmed breakout could accelerate the next leg up. Trade Setup: Entry: Above $110,700 Target: $112,700, then $115,103 Stop-loss: Below $108,600 Conclusion Between Wood’s $1.5M long-term call and the bullish near-term structure, Bitcoin’s case for a breakout is strengthening. As long as BTC stays above $108,627, technicals favor the bulls—and institutional momentum may do the rest. BTC Bull Token Nears $8M Cap as 58% APY Staking Attracts Last-Minute Buyers With Bitcoin trading near $102K, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The project has now raised $7,032,776.85 out of its $8,011,104 cap, leaving less than $1 million before the next token price hike. The current price of $0.002555 is expected to increase once the cap is hit. BTC Bull Token links its value directly to Bitcoin through two core mechanisms: BTC Airdrops reward holders, with presale participants receiving priority. Supply Burns occur automatically every time BTC increases by $50,000, reducing $BTCBULL’s circulating supply. The token also features a 58% APY staking pool holding over 1.81 billion tokens, offering: The token also features a 61% APY staking pool holding over 1.73 billion tokens, offering: No lockups or fees Full liquidity Stable passive yields, even in volatile markets This staking model appeals to both DeFi veterans and newcomers seeking hands-off income. With just hours left and the hard cap nearly reached, momentum is building fast. BTCBULL ’s blend of Bitcoin-linked value, scarcity mechanics, and flexible staking is fueling strong demand. Early buyers have a limited time to enter before the next pricing tier activates.

2025-06-10T13:03:08,"Crypto Price Analysis 6-10: BITCOIN: BTC, ETHEREUM: ETH, SOLANA: SOL, LITECOIN: LTC, UNISWAP: UNI, FILECOIN: FIL","The crypto market shot upwards as Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies overcame initial sluggishness to register substantial increases and trade in positive territory. BTC was trading around $105,000 on Monday before picking up momentum and rising to $107,000. The flagship cryptocurrency continued pushing higher, crossing $110,000 before registering a marginal decline and moving to its current level. BTC is up nearly 4% in the past 24 hours, trading around $109,390. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) rallied after reclaiming $2,500, with the price up over 7%, trading around $2,667. Ripple (XRP) is up over 2%, while Solana (SOL) is up over 5%, trading at $157. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up nearly 6%, trading at $0.191, while Cardano (ADA) is up 6%, trading at $0.697. Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Toncoin (TON) , Hedera (HBAR) , Litecoin (LTC) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered substantial increases. Crypto CEO Accused Of Laundering Funds Linked To Sanctioned Russian Banks Federal prosecutors have charged the founder of a US-based crypto payments firm with allegedly operating a sophisticated international money laundering scheme to move over $500 million linked to sanctioned Russian banks and other entities. According to reports, Iurii Gugnin, a Russian national living in Manhattan, was arrested and arraigned on Monday and ordered to be held without bail pending trial. Gugnin faces a 22-count indictment and is accused of wire and bank fraud, violating US sanctions and export controls, money laundering, and failing to implement legally required anti-money laundering protocols. Assistant Attorney General Eisenberg stated, “The defendant is charged with turning a cryptocurrency company into a covert pipeline for dirty money, moving over half a billion dollars through the U.S. financial system to aid sanctioned Russian banks and help Russian end-users acquire sensitive U.S. technology.” Prosecutors alleged that Gugnin used his companies, Evita Investments, and Evita Pay, to process over $500 million in payments while concealing their origin, nature, and purpose. The list of clients included individuals and businesses linked to sanctioned Russian banks and financial institutions like Sberbank, VTB Bank, Sovcombank, Tinkoff, and the state-owned nuclear energy firm Rosatom. UK Appoints Crypto Specialist To Recover Funds From Bankruptcy Cases The UK Insolvency Service has appointed a crypto intelligence specialist to help recover crypto from criminal and bankruptcy cases. According to a statement from the Insolvency Service, Andrew Small, a former police investigator with a background in economic crimes and offenses, will lead efforts to locate and recover crypto assets. The appointment comes as insolvency cases in the UK have increased by 420% over the past five years. The estimated value of crypto assets has also significantly increased during the same time period. “There has been a rapid rise in crypto ownership in the UK, and alongside that, we’ve seen a similar rise in crypto asset ownership in bankruptcy cases. Crypto is very much a recoverable asset.” The UK’s Insolvency Service has been tasked with recovering money and assets from individuals and companies in insolvency cases and returning as much of the funds owed to creditors. Small will provide specialist knowledge about the different types of cryptocurrencies available and the associated technologies available to buy, sell, and store them. Neil Freebury, the head of intelligence at the Insolvency Service, expects Small to enhance collaboration and strengthen outcomes for investigators working on crypto asset ownership cases. Freebury stated, “His appointment will help our investigators dealing with cases where crypto asset ownership is a factor.” Lawmakers Propose Amendment to Crypto Market Structure Bill US lawmakers on the House Financial Services are expected to convene for a markup hearing on Tuesday, where they will consider a cryptocurrency market structure bill, which will be amended to add additional protection for blockchain developers. According to a statement released before the hearing, Committee Chair French Hill introduced an amendment to the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act 2025. The amendment focuses on the treatment of certain non-controlling blockchain developers. It proposes that under potential market structure law, blockchain developers or service providers will not be considered money transmitters or be subject to their registration requirements. The hearing will also include a discussion and vote for amendments to the CLARITY Act. Meanwhile, the Senate is expected to vote on the GENIUS Act, legislation to regulate stablecoins. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he wants the bill to be “wrapped up” this week. According to Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal, stablecoin legislation has made substantial progress thanks to bipartisan support. “I think stablecoin legislation has made incredible progress, in large part because I think there is a fairly consistent bipartisan consensus that it’s in the United States’ interest to have sensible rules for stablecoins. A market structure bill is equally important for long-term stability and growth.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) overcame a sluggish start to the week to register a healthy 4% lead and crossed $110,000 on Monday, ultimately settling at $110,251. However, the flagship cryptocurrency is trading in the red during the ongoing session, down nearly 1% and trading around $109,310. BTC’s move past $110,000 on Monday was the first time it crossed the level in two weeks as markets become hopeful about the outcome of ongoing talks between the US and China. Monday’s surge also saw short positions liquidated. BTC isn’t far from its all-time high, with market experts predicting a new all-time high if current sentiment persists. Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, stated, “Bitcoin breaking above $110,000 for the first time in two weeks signals renewed bullish momentum after a period of consolidation. If BTC can hold this level, it may set the stage for a fresh push toward the $120,000 range.” However, more conservative voices predict a correction before a push higher, expecting CPI data to trigger more volatility in the market. The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers are due for Tuesday, with markets fearing Trump’s tariffs could add pressure on an already volatile market. Analysts have predicted the CPI to rise 0.3% month-over-month and 2.3% year-over-year. Meanwhile, Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, is expected to rise 0.3% month-over-month and 2.9% year-over-year. A jump in inflation could reduce the possibility of a Fed rate cut. Private wealth manager Swissblock stated in a post on X, “Bitcoin, what is the plan? Inflation data in the week ahead could unleash volatility. The bulls are slowly rebuilding their structure and regrouping, and are eager to flip the game. First steps are in, but a short-term test of the lower range ($104k) looks likely.” However, the pullback is expected to be temporary, with BTC bulls still in control. BTC traded in positive territory the previous weekend, rising 0.69% on Saturday and almost 1% on Sunday to cross $105,000 and settle at $105,779. The price plunged to an intraday low of $103,768 on Monday before recovering to register a marginal increase and settle at $105,902. BTC was back in the red Tuesday, falling 0.44% to $105,436. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price dropped almost 1%, slipping below $105,000 and settling at $104,752. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC plunged 3%, falling to an intraday low of $100,424 before ultimately settling at $101,614. Source: TradingView The price recovered on Friday, rising nearly 3% to recoup its losses and settle at $104,378. BTC continued pushing higher on Saturday, rising over 1% to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,575. Buyers retained control on Sunday despite waning bullish sentiment as BTC registered a marginal increase to end the weekend at $105,784. BTC got off to a sluggish start on Monday. However, sentiment picked up as it surged over 4% to cross the 20-day SMA and $110,000 and settle at $110,251. The current session sees BTC down nearly 1%, trading around $109,110. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) registered a dramatic increase on Monday as it surged to an intraday high of $2,694. However, it fell short of the $2,700 mark and is marginally down during the ongoing session as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency faces an uphill battle to overcome $2,700, a crucial resistance. If tETH overcomes this level, it could rally to $3,000. However, if the bears reverse the positive sentiment, ETH risks a drop to $2,400 or lower. Meanwhile, Ethereum ETFs continue to register healthy inflows. The investment products have recorded inflows totaling $857 million since May 16, with analysts predicting them to cross the $1 billion milestone shortly. The ETFs recorded over $25 million in inflows on June 6 alone to cap off a third week of trading in the green. Marcin Kazmierczak, co-founder and COO of Redstone, stated, “ETH’s momentum appears driven by several converging factors: institutional ETF flows showing renewed interest in ETH products, growing anticipation around Ethereum’s roadmap upgrades.” Optimism around the asset has also been boosted by the Pectra upgrade, with Luke Nolan, senior Ethereum research associate at CoinShares, stating, “I think a few factors are lining up in ETH's favor. Firstly, we had the Pectra upgrade on May 7, which included a number of changes to the Ethereum protocol. None of them were that major, but they indicated stepping stones for further scaling, which has been a major bottleneck for a while on Ethereum. I also think sometimes a small narrative is enough to help drive positivity.” ETH price action was mixed the previous weekend, registering a marginal decline on Saturday and then rising 0.44% on Sunday to settle at $2,539. The price fell to an intraday low of $2,476 on Monday before recovering to register an increase of nearly 3% to cross the 20-day SMA and $2,600 and settle at $2,607. It registered a marginal decline on Tuesday before rising 0.52% on Wednesday to reclaim $2,600 and move to $2,607.

However, the price is marginally down during the ongoing session, trading around $2,675. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana’s (SOL) was rejected from the $160 level, temporarily pausing its upward trajectory. The price is down 2% during the ongoing session as sellers look to lower it. If selling pressure persists, SOL could drop to $140, where buyers may step in. SOL faced selling pressure and volatility the previous weekend as sellers attempted to overwhelm buyers. However, the altcoin registered a marginal increase on Saturday and rose nearly 1% on Sunday despite falling to a low of $150 to settle at $157. The price plunged to an intraday low of $151 on Monday before rebounding to settle at $156, ultimately registering a marginal decline. SOL raced to an intraday high of $164 on Tuesday but lost momentum after reaching this level. As a result, SOL fell over 1% to $155. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price fell 1.29% to $153. Selling pressure intensified on Thursday as SOL plunged nearly 6%, slipping below $150 and settling at $144. Source: TradingView Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, SOL recovered on Friday, rising 2.47% to $147. Buyers retained control over the weekend as the price rose 1.51% on Saturday and 1.56% on Sunday to reclaim $150 and settle at $152. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as SOL surged almost 6% to cross $160 and settle at $161. However, the price is back in the red during the ongoing session, down nearly 2%, trading around $158. Litecoin (LTC) Price Analysis Litecoin (LTC) registered a sharp drop on Friday (May 30), falling over 8% to $85.61. Despite the selling pressure, it recovered over the weekend, rising 1.70% on Saturday and 1.47% on Sunday to end the weekend at $88.35.

Despite the strong start to the week, LTC is back in bearish territory in the ongoing session, down nearly 1%, trading around $90.16 as sellers look to drive the price below $90. Uniswap (UNI) Price Analysis Uniswap (UNI) has jumped nearly 14% over the past 24 hours as the token surged after breaking out of its months-long consolidation phase, with analysts predicting a significant rally. Trading volumes are also reaching record levels as sentiment around the token flips to bullish. UNI surged past $6 over the weekend and has crossed $7 during the ongoing session, with buyers in control. UNI started the previous weekend in the red, dropping nearly 3% on Saturday and settling at $6.04. The price rebounded on Sunday, rising over 4% to cross the 20-day SMA and settle at $6.30.
