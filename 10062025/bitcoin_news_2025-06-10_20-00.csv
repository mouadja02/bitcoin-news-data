2025-06-10T17:55:48,"Bitcoin's Rally Paves the Way for Altcoins: 3 Projects Ready to Explode After the Latest BTC Surge","As Bitcoin’s latest surge sends ripples through the crypto world , a wave of excitement builds around other digital currencies. Eyes are now on three specific projects poised for significant growth. Discover which altcoins are primed to explode following Bitcoin's impressive rally, offering potential high rewards for keen investors. Aave Price Movements Reinforce Key Entry and Exit Zones Aave has seen dynamic price swings over the past month and six months. The coin rose about 26.62% in the last month, showing a burst of short-term strength and increased buying interest. In contrast, performance over the past six months slipped approximately 4.32%, highlighting a mixed longer-term picture. A weekly gain of roughly 12.01% adds to the recent optimism, even though the extended view reveals persistent challenges. Price volatility remains evident as the market digests these varied trends. Currently, Aave trades between $179.40 and $298.70, with a key resistance level near $350.42 that traders watch with keen interest. Bulls are entering aggressively at times, driving the price upward, yet bears still step in during pullbacks, resulting in an unclear overall trend direction. While the short-term rally hints at bullish energy, the technical setup remains cautious. A support level at approximately $111.81 offers a potential floor, encouraging entries close to this zone if a bounce is detected. A breakout above $350.42 could trigger aggressive buying, though traders should be mindful of the second resistance at $469.73. Uniswap Market Snapshot: Recent Volatility and Key Price Levels Price action over the past month and half-year shows notable swings. Uniswap advanced by 9.60% in one week, yet declined by 6.39% over the month and dropped sharply by 58.74% over the half-year period. Fluctuations reached heights in a narrow range, hinting at recovery attempts after deep corrections. Movements spanned from resilient surges to broad downtrends, revealing periods of optimism followed by significant pullbacks. These variations point to a market that, while capable of sharp upward bursts, remains vulnerable to extended declines during broader market weaknesses. Currently, Uniswap trades within a range between $4.62 and $7.58, with a key support level at $3.20 and nearby resistance at $9.12. Second support at $0.239 and an additional resistance near $12.08 further outline trading boundaries. Indicators suggest mixed signals with upward pressure present, yet caution is warranted due to earlier declines. Bulls are attempting to assert dominance, but the lack of a clear trend encourages careful trading. Traders should consider positioning near support while planning exits at resistance if the price breaks above this area. Bittensor Price Trends and Key Levels for Trading Opportunities Bittensor experienced mixed behavior in recent trading sessions. In the last month, prices declined by about 7.7% after a brief rise of 6.19%. Over the past six months, the coin’s value dropped significantly by almost 28.65%, showing prolonged downward pressure. The recent weekly bounce did little to offset the negative trend, emphasizing the coin’s vulnerability to volatility. These statistics highlight a short-term strength amid ongoing weakness. Current trading levels for Bittensor show a price range between $346 and $507, with immediate resistance at $583.90 and support at $262.30. A second resistance is at $744.70, while a lower support lies at $101.50. Technical indicators suggest that bulls and bears are balanced, as the price moves within a narrow channel. Traders might consider buying near support levels while remaining cautious until a clear trend emerges. Conclusion The recent surge in Bitcoin has set the stage for other cryptocurrencies to shine. AAVE , UNI , and TAO are among the projects poised to benefit. These coins have strong fundamentals and promising potential. This momentum can translate to significant growth for these assets, making them worth watching in the coming months. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-06-10T17:45:11,"$5 ADA Target Envisioned for Cardano as Whales Scoop Up Over 120 Million ADA in a Day","Cardano (ADA) traded mildly weaker on Tuesday despite a strong showing earlier in the week. The broader crypto market experienced a pullback led by Bitcoin’s dip to around $108,923 at press time. However, ADA’s resilience over the past few days, with four consecutive bullish daily candles since Friday, has analysts eyeing a potential breakout that could rival its all-time highs. Popular crypto analyst Javon Marks has reignited bullish sentiment, tweeting that Cardano could surge as much as 666% from current levels. “Using ADA (Cardano)’s previous bull cycle as a guide for this one,” Marks wrote, “ prices could be setting up for another move to and above its 1.272 Fibonacci Level, which is currently at the ~$5.35 price point.” Notably, this mirrors a similar prediction he made in March, reinforcing his long-term outlook based on Fibonacci extension models. If his forecast holds, it would mark one of the most substantial rallies among major altcoins. Marks isn’t the only analyst turning bullish on ADA. Master Ananda also pointed to a consistent pattern of higher lows since June 2023. According to him, recent support zones formed between February and April 2025 suggest a breakout could soon take shape. “Cardano looks great,” Ananda tweeted . “ After four weeks of retrace, we can expect soon higher prices. $2.65 and $4.29 are the main targets.” Adding to the optimism, analyst Trend Rider highlighted a possible “double bottom” formation in ADA’s chart. This is a bullish reversal pattern that, according to academic research, predicts price increases with about 65% accuracy when confirmed by trading volume. That said, the growing bullish sentiment is also being supported by on-chain data. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed Tuesday that whales have accumulated over 120 million ADA tokens in the past 48 hours, based on data from Santiment. Whale activity of this magnitude often precedes price rallies, as it signals rising confidence from influential market players. Beyond price charts and market speculation, Cardano’s fundamental developments are strengthening the case for a long-term rally. On Monday, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson announced the launch of “Cardinal”, the blockchain’s first Bitcoin-backed DeFi protocol. Cardinal allows users to engage in defi using BTC on Cardano without relying on centralized custodians, utilizing advanced cryptographic tools like MuSig2 and wrapped UTXO. The Cardinal protocol enables BTC to be used across DeFi platforms such as MinswapDEX, SundaeSwap, and Fluid Tokens for trading, lending, and collateral, all while preserving full self-custody. Following the announcement, ADA’s trading volume soared nearly 70% to $839 million, with ADA climbing 2.36% in the past 24 hours to trade at $0.7 at press time.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/5-ada-target-envisioned-for-cardano-as-whales-scoop-up-over-120-million-ada-in-a-day/,"ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano",cryptocompare
2025-06-10T17:39:10,"Bitcoin Demand Soars: US Investors Pull BTC From Exchanges Signaling Strong Conviction","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Demand Soars: US Investors Pull BTC From Exchanges Signaling Strong Conviction The cryptocurrency market is always buzzing with activity, but recent data points towards a significant shift specifically within the United States. We’re seeing compelling evidence that U.S. Bitcoin demand is experiencing a notable resurgence, driven by factors that suggest long-term conviction rather than speculative trading. Understanding the Surge in U.S. Bitcoin Demand One of the most closely watched indicators for U.S. buying interest in Bitcoin is the Coinbase Premium. This metric tracks the price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase, a major U.S. exchange, and other global exchanges like Binance. A positive premium suggests stronger buying pressure on Coinbase compared to elsewhere, often signaling demand from U.S.-based investors, both retail and institutional. According to data from on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, the Coinbase Premium has recently reached its highest level since February 3rd, hitting a significant $109.55. This substantial premium indicates that buyers on Coinbase are willing to pay a premium for Bitcoin, a clear sign of robust U.S. demand entering the market. Significant Bitcoin Exchange Withdrawals Point to Long-Term Holding Beyond the premium on U.S. exchanges, another critical data point supporting the narrative of increasing Bitcoin exchange withdrawals. Since July 2024, a staggering 550,000 BTC have been pulled from known exchange wallets. This movement is particularly significant because it often suggests investors are moving their assets into cold storage or private wallets, signaling an intent to hold for the long term rather than keeping funds on exchanges for potential quick selling. Think of it this way: if you plan to sell your Bitcoin soon, you keep it on an exchange for easy access. If you believe the price will rise significantly over time and you intend to hold for months or years, you withdraw it to a more secure, non-custodial wallet. The large volume of these withdrawals points to a collective investor mindset focused on accumulation and holding. What Does the Coinbase Premium Tell Us About BTC Demand? Let’s delve a little deeper into the Coinbase Premium. While $109.55 might seem like a small number relative to Bitcoin’s price, it represents a significant percentage difference that traders and analysts pay close attention to. Historically, periods of sustained positive Coinbase Premium have coincided with strong upward price movements for Bitcoin, as it reflects consistent buying pressure from a major market participant base. The recent spike suggests that despite any recent price corrections or sideways movement, the appetite for acquiring Bitcoin among U.S. investors remains strong. This persistent buying is absorbing available supply, contributing to the upward price pressure observed in the market. Expert Bitcoin Market Analysis on Current Trends On-chain data provides valuable insights, but expert interpretation helps piece the puzzle together. Crypto analyst Crypto Dan weighed in on the trend of exchange withdrawals, suggesting that this behavior reflects a typical pattern seen during a post-correction bullish cycle. In such cycles, savvy investors tend to accumulate during price dips and then move those holdings off exchanges in anticipation of future price appreciation. Another analyst, known as Baykuş, echoed this sentiment, noting that investors are steadily pulling BTC off exchanges. Baykuş interprets this as a clear signal of strong conviction to hold rather than sell. This reinforces the idea that current buyers are not short-term speculators but rather individuals and institutions with a longer time horizon, confident in Bitcoin’s future value. Here’s a quick summary of the key data points and analyst insights: Coinbase Premium: Reached $109.55, highest since Feb 3rd, indicating strong U.S. buying pressure. Exchange Withdrawals: 550,000 BTC withdrawn since July 2024, suggesting movement towards long-term holding. Crypto Dan’s View: Withdrawal behavior is typical of a post-correction bullish accumulation phase. Baykuş’s View: Steady withdrawals signal strong investor conviction to hold rather than sell. Implications of Strong U.S. Conviction What does this mean for the broader Bitcoin market analysis? When long-term holders remove supply from exchanges, it reduces the amount of Bitcoin readily available for sale. With persistent demand, especially from a major market like the U.S., a reduction in available supply can create a supply shock, potentially leading to upward price pressure. The combination of rising Coinbase Premium and significant exchange outflows paints a picture of a market where new demand is being met with reduced selling pressure from those accumulating. This dynamic is often characteristic of periods preceding or during bullish price trends. Challenges and Considerations While the data is compelling, it’s important to remember that the crypto market can be volatile. Macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, and unexpected events can still impact price action. However, the underlying trend of strong U.S. accumulation and withdrawal from exchanges provides a bullish fundamental backdrop that is difficult to ignore. Actionable Insights for Investors For those following the market, these indicators suggest that significant players, particularly in the U.S., are positioning themselves for potential long-term gains. While this analysis is positive, it is crucial to conduct your own research (DYOR) and consider your own risk tolerance before making any investment decisions. Understanding these on-chain metrics can provide valuable context, but they are just one piece of the puzzle. Conclusion: A Bullish Signal from the West The data is clear: U.S. demand for Bitcoin is surging, and investors are backing up that demand with action, moving hundreds of thousands of BTC off exchanges. The elevated Coinbase Premium confirms robust buying interest, while the large-scale withdrawals signal a strong conviction to hold for the future. Coupled with expert analysis pointing towards a post-correction accumulation phase, these trends paint a decidedly bullish picture for Bitcoin from the perspective of U.S. market participation. This confluence of factors suggests that many are anticipating further upside and are securing their positions for the long haul.

2025-06-10T17:32:13,"Analyst Says Ethereum Is ‘Closer to $20K Than Most Anticipate’ Based on This Technical Pattern","Ethereum (ETH) showed renewed strength this week, clim bing strongly alongside Bitcoin since Monday and edging out of a multi-day stretch of low volatility some jokingly called the newest “stablecoin.” But while the recent price movement may seem modest, some analysts believe the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization could be gearing up for a much larger breakout. According to market analyst Gert van Lagen, Ethereum may be significantly undervalued at current levels. In a post on Monday, van Lagen pointed to a clear inverse head and shoulders formation developing on Ethereum’s two-week chart. This bullish technical pattern often signals a major trend reversal. He projects a potential upside target of $19,500, a price level that would mark a new all-time high for ETH and nearly five times its current value. “ ETH [2W] may be closer to $20k than most anticipate,” van Lagen tweeted , emphasizing that a 1.5-year descending broadening wedge, a separate bullish pattern, is also unfolding, reinforcing the potential for a powerful upward breakout. Elsewhere, analyst Master Ananda added weight to the bullish case, noting that Ethereum recently broke above the 200-day moving average, a long-term indicator that traders often view as a signal of sustained bullish momentum. According to Ananda, this is the first time ETH has moved above this line from a low point since November 2024. “This is massive,” he stated on Tradingview, describing it as one of the most reliable bullish indicators in technical analysis. “ Ethereum is now ready to grow for six months straight, minimum.” Ananda forecasted potential price levels of $5,790 and $8,513 in the coming bullish wave, but cautioned that the real upside could extend far beyond those figures. In the background, activity on the Ethereum network is also soaring, which has historically been a precursor for price growth, according to data from blockchain analytics platform GrowThePie. Additionally, institutional confidence in Ethereum appears to be strengthening. According to a research note by analysts at Bernstein on Monday, Ethereum is entering a critical phase of recognition as a foundational layer for financial innovation. The analysts cited rising inflows into Ethereum ETFs, $815 million over the past 20 days and $658 million year-to-date, as evidence of growing investor interest. They noted that while Bitcoin remains a popular store of value, Ethereum is gaining attention for its real-world utility, particularly in areas like stablecoin issuance and tokenized assets. That said, as global payment firms like Visa, Stripe, and Mastercard build stablecoin strategies, Ethereum’s role in powering these systems is becoming harder to ignore. Bernstein analysts argued that Ethereum is no longer just an experimental protocol but a key player in the evolving digital finance landscape. ETH was trading at $2,739 at press time, reflecting an 6.69% surge over the past 24 hours.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/analyst-says-ethereum-is-closer-to-20k-than-most-anticipate-based-on-this-technical-pattern/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Ethereum|News|Ethereum News",cryptocompare
2025-06-10T17:31:42,"Bitcoin: Explosive Breakout Confirms Bullish Uptrend","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: Explosive Breakout Confirms Bullish Uptrend Hey there, fellow crypto enthusiasts! Are you watching the charts? Because Bitcoin price just made a move that’s got everyone talking. After a period of consolidation, BTC has decisively broken out of a significant technical pattern, suggesting that the upward momentum might be far from over. This isn’t just noise; it’s a signal that many analysts believe points towards the continuation of the current bullish trend . Understanding the Bitcoin Bullish Triangle Breakout So, what exactly happened? Bitcoin’s price action recently formed what technical analysts call a ‘bullish triangle’ pattern. This pattern typically occurs during an uptrend when the price consolidates between converging support and resistance lines. The key characteristics include: Converging Lines: A descending resistance line (lower highs) and an ascending support line (higher lows) squeeze the price into a narrower range. Decreasing Volume: Often, volume tends to decrease as the pattern forms, reflecting indecision in the market. The Breakout: A decisive move, usually accompanied by increased volume, breaking above the resistance line. This is the signal that buyers have regained control. The recent price surge saw BTC push above the upper boundary of this triangle, confirming the crypto breakout . This specific type of triangle is generally considered a ‘continuation pattern,’ meaning that once the breakout occurs, the prior trend (in this case, bullish) is likely to continue. What’s Driving This BTC Analysis and Market Sentiment? According to insights shared by crypto financial services firm Matrixport, this breakout isn’t happening in a vacuum. Several factors seem to be aligning: Renewed Capital Inflows: The technical breakout is often a catalyst, attracting fresh capital back into the market as traders and investors see a clear directional signal. Diminishing External Concerns: Matrixport points to easing concerns over potential tariffs and limited expected impact from upcoming U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data. While CPI is crucial for assessing inflation and potential Federal Reserve actions (which heavily influence risk assets like crypto), the market seems to be pricing in a scenario where the next report won’t derail the current positive sentiment significantly. This combination of positive technical signals and favorable market sentiment is powerful. When the technical picture aligns with the fundamental or sentiment-based analysis, it strengthens the conviction behind the move. Why Key Support Levels Matter for the Bullish Trend In any market, identifying and respecting support levels is critical, especially after a breakout. A support level is a price point or zone where buying interest is strong enough to potentially halt a decline. For the current bullish trend in Bitcoin to remain robust, holding above key support is paramount. While specific numbers can change as the market evolves, analysts are closely watching previous resistance levels that could now act as support. A successful breakout often means the former resistance becomes the new floor. If the price were to fall back below the breakout level and significant support zones, it could signal a ‘fakeout’ and potentially invalidate the bullish view. Therefore, monitoring these levels is a key part of any sound BTC analysis right now. Navigating the Crypto Market: Opportunities and Risks A confirmed crypto breakout like this presents potential opportunities for traders and investors looking to participate in the continuation of the uptrend. However, it’s crucial to approach the market with caution and a clear strategy. Potential Opportunities: Trend Following: Entering positions based on the confirmed bullish signal. Target Identification: Using technical analysis (like measuring the height of the triangle) to project potential price targets. Increased Confidence: The clear technical signal can boost confidence for those already in long positions. Potential Risks: Fakeouts: Breakouts can sometimes fail, with the price quickly reversing back into the pattern or below support. Volatility: The crypto market is inherently volatile, and sharp pullbacks can occur even within a strong uptrend. External Factors: Unexpected macroeconomic news or regulatory developments could still impact sentiment. This is why risk management is non-negotiable. Using stop-loss orders and managing position sizes are essential practices. Actionable Insights for Your Bitcoin Strategy Based on the current BTC analysis and the confirmed breakout, here are some actionable takeaways: Monitor Key Support: Keep a close eye on the price levels that previously acted as resistance and are now expected to provide support. A sustained hold above these levels strengthens the bullish case. Watch Volume: Continued healthy volume on upward moves is a positive sign. Declining volume during rallies or increasing volume on declines could be cautionary signals. Stay Informed on Macro News: While the immediate CPI impact might be limited, future economic data and central bank commentary remain important drivers for the broader crypto market . Plan Your Entry/Exit: If you’re considering entering a position based on this breakout, have a clear plan for your entry point, potential targets, and most importantly, your stop-loss level. Be Mindful of Volatility: Don’t over-leverage. The potential rewards in crypto come with significant risk. Looking Ahead: What Could Drive the Bullish Trend Further? Beyond the immediate technical breakout and current sentiment, several factors could contribute to the continuation of the bullish trend for Bitcoin price : Institutional adoption continues to be a significant narrative. The approval and success of Bitcoin ETFs have opened new avenues for traditional investors to gain exposure. Continued inflows into these products could provide sustained buying pressure. Halving events, while already priced in to some extent, reduce the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market, which historically has been a bullish catalyst over the medium to long term. Global economic conditions and the actions of central banks will continue to play a role. A shift towards more accommodative monetary policies, if it occurs, could increase appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. Technically, traders will be looking for the price to clear subsequent resistance levels on its way up. Each successful break of resistance reinforces the strength of the trend. Summary: Is the Path Clear for Higher Bitcoin Prices? The recent crypto breakout from the bullish triangle is a significant technical development for Bitcoin price . It aligns with positive sentiment indicators like renewed capital inflows and diminishing immediate concerns over macroeconomic data like CPI, as highlighted by Matrixport’s BTC analysis . While the market is always subject to unpredictable events and volatility, the technical picture, supported by underlying sentiment, suggests that the bullish trend has a strong chance of continuing. However, staying vigilant, monitoring key support levels, and employing sound risk management strategies are crucial for navigating the dynamic crypto market . This breakout provides a compelling signal, but the journey upward requires careful observation and informed decision-making.

2025-06-10T17:30:35,"Chainlink Cross-Border Play Expands To Hong Kong–Australia Money Movement","Chainlink is set to play a major role as Hong Kong’s central bank takes a big step in its digital currency tests. Phase two of the e-HKD pilot will try moving tokenized Hong Kong dollars across borders. The plan is to swap e-HKD for A$DC, an Australian dollar stablecoin. This could cut settlement times from days to seconds. It may also show how central banks can work together with blockchain technology. Related Reading: Relentless Bitcoin Accumulation: Strategy Snaps Up 1,045 More BTC Hong Kong And Australia Test Digital Cash According to reports, the project will use Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol, or CCIP, to handle transfers. The goal is simple. Move money in real time and make sure both sides get what they expect. Phase two kicks off with Hong Kong authorities and their counterparts in Australia. They will swap e-HKD for A$DC and aim for instant settlement. Based on reports, this setup could serve as a model for other central banks. We’re excited to share that Chainlink is facilitating the secure exchange of a Hong Kong CBDC and an Australian dollar stablecoin as part of an ongoing use case in Phase 2 of the e-HKD+ Pilot Program. Congratulations to participants @Visa, ANZ, China AMC, and Fidelity… pic.twitter.com/ts2C6Vt4Ul — Chainlink (@chainlink) June 9, 2025 Chainlink Tools In Use Chainlink is not just a name in the mix. It brings two big pieces of tech to the table. CCIP handles the cross-chain messages, acting like a bridge between different blockchains. The Digital Transfer Agent, or DTA, deals with compliance. It keeps track of who owns what token and makes sure rules in different countries are met. In May, World Liberty Financial tapped Chainlink for cross-chain stablecoin transfers covering USD1. That earlier deal hinted at what’s possible this time around. Big Names Join The Pilot Visa and ANZ are helping with payment processing for e-HKD and A$DC. Asset managers Fidelity International and ChinaAMC will also take part. Their job is to manage the tokenized funds on both sides. This mix of banks, asset managers and tech firms shows the project is more than a small test. It has real money and real risks involved. Reports disclosed that those risks are managed by a Payment-versus-Payment model. This means funds are only released when both sides confirm they have received the other asset. Related Reading: Elon Musk ‘Will Do Anything’ To Make XRP King, Tech Mogul Says Market Moves And Reactions LINK, the token for Chainlink, jumped by 6% after news of the pilot broke. It now trades at $14.70. That rise follows a wider market rally driven by hopes that Bitcoin may hit $110,000 before the week’s end. According to market data, crypto traders often chase big targets. Short-term gains can be tempting. But they can also lead to quick sell-offs if the main story fades. Despite the rally, Bitcoin still tracks the equity swings rather closely. There is a mix of bulls and bears in futures data that suggests some people are not yet convinced this run will last. High volatility can shake out weaker hands at the first sign of trouble. A sudden change in risk sentiment or a fresh macro shock can quickly reverse gains.

2025-06-10T17:30:21,"Malaysia’s Crypto Mining Boom Threatened By $100 Million Power Theft","Malaysia’s crypto miners are at a crossroads. A new study by the ACCESS Blockchain Association of Malaysia points to big gains ahead. But it also warns that illegal outfits are draining more than RM441 million from the power grid between 2020 and 2024. That $100 million loss has hit both public safety and investor trust. Malaysia Mining Faces Power Theft Crisis According to national utility Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB), hidden rigs in homes and offices have been tapping into the grid without permission. Over the last five years, TNB logged power losses worth RM441 million. That’s more than $100 million in stolen electricity. Now, grid instability is rising. Local communities risk outages. And real miners worry their bills could spike to cover the shortfall. Legal Mining Growth Could Bring RM700 Million Based on reports from ACCESS , formalizing crypto mining could unlock RM700 million in hardware and infrastructure this year alone. It could also create 4,000 new jobs and boost annual tax revenues by around RM150 million. Malaysia already ranks among the top 10 countries worldwide by bitcoin hash rate share. Cheap industrial tariffs in places like East Sarawak help explain the hike. Yet many legal players stay under the radar. They fear unclear rules and sudden policy shifts. Regulators Urged To Act The study points out that no agency specifically licenses mining. The Securities Commission looks after asset trading and custody, but it stops there. Miners have no dedicated permit. They face vague electricity tariffs and murky environmental rules. That confusion deters investors who want stability. ACCESS calls for a clear mining license, fair pricing, and defined environmental checks. In neighboring Thailand and Indonesia, illegal mining has also spiked. Between 2018 and 2024, power-theft incidents tied to crypto rigs jumped nearly 300%, totaling nearly 2,400 cases. That regional trend underlines a shared headache. If Malaysia doesn’t tighten laws, it risks losing credibility in the fast-growing digital asset arena. TNB has started using smart meters and data analytics to spot theft early. But enforcement remains patchy. Multiple government bodies share responsibility, which means cases often slip through the cracks. Without a unified team on this, illegal operators keep hitting the grid—and the public. ACCESS suggests updating landlord liability laws so building owners can’t turn a blind eye to unauthorized rigs. It also recommends energy pricing tied to sustainability, nudging miners toward greener power.

Bitcoin's 11.1% climb in May, outpaced gold and broke through key resistance levels, said ARK. Gains also coincided with clear signs of stress in the housing and auto sectors, traditionally seen as pillars of U.S. consumer strength. In housing, the number of sellers has far outpaced buyers, a trend ARK links to the Federal Reserve’s steep rate hikes since 2022. With affordability deteriorating, pressure is mounting on prices in what remains the largest source of household net worth. Meanwhile, auto sales, which surged earlier this year in anticipation of tariffs, collapsed in May — falling to 15.6 million units from above 17 million just a month prior. As these markets soften, bitcoin appears to be catching some of the capital looking for yield and resilience, ARK noted. Spot bitcoin ETFs drew $5.5 billion in May — more than triple the inflows seen in gold ETFs, which dropped sharply during the same period.

2025-06-10T17:15:56,"Siebert Financial to Raise $100M to Fuel Crypto and AI Growth Plan","Siebert Financial Corp., a well-known financial services company, is set to raise a massive $100 million to fund its crypto investments. On Monday, the company revealed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved its S-3 shelf registration. This approval allows the Nasdaq-listed firm to invest the money raised in cryptocurrencies, artificial intelligence (AI), and possible new business acquisitions. This decision comes as many public companies increasingly invest in digital assets and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology. Siebert Financial To Invest in Digital Assets and Technology Siebert clarified that this fundraising effort is part of a bigger plan. The firm wants to expand its technology capabilities and strengthen its position in digital finance. John Gebbia, Siebert’s CEO, called the shelf registration a foundational step for growing the company’s technology strategy. Siebert plans to invest some of the funds in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). These digital assets have become more popular among companies looking to diversify their holdings and tap into the potential of blockchain technology . The company will also explore using AI-powered services to improve its operations and client service. Siebert’s Move Signals Strategy for Long-Term Growth Siebert’s leaders see this capital raise as essential to their long-term growth plan. For context, a shelf registration, like the S-3 type, is designed to allow a company to sell stocks or bonds over time when market conditions are favorable. With approval from the SEC, Siebert can move quickly when new opportunities arise. This will enable the Nasdaq-listed firm to explore fast-growing innovative sectors, including AI and blockchain technology. In addition, the approval also gives Siebert the advantage of not having to raise the full $100 million at once. The firm can offer smaller amounts based on its needs and market trends. Using an S-3 shelf registration, Siebert focuses on growth and innovation as it moves into new areas like crypto and AI. Siebert Follows a Bigger Trend in Corporate Crypto Adoption Siebert’s move is not insolation. Many other companies are increasing their investments in cryptocurrencies. Strategy, led by popular Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, remains the largest public holder of Bitcoin. On the same day as Siebert’s announcement, Strategy disclosed it had bought another 1,045 BTC for about $110.2 million. This brings its total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 582,000 BTC. Other firms are also making moves. Trump Media, GameStop, and research firm K33 have all revealed plans to increase their Bitcoin holdings. Meanwhile, Japan’s Metaplanet recently launched a $5.4 billion equity offering to buy even more Bitcoin.

Price Analysis","Plenty of price fluctuations are sending Bitcoin this way and that, but Ethereum (ETH) appears to be holding its own. With $BTC in the red, along with a good part of the altcoins, $ETH is up on the day and threatening to break through the $2,700 major resistance. Is $ETH about to break much higher, or is another rejection in the offing? ETH/USD at critical juncture Source: TradingView Going straight into the higher time frame for $ETH it can be seen that the number 2 cryptocurrency by market capitalization is at a critical juncture. The price has been in a range during the last few weeks and is right at the top of this currently. If the bulls can tip the price over and into the horizontal resistance band that stretches from $2,750 up to $2,900, the $ETH price could have the chance to consolidate here; perhaps moving sideways for a period until shorter-term time frame Stochastic RSIs can reset. $ETH confirms breakout against $BTC pair Source: TradingView The 4-hour time frame for ETH/BTC reveals that $ETH has just penetrated the descending trendline, has come back to test it, and is now consolidating above. A higher high has been made, although out in the higher time frame of the weekly, the Stochastic RSI indicators have reached the top, meaning that there could be a longer period of consolidation to come. Huge task confronts $ETH bulls against $BTC Source: TradingView Zooming out into that weekly time frame for ETH/BTC the sheer size of the task confronting the $ETH bulls becomes apparent. While $ETH is up 40% against its $BTC pair recently, this is still a drop in the ocean compared to what needs to be done. It can be noted just how strong the current horizontal resistance level is. However, the bulls have to start somewhere and if this level can be overcome, the next resistance is at 0.03 BTC. The $ETH bulls will need all the luck they can get.

2025-06-10T17:05:23,"Ethena price forms Double Bottom as accumulation zone holds firm","Ethena is showing early signs of a bullish reversal as price action begins to mirror previous accumulation phases. A potential double bottom is forming at key support, and a breakout above the $0.50 resistance level could confirm the start of a new upward rotation toward higher time frame Fibonacci targets. The current market structure on Ethena ( ENA ) suggests the asset is trading in an accumulation phase, supported by both technical indicators and fractal similarities to prior price action. Price has returned to a historically significant zone, where a rounded bottom is forming. This area previously acted as the base for a major bullish expansion and may now be setting the stage for a similar move. Key technical points Double Bottom Formation in Progress: Price action is forming a clear double bottom pattern, often a precursor to trend reversals. $0.50 Resistance Is Key: A break above this high-timeframe level could confirm bullish intent and open the path toward higher resistance. Accumulation Range Intact: Ethena continues to trade in a sideways structure between key support and resistance levels. ENAUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingVIew From a technical and structural standpoint, Ethena is working through a prolonged consolidation period. Price is trading within a clearly defined accumulation range, positioned between strong support and resistance zones. The current setup mirrors a previous bottoming pattern where price coiled before a decisive breakout. A double bottom pattern is developing, characterized by two rounded lows and a neckline around the $0.50 region. This level represents the final barrier before confirming the reversal structure. If price breaks above $0.50 with strong volume and follow-through, it would validate the bullish thesis and could drive a move toward the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement from the broader downtrend.

What to expect in the coming price action If Ethena breaks and holds above the $0.50 resistance level, it would confirm the double bottom and likely spark a rally toward the next major target near the 0.618 Fibonacci level.

Shiba Inu joined a broader market bullish trend yesterday, continuing its recovery phase. Notably, the second-largest meme coin by market capitalization is up 3% since the start of the week and is on track for its first positive price action in five weeks.Shiba Inu to $150 Billion Market Cap?Meanwhile, data from IntoTheBlock shows a moderate correlation between Shiba Inu and the broader crypto market. For context, with SHIB, Bitcoin has a correlation coefficient of 0.61, Ethereum has 0.57, and Dogecoin has a higher 0.86 over the past sixty days. Shiba Inu Price Correlation with the Crypto Market Shiba Inu Price Correlation with the Crypto Market | IntoTheBlock This suggests that Shiba Inu would mirror a broader bullish market trend. Hence, with institutional interest entering the cryptocurrency market, analysts predict that major cryptocurrencies will rally extensively, which could potentially push Shiba Inu to a $150 billion market cap.Also, the development of the Shiba Inu ecosystem further fuels this optimism. Recent technological deployments and a strategic partnership with the United Arab Emirates' Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure (MoEI) have raised confidence that Shiba Inu will defy current bearish trends and potentially reach a market cap of $150 billion.Shiba Inu’s Price at $150 Billion Market CapAccording to the current rankings, it is the 19th-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, with a valuation of $7.65 billion. Notably, if this figure rallies to $150 billion, it will surpass the $45 billion peak valuation in October 2021.Currently, Shiba Inu has a total supply of 589.5 trillion SHIB. As a result, a $150 billion cap would push prices to $0.000254, representing a staggering 1,856% upsurge from the current prices. It would also see the meme coin surpass its current all-time high of $0.00008845.Is a Rally to $0.000254 Possible?Considering Shiba Inu’s current trajectory, a 1,856% surge to $0.000254 seems ambitious. Achieving the price mark would ensure it chalks off one more zero, pushing prices on course for new heights, such as $0.01.Notwithstanding, analysis suggests this is possible. Market watcher More Crypto Online highlighted in an earlier commentary that Shiba Inu could rally to between $0.0001 and $0.0002, citing a bullish Elliot Wave formation.Moreover, Changelly also projected the price mark for Shiba Inu, specifically suggesting it would happen by May 2032.

2025-06-10T16:57:40,"QFSCOIN Best Free Crypto Cloud Mining Provider Launches Most Profitable Bitcoin Mining Service in 2025","Dogecoin (DOGE) is making news again, but not only due of memes and social media buzz. Recent on-chain data shows that the whales, who are the largest investors in the market, are discreetly buying up DOGE. This consistent purchasing suggests that something major may happen soon, and it’s a chance for regular investors to be ready and move ahead of the next breakout. If you want to ride this wave but don’t want to deal with the trouble or expense of purchasing and taking care of mining equipment, QFSCOIN’s cloud mining platform is the right answer. You can mine Dogecoin, Bitcoin, and Litecoin easily and without any hardware. Plus, you get paid every day. It’s time to start mining DOGE and get ready for what’s coming. What On-Chain Data Tells Us About Dogecoin Whales In the realm of cryptocurrency, whales are people or organizations that own a lot of coins. Following their actions may frequently provide you hints about how prices will change in the future. Blockchain study suggests that whale activity is going up for Dogecoin. These big holders have been continuously adding to their DOGE reserves over the last several weeks. This shows that they are confident and might be an indication of a price rise. When whales gather coins, it typically signifies that the market thinks demand will go up or that something good is about to happen. This may make the supply tighter and raise prices, which gives miners and investors a chance to break out. Prices typically go up a lot by the time most people find out about them. Why Mine Dogecoin Now With QFSCOIN? Mining is another option to get coins instead than purchasing DOGE directly on exchanges, which may be expensive during price spikes. With QFSCOIN, anyone can mine Dogecoin without having to buy costly rigs or set up intricate systems.

Plus, all contracts come with daily payouts, so your profits compound quickly as the DOGE market gains momentum. Why Act Now Before Mining Becomes More Expensive? Whale accumulation tends to drive demand higher, which can lead to increased mining difficulty and costs over time. This means waiting too long could make it harder and more costly to mine Dogecoin profitably. QFSCOIN’s cloud mining service removes the usual barriers: no worries about electricity bills, cooling costs, or hardware failures.

2025-06-10T16:57:19,"Trump-backed American Bitcoin firm buys $23m worth of Bitcoin ahead of merger","American Bitcoin, a mining firm backed by Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., has accumulated 215 Bitcoin, worth nearly $24 million, since launching operations on April 1, according to a June 6 SEC filing. The company, known formally as ABTC, intends to go public later this year through a stock-for-stock merger with Gryphon Digital Mining. The filing outlines ABTC’s unconventional approach: Bitcoin ( BTC ) ownership isn’t a byproduct of mining—it is the business. The firm describes its strategy as “layered,” focusing on producing Bitcoin below market cost, leveraging capital to expand its treasury, and participating actively in the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. Unlike traditional miners that build and operate their own infrastructure, ABTC contracts out its mining operations. Notably, the firm’s 215 BTC reserve—held securely with Coinbase Custody—is part of an open-ended strategy. ABTC said it plans to increase its holdings over time, depending on market conditions and capital availability. This approach echoes Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin treasury strategy at MicroStrategy, which has influenced a number of corporate accumulators. You might also like: Will Bitcoin continue rising?

2025-06-10T16:50:15,"Bitcoin Acquisition: The Smarter Web Company Expands Strategic BTC Holding","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Acquisition: The Smarter Web Company Expands Strategic BTC Holding In a move signaling continued confidence in the digital asset space, UK-based web development firm, The Smarter Web Company (SWC), recently announced a significant expansion of its BTC holding . This latest Bitcoin acquisition adds another layer to the growing trend of companies integrating cryptocurrency into their treasury management and long-term investment plans. Why Companies Are Embracing a Corporate Bitcoin Strategy The news from The Smarter Web Company isn’t happening in a vacuum. Across the globe, businesses are exploring and adopting a corporate Bitcoin strategy . But why are traditional companies, especially those outside the financial sector, deciding to hold a volatile asset like Bitcoin? Several factors are driving this trend: Inflation Hedge: With global economic uncertainties and rising inflation concerns, many companies view Bitcoin as a potential store of value, similar to digital gold. Its fixed supply is often cited as a key characteristic that could preserve purchasing power over the long term. Potential for Appreciation: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has historically shown significant long-term price appreciation. Companies allocating a portion of their treasury to BTC are often doing so with the expectation of capital growth. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate balance sheet can provide diversification away from traditional assets like cash and bonds, which may yield low returns in the current economic climate. Forward-Thinking & Innovation: Embracing digital assets can position a company as innovative and forward-thinking, potentially attracting talent and investors interested in the future of finance and technology. Liquidity: Bitcoin is a highly liquid asset, easily traded on numerous global exchanges, offering flexibility should the company need to access funds. While the risks are real – primarily price volatility and regulatory uncertainty – the potential benefits are increasingly compelling for companies like The Smarter Web Company. The Smarter Web Company’s Strategic BTC Holding: A Closer Look The core announcement from SWC detailed the purchase of an additional 45.32 BTC. This wasn’t a spur-of-the-moment decision but a deliberate action within their established framework. According to their announcement on X (formerly Twitter), this purchase is a part of their broader, long-term digital asset strategy , specifically referred to as “The 10 Year Plan.” This latest acquisition significantly boosts their total BTC holding . Before this purchase, SWC held a certain amount of Bitcoin. Adding 45.32 BTC brings their total holdings to 168.08 BTC. To put this in perspective, let’s look at the change: Metric Before Acquisition Latest Acquisition After Acquisition BTC Acquired N/A 45.32 BTC N/A Total BTC Holding 168.08 – 45.32 = 122.76 BTC N/A 168.08 BTC This increase represents a substantial percentage jump in their overall Bitcoin reserves, demonstrating a clear commitment to their stated strategy over the long haul. Understanding ‘The 10 Year Plan’ and Digital Asset Strategy Referring to their approach as “The 10 Year Plan” is significant. It explicitly signals that The Smarter Web Company views this digital asset strategy not as a short-term trade or speculation, but as a foundational element of their long-term financial planning. A decade-long horizon suggests they are looking past immediate market fluctuations and are focused on the potential value and utility of Bitcoin over a considerable period. What might a corporate digital asset strategy like this entail over 10 years? It could involve: Phased Accumulation: Like SWC’s recent purchase, the plan likely involves periodic acquisitions, potentially timed based on market conditions or company cash flow. Secure Storage: Implementing robust security measures (like multi-signature cold storage) to protect their significant BTC holding from theft or loss. Accounting and Reporting: Navigating the complexities of accounting for cryptocurrency holdings on their balance sheet according to relevant standards. Risk Management: Developing strategies to mitigate risks associated with price volatility, regulatory changes, and technological advancements. Potential Future Use Cases: While primarily a treasury asset now, the plan might eventually explore using Bitcoin for payments, investments, or other corporate activities as the ecosystem matures. Education and Integration: Ensuring internal teams understand digital assets and integrating this strategy into the company’s overall financial and business operations. This long-term perspective is crucial. It contrasts sharply with short-term trading approaches and aligns more with traditional corporate investment philosophies focused on enduring value. The Smarter Web Company in the Context of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption While companies like MicroStrategy are famous for their massive Bitcoin reserves, accumulating tens of thousands of BTC, SWC’s holding of 168.08 BTC is still noteworthy, especially for a UK-based web development firm. It places them among a growing list of smaller to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that are quietly adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. This trend among SMEs is arguably as important as the large-scale acquisitions by giants. It indicates broader acceptance and integration of digital assets into the mainstream economy. It suggests that the rationale for holding Bitcoin is resonating not just with tech giants but also with established businesses across various sectors. The fact that The Smarter Web Company, a web development firm, is pursuing this strategy is particularly interesting. It highlights the interconnectedness of the tech world and the digital asset space. Web development companies are often at the forefront of adopting new technologies, and their embrace of Bitcoin as a treasury asset could influence other businesses in the tech sector and beyond. Challenges and Considerations for a Corporate Bitcoin Strategy While the benefits are attractive, implementing a corporate Bitcoin strategy comes with challenges. Companies must carefully consider: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience significant swings, which can impact the reported value of the company’s holdings and potentially affect shareholder perception. Regulatory Environment: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving in the UK and globally. Changes could impact how companies hold, manage, or use their Bitcoin. Security Risks: Holding digital assets requires sophisticated security protocols to prevent hacking or loss of private keys. Accounting and Tax: The accounting treatment and tax implications of holding and transacting with Bitcoin can be complex and vary by jurisdiction. Public Perception: Some stakeholders may view holding Bitcoin as risky or speculative, requiring clear communication from the company about its strategy and rationale. The Smarter Web Company, by explicitly stating their “10 Year Plan,” is likely aiming to address some of these concerns by emphasizing the long-term, strategic nature of their digital asset strategy . Actionable Insights for Businesses and Investors The Smarter Web Company’s move offers insights for both other businesses considering digital assets and individual investors: For Businesses: If you’re considering a corporate Bitcoin strategy , start by understanding your objectives (e.g., inflation hedge, growth). Develop a clear, long-term plan like SWC’s. Consult with legal, financial, and security experts familiar with digital assets. Begin with a small allocation you are comfortable with. For Investors: Corporate adoption by companies like SWC is a bullish signal for the long-term growth and acceptance of Bitcoin. Pay attention to companies that are transparent about their BTC holding and digital asset strategy , as this can be an indicator of their forward-thinking approach. Understand that even corporations view Bitcoin as a long-term play, reinforcing the idea of holding through volatility. The increasing number of companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets validates the asset class and contributes to its maturation. Each new Bitcoin acquisition by a company, whether large or small, builds confidence and infrastructure around corporate digital asset management. Conclusion: A Strategic Step in the Digital Asset Journey The Smarter Web Company’s recent Bitcoin acquisition is more than just a transaction; it’s a reinforcement of their commitment to a long-term digital asset strategy . By increasing their BTC holding to 168.08 BTC as part of “The 10 Year Plan,” they are signaling confidence in Bitcoin’s role as a future treasury asset and store of value. This move by a UK-based web development firm underscores the broadening appeal of Bitcoin beyond early adopters and financial institutions. It highlights the strategic thinking required for companies navigating the evolving financial landscape, where digital assets are becoming increasingly relevant.

2025-06-10T16:46:09,"Negative Rates Return to Switzerland as U.S. Faces Higher Yields. What Does it Mean for Bitcoin?","As President Donald Trump's trade war threatens to upend the global economy, an interesting divergence has emerged that could potentially grease the bitcoin BTC bull run. The divergence in consideration is the elevated yields on U.S. Treasury notes that threaten to compound the fiscal issues, and the renewed negative flip in yields on Swiss government bonds. According to data source Investing.com, Swiss government bonds with maturities of up to five years offered negative yields at press time, with the two-year yield at -17.8 basis points. On the contrary, similar-duration Treasury notes offered yields over 4%. The divergence is the bond market's way of telling us that the trade war will have different impacts on various countries, depending on their trade profiles. Those running trade surpluses, such as several European countries and China, will face disinflation or an outright deflation, while countries like the U.S., which import more than they export, will see an increase in price pressures. The specter of deflation in European nations and China could put pressure on their central banks to ease monetary policy aggressively, likely leading to increased capital deployment into alternative investments like bitcoin. Both the Swiss National Bank and the European Central Bank have already cut rates in recent months. Meanwhile, analysts have said that higher yields in the U.S. and the record public debt could accelerate the shift away from U.S. assets and into alternative assets. ""The last time this happened [Swiss yields turned negative in late 2019], it preceded coordinated global easing, repo market seizures, and ultimately pandemic-era QE. Now, it likely reflects a mix of deflationary pressure, eurozone contagion risks, and capital rotating into monetary sovereignty safe havens amid sovereign stress elsewhere,"" pseudonymous analyst EndGame Macro said on X. It's worth noting that bitcoin's 2020-2021 bull run from $5,000 to over $60,000 was characterized by a record amount of negative-yielding government debt worldwide.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/11/negative-rates-are-back-in-switzerland-as-u-s-faces-higher-bond-yields-what-does-it-mean-for-bitcoin,"ASIA|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Switzerland|United States|Bonds|News",cryptocompare

2025-06-10T16:40:10,"Exciting Cardano Bitcoin DeFi Launch: Cardinal Protocol Bridges ADA and BTC","BitcoinWorld Exciting Cardano Bitcoin DeFi Launch: Cardinal Protocol Bridges ADA and BTC The world of decentralized finance (DeFi) is constantly evolving, seeking ways to connect disparate blockchain ecosystems. A significant step in this direction has just been announced, potentially unlocking new possibilities for two of the largest cryptocurrencies. Are you ready to see Cardano Bitcoin DeFi become a reality? What is the Cardinal Protocol? Bridging ADA and BTC Breaking news from the Cardano ecosystem! Charles Hoskinson, the visionary founder of Cardano (ADA), has officially announced the launch of the Cardinal Protocol . This isn’t just any new application; it’s being hailed as the very first Bitcoin (BTC) decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built directly on the Cardano network. This development, initially highlighted by Wu Blockchain, signifies a major leap in cross-chain interoperability, specifically between the Bitcoin and Cardano blockchains. At its core, the Cardinal Protocol aims to bring Bitcoin’s massive liquidity and user base into the burgeoning Cardano DeFi landscape. Historically, accessing Bitcoin within other DeFi ecosystems required wrapped tokens or centralized services, adding layers of complexity and custodial risk. Cardinal seeks to change this paradigm. How Does Cardinal Enable Bitcoin DeFi on Cardano? The magic behind Cardinal’s ability to bridge these two distinct networks lies in its technical foundation. The protocol leverages advanced cryptography, specifically MuSig2 multi-signature technology . This is a crucial element because it allows Cardinal to interact with Bitcoin’s native structure – the unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) – in a secure and non-custodial manner. Let’s break down the key mechanisms: MuSig2 Multi-Signature: This technology allows multiple parties to collaborate on signing a single transaction in a way that appears as a standard single-signature transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain. For Cardinal, this enables the creation of multi-sig wallets where users retain control of their keys, even when their BTC is being utilized within the Cardano DeFi environment. Non-Custodial Functionality: A cornerstone of true DeFi. Cardinal is designed so that users never lose direct control over their underlying BTC assets. The MuSig2 setup ensures that the user is always one of the required signers for any movement of their Bitcoin UTXOs. This dramatically reduces counterparty risk compared to custodial wrapping services. Direct UTXO Interaction: Instead of relying on wrapped BTC tokens (like wBTC), Cardinal interacts directly with Bitcoin’s native UTXO model. This is a more direct and potentially more secure way to represent Bitcoin value on another chain. This technical approach facilitates genuine Cross-chain BTC usability within Cardano’s smart contract platform. What Can You Do with Bitcoin on Cardinal? The primary use cases announced for Cardinal revolve around core DeFi activities: 1. Lending: Users can deposit their native BTC (via the Cardinal protocol’s non-custodial mechanism) and potentially borrow assets on the Cardano network. This unlocks the significant value held in Bitcoin for use within Cardano’s DeFi protocols without needing to sell the BTC. 2. Staking/Yield Generation: While ‘staking’ in the traditional Proof-of-Stake sense doesn’t apply directly to Bitcoin, Cardinal enables users to lock their BTC via the protocol to participate in yield-generating opportunities available on Cardano. This could involve providing liquidity to trading pools or other DeFi strategies, earning returns on their Bitcoin holdings. 3. Ordinals Support: In a nod to the growing interest in Bitcoin-based digital artifacts, Cardinal also supports the use of BTC Ordinals inscriptions as collateral within the protocol. This expands the types of assets that can be leveraged for DeFi activities on Cardano, bringing a new dimension to the platform. This functionality essentially creates a secure and decentralized ADA BTC bridge , allowing value and utility to flow between the two ecosystems. Why is Bitcoin DeFi on Cardano Significant? The launch of the Cardinal Protocol represents a major milestone for several reasons: Increased Interoperability: It directly addresses the long-standing challenge of connecting Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, with other smart contract platforms like Cardano. Unlocking Bitcoin Liquidity: Billions of dollars are held in inactive Bitcoin wallets. Cardinal provides a pathway to utilize this capital within DeFi without requiring users to sell their BTC or trust centralized custodians. Growth for Cardano’s DeFi Ecosystem: By attracting Bitcoin users and liquidity, Cardinal can significantly boost the total value locked (TVL) and activity on Cardano’s DeFi protocols. True Non-Custodial Approach: The reliance on MuSig2 and direct UTXO interaction offers a potentially more decentralized and secure method for cross-chain interaction compared to wrapped tokens. Innovation in Cross-chain BTC: It pushes the boundaries of how native Bitcoin can be used in external DeFi environments. Potential Challenges and the Road Ahead While the launch is exciting, it’s important to consider the potential challenges: Adoption: Will Bitcoin holders be comfortable using a new protocol on Cardano? Education and ease of use will be key. Security Audits: As with any new DeFi protocol, especially one handling cross-chain interactions and significant value, rigorous security audits are paramount. Scalability: How will the protocol scale if large amounts of Bitcoin liquidity flow in? Integration with Existing Cardano DeFi: Seamless integration with existing lending protocols, DEXs, and yield farms on Cardano will be necessary for widespread adoption. The success of Cardinal will depend on its ability to overcome these hurdles and demonstrate reliable, secure functionality. Getting Involved: Actionable Insights For users interested in exploring Bitcoin DeFi on Cardano via Cardinal: Stay Informed: Follow official announcements from the Cardinal team and Cardano ecosystem updates. Understand the Risks: DeFi carries inherent risks, including smart contract vulnerabilities and market volatility. Cross-chain interactions can add complexity. Do your own research (DYOR). Start Small: If you decide to participate, consider starting with a small amount of BTC to understand how the protocol works before committing larger sums. Wallet Compatibility: Ensure you are using a Cardano wallet that supports interaction with the Cardinal protocol. The launch marks the beginning of a new chapter for the ADA BTC bridge narrative. Summary: A New Era for Cardano and Bitcoin The launch of the Cardinal Protocol is a landmark event, bringing native, non-custodial Cardano Bitcoin DeFi to life. By utilizing MuSig2 technology to interact directly with Bitcoin UTXOs and even support Ordinals, Cardinal creates a novel Cross-chain BTC solution on the Cardano network. This initiative has the potential to unlock significant Bitcoin liquidity, fuel the growth of DeFi on Cardano, and establish a robust ADA BTC bridge . While challenges remain, the Cardinal Protocol represents an exciting step towards a more interconnected and capital-efficient decentralized future for both ecosystems.

2025-06-10T16:35:45,"Decentralized Casinos: The Future of Online Gambling","BitcoinWorld Decentralized Casinos: The Future of Online Gambling The gambling world has come a long way, from smoky physical casinos to online platforms, and now, it’s stepping into the future with decentralized casinos. These platforms promise to disrupt the industry by combining technology, finance, and gambling into a seamless experience. In this text, we’ll break down what a decentralized Bitcoin casino is, how it works, and why it might be the future – if the blockchain doesn’t explode in the process. Maybe traditional platforms are better. Of course, we’ll also look at the risks and challenges that come with the shiny new tech. While the road ahead might not be entirely smooth, with transparency and autonomy on the line, the potential is hard to ignore. Let’s dive into the mechanics of this emerging trend. Decentralized Casinos: The Basics Decentralized casinos powered by blockchain technology are here to revolutionize online gambling because, clearly, the traditional online casino experience just wasn’t cutting it. Forget depositing your funds into an account controlled by a platform. In decentralized casinos, you maintain control of your money, thanks to the magic of smart contracts and blockchain. This cutting-edge tech promises security, transparency, and a complete lack of middlemen. Blockchain, first made famous by Bitcoin in 2009 , is the technology that ensures these casinos run without central authorities. It’s all about distributed records across computers, making sure no one can tamper with the games—or your funds. You get to play and win without a casino boss in sight. Characteristic Description Blockchain-powered Blockchain removes the need for intermediaries by distributing transaction records across a network of computers. Thank you, Bitcoin. Smart Contracts No middlemen! Smart contracts automate game fairness, executing terms directly in code. Ethereum gave this the green light for decentralized everything, including gambling. User Control You control your funds, not the casino. Cryptocurrencies ensure you’re the boss of your own wallet. Transparency Every transaction is on the blockchain for the world to see. No hidden tricks here, just cold, hard transparency. The best part? Transparency. All bets, outcomes, and transactions are recorded on the blockchain, making it impossible for shady business to sneak in. Unlike traditional casinos, there’s no way for the house to rig the game when the results are publicly available for verification. Too much for house edge. In this new world of gambling, you’re not trusting an online platform with your funds—you’re trusting an unbreakable blockchain and smart contracts that run the show. It’s a fresh new take on a century-old industry, and while not perfect, it’s certainly aiming to make the casino world a lot more fun, and a lot more secure. What’s next, decentralized slot machines? Oh wait, that’s already a thing! Why Decentralized Casinos Are Gaining Momentum Decentralized casinos aren’t just the latest trend—they’re practically a breath of fresh air compared to traditional casinos. They promise better security, fewer restrictions, and lower fees, all while giving players more control. Here’s a comparison of why decentralized casinos might just be the future of online gambling: Advantage Decentralized Casinos Traditional Casinos Increased Security Blockchain makes it almost impossible for hackers to alter or steal funds. Traditional casinos? Well, they can still be hacked. Anonymity No need for personal info—just play and win in peace. Traditional casinos love asking for your ID. Global Access Anyone, anywhere can play, no borders, no issues. Restricted by geography and local regulations. Low Fees Lower transaction fees, no middlemen eating your funds. Expect hefty fees due to operational costs. Decentralization No central authority controlling you or your money. The house always has the final say—and it’s not always in your favor. Security? Decentralized casinos have it covered, while traditional ones are still vulnerable to breaches. Cryptocurrency transactions ensure extra protection, and anonymity lets you play without a background check. Plus, global access means you can gamble from anywhere, unlike the regional restrictions in traditional casinos. And don’t even get me started on fees – decentralized casinos win there, too. Finally, decentralization means no shady “house” influences—just smart contracts running the show, ensuring fairness. So, yes, decentralized casinos may just have the upper hand. You know, if you’re into security, low fees, and complete control. The Dark Side of Decentralized Casinos Ah, decentralized casinos – where everything is perfect… except for a few small details. Sure, they offer enhanced security and transparency, but let’s not get carried away. There are still a few risks and challenges that could make even the most confident gambler pause for a second. Challenge Risk Lack of Regulation Without regulation, these casinos can be a playgrounds for malicious activities. Volatility of Cryptocurrency Cryptocurrency’s price swings might make your winnings disappear faster than you can say “Bitcoin.” Technical Barriers Not everyone is a blockchain expert, and that could limit who can actually play. Scams and Fraud No regulation means more room for shady schemes to sneak in. One of the biggest drawbacks is the lack of regulation. While Bitz, the trusty traditional online casino, plays by the rules, decentralized casinos operate in the wild west, where fraud and illegal activities can thrive without oversight. And let’s not forget the volatility of cryptocurrencies—one minute you’re up, the next, your Bitcoin has tanked. As for technical barriers, not everyone has the time or energy to become a blockchain expert, and this could keep some players from even bothering. Finally, the lack of oversight opens the door for scams and fraud, making decentralized casinos feel like a game of chance—where the house might not even be the biggest problem. While the promise is great, let’s not forget the road bumps on the way to a decentralized gambling utopia. Conclusion Decentralized casinos are the next big thing, offering security, transparency, and total freedom. Sure, there are a few minor issues like cryptocurrency volatility and lack of regulation. If you’re ready to risk it all, decentralized casinos might just be the future. Or, you know, a bold experiment. Are you feeling lucky enough to gamble on the future of gambling?

2025-06-10T16:35:43,"US Bitcoin Investors Are Buying Again: What Does This Mean for BTC’s Price?","The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a surge in bitcoin (BTC) purchases from investors in the United States. This is a positive occurrence for the sector and could drive a sustained rally in bitcoin’s price. According to a report from the market intelligence platform CryptoQuant, the Coinbase Premium index, which measures U.S. buyer appetite, has reached its highest level in over three months. U.S. Investors Are Buying BTC CryptoQuant analyst Dan revealed that the market has been in an upward trend for eight weeks, starting from mid-April. The surge in the Coinbase Premium shows that buying pressure from Bitcoin investors in the U.S. is supporting the uptrend. Bitcoin’s movement has shown no signs of overheating. Dan says this is a typical sign often seen in rising cycles following corrections. This suggests that the crypto market will see optimistic movements as the bull cycle progresses in the second half of the year. The increased buying pressure from U.S. investors is evident in the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) market. Data from CoinGlass shows that six of the eleven U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded inflows that totaled $386.2 million during trading hours on Monday. The positive flows came after two consecutive days of outflows on Thursday and Friday last week. Besides the positive ETF flows, another sign that buyers are dominating again is the Bitcoin Spot 90-day Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) flashing green for the first time in four months. This metric measures market dominance between buyers and sellers. A separate CryptoQuant analysis disclosed that CVD turning green after a prolonged period in red could mark the start of a new bullish move. New Whales Acquire BTC at Record Pace Furthermore, CryptoQuant discovered that Bitcoin whales have been buying at an increased rate. A filter that isolated new whales from long-dormant cold investors found that a fresh cohort has been stacking BTC at a record pace. This cohort holds ≥ 1,000 BTC with an average coin age of less than six months. Between March 1 and June 4, the holdings of this group of whales doubled, from approximately 500,000 BTC to around 1.1 million BTC. This shows an increase of at least 600,000 BTC worth roughly $63 billion. Additionally, their supply share has climbed from 2.5% to 5.6% of the total BTC circulating supply – this is equivalent to approximately ten months of mining output removed from circulation.

2025-06-10T16:32:07,"Crypto Mining Company Riot Platforms Announces Its Latest Bitcoin Sales Amount! Here Are the Figures in the Mining Industry","There were significant developments in the crypto mining sector throughout May. From the US to Russia, strategic moves and new hardware launches of major players were among the notable headlines in the sector. Riot Platforms Launches First Major BTC Sale of the Year US-based crypto mining company Riot Platforms announced that it sold 475 Bitcoin in April, marking the company’s first major BTC sale since January 2024. Riot tended to hold onto the BTC it had previously produced with a HODL strategy. It is thought that the sale may have been made for operational expenses or to raise funds for new investments. The American Bitcoin company, backed by US President Donald Trump, has accelerated its plans to go public. The company will carry out the IPO process by merging with Gryphon Digital Mining. The merger in question shows that the trend of IPOs via SPAC (special purpose acquisition company) continues in the sector. The Russian government has proposed imposing a value added tax (VAT) on domestic companies that lease mining equipment or provide hashrate (mining power) services to foreign customers. The move aims to regulate international mining operations and increase tax revenues. Mining hardware giant Bitmain has launched a new ASIC mining device offering 9.5 J/TH efficiency. This device, which stands out with its low energy consumption, is especially attractive to large-scale mining farms looking to reduce energy costs. Details regarding the sale of the device will be shared in the coming weeks. These developments in the mining industry show that both political support and technological innovations continue to shape the sector. Energy efficiency-focused devices and public offering strategies indicate that the sector is evolving towards a more corporate and transparent structure. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-10T16:12:07,"Ether More Favored by Traders as Volatility Against Bitcoin Hits Highest Since FTX Crash","Ethereum's ether ETH token, which has been in the shadows of bitcoin BTC for a long time, is now becoming the new favorite. Data from TradingView shows that the spread between Volmex's annualized 30-day ether implied volatility index (EVIV) and bitcoin's 30-day index (BVIV) has jumped to 34%, the highest since November 2022. Back then, the FTX exchange went bust, destroying billions in investor wealth. The widening spread indicates that the market expects significantly larger price swings for ether, and perhaps the broader crypto market, compared to bitcoin in the coming weeks. Ether has recently outshone bitcoin in terms of price gains, largely due to renewed institutional interest in the cryptocurrency. Notably, in the past 24 hours, ether has risen 8% to $2,728, outperforming almost every major cryptocurrency, including market leader bitcoin, which has gained just 1%, CoinDesk data show. ""Ethereum is pumping up with new money. Over the past two weeks, Ethereum ETFs have attracted $812 million, the biggest amount since the beginning of this year,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at The FxPro said in an email. While inflows into the ether spot ETFs have picked up pace, BTC ETFs have managed to draw in less than $400 million in the past two weeks, according to data source SoSoValue. According to the Singapore-based trading firm QCP, several factors have aligned in favor of the ether bulls. ""Looking ahead, macro tailwinds are aligning for ETH. With the GENIUS Act advancing in the US Senate, Circle’s IPO discussions resurfacing, and stablecoins gaining regulatory traction, Ethereum’s native role in tokenization and settlement rails may be primed for outsized structural upside,"" QCP said in a market update. The bias for ether is also evident from the fact that on options exchange Deribit, ETH call options are trading at a premium of at least 2% to 3% relative to puts out to the March 2027 expiry. On the contrary, BTC calls are trading at 0.5%-1.5% premium, according to data source Amberdata. In other words, traders are paying more for the upside exposure in ether compared to bitcoin. ""ETH options markets have surged with 30-day call-skew hitting 6.24% and funding rates spiking to 0.009%, while the term structure of volatility has reinverted once more,"" analytics firm Block Scholes said in its daily report.

At this point, BTC, which fell to the level of $ 100,000 a few days ago, rose above $ 110,000 yesterday. While the CPI and PPI data coming from the USA are expected to increase volatility in BTC, analysis company Matrixport said that the upward trend in Bitcoin is expected to continue. Matrixport analysts said that Bitcoin broke out of the symmetrical triangle formation with its recent rise, signaling that the uptrend will continue. Analysts noted that Bitcoin's rally was powered by new capital inflows and gradually easing concerns about tariffs. Analysts also argued that although the inflation data to be released this week is expected to be high and put pressure on the BTC price, it will not be able to disrupt the upward trend. “Bitcoin broke the $106,000 downtrend line and even climbed above the symmetrical triangle pattern. This move indicates a new capital inflow, which bodes well for Bitcoin, and concerns about tariff uncertainty in the market appear to have eased. Although the US May Consumer Price Index (CPI) is expected to be higher, Bitcoin's current bullish momentum will be difficult to disrupt. Because the US economy is more resilient than expected and as long as Bitcoin maintains $105,075, the uptrend is expected to continue.” *This is not investment advice.

He outlined a vision where Midnight, combined with Bitcoin and Cardano, creates a “triumvirate” capable of solving deep financial system challenges.Midnight’s AmbitionMidnight is designed to facilitate cross-chain transactions and DeFi activities by leveraging advanced cryptographic techniques. According to Hoskinson, if users are willing to tolerate high fees and longer transaction finality, they can already perform Taproot-style transactions using SNARKs to move assets between chains, returning with gains or losses.However, to meet broader adoption goals, Midnight will employ a system of “operators” to manage and bundle transactions efficiently. This operator layer is being built under a project called Fairgate, which acts as the infrastructure stack for secure and fast interoperability. “You have tools like MPC, multi-signature, and trusted hardware,” Hoskinson explained. “Connect those, and you enable fast transactions with sub-minute latency and low fees, secured long-term by Bitcoin.” Fairgate, Thundercloud, and the Operator EconomyMeanwhile, the Cardano founder revealed that anyone could become an operator by running a full node or light client with the right software stack. Fairgate incorporates tech from Blockfrost, Hydra, and emerging efforts like Thundercloud. He noted that the team is exploring this potential fusion of Hydra and the Lightning Network with developer Adam Dean’s team.Fairgate will also use BitVMX to transition to RISC-V and Bitcoin Script, applying zero-knowledge cryptography for long-term security. With this, the user can choose high speed with lower fees and slightly reduced security or Bitcoin-grade finality for high-value transactions. “If BlackRock were to move $100 million, they’d likely use the Bitcoin-secured path,” said Hoskinson. “That’s the magic; users are in control.” Midnight Airdrop and Token Generation EventFurthermore, Hoskinson touched on the upcoming Midnight airdrop. He noted that Cardano holders will receive the largest distribution of Midnight tokens of any blockchain. Other participating chains include Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, and XRP Ledger.Notably, the Midnight Foundation will organize the upcoming Token Generation Event (TGE). It will kick off a full marketing campaign including tokenomics, infographics, and videos.Hoskinson noted that the Midnight Foundation will become operational this month and the next following the introduction of its president, Fahmi Syed.Big Players and Bigger PlansMeanwhile, Hoskinson also confirmed ongoing conversations between the Cardano Foundation and Franklin Templeton, a global investment firm. “We’ve known their CEO for years,” he said.He added that while their work may align more with the Foundation's mission, Cardano will engage them on Midnight. ""There’s a lot to discuss,"" he said. ""Cardano and Midnight, together with Bitcoin, which we call the triumvirate, can solve a lot of financial world challenges.""",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/10/hoskinson-says-midnight-could-be-the-biggest-economic-event-in-cardano-history/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=hoskinson-says-midnight-could-be-the-biggest-economic-event-in-cardano-history,"ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|AIRDROP","Market|Charles Hoskinson News|Latest Cardano (ADA) Crypto News Today",cryptocompare
2025-06-10T16:07:03,"Will Bitcoin continue rising? BTC faces reversal risk after confirming bearish shark pattern","A newly confirmed bearish shark harmonic pattern has formed on Bitcoin’s intraday chart, pointing to a potential retracement in the short term. With the value area high now under pressure and volume metrics signaling a lack of strong buyer commitment, Bitcoin may be setting up for a healthy pullback into deeper volume-supported zones. Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) latest move higher has brought it into technically significant territory, but not without warning signs. A bearish shark harmonic has emerged, suggesting a possible reversal following the recent grind to local highs. As price tests the value area high (VAH), a key inflection point is forming. If Bitcoin loses this level, the next logical targets include the point of control (POC) and the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, both offering strong confluence as support zones. Key technical points Bearish Shark Harmonic Confirmed: The pattern signals the potential for a price reversal or retracement from current levels. Critical Support Zones Below: The point of control and 0.618 Fibonacci lie beneath current price, acting as logical targets if VAH is lost. Volume Participation Remains Average: The recent move lacks the explosive profile of a short squeeze, raising doubts about sustainability. BTCUSDT (1H) Chart, Source: TradingView The bearish shark harmonic adds structure to the current market setup. This specific pattern typically forms at the end of extended corrective moves and often precedes short-term pullbacks. Bitcoin now faces its first major hurdle: the value area high. Failure to hold above this level could trigger a return to the point of control, which represents the highest volume node within the visible range. A further breakdown may open the path toward the value area low, suggesting a complete rotation within the current trading range. You might also like: Ethereum scales strong, but Lightchain AI leads presale with dev-first design Volume behavior supports this retracement thesis. Unlike previous surges characterized by short squeezes, the current rally has unfolded on average volume, without signs of aggressive forced buying. This weakens the bullish case and opens the door to a long squeeze, a slow unwind of long positions that forces traders to exit as price dips toward lower support levels. What to expect in the coming price action All eyes are now on the VAH. A decisive breakdown from this level would confirm the bearish harmonic and signal a controlled move into deeper support areas. Such a retracement would not only be technically valid but also constructive, allowing Bitcoin to reset within its current range before attempting another breakout.

2025-06-10T16:00:14,"Dogecoin Primed For Liftoff If It Can Break This Barrier: Key Price Targets","Dogecoin skidded to a low near $0.168 last week before snapping higher to trade around $0.19 on Tuesday morning, up roughly six percent over 24 hours. The rebound unfolded in lock-step with bitcoin’s own recovery from the technically charged $106,800 level to just above $109,000, re-invigorating short-term dip-buyers across the memecoin complex. Dogecoin Needs To Conquer This Price Level Technical analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) argues that the Fib defence has restored bullish structure—but only up to a point. “After coming down to the .382 Fib Dogecoin finally found the support it needed along with BTC finding support at 100K,” he wrote. “As it goes for the immediate future of **DOGE it has a lot of work to do. Big resistance at .19-.21 cent range will need to be broken in order to head back up to that .26-.28 level. Indicators on the daily time frame look bullish.” Bitcoin’s behaviour therefore remains pivotal. Spot BTC is hovering near $109,000 this morning and has so far defended the $106,800 pivot flagged by several high-profile analysts, including Michael van de Poppe, as the “linchpin for a potential rally”. Should Bitcoin extend toward the $120,000-$130,000 band, Kevin argues that Dogecoin will decouple from its dependence on the benchmark “when dominance tops and the market sniffs out easing monetary policy.” Crypto pundit Chandler (“@ChandlerCharts”) is less sanguine. Overlaying DOGE’s four-day price against DOGE/BTC, market cap and a relative-strength oscillator, his graphic highlights three prior compression phases—shaded grey—where the memecoin failed to sustain outperformance against Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bloodbath Incoming? Dogecoin Must Hold This Level To Survive “Even if DOGE breaks above its November highs, it won’t feel great if DOGE/BTC ends up way lower than it was at the November highs,” he cautioned. Chandler calculates that with BTC at $107,600, Dogecoin would have to print roughly $0.52 simply to reach a higher high against Bitcoin. “If BTC runs to $120-130k, DOGE needs to be around $0.60+ for holding DOGE to make sense over BTC.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Is Going To $1 With The ‘Next Impulse’, Analyst Predicts That threshold underscores the importance of the $0.19-$0.21 supply zone visible on both analysts’ charts. On Kevin’s canvas it coincides with the 0.618-0.703 Fib cluster; on Chandler’s, it overlaps the upper edge of an eighteen-month value area that has repeatedly rejected upside probes. A decisive close above $0.211 would place the May 11 summit at $0.2597 back in play and, more importantly for bulls. For now, traders are watching two numbers: $106,800 on Bitcoin and $0.21 on Dogecoin. A clean break of the latter would validate Kevin’s bullish roadmap toward $0.26-$0.28 and, by extension, keep alive the possibility of Chandler’s higher-high scenario on the DOGE/BTC cross. Until then, the memecoin’s fate indeed “remains in the hands of BTC’s capability in heading higher.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.19.

2025-06-10T16:00:14,"Ethereum ETF Inflows Mark 16 Incredible Days of Strong Growth","BitcoinWorld Ethereum ETF Inflows Mark 16 Incredible Days of Strong Growth The world of cryptocurrency investing is constantly evolving, and one of the most significant developments recently has been the emergence of U.S. spot ETH ETFs. These investment vehicles offer traditional investors an accessible way to gain exposure to Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, without directly holding the asset. Recently, the data has painted a remarkably positive picture for these new funds. On June 9th, U.S. spot ETH ETFs experienced a combined net inflow of $52.7 million . This figure, while perhaps modest compared to some days seen by Bitcoin ETFs, is highly significant as it marks the 16th consecutive trading day of net inflows into these products. This sustained positive trend suggests growing investor interest and confidence in the asset class via regulated financial instruments. What’s Driving These Strong Ethereum ETF Inflows? The consistent positive flow into Ethereum ETF inflows is a multi-faceted phenomenon, influenced by several key factors: Regulatory Clarity: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of the necessary regulatory filings (19b-4 forms) was a pivotal moment. Although S-1 registration statements still need final approval for trading to begin, the regulatory hurdle for listing has largely been cleared. This provides a level of legitimacy and certainty that attracts investors who were previously hesitant about direct crypto exposure. Institutional Interest: Large financial institutions often prefer regulated investment products like ETFs. The presence of major players like BlackRock and Fidelity launching their own ETH ETF products signals institutional confidence and provides familiar, trusted avenues for large capital allocation. Market Positioning: Investors may be positioning themselves ahead of the expected launch of trading for these ETFs. Buying into the funds now, even before public trading begins, allows them to secure their desired exposure early. Post-Approval Momentum: Following the SEC’s decision, there’s natural market momentum and media attention surrounding U.S. spot ETH ETFs , encouraging more investors to explore this option. Ethereum’s Fundamentals: Beyond the ETF structure, Ethereum itself has strong fundamentals, including its role in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and the broader web3 ecosystem. Investors buying the ETF are betting on the continued growth and adoption of the Ethereum network. Breaking Down the Daily Inflows for U.S. Spot ETH ETFs The data from Farside Investors highlights which funds are attracting the most capital. On June 9th, the inflows were distributed among several prominent issuers: Fund Issuer Net Inflow (June 9) ETHA BlackRock $35.2 million FETH Fidelity $12.9 million ETH Grayscale (mini) $4.6 million Other ETH ETFs Various $0 million BlackRock’s significant lead is notable, reflecting the firm’s massive reach and investor trust. Fidelity also captured a substantial portion, while Grayscale’s relatively new ‘mini’ fund (designed as a lower-fee alternative to its flagship product) is also seeing positive movement. The fact that other funds reported no change on this specific day isn’t necessarily negative; it simply means the net activity was concentrated in these three products for that trading session. Why Are Spot Ethereum ETFs Different? Understanding the difference between a Spot Ethereum ETF and other crypto investment products is crucial. Unlike futures-based ETFs, which track the price of futures contracts tied to an asset, a spot ETF holds the underlying asset directly – in this case, actual Ethereum. This is often preferred by investors because it aims to track the real-time market price of ETH more closely, without the complexities and potential contango/backwardation issues associated with futures markets. The approval of U.S. spot ETH ETFs follows the successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier in the year. The performance and significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs likely paved the way and built confidence for the approval of their Ethereum counterparts. This regulatory step is seen by many as a maturation of the crypto market, bringing it further into the traditional financial fold. What Does This Trend in Crypto ETFs Mean for the Market? The consistent stream of Crypto ETFs inflows, specifically into the new Ethereum products, has several potential implications for the broader market: Increased Legitimacy: The existence and success of these regulated products enhance the perception of crypto assets as legitimate investment classes among mainstream investors and financial advisors. Potential Price Impact: Sustained buying pressure from ETFs can absorb supply from the market, potentially leading to upward price movement for Ethereum. While $52.7 million in a single day might not cause immediate massive spikes, 16 consecutive days of millions flowing in creates a consistent demand floor. Broader Adoption: ETFs make investing in crypto significantly easier for individuals and institutions who are uncomfortable dealing with crypto exchanges, wallets, and private keys. This ease of access can drive broader adoption. Market Infrastructure Growth: The operational requirements for managing these ETFs necessitate robust infrastructure for custody, trading, and administration within the traditional finance system, further bridging the gap between TradFi and crypto. Potential Challenges and Considerations for Spot Ethereum ETF Investors While the inflows are positive, potential investors in a Spot Ethereum ETF should also be aware of potential challenges and risks: Market Volatility: Ethereum and the broader crypto market are known for significant price volatility. While the ETF structure provides ease of access, it doesn’t eliminate the inherent price risk of the underlying asset. Regulatory Uncertainty: Although listing has been approved, the regulatory landscape for crypto continues to evolve globally. Future regulations could impact the market or the ETFs themselves. Fees: ETFs charge management fees (expense ratios) which can eat into returns over time, especially compared to holding the asset directly (though direct holding has its own complexities and costs). Tracking Error: While aiming to track the spot price, ETFs can sometimes deviate slightly due to operational factors, though this is typically minimal for well-managed funds. Not Direct Ownership: Owning an ETF share is not the same as owning ETH directly. Investors do not have control over the underlying ETH (e.g., for staking, using in DeFi, or participating in network governance), which are key aspects of the Ethereum ecosystem. Actionable Insights for Potential Investors For those considering exposure to Ethereum, the availability and performance of U.S. spot ETH ETFs offer a new pathway. The sustained inflows suggest a positive market reception. However, it’s crucial to: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand both the potential benefits and the significant risks associated with investing in volatile assets like Ethereum and the ETFs that track them. Consider Your Investment Goals: Determine if an ETF aligns with your objectives regarding ease of access, long-term holding, and risk tolerance. Compare Products: Once trading launches, compare the different ETH ETFs available, paying attention to issuers, fees, and trading volume. Consult a Financial Advisor: Consider speaking with a qualified financial advisor who can help you assess if this investment fits into your overall financial plan. Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice. Investing in cryptocurrencies and related products like ETFs is highly speculative and involves significant risk of loss. Conclusion: A Bullish Sign for Ethereum’s Integration into Finance The consistent flow of capital into U.S. spot ETH ETFs , highlighted by the impressive $52.7 million inflow on June 9th and the streak of 16 consecutive positive days, is a powerful indicator. It underscores growing investor confidence and the increasing integration of Ethereum into traditional financial markets. While the journey for these products is just beginning, the initial reception, particularly the sustained positive inflows led by major players like BlackRock and Fidelity, paints a promising picture for the future accessibility and adoption of Ethereum as an asset class through regulated ETF structures. This trend is a significant development for the entire crypto ecosystem, signaling a maturing market attracting serious capital.

2025-06-10T15:57:41,"Peter Brandt Warns Bitcoin Could Face 75% Drop Similar to 2022 Crash","Peter Brandt, a respected figure in the trading community, recently warned that Bitcoin could face a dramatic price drop, drawing comparisons to its 2022 chart setup. His remarks come at a time when. Bitcoin has seen a notable 1.87% price increase in the last 24 hours and a 3.61% rise over the past week, now priced at $109,192. Despite the positive momentum, Brandt’s technical analysis suggests the market could be gearing up for a major reversal.Bearish Reversal ConcernsAccording to Brandt, the current setup mirrors the 2022 scenario, where Bitcoin underwent a substantial decline. He points out the presence of a Double Top pattern, a bearish technical formation that indicates potential price reversal.https://twitter.com/PeterLBrandt/status/1932391437636641256In addition, the Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) are also signaling a downward trend, further suggesting that the market may be heading for a correction.Technical Indicators Reflect Bearish SentimentThe chart provided by Brandt highlights the emergence of a Double Top pattern, which typically signals a bearish reversal in price action. For context, the first top formed when BTC claimed highs above $108,000 in December 2024 and January 2025.However, the asset faced a considerable decline below $100,000 after this peak. Interestingly, following the recovery that began in April, Bitcoin soared to a new all-time high near $112,000 last month, forming the second top. Notably, this Double Top pattern mirrors a similar setup seen in 2022. For context, Bitcoin hit an initial top of $65K in April 2021. After this, it dropped and then recovered to a second top of $69K in November 2021, marking its ATH. After the $69K peak, Bitcoin collapsed considerably, leading to the bear market. Brandt's chart suggests another drop could be looming again.Moreover, the 9-period EMA crossing below the 21-period EMA has historically marked the beginning of a downward trend, further reinforcing Brandt’s concerns. These technical indicators have led some traders to anticipate a potential 75% crash, should history repeat itself. A 75% decline from $109,192 would indeed bring Bitcoin’s price to around $27,298.Derivatives Data Shows Diverging TrendsAmid Brandt’s warnings, Bitcoin’s derivatives data paints a more complex picture. Bitcoin’s volume has surged by nearly 30%, now at $100.33 billion, indicating heightened market activity. This rise in volume typically precedes significant price movements. Moreover, open interest in Bitcoin has also increased by 1%.The Binance BTC/USDT Long/Short ratio of 0.5501 and the OKX BTC Long/Short ratio of 0.53 both indicate that more traders are holding short positions than long positions, suggesting a bearish sentiment in the market on these exchanges. Bitcoin Investment Products See OutflowsMeanwhile, Bitcoin’s investment products have seen modest outflows. Over the past week, Bitcoin faced $56.5 million in outflows, signaling a potential shift in investor sentiment. This comes as Ethereum has experienced strong inflows, leading the way with $296.4 million. The continued outflows from Bitcoin investment products, along with short-Bitcoin products, may further suggest that market participants are adjusting their expectations amid ongoing uncertainty.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/10/peter-brandt-warns-bitcoin-could-face-75-drop-similar-to-2022-crash/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=peter-brandt-warns-bitcoin-could-face-75-drop-similar-to-2022-crash,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|BNB","Market|Bitcoin Price Prediction|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today",cryptocompare

2025-06-10T15:52:11,"Tether to open-source upcoming Bitcoin mining operating system","Stablecoin giant Tether will open-source its Bitcoin mining software to help smaller miners participate in the mining sector without having to depend on expensive platforms. According to Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, who announced the plans in a recent X post , the idea behind this initiative is to “make mining great again,” and part of a broader effort to decentralize Bitcoin’s infrastructure. The Bitcoin Mining Operating System (MOS), scheduled for release in the fourth quarter of 2025, will be freely available with full documentation and user guides. Tether says this will enable companies of all sizes to operate mining setups without relying on proprietary third-party software, lowering the cost of entry for smaller players. The decision to open-source MOS comes at a time when the Bitcoin mining sector is becoming increasingly competitive. Larger firms continue to dominate due to economies of scale, favourable electricity contracts, and access to capital markets. Following the 2024 halving, many of these firms have shifted their strategies by building large Bitcoin treasuries or repurposing hardware for artificial intelligence applications. By contrast, small-to-mid-sized mining operations have struggled to keep up with growing infrastructure costs and high upfront capital requirements. Tether’s initiative aims to level the playing field by offering open-source tools that can run on both minimal hardware setups, such as Raspberry Pi boards, and large-scale mining farms. What is MOS? Ardoino said the MOS was designed with a peer-to-peer Internet of Things architecture and supports a wide array of hardware vendors, including immersion and air-cooled containers, as well as electrical components such as thermostats. This flexibility is expected to make the system more accessible to smaller operators, including businesses generating their own energy through solar or hydro setups. One of MOS’s standout features is its modular plugin system, which would allow developers to create and share custom components suited to various mining setups, making the overall architecture more customizable according to operational needs. There are also plans to integrate Tether’s in-house decentralized AI platform QVAC (QuantumVerse Automatic Computer), which allows AI agents to run locally on user devices without relying on cloud services. A QVAC integration would help “build better reports and enhance production/performance based on custom AI tools that learn from the huge datasets generated by the Mining OS,” Ardiono added. Simply put, QVAC enables mining operations to deploy AI agents directly on local hardware, allowing for real-time performance optimization, predictive maintenance, and improved energy efficiency. The latest decision is one of the many initiatives launched by Tether to support decentralization within the Bitcoin ecosystem. In April, the stablecoin issuer partnered with the Ocean mining pool to help distribute block-building power by directing its hashrate to the protocol. At the time, Ardiono said Tether intends to “fortify Bitcoin against centralizing forces.” The post Tether to open-source upcoming Bitcoin mining operating system appeared first on Invezz",invezz,https://invezz.com/news/2025/06/10/tether-to-open-source-upcoming-bitcoin-mining-operating-system-to-promote-decentralization/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MINING|TECHNOLOGY|USDT","Crypto|Crypto business|Bitcoin|Tether",cryptocompare

2025-06-10T15:41:00,"Bitcoin Trading Volume Surpasses 3-Day Average, Signalling Strong Buyer Conviction (Technical Analysis)","Summary Bitcoin rallies 4.5% on Monday to hit $110,600 after strong volume surge. Early Tuesday dip sees Bitcoin retrace 1% to $109,100. Golden cross at $105,400 reinforces bullish momentum. By Artem Shendetskii Bitcoin's price ( BTC-USD ) started the second week of June 2025 on a strong note, rallying by 4.5% on Monday to reach a high at $110,600. This marks the fourth consecutive daily gain and extends its bullish momentum deeper into all-time high territory. What made Monday’s move significant was the increase in trading volume, which exceeded that of the previous three days, highlighting strong conviction from buyers. The surge pushed Bitcoin to within 1.3% of its all-time high at $112,000, setting the tone for potential upside continuation. However, early Tuesday trading has seen some pullback. The price declined gradually from the Monday close and is currently down 1% on the day, trading near $109,100 as of the European session. The slight drop has reduced this week’s cumulative gain to 3.5%, although the month-to-date performance still holds a solid 4.2% advance. BTC price dynamics (Jan - June 2025). Source: TradingView This retracement does not come unexpectedly. On the 4-hour chart, Monday’s price surge pushed the RSI indicator into overbought territory, which likely triggered some profit-taking by short-term traders. Bitcoin golden cross at $105,400 solidifies short-term bullish bias The technical backdrop, however, still paints a bullish picture. Monday’s surge caused a golden cross formation at $105,400 on the 4-hour timeframe. The 20 EMA crossed above both the 50 and 100 EMAs, and the 50 EMA also moved above the 100 EMA, reinforcing upward price momentum. This golden cross now places the 20 EMA around the $107,000 zone, a level that could act as the first line of defense in the event of deeper intraday pullbacks. Despite today’s mild decline, the broader trend remains supported by the daily RSI, which continues to hover in bullish territory without flashing any fresh overbought warnings. If the price finds support at $107,000 and volume steps back in, Bitcoin may resume its ascent. The key barrier to break is the $110,775 supply level. A decisive move above that level could open the path toward testing the all-time high at $112,000. Unless selling pressure intensifies below $107,000, the outlook leans toward a potential recovery in the upcoming sessions, fuelled by the ongoing technical strength and momentum. Bitcoin extends three-day rally from a four-week low but faces intraday resistance . Key EMAs converge to form a critical support zone around $105,350.
