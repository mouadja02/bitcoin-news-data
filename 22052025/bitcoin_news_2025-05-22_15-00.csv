He Trolled Cryptocurrency Detective ZachXBT!","Following the recent data breach targeting Coinbase users, the hacker behind the breach took action following the recent spike. The hacker swapped $42.5 million worth of Bitcoin for Ethereum (ETH) via ThorChain to launder the stolen funds. Hacker mocks blockchain researcher ZachXBT following Bitcoin (BTC) Etheruem swap The hacker sent an on-chain message to ZachXBT using Ethereum transaction login data that included the phrase “L bozo” and then posted a meme video of NBA player James Worthy smoking a cigar. ZachXBT flagged the message on his Telegram channel, writing that the wallet that handles the BTC-ETH exchange is associated with the hacker responsible for the Coinbase data breach that affected at least 69,400 users. The Coinbase data breach, first reported in a filing with the Maine Attorney General's Office, occurred in December 2024 but was uncovered on May 11. Coinbnase stated that the stolen data included names, home addresses and other personal information, while the hackers demanded a ransom of $20 million in Bitcoin for the release of the stolen data. However, Coinbase refused to pay the ransom and instead offered a $20 million reward for information leading to the identification of the hackers. Coinbase estimates that the data breach could cost them up to $400 million, while the U.S. Department of Justice has launched a formal investigation into the breach. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-22T12:40:45.000Z,"ECB Warns of Financial Instability, Holding Bitcoin Becomes a Necessity. What Crypto to Buy Next?","The European Central Bank (ECB) is sounding the alarm in its latest Financial Stability Review, pointing to a debt crisis, potential banking sector shocks, and an increasingly fragile financial system. America’s financial engine is also sputtering, but Mike Novogratz, founder of Galaxy Digital, argues that the weakening dollar, ballooning deficits, and deteriorating U.S. economy are good news. For Bitcoin and crypto, at any rate. While politicians fumble, markets wobble, and central banks cross their fingers, one option remains rock solid: Bitcoin. If holding Bitcoin is now a must, as some experts now claim, then the next logical step is figuring out what crypto to buy next. As the System Flounders, Bitcoin Looks Like a Lifeboat The ECB’s report doesn’t sugarcoat it. Governments across Europe are sitting on massive debt piles, and unless growth magically picks up, concerns about sovereign debt could resurface fast. That means more bailouts, more liquidity injections, and likely, more long-term damage to the currency. Dr. Jan, a longtime critic of centralized monetary policy, pointed out that this isn’t a minor bump in the road – it’s a real systemic risk. Global risks are rising. In its latest Financial Stability Review, the ECB warns of growing risks to sovereign debt sustainability and the broader stability of the financial sector: “Unless potential growth can be raised, concerns about sovereign debt sustainability could… pic.twitter.com/A9jdOgYwmp — Dr. Jan Wüstenfeld (@JanWues) May 21, 2025 The ECB also points to households and companies being under increasing pressure, and warns that any spillover into the banking sector could cause disorderly market conditions. Meanwhile, Japan’s bond market is flashing red, with yields spiking to historic highs. If investors begin questioning whether sovereign bonds are even safe anymore, it’s game over for the traditional playbook. In this climate, holding Bitcoin is no longer some fringe hedge – it’s a rational, defensive move. It’s not about betting on the collapse of the system. It’s simply preparing for what many experts now see as an inevitable shift in how value is stored and protected. Crypto is becoming the safety net that fiat currencies can no longer promise. With that in mind, let’s explore three new crypto projects worth a second look. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Last Chance to Buy the Token Supercharging Solana Solaxy ($SOLX) isn’t just the first-ever Solana Layer-2 – it’s the fix the Solana ecosystem has been begging for. Solana is famous for its blazing speed and low fees, but it’s been plagued by congestion, scalability issues, and failed transactions. Solaxy neutralizes these issues while enhancing what already works on Solana. It boosts speed, improves throughput, and ensures reliability. It’s like giving a sports car a turbo engine and four-wheel drive. $SOLX is the native token of this next-gen blockchain, and it’s multichain. Being built on both Ethereum and Solana, Solaxy bridges the world’s most liquid DeFi ecosystem with the fast-paced meme coin battlefield. In a time when faith in traditional systems is slipping, Solaxy stands out as a fresh new DeFi solution with real utility and scale. Priced at just $0.001732 and with the presale raise crossing $39M, Solaxy’s momentum is going strong, but time is running out. There are only 25 days left to buy before the presale ends. Picture this: if our $SOLX price predictions are correct and it hits just $0.032 by the end of 2025 (a conservative high), that’s a 1,746% increase. Stake 100K tokens today at the current price of $0.001732 for a 15% APY, and by next year, you’d have 115K tokens. At the projected price, that stack could be worth $3,680 – from just a $173 investment today. 2. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – The Only Meme Coin That Drops You Real Bitcoin BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) isn’t your average meme coin. It’s a Bitcoin-propelled rocket engine built to reward its holders every time Bitcoin breaks a new price milestone. When $BTC hits $150K, $200K, and beyond, $BTCBULL holders receive real Bitcoin – airdropped directly into their wallets. No mining. No need to buy a full Bitcoin. Just buy and hold $BTCBULL in Best Wallet and get rewarded. BTC Bull Token also burns its own supply every time Bitcoin crosses increments like $125K, $175K, and $225K, tightening circulation and increasing scarcity with each leg of the bull run. It’s a token built to mirror Bitcoin’s rise – while multiplying the upside for those who get in early. At just $0.002525, and with over $6.1M raised, the presale is already attracting serious momentum. The token is stakable too, with an APY of 67%, offering passive income while waiting for those juicy Bitcoin milestone airdrops. And with Bitcoin smashing through $111K it’s clear this isn’t retail hype – it’s a structural shift. BTC Bull Token lets anyone plug into that upside, even with just a few bucks. But with only days left in the current crypto presale round, time’s ticking. The next price jump is around the corner. 3. Dogwifhat ($WIF) – Solana’s Viral Meme Coin Turning Chaos Into Comedy and Cash When people lose faith in institutions, they don’t just run to gold – they run to memes. Dogwifhat ($WIF) , Solana’s most viral meme coin, has become an internet-powered protest coin, riding a cultural wave that mocks the traditional financial system collapsing under its own weight. $WIF isn’t just another dog token. It’s a symbol of unity against the banking system. Like Dogecoin before it, $WIF blends absurdist humor with community power, offering a decentralized outlet for people fed up with inflation, bailouts, and broken banks. It’s pure memetic momentum – funny, defiant, and fast. Built on Solana, $WIF benefits from near-instant transactions and low fees, making it ideal for the retail masses driving its explosive rise. And it’s not slowing down. Priced at $1.15 and pumping +165% this month, $WIF is on a tear while the rest of the world worries about sovereign debt. In a world where trust in fiat is waning, $WIF offers something no central bank can print: social currency. If Bitcoin is digital gold, $WIF is digital graffiti – loud, fearless, and right on the money. When Systems Shake, Crypto Shines Bright With Mike Novogratz warning about America’s financial cracks and the ECB flagging similar systemic risks in Europe, the old system is clearly cracking. In that context, Bitcoin is no longer a luxury – it’s a necessity. But beyond $BTC, projects like $SOLX , $BTCBULL , and $WIF offer unique ways to pivot to the new. Whether you’re seeking safety, passive income, or pure meme-powered rebellion, now’s the time to act. Remember to always do your own research (DYOR) before investing in crypto.

This optimism in Dogecoin price was a result of Bitcoin price reaching a new all-time high at $111903, with rising optimism investors accumulated massively, as recent whale activity also showed by whale alerts that showed that $57.6 million worth 250 million DOGE tokens were transferred from Robinhood to an unknown wallet. Many experts are anticipating a big rise in the Elon Musk favorite and eighth-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, as its adoption is rising with merchant acceptance increasing, making it more than a meme now. The experts began voicing short-term targets to $0.31, with bullish formation. Keep reading to know more. Is Dogecoin Price Geared For $0.31 The recent DOGE crypto run, influenced by BTC’s rise, has attracted many experts. Among them, widely followed cryptocurrency analyst and trader Ali Martinez spotted DOGE’s breakout from a bull pennant formation, suggesting a price target of $0.31. He says, A bullish pennant is a continuation chart pattern that has developed on an hourly chart, indicating resumption of an uptrend after a pause or consolidation period. #Dogecoin $DOGE appears to be breaking out of a bull pennant, which suggests a target of $0.31! pic.twitter.com/Hbzuwd7Akk — Ali (@ali_charts) May 22, 2025 Moreover, coming to the daily chart, it highlights that in the entire Q2 2025 so far, the DOGE crypto rose over 80% from a low of $0.130 to $0.240, which happened due to a variety of internal factors like the development of the DOGEOS App and external factors like geopolitical trade deal easing tensions. The DOGE crypto seems primed as the asset is showing bullishness and rising potential as it firmly remains above the 20-day EMA band , which is influenced by the buyers’ surge. Based on the Fibonacci tool, the 0.5 fibo level is critical at $0.308 to $ 0.31, which could attract in the short term, but in the long term, the zone between fibo 0.5 and 0.62 is of extreme importance, once cleared, the DOGE price prediction suggests that in the coming months, it could even rise to $0.484 or higher. But if $0.31 dominates bull, then this level could repel the trajectory back to the demand zone near $0.15. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Top 5 Altcoins to Buy As Bitcoin Hits New ATH! , Major On-chain Support Doge Price Bullish Outlook The last 30-day Active addresses increased from 775K to the current 1.8 million, which represents the number of wallets engaging with a project. This shows users are once again engaging in numerous transactions on the network. This illustrates that more people are using and trading the token, which implies a higher demand and value for the token. Also, the crypto has witnessed a continuous surge in the total number of holders in the last six months, from nearly 7Million in January, it has reached 7.95 million, which is a strong number. Similarly, the percentage of the total supply in profit for DOGE crypto is currently at 80.42%, which means that this is the overall number of assets in the supply that were bought at a lower price than the current market price. Source: Santiment Additionally, based on Santiment metrics, the rise in 30-day MVRV from a low of negative 26% in March to its current positive 16% in May is also bullish. A positive 30-day MVRV indicates that, on average, DOGE holders who acquired their tokens within the last 30 days are currently in profit. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Solana coin price could reach a potential high of $400 in 2025. With a potential surge, the SOL price could hit $1,351 by 2030. Solana is coming true to its community-claimed title, “Ethereum-Killer,” as it gradually surpasses Ethereum in the decentralized market. In a recent feat, Solana’s TVL crossed $10.9 billion, influenced by fee growth, increased staking, and rising DeFi use cases. However, with the ongoing volatility amid the cryptocurrency market crash, the Solana price currently trades at a discount of 39.56% from its ATH of $ 294.33. Following this, crypto investors are storming Google with questions like “Will Solana Go Back Up?” or “How high can Solana go?” and “Will SOL price reach $500 this altcoin season?” To answer more such questions, we bring to you our Solana price prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030.

2025-05-22T12:24:53.000Z,"Bitcoin trades above $110,000 as US ETF inflows surge 85%","Bitcoin crossed the $110,000 threshold for the first time on Wednesday, triggering renewed interest from US-based investors. The price action coincided with a sharp rise in inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, which jumped 85% in a single day to reach $609 million. The increased activity points to rising institutional and retail demand from US markets, with analysts tracking a positive shift in sentiment as the coin eyes new highs. This resurgence comes after weeks of consolidation, suggesting that Bitcoin’s upward momentum is being reinforced by macro-level support from regulated investment products and investor appetite across exchanges. Premium Index hits 24-day high On-chain data from CryptoQuant shows that the Coinbase Premium Index (CPI) spiked to its highest level in 24 days as BTC broke above $110,000. This metric tracks the price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase and Binance, offering insight into regional demand dynamics. When CPI is above zero, it suggests strong buying pressure from US investors. A negative reading reflects muted interest or sell-offs in US markets. The recent spike indicates that traders on Coinbase were willing to pay a premium, showing bullish sentiment tied to American investor behaviour. ETF inflows keep rising The inflow into spot Bitcoin ETFs reached $609 million on Wednesday, up from $329.02 million the previous day. This marks six straight days of net positive flows, indicating growing interest in regulated investment products tied to BTC. This surge in capital into ETFs comes amid broader optimism around Bitcoin’s long-term potential, following earlier hesitation in the first quarter of 2025. Increased regulatory clarity and improving market conditions have contributed to this trend, making ETFs a key vehicle for traditional investors entering the crypto space. The momentum in ETF investments is helping to reinforce BTC’s recent rally, particularly among institutional participants who prefer regulated exposure to volatile assets. BTC price: technical outlook At the time of writing, BTC trades at $111,084, just below its all-time high of $111,888. Source: CoinMarketCap According to daily chart data, Bitcoin’s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) stands at 0.30, indicating capital inflows remain strong. A CMF reading above zero points to net buying activity, supporting the thesis that traders are accumulating rather than exiting positions. If this momentum persists, BTC may reclaim its recent high and establish a new price record. However, a downside correction remains possible if profit-taking intensifies. In that scenario, analysts suggest a short-term dip towards $103,882 as a potential support level. Macro and ETF trends in focus The coordinated rise in both CPI and ETF inflows underscores the role of the US market in shaping Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory. While global liquidity and investor sentiment continue to evolve, the data suggests that demand from US institutions and retail traders remains a dominant driver of price movements. As long as ETF inflows stay positive and technical indicators reflect accumulation, the bullish case for BTC remains intact. However, traders are also monitoring potential headwinds from macroeconomic shifts or regulatory updates, which could influence market dynamics in the coming weeks.

2025-05-22T12:22:10.000Z,"Bitcoin miners’ record sales preceded rally - what’s next for supply?","In April 2025, Bitcoin miners sold more BTC than they produced - about 115% of their monthly output. That’s a big deal. It means miners had to dip into their reserves, signaling financial pressure across the industry. Despite Bitcoin trading near $111,000 - close to its all-time high - the economics of mining have gotten tougher. The 2024 halving slashed rewards, and rising energy costs have squeezed profits. Many miners took the opportunity to sell while prices were high, helping them stay afloat. This wave of selling added a lot of Bitcoin to the market, boosting trading volumes and triggering short-term price swings. Some traders saw it as a bearish signal, while others - especially institutions - used the sell-off to buy more. ETF inflows stayed strong, showing long-term confidence. Miners are adapting. They’re upgrading to more efficient machines, hunting for cheaper or renewable energy, and even offering services like AI computing. Still, some are being forced to sell more frequently, especially those with older setups or in regions with high costs. What’s next? With fewer new coins entering circulation and more BTC moving to cold storage, supply is tightening. That could help support prices in the long run. But keep an eye on miner reserves, regulation changes, and whether institutions keep buying. Those will be key drivers for Bitcoin going forward.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9224/bitcoin-miners-record-sales-preceded-rally-what-s-next-for-supply,"BTC|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-05-22T12:14:26.000Z,"Bitcoin Rally Is Still Healthy Despite New ATH: On-Chain Data","Bitcoin (BTC) surged past $111,000 for the first time on Thursday, marking a historic all-time high. The rally is being driven by strong capital inflows, particularly from institutional investors. Despite concerns of a pullback, new data suggest that the Bitcoin market is still in a healthy upward phase. Market Calm as Bitcoin Soars According to a report by CryptoQuant, the funding rate, which is commonly used to gauge speculative pressure, shows a recent uptick in long positions, but the scale remains modest when compared to previous market tops. Similarly, data on coins traded within a 1-week to 1-month timeframe, which is often used to assess short-term capital inflows, indicates that current inflows are relatively subdued, especially when measured against the rapid influxes seen during earlier bull runs. Notably, short-term holders have shown little inclination to take profits amid the recent rally. In contrast to the heavy profit-taking that triggered a correction in March 2024 and again in November 2024, current selling pressure remains limited, even among large whale accounts. Additionally, Bitcoin holdings in US-listed spot ETFs have also reached record highs, reflecting strong demand from investors. Overall, CryptoQuant believes that the current rally is being driven by sustainable factors as overheating signals remain relatively muted. Institutions Take the Lead Bitcoin’s latest ATH appears to be structurally different from past retail-driven rallies, according to experts. In a statement to CryptoPotato , Kushal Manupati, Binance’s Regional Growth & Ops Lead of South Asia, also echoed a similar sentiment. “Bitcoin has surged past the $111,000 mark, setting a new all-time high and reinforcing its position as the bellwether of the virtual digital assets revolution. This exponential rally is the result of increasing institutional participation, maturing global regulations, and growing mainstream recognition of Bitcoin as a legitimate store of value. From a technological curiosity to a globally held asset, Bitcoin’s rise has been powered by transparency.” Instead of speculative hype, the current uptrend is fueled by disciplined institutional accumulation, Santiment said in its update , while highlighting six consecutive days of ETF inflows and reduced retail FOMO as signs of a maturing market. The standout performer is BlackRock’s spot ETF, IBIT, which now holds over 636,000 BTC, which, interestingly, happens to be more than the next 14 U.S. spot ETFs combined. Institutional giants like Mubadala and Citadel are increasing exposure through IBIT. Meanwhile, corporate buyers like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet continued to ramp up their BTC holdings with more purchases. With Bitcoin gaining over 25% in the past 30 days and nearly 60% year-over-year, Santiment expects the rally could extend to $115K-$120K. Meanwhile, the low retail interest may be contributing to the rally’s stability, creating a clear runway for institutional capital to lead the charge.

2025-05-22T12:12:32.000Z,"Strategy Plans to Sell Up to $2.1 Billion in 10% Preferred Stock – Massive Bitcoin Purchase Coming?","Key Takeaways: Strategy plans to raise up to $2.1 billion by selling 10% preferred stock listed as “STRF” on Nasdaq. The move has fueled speculation of another major Bitcoin purchase, though no plans were explicitly confirmed. The stock offers a 10% annual dividend and redemption rights tied to tax events or major company changes. Michael Saylor’s Strategy, known for its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy, has announced plans to raise as much as $2.1 billion through the sale of its 10% Series A Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock. The disclosure was made in a filing dated May 22, 2025, outlining a sales agreement with TD Securities, Barclays Capital, and The Benchmark Company to issue shares on an ongoing basis. The preferred stock, trading under the ticker “STRF” on Nasdaq, closed at $100.65 on May 21. Strategy to Buy More Bitcoin? The capital raise follows a similar structure to Strategy’s previous fundraising rounds, many of which directly funded large-scale Bitcoin purchases. While the filing does not explicitly state that the proceeds will be used to buy Bitcoin, the move has sparked speculation across markets that another major crypto buy may be in the works. The offering allows MicroStrategy to sell shares at market prices or through negotiated deals and block trades. There’s no escrow arrangement — sales will be conducted over time at the company’s discretion. The agents involved are entitled to up to 2% in commission from gross proceeds, and the preferred stock itself carries a 10% annual dividend, paid quarterly in cash if declared by the board. BREAKING: Strategy to sell up to $2.1 billion of 10% preferred stock. pic.twitter.com/80oWuoGg79 — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) May 22, 2025 The latest issuance comes in addition to the 8.5 million shares of the perpetual preferred stock already outstanding. The new shares will carry the same terms, including a $100 liquidation preference and voting rights. Investors are entitled to regular dividends and redemption rights in the event of significant changes, such as tax events or structural shifts in the company’s business. Strategy also retains the right to redeem the preferred stock if the outstanding share count drops below 25% of the total ever issued or if a qualifying tax event occurs. If a “fundamental change” takes place, such as a merger, sale, or delisting, shareholders can require the company to repurchase their shares at face value plus unpaid dividends, per the filing. Strategy Could Become Top Publicly Traded Company in World Jeff Walton, an analyst at Strategy, has said the firm may one day rise to become the top publicly traded company in the world. Walton believes the company’s unprecedented exposure to Bitcoin, which recently crossed $104,000, gives it a unique edge. “Strategy holds more of the best asset and most pristine collateral on the planet than any other company, by multiples,” he said. As reported, Strategy added another 7,390 BTC to its growing Bitcoin treasury, spending $764.9 million during the week of May 12–18 at an average price of $103,498 per coin. T As of May 18, Strategy held a total of 576,230 BTC, acquired at an average cost of $69,726 per coin, totaling $40.18 billion. The company’s Bitcoin-focused strategy has yielded a 16.3% return so far in 2025, supported by Bitcoin’s rally above $104,000.

2025-05-22T12:10:52.000Z,"Sui DEX Cetus suspected of being hacked: Over $200M in potential losses","Cetus, a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Sui blockchain, is suspected to be undergoing a massive exploit that may have drained more than $200 million worth of digital assets. Pseudonymous Web3 researcher COMDARE3 posted on X that “users report” that Sui-based DEX Cetus is being exploited.” He also shared a screenshot of Cetus market data on DEX Screener , showing many assets losing well over half of their value over the last 24 hours. Cetus did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comments about the suspected exploit. Cetus pool data shows that as of the time of writing, the DEX processed $2.9 billion worth of transactions on May 22, an 89% increase from the $320 million reported on May 21. This heightened level of activity may have been caused by funds being siphoned out of the protocol. Some tokens, such as Lombard Staked BTC (LBTC) or AXOLcoin (AXOL) lost the near totality of their value on Cetus. The top 15 losers all lost in excess of three-quarters of their price. Cetus DEX-listed asset pricing data. Source: DEX Screener Outside Cetus, LBTC appears to have gained over 4% in value over the last 24% according to CoinMarketCap data . Others, such as Axol (AXOL), have not been as fortunate, with CoinMarketCap data showing a loss of nearly 99.5%. The alleged exploiter’s address contains nearly $52 million of Sui ( SUI ) tokens, $4.9 million of Haedal Staked SUI (HASUI), over $19.5 million of Toilet (TOILET), nearly $19.5 million of wrapped USDt ( USDT ) and many other assets. The official Cetus X profile confirmed that an incident on the protocol was detected, and the smart contract was paused for safety. It added that an investigation is ongoing.

2025-05-22T12:09:49.000Z,"Why XRP Price Skyrocketed After the U.S. Election: Report Explains","The post Why XRP Price Skyrocketed After the U.S. Election: Report Explains appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A newly published report in the American Bankruptcy Law Journal by legal scholar Jessica G. McKinlay reveals a strong link between XRP’s explosive price surge and the recent political shift in the U.S. , following Donald Trump’s victory over Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. Let’s break down the key insights from the report. The report highlights that Trump’s crypto-friendly policy proposals played a significant role in XRP’s 443% rally between November 5 and December 2, 2024 , when the price jumped from $0.50 to $2.72 . By mid-January 2025 , XRP touched a 7-year high of $3.40 , reflecting growing investor confidence after Trump’s promise to: Support innovation in the crypto sector Establish clearer regulations Reduce government interference in digital assets In contrast, Kamala Harris’s stance was less defined, leading to market uncertainty before the election results. Ripple’s Legal Battle Gets Boost After SEC Leadership Change One of the most critical factors behind XRP’s rise, the report notes, is the replacement of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler with Paul S. Atkins , a move widely seen as favorable for the crypto industry. Ripple’s long-running legal dispute with the SEC under Gensler had cast a shadow over XRP for years. The new leadership brought renewed hope for resolution and regulatory clarity, which triggered a bullish rally in the market. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple Doubles Its Bid to $11B to Acquire Circle — But Coinbase Wants In Too! , Bitcoin & Ethereum Also Benefit from Political Shift While XRP was the biggest gainer, Bitcoin and Ethereum also posted notable gains in November 2024: Bitcoin (BTC) rose 37.4% , eventually hitting the $100K milestone Ethereum (ETH) surged 47.4% during the same period The report praises Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake for its reduced energy use, while also criticizing Bitcoin’s centralized mining practices and environmental impact . XRP and the Trump Effect: A Turning Point for Crypto? The report concludes that Trump’s regulatory stance , combined with the SEC reshuffle , created a favorable environment for XRP to thrive.

Options Whales Are On The Rise Again: Here Are The Record Levels They've Been Waiting For!","The leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) broke new ATH in the rising wave it started yesterday. The Bitcoin price, which continues to rise, broke a record by exceeding $ 111,000 on Thursday morning. As Bitcoin raced from record to record, this rise increased trading on options exchange Deribit. Accordingly, the rally in Bitcoin led to record activity in the Deribit options market, bringing new highs. Speaking to Coindesk, Deribit CEO Luuk Strijers reported that after the new record in Bitcoin, the open interest value of Deribit Bitcoin options broke a record by rising to $42.5 billion. Stating that BTC reaching record levels also mobilized option whales, Strijers said that traders are betting on higher prices. According to Deribit CEO, the most popular options were $110,000, $120,000 and $300,000. “The majority of options traded in the past 24 hours have been $120,000 and $130,000 calls for the end of May and June. The most popular options are $110,000, $120,000 and $300,000, expiring on June 27.

2025-05-22T12:00:00.000Z,"IBIT: 'Full Pac-Man' At All Time Highs","Summary BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has entered the top 5 ETFs by net inflows in 2025, signaling strong investor demand. IBIT attracted $8.9 billion in inflows year-to-date, surpassing many established ETFs and highlighting growing mainstream acceptance of bitcoin exposure. There are concerns to consider, however, with signs of exhaustion in Bitcoin's weekly chart as well as a lack of demand for the other BTC ETFs in the US. I remain bullish BTC and by extension IBIT but think the top isn't terribly far away at this point. With Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) hitting a fresh all-time high of $110,000 per coin, capital flows into the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (NASDAQ: IBIT ) are surging. Despite still personally having an affinity for fundamentals and usage, I've been making the case that Bitcoin's price has been entirely driven by capital flows for awhile. Demand from ETF buyers and from companies like Strategy ( MSTR )( STRF ) is what has been driving the coin's price. Thus, with a new all-time achieved on May 21st, we can look at metrics like net flow, supply, volume, and price moving averages to ascertain whether this is likely the start of a new leg that will take the coin much higher, or if it's more of a sign that we're close to the price top for this cycle. iShares Has Gone 'Full Pac-Man' Credit to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas for the 'full Pac-Man' characterization. What he's referring to is the IBIT ETF chewing up Bitcoin as though it were the vintage video game character eating dots in a maze. As of May 20th, IBIT had experienced $8.9 billion in net flow year to date: ETF Flows YTD (Eric Balchunas/X) That level of capital flow makes IBIT far and away the biggest beneficiary of investment demand relative to all of the other spot Bitcoin ETFs. Not only that, but IBIT has had the 5th largest year to date inflows of all ETFs . IBIT's hoard of BTC is now so large, that the 636k BTC held through IBIT is currently larger than the BTC supply held by the remaining US-based spot ETFs combined: Spot BTC Fund BTC Held USD Value Share of Supply iShares Bitcoin Trust 636,120 $69,798m 3.03% Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ) 199,840 $21,927m 0.95% Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) 187,870 $20,614m 0.90% ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ) 49,166 $5,395m 0.23% Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ( BTC ) 42,718 $4,687m 0.20% Bitwise Bitcoin ETF ( BITB ) 38,268 $4,199m 0.18% VanEck Bitcoin Trust ( HODL ) 14,763 $1,620m 0.07% Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF ( BTCO ) 8,780 $963m 0.04% CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ( BRRR ) 6,554 $719m 0.03% Franklin Bitcoin ETF ( EZBC ) 5,097 $559m 0.02% WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund ( BTCW ) 3,746 $411m 0.02% Sum ex-IBIT 556,802 $61,049m 2.65% Source: Bitcoin Treasuries, as of May 21st IBIT now controls more than 3% of BTC supply and holds more Bitcoin than Strategy. What I find so interesting about the surge in IBIT net flows this year is it is unique to this fund when factoring in the other spot ETFs in the US. Consider the year to date changes in supply held through each product: Fund BTC Balance 5/21/25 1/1/25 YTD Change iShares Bitcoin Trust 636,120 552,168 15.2% Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund 199,840 202,800 -1.5% Grayscale Bitcoin Trust 187,870 206,835 -9.2% ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF 49,166 46,729 5.2% Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust 42,718 38,342 11.4% Bitwise Bitcoin ETF 38,268 40,196 -4.8% VanEck Bitcoin Trust 14,763 13,716 7.6% Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF 8,780 8,780 0.0% CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund 6,554 8,846 -25.9% Franklin Bitcoin ETF 5,097 7,567 -32.6% WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund 3,746 3,841 -2.5% Source: Bitcoin Treasuries, as of May 21st The 15% growth in BTC year to date for IBIT is top among all funds and IBIT is one of just four US spot ETFs that has positive BTC-denominated net flow year to date. One of the other funds with positive net flow in 2025 is Grayscale's Bitcoin Mini Trust. However, aggregating net flow totals for both of Grayscale's spot products has the issuer negative year to date as well. The VanEck fund's YTD net flow Is just 1,000 BTC year to date. ARK has done slightly better than that. But the point is, what IBIT is doing is impressive. Can This Continue? One thing that I think is worth paying attention to is the volume surge that took place in IBIT shares during the May 21st session. The fund did just under 99 million shares traded intraday. IBIT Daily Chart (TrendSpider) The chart above shows just three instances of at least 98 million shares traded intraday during green sessions so far this year; today is the third such instance. The prior two instances of green candle volume to this degree happened on days of significant directional pivots. The first such instance happened on January 23rd. IBIT subsequently fell by nearly 28% through the beginning of March. It happened again on April 7th. Much like what we saw in a volatile session for stocks that day, this spike signaled the low and IBIT has rallied more than 45% since. This spike is obviously coming after a large surge in price over a relatively short amount of time. The implication here being any directional price pivot in tandem with this volume surge would actually be to the downside. Taking a more long-term view of Bitcoin, the weekly chart might be exhibiting signs of impending exhaustion as well: BTC Monthly Chart (TrendSpider) I've marked moments where the 8 week MA flips over the 20 week MA with arrows. You can see this just happened for BTC this week (the week of May 19th). The last time it happened was the week of October 14th and the cross preceded a 56% surge over the next 2 months. However, at that time Bitcoin hadn't yet broken resistance and the coin was coming off seven months of sideways action. This time is a bit different. The coin is already working on a 7th consecutive green week and there is an obvious RSI-divergence concern to boot with RSI-14 quickly approaching overbought. Investor Takeaways While I don't think this BTC rally is over quite yet, I'm definitely getting a sense that we may be quickly careening to the peak for this cycle. Based on indicators that I follow, I wouldn't rule out a rally up to $120-125k BTC before we see a deep pullback in the coin. There are a variety of ways one can express that bullish BTC belief. My personal choice is FBTC. But there is no doubt that IBIT is the clear favorite among the spot ETFs in the US market. The fund has a competitive expense ratio, tremendous liquidity, and brand recognition. It also happens to be the outlier fund so far in 2025. Most of the spot ETFs have actually endured BTC-denominated outflow so far this year and IBIT currently controls more BTC supply than the rest of the funds combined. I'm of the view that this rally is getting close to its conclusion for this halving cycle. This coin goes as capital flows go and there is no question IBIT is acting like a BTC sponge - or as Pac-Man if you like that analogy better.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4789087-ibit-full-pac-man-at-all-time-highs?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","BTC-USD|IBIT",cryptocompare
2025-05-22T11:55:37.000Z,"FBI, SEC, and DOJ take down startup CEO in $1M crypto meltdown","The US Attorney for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) on Wednesday charged Jeremy Jordan-Jones, a self-styled blockchain founder, accused of defrauding investors out of $1 million. He got indicted on wire fraud, securities fraud, making false statements to a bank, and identity theft. If convicted, Jones faces a maximum of 72 years in prison, though actual sentencing will be decided by a judge. The FBI and SEC have both played key roles in the investigation. However, the commission is also filing a parallel civil action. The case is being handled by the US Attorney’s Securities and Commodities Task Force. FBI and DOJ slam Amalgam Capital executive Jordan-Jones ran Amalgam Capital Ventures, a startup that he claimed was building cutting-edge point-of-sale and blockchain payment tech. He went on to boast about “big league” partnerships and breakthrough blockchain products, but prosecutors say the whole thing was a sham. He even showed off mockups of functioning software and claimed the firm was preparing to list a native token on global exchanges. The DOJ says Amalgam had no working products, zero real partnerships, and barely any customers. Meanwhile, Jordan-Jones was faking bank statements and submitting phony financials to secure investments and loans. The indictment alleges that Jones used investor money to bankroll his personal lifestyle, leaving backers with empty wallets and zero returns. By late 2022, Amalgam folded, and investors were left holding the bag. He is now facing multiple federal charges, including aggravated identity theft, which is a serious count that carries a mandatory 2-year prison term on top of any other sentence. Clayton calls out tech-driven frauds The release stated that investors’ funds were siphoned off to bankroll Jones’s lavish lifestyle. US Attorney Jay Clayton summed it up and stated that, “This should be an example to would-be financial fraudsters that the women and men of the Southern District and the FBI are watching and to the investing public that fraudsters often use the promise of new technology to cloak their schemes.” Clayton has served as the US SEC chairman from May 2017 to December 2020. During his time, the commission brought over 2,300 enforcement actions. This resulted in over $10 billion in fines while returning more than $3 billion to harmed investors. Clayton led the SEC when it sued Ripple Labs in December 2020. Recently, Ripple announced that the watchdog has dropped its lawsuit against the company. As the crypto scams make their way through the investing public, the FBI’s annual report revealed that the IC3 received more than 140k complaints referencing cryptocurrency in 2024, which has resulted in around $9.3 billion in losses. Amid all the frauds and scams, the global digital assets market has hit the $3.5 trillion cap. The biggest crypto, Bitcoin , went on to register its new all-time high of $111,800 on Thursday. BTC is trading at an average price of $110,845 as of press time.

2025-05-22T11:50:48.000Z,"Top 5 Altcoins to Buy As Bitcoin Hits New ATH!","The post Top 5 Altcoins to Buy As Bitcoin Hits New ATH! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market today has forayed into a new phase of bullish momentum, driven by Bitcoin’s historic surge to a new all-time high beyond $111,000. This rally has pushed the total crypto market cap to an impressive $3.5 trillion, a 4.5% increase. Meanwhile, daily trading volume has soared to $197.45 billion, marking a sharp 53.67% rise. BTC dominance currently sits at 62.9%, and is expected to fade based on past experiences, and many believe the tide to altseason is about to return. Among the top contenders poised for strong performance are Ethereum, Solana, XRP, Chainlink, and SUI. Top 5 Altcoins to Buy Ethereum (ETH): Ethereum has shown a notable 5.15% gain in the last 24 hours, taking its price to $2662.56. Its run is fueled by a sharp increase in volume to $37.92 billion, a jump of nearly 65%. ETH’s recent rally represents a 50% increase from its pre-Pectra upgrade days, and many analysts expect this upward trend to continue. The price appears poised to break through the $3000 level in the coming weeks. Check out our Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! Solana (SOL): Solana is once again grabbing the spotlight with a 6.38% price surge since yesterday, taking its price to $178.72. Trading activity has intensified, with daily volume rising by more than 72% to $6.24 billion. Solana’s 2021 bull run performance, where it delivered a 100x return, continues to resonate with investors. With strong community support, an expanding DeFi ecosystem, and high-speed capabilities, SOL could soon reclaim the $200 mark. Technical indicators suggest that price targets of $220 and even $250 are within reach. XRP: XRP price has seen a 4.20% rise in the past 24 hours, changing hands at $2.43 after ranging between $2.34 and $2.45. Volume has also jumped to $4.29 billion, up over 43%. The renewed bullishness around XRP is supported by a surge in open interest, which now sits at $4.69 billion, and the fact that XRP futures are outperforming Ethereum ETFs. On a technical level, the XRP/BTC chart shows bullish RSI divergence, suggesting a potential reversal is near. In a bullish case, XRP could defy odds to hit $3 soon, as seen on the XRP/TetherUS chart. Chainlink (LINK): Chainlink, aka LINK price, is up 6.66% to $16.64 over the past day. Its price was assisted by a volume increase of nearly 63% to $784.63 million. LINK is expected to do good, thanks to its critical role as a decentralized oracle provider, integral for the functionality of DeFi, insurance protocols, gaming platforms, and real-world asset tokenization. Additionally, Chainlink staking has added a compelling incentive for long-term holders, with competitive yields attracting both retail and institutional interest. If LINK can break through resistance at $17.40, a move toward $19.80 is the next technical target. SUI SUI is rising as a standout in the Layer-1 category, posting a strong 8.98% gain over the past 24 hours to reach $4.18. It has traded in the range of $3.84 to $4.19, with volume spiking by nearly 74% to $2.14 billion. Backed by increasing development activity and rising social volume, SUI appears well-positioned for a breakout. Analysts are optimistic about its potential to reclaim its previous high of $5.37 and even eye $11. Also read our SUI Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! FAQs Is now a good time to invest in altcoins? Yes, with Bitcoin hitting new highs and its market dominance expected to decline, altcoins are likely to outperform in the short to mid-term. When will altseason start? Now that Bitcoin has created a new ATH with a price surge of over 10%, we can expect an altseason once BTC dominance falls below 60%. What altcoins should I buy? Considering the current trends, one can opt for blue-chip cryptos such as Ethereum, Solana, XRP, Chainlink, and SUI.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/top-5-altcoins-to-buy-as-bitcoin-hits-new-ath/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|LINK|TRADING","Price Analysis|Altcoins",cryptocompare

On May 22, blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain reported that a crypto wallet spent $3.8 million to purchase 1,425 Ether ( ETH ) at $2,670 per coin, reentering ETH after a major rally. On April 13, the same wallet sold 2,522 ETH for $3.9 million, when the asset was trading at about $1,570, a decision that, in retrospect, looks poorly timed. “Think twice before selling your bags,” Lookonchain wrote, highlighting the potential gains if the trader just held on to their Ether instead of selling and repurchasing it at a higher price point. Whale buys ETH after selling over a month ago. Source: DeBank Trader loses out on $2.67 million gain With ETH up over 70% since the sale, the trader lost out on over 1,000 ETH, or roughly $2.67 million, in the process of buying back in. If the trader had decided to hold on to their Ether, the assets would be worth about $6.7 million. As ETH rallied, the asset surpassed the market capitalization of big companies like Coca-Cola and Alibaba. At the time of writing, company data tracker 8marketcap shows that Ether’s $321 billion market capitalization makes it the 38th most-valuable asset in the world, surpassing the pharmaceutical company AbbVie and inching closer to the Bank of America. Ether’s upswing was largely fueled by the successful launch of its Pectra upgrade . The update improved the network’s scalability, validator user experience and smart-wallet functionality. These updates are expected to drive broader adoption of the Ethereum mainnet.

A May 19 report from digital asset manager CoinShares revealed that US crypto investment products saw $785 million in inflows last week. This development pushes the year-to-date (YTD) total for crypto ETPs to $7.5 billion. ETH was the top performer among the crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs), attracting $205 million in inflows last week. This represented 26% of all the inflows within the time period. This also brought ETH’s YTD total to over $575 million. The CoinShares report attributed the increased inflows to renewed investor optimism following the Pectra upgrade and also the Ethereum Foundation’s appointment of Tomasz Stańczak as a co-executive director.

2025-05-22T11:45:49.000Z,"BTC and XRP bull run starts, boosting the viral Bitcoin Pepe","Most crypto majors, including Ethereum, Ripple, and Solana, have recorded significant gains after Bitcoin hit a fresh all-time high earlier on Thursday. With Bitcoin bulls now eyeing the next target at $120,000, investors are looking for opportunities to activate their Bitcoin capital. Bitcoin Pepe , the first meme ICO on the Bitcoin network gives crypto enthusiasts a chance to rake in hefty gains from Bitcoin’s uptrend and the broader crypto bull run of 2025. With slightly over a week left to the announced CEX listing, it is no wonder investors are rushing to amass some BPEP tokens at the currently affordable price of $0.0359. Bitcoin hits fresh all-time high as market sentiment improves Bitcoin price remains on an uptrend, holding steady above the psychologically crucial zone of $110,000. In fact, as seen on its daily chart, the crypto major formed the bullish three white soldiers pattern; bolstering Bitcoin price to a new all-time high of $111,881 in early Thursday session. The risk-on mood has kept the bulls in control with the crypto fear & greed index rising from the previous session’s greed level of 68 to 69. After a period of consolidation, Bitcoin price has regained the bullish momentum to break the resistance around $106,600. In the short term, I expect Bitcoin price to continue soaring as investors move from the sidelines and buy. The most likely scenario is where it rises to $120,000 by the end of the week.

With the presale slated to end on 31st May, crypto enthusiasts are rushing to amass some BPEP tokens before the price skyrockets. It has become one of the highly talked-about projects in the meme crypto space. In addition to the limited time, confirmation of CEX listing has further bolstered the project’s virality and subsequent FOMO. So far, the project has raised over $10 million, with over $1 million in just a week. As Bitcoin’s market cap remains steady above $2 trillion, investors are looking for opportunities to benefit from the uptrend and the broader crypto bull run of 2025. Being the first meme ICO on the Bitcoin network, Bitcoin Pepe is an ideal investment opportunity. What’s more, with its robust growth potential, its current token price of $0.0359 will likely be the lowest it will ever get to moving forward. Ripple price defies upside limit as XRP ETFs launch XRP price chart | Source: TradingView For more than a week now, Ripple price has been under pressure as the market processes the recent rejection of the joint agreement request by Ripple Labs and SEC. However, with the improved risk-on mood and launch of XRP futures ETF, the altcoin rallied to a one-week high in early Thursday session. Data from CoinMarketCap showed a price increase of 2.61% over the past 24 hours. Besides, its trading volume has surged by 45.56%. An increase in trading volume usually signals heightened investor interest. A look at its four-hour price chart shows the 25 and 50-day EMAs converging at the support zone of $2.3865. In the near term, I expect the altcoin to hold steady above that zone with $2.4550 being the resistance level to beat. Beyond that zone, the bulls will have cleared their path to the psychologically crucial level of $2.5000. The bulls remain in control for as long as Ripple price continues to trade above $2.3434.

A filing with the Maine Attorney General’s Office outlines the massive scope of the breach, which happened in late December but was not discovered by Coinbase until earlier this month. The exchange says criminals bribed a small group of overseas customer support agents to copy the data of less than 1% of the firm’s monthly transacting users. Coinbase notes that hacked information includes names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, masked social security numbers (the last 4 digits only), masked bank-account numbers, some bank account identifiers, government-ID images, account data and limited corporate data. The exchange says impacted customers were notified by email on May 15th. Coinbase learned about the hack after receiving an email earlier this month demanding a $20 million Bitcoin ( BTC ) payoff in exchange for not releasing the illegally obtained info. The company refused to give in to the hackers’ demand and estimates it will pay $180 million to $400 million in remediation costs and voluntary customer reimbursements. In a video posted to the social media platform X, Coinbase chief executive Brian Armstrong promised the exchange would pay back impacted customers, increase cyberattack defenses and relocate certain overseas customer support operations.

2025-05-22T11:39:03.000Z,"Why Are Bitcoin Traders Aggressively Shorting as BTC Hits New Record High?","Bitcoin {BTC} galloped to a new record high above $110,000 on Thursday, liquidating around $500 million worth of derivatives positions in its wake, but some traders aren't buying into the bullish sentiment. Trading volume jumped by 74% in the past 24 hours as traders attempted to position themselves, however the majority of these traders are opting to go short -- or bet on bitcoin moving downwards. Coinalyze data shows that the long/short ratio is at its lowest point since September 2022, which was the midst of crypto winter. This trend began on April 21 as traders aggressively shorted the breakout above $85,000, seemingly under the impression that bitcoin had already formed its cycle high and that any subsequent move would form a double top. However, despite a lack of retail participation , bitcoin continued to grind higher, taking out levels of resistance at $97,000 and $105,000 on its path. The move can be attributed to a number of factors; a recovery in U.S. equities as tariff concerns cooled, a rise in institutional activity on exchanges, like the CME, and crucially a wealth of short positions to squeeze and force prices higher. While these short positions might be considered bearish in terms of market structure, they are actually fanning the flame to the upside as it gives bullish traders areas to target and conduct stop-loss hunts like we saw earlier this week. Shorting an asset's record high is not necessarily a bad strategy; a trader will often opt to enter a short position at a level of resistance, whether that be technical or psychological, and layer stop losses above where the thesis of a short trade would be invalidated. In this case, if a trader shorted $105,000 on each of BTCs three tests of that area, they could have closed their position in profit on three occasions at $102,000, meaning that even if they were stopped out of the trade at $109,000, it would be a profitable week. Alongside the continued rise in short positions we have seen open interest jump disproportionately to BTC. Over the past 24 hours BTC is up 4.8% while open interest is up by 17% despite hundreds of million being liquidated. This indicates that the record high break is driven by leverage and might be less sustainable that the initial drives above $100,000 in December and January. It remains to be seen whether interest in short positions continues to rise if BTC rolls on with its momentous move above $111,000, but there is certainly a minefield of short positions to squeeze if it needs some ammunition.

2025-05-22T11:36:08.000Z,"Trump Adviser David Sacks Says Stablecoin Bill Set to Pass Senate – Could Unlock Trillions for U.S. Treasuries","David Sacks, senior crypto adviser to President Donald Trump, announced on May 21 that bipartisan momentum is propelling the GENIUS Actlandmark stablecoin legislation through the U.S. Senate. The bill, which aims to bring regulatory clarity to a $200 billion stablecoin market, has cleared an important procedural hurdle with the support of 15 Democrats , making its passage highly likely. Sacks framed the bill as a long-overdue regulatory fix and a geopolitical and financial inflection point. He argued that by legitimizing dollar-pegged digital assets under federal law, the legislation could dramatically increase global demand for U.S. Treasuries, potentially injecting trillions of dollars into the American financial system. White House crypto czar David Sacks says stablecoin bill will unlock 'trillions' for U.S. Treasury https://t.co/SfOw09ZRAq — CNBC (@CNBC) May 21, 2025 “We already have over $200 billion in stablecoins—it’s just unregulated,” Sacks told CNBC. “If we provide the legal clarity and framework for this, I think we could create trillions of dollars of demand for our Treasuries practically overnight.” Generally known as the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act , the bill is the most advanced federal effort to date to establish legal guardrails for stablecoins. If passed, it would authorize the issuance of stablecoins fully backed by U.S. dollars or Treasuries, subject to licensing and reserve requirements under federal oversight. Trump Ties and Political Tension Cloud Stablecoin Bill Momentum While the bill’s technical merits have drawn rare bipartisan support, controversy continues to swirl around potential conflicts of interest. Critics point to the Trump family’s ties to World Liberty Financial , a crypto firm recently launching its stablecoin, USD1, which U.S. Treasuries and fiat reserves reportedly back. The token has secured a $2 billion investment commitment from Abu Dhabi’s MGX fund via Binance, raising questions about whether the administration’s policy initiatives are aligned with private family investments. Sacks, who says he divested $200 million in crypto holdings before joining the administration, declined to comment on whether Trump or his family stands to benefit from the bill’s passage. Trump's AI and Crypto Czar @DavidSacks confirmed he sold all direct crypto holdings before the President’s administration began. #DavidSacks #CryptoRegulation https://t.co/TpZaVpYl1J — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 3, 2025 When pressed on the ethics of presidential crypto ventures, he avoided specifics, instead emphasizing the bill’s transformative economic potential. Still, the GENIUS Act’s path to final passage isn’t entirely smooth. Senator Josh Hawley recently added a provision capping credit card late fees amendment that could alienate key financial industry backers and complicate the coalition needed to pass the bill. Yield-Bearing Stablecoins Signal Industry Shift Meanwhile, the broader stablecoin ecosystem is evolving rapidly. Once considered regulatory gray zones, yield-bearing stablecoins are gaining legitimacy under the Trump administration’s regulatory shift. In February, the SEC approved such tokens as “certificates” governed under securities laws rather than banning them. This move opened the door to compliant products offering interest to stablecoin holders, provided they meet disclosure, registration, and investor protection standards. This move is backed by the growing momentum around the stablecoins. Yield-bearing stablecoins surged to $11 billion in circulation from just $1.5 billion at the start of 2024, now accounting for 4.5% of the total stablecoin supply . Stablecoin supply reaches $200B, signaling increased liquidity across exchanges. Historical patterns suggest this could impact $BTC and broader #CryptoMarkets . #Blockchain #Stablecoins https://t.co/uiSRxnoEtz — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 31, 2025 Decentralized protocols like Pendle have emerged as primary beneficiaries. Pendle, which allows users to lock in fixed yields or speculate on variable interest rates, currently holds nearly $3 billion in total value locked (TVL) from yield-bearing stablecoins, making up 30% of the sector’s TVL. Stablecoins now represent 83% of Pendle’s total TVLup, up from less than 20% a year ago, while traditional assets like ETH have fallen to under 10%. This shift indicates growing user preference for stablecoin-based yield opportunities at a time when traditional tokens remain volatile and the Federal Reserve maintains high interest rates. While dominant, legacy stablecoins such as USDT and USDC still do not pass on yield to holders. With over $200 billion in circulation and Fed rates hovering at 4.3%, Pendle estimates that stablecoin holders forgo more than $9 billion in annual interest.

2025-05-22T11:30:13.000Z,"Ripple CEO snubbed by Lummis: XRP FUD Fuels crypto drama","On May 19, 2025, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse revealed on X that his high-stakes meeting with Sen. Cynthia Lummis, chair of the Digital Assets Subcommittee, was abruptly canceled, sending shockwaves through Crypto X. Speculation erupted, with many pointing to Lummis’ son-in-law, Will Cole—a vocal Bitcoin maximalist known for reposting anti-Ripple content—as a potential influence behind the snub, fueling fresh waves of XRP FUD. The timing of this cancelled meeting only fuels the fire as it coincides with the alleged behind-the-scenes negotiation between Circle and Ripple, with the latter attempting to buy the former. Another company interested in buying Circle is Coinbase, a company that gets along with Lummis better, according to observers. Ripple has the money to bid for Circle solely due to dumping XRP. They are trying to buy Circle because stablecoins make the usecase XRP was supposed to fulfil utterly useless. They know this, they've known it for years while they dumped billions of dollars worth of XRP on… https://t.co/qV28WzPzHC — Rex (@R89Capital) May 20, 2025 Ripple critics again alleged that the real reason behind buying Circle is dumping XRP coins in exchange for fiat money. Ripple is an American company behind one of the top five cryptocurrencies, XRP. From the start, Ripple took a path different from the mainstream anti-banking ethos of the crypto community. XRP was supposed to be a cryptocurrency integrated into the traditional banking system. XRP is in control of Ripple. It has high transaction speed and network capacity; however, many doubt that Ripple can be called decentralized. The company was founded by Jed McCaleb and Chris Larsen. Brad Garlinghouse became CEO in 2016. Possible reasons for meeting cancellation Lummis is hands down one of the most prominent pro-crypto U.S. lawmakers of the 2020s. As the CEO of one of the biggest cryptocurrency brands, Ripple, Garlinghouse believed he would be involved in the high-profile stakes discussion over stablecoin legislation in the US. However, it seems the CEO is being ghosted by the regulatory circle around Lummis, with observers noting that there may be a rift forming between the two. Garlinghouse himself took to X to voice these concerns. Heading to DC to champion sensible pro-crypto legislation around stablecoins and market structure, and I’m very encouraged to see our elected officials look at crypto as it should be – a multichain industry. That said, @SenLummis , as Chair of the Digital Assets Subcommittee,… — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) May 19, 2025 There may be many reasons for the cancellation of this meeting. One of the first things that comes to mind is that these days the Senate turned into a battlespace around the Genius Act, a bill aimed to create a framework for the U.S. stablecoin issuers. The bill was blocked by the Senate Democrats earlier this month. Lummis and her colleagues in the Senate were working for two weeks to make amendments to win the Democrats’ vote on May 20, when the Senate voted on the latest iteration of the bill, right after the planned meeting with Garlinghouse. You might also like: Senator Lummis claims Trump supports 1M Bitcoin strategic reserve bill Ripple advocates pointed to a different motive beyond a mere scheduling conflict, suspecting that Sen.

Rochard believes that the company is selling its coin XRP all the time to get revenue. It makes him think that Ripple is kind of a centralized fraud company that creates XRP coins out of thin air and sells them in exchange for fiat money. Bitcoin purists voice similar accusations against Ethereum as well. I will continue to speak out against Ripple XRP, it’s not a real blockchain and it’s not decentralized.

The central bank-issued cryptocurrencies are an approach that has become mainstream in Europe. The GOP, however, opposes a digital dollar and prefers stablecoins issued by the companies, as they don’t compromise operational privacy. Read more: Senate crypto bill collapses: Is partisan divide or Trump’s digital fortune to blame? Pierre Rochard himself points to the pro-Democrat sentiment of Ripple’s co-founder Chris Larsen, who donated $10 million worth of XRP to Kamala Harris when she was running for the office. This donation made Larsen the biggest individual sponsor of the Harris. Larsen explained in the X post that he believes Harris will ensure that American technology will dominate the world. Garlinghouse distanced himself from the support for Harris, but emphasized that the Biden-era approach to crypto should be changed for a better one. The fact of the donation became another reason to accuse Ripple of dumping its coins in bulk. https://twitter.com/Hexologist31/status/1848410473575649766 While it is clear why Cole or like-minded people sharply oppose Ripple, it is still not clear why Sen. Lummis should cancel the meeting with Garlinghouse based on her political leanings. While criticism persists, Ripple continues to struggle legally, as on May 15, a judge denied the SEC settlement, which could help Ripple solve its problems. It seems that 2025 is a harder year for Ripple than for many other U.S. crypto giants.

Accordingly, Michigan lawmakers have introduced four bills regarding cryptocurrencies. Michigan lawmakers have introduced four new bills related to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, according to Decrypt. The new bills in Michigan would allow Bitcoin retirement investments, ban state CBDC backing, and offer tax breaks for crypto mining in oil fields. House Bill 4510 aims to allow public pension funds to invest in Bitcoin through regulated ETF products, provided that the funds have an average market value of at least $250 billion over the past year. House Bill 4511 seeks to prohibit government agencies from supporting or promoting a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC). The bill aims to block government support for a U.S. central bank CBDC and prohibit government agencies from any licensing, taxation, or official advocacy of CBDCs. Bills 4512 and 4513 focus on encouraging BTC mining in abandoned oil wells and offer tax incentives to companies that engage in such operations for environmental remediation. As you may recall, in recent weeks, the US state of New Hampshire has signed a first in the US and approved a bill allowing crypto investments. *This is not investment advice.

However, ownership declined, falling to 29% in 2025 from 40% the previous year, according to Independent Reserve’s fifth annual Singapore Crypto Market Survey released on May 21. The survey, conducted in February with 1,500 participants, revealed that men remain more active in crypto investing than women, 35% compared to 24%. Millennials and Gen X (aged 25–54) dominate the investor base, comprising 71% of all holders. Among those trading at least once a week, 76% fall into this age group.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) continues to be the anchor of the crypto market in Singapore. It is held by 68% of crypto investors and viewed by 86% as either a currency, store of value or investment asset. Notably, 77% say Bitcoin will be worth over $100,000 by 2030. Direct ownership remains the preferred method of exposure, with 61% choosing to hold their assets directly instead of through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) . Arbitrage trading is also on the rise, with 67% of respondents saying they had sold part or all of their holdings to capitalize on price swings in the past year.

2025-05-22T11:18:29.000Z,"Hyperliquid Soars As Open Interest Hits Record High — Is $HYPE Set For A New ATH?","The post Hyperliquid Soars As Open Interest Hits Record High — Is $HYPE Set For A New ATH? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Key Highlights: Hyperliquid’s open interest surged to $997.5M, its highest ever (CoinGlass). HYPE price spiked 22% in 7 days, now trading at $30.72. RSI at 76.76 and MACD crossover indicate overbought momentum (TradingView). OBV and CMF reflect rising accumulation and strong capital inflow (Chart data). Whale suffered $18.88M loss on a 5x short, highlighting bullish dominance (Lookonchain). Analyst Bias: Cautiously bullish; continuation likely if $32.67 is breached with volume. With Open Interest nearing $1B and HYPE breaking past $30, traders are watching for a breakout to retest the $35 ATH. Whale liquidations and strong on-chain metrics are signalling continued upside. HYPE/USDT Price Analysis: Resistance Levels in Sight Hyperliquid coin has shown strong bullish momentum this month, surging nearly 96% from its April low. The rally began after a prolonged downtrend that started around Feb 22 , when HYPE traded just below $18 and slid to a cycle low of $15.70 by April 8 — marking a ~15% drop. This downtrend established a critical support zone between $15.70 and $18.00 , which served as the springboard for the rally. From there, HYPE reversed strongly, climbing nearly 96% to its current price of $30.72 . Now, the token is approaching the $32.67–$35.00 resistance zone , aligning with both its December ATH and the whale liquidation mark. RSI at 78.20 confirms overbought territory, signalling strong bullish momentum. MACD has crossed above its signal line, and Bollinger Bands are widening, with price hugging the upper band — all supportive of trend continuation. The EMA stack (20/50/100/200) is in perfect bullish alignment. HYPE remains well above the 20-day EMA, now a key support near $28.20 . Holding this level suggests strength in buying dips. Volume & Capital Flows: Bulls in Control Capital flow indicators further validate the uptrend. CMF at +0.30 signals robust inflows, while OBV is rising after months of decline — a clear indicator of renewed net accumulation. This confluence adds weight to the bullish case for a breakout above $32.67. Momentum strongly favors bulls, but entries at current levels carry higher risk due to stretched indicators. A volume-backed breakout above $32.67 or a retracement toward $28.20–$25.10 could offer stronger entry points. Bulls remain in control unless $25 breaks down. On-Chain Metrics: Volume Surge and Whale Liquidations Open Interest has now reached $997.57M (as of May 22), suggesting increased leverage and directional bets — sourced from CoinGlass . Perpetual volume is surging alongside DEX activity, with Hyperliquid leading OI dominance across platforms. According to Artemis Terminal , DEX trading volume has surged 97.4% month-over-month , while daily protocol revenue climbed to $3.1M , up from ~$2.1M a few weeks ago. Daily transactions are holding above 429.4M , reinforcing consistent usage. Whale activity is also shaping sentiment: As per Lookonchain , on May 22, a whale took a 5x leveraged short against HYPE, posting 2.05M USDC — only to face an $18.88M unrealized loss , with liquidation looming at $32.67 . Data from Mitrade also highlighted another whale placing a $830M BTC long at 40x leverage on Hyperliquid, reflecting increasing platform confidence. These whale movements — both failed shorts and bullish long entries — support the current uptrend in HYPE’s structure. Conclusion: ATH in Sight, But Momentum Must Hold Hyperliquid’s native token HYPE, is experiencing a textbook breakout scenario, backed by strong technicals and on-chain activity. With leverage piling up and whale shorts getting punished, the path to retesting $35 looks increasingly probable. However, traders should monitor the $32.67 zone closely. A breakout above this level with rising volume could flip it into support and trigger a new ATH. Failure to breach may invite consolidation toward $28.20 or even $25.10. Bullish bias remains intact while above $28.20. A breakout above $32.67 confirms upside continuation.

2025-05-22T11:17:27.000Z,"Why Is Crypto Up Today? – May 22, 2025","The bull is running. All top 10 coins and nearly all 100 coins per market cap saw their prices rise in the last 24 hours as a result of the ongoing crypto ETF positive flows and regulatory advancements, particularly in the stablecoin sector. At the same time, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has increased by 1.1% to $3.61 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $198 billion, the highest we’ve seen in weeks. TLDR: The crypto market rally continues as BTC hits fresh all-time highs; The bull market boosts investor confidence, sentiment, spending, and profit; Rally has more room to extend; ‘Pullbacks should be seen as entry opportunities—not signs of reversal’; Spot Bitcoin ETFs see a net inflow of $608.99 million; The rally remains sustainable, though pullbacks and short-term corrections are possible. Crypto Winners & Losers All top 10 coins per market cap have appreciated over the past day. Cardano (ADA) is the day’s best performer, for the second day in a row. It’s up 3.6% to $0.7876. Bitcoin (BTC) follows with a rise of 3.4%, currently trading at $111,187. The world’s number one coin has been testing new all-time highs for several hours now. At the time of writing, its highest local and all-time price is $111,544. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) appreciated 0.9%, now changing hands at $2,623. It’s daily high is $2,631, the same level as yesterday. Furthermore, of the top 100 coins, only seven are red today, all with decreases between Maker (MKR)’s 0.6% and Aave (AAVE)’s 3.4%. The two trade at $1,762 and $252, respectively. The rally drivers remain the same: it’s a powerful combination of significant surge in crypto exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) inflows and favorable regulatory developments, further boosted by the somewhat improved US-China trade sentiment and a US sovereign debt credit downgrade by Moody’s. As a result, risk capital has been diverted back into crypto. The sector seems to be winning a battle towards clearer regulations. The US Senate has voted to advance the GENIUS Act . Blockchain Association Interim CEO and Head of Policy, Sarah Milby, described the move as “a meaningful step toward establishing clear, common sense rules for stablecoins.” 2/ With this vote, Congress has signaled that the United States is serious about leading the future of digital finance – where trust, innovation, and dollar dominance intersect. — Blockchain Association (@BlockchainAssn) May 20, 2025 Crypto investment firm Bitwise CEO Matt Hougan has argued that the Act will legitimize mainstream stablecoin usage and propel this section of the market from $236 billion to $2.5 trillion .

The Short-Term Holder cohort’s percentage of supply in profit increasing by more than 7% over the last month – the second-largest positive uptick in profitability for this cohort on record. The fresh ATH will provide additional fuel. Source: Glassnode All investor cohorts have seen improvement in their financial position. “This likely has the knock-on effect” of boosting investor confidence, sentiment, and spending, Glassnode says. “As market conditions improve, and investor portfolios recover, many are taking the opportunity to lock in profits.” Source: Glassnode The analyst team from the crypto exchange Bitfinex commented how Bitcoin has just reclaimed new all-time highs, breaking above the $109.5,000 level “with conviction and volume.” They stated that the move was a squeeze at first. The price moved up on short liquidations, and the first break could be reversed on lower timeframes. However, the rally from 75,000 onwards has been driven by “clean spot demand, ETF inflows, and a macro backdrop that continues to favour risk-on assets.” Per the team, “The recent geopolitical de-escalation (Russia–Ukraine), dovish undertones from global central banks, and softening inflation prints have all created an ideal environment for Bitcoin to act as a macro momentum asset.” Furthermore, the analysts noted stable funding rates, CVDs showing strong spot-led flows, and consistent ETF inflows, especially during US hours. “This is not leverage-driven,” the analysts argue. “It’s structurally bid. With open interest now rising alongside price (rather than front-running it), there’s room for this move to stretch further”. Levels & Events to Watch Next After briefly dipping its finger to test the all-time waters, BTC surged and surpassed the $109,900 level, followed by $110,000, and finally $111,100. How long it will be able to sustain it remains to be seen, but it has made significant long-term strides regardless of possible pullbacks. Per the Bitfinex analysts, the next zone to watch is $114,00–$118,000 as minor liquidity walls. After that, the next step is the $123,000–$125,000 zone, where large options open interest is building. “As long as ETF flows hold and macro doesn’t deliver a shock, this rally has room to extend. Pullbacks should be seen as entry opportunities—not signs of reversal.” Moreover, the Fear and Greed Index has jumped from 69 to 73 in a day, showcasing increased greed, rising investor confidence, boosted optimism, and a general willingness to take risks.

The cumulative total net inflow reached $43.38 billion. Also, spot Ethereum ETFs recorded $587,130 in net inflows, for a fourth day of positive flows, resulting in the cumulative inflow of $2.59 billion. Furthermore, as crypto rallied, decentralized trading platform Hyperliquid saw open interest climb to a record $8.9 billion.

Today, US President Donald Trump will host top investors in the TRUMP meme coin at a gala in Washington, DC. This is just one of unethical moves Trump has made, critics say, given that the coin potentially enables foreign influences to buy his favor, giving them direct access to the president. This may also reflect on the market, so it’s something to keep an eye on, especially given the support some crypto insiders have given this endeavor. Honored to support @POTUS and grateful for the invitation from @GetTrumpMemes to attend President Trump’s Gala Dinner as his TOP fan!

Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) May 20, 2025 Quick FAQ Why did crypto move against stocks today? As the crypto market rallies, the stock market records a notable drop. The S&P 500 is down 1.61%, the Nasdaq-100 fell 1.34%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average saw a decrease of 1.91%. Investors are turning to assets like crypto and gold due to the rising concerns over rising Treasury yields, inflation, and interest rate hikes. Furthermore, Trump is pushing to pass a tax-cut bill that could add between $3 trillion and $5 trillion to the $36.2 trillion government debt. Is this rally sustainable? The rally remains strong for now. It has found strong support in institutional demand, fueled by macroeconomic conditions. That said, pullbacks are likely, while the growing greed could lead to short-term downward corrections.

2025-05-22T11:16:09.000Z,"Bitcoin ETF Inflows Soar as IBIT Posts Biggest Daily Surge in 2 Weeks","BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, has posted its largest single-day inflow in over two weeks, attracting over half a billion dollars on May 21 as Bitcoin continues to soar toward new all-time highs . With traders increasingly allocating capital to spot Bitcoin ETFs, market excitement appears to be intensifying amid a broader crypto rally. According to data from Farside Investors, IBIT brought in a staggering $530.6 million in net inflows on Tuesday—its biggest haul since May 5, when it collected $531.2 million. The fund has now avoided a single outflow since April 9, solidifying its status as a dominant player in the Bitcoin ETF landscape. Perhaps even more striking is the rate at which IBIT is absorbing Bitcoin . In just one day, the fund acquired 4,931 BTC—more than ten times the 450 BTC that were mined over the same 24-hour period. This level of accumulation reflects strong institutional demand and suggests that many are betting on further price appreciation. Bitcoin ETF Volume Surge Mirrors BTC Breakout The explosive inflow was matched by a surge in trading activity. IBIT recorded its busiest trading day since January, according to market tracker Trader T. The ETF Store president, Nate Geraci, noted that the strong volume could indicate even more inflows in the days to come. “Given trading volume today, expect these inflow numbers to increase,” he commented. In total, the eleven U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETF funds recorded $607.1 million in net inflows on May 21. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) took the second-highest share with $23.5 million in new capital. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas described the scene as a “classic feeding frenzy,” fueled by Bitcoin’s price rally, which pushed the cryptocurrency to nearly $112,000 in early May 22 trading. Balchunas pointed out that ETF volumes haven’t reached such levels since January, when Bitcoin was hovering near its then all-time high. “Most ETFs are going to see 2x their average flows incoming,” he said, hinting at a potentially sustained wave of investment. Continued Momentum Amid Rate Speculation? Industry experts believe the ETF inflow trend may still be in its early stages. Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE, noted that Bitcoin ETFs have already attracted $3.6 billion in net inflows this month alone. He emphasized that investor interest could accelerate further if the Federal Reserve signals upcoming interest rate cuts. Meanwhile, Jupiter Zheng, partner at HashKey Capital, said Bitcoin’s breakout above $110,000 puts the asset into “uncharted price discovery territory.” He warned of heightened volatility ahead but added that ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and economic instability could push more investors toward Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. As institutional capital continues to pour into spot Bitcoin ETF products , the crypto market may be getting ready for even greater opportunity.

2025-05-22T11:15:00.000Z,"Crypto Daybook Americas: All Signs Point Up as Bitcoin Hits Record High","By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin BTC surpassed Wednesday's record to reach an all-time high of $111,875 in the early hours of Thursday, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index , as traditional financial markets contended with rising bond yields and renewed concerns over ballooning U.S. debt. The largest cryptocurrency has gained around 3.8% in the last 24 hours while the broader CoinDesk 20 CD20 index rose 4.74%, continuing a trend of strength driven by mounting institutional demand and growing interest in crypto exposure. The rally is unfolding against a backdrop of higher yields on U.S. and Japanese government bonds. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose to 4.6%, while the 30-year topped 5%, driven by concerns over President Donald Trump’s tax bill that analysts estimate could add as much as $5 trillion to the country’s debt, according to Reuters. In Japan, yields on 30- and 40-year government bonds also hit record highs. The country’s debt-to-GDP ratio stands at 234%, QCP Capital said , and growing scrutiny coupled with weak demand for long-dated JGBs sent yields soaring. That matters because higher yields — and thus higher returns — on investments that are considered relatively safe tend to lower the appeal of riskier assets like stocks, not to mention cryptocurrencies. While BTC, with its history of trading as a risky asset, hasn't shown much sign of ebbing demand, it raises the question of how long the rally can continue. Still, traders have been building large long positions in BTC options, with the most open interest now concentrated at the $110,000, $120,000 and even $300,000 calls for contracts expiring in late June in a sign of continuing bullish conviction. U.S.-traded spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds have also been seeing significant demand. Total net inflows hit $1.6 billion over the week, and $4.24 billion so far in May, SoSoValue data shows. The inflows, coupled with bitcoin’s price rise, have seen the ETFs' total net assets hit a record $129 billion. There are, however, some muted signs of bearish activity. “The largest block flow this week continues to be ETH December call spreads, while overnight BTC butterfly positions hint that some traders are positioning for consolidation around current levels,” Wintermute OTC trader Jake O. said. Note, he's talking about consolidation, not declines. And traditional participants may even be too bearish. While the U.S. endured a recent credit downgrade, markets are now pricing in a 6-level cut all the way down to BBB+. On top of that, per Jake O., a recent equities market sell-off may not be a result of repositioning given higher bond yields, but rather profit-taking after nine consecutive positive sessions.

Pseudonymous trader James Wynn opened a $1.1 billion long on BTC using 40x leverage via Hyperliquid in one of the largest on-chain DEX trades ever recorded. The position, tied to wallet \""0x507,\"" was entered when BTC was priced at $108K and now sits on over $40 million in unrealized profit. Wynn booked partial profits early Thursday by closing 540 BTC (~$60 million), to net $1.5 million. His prior exits were followed by BTC declines, so traders are watching closely, as reported . Hyperliquid runs on its custom L1, HyperEVM, using the HyperBFT consensus (200K+ TPS) with CEX-level features like real-time order books and deep liquidity — no KYC required. The platform’s permissionless design and lightning-fast execution are increasingly drawing capital from centralized venues to DeFi , and this trade could set a precedent for whale activity. HYPE jumped 15% in the past 24 hours on renewed attention and usage-driven speculation. Derivatives Positioning Analyzing the liquidations heatmap of the BTC-USDT pair on Binance, the largest liquidations cluster around $108.5K and $106.9K with liquidations worth $143 million and $112.5 million, respectively. Meanwhile, BTC the options market swells post-breakout, with open interest on Deribit climbing above $34 billion, just shy of the all-time high of $35.9 billion set in December. The bulk of this positioning is centered on the 30 May expiry, which now holds over $9 billion in notional value to become a key date for potential volatility. Bullish sentiment is clearly in control, with traders aggressively targeting upside via calls. Strikes at $100K, $120K and $150K have attracted particularly large open interest, reflecting growing conviction in a continued rally. Put/call ratios underscore this shift in sentiment — the 24-hour volume ratio has dropped to 0.49, while the open interest ratio sits at 0.60, indicating a meaningful tilt toward bullish exposure following BTC’s move above $110K. Near-term options activity is also picking up, with weekly and monthly contracts seeing notable inflows. Traders appear to be positioning for further momentum or short-term price swings in the wake of the breakout.

With a confirmed close above that level and no sign of a swing failure pattern, the bias remains firmly tilted toward continued upside. In the near term, BTC may encounter resistance around the $112,000–$113,000 range, aligning with a trendline drawn from the prior highs in December and January. However, last week’s consolidation above $100,000 — and the successful reclaim of the previous all-time high — suggest this area is now acting as short-term support. A pullback below $100,000, especially into the weekly order block, would likely represent a healthy correction within the broader uptrend and could offer a compelling reentry opportunity if further downside is seen.

2025-05-22T12:38:44.000Z,"UK court partially dismisses Bitcoin SV investor’s lawsuit against Binance","The United Kingdom’s Court of Appeal has partially dismissed a lawsuit brought by Bitcoin SV investors against major crypto exchanges, including Binance, for allegedly conspiring to delist the token in 2019.In a judgment handed down on May 21, the court ruled that investors who held BSV through the delisting period (classified as “sub-class B”) were not entitled to billions in speculative damages based on BSV’s hypothetical growth.These investors had claimed over 8.9 billion British pounds ($11.9 billion) in damages, asserting that Binance’s delisting deprived holders of the chance to profit from BSV’s potential rise to a “top-tier cryptocurrency” like Bitcoin (BTC) or Bitcoin Cash (BCH).The court rejected this “foregone growth effect” theory, stating, “BSV was obviously not a unique cryptocurrency without reasonably similar substitutes,” pointing to the representative’s own use of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash as comparators.Sub-class B’s central claim was that delisting led to a missed opportunity to benefit from price appreciation. However, the court determined that those investors had ample chance to mitigate losses by selling or reinvesting in other crypto assets.“They had a duty to mitigate their losses,” wrote Master of the Rolls Sir Geoffrey Vos. “They cannot recover losses that they could reasonably have mitigated.”UK court ruling against Bitcoin SV investor’s lawsuit. Source: CaselawRelated: Bitcoin SV investors attempt to resurrect 2019 Binance lawsuitCourt strikes down “loss of a chance” argumentThe appeal also challenged the Tribunal’s application of the “market mitigation rule,” arguing that such issues should be left for trial.The court dismissed that notion, stating the rule clearly applies to freely tradable assets like BSV, and that the damages must be measured shortly after the delisting.An additional argument concerning the “loss of a chance” to benefit from future price gains was also struck down. The court ruled it “flawed as a matter of principle,” noting that “cryptocurrencies are, by their nature, volatile investments.”Binance’s limited strike-out application ultimately succeeded, with the court stating that even if some holders were unaware of the delisting, “they could never claim more than the total value of their holding before the delisting events plus any quantifiable consequential losses.”Related: Binance wants arbitration for all members of securities class suitBinance seeks to dismiss FTX lawsuitOn May 16, Binance filed a motion to dismiss a $1.76 billion lawsuit filed by the FTX estate, arguing that the claims are legally flawed and an attempt to shift responsibility for FTX’s collapse.The exchange stated the downfall of FTX stemmed from internal fraud, not external manipulation, citing Sam Bankman-Fried’s conviction on multiple fraud charges.Binance has asked the court to dismiss all claims with prejudice.

Source: DeBankTrader loses out on $2.6 million gainWith ETH up over 70% since the sale, the trader lost out on over 1,000 ETH, or roughly $2.67 million, in the process of buying back in. If the trader decided to hold on to their Ether, the assets would be worth about $6.7 million. As ETH rallied, the asset surpassed the market capitalization of big companies like Coca-Cola and Alibaba. At the time of writing, company data tracker 8marketcap shows that Ether’s $321 billion market capitalization makes it the 38th most-valuable asset in the world, surpassing the pharmaceutical company AbbVie and inching closer to the Bank of America. Ether’s upswing is largely fueled by the successful launch of its Pectra upgrade. The new update introduced improvements to the network’s scalability, validator user experience and smart wallet functionality.

2025-05-22T10:21:18.000Z,"Can ChatGPT-powered AI agents really trade crypto for you?","Key takeawaysChatGPT-powered AI agents automate trading tasks using natural language prompts and API integrations, improving speed and consistency.Successes occur when ChatGPT is used as a support tool, not a fully autonomous trading system.Failures happen when traders over-rely on ChatGPT without real-time data, proper risk management or manual oversight.Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance.What if a crypto trader didn’t need to constantly check charts, worry about emotions, or stay up all night watching for sudden price swings? What if those tasks could be handled by an intelligent agent that understands instructions in plain English — and reacts within milliseconds? That’s where ChatGPT-powered AI agents come in.These tools combine natural language processing with real-time trading logic to automate decision-making in one of the world’s most volatile markets. From rebalancing portfolios to reacting to market sentiment, ChatGPT is being adapted to act as a trading assistant, risk manager and market analyst — all rolled into one. But can it truly match or even outperform human intuition? This article explores how far these agents have come, where they shine and where they still fall short.How ChatGPT-powered AI agents operate in cryptocurrency marketsChatGPT-powered AI agents are changing how people interact with crypto markets. These tools combine ChatGPT’s language abilities with external trading tools and APIs to help users monitor prices, understand trends and even place trades automatically. Instead of just reacting to charts or numbers, ChatGPT can understand plain language commands like “Buy Ethereum if the price drops below $2,000” or “Sell Bitcoin if RSI goes above 70.”These AI trading assistants can work with major platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, OKX and other centralized or decentralized exchanges and can also tap into decentralized finance (DeFi) tools and smart contracts. With the right setup, ChatGPT can help automate trading strategies based on both technical data and market news.Success stories vs. failures in ChatGPT-powered crypto tradingSome traders have used ChatGPT to assist in automating parts of their crypto trading processes, particularly for strategy generation and sentiment analysis. For example, a user shared on Reddit that they used a ChatGPT-based AI agent for technical analysis on Ether (ETH), feeding it four-hour and daily chart screenshots. By interpreting market sentiment, support and resistance zones, and other indicators, they managed to make $6,500 in profits.Similarly, in the broader crypto sector, ChatGPT has been applied to support project development activities such as drafting white papers and marketing content. A notable example is the launch of the “TURBO” memecoin, which reportedly reached a market capitalization of over $50 million in 2024. In this case, ChatGPT was used to streamline documentation and communication rather than manage trading activity, illustrating its usefulness as a support tool in crypto-related initiatives.However, limitations are evident when ChatGPT is applied beyond its core design. While ChatGPT could suggest a trading portfolio and explain its reasoning clearly, it lacks access to real-time market data and couldn’t respond to sudden volatility. In one instance, ChatGPT was allocated $100 across multiple tokens but failed to actively manage the portfolio as prices fluctuated. This resulted in missed opportunities and underperformance compared to dynamic algorithmic strategies.Individual experiences reinforce these observations. A Redditor exposed a scam where a YouTuber promoted a “ChatGPT trading bot” tutorial that led users to deploy malicious smart contracts. The contracts, generated using ChatGPT and passed off as safe, were designed to drain user wallets once funded. Victims collectively lost $17,240 in ETH, highlighting the danger of blindly trusting AI-generated code without proper auditing.Even when asked, “If I use ChatGPT to build an AI agent for crypto trading, can I become a millionaire?” ChatGPT responded with a realistic outlook — acknowledging that while it’s possible, success depends on having a profitable strategy, disciplined risk management, and the ability to scale effectively.Here is ChatGPT’s response:These cases suggest that while ChatGPT can support certain elements of the trading process, it should not be treated as a standalone solution for autonomous crypto trading.AI in crypto trading: Key benefits and limitationsAI tools like ChatGPT are increasingly being integrated into crypto trading workflows to improve speed, accuracy and efficiency. While they offer important advantages, they also carry specific limitations that traders must actively manage. Below are the main benefits and challenges:Key benefits of using AI for crypto tradingAI bots can execute trades in milliseconds, crucial for capturing opportunities in fast-moving crypto markets.Bots follow pre-programmed rules precisely, eliminating emotional biases that often affect human traders.Crypto markets are always open, and AI bots can monitor and act around the clock without interruption.A single bot can manage multiple trading pairs, exchanges and strategies simultaneously.ChatGPT can understand specific prompts like “Rebalance every Monday” or “Set stop-loss at 5%,” allowing flexible automation.Limitations of ChatGPT in cryptocurrency tradingChatGPT does not access live market data unless specifically integrated with external APIs (e.g., TradingView, CoinMarketCap or exchange websockets).Instructions must be clear and unambiguous; ChatGPT may misinterpret vague or complex commands.Improperly secured API keys or lack of two-factor authentication (2FA) can expose trading accounts to unauthorized access.ChatGPT’s cloud-based infrastructure can introduce latency, which could impact performance during highly volatile periods.ChatGPT does not monitor regional compliance rules; users must manually enforce trading limits based on local regulations.Ethical and regulatory implications of AI in crypto tradingAs AI becomes more integrated into trading systems, it raises significant ethical and regulatory concerns that stakeholders across the financial sector are beginning to address.Accountability: If an AI agent executes a harmful or unlawful trade, questions arise around legal responsibility. It remains unclear in many jurisdictions whether liability falls primarily on the developer, the trader using the AI system or the platform facilitating the transactions.Market manipulation risks: Autonomous AI bots could unintentionally engage in activities such as spoofing (placing and canceling fake orders to mislead the market) or wash trading (creating artificial volume), especially if not properly programmed with compliance safeguards.Regulatory oversight: Financial authorities, including the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the European Securities and Markets Authority, are actively studying the implications of AI and algorithmic trading. These agencies have recognized that traditional trading regulations may not fully account for autonomous decision-making by AI systems.Policy developments: In January 2024, the European Commission released updates to its Digital Finance Strategy, which included references to AI-based financial services. While not yet finalized, these draft regulations under the broader Digital Finance Package signal a move toward stricter compliance expectations for firms deploying AI in financial markets.Meanwhile, ethical crypto platforms are beginning to voluntarily disclose the use of trading bots in their systems. In parallel, open-source communities are advocating for clearer audit trails, improved model transparency and the establishment of ethical guidelines for AI applications in finance to ensure accountability and fairness.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Crypto travelers are also outspending their fiat counterparts, with an average booking value of  $1,211 per transaction, over 2.5 times more than fiat users who spend $469.Additionally, the report said crypto users were three times more valuable over their lifetime due to longer stays and higher repeat bookings, with crypto travelers 57% more likely to make a repeat hotel purchase.Source: Binance Pay, TravalaJuan Otero, CEO of Travala, attributed these travel preferences to the flexible nature of Web3 jobs:“Many also work in the digital asset industry or have flexible, remote work lifestyles, which makes them more likely to travel frequently and stay in one place for longer while seeking out destinations that support seamless, global payments.”Crypto-based transactions have become more common in the travel sector and beyond. Airlines that have integrated digital currencies into their booking systems have seen a 40% boost in bookings, with travel and hospitality representing 14% of all crypto transactions in 2024, according to a Feb. 21 report by Triple-A.Related: Crypto spending will grow, but fiat isn’t going anywhere: Mercuryo CEOThe main benefit of using crypto for travel is its borderless, global utility, Jonathan Lim, the global head of Binance Pay, told Cointelegraph. “Travelers can skip currency exchange lines, avoid foreign transaction fees, and pay instantly using assets they already hold,” he added.A growing number of crypto users also drives the increase in travelers using crypto to pay for trips. Triple-A’s report shows that cryptocurrency ownership has a compound annual growth rate of 99%, significantly outpacing the growth of traditional payment methods. Among crypto owners, 65% express interest in using it for payments.Founded in 2017, Travala is among the most popular crypto-native travel platforms, which enables users to pay for services like flights, hotel stays and tours with 141 different cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC) and USDC (USDC) via Binance Pay. Related: Bhutan launches tourism crypto payments with Binance Pay and DK BankCrypto payment covers more and more retail industriesThe first real-world Bitcoin transaction — 10,000 BTC for two pizzas — occurred 15 years ago today, on May 22, 2010, now commemorated as Bitcoin Pizza Day. Since then, crypto payments have expanded into high-end retail, luxury goods and more recently, fast food.First real-world purchase using BTC Source: bitcointalk.orgThe first retail businesses to accept cryptocurrency payments were primarily targeted at high-income consumers. In 2021, fashion brand Philipp Plein became one of the pioneers in accepting crypto, followed by Gucci, luxury watchmakers Franck Muller and Norgain, as well as high-end car dealerships and manufacturers.As the crypto holder base expands, more retailers are beginning to accept digital currencies for everyday transactions. On May 16, American fast food outlet Steak’n Shake began to accept Bitcoin as payment.Yet even with the Lightning Network implementation, a Steak’n Shake customer revealed that a $5 burger could cost over $8 with network fees and take over 20 minutes to confirm payment.Related: Bitcoin accepted at fast food chain Steak ’n Shake from May 16With Binance Pay, payments are confirmed within seconds. Lim told Cointelegraph that’s because “Binance Pay operates as an offchain, closed-loop payment solution within the Binance ecosystem.”Still, most crypto travel payments on Travala are made using stablecoins like Tether’s USDt (USDT) and Circle’s USDC (USDC).

2025-05-22T09:01:43.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Forecast - Also Using Liquidation Levels","<p>Bitcoin Price Forecast </p><p>In short, I am watching $117k - $119k on the Bitcoin futures. Now I apologize for the next video not having audio due to a technical issue being looked into, but I am sure most of you with a will, will find a way, and see why.</p><p>Now you will note in the chart within the video, also shown below, that we have that little grey line for an expected price level of liquadation at $115,500. I explain what this means further below.</p><p>Understanding Liquidation Levels and How They Influence Bitcoin Price Forecast</p><p>For Bitcoin traders and investors, understanding liquidation levels—especially those linked to large positions—is crucial. Liquidations can dramatically influence short-term price movements, triggering swift and often volatile market reactions.</p><p>What Does 'Liquidation' Actually Mean?</p><p>In cryptocurrency futures trading, liquidation occurs when a trader's leveraged position is closed automatically by the exchange because the position's margin is no longer sufficient to cover potential losses. Traders holding leveraged long positions (expecting price to rise) will face liquidation if the price moves significantly lower. Conversely, leveraged short positions (expecting prices to drop) face liquidation if prices rise significantly.</p><p>What Is 'Cumulative Short Liquidation Leverage'?</p><p>The \""cumulative short liquidation leverage\"" refers to the total amount of short positions that could be forcibly closed if Bitcoin's price hits a certain level. When the price approaches these liquidation points, shorts become at risk of being liquidated, forcing these traders to buy Bitcoin at market prices to cover their positions. This forced buying adds upward pressure on prices, often triggering even higher spikes.</p><p>Why Bitcoin Traders (and Investors) Should Care</p><p>These liquidation levels act as magnets or significant pivot points in price action. Let's consider two critical liquidation zones for Bitcoin based on recent data:</p><ul><li><p>Above Current Price: At around $115,549, approximately 3.75k BTC worth of short positions could be liquidated. This forced buying could push prices rapidly higher, creating momentum that attracts additional buyers.</p></li><li><p>Below Current Price: A notable zone between approximately $96,000 and $97,335 shows significant potential liquidations of leveraged long positions. If Bitcoin prices drop into this range, substantial selling could be triggered, rapidly pushing prices lower.</p></li></ul><p>How Liquidations Can Propel BTC Futures Price Further</p><p>When a large liquidation occurs (let's say short liquidation at a higher price), traders holding shorts must rapidly buy Bitcoin at the market price to cover their positions. This buying activity creates immediate upward pressure, potentially triggering additional liquidations of other short sellers, causing prices to spike even higher.</p><p>Moreover, these rapid price movements attract momentum traders, scalpers, and short-term speculators who ride the trend further upwards. However, caution is necessary: significant liquidation points often become attractive levels for larger, savvy traders to take profits. Thus, it's common to witness price spiking above critical liquidation levels, followed by a reversal or at least a retest of previously broken resistance or support.</p><p>Key Trading Guidance for Bitcoin Traders</p><ul><li><p>Do Not Treat Liquidation Levels as Precise Reversal Points: Instead, anticipate potential overshoots. Price often moves beyond these levels due to the aggressive market orders and new entrants drawn by the momentum.</p></li><li><p>Expect Potential Reversals Post-Liquidation Spikes: Often, sharp moves above resistance (or below support) are temporary, leading to a reversal as profit-takers seek new buyers or sellers entering at extreme prices.</p></li><li><p>Stay Alert to Retests: After a liquidation-driven breakout, watch carefully if prices return to test the previously significant level—often a key indicator of the next market direction.</p></li></ul><p>Why Track Whales Specifically?</p><p>While standard liquidation maps provide helpful insights, focusing on whale or large institutional positions offers enhanced predictive value. Large traders typically hold sizable positions with significant market impact. Their liquidation points, therefore, are more likely to trigger noticeable price movements, setting off cascades of secondary liquidations and momentum-driven trades. By tracking these larger positions, traders gain clearer insights into potentially explosive market dynamics and critical price thresholds.</p><p>In summary, understanding liquidation dynamics, especially those involving significant \""whale\"" positions, gives Bitcoin traders a vital edge. Remain vigilant around key liquidation zones, anticipate temporary volatility spikes, and prepare for potential reversals and retests. Trade wisely, understanding that these are guides—not guarantees—of price action.</p><p>Bitcoin Price Outlook</p><p>My current analysis indicates a target range of $117,000 - $119,000 for Bitcoin futures.</p><p>Please note that the above video contains visual information only, as a technical issue is currently being addressed which impacts the audio.

2025-05-22T08:37:57.000Z,"Dubai regulator clarifies real-world asset tokenization rules: Lawyer","Newly updated guidelines from Dubai’s crypto regulator include provisions on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and clarify rules for issuers. On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) released its updated Rulebook for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) operating in the region. The regulator gave market participants until June 19 to comply with the new rules. The regulator previously told Cointelegraph that it had enhanced supervisory mechanisms and brought consistency across activity-based rules. One of the more prominent changes includes regulatory clarity on RWA tokens. Irina Heaver, partner at the United Arab Emirates-based law firm NeosLegal, told Cointelegraph that the updated rules clarify RWA issuance and distribution. “Issuing real-world asset tokens and listing them on secondary markets is no longer theoretical,” Heaver told Cointelegraph. “It’s now a regulatory reality in Dubai and the broader UAE.”A “viable” path to realize RWA hypeHeaver compared RWAs to security token offerings (STOs), an earlier attempt from the crypto space to tokenize securities like stocks, bonds and real estate investment trusts. However, the UAE crypto lawyer said that STOs “died a peaceful death in 2018 to 2019.” The lawyer told Cointelegraph STOs did not work out because of the lack of regulatory clarity, viable secondary market trading venues, institutional investor appetite and liquidity. Still, the situation is different for RWAs. Heaver told Cointelegraph that RWAs are the next foundational layer for institutional adoption of blockchain and virtual assets. Heaver said that VARA’s new rules already cover them as Asset-Referenced Virtual Assets (ARVA) tokens. She said: “VARA’s newly updated Virtual Asset Issuance Rulebook (May 2025) addresses these failures head-on. Regulated exchanges and broker-dealers in Dubai are now authorized to distribute and list ARVA tokens.”The lawyer said this solves an issue in jurisdictions like Switzerland, where token issuance is possible, but listing and secondary trading remain unregulated. Related: Dubai gov’t agencies to link real estate registry with property tokenizationLawyer shares requirements for RWA issuersHeaver said ARVA tokens are defined under Dubai law as representing direct or indirect ownership of real-world assets, granting entitlement to receive or share income and purporting to maintain a stable value by reference to real-world assets or income. ARVA tokens are also backed or collateralised by such real-world assets or constitute a derivative, wrapped, duplicated, or fractionalised version of another ARVA. The lawyer said issuers must meet specific requirements, including a Category 1 Virtual Asset Issuance license, a comprehensive white paper and a risk disclosure statement. In addition, issuers must have a paid-up capital of 1.5 million UAE dirhams (about $408,000) or 2% of reserve assets held. The issuers are also subjected to monthly independent audit obligations and must adhere to ongoing supervisory oversight. “VARA is providing regulatory clarity, and it’s giving the industry a viable, enforceable path to turn the hype of RWA tokenization into reality,” Heaver told Cointelegraph. “This matters because it marks a shift, from theory to execution, from fiction to framework.”Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/dubai-vara-guidelines-rwa-tokenization-clarity?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-22T08:25:00.000Z,"5 red flags you’re being shilled: Don’t buy the hype","What is shilling in crypto?              At its core, shilling is the act of artificially promoting a cryptocurrency or token, often with exaggerated claims, to increase its price or popularity. But what’s the goal? Hype it up, get others to buy in, and then cash out, leaving latecomers holding the bag.Shilling can come from anyone: influencers, anonymous accounts or even high-profile figures with political or financial clout. The common thread is manipulation: It’s not about educating you or building real value but pumping hype for personal gain.Unfortunately, the line between enthusiastic promotion and outright deception can be thin, and many fall victim without realizing it. That’s why it’s critical to learn how to spot the signs early.                  5 red flags you’re being shilled              Beware of crypto red flags like overhyped promises, anonymous teams, influencer shills, missing products and FOMO tactics — if it smells like a scam, it probably is.1. Overhyped promises You’ve probably seen posts that scream:“100x potential!”“Guaranteed returns!”“This is your ticket to financial freedom!”These are classic shill tactics. Real, credible projects don’t promise life-changing profits. Why? Because there are no guarantees in crypto or in any investment.When a project leads with grandiose financial claims rather than actual product value or utility, it’s likely a ploy to stir FOMO and attract unsuspecting investors. The truth is, if something sounds too good to be true, it almost always is.Remember: The bigger the promise, the bigger the red flag.2. Anonymous or suspicious teams In crypto, anonymity isn’t always bad, but when you’re trusting people with your money, transparency matters.It’s a major red flag when a project has:No identifiable team membersFake names or aliasesStock photos on its websiteNo LinkedIn or professional history.The simple rule is “No face, no funds.”Scammers often hide behind anonymity because they know they’ll eventually vanish and there’ll be no one to hold accountable. Even worse, some use fabricated credentials or hire actors to pose as team members.Before investing, check whether the founders or developers have any verifiable history. Do they have prior experience in blockchain or startups? Have they launched anything successful before?3. Influencer spam and paid promotions One day, no one’s talking about a particular coin — the next, your feed is flooded with influencers hyping it up. Sound familiar?This sudden burst of attention is often coordinated with a paid promotion campaign disguised as “genuine enthusiasm.”Many influencers fail to disclose sponsorships, even though it’s required by law in many countries. The US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have cracked down on this in recent years.Take, for example:Kim Kardashian, who was fined $1.26 million in 2022 for promoting EthereumMax without proper disclosure.Floyd Mayweather Jr., who was sued for endorsing the same project at a paid event.BitBoy (Ben Armstrong), who faced legal action in multiple lawsuits for promoting scam tokens to his audience.If you notice multiple influencers promoting the same project in a short time, especially without using labels like #ad or #sponsored, it’s a strong indicator of a shill campaign.Don’t mistake volume for value. Hype doesn’t equal legitimacy.4. No real product or roadmapIf you visit the project’s website, it looks sleek, maybe even impressive. But where’s the product? Where’s the code?Shilled tokens often rely on flashy marketing but have no working application, no GitHub code and no actual use case. Everything is either “coming soon” or buried behind vague promises.Ask yourself:Can I use the platform or app today?Is there a white paper that makes sense?Do they have public repositories or open development?If all you’re seeing is a landing page and a vague roadmap that’s been “coming soon” for months, that’s a major red flag.5. Pressure tactics and FOMO Time pressure is a psychological weapon, and shillers know how to use it.Watch out for lines such as:“Presale ends in 2 hours!”“Only 1,000 spots left!”“If you don’t buy now, you’ll miss out forever!”These tactics prey on your fear of missing out (FOMO) and push you into making impulsive decisions without research.But crypto isn’t a sprint; it’s a long-term game. Anyone trying to rush you into buying likely has something to hide. Solid investments don’t need fake urgency.Take a breath, step back, and ask yourself: Am I buying because I believe in this project or because I’m being manipulated?Did you know? The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) secured a $128-million judgment against Ryan Mitchell Pope, Daniel Samuel Bishop and their company EmpiresX for operating a fraudulent forex and cryptocurrency investment scheme that defrauded over 12,500 victims.                  Is shilling illegal in crypto? Can influencers be sued?              Shilling isn’t just unethical in many cases — it’s also illegal.In the world of crypto, undisclosed promotions are a major legal risk. If someone is paid to promote a token or project but fails to reveal that financial connection, they could face fines, lawsuits or even criminal charges. This is especially true if the promoted token is later classified as a security under US law.Regulators like the SEC, FTC and CFTC have all cracked down on this behavior. Their targets have included:Influencers who failed to disclose paid promotionsPromoters who misled investors with false claimsIndividuals who ran pump-and-dump schemes using social media.Francier Obando Pinillo, a pastor from Miami, was indicted on 26 fraud counts for running a crypto scam through “Solano Fi,” defrauding investors of millions from 2021 to 2023. He allegedly used his church, social media and false promises of 34.9% monthly returns to lure victims. The platform showed fake gains but blocked withdrawals, while funds were diverted for personal use. Pinillo was arraigned in Richland, Washington and faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.As crypto becomes more mainstream, expect stricter regulations and more consequences for shillers.Did you know? Argentine President Javier Milei has dissolved the special task force investigating the LIBRA cryptocurrency scandal, a project he promoted in February 2025 that surged to a $4.5-billion valuation before crashing by over 97%. The task force, created by Milei himself, was disbanded via Decree 332/2025, citing that it had fulfilled its purpose. However, critics argue that no official findings were released, and judicial investigations into Milei and his associates continue.                  How to protect yourself from shilling scams              Do your own research, verify the team and utility, ignore hype and influencers, and stay alert to pump-and-dump schemes to avoid crypto shilling traps.Let’s understand how you can protect yourself from shilling scams in crypto:Do your own research (DYOR): Always research the project, the team behind it and the data supporting the claims. Don’t rely solely on hype or influencer recommendations. Look into onchain data, GitHub activity and the project’s utility to make informed decisions.Verify the team: A legitimate crypto project should have a transparent and credible team. If the developers are anonymous or have no professional profiles (like LinkedIn), that’s a red flag. Always check the team’s past projects and credibility before investing.Look for real utility: Does this project actually solve a problem? A genuine project should have a working product or solution, not just promises. Avoid projects that lack real-world utility or are still in “coming soon” stages for extended periods.Ignore the hype: If a token is suddenly trending on social media or being aggressively promoted, don’t let FOMO influence your judgment. Shillers often rely on emotions to push their agenda, so it’s essential to evaluate projects based on their merits, not just popularity.Stay skeptical of influencers: Influencers with large followings may be paid to promote certain tokens. Before taking their advice, ask yourself, What’s their incentive? Verify the promotion is legitimate and disclosed as paid or sponsored. Always cross-check the information with independent sources.Watch for pump-and-dump schemes: Be cautious of sudden price spikes followed by rapid drops. These are often signs of pump-and-dump schemes where the token’s value is artificially inflated by coordinated buying and then quickly sold off, leaving investors with losses. Always monitor price trends and be wary of sudden, unexplained increases in value.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/5-red-flags-youre-being-shilled-dont-buy-the-hype?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The steps include a new, trustless architecture, a native token, and the Seeker ship date.According to the announcement, Solana Mobile will ship the device starting Aug. 4. Seeker is the company’s second-generation device, after the Saga Web3 phone that launched in April 2023. The company unveiled the Seeker phone in September 2024, saying it wouldn’t just be a “memecoin phone.” So far, it has pre-sold 150,000 units.The Solana Seeker has gone through two sale phases: The Founder window, where the price for each device was $450, and the Early Adopter window, where the price per device was $500. Assuming the lower price window, Solana Mobile could generate at least $67.5 million in gross revenue from device sales. For comparison, the iPhone generated $199.3 billion in revenue for Apple in 2024.The new architecture that will govern future Solana Mobile devices is called TEEPIN, which stands for “Trusted Execution Environment Platform Infrastructure Network.” It is a three-layer architecture — hardware, platform, and network layers — that will allow users, developers, and device makers to participate in a trustless environment.Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder and CEO of Solana Labs, called TEEPIN “the next evolution in mobile” and a framework where trust is “verified by cryptography.”In addition, Solana Mobile is planning to launch “SKR,” the native asset of the Solana Mobile ecosystem. \""It transforms the traditional mobile business model by giving stakeholders actual ownership in the platform,” said Emmett Hollyer, general manager at Solana Mobile. Related: Solana lacks ‘convincing signs’ of besting Ethereum: SygnumSolana Saga Solana Mobile’s first released device, Saga, initially elicited mixed reactions from the Web3 community — some hailed it as Web3’s “iPhone moment,” while others pointed to the network’s outages as a drawback. The Saga phone didn’t take off until late 2023, when a surge in the value of memecoins stored on the devices turned them into unexpected profit machines. Some units were listed on eBay for thousands of dollars, driven by growing demand.

From a broad perspective, the $77 billion in Bitcoin futures open interest has undoubtedly played a role. However, a closer look at the data shows a more positive outlook for further price gains.Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.chThe current 7% annualized Bitcoin futures premium is well within the neutral range of 5% to 10%, which has been typical for the past two weeks. This indicator can easily exceed 30% during periods of strong optimism, so the current level is relatively low. At the same time, the absence of excessive leverage reduces concerns about a rally driven primarily by derivatives.Balanced order books and spot Bitcoin ETF inflows point to spot-driven rallyFor comparison, during the previous Bitcoin $109,346 all-time high on Jan. 20, the annualized futures premium reached 15%, showing a much higher level of leveraged bullish positions affecting the price. Therefore, the current Bitcoin derivatives market appears healthier, suggesting strong demand in spot markets.During the January bull run, Bitcoin’s price on Coinbase traded at a premium compared to other exchanges. This so-called Coinbase premium is not present now, which means buying pressure is more evenly spread out—a sign of a healthier market.Coinbase Bitcoin/USD relative to competitors. Source: TradingView / CointelegraphWhile excessive buying pressure on a single exchange is not necessarily bearish, it can make it easier to trigger unsustainable price surges when liquidity is low. This data supports the idea that derivatives markets were not the main driver of the recent price increases. Moreover, the $1.37 billion in net inflows to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States between May 15 and May 20 further suggests that spot buyers, rather than derivatives traders, were the primary force behind the rally.Despite the lack of conviction in Bitcoin futures, several indicators point to further upside. Forced liquidations of bearish BTC futures positions were relatively low at $170 million between May 18 and May 21, cementing the idea of a spot-driven rally. In comparison, the rally to $104,000 on May 9 triggered $538 million in liquidations over three days.Related: Is Bitcoin price close to a cycle top? — 5 indicators that help traders decideBitcoin options put-to-call ratio at Deribit.

Still, the potential for the price to reach $110,000 and higher is partly based on the weak position of the US Federal Reserve.

A break below the 20-day EMA will be the first sign that the bulls are booking profits in a hurry.

The ETH/USDT pair is likely to pick up momentum on a break above $2,739. That clears the path for a rally to $3,000.Contrary to this assumption, a break and close below the 20-day EMA signals that the bears are back in the game.

The pair could slide to $153 and later to the 50-day SMA ($145).

2025-05-21T17:55:00.000Z,"Interest groups, lawmakers to protest Trump&#039;s memecoin dinner","Democratic leaning organizations and members of Congress have announced plans to protest what they describe as the sale of access to the office of the US president, in reference to Donald Trump’s memecoin dinner on May 22. The event’s attendees are said to have collectively spent over $100 million for the chance to meet with the US president.Since Trump’s memecoin project, Official Trump (TRUMP), announced that its top 220 tokenholders would have an opportunity to apply for an exclusive dinner with the president, many leaders in the crypto industry and US lawmakers have criticized the event, saying Trump was opening his office to potential bribery and corruption. The memecoin dinner prompted some Democratic lawmakers to withdraw support for crypto-related legislation in Congress, including the market structure and stablecoin bills.“Trump collecting gifts from foreign governments is unconstitutional,” a spokesperson for the consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen, which is planning to protest near the memecoin dinner on May 22, told Cointelegraph. “Collecting foreign government investments through his memecoin is not much better. American foreign policy should not be for sale.”Source: Public CitizenCrypto industry figures such as Tron founder Justin Sun, Kronos Research chief investment officer Vincent Liu, Hyperithm co-CEO Oh Sangrok, and Synthetix founder Kain Warwick are among the tokenholders expected to attend the dinner at the Trump National Golf Club outside Washington, DC. The memecoin project said all applicants had to pass a background check and could not be from a “[Know Your Customer] watchlist country.”Related: Democrats seek suspicious activity reports linked to Trump crypto venturesPublic Citizen, in partnership with progressive political organization Our Revolution, will hold a rally near the golf club, which Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley is expected to attend. In addition, the Arlington and Loudoun Democrats will be hosting a separate event to urge US officials to “hold [Trump] accountable,” and Democratic leadership in Congress has scheduled two press events on May 22 ahead of the dinner.“Americans cannot and will not accept President Trump’s view that positions of power exist only to benefit the holder of that power,” Ryan Ruzic, chair of the Loudoun County Democratic Committee, told Cointelegraph. “We have a moral responsibility to speak out against corruption, whatever the result may be.”Pushback on TRUMP memecoin affected crypto legislationSome lawmakers initially cited the memecoin dinner and the Trump family’s involvement with the crypto platform World Liberty Financial in opposing passage of the GENIUS Act, a bill to regulate payment stablecoins. World Liberty Financial began issuing its own USD1 stablecoin in March, prompting concerns about Trump’s conflicts of interest. However, the legislation passed a key procedural vote in the Senate on May 19 with support from Democrats, setting the bill up for debate in the chamber.“Many senators, myself included, have very real concerns about the Trump family’s use of crypto technologies to evade oversight, hide shady financial dealings, and personally profit at the expense of everyday Americans,” said Sen. Mark Warner in a statement before the May 19 vote, adding: “But we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay.”Senator Chris Murphy, who voted against advancing the GENIUS Act, called for bipartisan support in amending the bill to specifically bar a US president from issuing stablecoins. He also called on the White House to release a complete list of attendees to the memecoin dinner, suggesting that some or all of them would “try to get something from the president” in exchange for purchasing the tokens. Murphy and Senator Elizabeth Warren will attend a press event with representatives for Public Citizen on May 22. California Representative Maxine Waters, ranking member of the US House Financial Services Committee, announced a separate press conference for the same day, with plans to introduce a bill to “block Trump’s memecoin and stop his crypto corruption, once and for all.”As of May 21, the exact number of attendees to the dinner was unknown. A smaller group of 25 tokenholders also qualified to apply for “VIP tour” and reception — presumably at the White House — with Trump, but the complete list of those planning to attend was also unknown at the time of publication.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/protest-donald-trump-memecoin-dinner?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-21T17:02:48.000Z,"Is Bitcoin price close to a cycle top? — 5 indicators that help traders decide","Key takeaways:Bitcoin market cycle tops are notoriously hard to time, but combining technical and behavioral indicators can offer strong signals.The MVRV-Z Score, Pi Cycle Top indicator, trade volume trends, Puell Multiple, and exchange inflows accurately predict Bitcoin price cycle tops.Bitcoin (BTC) might be approaching the final stage of its current market cycle — a dramatic final rally followed by a sharp correction and, eventually, a bear market. For many, this could be the long-awaited climax of the past four years, and major players are preparing accordingly.Since late 2024, Bitcoin whale accumulation has surged. Glassnode data shows that the number of addresses holding over 100 BTC has jumped by almost 14%, reaching 18,200 — a level not seen since 2017. The biggest market players appear to be positioning for what could be this cycle’s final run-up.Number of BTC addresses holding over 100 BTC. Source: GlassnodeHowever, riding the rally is trickier than it looks and knowing when to exit is notoriously difficult. The lure of higher price highs fuels FOMO, driving investors to buy the top, only to face painful drawdowns or even liquidations.So, how can traders and investors spot the top before the market enters recession?Bitcoin cycle top markersSeveral technical and onchain indicators, such as MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Z-score, Pi Cycle Top, and trading volume trends, have historically been reliable in signaling when Bitcoin is nearing its peak.The MVRV-Z score compares Bitcoin’s market value to its realized value and adjusts for volatility. A high Z-score suggests Bitcoin is significantly overvalued relative to its historical cost basis. When this indicator is at a historical high, the ensuing downward trend in Bitcoin prices is likely.The Pi Cycle Top tracks BTC price dynamics using moving averages. When the 111-day moving average (111-SMA) crosses above twice the 350-day average (350-SMAx2), it signals overheating. In other words, when the short-term trend catches up to the long-term trajectory, a market top is in.Historically, all previous Bitcoin bull runs started with a notable surge in MVRV Z-score, and ended with 111-SMA crossing the longer-term trend.BTC: Pi Cycle Top + MVRV Z-score. Source: Marie Poteriaieva, GlassnodeAdditionally, lower trading volumes during price increases can be a warning sign, often signaling weakening momentum and potential for a reversal. On-balance volume (OBV), which registers cumulative volume flow, is a valuable metric for tracking this process. When OBV diverges from the price action, it is often an early reversal signal. The second leg of the 2021 bull run was a great example. While BTC price was hitting higher highs of $68,000 (compared to the previous all-time high of $63,170), trading volumes moved in a different direction, decreasing from 710,000 BTC to 628,000 BTC. This created a bearish divergence between price and volume, suggesting that fewer market participants were supporting the rally — a classic sign of waning momentum.BTC/USD 1-day, OBV.

Some valuable metrics that can track it are the Puell Multiple and exchange flows.The Puell Multiple Indicator looks at miners' revenue relative to its 365-day average.

In line with its current trajectory, 21st Capital co-founder Sina noted that Bitcoin is approaching a pivotal moment around the $108,000 level. The Bitcoin Quantile Model update shows that BTC’s market reflects the same “heat” that was present after President Trump’s post-election rally and the spot ETF-driven highs during Q4 2024. The model, which uses quantile regression to map Bitcoin’s price phases on a logarithmic scale, indicates the cryptocurrency is in the Transition Zone, a critical juncture before the Acceleration Phase.

Source: X.comAs illustrated in the chart, once it breaks into the \""Acceleration\"" Phase, it could trigger BTC’s next leg or the mid-phase, typically between the 33% and 66% range. Based on the model, BTC is expected to progressively target price levels of $130,000 and $163,000 in the coming months. However, anonymous Bitcoin analyst apsk32 believed a price target above $200,000 is a “reasonable” expectation for 2025. Basing the projection on Bitcoin’s “power curve,” the analyst noted that BTC’s position relative to gold has significantly improved since April. From a technical standpoint, this view is supported by the recent convergence of the Sharpe ratios for Bitcoin and gold, suggesting that the two hard assets now offer comparable risk-to-reward profiles to their investors. Fidelity’s Director of Global Macro Jurrien Timmer shed light on this development, recommending a 4:1 goal-to-Bitcoin ratio from an allocation perspective. Related: Bitcoin 'blow-off top' set at $128K with new all-time highs in sightStrong Bitcoin volumes “final straw” before new highs Crypto researcher Aylo analyzed BTC’s historical price action when the crypto asset consolidates near its all-time high level. In an X post, the analyst explained, “The data shows when BTC gets close to its previous ATH during a strong, accelerating trend with high momentum, it has historically broken out to new ATHs within a short time (days to weeks).”However, weaker trends have led to stalls or retraces between March and May 2024. Currently, Bitcoin exhibits a strong trend but lacks the necessary trading volume, which remains the final straw to confirm a breakout, a factor that could delay upward movement.Alyo added that for Bitcoin to break its all-time highs, daily trading volume should exceed the previous 10 days, be at least 1.5 times the 20-day average, and ideally sustain a 3-day increase while the price holds steady or rises.Data from CryptoQuant has reinforced Aylo’s concerns about trading volume.

2025-05-21T15:00:00.000Z,"How to handle crypto trading gains and losses on your balance sheet","Key takeawaysProperly accounting for crypto assets on your balance sheet is essential for accurate tax reporting and financial transparency.Crypto trading activities should be recorded like stock trading, at fair market value on the day of purchase.In some countries, like the US, crypto losses can offset gains, so keeping track of gains and losses is important for reducing taxable income.Whether you’re an individual investor or a business, treating cryptocurrencies as assets and documenting them ensures compliance with tax laws and minimizes the risk of errors.Let’s be real, it’s easy to lose sight of what you’ve actually gained or lost, especially when it comes to crypto and its market volatility and frequent trading activities. And when it comes to accounting, especially in countries like the United States, it gets trickier because you must reflect those numbers properly on your balance sheet. If you are running a business that involves crypto or you are just a crypto investor, understanding how to account for your digital assets correctly is crucial. This guide breaks down the basics of balance sheets, handling crypto gains and losses, and what tax implications you need to account for.What is a balance sheet, and why is it needed?Think of a balance sheet as a report of your financial health. It shows what you own, owe and what’s left over at a specific point in time. It contains three main parts: Assets: What the company owns, such as cash, crypto, real estate, inventory, etc.Liabilities: What the company owes, such as loans, unpaid bills and taxesEquity: What’s left after subtracting liabilities from assets (net worth).For example, if you own $50,000 worth of crypto, and at the same time, you owe someone $20,000. In this case, your equity is $30,000. Balance sheets help you understand your financial position at a glance. They’re essential for filing taxes, attracting investors, applying for loans and complying with regulations. Balance sheets are essential in countries like the United States, where businesses must report crypto holdings accurately for tax and compliance reasons. Similarly, in the UK, European countries and Canada, balance sheets are important for businesses and are often used by individuals, especially when dealing with crypto assets. It’s not just for taxes. A well-maintained balance sheet can help you get funding, plan your finances, or simply sleep better knowing where you stand at night.How do you treat crypto on a balance sheet?One of the most common questions when preparing a balance sheet is, “How to report crypto trading gains and losses on a balance sheet?” In most jurisdictions, the crypto reporting and taxation rules are still to be decided or clarified. This also applies to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which lack definitive guidance concerning cryptocurrency accounting.As cryptocurrencies are considered assets in many jurisdictions, the fundamental concepts of accounting for assets could apply when preparing a balance sheet involving crypto transactions. Below is an example of a simplified crypto balance sheet treatment and some helpful pointers that may assist you in accounting for crypto trading in 2025.Notes to the balance sheet:Cash ($15,000): Represents fiat currency (e.g., USD) held in bank accounts or wallets, including proceeds from selling crypto or other revenue.Cryptocurrency ($20,000): Recorded at cost basis (fair market value at acquisition, less any impairment). Includes 0.5 Bitcoin (BTC) purchased at $30,000 each ($15,000 total) and 10 Ether (ETH) purchased at $500 each ($5,000 total). No impairment has been recorded, assuming the fair market value (FMV) remains above cost.Mining equipment ($5,000): Capitalized cost of crypto mining hardware, net of depreciation. The original cost was $8,000, with $3,000 accumulated depreciation over two years.Accounts payable ($2,000): Unpaid bills (e.g., for electricity or supplier services related to crypto mining operations).Taxes payable ($1,500): Estimated tax liability for realized crypto gains (e.g., from selling 0.1 BTC at a $2,000 gain, taxed at 20% long-term capital gains rate for simplicity).Retained earnings ($36,500): Accumulated profits, including crypto-related income (e.g., mining revenue, realized gains) minus expenses and taxes. Reflects net income from prior and current periods.When buying cryptocurrency with fiat moneyWhen you buy cryptocurrency with fiat money, such as dollars or euros, you’re simply exchanging one type of asset, such as cash, for another, like crypto or stocks. On your balance sheet, cryptocurrency trading activities should be recorded similarly to those of stock trading activities. As with stocks, you should record cryptocurrency on your balance sheet at its fair market value on the day of purchase. While your cash account displays a credit for the same amount, the cryptocurrency is recorded as a debit to your assets account.When selling cryptocurrency for fiat moneySelling crypto for fiat creates a change in your balance sheet: Your crypto holdings will be reduced, meaning credited, and your cash will increase, which also means that the account will be credited.If you sell for more than you paid (the original price of a token), you have a gain; if you sell for less, you record a loss. Both crypto gains and crypto losses should be tracked carefully for tax and reporting purposes.How to record crypto lossesThe difference is recorded as a loss when you sell crypto at a lower price than you bought it for. In some countries, these losses can lower your taxable income, so it can prove useful to properly document them.  However, even if the asset regains its previous price levels, impairment losses cannot be undone in accordance with GAAP’s accounting rules for intangible assets.This contrasts with IFRS, where certain intangible assets can be revalued upward under IAS 38 if an active market exists. However, crypto markets are volatile, and IFRS guidance on crypto revaluation remains unclear, so most entities stick to cost-less impairment. Businesses should consult local accounting standards and auditors for precise treatment.How to record crypto profitsIf you receive cryptocurrency as payment for goods, services or other activities, it’s treated as income at the fair market value on the date you receive it. This value is recorded as revenue and added to your assets. Later, if you sell or swap the crypto, any difference in value will result in a capital gain or loss.How to record crypto mining When cryptocurrency mining income occurs, it should be reported at the currency’s fair market value. This revenue should be shown on your income statement since it increases your assets.Similar to other revenue-generating activities, companies engaged in cryptocurrency mining are required to report their crypto profits on their balance sheet. Their mining income account will be credited as a result. Subsequently, the newly generated digital asset has to be recorded in their accounts at its fair market value.Additionally, costs related to mining operations should be recorded. For example, the cash account needs to be credited if cash is spent to cover mining costs. The purchase of mining equipment, which requires capitalization and amortization, will subsequently be deducted from the associated asset account or otherwise documented as a cost for items like utilities and supplies.Using cryptocurrency to pay suppliersPaying suppliers or vendors with cryptocurrency is like selling the asset since you have to recognize any gain or loss in relation to its original value. Therefore, the difference between the asset’s book value and its expense will be recorded as a capital gain.How to record transaction fees and exchange rates It’s critical to keep track of transaction costs and exchange rate fluctuations when trading or exchanging cryptocurrencies. Fees should be shown as an expense on the balance sheet since they lower your net gain or increase your loss. Changes in exchange rates may also have an impact on the value recorded when converting cryptocurrency into fiat, which could have an effect on your taxes and capital gains.Did you know? Cryptocurrency held for more than a year can be categorized as a long-term asset on your balance sheet in some jurisdictions, which may result in better tax treatment than short-term holdings.How are cryptocurrencies taxed?Taxation of cryptocurrencies varies by country, but your balance sheet plays a crucial role in tracking taxable events. Under current GAAP, crypto is recorded at cost and tested for impairment. IFRS allows revaluation in rare cases, but most entities use the cost model. For traders holding crypto as inventory, GAAP (ASC 330) or IFRS (IAS 2) may apply, with FMV adjustments. The lack of definitive guidance means businesses must apply judgment and document assumptions clearly. In the US, crypto is treated as property, with taxes applied to capital gains when selling or trading. The Internal Revenue Service requires reporting on your balance sheet; losses can offset gains. Also, the US introduced Form 1099-DA in 2025 for crypto brokers to report transactions, increasing compliance requirements. In the UK, cryptocurrencies are taxed under capital gains for individuals, while income tax may apply if trading is frequent or when crypto is received as income, such as through mining, staking or as payment for services.Canada follows a similar approach, taxing crypto as capital gains (50% inclusion rate) or business income for active traders. Mining income is taxable as income.In Germany, long-term holders (over a year) pay no tax on capital gains, but short-term trades over 600 euros are taxed. Notably, the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation (effective 2024) standardizes crypto reporting, impacting balance sheet documentation in member states.Accounting for Ethereum transactionsEthereum, the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts, has unique accounting needs. Here’s how to handle common Ethereum transactions on your balance sheet:Staking rewards: Staking ETH on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network generates rewards, treated as income at FMV when received. For example, receiving 0.1 ETH as a staking reward debits your “Cryptocurrency” asset account and credits “Revenue” on your income statement. Selling staked ETH later triggers a capital gain or loss.Gas fees: Ethereum transactions incur gas fees, which are expenses. Record these as a debit to “Transaction Fees” (an expense account) and a credit to “Cash” or “Cryptocurrency” if paid in ETH. For example, a $50 gas fee paid in ETH reduces your ETH holdings and is expensed.DeFi transactions: Yield farming or liquidity provision (e.g., on Uniswap) generates rewards, treated as income at FMV when received. For example, earning 100 UNI (UNI) tokens ($1,000) debits “Cryptocurrency” and credits “Revenue.” Track gas fees and token swaps as expenses or taxable events.ERC-20 tokens: Ethereum-based tokens (e.g., USDC, LINK) are separate assets. Record each at its FMV at acquisition, like ETH, and track them individually to avoid confusion.Accurate tracking of Ethereum transactions ensures compliance, especially with increased IRS scrutiny on staking and DeFi in 2025.Tools and best practices for crypto accountingManaging crypto transactions can be daunting, but these tools and tips simplify the process:Accounting software: Use platforms like CoinTracker, Koinly or CryptoTaxCalculator to track Ethereum transactions, calculate gains/losses, and generate tax reports. These tools integrate with wallets and exchanges, ensuring accurate FMV records.Regular reconciliation: Match your balance sheet’s crypto holdings to wallet/exchange records monthly to catch errors, especially for gas fees or staking rewards.Work with professionals: Crypto tax rules, especially for Ethereum’s DeFi and staking, are complex. Consult a crypto-savvy accountant to ensure compliance with IRS, His Majesty’s Revenue & Customs or other regulations.Document everything: Keep records of every Ethereum transaction, including FMV, gas fees and staking rewards, to prepare for audits or Form 1099-DA reporting in 2025.By staying organized, you’ll minimize errors and stress when filing taxes or preparing financial statements.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-trading-gains-and-losses-on-balance-sheet?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Market downturns are often triggered by counterproductive sentiment-driven events rather than by fundamental issues, creating a significant disconnect between price behavior and the actual progress being made within the industry by the companies within it. What often goes unnoticed is how much real development happens during these downturns. While market movements capture most of the attention, teams are building faster and more deliberately behind the scenes than ever. The focus shifts away from price speculation and toward real execution. Growth happens during downturns. It's a necessary phase for projects that thrive in a volatile industry. They re-focus attention on refining their technology and business, fueling the next wave of progress.As a result, there's a disconnect between online sentiment and conversations between blockchain industry leaders. For builders and project leaders, the atmosphere is of determination, not doom.Regulators are coming on boardOne of the most promising developments is the accelerating momentum of regulation policy. Many European companies are applying for MiCA licenses in preparation for regulatory updates. There's also a significant policy shift under new US leadership as the SEC retreats from several high-profile crypto enforcement actions. The disparity between sentiment and reality serves as a reminder that price is a lagging indicator. Selloffs are triggered by uncertainty around tariff announcements and background activity such as interest rates. Material, long-term statistics speak for the virtually universal optimism among industry leaders as the number of active developers has remained stable, and the number of established developers almost doubled last year. That's an incredible jump in only one year. From hype to substanceMaturation means teams thoughtfully building, governments engaging seriously with legislation, and users demanding better UX and real utility. The industry has a well-established pattern — market corrections wipe away hype and encourage focus. The last bear market gave rise to breakthroughs in DeFi, NFTs, and zero-knowledge tech. This time, it's about real-world infrastructure, regulation-ready platforms, and next-gen scalability.What emerges in these periods tends to be less visible but more durable. Teams that remain active are often those with clear models, sufficient runway, and a willingness to adapt. These are the periods when we learn whether the systems being built can handle real-world demands. One of the most promising frontiers lies at the intersection of AI and blockchain, the most ubiquitous being within Large Language Models. AI is, however, only as good as the data it's trained on.AI systems are evolving rapidly, but their foundations are skewed. They're built primarily on data scraped from the digital-first countries that predominantly lie in the northern hemisphere, which dominates global media production and internet usage. This creates a feedback loop where Western and East Asian perspectives and widely spoken languages such as English and Mandarin are not only amplified but leave little room for necessary data from smaller populations.A report from Web3 Technologies said 60% of tier-one media on the internet is English. Prominent among these media outlets is The New York Times, which has sued OpenAI based on copyright infringement. The publication alleges that their copyright-protected data was used to train OpenAI's LLM model. Recent: The future of finance is built on Bitcoin — Ethereum was just the testnetKnowing the full extent of the global imbalance in the data creating AI outputs is impossible. Allegations like this and the results delivered when using AI tools suggest the pressing need for a solution.It's even worse. When AI systems are trained on narrow, incomplete data sets, the results can exclude billions from the benefits of emerging technologies. As IBM highlights, data bias isn't just a technical issue — it's a human one with real-world consequences in healthcare, finance, agriculture, and beyond.It's become normal to use AI data every day. We receive personalized Google search results, Adobe has built AI into its industry-standard graphic and video software, and we use AI assistants like Gemini, Grok, and ChatGPT to formulate the thoughts with which we represent ourselves. All of these tools are affected by an overwhelming bias toward the center of a bell curve within their data sets, unable to access or address less common use cases.A popular example demonstrates this issue: Until recently, image generators could not create a full wine glass. No matter what prompt you provided, a wine glass full to the edge was beyond the capabilities of all known generative AI software because they had never been provided photos of wine glasses full to the brim. Their data sets had to be updated to correct this comical problem, which revealed a much more serious one.Decentralized data offers a solution. Globally incentivized systems like DePINs enable the participation of populations that would otherwise remain underserved, allowing the valuable data they provide to come online. This improves the service for everyone, making smaller global communities more accessible to commerce and enabling them easier access to the rest of the world. It also empowers smaller data creators to monetize their data rather than relinquishing it to tech giants. Where do we go from here?The crypto industry is entering a new phase. A phase that's more productive and sustainable. Expect to see rapid growth in working infrastructure, platforms and applications that welcome knowledgeable, consumer-friendly regulations and projects that respect the time and money of their users.Opportunities within the crypto space are changing but not shrinking. Our opportunities grow as we learn from what has not worked in the last few years. They will take time to develop, but successful builders will focus on long-term, incremental change and sound business practices rather than chasing fads and short-term profits.The momentum of real progress has never been stronger, and it is precisely during times like these, when it feels like no one's watching, that the foundations of the future are laid.Opinion by: Markus Levin, co-founder of XYO.

2025-05-21T14:00:55.000Z,"AI tool claims 97% efficacy in preventing ‘address poisoning’ attacks","Crypto cybersecurity firm Trugard and onchain trust protocol Webacy have developed an artificial intelligence-based system for detecting crypto wallet address poisoning.According to a May 21 announcement shared with Cointelegraph, the new tool is part of Webacy’s crypto decisioning tools and “leverages a supervised machine learning model trained on live transaction data in conjunction with onchain analytics, feature engineering and behavioral context.” The new tool purportedly has a success score of 97%, tested across known attack cases. “Address poisoning is one of the most underreported yet costly scams in crypto, and it preys on the simplest assumption: That what you see is what you get,” said Webacy co-founder Maika Isogawa.Address poisoning detection infographic. Source: Trugard and WebacyCrypto address poisoning is a scam where attackers send small amounts of cryptocurrency from a wallet address that closely resembles a target’s real address, often with the same starting and ending characters. The goal is to trick the user into accidentally copying and reusing the attacker’s address in future transactions, resulting in lost funds.The technique exploits how users often rely on partial address matching or clipboard history when sending crypto. A January 2025 study found that over 270 million poisoning attempts occurred on BNB Chain and Ethereum between July 1, 2022, and June 30, 2024. Of those, 6,000 attempts were successful, leading to losses over $83 million.Related: What are address poisoning attacks in crypto and how to avoid them?Web2 security in a Web3 worldTrugard chief technology officer Jeremiah O’Connor told Cointelegraph that the team brings deep cybersecurity expertise from the Web2 world, which they’ve been “applying to Web3 data since the early days of crypto.” The team is applying its experience with algorithmic feature engineering from traditional systems to Web3. He added:“Most existing Web3 attack detection systems rely on static rules or basic transaction filtering. These methods often fall behind evolving attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures.“The newly developed system instead leverages machine learning to create a system that learns and adapts to address poisoning attacks. O’Connor highlighted that what sets their system apart is “its emphasis on context and pattern recognition.” Isogawa explained that “AI can detect patterns often beyond the reach of human analysis.”Related: Jameson Lopp sounds alarm on Bitcoin address poisoning attacksThe machine learning approachO’Connor said Trugard generated synthetic training data for the AI to simulate various attack patterns. Then the model was trained through supervised learning, a type of machine learning where a model is trained on labeled data, including input variables and the correct output.In such a setup, the goal is for the model to learn the relationship between inputs and outputs to predict the correct output for new, unseen inputs. Common examples include spam detection, image classification and price prediction.O’Connor said the model is also updated by training it on new data as new strategies emerge. “To top it off, we’ve built a synthetic data generation layer that lets us continuously test the model against simulated poisoning scenarios,” he said. “This has proven incredibly effective in helping the model generalize and stay robust over time.“Magazine: Crypto-Sec: Phishing scammer goes after Hedera users, address poisoner gets $70K",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-system-has-97-claimed-efficacy-in-preventing-address-poisoning-attacks?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

After failing to gain support from key Democrats on May 8, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act passed the US Senate in a 66–32 procedural vote on May 20 and is now heading to a debate on the Senate floor.The bill seeks to set clear rules for stablecoin collateralization and mandate compliance with Anti-Money Laundering laws.Related: German gov’t missed out on $2.3B profit after selling Bitcoin at $57K“This act doesn’t just regulate stablecoins, it legitimizes them,” said Andrei Grachev, managing partner at DWF Labs and Falcon Finance.“It sets clear rules, and with clarity comes confidence.

As of 2023, it had over 150 million Guatemalan quetzals in assets, equivalent to roughly $20 million US.

Source: CoinGlassCommenting, Keith Alan, co-founder of trading resource Material Indicators, highlighted several moving averages (MAs), the $100,000 mark, and the 2025 yearly open as potential long-term support retest zones.The highest of these, the 21-day MA, stood at $101,640 on the day.“The 50-Day MA is on a trajectory to Golden Cross with the 200-Day MA in a tight range that has confluence with the Trend Line AND the 2025 YO,” he wrote in part of his latest post on X. “You can’t really ask for stronger technical support than that.”Alan argued that a deeper retracement to support would strengthen Bitcoin’s overall recovery and help boost the odds of holding higher levels going forward.“I’d personally consider a dump to that level a gift, but at this point I don’t think it’s a likely one. In fact the further the 21-Day MA (green) gets from $100k, the less likely we are to get the support test I’ve been looking for,” he concluded. “Whether BTC retests $100k or not, I’m happy to see consolidation in this range before the next leg up.”BTC/USD 1-day chart.
