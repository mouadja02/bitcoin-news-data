2025-05-22T07:07:07.000Z,"Crypto Conversations Surge as Bitcoin Breaks $107K and Altcoins Spark Heated Debates","The cryptocurrency market is once again generating a stir in the social media channels and forums it shares with the broader financial ecosystem, fueled by a recent upswing in the price of Bitcoin and a medley of new narratives around various other altcoins — narratives that range from levels of market sophistication seen before the last major crypto bubble, to political intrigue, to financial innovation. With Bitcoin having recently broken the $107,000 mark for the first time since January, much excitement has spilled over into discussions around several other big-name tokens. Attention has been focused once more on Bitcoin and on its fundamental role as a hedge against inflation and as a long-term store of value. Yet at the present moment, a rather mixed bag of assets—DeFi tokens, politically linked assets, stablecoins—are generating their own waves of conversation and speculation, not all of which is entirely sane. Bitcoin Eyes New All-Time High, Social Buzz Follows Bitcoin is still the leading topic in the cryptocurrency discussion as it nears what could be a new all-time high. After breaking through the $107,000 level, the number one cryptocurrency seems to have a renewed engagement on social media. The dialogue appears to have shifted back to some of its long-standing talking points, and they are as follows: 1. Long-term investment case (still valid, still holding strong, still a conversation point). 2. Ability to withstand macroeconomic shifts (Bitcoin “isolationism”). 3. Safety and soundness: decentralized, not controlled by anyone, and no one can mess with it. Renewed momentum has long-term holders celebrating, while new entrants wonder if they have missed the boat or if this is still a very early stage. Analysts are watching the institutional inflows closely and, in the context of inflation and global economic uncertainty, are drawing Bitcoin’s newfound status as a modern digital reserve asset into the appeal conversation. Altcoins in the Spotlight: From Politics to DeFi Innovation Bitcoin may yet lead the way in value, but a range of altcoins commands attention for reasons that go beyond price action. Among the most talked-about is TRUMP ($TRUMP), a politically charged token that keeps the waters stirred. Recently, a surge of media coverage and online chatter spilling over from discussions about Donald Trump, both in his capacity as former U.S. president and as a current player in global politics, has lent the coin an ever-increasing visibility. In the decentralized finance space, Aave ($AAVE) is making all the right headlines. The on-chain lending platform has posted stellar performance numbers—its Total Value Locked (TVL), by various estimates, is now somewhere between 25 and 40.7 billion dollars (for contrast, Aave’s all-time low TVL, in October 2022, was 6.7 billion). Its actual $AAVE token price has increased this past week between 15% and 25%, and the trading volumes have been very healthy—up between 35% and 50% (depending on the source) over this past week—across the three major exchanges. Overall, Aave provides a clear compliance pathway for regulatory acts like the GENIUS Act. As Bitcoin has climbed above $107K for the first time since January, teasing a new all-time high, these are the coins seeing the top rises in talks across social media: Bitcoin $BTC : Crypto's #1 coin breached $107K, closing in on a new ATH. Chats include long-term… pic.twitter.com/DeoHORxZaL — Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 20, 2025 Ankr ($ANKR), meanwhile, sits at a crossroads. Community sentiment has split, with some users expressing frustration over perceived delays and poor communication from the team. Criticism focuses on what some see as stagnation and unmet expectations. But others point to ongoing development, like integration with Neura and enhancements to token utility. They’re call for transparency and community engagement. Leader’s gonna lead. Stablecoins and XRP: Financial Infrastructure Under the Microscope The stablecoin sector is also creating a stimulating social media discourse, with USD Coin ($USDC) at the center of all the speculation. As a cornerstone of digital finance, USDC’s role is being analyzed and reanalyzed as the same old, same old conversation around USDC’s purported liquidity starts to bubble up again. Why? Because once again, people are asking whether USDC might be sort of kinda close to maybe, possibly, a stablecoin under threat from the same forces that seem to be threatening a lot of crypto: regulation and litigation. Now, XRP is becoming all the more relevant, and not by coincidence. The various converging factors influencing some recent price momentum make an up-to-the-minute look at XRP quite interesting. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity service, which uses XRP as a bridge currency, is now operational in 24 countries. The service, underscoring XRP’s cross-border utility, attracts very little of the front-line attention that is quickly funneled to Ripple’s many efforts to scale this product. Introducing XSGD, a Singapore dollar-backed stablecoin deployed on the XRP Ledger, and Ripple’s push into global payments and finance have made XRP a key player in the crypto infrastructure. The ongoing competition between Ripple and Coinbase in places like the institutional finance adds to the intrigue. Conclusion With Bitcoin almost touching its all-time high, the larger crypto universe is abuzz with talk, speculation, and even some intrigue. From DeFi breakthroughs and regulatory optimism to political narratives and stablecoin skirmishes, the market’s complexity is on full display. And all these stories, increasingly, seem to point in the same direction: That crypto, once a fringe movement, is quickly becoming a central force in the future of finance, and by some accounts, the future of politics and global technology.

The message “L bozo” was left on-chain , clearly mocking ZachXBT and other analysts tracking the movement. This unusual act of digital defiance unfolded just after Coinbase refused to meet a $20 million ransom demand . The incident shocked the crypto community and investors are fearing a bigger security breach however the industry is not bowing down to such incident and plans to fight back. @zachxbt just reported that the threat actor who stole $300M from a Coinbase user through social engineering has swapped the 42.5M+ to ETH and is now trolling him… lol. @etherscan has already flagged the wallet, but there is another wallet the threat actor swapped to.… pic.twitter.com/LoBjAsvIiw — Specter (@SpecterAnalyst) May 22, 2025 Coinbase Refuses $20M Ransom Demand Coinbase confirmed that the breach originated back in December when a support agent was bribed to hand over sensitive user data. Nearly 97,000 customer accounts were exposed, including government-issued IDs and email addresses. While no passwords or private keys were compromised, the attacker threatened to exploit the data for phishing or further manipulation. Instead of yielding to pressure, Coinbase offered a $20 million bounty to find the hacker. Soon after, the attacker moved $42.5 million in BTC to ETH using Thorchain , and then sold 8,698 ETH for $22.1 million in DAI. The transfer was traced live by analysts, making more interesting. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Michael Arrington Warns Coinbase Hack Could Lead to Deaths – Here’s Why , $42.5 Million in Bitcoin Swapped to Ethereum The aftermath is expected to be costly.

In a new filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Ohio-based Strive says it is joining hands with 117 Castell Advisory Group LLC to secure Bitcoin holdings at a discount price. The plan is to go after BTC claims that have already received definitive legal judgments but are still awaiting distribution. Strive is interested in the Bitcoin claims related to Mt. Gox. The now bankrupt crypto exchange operated between 2010 and 2014 and oversaw more than 70% of Bitcoin transactions at its peak. The Tokyo-based firm collapsed following a security breach that led to the theft of 750,000 BTC. The 75,000 BTC claims from the Mt. Gox estate are currently worth over $8.2 billion based on the flagship crypto asset’s price of $109,963. “This strategy is intended to allow Strive the opportunity to purchase Bitcoin exposure at a discount to market price, enhancing Bitcoin per share and supporting its goal of outperforming Bitcoin over the long run.” Strive submits the disclosure as it plans to team up with the social media marketing firm Asset Entities to form the first publicly traded asset management Bitcoin treasury company.

2025-05-22T07:00:59.000Z,"Bitcoin’s Momentum Is Back — But MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP Are Already Leading the Smart Capital Flow","As 2025 unfolds, the cryptocurrency market is witnessing a powerful resurgence in Bitcoin (BTC), but the real story is the strategic rotation of capital into MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA), XRP (XRP), and promising altcoins like Cardano (ADA) and Sei (SEI). While BTC’s dominance is undeniable, savvy investors are looking beyond the flagship crypto to maximize returns and diversify their portfolios. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Bitcoin (BTC): The Comeback King Bitcoin has reclaimed the spotlight, smashing through previous all-time highs and drawing renewed institutional and retail interest. With spot ETFs gaining traction and regulatory clarity improving, BTC has surged past $109,500. This rally is fueled by both macroeconomic uncertainty and Bitcoin’s status as a digital safe haven. As more investors adopt a “buy the dip” mentality, Bitcoin’s momentum appears set to continue, with the $110,000 level in focus as the next psychological milestone. MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA): The New Altcoin Darling Despite Bitcoin’s impressive gains, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the breakout star of 2025. As the leading political meme coin, MAGA has attracted over $8 million in presale funds and boasts a rapidly growing community of more than 20,000 holders. With a capped supply of 100 billion tokens and a presale price under $0.001, MAGA’s scarcity and hype have analysts projecting a potential 18,500% return on investment, with a $1 price target by year’s end if momentum persists. What sets MAGA apart is its blend of meme coin energy and structured tokenomics. The project’s HashEx-audited smart contracts and viral grassroots marketing have created a unique combination of credibility and excitement. As smart capital flows into MAGA, it’s clear that investors are seeking both high upside and community-driven narratives. XRP (XRP): Regulatory Clarity and Institutional Adoption XRP is enjoying a resurgence thanks to recent legal victories and the prospect of an XRP ETF. The resolution of Ripple’s SEC case has removed a major obstacle, paving the way for institutional adoption and new products like CME’s cash-settled XRP futures. Currently trading between $2.39 and $2.60, XRP is seeing increased whale accumulation and robust trading volumes. Analysts are optimistic, with near-term targets of $2.85–$3.40 and the potential for $5.50–$15 by year-end if ETF approval and adoption accelerate. XRP’s appeal lies in its utility for cross-border payments and its newfound regulatory clarity, making it a top choice for both retail and institutional investors seeking exposure to the next wave of crypto innovation. ADA and SEI: Quietly Building Strength While BTC, MAGA, and XRP grab headlines, Cardano (ADA) and Sei (SEI) are quietly attracting smart capital. ADA’s robust development ecosystem and attractive staking rewards make it a favorite among long-term holders. Meanwhile, SEI’s focus on high-throughput, decentralized trading infrastructure is drawing DeFi enthusiasts looking for the next big thing in blockchain technology. Both ADA and SEI benefit from the broader altcoin rotation as investors seek diversification and exposure to emerging narratives. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF Conclusion Bitcoin’s (BTC) momentum is undeniable, but the most strategic capital is already flowing into MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP (XRP), where early-stage upside and institutional adoption are fueling the next phase of the bull market. ADA and SEI offer additional opportunities for growth and diversification, rounding out a forward-thinking crypto portfolio for 2025. As the market evolves, these assets are set to define the smart capital flow and shape the future of digital finance.

2025-05-22T07:00:00.000Z,"Historic Day For Hong Kong: Stablecoin Bill Receives Legislative Approval","Hong Kong’s Legislative Council has passed the long-anticipated Stablecoins Bill, establishing a licensing regime for fiat-referenced stablecoin (FRS) issuers. This legislative move , announced by the Hong Kong government on May 21, aims to strengthen regulatory oversight on virtual asset activities, fostering both financial stability and innovation in the region. Ordinance To Regulate Stablecoin Advertisements And Issuers The newly enacted Stablecoins Ordinance mandates that any entity issuing an FRS within Hong Kong, or any FRS claiming to maintain a stable value against the Hong Kong dollar, must obtain a license from the Monetary Authority (MA). The licensing requirements will focus on several critical areas, including reserve asset management, proper segregation of client assets, and a robust stabilization mechanism. Additionally, issuers must ensure they can process redemption requests for stablecoin holders at par value under reasonable conditions. According to the government’s statement, these regulations are designed to enhance public protection and safeguard investors. Under the Ordinance, only licensed institutions will be permitted to offer FRS in Hong Kong, and retail investors will only have access to FRS issued by these licensed entities. To combat fraud and scams, the Ordinance stipulates that only advertisements for licensed fiat-referenced stablecoin issuances will be allowed, ensuring that the public is shielded from misleading promotional materials. Hong Kong’s Commitment To Digital Assets Mr. Christopher Hui, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, emphasized that the Ordinance follows the principle of “same activity, same risks, same regulation.” This risk-based approach aligns with international regulatory standards and aims to create a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s digital asset market , ultimately promoting sustainable industry development while protecting user rights. Echoing these sentiments, Mr. Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, highlighted the Ordinance’s pragmatic and flexible nature. He noted that a robust regulatory framework would foster healthy, responsible growth within Hong Kong’s stablecoin and broader digital asset ecosystem. The Stablecoins Ordinance is expected to come into effect later this year, allowing the industry ample time to familiarize itself with the new licensing requirements. Transitional arrangements will also be provided to assist businesses in applying for licenses and adjusting to the regulatory landscape . Looking ahead, the Hong Kong government remains committed to nurturing the virtual asset sector. Following the establishment of the regulatory regime for trading platforms and stablecoin issuers, the government plans to initiate consultations on over-the-counter (OTC) and custodian services for digital assets, along with releasing a second policy statement on crypto development.

2025-05-22T06:59:55.000Z,"Tom Emmer revives Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act that protects non-custodial developers","Minnesota Representative Tom Emmer has reintroduced the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act in Congress, with renewed bipartisan backing and industry support. The Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act seeks to clarify that developers and service providers who do not custody consumer funds, such as miners, validators, and wallet providers, should not be classified as money transmitters. By doing so, the bill aims to prevent these actors from facing licensing obligations under state or federal money services laws. Emmer, who co-chairs the Congressional Crypto Caucus alongside Democratic Representative Ritchie Torres, said in a May 21 notice that the measure provides “commonsense clarification” to protect innovation from being pushed overseas. He stressed that without legal certainty, the U.S. risks losing developers to crypto-friendly jurisdictions. Torres also echoed this view, describing the updated version of the bill as a “smarter, sharper framework” shaped by past feedback, offering clear rules without compromising oversight. “If we want to keep the next generation of builders in the United States, this kind of legal clarity is essential. We cannot afford to let outdated or misapplied regulations drive American talent and technology overseas,” he added. You might also like: Tom Emmer’s anti-CBDC bill clears US House Financial Services Committee Representative Emmer first unveiled the bill in 2018 to provide clarity around how non-custodial blockchain developers are treated under money transmission laws. Since then, it has seen multiple reintroductions . The most recent version prior to this came in 2023 as H.R. 1747 , but similar language was voted down in committee markup. Emmer and Torres say they’ve taken that feedback seriously and returned with a revised framework designed to address earlier concerns while still defending core innovation principles. Several industry advocacy groups have rallied behind the bill, including Coin Center, the Blockchain Association, the DeFi Education Fund, the Digital Chamber, and the Crypto Council for Innovation. According to Cody Carbone of The Digital Chamber, the bipartisan bill would “finally give [developers] the freedom to build in the United States.” The bill’s reintroduction comes amid rising political tension over digital assets, with several Democratic lawmakers growing increasingly resistant to crypto legislation, especially with scrutiny mounting over President Donald Trump’s ties to the industry. For the legislation to pass, it will need to secure majority support in both chambers of Congress, but it remains unclear whether Emmer and Torres have the necessary votes. While the bill has gained backing from key industry groups and bipartisan sponsors, broader congressional support has yet to fully materialize.

2025-05-22T06:49:25.000Z,"Bitcoin Hits New All-Time High Amid Institutional Surge","Bitcoin has hit never-before-seen heights, with its market price rocketing to an astounding $109,500, a thrust that’s blasted it past its old record high of $109,241 set on January 20, 2017, the day that Donald Trump was inaugurated as president. The event seems especially timely, what with how uncertain the entire crypto market was just six weeks ago, when we were all worried about trade wars and tariffs. Bitcoin's market value has officially reached a new all-time high, climbing to $109,500, edging past its prior peak of $109,241 that was recorded back on Trump's inauguration day (Jan. 20th). This milestone comes just 6 weeks after the crypto community was exhibiting max FUD… pic.twitter.com/LNWcf3Y5OY — Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 21, 2025 Even with the chaos in the world economy, Bitcoin has somehow managed to break through its high/low ceiling, showing both resilience and growing confidence among institutional investors. This latest surge isn’t just being fueled by market optimism, though, and it isn’t just driven by retail investors who have been buying what some have called a new “bull” market. Institutional Investment Drives Bitcoin’s Growth The influx of institutional money into Bitcoin has pushed its price upward. BlackRock, the main force behind this trend, has not only been holding Bitcoin but also recently disclosed that it is now managing a spot Bitcoin ETF. The fund, IBIT, has now crossed the $20 billion mark, which in turn seems to be dragging up the price of Bitcoin. Whatever the amount might be, the presence of BlackRock in the Bitcoin arena seems to be many times more bullish than the presence of the company in the Bitcoin mine-safety space back in 2014. From a historical standpoint, markets usually gravitate toward the opposite vector of retail sentiment. They will oftentimes do what retail investors most fear. The Bitcoin rally that many are currently experiencing resembles a historical dynamic where retail investors are too fearful of tariffs and general uncertainty to take even a half step into the market. Meanwhile, institutional investors with a longer focus are pushing the price higher. Institutional investors are showing increasing interest in Bitcoin, which is slowly replacing the asset’s designation as merely speculative. German Government’s Missed Opportunity: A $2.46 Billion Mistake A recent prominent narrative in the Bitcoin market is about the German government selling a large amount of Bitcoin. Between June 19 and July 12, 2024, the German government sold 49,858 BTC. The sales were at an average price of $57,600 per Bitcoin, which gave the government $2.87 billion at the time. But now, with Bitcoin at $109,500, those same 49,858 BTC are valued at $5.33 billion. So, the German government’s sale of that huge amount of Bitcoin was a bad move, which cost them $2.46 billion in profits for the last four months. This is a narrative that paints a rather unfavorable picture for the authorities in Berlin. BTC is about to break its all-time high. The #German government sold 49,858 $BTC ($2.87B) at an average price of $57,600 between June 19 and July 12, 2024. Those 49,858 $BTC are now worth $5.33B, meaning they missed out on a $2.46B profit. https://t.co/rHdZjWpNpF pic.twitter.com/Kuvzgx6Ud3 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 21, 2025 This sale’s timing has drawn some quite vocal criticism, especially because of how much Bitcoin’s price has grown in the short time since the sale. Lots of folks are wondering if the German government, which held these assets for several years, could have ridden along on this wave of growth if it had just held onto its holdings for a few more months. It’s a missed opportunity that serves to remind one of Bitcoin’s volatility and the risks of trying to manage such a dynamic asset. Spot Bitcoin ETFs See Record Inflows Institutional interest in Bitcoin is generally not restricted to direct investments in the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have also been experiencing record inflows, which is being interpreted by many as a sign that the mainstream is embracing Bitcoin as something other than a digital cash system. On May 20, the spot Bitcoin ETFs actually registered a net outflow, but that was only the first such occurrence in five days; on the prior four days, the ETF in question had registered positive net inflows. On May 20, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a total net inflow of $329 million, marking the fifth consecutive day of net inflows. Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a total net inflow of $64.88 million, marking the third consecutive day of net inflows. https://t.co/SF4brkl9iI — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 21, 2025 Institutions and small-hand investors can gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements through Spot Bitcoin ETFs. These investment vehicles, which are traded like stocks on exchanges, present a simple and secure way for Steak holders to bet on (or hedge against) Bitcoin’s future performance. ETFs offer a fully regulated way to hold a form of Bitcoin “ownership” without direct custodial or practical issues for Bitcoin network miners. Looking Ahead: Bitcoin’s Bullish Outlook Bitcoin’s new all-time high of $109,500 represents more than just a market milestone—it signifies something more profound: a change in what the cryptocurrency is within the global financial system. Institutional investors are the ones driving the new price surge. They are putting Bitcoin into diversified investment portfolios, and their behavior is increasingly making it seem as though Bitcoin is just another kind of portfolio investment—not a outrageous speculative vehicle. Analysts expect this trend to continue, with further price increases over the next months, and even year, as more and more institutional capital flows into this previously little-touched market. Although the German government’s decision to sell Bitcoin early may serve as a lesson in seizing opportunities, it highlights the Bitcoin asset class’s incredible growth potential. Mature market conditions with new institutional players and Bitcoin ETFs as investment vehicles make a price surge for Bitcoin seem like a very likely prospect. To wrap up, the increasing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition is mirrored in its rise to new all-time highs. Institutional investors have been at the forefront of the push, and the demand from them and retail investors alike for Bitcoin-back financial products—ETFs, for instance—has been very strong. All this bodes well for the continued growth of the crypto market, which is now also the insistential investor market. If these trends hold, there’s a reasonably good chance that Bitcoin’s price will push to even greater heights in the next little while—volatility notwithstanding.

2025-05-22T06:43:06.000Z,"Tether Mints $2 Billion in USDT as Bitcoin Soars to New All-Time High","In a forceful and possibly linked series of happenings, Tether has minted another $2 billion in USDT today. This closely coincides with Bitcoin’s breakout past its previous peak. From data CoinGecko provides, the most popular cryptocurrency registered the price of $109,368 as its all-time high, which occurred just before our press time. It has since settled around $109,358. Whatever way you slice it, Bitcoin is up. And that is Tether. And how are those two things related? According to Coingecko, Bitcoin has surpassed $109,358, reaching a new all-time high. In the past 24 hours, approximately 99,000 traders were liquidated across the market, with total liquidations exceeding $300 million, including around $200 million from short… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 21, 2025 Bitcoin’s leap sent the entire market reeling. In the past 24 hours, around 99,000 traders saw their positions liquidated, with total liquidations accounting for more than $300 million. One astonishing aspect of this is that $200 million of this represented traders going from short to long positions in Bitcoin, which kind of shows where sentiment is headed. Going back to the previous paragraph, this fresh high is occurring just after Tether minted more USDT, and earlier, we suggested that large minting events might be linked to Bitcoin’s recent price ascent. Tether’s Growing Footprint and a Historic Year for USDT Minting Tether has been absolutely booming since the start of 2025. So far this year, the company has created a staggering $15.7 billion worth of USDT, taking into account both fresh issuances and burned tokens. For the most part, this consistent growth has occurred on the Tron and Ethereum blockchains—Tether’s platforms of choice, thanks to their robust liquidity (and consequently, low slippage) and nearly universal presence across the crypto ecosystem’s exchanges and DeFi protocols. The newest issuance of $2 billion is not an isolated event but part of a clear pattern in recent months. From April 23 to May 7, Tether minted around $6 billion in USDT. During those same days, Bitcoin reemerged above the $100,000 line after three months of sitting below it, leading many to see a direct connection between the upward swing in Bitcoin and the newfound liquidity afforded by Tether. An analogous situation unfolded on May 15, when another $2 billion in USDT was created. Soon afterwards, Bitcoin price once more skyrocketed, this time punching through the $105,000 ceiling. With today’s stablecoin market being replenished to the tune of $2 billion, and Bitcoin price now well above $109,000, the correlation between those two events seems to have tightened in the mind of quite a number of traders and analysts. Tether minted another 2B $USDT an hour ago. Will this drive $BTC 's price up? In 2025, #Tether minted a total of 15.7B $USDT (including burns) on #Tron and #Ethereum . As shown in the image below, Tether's minting of $USDT has typically led to a rise in $BTC 's price. From April… pic.twitter.com/4fpiB1ad52 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 21, 2025 Stablecoin Liquidity: Fueling the Fire or Following the Flame? The connection between Tether minting and Bitcoin price increases has been closely studied in the crypto community, though there remains some disagreement over what, exactly, these events signify. Some researchers argue that more Tether means more market demand for Bitcoin, even if Tether isn’t strictly a vehicle for getting Bitcoin into investors’ hands. Others think that when Tether is being minted, that’s a sign of rising Bitcoin demand, while also considering Tether a Bitcoin proxy of sorts. No matter which side of the argument one favors, the data is compelling. Every major USDT mint this year has synced up closely with big upward moves in Bitcoin. The consistent coupling of minting events and price surges has made Tether’s blockchain activity into a must-watch signal for traders. Market positioning is another essential element. Traders have been betting against a near-term breakout, as shown by the $200 million in liquidations that occurred in the past 24 hours. These forced liquidations create cascading buy orders that drive prices up and exacerbate volatility. In this scenario, the presence of Tether in the market ensures that there are enough capital and liquidity to absorb the buying pressure created by cascading forced liquidations without triggering a price reversal. Looking Ahead: A Tether-Bitcoin Tandem Rally? As Bitcoin keeps beating predictions and reaching new peaks, the importance of Tether and stablecoin liquidity is more relevant than ever. The pattern of large USDT mints being followed by Bitcoin price rallies is hard to miss, with the asset now comfortable above $109,000. There are no clear signs of it stopping, and with institutional demand seeming to only rise, some analysts have even foreseen targets of around $115,000 to $120,000 in the next few weeks. Currently, Tether has minted USDT amounting to $15.7 billion for 2025, and this underlines the scale at which the stablecoins are supporting the crypto market infrastructure. But will this trend continue? It is likely to depend on the more macro signals around the economy, the appetite from institutions to get involved, and the state of play of the regulatory landscape for both crypto and stablecoins. At present, however, one thing is unmistakable: whenever Tether replenishes its reservoir, Bitcoin appears primed to accelerate. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

This rise signals a new era of “price discovery” in the crypto market, this time driven by large institutional players rather than individual investors. Bitcoin Surpasses $111,000: New Record Hit by Wave of Institutional Demand According to crypto data platform CoinGecko, Bitcoin’s daily gain was around 3.5%, while the overall cryptocurrency market cap increased by 1.7%. However, at the same time, no significant movement was observed in other major altcoins such as XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE). According to experts, this rising wave is a movement driven by large institutional investors, unlike previous cycles. BTSE COO Jeff Mei said in a statement on Telegram, “The main driving force behind the Bitcoin rally is large institutions. Public companies using capital markets to raise cash and purchase BTC support this trend.” The increasing interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs is particularly striking. In May alone, net ETF inflows reached $3.6 billion. Expectations are also bullish in the derivatives market. On crypto derivatives exchange Deribit, options contracts with maturity dates of $110,000, $120,000 and even $300,000 due at the end of June are among the products with the most open interest. This suggests that investors believe Bitcoin can rise even higher during the summer months. The JPMorgan Effect: The Transformation of Traditional Finance The fact that the largest bank in the US, JPMorgan Chase, started offering its customers access to Bitcoin also had a great impact on the markets. It is thought that this development could be a breaking point in the perspective of crypto assets in the traditional finance world. “This move by a major institution like JPMorgan lends legitimacy to Bitcoin and could force other traditional financial institutions to take similar steps,” said Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research. The macroeconomic environment remains challenging: rising bond yields, geopolitical uncertainty and risks like a U.S. credit rating downgrade remain. But QCP Capital noted in a note on Thursday that Bitcoin has shown “extraordinary resilience” despite all of this pressure. The QCP also warned: “New highs could also draw retail investors out of the market due to the FOMO effect and push prices even higher.” Conclusion: A New Rally May Be Beginning Bitcoin breaking a new record by breaking the $111,000 level is not just a technical move; it is also an indication that cryptocurrencies are gaining more institutional acceptance. In this new era where traditional finance and digital assets intersect, BTC’s direction may continue to be upward. It is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Bitcoin Continues Where It Left Off!

Well, now you can buy Lambos with just a single BTC instead of the 200+ spent in 2013. At least one community member remembers who found a pretty good one for sale in the US. The Lambo-Bitcoin Story The story goes back to late 2013 when an anonymous buyer went to the Lamborghini Newport Beach auto dealership, believed to be the first accepting bitcoin for payments, and purchased a brand new Gallardo (model 2014) that had an USD value of $208,315 for 216.8433 BTC. Lambo Purchase Order According to marketing director Cedric Davy, the buyer most likely made the transaction public, which was “a little surprise to us,” but led to a growing number of customers who wanted to buy cars using bitcoin. The story became the embodiment of the bitcoin dream where investors, usually early adopters, purchased the asset, employed the HODL strategy for a few years, and capitalized on the enormous gains when BTC’s price went parabolic from under $1 to over $1,000. It also became one of the most significant and used memes in the crypto community – W(h)en Lambo. How Much for a Lambo? Now, let’s fast-forward to today to see what’s available in the market. A quick search on Lamborghini Newport Beach’s website shows that the starting price of a Lamborghini Huracan (the replacement of the Gallardo used in 2013/2014) is $249,865. That’s obviously the cheapest (most basic) version, while the range-topping STO starts from $344,778. With bitcoin trading above $110,000 as it charted a new all-time high today, it’s more than evident that you don’t have to spend 216.8433 to buy a new one, as you can actually purchase an entire dealership for that amount ($24 million). However, you can’t buy a brand new Huracan (the entry-level Lambo) for just one bitcoin. Instead, you might need to go back to basics and review the used car market. Your Friend Andy did so and posted a used 2006 Gallardo that has done less than 17,000 miles and currently costs only one bitcoin. That’s coming a long way from the 216.8433 spent in the original transaction. All is right in the world. We’ve reached used Lamborghini price parity with Bitcoin again. pic.twitter.com/iGiCiyMWzQ — Your Friend Andy (@OhHaiAndy) May 22, 2025 The most popular US cars website shows that there are many Gallardos you can buy if you are willing to spend your one bitcoin. In fact, there are certain options that cost around 0.85 BTC, which means that you might have some BTC left to buy new tires or change the oil. It can be easier to pay with bitcoin for those transactions today than it was 12 years ago. The post When Lambo?

2025-05-22T06:30:53.000Z,"Binance’s Spot-to-Futures Ratio Hits 1.5-Year Peak as Bitcoin Reclaims $109K","Bitcoin continues to show upward momentum as it has now finally reclaimed a critical price mark. As of the latest data, BTC briefly traded above $109,000; however, it has since retraced, now trading at $108,959, marking a 3.5% increase over the past 24 hours. This puts the asset less than 1% away from its all-time high of $109,958 recorded in January. The rally builds on weeks of gradual price appreciation, suggesting persistent bullish sentiment among investors. However, while price action appears strong on the surface, market metrics suggest a more nuanced picture underneath. New data from CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn sheds light on a shift in trading behavior, particularly on Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Ready For New ATHs? What The Charts Say Bitcoin Futures Activity Surges as Spot-to-Futures Ratio Hits 1.5-Year High In Maartunn’s recent QuickTake post titled “Spot to Futures Ratio (Binance) Hits 1.5-Year High,” the analyst pointed out that the ratio between spot and futures volume has reached 4.9, its highest level in 18 months. On May 12, Binance recorded $30.17 billion in spot trading volume versus $115.56 billion in futures trading. This 4.9x difference indicates that speculative interest, often driven by leverage, currently far exceeds direct buying pressure seen in spot markets. The Spot to Futures Ratio provides insight into the balance between actual asset purchases and derivative-based speculation. A higher ratio means that trading is more heavily concentrated in futures markets, where traders bet on price movements without owning the underlying asset. This pattern often reflects short-term sentiment and positioning rather than long-term conviction. While elevated futures activity can amplify market moves in either direction, it may also signal caution, as traders hedge rather than accumulate. The sustained gap between spot and futures volumes indicates that speculative leverage is playing a central role in Bitcoin’s current rally. Balanced Profitability Suggests Market Stability Meanwhile, on-chain metrics presented by another CryptoQuant analyst, Crazzyblockk, further contextualize the broader market sentiment. According to his data, profitability across investor cohorts remains high: wallets holding BTC for less than one month are up 6.9% in unrealized gains, while short-term holders (less than six months) are seeing 10.7% gains. Despite these elevated profit margins, there has been no significant sign of mass profit-taking or distressed selling. The Unrealized Profit/Loss (UPL) Ratio reveals that while the majority of the network is in profit, the distribution of gains across different investor groups remains relatively balanced. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Level Could Be To Watch In The Short Term, Glassnode Says This type of evenly distributed profitability has historically been associated with reduced volatility and a lower risk of sudden corrections. Crazzyblockk noted that, in previous cycles, extreme profit concentration among one group, typically short-term holders, often preceded major selloffs. However, the current structure appears more stable, with no signs of excessive selling pressure. Although macroeconomic risks and external volatility remain factors to watch, the combination of strong price action, steady accumulation, and limited distribution suggests that the market may be preparing for a new phase, potentially leading to a breakout beyond Bitcoin’s existing all-time high.

2025-05-22T06:30:00.000Z,"Is Bitcoin About To Breakout? 3 Key Indicators Say Yes (Technical Analysis) (Rating Upgrade)","Summary Bitcoin is in a strong uptrend, consistently making higher highs and higher lows, signaling a bullish market structure near all-time highs. Our custom Mean Deviation Detector shows Bitcoin has room to move higher before reaching extreme levels, supporting a bullish outlook. Bollinger Bands indicate expanding volatility, suggesting a breakout above $110,000 is likely, with a price target of $150,000. Despite some RSI caution, the risk/reward is attractive; we're upgrading BTC-USD to 'Buy' with a recommended stop loss around $75,000. Here at PropNotes , we’ve been crypto enthusiasts since 2016 when we purchased our first few Bitcoins ( BTC-USD ). Curiously, though, we didn’t start actually covering or writing about the leading digital asset until October of last year, when we rated BTC a ' Strong Buy '. In an article titled: \"" MicroStrategy Is Tapped Out, Short Shares And Buy Bitcoin Instead \"", we made the case that buying physical Bitcoins directly would be a better option than buying into Strategy ( MSTR ), the infamous, leveraged, Bitcoin holding company. Since that call, Bitcoin is up roughly 50%, although in recent months, we ended up getting more conservative in the space due to the incredibly strong rally we'd seen in prices coming into 2025: Seeking Alpha Fast-forward to the present, however, and BTC has - once again, begun trading near all-time highs. It seems a good thing is hard to keep down. But is Bitcoin actually about to stage a major breakout? We think so. Today , we’ll break down the technical situation with Bitcoin, give our outlook, and explain why 3 of our favorite indicators are currently pointing to higher prices for BTC. Sound good? Let’s dive in. Market Structure The first - and perhaps strongest - piece of evidence that Bitcoin could be headed north can be seen when you take a look at how BTC has been trading over the last few years. When it comes to assessing any asset's technical position, we tend to look at market structure before all else. Market structure - for those who don’t know - is simply a way of describing the recent highs and lows that an asset has experienced over a given period of time. These levels, then, give clues as to where future price action could occur. In this case, if you take a look at Bitcoin on the weekly chart, you’ll find that the asset has been making a series of higher highs and higher lows, from roughly the start of 2023. This defines a clear up-trend in the price of Bitcoin: TradingView In the chart above, the green and red lines delineate recent highs and lows, respectively. This higher high, higher low price action - broadly - is the foundation upon which we can then layer on further observations. As a quick side note, Technical Analysis like this doesn’t work that well on most stocks, due to the fact that equities are driven primarily by economic value (earnings) as opposed to sentiment. However, assets with more vague economic value can be prone to trading in more traditional 'price patterns'. Looking more specifically at Bitcoin, we can see that in March 2022, the digital asset made local highs of roughly $48,000 which you can see denoted by the green horizontal ray below: TradingView From there, the asset traded lower, before slowly picking up steam into 2023 and 2024. Following a breakout in October 2023, the price went from $31,000 per coin to roughly $73,000 per coin. In the following period of consolidation, the lowest point (in August 2024) was roughly $49,000: almost exactly where bitcoin had made a local high two years prior : TradingView We can see the price pattern repeat again more recently with the rally in November, ultimately ending up at highs near $109,000. From there, the asset drew down to roughly $74,000, which is exactly where it peaked roughly a year earlier: TradingView As we can see, Bitcoin respects these important price levels in the market and uses them as guideposts for further price action. Now, Bitcoin has rallied back from $74,000 to $108,000, which is quite close to the asset's all-time highs. If history is any guide, then we’re expecting a consolidation leading into a breakout, or a direct breakout above 110k in the coming weeks and months. This is supported by a combination of the importance of these price levels, with the fact that we are in a categorical up-trend. Mean Deviation That said, of course, price action isn’t everything , and some indicators can provide additional clues as to what might happen going forward. Next, we'll take a look at a custom indicator we created, which we call the ' Mean Deviation Detector ' - or 'MDD' for short. This indicator plots the distance from Bitcoins current price, versus Bitcoin's ' average pricing zone '. The idea here is that the further away Bitcoin gets from this average pricing zone, the more likely it is to revert back to that average pricing zone. This may sound a little bit confusing, but in essence, market extremes often don’t stay that way for long - on either side of the market. Right now, if Bitcoin's recent rally from $74,000 to $108,000 presented an extreme market movement, we'd argue that it would be very difficult for Bitcoin to break out and make substantially new all-time highs. However, if you look at the chart, what you’ll find is that the MDD indicator remains relatively placid, only trading at roughly 21% above the coin's average pricing zone: TradingView If you look at where the MDD has traded historically, you’ll find that anything above 36% or higher would be an extreme and anything 26% or lower would be an extreme: TradingView This is our read on BTC, over the last decade or so. However, as you'll see, we’re still in this range, which means that there’s significant room for Bitcoin's price to move north in our view. Taken together with the market structure we outlined earlier, we'd argue that Bitcoin is setting up for a potential move higher. Bollinger Bands Finally, Bollinger bands are an incredibly useful indicator for a number of reasons. While they can be used to read a market in a number of different ways, in this case, the indicator's outer bands are what we’re most interested in. As you can see, with the indicators average settings, we’re getting an expanding cone of potential price action, which shows that more volatility could be on the way: TradingView This is as opposed to contracting bands, which would signal that whatever previous bout of volatility that happened was now over, and prices may be headed back towards consolidation. Right now, we don't see this. Bollinger Bands are indicating that more volatility could be on the way. When you add up the situation with Bitcoin, what you’ll find is an asset that's trading in a strong price trend near all-time highs. Not only that, but there’s considerable upside room if Bitcoin wants to move north before prices reach local 'extremes'. Finally, Bollinger Bands indicate that we could see a cone of increased price volatility going forward, which signals that a breakout could be imminent. For us, if you 'flip' the recent price action, you’ll see that the recent dip had a range of roughly $45,000, between 110k and 75k. Going forward, our price target for potential breakout would be around $150,000, which is $40k above previous all-time highs. This is standard when it comes to traditional Fibonacci price target setting. Risks Of course, there are some risks to our thesis. Not all indicators are indicating a potential breakout, chief among them being the relative strength index - or 'RSI'. The RSI is actually indicating that prices may form a 'double top', based on the fact that we’re seeing reduced strength and vigor on the RSI, while the price action has been equally strong in this recent run-up. As you can see on the chart below, the RSI is weak going into this all-time highs situation: TradingView This is a classic sign that prices might break out higher and then fail hard at a double top . Given how much respect and experience we have with this indicator, this is the strongest piece of evidence we have supporting the idea that whatever breakout does happen may end up being a 'trap' for investors. This is definitely something to consider, which is why any trade you put on for this breakout should be accompanied by a clearly defined stop loss. We'd argue that stop loss around $75k would give enough room for the trade to potentially work, while simultaneously controlling risk effectively. Summary Overall, despite the somewhat conflicting readings, we’d argue that, on balance, the technical information available is indicating that Bitcoin could be headed higher either after a period of consolidation or within the next few weeks. Trading this long with a potential stop loss around $75k per coin appears to be an attractive risk/reward opportunity in the market. As a result, we're also upgrading BTC-USD to a ' Buy '.

The bullish sentiments led to the total market capitalization soaring to $3.51 trillion, up 3.56%, and 24-hour trading volume jumping over 62% to $192.3 billion. The positive sentiments are further justified by the Fear & Greed Index sitting at a greed score of 73. Talking about Bitcoin’s current stats, it is currently dealing at $111,486.13, soaring 8.34% intraday. Daily volume for BTC surged 82.64% to $89.74 billion, highlighting increased market participation. The Bitcoin dominance has been stagnant at around 63%. This bullish move was mainly fueled by Trump’s gala dinner, institutional, and regulatory developments. Successively, JPMorgan’s foray into Bitcoin options, alongside the Senate’s GENIUS Act, ETFs taking up 3,120 BTC have all been catalysts. With the bullish momentum and Bitcoin dominance slowing taking a drop, investors are eyeing the possibility of an altcoin season. Read our Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030 NOW! Bitcoin Dominance and Altcoin Season Bitcoin dominance has been hovering around 63% over the past 30 days and is currently at 63.90%. However, it’s worth noting that BTC dominance recently broke down from a rising wedge pattern on the daily timeframe, which is a potentially bearish signal. As per CoinMarketCap, the Altcoin Season Index, currently at 24/100, indicates we are not yet in altcoin season, but the conditions for one are forming. Historically, when Bitcoin breaks ATHs by 10% or more, altcoins tend to follow with 50–200% rallies within 2–4 weeks. For altcoin season to take hold, the following technical thresholds are being watched. Bitcoin dominance needs to drop below 61.94% as an early indicator. A break below 60.24% dominance would confirm the altseason. BTC’s price should ideally move sideways or upward without a crash to maintain confidence across the broader market. As CryptoBusy suggests, the current strategy is to let Bitcoin lead, while making positions in quality altcoins that haven’t yet surged. FAQs What is Bitcoin dominance? Bitcoin dominance is an index that measures BTC’s share of the total crypto market. A falling dominance often leads to rising interest in altcoins. Are we currently in an altcoin season? No, the Altcoin Season Index is at 24/100. However, we have favorable conditions for one. When will altcoin season begin ? Historically, when BTC breaks ATH by over 10% and dominance falls below 60.24%, altseason tends to begin within 2–4 weeks.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/crypto-bull-run-2025-altcoins-to-surge-200-in-2-4-weeks/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis",cryptocompare

2025-05-22T06:19:37.000Z,"Bitcoin reaches new all-time high above $111K as macro tailwinds drive safe-haven demand","During early Asian trading hours on Thursday, May 22, Bitcoin surged more than 4% from its peak of $109,800 on Wednesday to reach a new all-time high of $111,544. The milestone follows a brief dip to $106,000 and shows growing investor appetite for alternative assets amid rising macroeconomic uncertainty. The immediate catalyst appears to be the weak demand in the U.S. Treasury’s $16 billion 20-year bond auction on May 21. Investors pushed for lower prices, which in turn drove bond yields above 5.1%. In bond markets, yields and prices move inversely, meaning that when demand falls, prices drop and yields rise. Bonds are usually more appealing when yields are higher, but when yields rise too quickly because of poor demand, it may be an indication that people are losing faith in government debt. The ripple effect extended across other maturities, with the 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury yields climbing to 4.58% and 5.08%, respectively. Additionally, Japan’s 30-year yield jumped to a record 3.19%. Given that long-term government debt is typically seen as a safe haven in the global bond market, these moves point to a wider sense of unease.

Trenchev cited soft U.S. inflation data, a U.S.-China trade de-escalation, and Moody’s downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. “It’s possible a three-month window has opened for risk assets to thrive,” he added. On-chain data supports this rotation. Bitcoin’s realized market cap has crossed $912 billion, marking a $27 billion capital inflow since early May. Exchange inflows have dropped 82% since November, according to CryptoQuant, suggesting fewer holders are selling.

The Bitcoin price has now surged and marked new highs a few moments ago. This move seems to have flipped the market trajectory, as the altcoins like Solana are close to validating a bullish breakout. The SOL price seems to be at the foothill of a massive explosion, and hence, a rise above $220 seems to be imminent. Solana Nears Bullish Breakout The crypto markets have turned bullish as Bitcoin smashed a new ATH close to $112K. Despite the rise, the bearish activity is restrictive, suggesting more upside potential for the token. As a result, the top 10 cryptos, including Solana, are believed to remain elevated, while the pace of the rally may fade to some extent. Currently, the SOL price is working hard to validate a rebound from the crucial support. A successful rise could elevate the levels by nearly 8%; however, a final correction could be in place before rising above $200. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Bull Run 2025: Altcoins to Surge 200% in 2-4 Weeks? , SOL Targets $220 After Rebound As seen in the above chart, the Solana price is trading close to the apex of the rising wedge. The price triggers a rebound from the support and seems to be advancing towards the resistance close to $195. The CMF has been rising since the start of the month, while the MACD is about to undergo a bullish crossover, being within the positive range. Hence, the price could be poised to maintain a healthy upswing ahead. Meanwhile, after a breakout from the rising wedge, the token may face a correction that could drag the levels back to $180 or slightly lower. After squeezing out all the selling pressure, the bulls are believed to take over the rally and push the levels back above $200 in a short time. However, the Solana (SOL) price may face some bearish action at these levels, but the bulls could have held a tight grip over the rally, which may keep up the bullish momentum over the rally and test the higher targets at $220 initially and later at $250. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The Pakistan Digital Assets Authority (PDAA) will serve as a regulatory body to oversee licensing, regulate exchanges , custodians, wallets, tokenized platforms, stablecoins and decentralized finance applications, according to a May 21 report from the state-owned broadcaster, PTV. Muhammad Aurangzeb, federal minister for finance and revenue, told the broadcaster, “Pakistan must regulate not just to catch up, but to lead” in the industry. “With the PDAA, we are creating a future-ready framework that protects consumers, invites global investment, and puts Pakistan at the forefront of financial innovation,” he said.

The new regulatory body was part of a recommendation from the Pak­istan advisory body, the Cryptocurrency Cou­ncil, which was launched on March 14 and has former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao as an adviser . “This is not just about crypto — it’s about rewriting our financial future, expanding access, and creating new export channels through tokenization, digital finance and Web3 innovation,” said Bilal Bin Saqib, CEO of Pakistan's Crypto Council.

2025-05-22T06:00:48.000Z,"Could MAGACOIN FINANCE Deliver the Cycle’s Biggest Surprise? XRP and Ethereum Holders Are Taking Notice","Introduction As Bitcoin leads with macro stability and Ethereum holds its technical ground, traders are increasingly turning toward altcoins that offer early-stage positioning and exponential upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one such project—an unexpected contender that’s now drawing attention from seasoned XRP and ETH holders looking to diversify. With Polkadot (DOT) also gaining quiet traction, the landscape is shifting fast, and speculative capital is on the move. Could MAGACOIN FINANCE become the surprise breakout of the 2025 cycle? Many analysts now believe so—and early investors are positioning accordingly. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Early-Stage Altcoin Positioned for a 25x–35x Run MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly becoming one of the most talked-about early entries of 2025. Fueled by a bold political identity, rising visibility, and a carefully crafted token structure, this project is striking a chord with both retail speculators and strategic traders. It offers a rare blend of cultural relevance and structural integrity—two traits that rarely align this early in a project’s life cycle. With a target listing price of $0.007 and current entry levels still deeply undervalued, analysts estimate a 25x upside in the months ahead. And with a promotional bonus still available through the PATRIOT35X code, some are projecting up to 35x returns through increased token allocations for early backers. Here’s why traders are increasingly betting on MAGACOIN FINANCE: It taps directly into the U.S. political narrative—perfectly timed for 2025 election-driven attention Its media presence is expanding across major platforms like Google News and MSN , increasing visibility The project is aggressively incentivizing early buyers through exclusive bonus offers, drawing in high-risk capital XRP: Institutional Use, But Limited Multiples Ahead XRP continues to deliver value as a payment-focused asset, supported by global settlement use and a strong institutional narrative. However, with prices hovering near $2.30 and short-term projections topping out around $5–$10, the upside is relatively capped. For long-term holders, it remains a core part of the portfolio—but for aggressive growth, many are reallocating toward MAGACOIN FINANCE. Ethereum: Solid Infrastructure, Slower Growth Ethereum (ETH) is holding steady around $2,700 , buoyed by ETF optimism and Layer-2 expansion. While ETH remains the dominant Layer-1 for smart contracts, it’s less attractive to risk-on traders in search of outsized returns in the current market environment. That gap in potential is drawing capital toward emerging projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin and Polkadot Stay Grounded Bitcoin (BTC) is consolidating above $104,000 , acting as a macro anchor. Meanwhile, Polkadot (DOT) is gradually reawakening, with developers revisiting parachain projects and investors watching for renewed activity. Both remain solid foundations—but in terms of breakout narratives, MAGACOIN FINANCE is pacing ahead. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Conclusion The 2025 cycle may ultimately belong to the unexpected. While XRP , Ethereum , Bitcoin , and Polkadot continue to play important roles, it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that’s capturing real FOMO among high-risk portfolios. With Stage 8 nearly filled and listings on the horizon, MAGA could be the surprise altcoin that defines this cycle’s upside.

2025-05-22T05:59:35.000Z,"Bitcoin's Rally to Record Highs Puts Focus on $115K Where an 'Invisible Hand' May Slow Bull Run","Bitcoin's (BTC) price has surged to record highs, sparking optimism among investors. However, expected hedging activities of market makers/dealers, often an invisible force, at certain price levels, may slow the ascent. The leading cryptocurrency topped the $111,000 mark during the Asian hours, with analysts anticipating stronger demand. \""The OTC supply may be drying up, driving up prices. This would not be reflected in exchange trading volumes or the derivatives market. If this is the case, get ready for a wild ride, as more demand is coming on board with a competitive bitcoin corporate treasury environment and, perhaps, a less elastic OTC spot market,\"" Alexander S. Blume is the founder and CEO of Two Prime, an SEC-Registered Investment Advisor, said in a Telegram chat. Blume explained that corporate treasuries coming on board have been buying over-the-counter \""en masse,\"" and rumors are that sovereign demand for the cryptocurrency has picked up. Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget, said BTC could rally to $180,000 by the end of the year, led by spot ETF inflows, slower post-halving supply growth and growing institutional adoption. \""Moody’s recent downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating to Aa1 is another key macro catalyst, sparking renewed interest in BTC and ETH as hedges against fiat risk. BTC’s ability to hold above $103,000 amid volatility highlights the market’s shift toward crypto as a strategic reserve asset,\"" Lee said. Focus on $115K While the path of least resistance is on the higher side, the pace of the bullish move may be challenged by potential hedging activities of options market makers/dealers at around $115K and higher price levels, according to Jeff Anderson, head of Asia at STS Digital. Dealers are entities tasked with creating liquidity in an exchange's order book. They are always on the opposite side of traders' positions and make money from the bid-ask spread, while constantly striving to maintain a net-price neutral exposure. Data from Deribit's BTC options market, tracked by Amberdata, shows dealers hold significant \""positive gamma\"" exposure at $115K and higher strike price levels. When dealers' gamma is positive, it means they are long call or put options. In this case, their delta (market exposure) increases when the underlying asset increases. Thus, their delta-hedging mandate requires selling more of the underlying asset as the price rises and vice versa. The order-flow, therefore, acts as a contrarian force, limiting the price volatility, Anderson told CoinDesk. Dealer gamma is significantly positive, from $115K to $150K, thanks to investors' interest in selling (overwriting) higher strike call options to generate additional yield on top of their spot holdings. \""There is lot of positive gamma in the market due to call overwriters. They will be more wary of this breakout, and if we can clear the pocket of gamma at $115K, this [rally] could really start to go,\"" Anderson said.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/22/bitcoin-s-rally-to-record-highs-puts-focus-on-usd115k-where-an-invisible-hand-may-slow-bull-run,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Options|Markets|market analysis|News",cryptocompare
2025-05-22T05:51:49.000Z,"Feds charge Amalgam founder with stealing $1M via ‘sham’ blockchain","A US grand jury has indicted the founder of blockchain startup Amalgam Capital Ventures over allegations he defrauded investors out of over $1 million with a fake blockchain. Jeremy Jordan-Jones was arrested and indicted on May 21 and charged with wire fraud, securities fraud, making false statements to a bank, and aggravated identity theft, the Department of Justice said on May 21. Manhattan US Attorney Jay Clayton claimed Jordan-Jones “touted his company as a groundbreaking blockchain startup,” but alleged that, in reality, the “company was a sham, and investors’ funds were siphoned off to bankroll his lavish lifestyle.” FBI Assistant Director Christopher Raia alleged that Jordan-Jones defrauded investors of more than 1 million dollars through “misrepresentations of his purported company's capabilities, partnerships, and investment intentions.” Raia claimed the Amalgam founder’s “blatant lies” funded his personal lifestyle at the expense of unknowing victims. An excerpt from the indictment of Jeremy Jordan-Jones. Source: US Department of Justice According to an indictment filed in a Manhattan federal court, from January 2021 to November 2022, Jordan-Jones deceived investors and financial institutions using fabricated documents, fake sports partnerships, and misleading claims, ultimately misappropriating over $1 million for personal use. Related: Ex-Cred execs plead guilty to wire fraud over $150M crypto collapse Amalgam claimed to offer point-of-sale systems and blockchain-based payment and security solutions, the filing states. The indictment alleged the firm had “no operable products, few, if any, customers, and zero legitimate business partnerships.” The filing alleged that instead of channeling the funds into tech development and crypto exchange listings as promised, Jordan-Jones spent the money on luxury vehicles, high-end vacations, clothing and fancy restaurants in Miami. Charges carry decades in prison Jordan-Jones was also accused of submitting a fake bank statement claiming Amalgam held over $18 million in order to secure a company credit card, but prosecutors claimed there were no funds in the bank account and it had been closed in late 2021. Wire fraud and security fraud carry potential penalties of up to 20 years in prison per count, while making false statements to a bank carries up to 30 years. Jordan-Jones was also charged with one count of aggravated identity theft , which carries a mandatory sentence of two years in prison. The government is seeking forfeiture of any property or money traceable to the fraud, including substitute assets if the original funds are unavailable.

2025-05-22T05:50:30.000Z,"Bitcoin tops $111K for first time as bullish momentum builds","Bitcoin reached a new record high of $111,492 in early Asian trading, boosted by market optimism, large investor purchases, and positive signals from the U.S. government about future crypto rules. BTC jumped as much as 2.2% before dropping slightly. This is mainly driven by progress on a stablecoin bill in the U.S. Senate that traders believe will bring more straightforward rules and reduce long-standing uncertainty in the crypto industry. Source: CoinMarketCap Bitcoin gains strength as U.S. optimism and institutional demand grow Crypto investors are now more confident about how the U.S. government handles crypto regulation after lawmakers moved forward with a stablecoin bill (Genius Act). The bill creates clear rules for how stablecoins should work and who can issue them. Crypto supporters say the bill shows the U.S. is slowly opening the door to a legal framework that will let companies operate without constantly worrying about getting sued or shut down. If the bill becomes law, the firms will gain more trust from the public and investors. At the same time, Bitcoin prices keep rising because large companies continue to buy more with Michael Saylor’s company, Strategy, purchased over $50 billion worth of Bitcoin to become the biggest Bitcoin-holding public company in the world. Saylor has built his entire business strategy around buying and holding as much of it as possible, as he believes Bitcoin is the strongest form of money, inspiring many small-cap companies and newly listed public firms to copy his approach and start putting Bitcoin on their balance sheets. These companies raise money by offering convertible bonds, selling preferred stock, and using SPACs or PIPE deals to buy Bitcoin. Twenty-One Capital Inc., a new firm backed by powerful financial players like Cantor Fitzgerald, stablecoin issuer Tether, and Japanese tech investment firm SoftBank, has also come into play with backers working together to build a company that holds Bitcoin as its main asset and mirrors Strategy’s model. Strive Enterprises Inc., co-founded by entrepreneur and political figure Vivek Ramaswamy, also has one of its subsidiaries merging with Nasdaq-listed Asset Entities Inc. Traders bet big on future highs as Bitcoin regains momentum On Deribit, the world’s largest crypto options exchange, the highest number of open option contracts has gathered around strike prices of $110,000, $120,000, and even $300,000. These contracts are set to expire on June 27, which shows many traders believe Bitcoin will hit or get close to these levels in the near term. Global co-head of markets at crypto platform FalconX, Joshua Lim, explained that Bitcoin is rising slowly and steadily in what he called a “slow-motion grind” into new all-time highs. Much demand is coming from SPACs (special purpose acquisition companies) and PIPE deals (private investments in public equity) as companies rush to raise funds quickly. Lim also said that one of the most popular crypto exchanges in the U.S., Coinbase, is showing a price premium on spot Bitcoin trades because people are willing to pay more to buy Bitcoin directly on Coinbase compared to other platforms when demand is much stronger than supply. Tony Sycamore from IG Markets explained that Bitcoin’s big drop from its January high of over $100,000 down to below $75,000 in April was a normal correction inside a larger uptrend. This kind of dip is common during long bull markets and helps reset the market before prices increase.

2025-05-22T05:43:16.000Z,"Ripple’s RLUSD Poised to Replace USDT in Europe After MiCA Shake-Up","The post Ripple’s RLUSD Poised to Replace USDT in Europe After MiCA Shake-Up appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The EU just lost its most traded stablecoin, USDT, thanks to MiCA regulations , and the crypto market is already feeling the ripple effect. Tether’s decision to pull USDT from top European exchanges stems from MiCA’s tight rules with no interest payouts, strict cash reserves, capped issuance/redemptions, and required links to EU banks. With USDT gone, RLUSD might be the top contender poised to dominate, since Bitstamp, the leading European cryptocurrency exchange, has already listed RLUSD stablecoin , making it a prime fit. As crypto analyst Jake Claver put it, “Tether took one look and said, ‘we’re out.’” And just like that, a $150 billion liquidity engine exited one of the largest crypto markets. The EU lost its most widely-used stablecoin with USDT being pulled from major exchanges across Europe, all thanks to new MiCA regulations—and Tether’s decision not to play along. That opens up a huge opportunity in the market. But the real question is: who’s going to benefit? The… pic.twitter.com/aqM5WWYTPg — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) May 22, 2025 Ripple Moves In: RLUSD Grabs the Spotlight Without USDT, Europe’s crypto trading landscape looks dented. Liquidity is drying up, and users are slowly shifting to platforms outside the EU. Meanwhile, he said Circle is stepping in with MiCA-compliant USDC and EURC, but their combined market size is still small compared to USDT. While Circle offers compliance, it lacks the scale to replace Tether’s dominance fully. Claver explains, “USDC is compliant but small. Tether is massive but non-compliant. Ripple’s RLUSD brings the best of both worlds.” USDC vs RLUSD: Who Can Fill Tether’s $150B Shoes? Claver highlights that Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin could quietly become the biggest winner in this scenario. RLUSD launched in December, fully compliant with MiCA, runs on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum, and is supported by Ripple’s institutional partnerships. Unlike other projects focused on the US, Ripple had already built strong global connections, particularly in Asia, where regional stablecoins are gaining popularity. However, Ripple’s early preparation is now paying off. RLUSD offers a rare combination of regulatory alignment and global reach. According to Claver, this positions Ripple as the most likely candidate to fill the stablecoin gap in the EU. With USDT stepping aside and Circle struggling to scale, Ripple has a clear opportunity to reshape the market. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pakistan Launches Digital Asset Authority to Regulate Crypto, Targeting $25B Market , On the Contrary… Hey Jake, How does Tether not being MiCA compliant and not being compliant with the Genius act , affect Bitcoin.

Tether withdrew USDT due to MiCA’s strict regulations, which impose tight rules on stablecoin issuers, including no interest payouts, strict cash reserves, capped issuance, and mandatory links to EU banks. What is MiCA and how does it affect stablecoins in the EU? MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation) is a comprehensive EU framework that sets stringent rules for stablecoin issuers, demanding full reserves, regulatory authorization, and transparency to enhance consumer protection and market stability. How does RLUSD compare to Circle’s USDC in the EU market? While USDC is MiCA-compliant, it lacks the scale to fully replace USDT. RLUSD, also compliant, offers a combination of regulatory alignment and Ripple’s global reach, positioning it strongly. What are the broader implications of USDT’s departure for the EU crypto market? USDT’s exit is causing liquidity drying up and users shifting platforms.

2025-05-22T05:30:41.000Z,"Bitcoin Sets New ATH, But This Metric Says No Overheating Yet","The Bitcoin Network Value to Transactions (NVT) Golden Cross could indicate that the asset isn’t overheated yet, despite its price marching to a new all-time high (ATH). Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross Still Outside Of Overbought Zone In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst has talked about the latest trend in the NVT Golden Cross for Bitcoin. The NVT Ratio is an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the BTC market cap and transaction volume. If the utility of the network (measured in terms of the transfer volume) is considered as a reflection of its ‘true’ value, then this ratio can be used for judging whether the price is undervalued or overvalued. Related Reading: $3.8 Billion In Capital Inflows Behind Ethereum’s Post-Pectra Surge, Data Shows When the value of the indicator is high, it means the value of the network (that is, the market cap) is high compared to its ability to transact coins. Such a trend may be a sign that the asset is becoming overpriced. On the other hand, the indicator being low could imply room for growth in the cryptocurrency’s market cap, as its value is low when compared to the transaction volume. In the context of the current topic, a derivative form of the NVT Ratio is the indicator of interest. This metric, known as the NVT Golden Cross, is a signaling indicator for the NVT Ratio similar to the Bollinger Bands, telling us about whether the ratio’s value is near a top or bottom. The NVT Golden Cross compares two moving averages (MAs) of the NVT Ratio in order to determine this: the 10-day MA to gauge the short-term trend and the 30-day MA for the long-term one. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross has been on the rise recently as the cryptocurrency’s price has rallied to a new ATH. At present, the indicator is sitting at a value of 1.5. In the chart, the quant has highlighted two zones for the metric that have been of significance in the past. The region beyond 2.2 (shaded in red) corresponds to the territory where tops generally occur for BTC and that under -1.6 (green) to the bottoming zone. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Ready For New ATHs? What The Charts Say Clearly, despite the recent uptrend, the NVT Golden Cross hasn’t yet broken into the red zone, a potential sign that the cryptocurrency may still not be too overpriced.

2025-05-22T05:30:00.000Z,"XRP Breaks Out with First Golden Cross and Futures ETF Launch","XRP is gaining renewed momentum in both technical charts and institutional markets.] XRP has formed its first-ever golden cross against Bitcoin on the weekly timeframe, typically seen as a strong long-term bullish signal. Just as the chart pattern emerged, Volatility Shares announced it will launch the first XRP futures ETF under the ticker XRPI on May 22, further solidifying XRP's growing appeal among professional investors. XRP Forms First-Ever Weekly Golden Cross Against Bitcoin, Marking Potential Turning Point in Crypto Market In what could mark a watershed moment for altcoin markets, XRP has just achieved a rare and historic technical milestone: its first-ever golden cross against Bitcoin on the weekly chart. The move, which occurred as XRP’s 50-week moving average crossed above its 200-week moving average, is widely interpreted by analysts as a powerful bullish signal and could foreshadow a long-awaited breakout from a years-long consolidation phase. The technical achievement comes amid strengthening fundamentals for the XRP Ledger and a wave of renewed investor interest driven by regulatory clarity, increasing network activity, and long-term accumulation trends. With this golden cross, XRP may be positioned to outperform Bitcoin for the first sustained period since the onset of its legal troubles with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2020. Golden cross on the XRP/BTC weekly chart (Source: TradingView) A golden cross occurs when a shorter-term moving average—in this case, the 50-week moving average—crosses above a longer-term moving average, typically the 200-week MA. This event is seen by many traders as a long-term bullish reversal indicator, suggesting a shift in momentum that favors upward price action. For XRP, the significance is heightened because the asset has spent nearly four years in a tight range against Bitcoin, mostly due to the chilling effect of regulatory uncertainty stemming from the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple. The golden cross, appearing on a high timeframe like the weekly chart, signals a potential long-term reversal of that trend. Since late 2020, XRP has struggled to keep pace with Bitcoin’s explosive growth. While other altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche rode the wave of crypto adoption and institutional interest, XRP found itself sidelined due to legal constraints. The SEC’s case alleging Ripple Labs conducted an unregistered securities offering by selling XRP significantly suppressed investor sentiment and exchange listings. However, the tide began to turn in mid-2023 when a US federal court partially ruled in Ripple’s favor, stating that XRP is not a security in itself—a legal nuance that opened the floodgates for renewed market participation. Now, with regulatory clarity, XRP is once again viewed as a viable long-term bet. Network Growth Confirms Strength Behind the Charts This technical breakout isn’t happening in a vacuum. According to Messari’s “State of XRP Ledger Q1 2025” report, XRP is experiencing a surge in fundamental usage that aligns with its bullish chart pattern. The report highlights that XRP’s market capitalization increased by 2% quarter over quarter, while Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) experienced a combined decline of 22%. On a year-over-year basis, XRP's circulating market capitalization has grown a stunning 252%, rising from $34.6 billion at the end of Q1 2024. Further reinforcing the bullish picture, XRP network activity has soared: Average daily active addresses surged by 142% quarter over quarter to reach 134,600. Total new addresses climbed 12% from the previous quarter, hitting 568,300—a 210% increase from Q1 2024. Daily receiver addresses rose by 168%, indicating strong user inflow and payment utility. Daily sender addresses grew by 14.5%, showing both new participation and ongoing transactional engagement. These metrics point to real usage growth, not just speculative trading, which adds credibility to the idea that XRP's current rally could have longer-lasting momentum. The golden cross also coincides with rising institutional and retail demand for XRP and XRPL-based services. With US-based exchanges re-listing the token and developers increasingly turning to the XRP Ledger for decentralized finance (DeFi) and real-world asset tokenization solutions, interest in the ecosystem is ramping up. Blockchain intelligence firm Kaiko recently noted a “resurgence in XRP liquidity across major centralized exchanges,” particularly against BTC and stablecoins, which further validates the potential for increased trading volume and capital rotation. Additionally, tokenization efforts on XRPL, combined with Ripple’s ongoing global partnerships in cross-border settlements and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), are attracting long-term believers who see XRP as more than just a trading vehicle. Short-Term Outlook The market has already begun to price in XRP’s technical breakout against BTC, with some traders rotating from Bitcoin and Ethereum into XRP in anticipation of higher beta moves. The XRP/BTC pair is currently testing key horizontal resistance levels not seen since mid-2021. A successful breakout from this consolidation range could see XRP rapidly climb to higher satoshi values, with chart watchers eyeing the 0.00003000 and 0.00004500 BTC levels as possible upside targets. Analysts caution, however, that golden crosses do not guarantee sustained bull runs. Volatility Shares to Launch First-Ever XRP Futures ETF, Fueling Hopes for Spot XRP ETF Approval Meanwhile, Volatility Shares is set to launch the world’s first-ever 1x XRP Futures ETF on May 22, ushering in a new chapter in the institutional adoption of Ripple’s native token. The announcement, confirmed by Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas on X, has sent waves through the market as anticipation builds around XRP’s growing legitimacy in the eyes of regulators and traditional finance players. Trading under the ticker XRPI, the ETF will be part of the Volatility Shares Trust and represents the first XRP-linked futures exchange-traded fund to offer 1x exposure, a more conservative investment product compared to existing leveraged alternatives. The move positions XRP as the third major cryptocurrency, after Bitcoin and Ethereum, to receive such ETF treatment, reinforcing its standing as one of the most watched digital assets in the institutional space. XRP’s Institutional Milestone Volatility Shares’ decision to roll out the 1x XRP Futures ETF comes just 48 hours after the CME Group debuted XRP futures trading, a long-anticipated listing that finally opened the door for regulated futures exposure to XRP. That listing has proven to be a catalyst, rapidly expanding interest from hedge funds, market makers, and asset managers who previously lacked access to compliant XRP derivatives. Now, with an ETF product wrapping those futures contracts in a more accessible structure, institutional demand is expected to surge. The move by Volatility Shares also sets the stage for potential competition with Tectrium’s 2x Long Daily XRP ETF, which was launched just a few weeks earlier. While Tectrium’s product offers double the daily gains of XRP, it carries higher risk due to its leveraged structure. Despite the volatility, Tectrium’s ETF already commands $120 million in AUM and sees $35 million in daily trading volume, making it a significant player in the crypto ETF space. However, many analysts argue that a non-leveraged product like XRPI will attract a wider class of investors, particularly conservative institutions and retirement-focused funds that are often barred from investing in leveraged ETFs. The timing of Volatility Shares’ ETF could not be more strategic. XRP futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) are already drawing attention, as the listing provides legally compliant access for US-based institutions. The trading pairs offer monthly and quarterly contracts, settled in cash, and are already showing signs of robust liquidity. By providing 1x exposure through an ETF, Volatility Shares bridges the gap between complex derivatives markets and traditional ETF rails, allowing investors to trade XRP indirectly via any brokerage account that supports ETFs. This structure mimics the success of BITO (ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF) and BTF (Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF), which are based on CME Bitcoin futures. Spot XRP ETF on the Horizon? With the launch of XRPI imminent, speculation has reached fever pitch regarding the fate of a spot XRP ETF. While the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has yet to publicly comment on such an application, insiders suggest that the groundwork is being laid. Ripple’s partial legal victory against the SEC in 2023 provided regulatory clarity around the non-security status of XRP in secondary markets, and the successful launch of CME XRP futures appears to have removed one of the biggest hurdles for spot ETF approval—regulated market surveillance. Industry observers are drawing parallels to the Bitcoin spot ETF approval process, which also began with the launch of CME futures followed by years of market maturation.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9220/xrp-breaks-out-with-first-golden-cross-and-futures-etf-launch,"BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-05-22T05:29:19.000Z,"Worldcoin price jumps as World Assets offloads $135M in WLD tokens to early backers","Worldcoin (WLD) has joined the ongoing crypto rally despite regulatory challenges that have hindered growth for the iris-scanning digital asset project. While Bitcoin explores historic highs above $110K, WLD exhibits a bullish structure, catalyzed by the latest sale of $135 million worth of tokens by World Foundation’s subsidiary World Assets. Notably, early supporters, including Bain Capital Crypto and a16z (Andreessen Horowitz), purchased the tokens. The announcement indicated that the funding will offer Worldcoin financial support to bolster its global expansion after its latest entry into the United States . Criptovaluta.it @CriptovalutaI · Follow . @Worldcoin raises 135M from Bain and Andreessen Horowitz 7:22 PM · May 21, 2025 20 Reply Copy link Read 1 reply Moreover, the latest move comes after previous investments from leading companies like Selini Capital, Artic Digital, and Miran Ventures, confirming impressive institutional appetite for Sam Altman’s project. Notably, Worldcoin remains in pursuit of its objective of introducing internet-verified biometric identification, a narrative that has attracted limitations in multiple jurisdictions. Recently, Kenyan regulators directed the AI project to suspend its operations in the country and delete the collected biometric data. Worldcoin’s biometric device, Orb, which scans irises to generate unique user IDs, has attracted controversy globally. Individuals can use the IDs to partake in the WLD ecosystem, verify their uniqueness, and access different online services. Despite setbacks from surveillance and privacy concerns, the AI project continues to onboard users. Worldcoin will use the latest funding to support biometric data collection and issue World IDs. WLD price outlook The alt jumped from the 24-hour low of $1.103 to $1.2536 (a 13.65% increase) hours after the funding news. WLD trades at $1.24 after brief corrections from its daily high, though still 11% up on its 24-hour timeframe. Its trading volume has increased by 92% within the past day, signaling renewed trader and investor interest in the altcoin. Chart by Coinmarketcap The bullish outlook suggests a positive reaction due to institutional backing and capital inflow. These elements could support Worldcoin’s long-term growth. Nevertheless, WLD should reclaim $1.30 to change its short-term outlook to bullish. A candlestick closing above this mark could support rallies to $3.30 before extending to $3.60. That would mean a 190% surge from current prices. Meanwhile, the $3.30 – $3.60 resistance will likely catalyze near-term pullbacks. That could print a “classic” head and shoulders formation, setting the grounds for bullish continuation. Nonetheless, intensified regulations could halt the projected uptrend. In the near term, the altcoin should stabilize above $1.30 for extended rallies. Broad market sentiments would be vital for shaping WLD’s trajectory in the upcoming sessions. Bitcoin trades at record highs, and analyst Ali Martinez anticipates continued upswings as the top crypto enters a price discovery phase. BTC bulls target the $116K mark to open the gates towards the $126K zone.

BTC rose nearly 3.5% to touch $111,878 during Asian morning hours, CoinGecko data shows, lifting overall market capitalization 1.7%. Major tokens from xrp to dogecoin (DOGE) showed little movement The demand isn’t just coming from crypto-native funds or retail traders. Publicly listed companies increasingly treat BTC as a treasury asset, using capital markets to raise cash and buy more of the token. “We think that large institutions are driving Bitcoin’s rally,” said Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE, said in a Telegram message. “This trend will likely continue, especially as more companies tap public markets and ETF inflows remain strong. May alone saw $3.6 billion in net ETF demand. ”Options traders have taken note. Contracts for $110,000, $120,000 — and even $300,000 — expiring in late June currently hold the most open interest on Deribit, suggesting traders are positioning for more upside before summer ends.\"" After years of public skepticism, JPMorgan Chase reportedly offers clients access to bitcoin, signaling a deeper shift in how traditional finance views crypto exposure. “As the largest bank in the U.S., its decision adds a new layer of legitimacy to Bitcoin, potentially nudging other traditional financial institutions toward similar offerings to avoid falling behind,” said Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, in a message to CoinDesk. Despite macroeconomic headwinds, including rising bond yields, geopolitical noise, and a downgraded U.S. credit rating, bitcoin has shown “remarkable resilience,” said QCP Capital in a Thursday note. “A breakout to new highs could ignite a fresh wave of FOMO,” they added, “dragging in sidelined retail capital and pushing prices even higher.”",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/22/bitcoin-smashes-past-usd111k-setting-new-record-highs-on-institutional-fervor,"BTC|DOGE|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET","Markets|Bitcoin|Bitcoin Pizza Day|Top Stories|News",cryptocompare

The asset has now surpassed a peak of $109,500 on Wednesday and is in a new price discovery phase. It has also pushed total crypto market capitalization to $3.6 trillion. However, this remains below its peak of $3.9 trillion in mid-December as altcoins remain lackluster. Big Bitcoin Moves The asset has now gained more than 17% since the beginning of the year and is up around 47% since its April 7 crash to $75,000. Momentum is being driven by institutions as spot exchange-traded funds and corporations continue to aggressively accumulate the asset. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States have seen six consecutive trading days of inflows totalling more than $2 billion. Meanwhile, companies such as Michael Saylor’s Strategy and Japanese investment firm Metaplanet continue to scoop up BTC for their treasuries. On May 22, Digital Capital Strategist Jeff Walton said , Strategy is “the apex Bitcoin accumulator,” having bought 324,000 BTC in the last 8 months. “That is 105,000 more Bitcoin than every single company that has BTC on balance sheets combined,” he added. Strategy’s unrealized profit soared to $23.5 billion with the new Bitcoin all-time high. The stash is now worth an eye-watering $63.7 billion, according to the Saylor Tracker. Nevertheless, things are relatively quiet on the retail front with macroeconomic clouds darkening, inflation woes increasing, and social sentiment and searches at bear market lows.

Special leave is required in an appeal to the High Court, and it’s only granted in cases where it would answer significant legal questions or matters of public interest.A Block Earner spokesperson told Cointelegraph the matter has now escalated to a “broader legal question” around the definition of a financial product, which extends “well beyond Block Earner, and the crypto sector.” “We believe the Full Federal Court’s April ruling was a strong and well-reasoned decision that upheld the integrity of our operations,” the spokesperson said. “We remain confident in the soundness of that judgment and will respond to ASIC’s application through the appropriate legal channels.” Legal saga ongoing since 2022ASIC first launched legal proceedings against Block Earner in November 2022, arguing the company needed a financial services license to offer its yield product which was available from March 17, 2022, until the company shut it down on Nov. 16, 2022.Related: Australia outlines crypto regulation plan, promises action on debankingASIC was arguing Block Earner needed a financial services license to offer its crypto-linked fixed-yield earning product.

Seeker is the company’s second-generation device, after the Saga Web3 phone that launched in April 2023. The company unveiled the Seeker phone in September 2024, saying it wouldn’t just be a “memecoin phone.” So far, it has pre-sold 150,000 units.The Solana Seeker has gone through two sale phases: The Founder window, where the price for each device was $450, and the Early Adopter window, where the price per device was $500. Assuming the lower price window, Solana Mobile could generate at least $67.5 million in gross revenue from device sales. For comparison, the iPhone generated $199.3 billion in revenue for Apple in 2024.The new architecture that will govern future Solana Mobile devices is called TEEPIN, which stands for “Trusted Execution Environment Platform Infrastructure Network.” It is a three-layer architecture — hardware, platform, and network layers — that will allow users, developers, and device makers to participate in a trustless environment.Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder and CEO of Solana Labs, called TEEPIN “the next evolution in mobile” and a framework where trust is “verified by cryptography.”In addition, Solana Mobile is planning to launch “SKR,” the native asset of the Solana Mobile ecosystem. \""It transforms the traditional mobile business model by giving stakeholders actual ownership in the platform,” said Emmett Hollyer, general manager at Solana Mobile.

From a broad perspective, the $77 billion in Bitcoin futures open interest has undoubtedly played a role. However, a closer look at the data shows a more positive outlook for further price gains.Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.chThe current 7% annualized Bitcoin futures premium is well within the neutral range of 5% to 10%, which has been typical for the past two weeks.

Source: TradingView / CointelegraphWhile excessive buying pressure on a single exchange is not necessarily bearish, it can make it easier to trigger unsustainable price surges when liquidity is low. This data supports the idea that derivatives markets were not the main driver of the recent price increases. Moreover, the $1.37 billion in net inflows to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States between May 15 and May 20 further suggests that spot buyers, rather than derivatives traders, were the primary force behind the rally.Despite the lack of conviction in Bitcoin futures, several indicators point to further upside. Forced liquidations of bearish BTC futures positions were relatively low at $170 million between May 18 and May 21, cementing the idea of a spot-driven rally.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) in the overbought zone indicate that the bulls are in control.

A break below the 20-day EMA will be the first sign that the bulls are booking profits in a hurry.

The ETH/USDT pair is likely to pick up momentum on a break above $2,739. That clears the path for a rally to $3,000.Contrary to this assumption, a break and close below the 20-day EMA signals that the bears are back in the game. The pair could tumble to $2,111, which is likely to attract solid buying by the bulls.XRP price predictionXRP (XRP) has been witnessing a tough battle between the buyers and sellers at the 20-day EMA ($2.35).XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. If the price skids below the 20-day EMA, the XRP/USDT pair may stay inside the $2 to $2.65 range for a while. Instead, if the price turns up sharply from the 20-day EMA and breaks above $2.65, the advantage will tilt in favor of the bulls. The pair could rally to $3 and, after that, to $3.40, where the sellers are expected to mount a strong defense.BNB price predictionBNB (BNB) bulls have held the 20-day EMA ($639) support during the pullback, indicating buying on dips. BNB/USDT daily chart.

The pair could slide to $153 and later to the 50-day SMA ($145).

2025-05-21T17:55:00.000Z,"Interest groups, lawmakers to protest Trump&#039;s memecoin dinner","Democratic leaning organizations and members of Congress have announced plans to protest what they describe as the sale of access to the office of the US president, in reference to Donald Trump’s memecoin dinner on May 22. The event’s attendees are said to have collectively spent over $100 million for the chance to meet with the US president.Since Trump’s memecoin project, Official Trump (TRUMP), announced that its top 220 tokenholders would have an opportunity to apply for an exclusive dinner with the president, many leaders in the crypto industry and US lawmakers have criticized the event, saying Trump was opening his office to potential bribery and corruption. The memecoin dinner prompted some Democratic lawmakers to withdraw support for crypto-related legislation in Congress, including the market structure and stablecoin bills.“Trump collecting gifts from foreign governments is unconstitutional,” a spokesperson for the consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen, which is planning to protest near the memecoin dinner on May 22, told Cointelegraph. “Collecting foreign government investments through his memecoin is not much better. American foreign policy should not be for sale.”Source: Public CitizenCrypto industry figures such as Tron founder Justin Sun, Kronos Research chief investment officer Vincent Liu, Hyperithm co-CEO Oh Sangrok, and Synthetix founder Kain Warwick are among the tokenholders expected to attend the dinner at the Trump National Golf Club outside Washington, DC. The memecoin project said all applicants had to pass a background check and could not be from a “[Know Your Customer] watchlist country.”Related: Democrats seek suspicious activity reports linked to Trump crypto venturesPublic Citizen, in partnership with progressive political organization Our Revolution, will hold a rally near the golf club, which Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley is expected to attend. In addition, the Arlington and Loudoun Democrats will be hosting a separate event to urge US officials to “hold [Trump] accountable,” and Democratic leadership in Congress has scheduled two press events on May 22 ahead of the dinner.“Americans cannot and will not accept President Trump’s view that positions of power exist only to benefit the holder of that power,” Ryan Ruzic, chair of the Loudoun County Democratic Committee, told Cointelegraph. “We have a moral responsibility to speak out against corruption, whatever the result may be.”Pushback on TRUMP memecoin affected crypto legislationSome lawmakers initially cited the memecoin dinner and the Trump family’s involvement with the crypto platform World Liberty Financial in opposing passage of the GENIUS Act, a bill to regulate payment stablecoins. World Liberty Financial began issuing its own USD1 stablecoin in March, prompting concerns about Trump’s conflicts of interest. However, the legislation passed a key procedural vote in the Senate on May 19 with support from Democrats, setting the bill up for debate in the chamber.“Many senators, myself included, have very real concerns about the Trump family’s use of crypto technologies to evade oversight, hide shady financial dealings, and personally profit at the expense of everyday Americans,” said Sen. Mark Warner in a statement before the May 19 vote, adding: “But we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay.”Senator Chris Murphy, who voted against advancing the GENIUS Act, called for bipartisan support in amending the bill to specifically bar a US president from issuing stablecoins. He also called on the White House to release a complete list of attendees to the memecoin dinner, suggesting that some or all of them would “try to get something from the president” in exchange for purchasing the tokens. Murphy and Senator Elizabeth Warren will attend a press event with representatives for Public Citizen on May 22. California Representative Maxine Waters, ranking member of the US House Financial Services Committee, announced a separate press conference for the same day, with plans to introduce a bill to “block Trump’s memecoin and stop his crypto corruption, once and for all.”As of May 21, the exact number of attendees to the dinner was unknown. A smaller group of 25 tokenholders also qualified to apply for “VIP tour” and reception — presumably at the White House — with Trump, but the complete list of those planning to attend was also unknown at the time of publication.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/protest-donald-trump-memecoin-dinner?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

For many, this could be the long-awaited climax of the past four years, and major players are preparing accordingly.Since late 2024, Bitcoin whale accumulation has surged. Glassnode data shows that the number of addresses holding over 100 BTC has jumped by almost 14%, reaching 18,200 — a level not seen since 2017. The biggest market players appear to be positioning for what could be this cycle’s final run-up.Number of BTC addresses holding over 100 BTC. Source: GlassnodeHowever, riding the rally is trickier than it looks and knowing when to exit is notoriously difficult. The lure of higher price highs fuels FOMO, driving investors to buy the top, only to face painful drawdowns or even liquidations.So, how can traders and investors spot the top before the market enters recession?Bitcoin cycle top markersSeveral technical and onchain indicators, such as MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Z-score, Pi Cycle Top, and trading volume trends, have historically been reliable in signaling when Bitcoin is nearing its peak.The MVRV-Z score compares Bitcoin’s market value to its realized value and adjusts for volatility. A high Z-score suggests Bitcoin is significantly overvalued relative to its historical cost basis. When this indicator is at a historical high, the ensuing downward trend in Bitcoin prices is likely.The Pi Cycle Top tracks BTC price dynamics using moving averages. When the 111-day moving average (111-SMA) crosses above twice the 350-day average (350-SMAx2), it signals overheating. In other words, when the short-term trend catches up to the long-term trajectory, a market top is in.Historically, all previous Bitcoin bull runs started with a notable surge in MVRV Z-score, and ended with 111-SMA crossing the longer-term trend.BTC: Pi Cycle Top + MVRV Z-score. Source: Marie Poteriaieva, GlassnodeAdditionally, lower trading volumes during price increases can be a warning sign, often signaling weakening momentum and potential for a reversal. On-balance volume (OBV), which registers cumulative volume flow, is a valuable metric for tracking this process. When OBV diverges from the price action, it is often an early reversal signal. The second leg of the 2021 bull run was a great example. While BTC price was hitting higher highs of $68,000 (compared to the previous all-time high of $63,170), trading volumes moved in a different direction, decreasing from 710,000 BTC to 628,000 BTC. This created a bearish divergence between price and volume, suggesting that fewer market participants were supporting the rally — a classic sign of waning momentum.BTC/USD 1-day, OBV.

Some valuable metrics that can track it are the Puell Multiple and exchange flows.The Puell Multiple Indicator looks at miners' revenue relative to its 365-day average. High readings indicate miners may start selling aggressively, and are often seen near market tops.Large inflows to exchanges are usually signs of distribution, as investors prepare to sell their coins. BTC total transfer volume to exchanges + Puell Multiple.

The curved parabolic trendline that’s supported the rally is broken — a clear signal that the top is likely in. Meanwhile, altcoins and meme tokens may continue pumping a little longer.Complacency. Measure 15% below Bitcoin’s all-time high. That’s the sell zone. Order books on major exchanges often show a wall of sell orders around this level — a likely institutional exit point.According to Garner, the 15% (or 16%) rule works not only in crypto but in traditional markets as well.Historical blow off-tops: BTC, ETH, gold, Nasdaq, Nikkei, Broadvision, 3D Systems.

In a May 21 social media post that begins with, “The Empire Lobbies Back,” Campbell claimed that the banking industry is especially alarmed by the potential for stablecoins to offer interest or rewards to holders. In a pointed message aimed at Democratic lawmakers, Campbell wrote that “banks want you to protect their cartel so they can keep screwing your voters.” He went on to explain how fractional reserve banking enables banks to maximize profits while offering depositors minimal interest.The banking lobby says that if stablecoins pay interest or any other type of monetary reward, banks will be “harmed,” Campbell added.An excerpt of Campbell’s X post.

In line with its current trajectory, 21st Capital co-founder Sina noted that Bitcoin is approaching a pivotal moment around the $108,000 level. The Bitcoin Quantile Model update shows that BTC’s market reflects the same “heat” that was present after President Trump’s post-election rally and the spot ETF-driven highs during Q4 2024. The model, which uses quantile regression to map Bitcoin’s price phases on a logarithmic scale, indicates the cryptocurrency is in the Transition Zone, a critical juncture before the Acceleration Phase. Throughout Q4, 2024, Bitcoin rallied by 45% after entering a price discovery period above $74,500. Bitcoin Quantile Model. Source: X.comAs illustrated in the chart, once it breaks into the \""Acceleration\"" Phase, it could trigger BTC’s next leg or the mid-phase, typically between the 33% and 66% range. Based on the model, BTC is expected to progressively target price levels of $130,000 and $163,000 in the coming months. However, anonymous Bitcoin analyst apsk32 believed a price target above $200,000 is a “reasonable” expectation for 2025. Basing the projection on Bitcoin’s “power curve,” the analyst noted that BTC’s position relative to gold has significantly improved since April. From a technical standpoint, this view is supported by the recent convergence of the Sharpe ratios for Bitcoin and gold, suggesting that the two hard assets now offer comparable risk-to-reward profiles to their investors. Fidelity’s Director of Global Macro Jurrien Timmer shed light on this development, recommending a 4:1 goal-to-Bitcoin ratio from an allocation perspective. Related: Bitcoin 'blow-off top' set at $128K with new all-time highs in sightStrong Bitcoin volumes “final straw” before new highs Crypto researcher Aylo analyzed BTC’s historical price action when the crypto asset consolidates near its all-time high level. In an X post, the analyst explained, “The data shows when BTC gets close to its previous ATH during a strong, accelerating trend with high momentum, it has historically broken out to new ATHs within a short time (days to weeks).”However, weaker trends have led to stalls or retraces between March and May 2024. Currently, Bitcoin exhibits a strong trend but lacks the necessary trading volume, which remains the final straw to confirm a breakout, a factor that could delay upward movement.Alyo added that for Bitcoin to break its all-time highs, daily trading volume should exceed the previous 10 days, be at least 1.5 times the 20-day average, and ideally sustain a 3-day increase while the price holds steady or rises.Data from CryptoQuant has reinforced Aylo’s concerns about trading volume.

2025-05-21T15:00:00.000Z,"How to handle crypto trading gains and losses on your balance sheet","Key takeawaysProperly accounting for crypto assets on your balance sheet is essential for accurate tax reporting and financial transparency.Crypto trading activities should be recorded like stock trading, at fair market value on the day of purchase.In some countries, like the US, crypto losses can offset gains, so keeping track of gains and losses is important for reducing taxable income.Whether you’re an individual investor or a business, treating cryptocurrencies as assets and documenting them ensures compliance with tax laws and minimizes the risk of errors.Let’s be real, it’s easy to lose sight of what you’ve actually gained or lost, especially when it comes to crypto and its market volatility and frequent trading activities. And when it comes to accounting, especially in countries like the United States, it gets trickier because you must reflect those numbers properly on your balance sheet. If you are running a business that involves crypto or you are just a crypto investor, understanding how to account for your digital assets correctly is crucial. This guide breaks down the basics of balance sheets, handling crypto gains and losses, and what tax implications you need to account for.What is a balance sheet, and why is it needed?Think of a balance sheet as a report of your financial health. It shows what you own, owe and what’s left over at a specific point in time. It contains three main parts: Assets: What the company owns, such as cash, crypto, real estate, inventory, etc.Liabilities: What the company owes, such as loans, unpaid bills and taxesEquity: What’s left after subtracting liabilities from assets (net worth).For example, if you own $50,000 worth of crypto, and at the same time, you owe someone $20,000. In this case, your equity is $30,000. Balance sheets help you understand your financial position at a glance. They’re essential for filing taxes, attracting investors, applying for loans and complying with regulations. Balance sheets are essential in countries like the United States, where businesses must report crypto holdings accurately for tax and compliance reasons. Similarly, in the UK, European countries and Canada, balance sheets are important for businesses and are often used by individuals, especially when dealing with crypto assets. It’s not just for taxes. A well-maintained balance sheet can help you get funding, plan your finances, or simply sleep better knowing where you stand at night.How do you treat crypto on a balance sheet?One of the most common questions when preparing a balance sheet is, “How to report crypto trading gains and losses on a balance sheet?” In most jurisdictions, the crypto reporting and taxation rules are still to be decided or clarified. This also applies to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which lack definitive guidance concerning cryptocurrency accounting.As cryptocurrencies are considered assets in many jurisdictions, the fundamental concepts of accounting for assets could apply when preparing a balance sheet involving crypto transactions. Below is an example of a simplified crypto balance sheet treatment and some helpful pointers that may assist you in accounting for crypto trading in 2025.Notes to the balance sheet:Cash ($15,000): Represents fiat currency (e.g., USD) held in bank accounts or wallets, including proceeds from selling crypto or other revenue.Cryptocurrency ($20,000): Recorded at cost basis (fair market value at acquisition, less any impairment). Includes 0.5 Bitcoin (BTC) purchased at $30,000 each ($15,000 total) and 10 Ether (ETH) purchased at $500 each ($5,000 total). No impairment has been recorded, assuming the fair market value (FMV) remains above cost.Mining equipment ($5,000): Capitalized cost of crypto mining hardware, net of depreciation. The original cost was $8,000, with $3,000 accumulated depreciation over two years.Accounts payable ($2,000): Unpaid bills (e.g., for electricity or supplier services related to crypto mining operations).Taxes payable ($1,500): Estimated tax liability for realized crypto gains (e.g., from selling 0.1 BTC at a $2,000 gain, taxed at 20% long-term capital gains rate for simplicity).Retained earnings ($36,500): Accumulated profits, including crypto-related income (e.g., mining revenue, realized gains) minus expenses and taxes. Reflects net income from prior and current periods.When buying cryptocurrency with fiat moneyWhen you buy cryptocurrency with fiat money, such as dollars or euros, you’re simply exchanging one type of asset, such as cash, for another, like crypto or stocks. On your balance sheet, cryptocurrency trading activities should be recorded similarly to those of stock trading activities. As with stocks, you should record cryptocurrency on your balance sheet at its fair market value on the day of purchase. While your cash account displays a credit for the same amount, the cryptocurrency is recorded as a debit to your assets account.When selling cryptocurrency for fiat moneySelling crypto for fiat creates a change in your balance sheet: Your crypto holdings will be reduced, meaning credited, and your cash will increase, which also means that the account will be credited.If you sell for more than you paid (the original price of a token), you have a gain; if you sell for less, you record a loss. Both crypto gains and crypto losses should be tracked carefully for tax and reporting purposes.How to record crypto lossesThe difference is recorded as a loss when you sell crypto at a lower price than you bought it for. In some countries, these losses can lower your taxable income, so it can prove useful to properly document them.  However, even if the asset regains its previous price levels, impairment losses cannot be undone in accordance with GAAP’s accounting rules for intangible assets.This contrasts with IFRS, where certain intangible assets can be revalued upward under IAS 38 if an active market exists. However, crypto markets are volatile, and IFRS guidance on crypto revaluation remains unclear, so most entities stick to cost-less impairment. Businesses should consult local accounting standards and auditors for precise treatment.How to record crypto profitsIf you receive cryptocurrency as payment for goods, services or other activities, it’s treated as income at the fair market value on the date you receive it. This value is recorded as revenue and added to your assets. Later, if you sell or swap the crypto, any difference in value will result in a capital gain or loss.How to record crypto mining When cryptocurrency mining income occurs, it should be reported at the currency’s fair market value. This revenue should be shown on your income statement since it increases your assets.Similar to other revenue-generating activities, companies engaged in cryptocurrency mining are required to report their crypto profits on their balance sheet. Their mining income account will be credited as a result. Subsequently, the newly generated digital asset has to be recorded in their accounts at its fair market value.Additionally, costs related to mining operations should be recorded. For example, the cash account needs to be credited if cash is spent to cover mining costs. The purchase of mining equipment, which requires capitalization and amortization, will subsequently be deducted from the associated asset account or otherwise documented as a cost for items like utilities and supplies.Using cryptocurrency to pay suppliersPaying suppliers or vendors with cryptocurrency is like selling the asset since you have to recognize any gain or loss in relation to its original value. Therefore, the difference between the asset’s book value and its expense will be recorded as a capital gain.How to record transaction fees and exchange rates It’s critical to keep track of transaction costs and exchange rate fluctuations when trading or exchanging cryptocurrencies. Fees should be shown as an expense on the balance sheet since they lower your net gain or increase your loss. Changes in exchange rates may also have an impact on the value recorded when converting cryptocurrency into fiat, which could have an effect on your taxes and capital gains.Did you know? Cryptocurrency held for more than a year can be categorized as a long-term asset on your balance sheet in some jurisdictions, which may result in better tax treatment than short-term holdings.How are cryptocurrencies taxed?Taxation of cryptocurrencies varies by country, but your balance sheet plays a crucial role in tracking taxable events. Under current GAAP, crypto is recorded at cost and tested for impairment. IFRS allows revaluation in rare cases, but most entities use the cost model. For traders holding crypto as inventory, GAAP (ASC 330) or IFRS (IAS 2) may apply, with FMV adjustments. The lack of definitive guidance means businesses must apply judgment and document assumptions clearly. In the US, crypto is treated as property, with taxes applied to capital gains when selling or trading. The Internal Revenue Service requires reporting on your balance sheet; losses can offset gains. Also, the US introduced Form 1099-DA in 2025 for crypto brokers to report transactions, increasing compliance requirements. In the UK, cryptocurrencies are taxed under capital gains for individuals, while income tax may apply if trading is frequent or when crypto is received as income, such as through mining, staking or as payment for services.Canada follows a similar approach, taxing crypto as capital gains (50% inclusion rate) or business income for active traders. Mining income is taxable as income.In Germany, long-term holders (over a year) pay no tax on capital gains, but short-term trades over 600 euros are taxed. Notably, the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation (effective 2024) standardizes crypto reporting, impacting balance sheet documentation in member states.Accounting for Ethereum transactionsEthereum, the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts, has unique accounting needs. Here’s how to handle common Ethereum transactions on your balance sheet:Staking rewards: Staking ETH on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network generates rewards, treated as income at FMV when received. For example, receiving 0.1 ETH as a staking reward debits your “Cryptocurrency” asset account and credits “Revenue” on your income statement. Selling staked ETH later triggers a capital gain or loss.Gas fees: Ethereum transactions incur gas fees, which are expenses. Record these as a debit to “Transaction Fees” (an expense account) and a credit to “Cash” or “Cryptocurrency” if paid in ETH. For example, a $50 gas fee paid in ETH reduces your ETH holdings and is expensed.DeFi transactions: Yield farming or liquidity provision (e.g., on Uniswap) generates rewards, treated as income at FMV when received. For example, earning 100 UNI (UNI) tokens ($1,000) debits “Cryptocurrency” and credits “Revenue.” Track gas fees and token swaps as expenses or taxable events.ERC-20 tokens: Ethereum-based tokens (e.g., USDC, LINK) are separate assets. Record each at its FMV at acquisition, like ETH, and track them individually to avoid confusion.Accurate tracking of Ethereum transactions ensures compliance, especially with increased IRS scrutiny on staking and DeFi in 2025.Tools and best practices for crypto accountingManaging crypto transactions can be daunting, but these tools and tips simplify the process:Accounting software: Use platforms like CoinTracker, Koinly or CryptoTaxCalculator to track Ethereum transactions, calculate gains/losses, and generate tax reports. These tools integrate with wallets and exchanges, ensuring accurate FMV records.Regular reconciliation: Match your balance sheet’s crypto holdings to wallet/exchange records monthly to catch errors, especially for gas fees or staking rewards.Work with professionals: Crypto tax rules, especially for Ethereum’s DeFi and staking, are complex. Consult a crypto-savvy accountant to ensure compliance with IRS, His Majesty’s Revenue & Customs or other regulations.Document everything: Keep records of every Ethereum transaction, including FMV, gas fees and staking rewards, to prepare for audits or Form 1099-DA reporting in 2025.By staying organized, you’ll minimize errors and stress when filing taxes or preparing financial statements.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-trading-gains-and-losses-on-balance-sheet?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-21T15:00:00.000Z,"Crypto&#039;s real momentum isn&#039;t in the charts; it&#039;s in developer activity","Opinion by: Markus Levin, co-founder of XYOThe crypto community often experiences periods of heightened anxiety. Market downturns are often triggered by counterproductive sentiment-driven events rather than by fundamental issues, creating a significant disconnect between price behavior and the actual progress being made within the industry by the companies within it. What often goes unnoticed is how much real development happens during these downturns. While market movements capture most of the attention, teams are building faster and more deliberately behind the scenes than ever. The focus shifts away from price speculation and toward real execution. Growth happens during downturns. It's a necessary phase for projects that thrive in a volatile industry. They re-focus attention on refining their technology and business, fueling the next wave of progress.As a result, there's a disconnect between online sentiment and conversations between blockchain industry leaders. For builders and project leaders, the atmosphere is of determination, not doom.Regulators are coming on boardOne of the most promising developments is the accelerating momentum of regulation policy. Many European companies are applying for MiCA licenses in preparation for regulatory updates. There's also a significant policy shift under new US leadership as the SEC retreats from several high-profile crypto enforcement actions. The disparity between sentiment and reality serves as a reminder that price is a lagging indicator. Selloffs are triggered by uncertainty around tariff announcements and background activity such as interest rates. Material, long-term statistics speak for the virtually universal optimism among industry leaders as the number of active developers has remained stable, and the number of established developers almost doubled last year. That's an incredible jump in only one year. From hype to substanceMaturation means teams thoughtfully building, governments engaging seriously with legislation, and users demanding better UX and real utility. The industry has a well-established pattern — market corrections wipe away hype and encourage focus. The last bear market gave rise to breakthroughs in DeFi, NFTs, and zero-knowledge tech. This time, it's about real-world infrastructure, regulation-ready platforms, and next-gen scalability.What emerges in these periods tends to be less visible but more durable. Teams that remain active are often those with clear models, sufficient runway, and a willingness to adapt. These are the periods when we learn whether the systems being built can handle real-world demands. One of the most promising frontiers lies at the intersection of AI and blockchain, the most ubiquitous being within Large Language Models. AI is, however, only as good as the data it's trained on.AI systems are evolving rapidly, but their foundations are skewed. They're built primarily on data scraped from the digital-first countries that predominantly lie in the northern hemisphere, which dominates global media production and internet usage. This creates a feedback loop where Western and East Asian perspectives and widely spoken languages such as English and Mandarin are not only amplified but leave little room for necessary data from smaller populations.A report from Web3 Technologies said 60% of tier-one media on the internet is English. Prominent among these media outlets is The New York Times, which has sued OpenAI based on copyright infringement. The publication alleges that their copyright-protected data was used to train OpenAI's LLM model. Recent: The future of finance is built on Bitcoin — Ethereum was just the testnetKnowing the full extent of the global imbalance in the data creating AI outputs is impossible. Allegations like this and the results delivered when using AI tools suggest the pressing need for a solution.It's even worse. When AI systems are trained on narrow, incomplete data sets, the results can exclude billions from the benefits of emerging technologies. As IBM highlights, data bias isn't just a technical issue — it's a human one with real-world consequences in healthcare, finance, agriculture, and beyond.It's become normal to use AI data every day. We receive personalized Google search results, Adobe has built AI into its industry-standard graphic and video software, and we use AI assistants like Gemini, Grok, and ChatGPT to formulate the thoughts with which we represent ourselves. All of these tools are affected by an overwhelming bias toward the center of a bell curve within their data sets, unable to access or address less common use cases.A popular example demonstrates this issue: Until recently, image generators could not create a full wine glass. No matter what prompt you provided, a wine glass full to the edge was beyond the capabilities of all known generative AI software because they had never been provided photos of wine glasses full to the brim. Their data sets had to be updated to correct this comical problem, which revealed a much more serious one.Decentralized data offers a solution. Globally incentivized systems like DePINs enable the participation of populations that would otherwise remain underserved, allowing the valuable data they provide to come online. This improves the service for everyone, making smaller global communities more accessible to commerce and enabling them easier access to the rest of the world. It also empowers smaller data creators to monetize their data rather than relinquishing it to tech giants. Where do we go from here?The crypto industry is entering a new phase. A phase that's more productive and sustainable. Expect to see rapid growth in working infrastructure, platforms and applications that welcome knowledgeable, consumer-friendly regulations and projects that respect the time and money of their users.Opportunities within the crypto space are changing but not shrinking. Our opportunities grow as we learn from what has not worked in the last few years. They will take time to develop, but successful builders will focus on long-term, incremental change and sound business practices rather than chasing fads and short-term profits.The momentum of real progress has never been stronger, and it is precisely during times like these, when it feels like no one's watching, that the foundations of the future are laid.Opinion by: Markus Levin, co-founder of XYO.

2025-05-21T14:00:55.000Z,"AI tool claims 97% efficacy in preventing ‘address poisoning’ attacks","Crypto cybersecurity firm Trugard and onchain trust protocol Webacy have developed an artificial intelligence-based system for detecting crypto wallet address poisoning.According to a May 21 announcement shared with Cointelegraph, the new tool is part of Webacy’s crypto decisioning tools and “leverages a supervised machine learning model trained on live transaction data in conjunction with onchain analytics, feature engineering and behavioral context.” The new tool purportedly has a success score of 97%, tested across known attack cases. “Address poisoning is one of the most underreported yet costly scams in crypto, and it preys on the simplest assumption: That what you see is what you get,” said Webacy co-founder Maika Isogawa.Address poisoning detection infographic. Source: Trugard and WebacyCrypto address poisoning is a scam where attackers send small amounts of cryptocurrency from a wallet address that closely resembles a target’s real address, often with the same starting and ending characters. The goal is to trick the user into accidentally copying and reusing the attacker’s address in future transactions, resulting in lost funds.The technique exploits how users often rely on partial address matching or clipboard history when sending crypto. A January 2025 study found that over 270 million poisoning attempts occurred on BNB Chain and Ethereum between July 1, 2022, and June 30, 2024. Of those, 6,000 attempts were successful, leading to losses over $83 million.Related: What are address poisoning attacks in crypto and how to avoid them?Web2 security in a Web3 worldTrugard chief technology officer Jeremiah O’Connor told Cointelegraph that the team brings deep cybersecurity expertise from the Web2 world, which they’ve been “applying to Web3 data since the early days of crypto.” The team is applying its experience with algorithmic feature engineering from traditional systems to Web3. He added:“Most existing Web3 attack detection systems rely on static rules or basic transaction filtering. These methods often fall behind evolving attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures.“The newly developed system instead leverages machine learning to create a system that learns and adapts to address poisoning attacks. O’Connor highlighted that what sets their system apart is “its emphasis on context and pattern recognition.” Isogawa explained that “AI can detect patterns often beyond the reach of human analysis.”Related: Jameson Lopp sounds alarm on Bitcoin address poisoning attacksThe machine learning approachO’Connor said Trugard generated synthetic training data for the AI to simulate various attack patterns. Then the model was trained through supervised learning, a type of machine learning where a model is trained on labeled data, including input variables and the correct output.In such a setup, the goal is for the model to learn the relationship between inputs and outputs to predict the correct output for new, unseen inputs. Common examples include spam detection, image classification and price prediction.O’Connor said the model is also updated by training it on new data as new strategies emerge. “To top it off, we’ve built a synthetic data generation layer that lets us continuously test the model against simulated poisoning scenarios,” he said. “This has proven incredibly effective in helping the model generalize and stay robust over time.“Magazine: Crypto-Sec: Phishing scammer goes after Hedera users, address poisoner gets $70K",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-system-has-97-claimed-efficacy-in-preventing-address-poisoning-attacks?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

After failing to gain support from key Democrats on May 8, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act passed the US Senate in a 66–32 procedural vote on May 20 and is now heading to a debate on the Senate floor.The bill seeks to set clear rules for stablecoin collateralization and mandate compliance with Anti-Money Laundering laws.Related: German gov’t missed out on $2.3B profit after selling Bitcoin at $57K“This act doesn’t just regulate stablecoins, it legitimizes them,” said Andrei Grachev, managing partner at DWF Labs and Falcon Finance.“It sets clear rules, and with clarity comes confidence.

Monthly remittances typically range from $131 to $648, representing between 6% and 23% of the sender’s average income.“Remittances are lifelines in this region, but they’re broken,” Lapchik told Cointelegraph. “Guatemala alone sees $21 billion in remittances every year, and families are losing 6% to 10% of that to fees and delays. These are people sending $300, $400 a month, and they can’t afford to wait days or pay that much just to get money home,” he said, adding:“Crypto solves this when it’s used the right way. It lets us move money instantly and at a fraction of the cost, integrated into the bank apps people already use.” Latin America is the second-fastest growing region in terms of crypto adoption, though Guatemala lags behind regional leaders Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia, according to a 2024 Chainalysis study.The study cited stablecoins as a primary adoption driver in the region. Crypto adoption in Latin America by total value received.

Pendle now accounts for 30% of all yield-bearing stablecoin total value locked (TVL), roughly $3 billion, the firm said in a report shared with Cointelegraph.  Pendle noted that stablecoins make up 83% of its $4 billion total value locked, a sharp rise from less than 20% just a year ago. In contrast, assets such as Ether (ETH), which historically contributed 80–90% of Pendle’s TVL, have shrunk to less than 10% of its TVL.Traditional stablecoins like USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC) do not pass on interest to holders.

The platform will be powered by Maia, an AI core engine developed by My Aion, and aims to optimize and manage systems across mobility, energy, education, healthcare and digital services. My Aion CEO Daniele Marinelli said the AI will know the user well enough to “recommend the perfect place for your anniversary dinner and book it for you without you lifting a finger.”The project will debut in Abu Dhabi before expanding internationally. It is expected to launch in 18 months. Multibillion-dollar AI project to create jobs for UAE nationalsThe project is structured under a $2.5 billion Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) model, a public-private partnership model for large-scale infrastructure and technology projects. Under the model, private sector entities construct the infrastructure, run and manage the system for a certain period. The companies usually recoup their investments and earn profits during the operational phase. At the end of the period set by the parties involved, ownership and control of the systems developed through the BOT model are transferred to the government or a public sector entity. Bold Technologies CEO Thani Al Thani Al Falasi said the initiative will support UAE job creation. “This initiative will support job creation for UAE nationals, foster local innovation and contribute meaningfully to the national AI ecosystem,” he said. My Aion’s Marinelli said that relocating to Abu Dhabi provides their global operations with a new chapter. “The UAE offers the infrastructure and institutional support needed to scale responsibly and strategically,” Marinelli said.Cointelegraph has reached out to Bold Technologies and My Aion for more information. Related: Decentralized OORT AI data hits top ranks on Google KaggleCrypto proponents say AI could benefit from digital assetsOn May 20, Catena Labs, a project led by Circle co-founder Sean Neville, announced that it will create an AI-native financial institution.

The SEC official said that mirrors how streaming platforms compensate musicians and filmmakers. “Just as streaming platforms pay royalties to the creator of a song or video each time a user plays it, an NFT can enable artists to benefit from the appreciation in the value of their work after its initial sale,” Peirce said. Peirce added that the feature does not provide NFT owners any rights or interest in any business enterprise or profits “traditionally associated with securities.”SEC never prohibited NFT royaltiesOscar Franklin Tan, chief legal officer of Enjin core contributor Atlas Development Services, told Cointelegraph that the recent remarks by Peirce on NFTs and creator royalties have been widely misunderstood. Peirce had clarified that NFTs that send resale royalties to artists are not necessarily securities, a view Tan says is legally sound but mischaracterized in some media reports. “So Hester Peirce said that an NFT that sends royalties back to the creator after a sale is not a security. This is correct, but the way some media reported this is completely out of context,” Tan told Cointelegraph. “The actual context is that this is not controversial, and it was never considered a security.”The lawyer said US securities law focuses on regulating investments and not compensating creators for their work. “The artist or creator is not an investor, not a passive third party in the NFT,” he said, noting that royalty payments are not considered investment income. Instead, Tan told Cointelegraph that this type of earning is “analogous to business income,” which the SEC does not regulate. He added: “The SEC never prohibited contracts where artists and creators get royalties from secondary sales of their work, not royalties from paper contracts or blockchain protocols.”Tan explained that the legal distinction becomes more complicated when NFTs promise shared profits from royalties to multiple holders beyond the original creator. Tan also urged regulators and market participants to apply traditional legal reasoning to new blockchain technologies. “Ask yourself, if this were done by pen and paper instead of blockchain, would there still be a regulatory issue?” he said. “If none, slow down.”Source: Oscar Franklin TanRelated: SEC charges Unicoin crypto platform over alleged $100 million fraudOpenSea calls on the SEC to exempt NFT marketplaces from oversightWhile NFT royalties may not have been a controversial SEC issue, NFT marketplaces are a different case. In August 2024, NFT trading platform OpenSea received a Wells notice from the SEC, alleging that NFTs traded on the marketplace could qualify as unregistered securities. On Feb. 22, OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer announced that the SEC has officially closed its investigation into the platform. The executive said that this was a win for the industry. Following the conclusion of the SEC’s investigation, OpenSea’s lawyers penned a letter to Peirce, who leads the SEC’s Crypto Task Force. OpenSea general counsel Adele Faure and deputy general counsel Laura Brookover said in an April 9 letter that NFT marketplaces don’t qualify as brokers under US securities laws. The lawyers said the marketplaces don’t execute transactions or act as intermediaries. The lawyers urged the SEC to “clearly state that NFT marketplaces like OpenSea do not qualify as exchanges under federal securities laws.”Magazine: NBA star Tristan Thompson misses $32B in Bitcoin by taking $82M contract in cash",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/nft-royalties-not-securities-sec-peirce?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-21T08:27:53.000Z,"South Korea tightens crypto rules ahead of institutional market entry","South Korea is tightening rules around digital asset transactions as it prepares to allow institutional players into its crypto market, introducing new guidelines for nonprofit crypto sales and stricter listing standards for exchanges.On May 20, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) of South Korea said during its fourth Virtual Asset Committee meeting that it had finalized sweeping new measures.Set to take effect in June, the updated rules allow both nonprofit organizations and virtual asset exchanges to sell cryptocurrencies, but under new compliance standards.Nonprofit entities must have at least five years of audited financial history to be permitted to receive and sell virtual asset donations. They will also need to establish internal Donation Review Committees to assess the appropriateness of each donation and the liquidation strategy.To reduce risks of money laundering, all donations must be routed through verified Korean won exchange accounts, with verification responsibilities placed on banks, exchanges and the nonprofits themselves.Furthermore, only cryptocurrencies listed on at least three major domestic exchanges will be eligible, and liquidation is expected to occur immediately upon receipt.Guidelines regarding nonprofits selling crypto donations. Source: FSCRelated: Top South Korean presidential hopefuls support legalizing Bitcoin ETFsExchange sales to be restrictedCrypto exchanges will be allowed to liquidate user fees paid in crypto, but only to cover operational costs. Sales will be capped at daily limits, typically no more than 10% of the total planned amount.Furthermore, sales will only be permitted for the top 20 tokens by market cap across five won-based exchanges. Importantly, exchanges are barred from selling tokens on their own platforms to prevent conflicts of interest.South Korea is also tightening standards for listing digital assets. The revised rules aim to curb instability from sudden price spikes by requiring a minimum circulating supply before a token is allowed to trade and temporarily restricting market orders post-listing.So-called zombie tokens (with low volume and thin market caps) and memecoins without clear utility will face more scrutiny. For instance, exchanges must delist tokens if they fail to meet liquidity benchmarks or community engagement thresholds.Starting in June, exchanges and nonprofits can apply for real-name accounts to facilitate these sales. Later this year, the FSC plans to extend real-name accounts to listed firms and professional investors.Cointelegraph contacted South Korea’s Digital Asset eXchange Association for comment, but had not received a response by publication.Related: RedotPay enters South Korea with crypto-powered payment cardsSouth Korean candidates push pro-crypto agendaSouth Korea’s Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung has proposed launching a stablecoin pegged to the Korean won, aiming to curb capital flight and bolster the country’s financial autonomy.Speaking at a recent policy forum, Lee said a won-based stablecoin could help retain domestic wealth and reduce dependence on foreign-backed digital currencies such as USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC).The initiative is part of Lee’s broader push for digital asset reforms, which also includes legalizing spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs).His rival, Kim Moon-soo of the ruling People Power Party, has also expressed support for introducing spot crypto ETFs, signaling bipartisan momentum on the issue.Magazine: NBA star Tristan Thompson misses $32B in Bitcoin by taking $82M contract in cash",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/south-korea-tightens-kyc-rules-ahead-of-institutional-crypto-entry?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-21T07:35:00.000Z,"Why crypto transfers can fail and what you must check before sending","Why crypto transfers can fail and what you must check before sending              Crypto transfers fail more often than most people realize, but user attentiveness can stop most losses.What’s often marketed as a seamless, borderless system can become frustrating when transfers fail, with no customer service hotline to call and no easy recourse to reverse mistakes. In the crypto universe, the burden of getting it right falls squarely on the shoulders of the user.But here’s the encouraging part: Most failures are preventable. Understanding why crypto transfers fail can help users avoid costly missteps, navigate the quirks of different networks and send funds with far greater confidence. With a little preparation, you can sidestep common pitfalls and take control of your crypto experience.Did you know? According to a recent survey, 37% of people cite security risks as the most significant barrier to adopting crypto for payments, a reminder of how crucial it is to prioritize security at every step.                   Common crypto transfer mistakes              A single slip — wrong address, wrong network or underpaid fee — tops the list of costly crypto-transfer mistakes.Here’s a quick look at common crypto transfer mistakes:Sending crypto to the wrong address: Blockchain transactions are irreversible. A single wrong character in the recipient’s wallet address can send funds into the void, or worse, into a stranger’s wallet.Choosing the wrong network: Sending Tether USDt (USDT) over Ethereum instead of Tron? That’s a classic mistake. Always match the network to your recipient’s supported network.Underpaying gas or fees: Lowballing crypto gas fees, also known as blockchain transaction fees, can leave your transaction stuck or pending indefinitely.Not double-checking wallet compatibility: Some wallets can’t handle certain tokens or blockchains. Always verify.Sending tokens on the wrong network — like Ethereum instead of BNB Chain — can result in permanent loss. One user learned this the hard way (as shown in the image above) after transferring crypto to Coinbase from Binance using an unsupported network.                  Failed crypto transaction explained              Even perfect-looking transactions can crumble if gas is too low, a smart contract glitches or network congestion spikes.A failed crypto transaction can happen even if all the input details seem right. One major reason is insufficient gas fees. If the gas you set is too low, blockchain validators may ignore your transaction entirely. In some cases, this causes the transaction to fail outright; in others, it remains stuck in a pending state for hours or even days.Smart contract hiccups are another hidden landmine, especially in the decentralized finance (DeFi) world. If the contract’s code has flaws or can’t handle your input, your transaction can bounce back. Add in network congestion — especially on high-traffic chains like Ethereum, where every block is a battle for space — and even well-planned transfers can stall or fail without warning.Did You Know? A study analyzing over 1.5 billion failed transactions on the Solana blockchain found that bot spamming and network congestion were significant contributors to transaction failures.                  Crypto transfer troubleshooting guide              A quick five-point checklist (address, network, explorer status, wallet queue, asset support) usually reveals why funds haven’t landed.If your crypto transfer isn’t received, don’t panic. Check these first:Confirm the recipient’s address is correct.Verify the transfer network (was it Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon, etc.).Check the status on a block explorer (like Etherscan for Ethereum or Solscan for Solana).Review your wallet and see if the transfer is still pending.Make sure the recipient wallet supports the asset you sent.If you catch an issue early, some platforms allow you to speed up or cancel a stuck transaction by paying a higher gas fee.What to check before sending cryptoPrevention is your best friend.Before sending any crypto, take a few moments to verify all the critical details. Always double-check the recipient’s wallet address. The safest method is copy-paste; never type it out manually. Ensure that the address belongs to the correct network and is compatible with the token you’re sending.Make sure the address matches the right network and can handle the token you’re sending. And don’t forget the fees. On Ethereum, for example, you’ll need some ETH in your wallet to cover gas or that transfer’s going nowhere. Also, confirm the receiving wallet can accept the token and that you're not hitting any daily or regional transfer limits imposed by the platform.Did You Know? A single copy-paste mistake cost one crypto trader $26 million in Renzo Restaked ETH (ezETH). The tokens were sent to the wrong wallet address, and recovery was impossible, even with white hat hackers trying to help.                  Crypto transfer speed and networks              Different blockchains clear at various speeds, so match your urgency to a network’s typical confirmation time.Chains like Solana, Avalanche and Tron blaze through transactions in seconds, leaving older titans like Bitcoin and Ethereum catching their breath, especially when network traffic spikes and block space gets tight. And they’re not alone. Newer players like Aptos and Sui are also pushing the limits of scale and throughput, signaling a fierce race for speed across the crypto ecosystem.That’s why knowing the average speed of the network you’re using matters. Sending Bitcoin (BTC)? Expect to wait around 10 minutes per confirmation, there are 6 of them. Moving USDT on Solana? It should arrive almost instantly. Being aware of these differences helps set realistic expectations and avoid unnecessary panic when a transfer lags. And when every second counts — whether you’re racing to secure a trade or make a payment — choosing a fast crypto network can save you time and stress.                  How the crypto Travel Rule can cause transfer failures              Regulatory hurdles like the Travel Rule can freeze transfers if sender or recipient data doesn’t line up across jurisdictions.The crypto Travel Rule requires virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to share key details about the sender and recipient when handling transfers above set limits. If that information is missing, incomplete, or doesn’t match up, your transaction can hit a wall, often getting delayed or blocked entirely. This issue pops up frequently in cross-border transfers or when moving funds to exchanges.Other problems arise from the “sunrise issue,” where some countries have adopted the Travel Rule and others haven’t. This mismatch can lead to compliance conflicts and blocked transactions. Self-hosted wallets also present a challenge: Some VASPs won’t process transfers to wallets they can’t verify. As regulations tighten, expect more of these friction points in crypto transfers.Did you know? A report by Cointelegraph Research and Onramper found that 50% of fiat-to-crypto transactions fail, even when users have completed Know Your Customer (KYC) checks. User location, banking restrictions and local regulations all play a role in whether those transactions succeed or collapse.                   How to avoid failed crypto transactions              Send a test amount, watch live gas trackers and never rush. Slow, informed moves keep transactions from failing.Avoiding failed transactions comes down to awareness and caution. First, always test with a small amount before transferring large sums. This gives you a chance to catch mistakes without losing much. Second, always monitor current gas fees, especially on volatile networks like Ethereum. Tools like Etherscan Gas Tracker and Blocknative Gas Estimator give live Ethereum gas prices. Many wallets (like MetaMask) also show gas estimates in the app. Using a reputable crypto wallet that offers real-time fee suggestions and transaction previews helps immensely. Finally, take your time. Many failed transactions happen simply because users are in a rush or feeling pressured to act fast. In crypto, speed can kill your funds.Did you know? One user paid $200 in gas fees on Ethereum for a failed transaction that returned nothing. The cause? Slippage settings were off, and the network still charged full fees.                  How to verify a crypto transfer              Plug the transaction hash into a block explorer for an instant verdict on whether your transfer is pending, confirmed or failed.Once you send crypto, the transaction hash becomes your receipt. Paste it into a block explorer of the chain you used, like Etherscan, Solscan or Tronscan, to get live updates. This will tell you if the transaction is pending, confirmed or failed, along with timestamps, block numbers and fee details.Some wallets and exchanges now offer built-in tracking tools that integrate directly with explorers. These make it easier for beginners to stay informed without needing to navigate third-party websites. If a transfer seems stuck, checking the status this way should always be your first move.                  Mastering crypto transfers: Confidence over chaos              Triple-checking details, monitoring fees and staying curious turns crypto transfers from a gamble into a confident routine. One wrong digit, one wrong network, and your funds could vanish into the void. This isn’t just about saving your wallet; it’s about owning your peace of mind.As blockchains scale and regulations tighten, the winners are those who move smart, not just fast. So here’s the vibe: Slow down to level up. Triple-check that address. Know the platform you’re using. Watch those fees. Stay cool when networks get jammed.The pros don’t rush; they prepare. Back up your keys. Keep your tools sharp. Stay curious and keep learning, because the crypto game rewards those who respect it.Master the flow, and you trade chaos for confidence. That’s when crypto becomes your playground.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/why-crypto-transfers-can-fail-and-what-you-must-check-before-sending?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

That means supporting the development of a more diverse, equitable, inclusive tech ecosystem. We must embrace this emerging technology and build on the success of our economy,” he added.Crypto legislation proposed in New York New York State lawmakers have already introduced several bills to regulate crypto. In April, Assemblyman Clyde Vanel introduced a bill to amend the state’s financial law to allow New York State agencies to accept crypto as payment. However, the legislation is yet to reach the state’s full House or Senate.New York state Senator James Sanders Jr proposed the Blockchain Study Act in February, which would create a crypto task force to investigate the current state of crypto in the State. It has yet to advance past the House. Related: Wintermute opens New York office, citing improved US crypto rulesAdams made digital assets a large part of his policy platform after assuming office in January 2022 and announced a plan to accept his first three paychecks in Bitcoin (BTC).

The case was dismissed with prejudice on April 2, meaning it can’t be reopened.An increasing number of US states are also working on crypto-related legislation, with at least 18 considering bills to establish a strategic Bitcoin Reserve.

2025-05-20T20:54:27.000Z,"Justin Sun to attend Trump&#039;s dinner with memecoin backers","After weeks of speculation among crypto enthusiasts and news outlets, Tron founder Justin Sun has claimed he owns the wallet that purchased the largest amount of Donald Trump’s memecoin, allowing him to qualify for a dinner and reception with the US president.In a May 19 X post, Sun said he had received an invitation to attend Trump’s dinner at his golf club outside Washington, DC, as part of a reward for the top 220 memecoin holders. The Tron founder claimed he controlled the top wallet on the TRUMP token leaderboard under the username “Sun,” which held roughly $19 million worth of the memecoin at a price of $13.20.According to Sun, he plans to network at the May 22 memecoin dinner, “talk crypto,” and “discuss the future” of the industry. It’s unclear why the Tron founder chose to announce his planned presence at the event now, when the leaderboard was finalized on May 12. Cointelegraph reached out to a spokesperson for Sun for comment, but had not received a response at the time of publication.Source: Justin SunThough not a surprise to many who speculated that Sun was the individual behind the memecoin purchases, his attendance at the dinner only deepens his ties to the Trump administration and the president’s family. In addition to the dinner for the 220 tokenholders, Trump said he would hold a reception and “VIP tour” for the top 25 wallets on the leaderboard.Related: What to expect at Trump’s memecoin dinnerSun spent $75 million on tokens through World Liberty Financial, the crypto platform backed by Trump’s three sons, including a $30 million investment a few weeks after the 2024 election. The Tron founder is also an adviser to the company.Before Trump won the November election, Sun had been facing a lawsuit from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed in 2023 over the alleged “orchestration of the unregistered offer and sale, manipulative trading, and unlawful touting of crypto asset securities.” In February, roughly a month after Trump took office and appointed Commissioner Mark Uyeda as acting chair of the SEC, the regulator and Sun jointly filed a motion for a federal judge to stay the case, which was granted.Memecoin’s potential conflicts of interest are affecting CongressSun’s and others’ involvement in Trump’s crypto ventures has prompted calls for investigations and oversight among many Democratic lawmakers, who argued that some individuals could use digital assets to essentially purchase influence with the president. The concerns initially slowed progress on a bill to regulate stablecoins in the Senate, the GENIUS Act, complicated by World Liberty Financial’s own stablecoin, USD1. The chamber voted to move forward on the bill on May 19, a few hours before Sun’s announcement.“How convenient: the day after the Senate advances the GENIUS Act, Justin Sun — a major investor in the Trump family crypto venture — announces he’s getting a private dinner as the president’s top crypto buyer,” said Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, according to Bloomberg. “It’s critical that everyone understands the GENIUS Act doesn’t stop this type of corruption — it greenlights it.”At a May 20 oversight hearing, Maryland Representative Glenn Ivey questioned SEC Chair Paul Atkins on Sun’s case being stayed, as well as his investments in World Liberty Financial and Trump’s memecoin. Though the case was stayed before Atkins was sworn in as chair, Ivey expressed concern about the timeline between Sun’s investments and the SEC not pursuing its own enforcement action.The memecoin dinner applicants are likely still subject to background checks before meeting Trump in person. As of May 20, those planning to attend included Kronos Research chief investment officer Vincent Liu, Hyperithm co-CEO Oh Sangrok, Synthetix founder Kain Warwick, a consultant named Vincent Deriu, crypto user Morten Christensen, a World Liberty Financial adviser going by the pseudonym “Ogle,” and a representative from the startup MemeCore.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/justin-sun-attend-trump-dinner-with-memecoin-backers?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-20T20:32:50.000Z,"Bitcoin open interest hits record high as bulls stampede toward new BTC price highs","Key takeaways:Bitcoin futures open interest hit a record $72 billion, signaling rising use of leverage among institutional investors.$1.2 billion in shorts at $107,000 to $108,000 are at risk of liquidation, boosting BTC’s breakout odds.The aggregate open interest in Bitcoin (BTC) futures surged to a record high on May 20, raising questions about whether bearish positions are now at risk. Despite repeated failures to break above the $107,000 level since May 18, the sheer volume of leveraged positions could propel Bitcoin to a new all-time high.Bitcoin futures aggregate open interest, USD. Source: CoinGlassThe total open interest in BTC futures climbed to $72 billion on May 20, marking an 8% increase from $66.6 billion just a week earlier. Institutional demand continues to be a major driver of this leverage, with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) leading at $16.9 billion in BTC futures, followed by Binance, which holds $12 billion in open interest.$1.2 billion in bearish BTC liquidations cluster at $107K–$108KAccording to CoinGlass estimates, the largest concentration of bearish BTC futures liquidations is clustered between $107,000 and $108,000, amounting to approximately $1.2 billion.Bitcoin futures leverage heatmap, USD million. Source: CoinGlassWhile it's impossible to predict what could spark a breakout above $108,000 to force those leveraged shorts to unwind, there is growing optimism tied to rising concerns over United States fiscal debt. Uncertainty remains about how the government plans to achieve economic growth while reducing spending, especially in light of ongoing disagreement between Democratic and Republican lawmakers.More importantly, yields on the 20-year US Treasury remain close to 5%, up from 4.82% two weeks earlier. Weak demand for long-term government debt may compel the US Federal Reserve to step in as the buyer of last resort to maintain market stability, reversing a 26-month trend. This approach puts downward pressure on the US dollar and drives investors to seek alternative hedging strategies, including Bitcoin.Gold dominates, but Bitcoin absorbs flow amid reserve reallocationsGold remains the dominant alternative asset, but its 24% year-to-date gains in 2025 and $22 trillion market capitalization make it less attractive to many investors. For context, the entire S&P 500 index is valued at $53 trillion, while US bank deposits and Treasury bills (M1) amount to $18.6 trillion. In contrast, Bitcoin currently represents a $2.1 trillion asset class, roughly equivalent in size to silver.Meanwhile, some regions, notably the US, have begun laying the groundwork to shift portions of their gold reserves into Bitcoin—an action that could easily propel BTC to a new all-time high. A modest 5% reallocation from gold into Bitcoin by those nations would translate into a $105 billion inflow, equivalent to 1 million BTC at a price of $105,000. Related: Bitcoin ready to ‘vaporize’ shorts once price discovery above $110K beginsFor perspective, Strategy, the US-listed firm led by Michael Saylor, currently holds 576,230 BTC. There is little doubt that institutional buying remains the primary catalyst for Bitcoin to break above the $108,000 level. Such a move would trigger the liquidation of heavily leveraged bearish positions, likely accelerating the push to a new all-time high. However, persistent macroeconomic uncertainty continues to weigh on overall investor sentiment.As Bitcoin flirts with the $107,000 mark, those holding short positions face heightened risk of forced liquidations—an outcome that could further fuel upward momentum in price.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.
