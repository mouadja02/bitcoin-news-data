2025-05-22T00:30:55.000Z,"Solana Eyes $1,000 — But MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Bitcoin May Hit Their Targets First","With Solana’s price eyeing a four-figure milestone, the spotlight is shifting to a handful of tokens that are drawing heavy whale accumulation and analyst attention for 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE is leading the charge as Stage 8 nears completion, while XRP and Bitcoin continue to build institutional momentum. NEAR Protocol is also gaining traction, but it’s MAGA, XRP, SOL, and BTC that are now at the center of the next big crypto cycle. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is the Coin to Watch Before Stage 9 MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing serious attention as Stage 8 approaches its final phase, with over $8 million raised and a hard listing target of $0.007. Unlike legacy coins where much of the upside is already priced in, MAGA offers structured scarcity, surging demand, and transparent price discovery. Analysts are projecting a 35x–40x ROI from current levels, with some models suggesting even greater upside if listing momentum continues. Whale allocations, rapid presale sellouts, and a capped 100 billion token supply audited by HashEx are positioning MAGACOIN FINANCE as a rare ground-floor opportunity for Q2 and Q3 2025. Bitcoin: Macro Momentum and Whale Accumulation Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $103,405, having gained over 14% in the past 30 days and holding well above $100,000 7 . On-chain data shows major wallets accumulating, with ETF inflows stabilizing and analysts forecasting a plausible rally toward $150,000 if current trends hold. As Bitcoin’s macro narrative strengthens, early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE are benefitting from increased capital rotation. XRP: Derivatives, ETFs, and Global Settlement XRP is trading at $2.35, with whales accumulating over 880 million tokens in May alone. The launch of CME futures and growing ETF speculation are fueling institutional interest, while legal clarity and Ripple’s expanding partnerships are setting the stage for XRP to serve as a global settlement infrastructure asset. Analysts forecast a move to $2.85 by June and $5.50 by year-end, with $15 as a stretch target if ETF adoption accelerates. As institutional flows grow, many investors are also rotating into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for greater upside. Solana: Whale Accumulation and Technical Breakout Solana (SOL) is trading at $169.25, up 1.84% in the last 24 hours, and has rebounded over 50% from recent lows. Whale accumulation is accelerating, with large wallets withdrawing over 145,000 SOL from exchanges and analysts now eyeing the $200 level as a short-term target. While $1,000 remains a bold call, Solana’s bullish momentum is undeniable, but the most aggressive capital is also moving into MAGACOIN FINANCE for earlier, higher-multiple potential. NEAR Protocol: Quiet Growth and Breakout Potential NEAR Protocol (NEAR) is trading at $2.76, up 1% in the past 24 hours. Its developer ecosystem and integrations are expanding, but NEAR still lags the market leaders in momentum. As capital seeks undervalued networks, many NEAR holders are also looking to MAGACOIN FINANCE for early-stage, high-upside exposure. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW Conclusion Smart capital is converging around MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, Solana, and Bitcoin as the top altcoin picks for the 2025 bull run. With Stage 8 nearly full, robust demand, and a clear listing roadmap, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the most compelling early-stage opportunity of the year. The window for entry is closing—and those watching closely know this could be the cycle’s defining moment.

The rising optimism of an altseason amid the re-emergence of FOMO traders will help $B sustain bullish sentiment. A recently launched memecoin on the BSC chain dubbed BUILDon (B) rallied over 150 percent in the last 24 hours to trade above $0.1 on Wednesday, during the late North American trading session. The small-cap memecoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $102 million and a 24-hour average traded volume of about $60 million, recorded staggering gains after an endorsement from Donald Trump-backed World Liberty Financial (WLFI). According to an X post, the WLFI project purchased an undisclosed amount of $B tokens following its recent move to use the USD1 stablecoin as its base pair. “We just bought some $B to support the BUILDon team. Love seeing projects choose $USD1 as their base pair — faster settlement, deeper liquidity, and growth every day. We hope to see more tokens make the switch,” the announcement noted . What Next for BUILDon Following the WLFI Support The BUILDon memecoin has attracted more than 13k on-chain holders after a net pooled USD1 of over 842k to provide liquidity. The BSC mascot is well positioned to rally further in the coming days amid the rising demand for memecoins following the Bitcoin price pump towards a new all-time high. https://twitter.com/buildonbsc_ai/status/1925314302292238396?s=46 Furthermore, the memecoin culture on the BNB chain has gained significant traction in the recent past following the deliberate decision by Binance to support project developers.

2025-05-22T00:00:45.000Z,"$500 into $500K? MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Cardano Are Still Considered Major Summer Setups","As Bitcoin’s latest rally fuels confidence across the market, investors are scanning for the next wave of altcoins with exponential upside. While BTC dominates the headlines, the real growth potential often lies in low-to-mid-cap projects with room to outperform as capital rotates outward. This summer, MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Cardano are emerging as top setups for outsized gains as institutional inflows rise and market sentiment strengthens. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Becoming the #1 Choice in 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly gaining recognition as a highly asymmetric early-stage opportunity. Still trading under $0.07, the project has raised over $8 million, with Stage 8 now live and buy activity surging. MAGA’s $0.007 listing target and scarcity-driven tokenomics have analysts calling for 34x–40x returns—and some models point to even more extreme upside if current momentum continues. What sets MAGA apart is not just its viral political narrative, but its transparent tokenomics, Hashex audit, and a presale structure attracting both retail and whale capital. As Stage 8 nears completion, traders are calling this a rare chance to secure early exposure before MAGACOIN FINANCE hits exchanges. In a market searching for the next SHIBA or DOGE, MAGA’s combination of community energy, clear roadmap, and realistic price targets puts it at the top of many watchlists. XRP: Futures Launch and ETF Buzz XRP is trading at $2.36, with analysts watching closely as the CME Futures launch and ETF optimism fuel renewed interest. Legal clarity in the U.S. and growing payment adoption have analysts forecasting a move beyond $5 in the short term, with $15–$30 possible if key catalysts align. While a $100 price remains a stretch, the infrastructure being built by Ethereum, Cardano, and new contenders like MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the real drivers of the next major run. Cardano (ADA): Quiet Accumulation and Summer Breakout Cardano (ADA) is trading around $0.85 as of May 2025, with forecasts calling for a steady climb to $1.05 by July and $1.50 by October. Developers have returned, and on-chain metrics are starting to improve. If ADA delivers on upcoming milestones, it could surprise investors with a strong recovery this summer. Many Cardano stakers are rotating into MAGACOIN FINANCE for higher near-term upside, as ADA’s slow pace gives way to more aggressive early-stage plays. Litecoin and Bitcoin: Steady Anchors, But Seeking Momentum Litecoin (LTC) is trading at $103.77, showing steady accumulation but facing resistance near $105. Bitcoin (BTC) is holding above $103,000, with May price predictions between $110,000–$115,000 as institutional interest remains strong. While both remain core holdings, the biggest near-term upside is shifting toward more nimble early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Conclusion As summer kicks off, the 2025 cycle is creating new lanes for growth. XRP and Cardano bring proven value, but it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that’s introducing the kind of high-reward opportunity this market thrives on. With narrative strength, market traction, and investor interest all converging, MAGACOIN FINANCE could still be the next great crypto success story. The window for entry is closing—and those watching closely know this could be the cycle’s defining moment.

2025-05-22T00:00:17.000Z,"Bitcoin UTXO Profit/Loss Ratio Sits Below Critical Levels – How Long Until BTC Overheats?","Bitcoin is on the verge of entering uncharted territory after briefly tagging the $108,000 level earlier today. The flagship cryptocurrency has surged more than 40% since early April, fueled by rising market optimism and institutional demand. However, price is showing hesitation near the all-time high (ATH), now consolidating around $106,000. This key level is acting as both resistance and a psychological barrier, creating mixed sentiment across the market. While many analysts remain bullish, calling for a breakout that could take Bitcoin into price discovery, others are cautioning against premature euphoria, pointing to the potential for a sharp retrace if momentum stalls. Top analyst Axel Adler shared insights suggesting that every strong price acceleration shifts a significant volume of coins from loss into profit, an event that typically pushes the 30-day simple moving average (SMA) of the UTXO profit-to-loss ratio above 200. That level has historically marked overheated conditions and preceded major corrections. As of now, the metric sits at 99, indicating that the market has not yet entered a phase of overheating. This suggests that Bitcoin still has room to run before sentiment becomes excessive, leaving the door open for further upside—or a critical rejection. Momentum Or Correction? Key Metric Suggests Bitcoin Still Has Room to Run This is a pivotal week for Bitcoin and the entire crypto market, with price action set to determine the direction of the coming weeks. After reaching the $107,000 mark on Sunday, Bitcoin was quickly rejected, retracing more than 4% and settling around $106,000. That fakeout highlighted the market’s fragility near the all-time high (ATH) zone. A clean breakout above $109,000 would confirm the continuation of the powerful bullish trend that began in 2023. But if Bitcoin loses current levels and falls below key demand, it could trigger a deeper correction, shaking bullish conviction. Adler provided key insight into market sentiment by analyzing the UTXO profit-to-loss ratio. Historically, every strong acceleration in price that rapidly shifts coins from loss into profit causes the 30-day simple moving average (SMA) of this metric to spike above 200, signaling overheating and often marking the start of a distribution phase. At present, the SMA sits at 99, well below the warning threshold, indicating no signs of excess yet. Adler points out that while Bitcoin still has room to grow, the “easy fuel” behind recent gains is fading. A much stronger push or more volatile price action will be needed to drive the metric higher. Interestingly, this aligns with a larger pattern—this cycle’s third compression phase. If the analogy holds, this coiled spring may soon release energy powerful enough to send Bitcoin well beyond its ATH, but the risk of rejection remains very real. Technical Analysis: Key Weekly Price Action Bitcoin is trading at $106,394 after reaching a local high of $108,035 earlier today. The chart shows BTC holding above the $103,600 breakout level, now acting as a strong support zone. Price action confirms a bullish structure, with higher highs and higher lows forming over the past few weeks. The 200-day SMA at $93,186 and the 200-day EMA at $88,855 remain well below the current price, reinforcing the strength of the ongoing uptrend. However, price is now consolidating below all-time highs, with clear resistance near the $109,000 level. This area marks a crucial test for bulls. Breaking above it would confirm a move into price discovery and could trigger a wave of momentum buying. On the other hand, failure to push higher may result in a retest of the $103,600 or even the $100,000 psychological level. Volume has remained moderate despite the recent rally, suggesting that a strong breakout will require higher participation. The structure currently resembles a high consolidation zone, often a precursor to a volatile move. Bulls remain in control for now, but any drop below $103,600 would weaken short-term momentum and potentially trigger a broader retracement. All eyes remain on BTC’s behavior around the ATH zone.

2025-05-22T00:00:10.000Z,"Feds Charge Atlanta Man for Allegedly Applying for Over $3,390,000 in Fraudulent Small Business Loans During COVID","US authorities arrested an Atlanta man this week on charges related to his alleged connection to a COVID-19 relief loan application fraud ring. The Department of Justice (DOJ) alleges that Ian Patrick Jackson, 37, conspired with another Atlanta man to recruit at least nine business owners to submit fraudulent Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan applications using fake tax documents. Jackson allegedly told the business owners to falsely claim they each employed 16 individuals and paid monthly wages of $120,000. The DOJ says the owners then wrote falsified payroll checks to people who didn’t work for them and then either kept the money for themselves or paid Jackson via his co-conspirator. Jackson is allegedly connected to 15 fraudulent COVID-19 relief loan applications that inked $3.39 million in proceeds. He’s the 12th person to be charged in connection with an Atlanta-based PPP fraud ring, with the 11 previous defendants having already pled guilty or been convicted at trial. The DOJ says authorities have recovered nearly $1.2 million of the defrauded funds. Jackson also allegedly applied for a separate $237,500 PPP loan using fabricated tax forms and used a forged driver’s license and false revenue statements to fraudulently apply for approximately $100,000 in PPP and Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program loans. The DOJ also says he fraudulently secured another $240,035 PPP loan and $125,000 in EIDL program loans and grants on behalf of another company. Jackson has been charged with conspiracy to commit bank fraud, two counts of bank fraud, two counts of wire fraud and two counts of money laundering. The charges could result in decades in prison.

2025-05-21T23:30:46.000Z,"Bitcoin Shows Elevated Unrealized Profits Without Signs Of Panic Selling – New ATH Soon?","Having surged about 22.5% over the past 30 days, Bitcoin (BTC) has sparked concerns in the crypto market that its rally may be nearing exhaustion, with a potential price correction on the horizon. However, the latest on-chain data reveals that despite elevated unrealized profits, there are still no signs of increased selling pressure for the leading cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Unrealized Profits Remain High But No Panic Selling Yet According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by Bitcoin analyst Crazzyblockk, the cohort of new investors – those who have held BTC for less than one month – is currently sitting on unrealized profits of 6.9%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near ATH, But Long-Term Holders Aren’t Selling – More Upside Ahead? In the same vein, short-term investors – holders who have held Bitcoin for less than six months – are sitting on unrealized profits of 10.7%. These figures highlight that the unrealized profit/loss ratio remains elevated, with unrealized profits far outweighing unrealized losses. Crazzyblockk noted that while historically, a high percentage of unrealized profits across the network tends to precede sharp price corrections, the current setup appears different. They added: Past cycles have shown that extreme profit concentration tends to precede volatility; however, current market structure shows no outsized concentration of risk in one participant group. The relatively narrow spread in unrealized profits between new and short-term holders indicates that profit distribution is balanced. Furthermore, although profit levels are high, loss levels remain compressed, suggesting limited pressure from distressed sellers. The contributor remarked: While macro conditions and volatility risk remain elevated, and a price correction cannot be ruled out, there is no strong behavioral signal suggesting a high willingness to trigger major distribution or selling. Further Upside For BTC? Meanwhile, seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently predicted further upside for Bitcoin. In a post on X, Martinez noted that BTC has undergone another bullish breakout, with the potential to reach a new all-time high (ATH) around $111,500. The current momentum has also drawn in retail investors. According to CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Aleman, wallets holding less than $10,000 worth of BTC are steadily returning to the market – a sign of growing retail participation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Cycle Indicator Hints At Bullish Breakout Ahead, Analyst Says That said, some warning signs may still dampen BTC’s current bullish trajectory. For instance, despite the recent encouraging price action, Bitcoin’s Demand Momentum remains subdued. Similarly, Bitcoin’s “supply scarcity” narrative still lacks meaningful strength, as Aleman recently stressed that despite depleting exchange reserves, BTC is not likely to face genuine supply scarcity in the near term. At press time, BTC trades at $106,528, up 1.8% in the past 24 hours.

SFM price dropped over 5 percent today despite the wider altcoin market following Bitcoin in bullish sentiment. A New York jury convicted Braden John Karony, a former CEO of the SafeMoon (SFM) crypto project, on all crucial charges earlier on Wednesday, May 21. Karony was charged by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) with conspiracy to commit securities fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering. The verdict was a result of a two-week trial that concluded that the ex-Safemoon executives defrauded SFM investors by draining purportedly locked liquidity for their personal gains. The case prosecutor alleged that Karony alongside Thomas Smith, a former Safemoon CTO, and Kyle Nagy, the project’s creator, misappropriated millions of investors’ funds between 2021 and 2022. While Smith has already pleaded guilty to all charges and testified against Karony, Nagy remains a fugitive, allegedly in Russia. Meanwhile, Karony will remain in police custody ahead of his sentencing, with his properties worth over $1.8 million seized. Market Impact on the Safemoon Project The Safemoon project has struggled to regain market share in the recent past following the indictment of the ex-officials. The project dropped in net valuation from nearly $1 billion to about $7.5 million at the time of this writing, according to our latest crypto oracle. Following the announcement on Wednesday, SFM price dropped over 4 percent in the past 24 hours to trade about $0.00002 during the late North American trading session. The Safemoon project has recorded sustained bearish sentiment in the recent past despite the wider altcoin market attempting to follow Bitcoin price in bullish sentiment. Furthermore, BTC price rallied over 4 percent in the past 24 hours to trade at about $109k, while the BNB and Dogecoin led in the wider altcoin recovery.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/new-york-jury-convicts-ex-safemoon-sfm-executive-on-all-charges/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","News",cryptocompare

Bitcoin, XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE Are Leading the New Cycle’s Charge","May 2025 is seeing a decisive shift in capital as whales and smart money accumulate select tokens. Bitcoin, XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are leading this trend, with on-chain data and analyst commentary confirming high-conviction buying. HBAR and Ethereum remain relevant, but the most notable accumulation is now concentrated in projects with clear upside and imminent catalysts. Bitcoin: Whales Quietly Accumulate Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $103,405, with whale addresses accumulating over 83,000 BTC between mid-April and mid-May 2025. Institutional confidence is rising as retail investors take profits, and forecasts for May call for an average BTC price of $119,798, with potential highs of $136,239 by month’s end. As Bitcoin’s momentum steadies above $100,000, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are drawing increased attention from growth-focused investors looking for the next major wave of upside. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF MAGACOIN FINANCE: Whale Activity and Early-Stage Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE has seen a surge in whale accumulation as its presale advances, with over $8 million raised and the price still under $0.001. The project’s scarcity-driven model—a capped 100 billion token supply, 45% allocated to presale, and Hashex-audited contracts—has made it one of the most dominant presales of 2025. Analysts forecast 25x–35x returns, with some models pointing to even higher upside if current momentum continues. Whale allocations and rapid presale sellouts highlight strong conviction, positioning MAGACOIN FINANCE as a top altcoin breakout for Q2 and Q3 2025.

The VanEck PurposeBuilt Fund, available only to accredited investors, aims to invest in liquid tokens and venture-backed projects across Web3 sectors, including gaming, financial services, payments, and artificial intelligence. Idle capital will be deployed into Avalanche ( AVAX ) real-world asset (RWA) products, including tokenized money market funds, VanEck said. The fund will be managed by the team behind VanEck’s Digital Assets Alpha Fund (DAAF), which oversees more than $100 million in net assets as of May 21. “The next wave of value in crypto will come from real businesses, not more infrastructure,” Pranav Kanade, portfolio manager for DAAF, said in a statement.

In April, VanEck launched another ETF investing in a passive index of companies operating in the crypto space. Asset managers such as VanEck are requesting the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) permission to list upward of 70 crypto ETFs.

2025-05-21T22:26:44.000Z,"Ethereum Price Prediction: Bull Flag Points to $3,600 – But This One Indicator Could Push It to $5K","Ethereum (ETH) has gone up by nearly 1% in the past 24 hours and currently stands at $2,535 after a few days of relatively muted price action. The token’s post-Pectra rally encountered some selling pressure at the $2,750 level upon crossing the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) in the daily chart. Crypto trader Merlijn the Trader hinted at a bullish Ethereum price prediction on X as he spotted a ‘golden cross’ in the 12-hour chart. This is a bullish indicator that has recently produced strong gains in the near term for the top altcoin. The last Golden Cross sent $ETH flying. Now it’s flashing the same setup again. Ethereum to $3,000 is on the table. Ignore it at your own risk. pic.twitter.com/mHsrveBQiJ — Merlijn The Trader (@MerlijnTrader) May 20, 2025 Ethereum price forecasts have been revamped lately after the successful implementation of the network’s Pectra upgrade. This widely awaited revamp to the blockchain’s design has improved its efficiency and could make ETH a deflationary token as a portion of gas fees will now be burned to reduce its circulating supply. Ethereum Price Prediction: Bull Flag Breakout Could Result in 45% Gain for ETH Meanwhile, another continuation pattern has emerged in the past few days that could anticipate a bullish breakout that pushes ETH to at least $3,600. Flat patterns are known as high-probability technical setups that occur after the price has experienced a strong bullish or bearish movement. It indicates that the market is taking a pause to consolidate before resuming the previous move. In the case of ETH, this flag pattern has emerged after a robust uptrend that propelled the price from $1,800 to its current levels. If a bullish breakout occurs, which in this case means that the price breaks above the upper bound of the flag at $2,600, the expected price movement is often estimated using the size of the flag’s pole as a reference. For ETH, this means an upside potential of at least 45% that would take its price to $3,600 in the next few weeks. The pattern’s bullish bias would be confirmed if the breakout occurs in combination with high trading volumes. In addition, ETH could be about to deliver another strong buy signal as the 21-day EMA is nearing the 200-day EMA. If the former crosses above the latter, a bullish signal known as a ‘golden cross’ will be triggered and this could result in major gains for the token in a relatively short period as well. Like ETH, Bitcoin (BTC) has rallied above the $100,000 mark already. A new crypto presale called BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) is gearing up to automatically deliver rewards to token holders once the price hits $125,000. BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) Allows Bitcoin Investors to Generate Passive Income BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) delivers different types of rewards to token holders as Bitcoin hits new price milestones. Now that BTC has surpassed the $100,000 mark, the first of these milestones is closer than ever. The system is quite simple. For every $25,000 that BTC adds to its price, either a portion of BTCBULL’s circulating supply will be burned or token holders will receive a direct airdrop of Bitcoin tokens. With $6 million raised since the presale event was launched, the rewards pool has been fully funded to cover the first couple of milestone-based rewards. To buy $BTCBULL and start earning passive income from Bitcoin’s rally, head to the BTC Bull Token website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH or use a bank card to invest.

2025-05-21T22:23:15.000Z,"Here’s 5 Key Reasons Why BlackRock Isn’t Filing For XRP ETF Now!","The post Here’s 5 Key Reasons Why BlackRock Isn’t Filing For XRP ETF Now! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with AUM of $11.6 trillion, has been leading the charge with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, but when it comes to XRP, they seem to be in no rush. Despite growing interest and the recent launch of institutional futures, BlackRock hasn’t filed for an XRP ETF. So what’s holding them back? Let’s break it down. 1. Regulations Still Unclear The biggest reason is regulatory uncertainty. Even though a U.S. court ruled that XRP isn’t a security when traded on exchanges, the SEC hasn’t fully accepted this. In fact, ETF decisions continue to be pushed further, some now expected in June or even October 2025. BlackRock is known for playing it safe, they won’t file for an XRP ETF until regulators draw a clear line between securities and commodities in crypto. As one X user smartly pointed out, clarity might only come once major legislation, like the Stablecoin Act, is passed. 2. Derivatives Market Still Growing For big institutions, futures markets are a key tool for managing risk. While Bitcoin and Ethereum have mature futures markets with massive volume, XRP only just launched CME futures on May 19, 2025, with $19 million in first-day volume. That’s a strong start, but not enough yet. BlackRock and others want to see more consistent trading volume over time. 3. Liquidity Still Needs to Grow XRP has strong market depth, but for an ETF to function smoothly, it needs stable liquidity that can handle billions in inflows and outflows. Until XRP hits that level of maturity, ETF approval remains unlikely. 4. Focus on Winning Plays BlackRock is currently focused on its Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs , which are performing well. Rather than spreading its efforts thin, it’s doubling down on what’s working. 5. Strategic Timing Is Everything Finally, it could all come down to timing. With XRP and Solana leading ETF application discussions, BlackRock might be waiting to see how the SEC handles current filings before joining the race. It’s a waiting game for more demand, stronger liquidity, and a green light from regulators. So, while XRP fans might be eager, BlackRock is playing the long game.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/heres-5-key-reasons-why-blackrock-isnt-filing-for-xrp-etf-now/,"BTC|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP","News",cryptocompare

2025-05-21T22:09:18.000Z,"SEC Acknowledges the Amendment Proposal For BlackRock Ethereum ETF","The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has finally acknowledged an amendment in the spot Ethereum Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) filing submitted by BlackRock, a leading asset management firm. This marks a significant milestone for the firm and the broader cryptocurrency sector. In-cash Redemption Over In-kind Method For SEC ETF Approval BlackRock is not trying to submit a new spot ETH ETF application to the Commission. Rather, it is seeking to adjust the fund’s creation and redemption methods, which were launched in 2024. At inception, the BlackRock iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) was designed to accommodate in-kind redemption, but after going through the SEC’s desk, the firm was forced to choose the in-cash method instead. At the time, it did not look like BlackRock would have a chance of approval for the ETF if it did not make the suggested adjustments. One year after ETHA launched , precisely on May 10, it boldly filed for an amendment of the spot Ethereum ETF to allow an in-kind creation and redemption process. This coincides with the period when they discussed having Anchorage Digital as an additional Ethereum custodian . Benefits on In-kind Creation and Redemption of Ethereum ETF An in-kind approach allows authorized investors to exchange ETH for ETF shares during creation and redemption. These entities also get the exclusive advantage of sidestepping capital gains tax since they will not need to sell their ETH for cash. Cboe once proposed in-kind redemption for ARK 21Shares Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. In-kind creation and redemption in the Ethereum ETF have the potential to improve ETH price tracking while reducing trading fees. According to the document filed for the amendment, “This post-effective amendment No 1 to Form S-1 is being filed by the registrant to disclose that the Trust may allow for an in-kind creation and redemption process as an alternative to the Trust’s current cash creation and redemption process.” What Next? The US SEC has now opened the BlackRock ETHA amendment proposal filing for public comments. The agency usually takes this action before deciding on an application. The latest move from the SEC generally suggests that the regulator is actively working on the filing, although this does not guarantee that an approval will end the process.

2025-05-21T22:01:28.000Z,"Mike Novogratz Says Weakening Dollar, Widening Deficit and America’s Deteriorating Financial Situation ‘Very Good’ for Bitcoin and Crypto","The chief executive of crypto asset manager Galaxy Digital says America’s current financial situation is bullish for Bitcoin ( BTC ) and crypto. In a new interview with Bloomberg, Novogratz says that many factors have contributed to the rise of digital assets, including President Donald Trump and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s embrace of the sector. “It started with Larry Fink. When he got orange-pilled, the largest asset manager in the world said ‘this is a real asset,’ at least Bitcoin, that everyone should be a part of and lots of other companies… followed suit. And that was kind of round one of institutions coming in. But really it was the shift of approach from the Gary Gensler SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) to this Trump Administration which has just embraced our industry, and that freed up the animal spirit, both here and abroad.” However, Novogratz goes on to say that America’s current uncertain fiscal situation is ultimately good for the top crypto asset by market cap and the digital assets industry in general. He says the Trump administration’s failure to significantly lower the debt-to-GDP ratio has been a boon for the asset class. “We’re in a really hard position as a country… We have this kind of debt, yield curves are selling off everywhere, the dollar is under pressure, and that all is very good for Bitcoin and crypto assets as well.” BTC is trading for $108,961 at time of writing, just below a new all-time high.

2025-05-21T22:00:35.000Z,"The XRP Rebound Blueprint: Double Bottom Could Fuel A Run To $2.80 Resistance","In a recent update on X, market analyst CRYPTOWZRD highlighted a developing double bottom formation on the XRPBTC chart, suggesting a possible bullish reversal may be underway. Although XRP ended the previous session with indecisive movements, this emerging pattern could drive its price action higher. Should the reversal confirm, XRP is likely to push toward the $2.80 resistance zone. Bitcoin Dominance Pressures Altcoins, XRP Included Expanding on his initial analysis, the analyst noted that XRP and XRPBTC closed their daily candles indecisively, reflecting ongoing market uncertainty and a lack of strong directional action. While XRPBTC is currently holding above a key double bottom formation, the analyst emphasized that the pair still appears relatively weak and requires more stable and constructive price action to confirm a bullish breakout. A strong reaction from this level could serve as a catalyst, helping XRP gain momentum from its current position on the chart. Related Reading: XRP Price Will Still Rally From Here, Crypto Veteran Raoul Pal Forecasts He also pointed out that Bitcoin dominance continues to exert pressure on altcoins, including XRP, causing them to underperform in their BTC pairs. As Bitcoin dominance approaches a major resistance level, the analyst anticipates a reversal that could shift capital flow back into altcoins. Such a reversal would provide a favorable environment and support a broader bullish continuation for XRP. Looking ahead, the analyst stated that his focus will remain on the lower time frames throughout the next trading session to determine the next scalp opportunity, particularly if XRPBTC begins to show signs of recovery and buyers step in with stronger momentum. Waiting On Confirmation: No Entry Without A Clear Move Concluding his analysis, the analyst provided his outlook for the near-term price action, noting that intraday trading was choppy and lacked clear direction throughout the session. Despite the indecisiveness, he predicts a potential upside continuation if the price breaks above the $2.4650 intraday resistance level. Related Reading: Massive XRP Selling Pressure Is Stalling Price Action, Analyst Warns Conversely, he identified $2.3160 as a crucial intraday support level, where buyers may step in if the market pulls back. This zone will be important to watch, as a breakdown below it could delay any immediate bullish momentum and signal further consolidation. The price action between these two levels will likely define the short-term direction for XRP. He emphasized that patience is key at this stage, urging traders to wait for a clear and healthy move before considering new entries. With market conditions still uncertain, the analyst plans to stay focused on refined setups and mature formations to ensure higher-probability trades in the sessions ahead.

The stock is currently trading at a yearly high of 933 JPY. However, Metaplanet stock has become the most shorted, with many analysts comparing it to the euphoric GME short of 2021. According to BitconTreasuries, an estimated 1,082,164 BTC ($110.8 billion) is currently held by publicly listed and private corporate treasuries, reaching a new all-time high of 5.5% of the current circulating supply. That’s four times more bitcoins on corporate balance sheets than three years ago, with Metaplanet amassing over 700% more coins across the same period, today reaching 7800 BTC($800 million). Metaplanet stock gains 57% in a week Today, the Japanese firm made the most significant single Bitcoin acquisition, purchasing 1004 BTC. The purchase has already triggered BTC’s price to reach a new all-time high of $109,500, among other factors, with the firm’s stock rallying by 57% over the last week. The latest purchase follows the May 7th purchase of 555 BTC. Analysts describe the Japanese firm as a “serial Bitcoin buyer,” following the footsteps of Microstrategy and BlackRock. Metaplanet is going parabolic right now Bitcoin Treasury Cycle pic.twitter.com/70yHX0lobS — Thomas Fahrer (@thomas_fahrer) May 21, 2025 Bought at an average price of $94.4k, when BTC finally broke out of its $100k resistance, a significant parabolic increase has been witnessed on Metaplanet’s stock, and is expected for bitcoin again by traders. The purchase pushed the price upward of $105k momentarily before correcting on the intraday chart. With good Q1 results and aggressive bitcoin purchases , the Japanese firm’s stock price has seen huge trading volumes on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and other global indexes. The company’s Bitcoin Strategist, Dylan Leclair, revealed on May 20 that 2.51 million shares of the company’s DN3 stock in Germany were traded, with a total transaction value of 15.35 million euros. $MTPLF recorded 21.14 million stocks traded, amounting to $150.29 million in value. Investor sentiments believe the institutional buy would likely trigger FOMO, attracting more investors looking to join the wave. Metaplanet becomes the most-shorted stock in Japan Japan’s equity data revealed that Metaplanet is the country’s most shorted stock by hedge funds. “Apparently, Metaplanet is the most shorted stock in Japan. Do they think betting against Bitcoin is a winning strategy?” – Simon Gerovich Metaplanet CEO Crypto experts and analysts believe that despite this massive rally, the company’s stock is relatively cheap. BlockStream CEO Adam Back argued that, in his opinion, Metaplanet is relatively inexpensive based on the historic mNAV ranges. He added that the Japanese firm is expanding 3.8 times faster than the US-based Microstrategy when measured by market net asset value mNAV coverage. However, he still believes that shorting is a bad idea since the latest rally is the second 3350:TYO circuit breaker limit-up day in a row, which is a very bad time to short, according to him. Bitcoin maverick Michael Saylor reinforced Back’s idea, noting that if $MTPLF is any indication, 3350 will hit limit-up again the next day. Adam Livingstone , a Bitcoin analyst, says the Japanese stock is not very big and, as such, lacks enough liquidity to exit in case of a squeeze. Metaplanet is currently heavily invested in BTC ; therefore, its stock is highly correlated to the bitcoin price. Short sellers betting the stock will fall are under pressure as the stock price continues to hit upper limits, and trading halts were triggered for two days on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE). The temporary halt has restricted short sellers, who have now turned to OTC trading in the international markets to cover their positions.

The government has just launched the Pakistan Digital Assets Authority (PDAA), a new body that will manage and regulate Bitcoin and other digital assets across the country. This move comes at a time when Pakistan’s unofficial crypto market is estimated to be worth around $25 billion. Pakistan Launches PDAA To Regulate Digital Assets On Wednesday, Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance announced the official launch of the PDAA, a dedicated body to regulate all things related to digital assets. This includes Bitcoin, stablecoins, tokenized assets, wallets, and even decentralized finance (DeFi) tools. According to the Ministry of Finance, the PDAA will help build a secure, investor-friendly environment and make Pakistan more attractive to global blockchain firms. Meanwhile, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the PDAA is not just about regulation. It’s also about creating a strong, forward-thinking system that invites foreign investment, protects users, and encourages Web3 innovation. What Will the PDAA Do? Here are some key responsibilities the PDAA will take on: Oversee Pakistan’s massive $25B crypto market Promote Bitcoin mining using extra, unused energy Allow the tokenization of government-owned assets and public debt Provide legal ways for investors, both inside and outside Pakistan Help grow Web3 startups and digital exports Global Crypto Partnerships Underway Another eye-catching move was Pakistan’s recent deal with World Liberty Financial (WLF), a crypto company backed by the Trump family. It recently signed a deal with World Liberty Financial (WLF), a crypto company linked to the Trump family. The deal was made through the Pakistan Crypto Council, which also brought on Binance founder CZ as an adviser. These partnerships hint at Pakistan’s larger plan to become a serious player in the global crypto space. New Financial Identity for Pakistan? With this new framework, Pakistan joins countries like Singapore, Japan, and the UAE, which have already made space for blockchain innovation. The PDAA will operate under FATF-compliant rules to ensure international trust. Experts believe this could be the beginning of a major shift.

2025-05-21T21:58:18.000Z,"Here’s what happened in crypto today","Today in crypto, the Texas House passed SB 21 to create a state-run Bitcoin reserve; DWF Labs’ Andrei Grachev said the GENIUS Act could legitimize stablecoins for institutions; and the SEC filed a $100M fraud suit against Unicoin and its executives. Texas House passes strategic Bitcoin reserve bill The Texas House of Representatives has passed the third reading of SB 21 , a bill that seeks to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the state. The bill passed in a 101-42 vote and will now go to Texas Governor Greg Abbott to either sign into law or veto. SB 21, authored by state Senator Charles Schwertner, establishes a Bitcoin (BTC) reserve that is managed by the state’s comptroller. The legislation allows the comptroller to invest in any cryptocurrency with a market cap above $500 billion over the previous 12-month period. Currently, the only cryptocurrency fitting the requirement is Bitcoin. Before the vote, state Representative Giovanni Capriglione said to the chamber that the bill was a “pivotal moment in securing Texas’s leadership in the digital age with the passage of our strategic Bitcoin reserve. Now, we embrace a modern asset with traditional properties for future promise.” The bill passed in the Texas Senate in a 25-5 vote on March 6. Texas State Representative Giovanni Capriglione presenting SB 21. Source: Bitcoin Laws Texas’s economy is the second-largest in the United States, with a gross domestic product of $2.7 trillion in 2024, according to KVUE. If Texas were its own country, it would have the eighth-largest economy in the world. If Abbott signs SB 21 into law, Texas will be the second US state to allow for the creation of a cryptocurrency reserve. New Hampshire became the first to do so on May 6 after Governor Kelly Ayotte signed House Bill 302 into law . GENIUS Act “legitimizes” stablecoins for global institutional adoption Stablecoin adoption among institutions could surge as the United States Senate prepares to debate a key piece of legislation aimed at regulating the sector. After failing to gain support from key Democrats on May 8, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act passed the US Senate in a 66–32 procedural vote on May 20 and is now heading to a debate on the Senate floor. The bill seeks to set clear rules for stablecoin collateralization and mandate compliance with Anti-Money Laundering laws. “This act doesn’t just regulate stablecoins, it legitimizes them,” said Andrei Grachev, managing partner at DWF Labs and Falcon Finance. “It sets clear rules, and with clarity comes confidence. That’s what institutions have been waiting for,” Grachev told Cointelegraph during the Chain Reaction daily X spaces show on May 20, adding: “Stablecoins aren’t a crypto experiment anymore.

On-chain data shows a supply shock has catalyzed Bitcoin’s bullish sentiment. After the Texas Senate approved the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SB21) bill earlier in March 2025, the House passed it with a final vote of 101 to 42. Texas is now the third state in the country to pass an SBR bill in both the Senate and the House after New Hampshire and Arizona in the recent past. The SB21 bill in Texas has to be vetted again by the Senate after the House amendment changed some statutory provisions regarding the market cap of crypto assets. Notably, the Texas House changed the market cap average of $500 billion from 12 months to 24 months. According to Dennis Porter, the CEO and co-founder of Satoshi Action Fund, there is a 99+ percent chance that the Texas Senate will approve the amendment to SB21. Meanwhile, the SB21 bill will soon be forwarded to the State Governor, Greg Abbott, who will have 20 days to either sign or veto the bill. Technically the Texas bill has to go back to the senate to confirm the amendment which passed in the House. The House amendment changed the market cap average of $500 billion from 12 months to 24 months. I’ve been told the odds of it being approved by the Senate at 99%+. https://t.co/PJsrfGdVbZ — Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) May 21, 2025 Impact of Texas SBR Bill Approval on Bitcoin Currently, BTC is the only cryptocurrency to meet the set standards by the Texas SB21 bill.

Moreover, the adoption of Bitcoin by U.S. states will solidify it as a reliable digital gold amid economic turmoil.

2025-05-21T21:17:53.000Z,"Altcoin ETFs Won’t Create ‘Material Demand from Institutional Investors’ – Analyst","Bitcoin’s rally in May has led to improved sentiment in the crypto space, despite persisting macroeconomic concerns stemming from US President Donald Trump’s aggressive tariff policy. However, although Bitcoin briefly set a new all-time high on 21 May, most altcoins are still considerably down and look unlikely to retest their all-time highs in the near-term. Altcoins have historically outperformed Bitcoin during sharp rallies and risk-on periods, but Suliman Mulhem, a financial analyst, has cautioned that BTC is set to deliver superior returns this cycle despite altcoin ETFs being on the horizon. “Although some altcoins, such as Ether, have outperformed Bitcoin on its recent leg up since the start of May, it’s almost certain that BTC will deliver a higher return – certainly on a risk-adjusted basis – than the vast majority of alts on longer time frames,” Mulhem said. “This is primarily because Bitcoin’s rally from around $45,000 at the start of 2024 to over $106,000 as of mid-May 2025 has been driven almost entirely by strong demand from corporations that have adopted a BTC accumulation programme, such as Strategy and Metaplanet, and institutional investors who have been scaling their exposure to Bitcoin via ETFs.” Continuing, Mulhem explained that corporations and ETFs are set to continue to dominate the market, and argued that even if additional altcoin ETFs and ETPs are approved by the SEC, this will not translate into significant new demand for altcoins. “Corporations and institutional investors are poised to indefinitely remain the largest net buyers of Bitcoin, perhaps only being rivalled eventually by governments and central banks who opt to create their own strategic BTC reserves,” he said. “While there are dozens of spot ETFs and other exchange-traded products (ETPs) for altcoins pending approval in the US, they are likely to only attract meagre inflows even if the SEC green-lights them.” Highlighting why ETFs won’t create significant new demand for altcoins, Mulhem argued that altcoins don’t have a place in institutional investors’ portfolios. “This is because all altcoins lack a clearly defined value proposition for institutional investors, corporations and governments. “This contrasts with Bitcoin, which is already being viewed as ‘digital gold’ mainly due to its limited supply and perceived value as a hedge against fiat currency debasement and sovereign debt risk, while also delivering huge upside during ‘risk-on’ periods. “Therefore, although the widespread approval of new ETFs and ETPs will provide institutional investors with access to altcoins, we shouldn’t expect these new funds to directly create material new demand, and they are unlikely to be a significant source of buying pressure for the foreseeable future. “As such, altcoins are set to remain almost entirely reliant on retail investors, whose participation levels are yet to return to the peak levels we saw during the 2021 bull run.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

With this new surge, Bitcoin has now overtaken Amazon in market value and is the fifth-largest asset in the world with a market cap of $2.14 trillion. But many experts say this is just the beginning. So, what’s pushing Bitcoin higher this time? Institution Pouring Huge Capital One of the biggest reasons behind Bitcoin’s rise is the growing interest from big institutions. MicroStrategy, now rebranded as Strategy, has added more BTC to its already massive stack, now holding over 576,000 Bitcoins, which is 2.7% of the total supply. That’s no small move. Other companies are following their lead. Japan’s Metaplanet just bought 1,004 BTC, bringing its total holdings to 10,000 BTC. This growing corporate demand is one reason why many believe Bitcoin still has room to fly. Politics and Policy Are Turning Pro-Bitcoin It’s not just companies that are getting involved—governments are stepping in too. In the U.S., the GENIUS Act , which supports clearer stablecoin regulations, is moving forward in the U.S. Senate. On top of that, President Donald Trump’s executive order to build a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, and you’ve got real government-level support fueling investor confidence. All this has added fuel to the fire. With all this support, Bitcoin’s market value has now reached $2.13 trillion, making it the fifth most valuable asset behind gold, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Apple. Where Is Bitcoin Heading Next? Looking at the recent Bitcoin rise, Veteran trader Peter Brandt believes this is just another step in a bigger rally. He thinks Bitcoin could reach $150,000 by August. He’s currently “long” on BTC, meaning he expects it to go higher. Famous author Robert Kiyosaki also sees big things ahead, he says Bitcoin might even hit $250,000 this year. So, while Bitcoin is already at a new high, many believe the real breakout is still ahead",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-hits-new-all-time-high-price-109800-veteran-trader-says-bull-run-begins/,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","News",cryptocompare
2025-05-21T21:07:52.000Z,"Bitcoin Reaches ATH, Becomes 5th Largest Asset in the World","Bitcoin (BTC) has reached a new milestone. For the second time this year, the world-leading cryptocurrency has hit an all-time high (ATH) of $109,487. This price jump has also helped Bitcoin overtake Amazon in value, making it the fifth most valuable asset in the world. Bitcoin Now More Valuable Than Amazon With its latest price jump, Bitcoin’s total market value has climbed to over $2.13 trillion, putting it just behind gold, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Apple. This achievement shows how much Bitcoin has grown over the years, from being seen as a risky bet to becoming one of the top financial assets in the world. According to CoinMarketCap , Bitcoin rose from a daily low of about $105,135 before hitting its new high. The steady price rise suggests that the flagship cryptocurrency may continue to grow. Experts Say Bitcoin Could Climb Higher Well-known trader Peter Brandt, who has followed Bitcoin for a long time, says the digital asset could rise even further. In a recent X post, he reiterated that this bull run is far from over. He even predicts that the digital asset might reach between $125,000 and $150,000 by the end of August. Another analyst, known as the Titan of Crypto, is also confident. He said the target of 135,000 in 2025 is still on track and unfolding just as expected. Meanwhile, other industry leaders have shared a bullish long-term goal regarding Bitcoin’s future. In March, Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest, shared her bullish outlook for BTC. She said the digital coin could hit $1 million before 2030, as projected. Institutional Investors Are Driving the BTC Rally Bitcoin’s rise is not just coming from retail investors. Big companies and investment firms are also adding to the growth. BlackRock, one of the world’s largest investment firms, has a Bitcoin fund called IBIT. This fund now owns over 636,000 Bitcoins, showing that large investors are interested in the flagship crypto. Not only that, but public companies are also buying a lot of Bitcoin. Nasdaq-listed firm Strategy, led by Michael Saylor, now holds the biggest Bitcoin stash of any other public company. This shows that more businesses are starting to believe in Bitcoin’s future. The company’s unrealized profit is $22.7 billion. Other firms, such as Japan’s Metaplanet and Basel Medical Group, are also adding Bitcoin to their reserves. Following Bitcoin’s recent all-time high, Saylor said on social media that Bitcoin is still the best thing to buy, especially since cash and property come with more risks now. This comes at a tough time for Strategy. The Bitcoin-focused firm is facing a class action lawsuit from investors. The plaintiffs recently accused the firm of making false and misleading statements about its profits and the risks associated with its BTC strategy.

The analyst cited historically reliable top indicators that suggest that the market has not reached its top yet, even as parabolic signals fail to trigger a surge. No Sign Of A Bitcoin Cycle Top — Yet In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), market expert Crypto Con shared a comprehensive technical analysis rooted in the well-regarded top Bitcoin cycle indicators developed by DA_Prof. The accompanying chart revealed that Bitcoin’s current market trajectory has yet to reach the “cycle top” zone — a region that has consistently coincided with major market peaks in the past. Related Reading: Road To $320,000: Bitcoin Enters Trend Continuation, But $109,400 Must Hold Da Prof’s technical indicator model synthesizes insights from thirteen time-tested on-chain and market metrics. This multifactor approach has successfully predicted past cycle tops in 2013, 2017, and 2021, making it a valuable tool in potentially identifying long-term market turning points. According to Crypto Con, Bitcoin’s current price action and technical readings suggest that the flagship cryptocurrency may still be preparing for a final ATH rally. The analyst asserts that any potential cycle peak in 2025 will likely emerge only when Bitcoin enters a critical zone identified through the convergence of these thirteen advanced indicators. The metrics utilized in Da Prof’s indicator model include: Coin Value Days Destroyed (CVDD) Extension Net Unrealized Profit-Loss (NUPL) Market Value-Realized Value Z-score (MVRVZ) Calendar Seasonality (CSI: top near November 21) Puell Multiple (PUELL) Halving Seasonality (HSI: top near 538 days after halving event) Logue PolyLog Regression (PLR) Realized Price (RP) Extension Plus Directional Movement (PDM) Logarithmic MACD (LMACD) Pi Cycle Top (PCT) Transaction Fee Spike (TFS) Risk Crypto Con noted that historically, when these indicators converged in the red-hot region, represented by the cluster of indicators in the lower heatmap section of the chart, the Bitcoin price experienced a dramatic peak followed by a significant crash. However, in the current cycle, none of Da Prof’s metrics have entered the zone. Instead, the readings across the lower bands of the model remain comparatively muted, suggesting that market euphoria has not yet reached past-cycle extremes. Parabola Signals Flash Early, But No Peak In Sight While Da Prof’s top Bitcoin indicators remain elusive, Parabola signals, another key feature of Crypto Con’s analysis, have flashed not once but three times in this cycle. These signals are historically linked with the early stages of Bitcoin’s explosive price rallies experienced during the previous bull markets.

Bipartisan support indicates stablecoins as a U.S. policy priority, easing regulatory uncertainty. Ethereum and Solana may surge as regulated stablecoins drive institutional DeFi adoption. The U.S. Senate ignited crypto’s future on May 19, as they voted 66-32 to pass the GENIUS Act —a bipartisan stablecoin bill hailed by Bitwise’s Matt Hougan as the potential catalyst for a “multi-year crypto bull market.” The legislation, which earned rare cross-party support, now moves to final amendments and a decisive vote. The Senate voted 66-32 to advance the GENIUS Act, which would regulate stablecoins for the first time at the federal level. A total of 16 Democrats voted to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed, a critical first step. A final passage vote isn't likely until after Memorial Day — Brendan Pedersen (@BrendanPedersen) May 20, 2025 Can the GENIUS Act Spark a $2.5T Stablecoin Surge? Hougan likened the bill’s importance to “Wall Street and crypto getting married,” arguing it represents the most consequential regulatory milestone since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. The Bitwise CIO added in a newsletter statement “the stage for a long term sustained rally in crypto assets beyond Bitcoin, is set”, naming Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and DeFi tokens like Uniswap (UNI) and Aave (AAVE) as potential top beneficiaries. The GENIUS Act mandates stablecoin issuers to fully back tokens with the U.S. Treasury or dollar equivalents, enforcing anti-money-laundering rules, and registering with federal regulators. Stablecoin issuers exceeding $50 billion in market cap must undergo annual audits. Additionally, foreign stablecoin operators will face stringent oversight to “ensure U.S. dollar dominance,” according to Republican Senator Bill Hagerty, a key architect of the bill. Hougan predicts the legislation will legitimize the use of stablecoins in mainstream finance and transform the $236 billion stablecoin market into a $2.5 trillion sector. Critics, including Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, warned the bill could allow a de facto central bank digital currency and overlook conflicts of interest, noting President Donald Trump’s ties to the USD1 stablecoin issuer. However, Hougan argues that the bill’s true impact lies in normalizing blockchain-based transactions, paving the way for trillions in stocks, bonds, and assets to migrate to crypto networks. “Once dollars move seamlessly on-chain, other financial instruments will follow,” Hougan said. “This is the thesis for Ethereum and Solana, and it’s just the beginning.” “Imagine JPMorgan issuing stablecoins, Amazon offering discounts for crypto payments, and stablecoins becoming as common as Venmo,” the Bitwise CIO explained further in his address. If finalized, the GENIUS Act could take effect by summer, marking the first comprehensive federal crypto law in U.S. history. Why Did 16 Democrats Flip on Crypto Regulation? U.S. Senators initially voted 49-48 to reject the revised GENIUS Act. The bill, which was backed by Republican Senators Bill Hagerty, Cynthia Lummis, Tim Scott, and John Thune, has been in the works for months, building anticipation as lawmakers sought a clear regulatory path for digital assets. Despite early support from both sides of the Senate, momentum fell as national security concerns and heavy criticism of the bill were voiced by Democrats. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent criticized the outcome as a missed opportunity to reinforce U.S. dollar dominance, while Senator Lummis called the rejection a “step backward” for crypto innovation. Nonetheless, swift pressure from lawmakers and crypto founders who supported the bill spurred a second vote.

These discussions helped shape the latest variation and could still influence future reform of stablecoin legislation. Is Bitcoin’s $200K Target Tied to Stablecoin Growth? In late March, Bitwise CIO Matthew Hougan predicted that Bitcoin could break through the $200,000 psychological level before the end of 2025, driven by key shifts such as accelerating adoption by institutions and governments. Hougan emphasized that earlier rallies lacked government participation, a huge difference this time due to the inclusion of sovereign wealth. “The final barrier fell when governments became holders,” he stated. “Bitcoin’s survival was no longer in doubt; growth became the focus.” His forecast echoes similar 2024 bold predictions from other industry experts about the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Over 70 corporations, including Tesla and MicroStrategy, have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, while Wall Street titans like BlackRock and Fidelity have also entered the crypto arena. Though Hougan admitted that regulatory ambiguities and market volatility are short-term risks, he dismissed them as temporary hurdles, stressing Bitcoin’s evolution into an institutional mainstay. Reinforcing his outlook during a panel session, the Bitwise CIO added, “95% of all Bitcoin is already owned, and 95% of investable money doesn’t own any Bitcoin.” BULLISH: Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan says, \""95% of all Bitcoin is already owned and 95% of investable money doesn't own any Bitcoin.\"" HIGHER pic.twitter.com/QfKDPmYXtP — CryptosRus (@CryptosR_Us) May 15, 2025 He argued that substantial price increases are inevitable with $30 trillion in investable capital targeting a limited supply of Bitcoin. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Will the GENIUS Act push China to accelerate its Digital Currency? By enforcing U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins, the GENIUS Act could pressure nations like China or the EU to fast-track their own digital currency systems to avoid dollar dominance. Could DeFi platforms lose decentralization under new stablecoin regulations? Regulated stablecoins may drive institutional capital into DeFi, but compliance demands could force platforms to censor transactions or adopt KYC rules, clashing with decentralization ideals. How will Bitcoin purists react to regulated stablecoins? Bitcoin maximalists will likely reject regulated stablecoins as centralized intrusions, doubling down on BTC’s decentralized purity. However, some may pragmatically use them for trading while maintaining ideological opposition to their adoption.

Special leave is required in an appeal to the High Court, and it’s only granted in cases where it would answer significant legal questions or matters of public interest.A Block Earner spokesperson told Cointelegraph the matter has now escalated to a “broader legal question” around the definition of a financial product, which extends “well beyond Block Earner, and the crypto sector.” “We believe the Full Federal Court’s April ruling was a strong and well-reasoned decision that upheld the integrity of our operations,” the spokesperson said. “We remain confident in the soundness of that judgment and will respond to ASIC’s application through the appropriate legal channels.” Legal saga ongoing since 2022ASIC first launched legal proceedings against Block Earner in November 2022, arguing the company needed a financial services license to offer its yield product which was available from March 17, 2022, until the company shut it down on Nov. 16, 2022.Related: Australia outlines crypto regulation plan, promises action on debankingASIC was arguing Block Earner needed a financial services license to offer its crypto-linked fixed-yield earning product.

The steps include a new, trustless architecture, a native token, and the Seeker ship date.According to the announcement, Solana Mobile will ship the device starting Aug. 4. Seeker is the company’s second-generation device, after the Saga Web3 phone that launched in April 2023. The company unveiled the Seeker phone in September 2024, saying it wouldn’t just be a “memecoin phone.” So far, it has pre-sold 150,000 units.The Solana Seeker has gone through two sale phases: The Founder window, where the price for each device was $450, and the Early Adopter window, where the price per device was $500. Assuming the lower price window, Solana Mobile could generate at least $67.5 million in gross revenue from device sales. For comparison, the iPhone generated $199.3 billion in revenue for Apple in 2024.The new architecture that will govern future Solana Mobile devices is called TEEPIN, which stands for “Trusted Execution Environment Platform Infrastructure Network.” It is a three-layer architecture — hardware, platform, and network layers — that will allow users, developers, and device makers to participate in a trustless environment.Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder and CEO of Solana Labs, called TEEPIN “the next evolution in mobile” and a framework where trust is “verified by cryptography.”In addition, Solana Mobile is planning to launch “SKR,” the native asset of the Solana Mobile ecosystem. \""It transforms the traditional mobile business model by giving stakeholders actual ownership in the platform,” said Emmett Hollyer, general manager at Solana Mobile.

From a broad perspective, the $77 billion in Bitcoin futures open interest has undoubtedly played a role. However, a closer look at the data shows a more positive outlook for further price gains.Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.chThe current 7% annualized Bitcoin futures premium is well within the neutral range of 5% to 10%, which has been typical for the past two weeks. This indicator can easily exceed 30% during periods of strong optimism, so the current level is relatively low. At the same time, the absence of excessive leverage reduces concerns about a rally driven primarily by derivatives.Balanced order books and spot Bitcoin ETF inflows point to spot-driven rallyFor comparison, during the previous Bitcoin $109,346 all-time high on Jan. 20, the annualized futures premium reached 15%, showing a much higher level of leveraged bullish positions affecting the price. Therefore, the current Bitcoin derivatives market appears healthier, suggesting strong demand in spot markets.During the January bull run, Bitcoin’s price on Coinbase traded at a premium compared to other exchanges. This so-called Coinbase premium is not present now, which means buying pressure is more evenly spread out—a sign of a healthier market.Coinbase Bitcoin/USD relative to competitors. Source: TradingView / CointelegraphWhile excessive buying pressure on a single exchange is not necessarily bearish, it can make it easier to trigger unsustainable price surges when liquidity is low. This data supports the idea that derivatives markets were not the main driver of the recent price increases. Moreover, the $1.37 billion in net inflows to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States between May 15 and May 20 further suggests that spot buyers, rather than derivatives traders, were the primary force behind the rally.Despite the lack of conviction in Bitcoin futures, several indicators point to further upside. Forced liquidations of bearish BTC futures positions were relatively low at $170 million between May 18 and May 21, cementing the idea of a spot-driven rally. In comparison, the rally to $104,000 on May 9 triggered $538 million in liquidations over three days.Related: Is Bitcoin price close to a cycle top? — 5 indicators that help traders decideBitcoin options put-to-call ratio at Deribit.

For comparison, the put-to-call ratio at Deribit dropped to 0.4x during the previous bull run on Jan. 20, reflecting lower confidence due to reduced volumes in call (buy) options.Bitcoin’s upward movement may have been limited by macroeconomic factors, especially as the tariff war continues. Still, the potential for the price to reach $110,000 and higher is partly based on the weak position of the US Federal Reserve.

Could altcoins break above their respective overhead resistance levels?

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) in the overbought zone indicate that the bulls are in control. If the price closes above $109,588, the BTC/USDT pair could pick up momentum and skyrocket toward $130,000.The 20-day exponential moving average ($101,958) is the critical support to watch out for on the downside. A break below the 20-day EMA will be the first sign that the bulls are booking profits in a hurry.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping 20-day EMA ($2,334) and the RSI near the overbought zone indicate that buyers are in control. The ETH/USDT pair is likely to pick up momentum on a break above $2,739. That clears the path for a rally to $3,000.Contrary to this assumption, a break and close below the 20-day EMA signals that the bears are back in the game. The pair could tumble to $2,111, which is likely to attract solid buying by the bulls.XRP price predictionXRP (XRP) has been witnessing a tough battle between the buyers and sellers at the 20-day EMA ($2.35).XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. If the price skids below the 20-day EMA, the XRP/USDT pair may stay inside the $2 to $2.65 range for a while. Instead, if the price turns up sharply from the 20-day EMA and breaks above $2.65, the advantage will tilt in favor of the bulls. The pair could rally to $3 and, after that, to $3.40, where the sellers are expected to mount a strong defense.BNB price predictionBNB (BNB) bulls have held the 20-day EMA ($639) support during the pullback, indicating buying on dips. BNB/USDT daily chart.

That could sink the pair to the 50-day SMA ($609). Solana price predictionSellers failed to pull Solana (SOL) below the 20-day EMA ($164), indicating demand at lower levels.SOL/USDT daily chart.

If they can pull it off, the SOL/USDT pair could accelerate toward the target objective of $210 and then $220.If sellers want to prevent the upside, they will have to quickly tug the price below the 20-day EMA. The pair could slide to $153 and later to the 50-day SMA ($145).

2025-05-21T17:55:00.000Z,"Interest groups, lawmakers to protest Trump&#039;s memecoin dinner","Democratic leaning organizations and members of Congress have announced plans to protest what they describe as the sale of access to the office of the US president, in reference to Donald Trump’s memecoin dinner on May 22. The event’s attendees are said to have collectively spent over $100 million for the chance to meet with the US president.Since Trump’s memecoin project, Official Trump (TRUMP), announced that its top 220 tokenholders would have an opportunity to apply for an exclusive dinner with the president, many leaders in the crypto industry and US lawmakers have criticized the event, saying Trump was opening his office to potential bribery and corruption. The memecoin dinner prompted some Democratic lawmakers to withdraw support for crypto-related legislation in Congress, including the market structure and stablecoin bills.“Trump collecting gifts from foreign governments is unconstitutional,” a spokesperson for the consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen, which is planning to protest near the memecoin dinner on May 22, told Cointelegraph. “Collecting foreign government investments through his memecoin is not much better. American foreign policy should not be for sale.”Source: Public CitizenCrypto industry figures such as Tron founder Justin Sun, Kronos Research chief investment officer Vincent Liu, Hyperithm co-CEO Oh Sangrok, and Synthetix founder Kain Warwick are among the tokenholders expected to attend the dinner at the Trump National Golf Club outside Washington, DC. The memecoin project said all applicants had to pass a background check and could not be from a “[Know Your Customer] watchlist country.”Related: Democrats seek suspicious activity reports linked to Trump crypto venturesPublic Citizen, in partnership with progressive political organization Our Revolution, will hold a rally near the golf club, which Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley is expected to attend. In addition, the Arlington and Loudoun Democrats will be hosting a separate event to urge US officials to “hold [Trump] accountable,” and Democratic leadership in Congress has scheduled two press events on May 22 ahead of the dinner.“Americans cannot and will not accept President Trump’s view that positions of power exist only to benefit the holder of that power,” Ryan Ruzic, chair of the Loudoun County Democratic Committee, told Cointelegraph. “We have a moral responsibility to speak out against corruption, whatever the result may be.”Pushback on TRUMP memecoin affected crypto legislationSome lawmakers initially cited the memecoin dinner and the Trump family’s involvement with the crypto platform World Liberty Financial in opposing passage of the GENIUS Act, a bill to regulate payment stablecoins. World Liberty Financial began issuing its own USD1 stablecoin in March, prompting concerns about Trump’s conflicts of interest. However, the legislation passed a key procedural vote in the Senate on May 19 with support from Democrats, setting the bill up for debate in the chamber.“Many senators, myself included, have very real concerns about the Trump family’s use of crypto technologies to evade oversight, hide shady financial dealings, and personally profit at the expense of everyday Americans,” said Sen. Mark Warner in a statement before the May 19 vote, adding: “But we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay.”Senator Chris Murphy, who voted against advancing the GENIUS Act, called for bipartisan support in amending the bill to specifically bar a US president from issuing stablecoins. He also called on the White House to release a complete list of attendees to the memecoin dinner, suggesting that some or all of them would “try to get something from the president” in exchange for purchasing the tokens. Murphy and Senator Elizabeth Warren will attend a press event with representatives for Public Citizen on May 22. California Representative Maxine Waters, ranking member of the US House Financial Services Committee, announced a separate press conference for the same day, with plans to introduce a bill to “block Trump’s memecoin and stop his crypto corruption, once and for all.”As of May 21, the exact number of attendees to the dinner was unknown. A smaller group of 25 tokenholders also qualified to apply for “VIP tour” and reception — presumably at the White House — with Trump, but the complete list of those planning to attend was also unknown at the time of publication.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/protest-donald-trump-memecoin-dinner?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-21T17:02:48.000Z,"Is Bitcoin price close to a cycle top? — 5 indicators that help traders decide","Key takeaways:Bitcoin market cycle tops are notoriously hard to time, but combining technical and behavioral indicators can offer strong signals.The MVRV-Z Score, Pi Cycle Top indicator, trade volume trends, Puell Multiple, and exchange inflows accurately predict Bitcoin price cycle tops.Bitcoin (BTC) might be approaching the final stage of its current market cycle — a dramatic final rally followed by a sharp correction and, eventually, a bear market. For many, this could be the long-awaited climax of the past four years, and major players are preparing accordingly.Since late 2024, Bitcoin whale accumulation has surged. Glassnode data shows that the number of addresses holding over 100 BTC has jumped by almost 14%, reaching 18,200 — a level not seen since 2017. The biggest market players appear to be positioning for what could be this cycle’s final run-up.Number of BTC addresses holding over 100 BTC. Source: GlassnodeHowever, riding the rally is trickier than it looks and knowing when to exit is notoriously difficult. The lure of higher price highs fuels FOMO, driving investors to buy the top, only to face painful drawdowns or even liquidations.So, how can traders and investors spot the top before the market enters recession?Bitcoin cycle top markersSeveral technical and onchain indicators, such as MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Z-score, Pi Cycle Top, and trading volume trends, have historically been reliable in signaling when Bitcoin is nearing its peak.The MVRV-Z score compares Bitcoin’s market value to its realized value and adjusts for volatility. A high Z-score suggests Bitcoin is significantly overvalued relative to its historical cost basis. When this indicator is at a historical high, the ensuing downward trend in Bitcoin prices is likely.The Pi Cycle Top tracks BTC price dynamics using moving averages. When the 111-day moving average (111-SMA) crosses above twice the 350-day average (350-SMAx2), it signals overheating. In other words, when the short-term trend catches up to the long-term trajectory, a market top is in.Historically, all previous Bitcoin bull runs started with a notable surge in MVRV Z-score, and ended with 111-SMA crossing the longer-term trend.BTC: Pi Cycle Top + MVRV Z-score. Source: Marie Poteriaieva, GlassnodeAdditionally, lower trading volumes during price increases can be a warning sign, often signaling weakening momentum and potential for a reversal. On-balance volume (OBV), which registers cumulative volume flow, is a valuable metric for tracking this process. When OBV diverges from the price action, it is often an early reversal signal. The second leg of the 2021 bull run was a great example. While BTC price was hitting higher highs of $68,000 (compared to the previous all-time high of $63,170), trading volumes moved in a different direction, decreasing from 710,000 BTC to 628,000 BTC. This created a bearish divergence between price and volume, suggesting that fewer market participants were supporting the rally — a classic sign of waning momentum.BTC/USD 1-day, OBV. Source: Marie Poteriaieva, TradingViewProfit-taking metricsAs market cycle tops approach, long-term holders and Bitcoin miners often start locking in profits. Some valuable metrics that can track it are the Puell Multiple and exchange flows.The Puell Multiple Indicator looks at miners' revenue relative to its 365-day average. High readings indicate miners may start selling aggressively, and are often seen near market tops.Large inflows to exchanges are usually signs of distribution, as investors prepare to sell their coins. BTC total transfer volume to exchanges + Puell Multiple.

Combined, they often align with cycle tops.Related: Sorry bears — Bitcoin analysis dismisses $107K BTC price double topThe 15% ruleHistoric price activity observations might come in handy, too. Crypto market analyst Cole Garner shared his exit playbook based on whales’ behavior. His roadmap includes three steps:Euphoria. Bitcoin moves vertically for weeks, with massive $10,000+ daily candles.Whiplash. Bitcoin experiences its sharpest correction of the bull cycle. The curved parabolic trendline that’s supported the rally is broken — a clear signal that the top is likely in. Meanwhile, altcoins and meme tokens may continue pumping a little longer.Complacency. Measure 15% below Bitcoin’s all-time high. That’s the sell zone. Order books on major exchanges often show a wall of sell orders around this level — a likely institutional exit point.According to Garner, the 15% (or 16%) rule works not only in crypto but in traditional markets as well.Historical blow off-tops: BTC, ETH, gold, Nasdaq, Nikkei, Broadvision, 3D Systems.

In a May 21 social media post that begins with, “The Empire Lobbies Back,” Campbell claimed that the banking industry is especially alarmed by the potential for stablecoins to offer interest or rewards to holders. In a pointed message aimed at Democratic lawmakers, Campbell wrote that “banks want you to protect their cartel so they can keep screwing your voters.” He went on to explain how fractional reserve banking enables banks to maximize profits while offering depositors minimal interest.The banking lobby says that if stablecoins pay interest or any other type of monetary reward, banks will be “harmed,” Campbell added.An excerpt of Campbell’s X post. Source: Austin Campbell“This is naked pandering for cartel protection,” he said while urging the opposition party to avoid “screwing” its voters with supporting any type of blanket ban on stablecoin interest payments.Campbell has long advocated for sensible stablecoin legislation in the United States, warning a Congressional subcommittee in April 2023 that failing to enact such laws would push issuers overseas.Related: Pareto launches synthetic dollar backed by private creditThe rise of yield-bearing stablecoinsCampbell’s scathing assessment of the traditional banking industry comes amid a wave of stablecoin issuers launching yield-bearing tokens. As reported by Cointelegraph, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in February approved the first yield-bearing stablecoin security by Figure Markets.

In line with its current trajectory, 21st Capital co-founder Sina noted that Bitcoin is approaching a pivotal moment around the $108,000 level. The Bitcoin Quantile Model update shows that BTC’s market reflects the same “heat” that was present after President Trump’s post-election rally and the spot ETF-driven highs during Q4 2024. The model, which uses quantile regression to map Bitcoin’s price phases on a logarithmic scale, indicates the cryptocurrency is in the Transition Zone, a critical juncture before the Acceleration Phase. Throughout Q4, 2024, Bitcoin rallied by 45% after entering a price discovery period above $74,500. Bitcoin Quantile Model. Source: X.comAs illustrated in the chart, once it breaks into the \""Acceleration\"" Phase, it could trigger BTC’s next leg or the mid-phase, typically between the 33% and 66% range. Based on the model, BTC is expected to progressively target price levels of $130,000 and $163,000 in the coming months. However, anonymous Bitcoin analyst apsk32 believed a price target above $200,000 is a “reasonable” expectation for 2025. Basing the projection on Bitcoin’s “power curve,” the analyst noted that BTC’s position relative to gold has significantly improved since April. From a technical standpoint, this view is supported by the recent convergence of the Sharpe ratios for Bitcoin and gold, suggesting that the two hard assets now offer comparable risk-to-reward profiles to their investors. Fidelity’s Director of Global Macro Jurrien Timmer shed light on this development, recommending a 4:1 goal-to-Bitcoin ratio from an allocation perspective. Related: Bitcoin 'blow-off top' set at $128K with new all-time highs in sightStrong Bitcoin volumes “final straw” before new highs Crypto researcher Aylo analyzed BTC’s historical price action when the crypto asset consolidates near its all-time high level. In an X post, the analyst explained, “The data shows when BTC gets close to its previous ATH during a strong, accelerating trend with high momentum, it has historically broken out to new ATHs within a short time (days to weeks).”However, weaker trends have led to stalls or retraces between March and May 2024. Currently, Bitcoin exhibits a strong trend but lacks the necessary trading volume, which remains the final straw to confirm a breakout, a factor that could delay upward movement.Alyo added that for Bitcoin to break its all-time highs, daily trading volume should exceed the previous 10 days, be at least 1.5 times the 20-day average, and ideally sustain a 3-day increase while the price holds steady or rises.Data from CryptoQuant has reinforced Aylo’s concerns about trading volume.

This indicates fresh capital inflows into the market at higher prices. As Cointelegraph reported, holding above $2,400 was crucial to ensure a potential $3,000 retest.Ethereum: Key pricing levels.

Bitcoin (BTC) set a new high of $109,400 on May 21, rising more than 26% in the past month, according to data from TradingView. This climb to a record high came nine days after the White House announced a 90-day trade agreement between the US and China on May 12, temporarily slashing import tariffs to 10%.BTC/USD, 1-month chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe 90-day tariff suspension and the cooperative tone in negotiations removed the risk of “sudden re-escalation,” which had a significant impact on risk appetite among traditional and cryptocurrency investors, Aurelie Barthere, principal research analyst at crypto intelligence platform Nansen, told Cointelegraph.US President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs were seen as the biggest macroeconomic threat to traditional equities and cryptocurrency markets in 2025.Bitcoin briefly fell to a year-to-date low of $74,434 on April 7, five days after Trump announced his reciprocal import tariffs on April 2, sending shockwaves across global markets, with the S&P 500 losing more than $5 trillion in value, its largest drop to date.Bitcoin started its recovery on April 9 after Trump’s Liberation Day marked the “climax of uncertainty” for market participants, Michaël van de Poppe, founder of MN Consultancy, told Cointelegraph at the time.Related: Bitcoin more of a ‘diversifier’ than safe-haven asset: ReportBitcoin entered May with “near-flawless setup”Bitcoin kicked off May with a “near-flawless setup, catalyzed by a rare alignment of geopolitical de-escalation, improving regulatory optics and macroeconomic tailwinds,” according to Jag Kooner, head of derivatives at Bitfinex exchange.“The Russia–Ukraine ceasefire talks have defused one of the primary geopolitical volatility engines of the past two years,” Kooner told Cointelegraph, adding:“Rather than triggering capital flight from Bitcoin — as often seen when risk wanes — this easing is unlocking a risk-on rotation. We’re seeing capital rotate into BTC and high-beta tech as the need for geopolitical hedging fades, but liquidity remains abundant.”The capital rotation reflects a “maturing narrative” as “Bitcoin is no longer just a fear hedge — it’s increasingly a high-conviction risk asset in periods of macro stability,” Kooner said.Source: Donald J.

2025-05-21T15:00:00.000Z,"How to handle crypto trading gains and losses on your balance sheet","Key takeawaysProperly accounting for crypto assets on your balance sheet is essential for accurate tax reporting and financial transparency.Crypto trading activities should be recorded like stock trading, at fair market value on the day of purchase.In some countries, like the US, crypto losses can offset gains, so keeping track of gains and losses is important for reducing taxable income.Whether you’re an individual investor or a business, treating cryptocurrencies as assets and documenting them ensures compliance with tax laws and minimizes the risk of errors.Let’s be real, it’s easy to lose sight of what you’ve actually gained or lost, especially when it comes to crypto and its market volatility and frequent trading activities. And when it comes to accounting, especially in countries like the United States, it gets trickier because you must reflect those numbers properly on your balance sheet. If you are running a business that involves crypto or you are just a crypto investor, understanding how to account for your digital assets correctly is crucial. This guide breaks down the basics of balance sheets, handling crypto gains and losses, and what tax implications you need to account for.What is a balance sheet, and why is it needed?Think of a balance sheet as a report of your financial health. It shows what you own, owe and what’s left over at a specific point in time. It contains three main parts: Assets: What the company owns, such as cash, crypto, real estate, inventory, etc.Liabilities: What the company owes, such as loans, unpaid bills and taxesEquity: What’s left after subtracting liabilities from assets (net worth).For example, if you own $50,000 worth of crypto, and at the same time, you owe someone $20,000. In this case, your equity is $30,000. Balance sheets help you understand your financial position at a glance. They’re essential for filing taxes, attracting investors, applying for loans and complying with regulations. Balance sheets are essential in countries like the United States, where businesses must report crypto holdings accurately for tax and compliance reasons. Similarly, in the UK, European countries and Canada, balance sheets are important for businesses and are often used by individuals, especially when dealing with crypto assets. It’s not just for taxes. A well-maintained balance sheet can help you get funding, plan your finances, or simply sleep better knowing where you stand at night.How do you treat crypto on a balance sheet?One of the most common questions when preparing a balance sheet is, “How to report crypto trading gains and losses on a balance sheet?” In most jurisdictions, the crypto reporting and taxation rules are still to be decided or clarified. This also applies to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which lack definitive guidance concerning cryptocurrency accounting.As cryptocurrencies are considered assets in many jurisdictions, the fundamental concepts of accounting for assets could apply when preparing a balance sheet involving crypto transactions. Below is an example of a simplified crypto balance sheet treatment and some helpful pointers that may assist you in accounting for crypto trading in 2025.Notes to the balance sheet:Cash ($15,000): Represents fiat currency (e.g., USD) held in bank accounts or wallets, including proceeds from selling crypto or other revenue.Cryptocurrency ($20,000): Recorded at cost basis (fair market value at acquisition, less any impairment). Includes 0.5 Bitcoin (BTC) purchased at $30,000 each ($15,000 total) and 10 Ether (ETH) purchased at $500 each ($5,000 total). No impairment has been recorded, assuming the fair market value (FMV) remains above cost.Mining equipment ($5,000): Capitalized cost of crypto mining hardware, net of depreciation. The original cost was $8,000, with $3,000 accumulated depreciation over two years.Accounts payable ($2,000): Unpaid bills (e.g., for electricity or supplier services related to crypto mining operations).Taxes payable ($1,500): Estimated tax liability for realized crypto gains (e.g., from selling 0.1 BTC at a $2,000 gain, taxed at 20% long-term capital gains rate for simplicity).Retained earnings ($36,500): Accumulated profits, including crypto-related income (e.g., mining revenue, realized gains) minus expenses and taxes. Reflects net income from prior and current periods.When buying cryptocurrency with fiat moneyWhen you buy cryptocurrency with fiat money, such as dollars or euros, you’re simply exchanging one type of asset, such as cash, for another, like crypto or stocks. On your balance sheet, cryptocurrency trading activities should be recorded similarly to those of stock trading activities. As with stocks, you should record cryptocurrency on your balance sheet at its fair market value on the day of purchase. While your cash account displays a credit for the same amount, the cryptocurrency is recorded as a debit to your assets account.When selling cryptocurrency for fiat moneySelling crypto for fiat creates a change in your balance sheet: Your crypto holdings will be reduced, meaning credited, and your cash will increase, which also means that the account will be credited.If you sell for more than you paid (the original price of a token), you have a gain; if you sell for less, you record a loss. Both crypto gains and crypto losses should be tracked carefully for tax and reporting purposes.How to record crypto lossesThe difference is recorded as a loss when you sell crypto at a lower price than you bought it for. In some countries, these losses can lower your taxable income, so it can prove useful to properly document them.  However, even if the asset regains its previous price levels, impairment losses cannot be undone in accordance with GAAP’s accounting rules for intangible assets.This contrasts with IFRS, where certain intangible assets can be revalued upward under IAS 38 if an active market exists. However, crypto markets are volatile, and IFRS guidance on crypto revaluation remains unclear, so most entities stick to cost-less impairment. Businesses should consult local accounting standards and auditors for precise treatment.How to record crypto profitsIf you receive cryptocurrency as payment for goods, services or other activities, it’s treated as income at the fair market value on the date you receive it. This value is recorded as revenue and added to your assets. Later, if you sell or swap the crypto, any difference in value will result in a capital gain or loss.How to record crypto mining When cryptocurrency mining income occurs, it should be reported at the currency’s fair market value. This revenue should be shown on your income statement since it increases your assets.Similar to other revenue-generating activities, companies engaged in cryptocurrency mining are required to report their crypto profits on their balance sheet. Their mining income account will be credited as a result. Subsequently, the newly generated digital asset has to be recorded in their accounts at its fair market value.Additionally, costs related to mining operations should be recorded. For example, the cash account needs to be credited if cash is spent to cover mining costs. The purchase of mining equipment, which requires capitalization and amortization, will subsequently be deducted from the associated asset account or otherwise documented as a cost for items like utilities and supplies.Using cryptocurrency to pay suppliersPaying suppliers or vendors with cryptocurrency is like selling the asset since you have to recognize any gain or loss in relation to its original value. Therefore, the difference between the asset’s book value and its expense will be recorded as a capital gain.How to record transaction fees and exchange rates It’s critical to keep track of transaction costs and exchange rate fluctuations when trading or exchanging cryptocurrencies. Fees should be shown as an expense on the balance sheet since they lower your net gain or increase your loss. Changes in exchange rates may also have an impact on the value recorded when converting cryptocurrency into fiat, which could have an effect on your taxes and capital gains.Did you know? Cryptocurrency held for more than a year can be categorized as a long-term asset on your balance sheet in some jurisdictions, which may result in better tax treatment than short-term holdings.How are cryptocurrencies taxed?Taxation of cryptocurrencies varies by country, but your balance sheet plays a crucial role in tracking taxable events. Under current GAAP, crypto is recorded at cost and tested for impairment. IFRS allows revaluation in rare cases, but most entities use the cost model. For traders holding crypto as inventory, GAAP (ASC 330) or IFRS (IAS 2) may apply, with FMV adjustments. The lack of definitive guidance means businesses must apply judgment and document assumptions clearly. In the US, crypto is treated as property, with taxes applied to capital gains when selling or trading. The Internal Revenue Service requires reporting on your balance sheet; losses can offset gains. Also, the US introduced Form 1099-DA in 2025 for crypto brokers to report transactions, increasing compliance requirements. In the UK, cryptocurrencies are taxed under capital gains for individuals, while income tax may apply if trading is frequent or when crypto is received as income, such as through mining, staking or as payment for services.Canada follows a similar approach, taxing crypto as capital gains (50% inclusion rate) or business income for active traders. Mining income is taxable as income.In Germany, long-term holders (over a year) pay no tax on capital gains, but short-term trades over 600 euros are taxed. Notably, the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation (effective 2024) standardizes crypto reporting, impacting balance sheet documentation in member states.Accounting for Ethereum transactionsEthereum, the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts, has unique accounting needs. Here’s how to handle common Ethereum transactions on your balance sheet:Staking rewards: Staking ETH on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network generates rewards, treated as income at FMV when received. For example, receiving 0.1 ETH as a staking reward debits your “Cryptocurrency” asset account and credits “Revenue” on your income statement. Selling staked ETH later triggers a capital gain or loss.Gas fees: Ethereum transactions incur gas fees, which are expenses. Record these as a debit to “Transaction Fees” (an expense account) and a credit to “Cash” or “Cryptocurrency” if paid in ETH. For example, a $50 gas fee paid in ETH reduces your ETH holdings and is expensed.DeFi transactions: Yield farming or liquidity provision (e.g., on Uniswap) generates rewards, treated as income at FMV when received. For example, earning 100 UNI (UNI) tokens ($1,000) debits “Cryptocurrency” and credits “Revenue.” Track gas fees and token swaps as expenses or taxable events.ERC-20 tokens: Ethereum-based tokens (e.g., USDC, LINK) are separate assets. Record each at its FMV at acquisition, like ETH, and track them individually to avoid confusion.Accurate tracking of Ethereum transactions ensures compliance, especially with increased IRS scrutiny on staking and DeFi in 2025.Tools and best practices for crypto accountingManaging crypto transactions can be daunting, but these tools and tips simplify the process:Accounting software: Use platforms like CoinTracker, Koinly or CryptoTaxCalculator to track Ethereum transactions, calculate gains/losses, and generate tax reports. These tools integrate with wallets and exchanges, ensuring accurate FMV records.Regular reconciliation: Match your balance sheet’s crypto holdings to wallet/exchange records monthly to catch errors, especially for gas fees or staking rewards.Work with professionals: Crypto tax rules, especially for Ethereum’s DeFi and staking, are complex. Consult a crypto-savvy accountant to ensure compliance with IRS, His Majesty’s Revenue & Customs or other regulations.Document everything: Keep records of every Ethereum transaction, including FMV, gas fees and staking rewards, to prepare for audits or Form 1099-DA reporting in 2025.By staying organized, you’ll minimize errors and stress when filing taxes or preparing financial statements.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-trading-gains-and-losses-on-balance-sheet?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-21T15:00:00.000Z,"Crypto&#039;s real momentum isn&#039;t in the charts; it&#039;s in developer activity","Opinion by: Markus Levin, co-founder of XYOThe crypto community often experiences periods of heightened anxiety. Market downturns are often triggered by counterproductive sentiment-driven events rather than by fundamental issues, creating a significant disconnect between price behavior and the actual progress being made within the industry by the companies within it. What often goes unnoticed is how much real development happens during these downturns. While market movements capture most of the attention, teams are building faster and more deliberately behind the scenes than ever. The focus shifts away from price speculation and toward real execution. Growth happens during downturns. It's a necessary phase for projects that thrive in a volatile industry. They re-focus attention on refining their technology and business, fueling the next wave of progress.As a result, there's a disconnect between online sentiment and conversations between blockchain industry leaders. For builders and project leaders, the atmosphere is of determination, not doom.Regulators are coming on boardOne of the most promising developments is the accelerating momentum of regulation policy. Many European companies are applying for MiCA licenses in preparation for regulatory updates. There's also a significant policy shift under new US leadership as the SEC retreats from several high-profile crypto enforcement actions. The disparity between sentiment and reality serves as a reminder that price is a lagging indicator. Selloffs are triggered by uncertainty around tariff announcements and background activity such as interest rates. Material, long-term statistics speak for the virtually universal optimism among industry leaders as the number of active developers has remained stable, and the number of established developers almost doubled last year. That's an incredible jump in only one year. From hype to substanceMaturation means teams thoughtfully building, governments engaging seriously with legislation, and users demanding better UX and real utility. The industry has a well-established pattern — market corrections wipe away hype and encourage focus. The last bear market gave rise to breakthroughs in DeFi, NFTs, and zero-knowledge tech. This time, it's about real-world infrastructure, regulation-ready platforms, and next-gen scalability.What emerges in these periods tends to be less visible but more durable. Teams that remain active are often those with clear models, sufficient runway, and a willingness to adapt. These are the periods when we learn whether the systems being built can handle real-world demands. One of the most promising frontiers lies at the intersection of AI and blockchain, the most ubiquitous being within Large Language Models. AI is, however, only as good as the data it's trained on.AI systems are evolving rapidly, but their foundations are skewed. They're built primarily on data scraped from the digital-first countries that predominantly lie in the northern hemisphere, which dominates global media production and internet usage. This creates a feedback loop where Western and East Asian perspectives and widely spoken languages such as English and Mandarin are not only amplified but leave little room for necessary data from smaller populations.A report from Web3 Technologies said 60% of tier-one media on the internet is English. Prominent among these media outlets is The New York Times, which has sued OpenAI based on copyright infringement. The publication alleges that their copyright-protected data was used to train OpenAI's LLM model. Recent: The future of finance is built on Bitcoin — Ethereum was just the testnetKnowing the full extent of the global imbalance in the data creating AI outputs is impossible. Allegations like this and the results delivered when using AI tools suggest the pressing need for a solution.It's even worse. When AI systems are trained on narrow, incomplete data sets, the results can exclude billions from the benefits of emerging technologies. As IBM highlights, data bias isn't just a technical issue — it's a human one with real-world consequences in healthcare, finance, agriculture, and beyond.It's become normal to use AI data every day. We receive personalized Google search results, Adobe has built AI into its industry-standard graphic and video software, and we use AI assistants like Gemini, Grok, and ChatGPT to formulate the thoughts with which we represent ourselves. All of these tools are affected by an overwhelming bias toward the center of a bell curve within their data sets, unable to access or address less common use cases.A popular example demonstrates this issue: Until recently, image generators could not create a full wine glass. No matter what prompt you provided, a wine glass full to the edge was beyond the capabilities of all known generative AI software because they had never been provided photos of wine glasses full to the brim. Their data sets had to be updated to correct this comical problem, which revealed a much more serious one.Decentralized data offers a solution. Globally incentivized systems like DePINs enable the participation of populations that would otherwise remain underserved, allowing the valuable data they provide to come online. This improves the service for everyone, making smaller global communities more accessible to commerce and enabling them easier access to the rest of the world. It also empowers smaller data creators to monetize their data rather than relinquishing it to tech giants. Where do we go from here?The crypto industry is entering a new phase. A phase that's more productive and sustainable. Expect to see rapid growth in working infrastructure, platforms and applications that welcome knowledgeable, consumer-friendly regulations and projects that respect the time and money of their users.Opportunities within the crypto space are changing but not shrinking. Our opportunities grow as we learn from what has not worked in the last few years. They will take time to develop, but successful builders will focus on long-term, incremental change and sound business practices rather than chasing fads and short-term profits.The momentum of real progress has never been stronger, and it is precisely during times like these, when it feels like no one's watching, that the foundations of the future are laid.Opinion by: Markus Levin, co-founder of XYO.

2025-05-21T14:00:55.000Z,"AI tool claims 97% efficacy in preventing ‘address poisoning’ attacks","Crypto cybersecurity firm Trugard and onchain trust protocol Webacy have developed an artificial intelligence-based system for detecting crypto wallet address poisoning.According to a May 21 announcement shared with Cointelegraph, the new tool is part of Webacy’s crypto decisioning tools and “leverages a supervised machine learning model trained on live transaction data in conjunction with onchain analytics, feature engineering and behavioral context.” The new tool purportedly has a success score of 97%, tested across known attack cases. “Address poisoning is one of the most underreported yet costly scams in crypto, and it preys on the simplest assumption: That what you see is what you get,” said Webacy co-founder Maika Isogawa.Address poisoning detection infographic. Source: Trugard and WebacyCrypto address poisoning is a scam where attackers send small amounts of cryptocurrency from a wallet address that closely resembles a target’s real address, often with the same starting and ending characters. The goal is to trick the user into accidentally copying and reusing the attacker’s address in future transactions, resulting in lost funds.The technique exploits how users often rely on partial address matching or clipboard history when sending crypto. A January 2025 study found that over 270 million poisoning attempts occurred on BNB Chain and Ethereum between July 1, 2022, and June 30, 2024. Of those, 6,000 attempts were successful, leading to losses over $83 million.Related: What are address poisoning attacks in crypto and how to avoid them?Web2 security in a Web3 worldTrugard chief technology officer Jeremiah O’Connor told Cointelegraph that the team brings deep cybersecurity expertise from the Web2 world, which they’ve been “applying to Web3 data since the early days of crypto.” The team is applying its experience with algorithmic feature engineering from traditional systems to Web3. He added:“Most existing Web3 attack detection systems rely on static rules or basic transaction filtering. These methods often fall behind evolving attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures.“The newly developed system instead leverages machine learning to create a system that learns and adapts to address poisoning attacks. O’Connor highlighted that what sets their system apart is “its emphasis on context and pattern recognition.” Isogawa explained that “AI can detect patterns often beyond the reach of human analysis.”Related: Jameson Lopp sounds alarm on Bitcoin address poisoning attacksThe machine learning approachO’Connor said Trugard generated synthetic training data for the AI to simulate various attack patterns. Then the model was trained through supervised learning, a type of machine learning where a model is trained on labeled data, including input variables and the correct output.In such a setup, the goal is for the model to learn the relationship between inputs and outputs to predict the correct output for new, unseen inputs. Common examples include spam detection, image classification and price prediction.O’Connor said the model is also updated by training it on new data as new strategies emerge. “To top it off, we’ve built a synthetic data generation layer that lets us continuously test the model against simulated poisoning scenarios,” he said. “This has proven incredibly effective in helping the model generalize and stay robust over time.“Magazine: Crypto-Sec: Phishing scammer goes after Hedera users, address poisoner gets $70K",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-system-has-97-claimed-efficacy-in-preventing-address-poisoning-attacks?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Pendle now accounts for 30% of all yield-bearing stablecoin total value locked (TVL), roughly $3 billion, the firm said in a report shared with Cointelegraph.  Pendle noted that stablecoins make up 83% of its $4 billion total value locked, a sharp rise from less than 20% just a year ago. In contrast, assets such as Ether (ETH), which historically contributed 80–90% of Pendle’s TVL, have shrunk to less than 10% of its TVL.Traditional stablecoins like USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC) do not pass on interest to holders. With over $200 billion in circulation and US Federal Reserve interest rates at 4.3%, Pendle estimated that stablecoin holders are missing out on over $9 billion in annual yield.Pendle TVL share by assets.

The platform will be powered by Maia, an AI core engine developed by My Aion, and aims to optimize and manage systems across mobility, energy, education, healthcare and digital services. My Aion CEO Daniele Marinelli said the AI will know the user well enough to “recommend the perfect place for your anniversary dinner and book it for you without you lifting a finger.”The project will debut in Abu Dhabi before expanding internationally. It is expected to launch in 18 months. Multibillion-dollar AI project to create jobs for UAE nationalsThe project is structured under a $2.5 billion Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) model, a public-private partnership model for large-scale infrastructure and technology projects. Under the model, private sector entities construct the infrastructure, run and manage the system for a certain period. The companies usually recoup their investments and earn profits during the operational phase. At the end of the period set by the parties involved, ownership and control of the systems developed through the BOT model are transferred to the government or a public sector entity. Bold Technologies CEO Thani Al Thani Al Falasi said the initiative will support UAE job creation. “This initiative will support job creation for UAE nationals, foster local innovation and contribute meaningfully to the national AI ecosystem,” he said. My Aion’s Marinelli said that relocating to Abu Dhabi provides their global operations with a new chapter. “The UAE offers the infrastructure and institutional support needed to scale responsibly and strategically,” Marinelli said.Cointelegraph has reached out to Bold Technologies and My Aion for more information. Related: Decentralized OORT AI data hits top ranks on Google KaggleCrypto proponents say AI could benefit from digital assetsOn May 20, Catena Labs, a project led by Circle co-founder Sean Neville, announced that it will create an AI-native financial institution.

2025-05-21T08:38:10.000Z,"SEC’s Peirce says NFT royalties do not make tokens securities","United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Hester Peirce said many non-fungible tokens (NFTs), including those with mechanisms to pay creator royalties, likely fall outside the purview of federal securities laws.In a recent speech, Peirce said NFTs that allow artists to earn resale revenue do not automatically qualify as securities. Unlike stocks, NFTs are programmable assets that distribute proceeds to developers or artists. The SEC official said that mirrors how streaming platforms compensate musicians and filmmakers. “Just as streaming platforms pay royalties to the creator of a song or video each time a user plays it, an NFT can enable artists to benefit from the appreciation in the value of their work after its initial sale,” Peirce said. Peirce added that the feature does not provide NFT owners any rights or interest in any business enterprise or profits “traditionally associated with securities.”SEC never prohibited NFT royaltiesOscar Franklin Tan, chief legal officer of Enjin core contributor Atlas Development Services, told Cointelegraph that the recent remarks by Peirce on NFTs and creator royalties have been widely misunderstood. Peirce had clarified that NFTs that send resale royalties to artists are not necessarily securities, a view Tan says is legally sound but mischaracterized in some media reports. “So Hester Peirce said that an NFT that sends royalties back to the creator after a sale is not a security. This is correct, but the way some media reported this is completely out of context,” Tan told Cointelegraph. “The actual context is that this is not controversial, and it was never considered a security.”The lawyer said US securities law focuses on regulating investments and not compensating creators for their work. “The artist or creator is not an investor, not a passive third party in the NFT,” he said, noting that royalty payments are not considered investment income. Instead, Tan told Cointelegraph that this type of earning is “analogous to business income,” which the SEC does not regulate. He added: “The SEC never prohibited contracts where artists and creators get royalties from secondary sales of their work, not royalties from paper contracts or blockchain protocols.”Tan explained that the legal distinction becomes more complicated when NFTs promise shared profits from royalties to multiple holders beyond the original creator. Tan also urged regulators and market participants to apply traditional legal reasoning to new blockchain technologies. “Ask yourself, if this were done by pen and paper instead of blockchain, would there still be a regulatory issue?” he said. “If none, slow down.”Source: Oscar Franklin TanRelated: SEC charges Unicoin crypto platform over alleged $100 million fraudOpenSea calls on the SEC to exempt NFT marketplaces from oversightWhile NFT royalties may not have been a controversial SEC issue, NFT marketplaces are a different case.

The executive said that this was a win for the industry. Following the conclusion of the SEC’s investigation, OpenSea’s lawyers penned a letter to Peirce, who leads the SEC’s Crypto Task Force. OpenSea general counsel Adele Faure and deputy general counsel Laura Brookover said in an April 9 letter that NFT marketplaces don’t qualify as brokers under US securities laws. The lawyers said the marketplaces don’t execute transactions or act as intermediaries.

They will also need to establish internal Donation Review Committees to assess the appropriateness of each donation and the liquidation strategy.To reduce risks of money laundering, all donations must be routed through verified Korean won exchange accounts, with verification responsibilities placed on banks, exchanges and the nonprofits themselves.Furthermore, only cryptocurrencies listed on at least three major domestic exchanges will be eligible, and liquidation is expected to occur immediately upon receipt.Guidelines regarding nonprofits selling crypto donations.

Importantly, exchanges are barred from selling tokens on their own platforms to prevent conflicts of interest.South Korea is also tightening standards for listing digital assets. The revised rules aim to curb instability from sudden price spikes by requiring a minimum circulating supply before a token is allowed to trade and temporarily restricting market orders post-listing.So-called zombie tokens (with low volume and thin market caps) and memecoins without clear utility will face more scrutiny. For instance, exchanges must delist tokens if they fail to meet liquidity benchmarks or community engagement thresholds.Starting in June, exchanges and nonprofits can apply for real-name accounts to facilitate these sales.

2025-05-21T07:35:00.000Z,"Why crypto transfers can fail and what you must check before sending","Why crypto transfers can fail and what you must check before sending              Crypto transfers fail more often than most people realize, but user attentiveness can stop most losses.What’s often marketed as a seamless, borderless system can become frustrating when transfers fail, with no customer service hotline to call and no easy recourse to reverse mistakes. In the crypto universe, the burden of getting it right falls squarely on the shoulders of the user.But here’s the encouraging part: Most failures are preventable. Understanding why crypto transfers fail can help users avoid costly missteps, navigate the quirks of different networks and send funds with far greater confidence. With a little preparation, you can sidestep common pitfalls and take control of your crypto experience.Did you know? According to a recent survey, 37% of people cite security risks as the most significant barrier to adopting crypto for payments, a reminder of how crucial it is to prioritize security at every step.                   Common crypto transfer mistakes              A single slip — wrong address, wrong network or underpaid fee — tops the list of costly crypto-transfer mistakes.Here’s a quick look at common crypto transfer mistakes:Sending crypto to the wrong address: Blockchain transactions are irreversible. A single wrong character in the recipient’s wallet address can send funds into the void, or worse, into a stranger’s wallet.Choosing the wrong network: Sending Tether USDt (USDT) over Ethereum instead of Tron? That’s a classic mistake. Always match the network to your recipient’s supported network.Underpaying gas or fees: Lowballing crypto gas fees, also known as blockchain transaction fees, can leave your transaction stuck or pending indefinitely.Not double-checking wallet compatibility: Some wallets can’t handle certain tokens or blockchains. Always verify.Sending tokens on the wrong network — like Ethereum instead of BNB Chain — can result in permanent loss. One user learned this the hard way (as shown in the image above) after transferring crypto to Coinbase from Binance using an unsupported network.                  Failed crypto transaction explained              Even perfect-looking transactions can crumble if gas is too low, a smart contract glitches or network congestion spikes.A failed crypto transaction can happen even if all the input details seem right. One major reason is insufficient gas fees. If the gas you set is too low, blockchain validators may ignore your transaction entirely. In some cases, this causes the transaction to fail outright; in others, it remains stuck in a pending state for hours or even days.Smart contract hiccups are another hidden landmine, especially in the decentralized finance (DeFi) world. If the contract’s code has flaws or can’t handle your input, your transaction can bounce back. Add in network congestion — especially on high-traffic chains like Ethereum, where every block is a battle for space — and even well-planned transfers can stall or fail without warning.Did You Know? A study analyzing over 1.5 billion failed transactions on the Solana blockchain found that bot spamming and network congestion were significant contributors to transaction failures.                  Crypto transfer troubleshooting guide              A quick five-point checklist (address, network, explorer status, wallet queue, asset support) usually reveals why funds haven’t landed.If your crypto transfer isn’t received, don’t panic. Check these first:Confirm the recipient’s address is correct.Verify the transfer network (was it Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon, etc.).Check the status on a block explorer (like Etherscan for Ethereum or Solscan for Solana).Review your wallet and see if the transfer is still pending.Make sure the recipient wallet supports the asset you sent.If you catch an issue early, some platforms allow you to speed up or cancel a stuck transaction by paying a higher gas fee.What to check before sending cryptoPrevention is your best friend.Before sending any crypto, take a few moments to verify all the critical details. Always double-check the recipient’s wallet address. The safest method is copy-paste; never type it out manually. Ensure that the address belongs to the correct network and is compatible with the token you’re sending.Make sure the address matches the right network and can handle the token you’re sending. And don’t forget the fees. On Ethereum, for example, you’ll need some ETH in your wallet to cover gas or that transfer’s going nowhere. Also, confirm the receiving wallet can accept the token and that you're not hitting any daily or regional transfer limits imposed by the platform.Did You Know? A single copy-paste mistake cost one crypto trader $26 million in Renzo Restaked ETH (ezETH). The tokens were sent to the wrong wallet address, and recovery was impossible, even with white hat hackers trying to help.                  Crypto transfer speed and networks              Different blockchains clear at various speeds, so match your urgency to a network’s typical confirmation time.Chains like Solana, Avalanche and Tron blaze through transactions in seconds, leaving older titans like Bitcoin and Ethereum catching their breath, especially when network traffic spikes and block space gets tight. And they’re not alone. Newer players like Aptos and Sui are also pushing the limits of scale and throughput, signaling a fierce race for speed across the crypto ecosystem.That’s why knowing the average speed of the network you’re using matters. Sending Bitcoin (BTC)? Expect to wait around 10 minutes per confirmation, there are 6 of them. Moving USDT on Solana? It should arrive almost instantly. Being aware of these differences helps set realistic expectations and avoid unnecessary panic when a transfer lags. And when every second counts — whether you’re racing to secure a trade or make a payment — choosing a fast crypto network can save you time and stress.                  How the crypto Travel Rule can cause transfer failures              Regulatory hurdles like the Travel Rule can freeze transfers if sender or recipient data doesn’t line up across jurisdictions.The crypto Travel Rule requires virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to share key details about the sender and recipient when handling transfers above set limits. If that information is missing, incomplete, or doesn’t match up, your transaction can hit a wall, often getting delayed or blocked entirely. This issue pops up frequently in cross-border transfers or when moving funds to exchanges.Other problems arise from the “sunrise issue,” where some countries have adopted the Travel Rule and others haven’t. This mismatch can lead to compliance conflicts and blocked transactions. Self-hosted wallets also present a challenge: Some VASPs won’t process transfers to wallets they can’t verify. As regulations tighten, expect more of these friction points in crypto transfers.Did you know? A report by Cointelegraph Research and Onramper found that 50% of fiat-to-crypto transactions fail, even when users have completed Know Your Customer (KYC) checks. User location, banking restrictions and local regulations all play a role in whether those transactions succeed or collapse.                   How to avoid failed crypto transactions              Send a test amount, watch live gas trackers and never rush. Slow, informed moves keep transactions from failing.Avoiding failed transactions comes down to awareness and caution. First, always test with a small amount before transferring large sums. This gives you a chance to catch mistakes without losing much. Second, always monitor current gas fees, especially on volatile networks like Ethereum. Tools like Etherscan Gas Tracker and Blocknative Gas Estimator give live Ethereum gas prices. Many wallets (like MetaMask) also show gas estimates in the app. Using a reputable crypto wallet that offers real-time fee suggestions and transaction previews helps immensely. Finally, take your time. Many failed transactions happen simply because users are in a rush or feeling pressured to act fast. In crypto, speed can kill your funds.Did you know? One user paid $200 in gas fees on Ethereum for a failed transaction that returned nothing. The cause? Slippage settings were off, and the network still charged full fees.                  How to verify a crypto transfer              Plug the transaction hash into a block explorer for an instant verdict on whether your transfer is pending, confirmed or failed.Once you send crypto, the transaction hash becomes your receipt. Paste it into a block explorer of the chain you used, like Etherscan, Solscan or Tronscan, to get live updates. This will tell you if the transaction is pending, confirmed or failed, along with timestamps, block numbers and fee details.Some wallets and exchanges now offer built-in tracking tools that integrate directly with explorers. These make it easier for beginners to stay informed without needing to navigate third-party websites. If a transfer seems stuck, checking the status this way should always be your first move.                  Mastering crypto transfers: Confidence over chaos              Triple-checking details, monitoring fees and staying curious turns crypto transfers from a gamble into a confident routine. One wrong digit, one wrong network, and your funds could vanish into the void. This isn’t just about saving your wallet; it’s about owning your peace of mind.As blockchains scale and regulations tighten, the winners are those who move smart, not just fast. So here’s the vibe: Slow down to level up. Triple-check that address. Know the platform you’re using. Watch those fees. Stay cool when networks get jammed.The pros don’t rush; they prepare. Back up your keys. Keep your tools sharp. Stay curious and keep learning, because the crypto game rewards those who respect it.Master the flow, and you trade chaos for confidence. That’s when crypto becomes your playground.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/why-crypto-transfers-can-fail-and-what-you-must-check-before-sending?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

He said that the experience and positioning of dedicated crypto VCs “has compounded over time,” creating barriers for less focused investors trying to enter the space.Founded in 2001, Theta shifted its focus to digital assets in 2018 and now manages about $1.2 billion. The firm has backed leading crypto investment names such as Polychain Capital, CoinFund and Castle Island Ventures.Source: Theta CapitalRelated: AI takes nearly 60% of global venture capital dollars in Q1Crypto VC deals reboundThe fund’s close comes as crypto venture capital begins to rebound. According to Galaxy Digital, VC investment in digital assets rose 54% in the first quarter of 2025 to $4.8 billion, signaling renewed confidence in the sector after a prolonged downturn.A report from PitchBook also showed that crypto venture capital funding surged in early 2025, even as deal activity declined.The report showed that 405 VC deals were completed in Q1 2025, a 39.5% drop from the 670 recorded in the same period last year. However, that’s a modest uptick from the 372 deals seen in Q4 2024.Despite fewer deals, total funding more than doubled year-over-year, reaching $6 billion in Q1 compared to $2.6 billion in Q1 2024, also doubling from the previous quarter’s $3 billion.PitchBook’s senior crypto analyst Robert Le noted that even amid macroeconomic uncertainty, “capital continued to seek crypto’s core utility rails.”The bulk of the investment — around $2.55 billion across just 16 deals — went to companies in asset management, trading platforms and crypto financial services. Infrastructure and development firms followed, raising nearly $955 million across 30 deals.Web3-focused companies saw the third-most deals and funding, at 23 and $231.2 million, respectively.

The Tron founder claimed he controlled the top wallet on the TRUMP token leaderboard under the username “Sun,” which held roughly $19 million worth of the memecoin at a price of $13.20.According to Sun, he plans to network at the May 22 memecoin dinner, “talk crypto,” and “discuss the future” of the industry. It’s unclear why the Tron founder chose to announce his planned presence at the event now, when the leaderboard was finalized on May 12. Cointelegraph reached out to a spokesperson for Sun for comment, but had not received a response at the time of publication.Source: Justin SunThough not a surprise to many who speculated that Sun was the individual behind the memecoin purchases, his attendance at the dinner only deepens his ties to the Trump administration and the president’s family. In addition to the dinner for the 220 tokenholders, Trump said he would hold a reception and “VIP tour” for the top 25 wallets on the leaderboard.Related: What to expect at Trump’s memecoin dinnerSun spent $75 million on tokens through World Liberty Financial, the crypto platform backed by Trump’s three sons, including a $30 million investment a few weeks after the 2024 election. The Tron founder is also an adviser to the company.Before Trump won the November election, Sun had been facing a lawsuit from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed in 2023 over the alleged “orchestration of the unregistered offer and sale, manipulative trading, and unlawful touting of crypto asset securities.” In February, roughly a month after Trump took office and appointed Commissioner Mark Uyeda as acting chair of the SEC, the regulator and Sun jointly filed a motion for a federal judge to stay the case, which was granted.Memecoin’s potential conflicts of interest are affecting CongressSun’s and others’ involvement in Trump’s crypto ventures has prompted calls for investigations and oversight among many Democratic lawmakers, who argued that some individuals could use digital assets to essentially purchase influence with the president. The concerns initially slowed progress on a bill to regulate stablecoins in the Senate, the GENIUS Act, complicated by World Liberty Financial’s own stablecoin, USD1. The chamber voted to move forward on the bill on May 19, a few hours before Sun’s announcement.“How convenient: the day after the Senate advances the GENIUS Act, Justin Sun — a major investor in the Trump family crypto venture — announces he’s getting a private dinner as the president’s top crypto buyer,” said Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, according to Bloomberg. “It’s critical that everyone understands the GENIUS Act doesn’t stop this type of corruption — it greenlights it.”At a May 20 oversight hearing, Maryland Representative Glenn Ivey questioned SEC Chair Paul Atkins on Sun’s case being stayed, as well as his investments in World Liberty Financial and Trump’s memecoin. Though the case was stayed before Atkins was sworn in as chair, Ivey expressed concern about the timeline between Sun’s investments and the SEC not pursuing its own enforcement action.The memecoin dinner applicants are likely still subject to background checks before meeting Trump in person. As of May 20, those planning to attend included Kronos Research chief investment officer Vincent Liu, Hyperithm co-CEO Oh Sangrok, Synthetix founder Kain Warwick, a consultant named Vincent Deriu, crypto user Morten Christensen, a World Liberty Financial adviser going by the pseudonym “Ogle,” and a representative from the startup MemeCore.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/justin-sun-attend-trump-dinner-with-memecoin-backers?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: CoinGlassWhile it's impossible to predict what could spark a breakout above $108,000 to force those leveraged shorts to unwind, there is growing optimism tied to rising concerns over United States fiscal debt. Uncertainty remains about how the government plans to achieve economic growth while reducing spending, especially in light of ongoing disagreement between Democratic and Republican lawmakers.More importantly, yields on the 20-year US Treasury remain close to 5%, up from 4.82% two weeks earlier. Weak demand for long-term government debt may compel the US Federal Reserve to step in as the buyer of last resort to maintain market stability, reversing a 26-month trend. This approach puts downward pressure on the US dollar and drives investors to seek alternative hedging strategies, including Bitcoin.Gold dominates, but Bitcoin absorbs flow amid reserve reallocationsGold remains the dominant alternative asset, but its 24% year-to-date gains in 2025 and $22 trillion market capitalization make it less attractive to many investors. For context, the entire S&P 500 index is valued at $53 trillion, while US bank deposits and Treasury bills (M1) amount to $18.6 trillion. In contrast, Bitcoin currently represents a $2.1 trillion asset class, roughly equivalent in size to silver.Meanwhile, some regions, notably the US, have begun laying the groundwork to shift portions of their gold reserves into Bitcoin—an action that could easily propel BTC to a new all-time high. A modest 5% reallocation from gold into Bitcoin by those nations would translate into a $105 billion inflow, equivalent to 1 million BTC at a price of $105,000. Related: Bitcoin ready to ‘vaporize’ shorts once price discovery above $110K beginsFor perspective, Strategy, the US-listed firm led by Michael Saylor, currently holds 576,230 BTC. There is little doubt that institutional buying remains the primary catalyst for Bitcoin to break above the $108,000 level. Such a move would trigger the liquidation of heavily leveraged bearish positions, likely accelerating the push to a new all-time high. However, persistent macroeconomic uncertainty continues to weigh on overall investor sentiment.As Bitcoin flirts with the $107,000 mark, those holding short positions face heightened risk of forced liquidations—an outcome that could further fuel upward momentum in price.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

A bull flag is a continuation pattern that follows a sharp rally (black flagpole) to $2,730 from $1,900, with the current range forming the flag. Ethereum 1-day chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewA bullish breakout above $2,600 could target $3,600, which is calculated by adding the flagpole height to the breakout point, but the immediate key area of interest remains between the resistance range at $3,100-$3,000. The 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) supports the lower range. The relative strength index (RSI), although still near the overbought region, has significantly cooled over the past few days. An ETH breakout with rising RSI and volume could confirm the bullish move, while a drop below $2,400 risks invalidating the pattern.Can Ether reclaim the Gaussian Channel midline?On May 20, Ether showed a significant trend shift as it attempted to reclaim the mid-line of the 2-week Gaussian Channel, a technical indicator used to identify price trends. The Gaussian or Normal Distribution Channel plots price movements within a dynamic range, adapting to market volatility. Historically, when ETH crosses above this mid-line, significant rallies often follow. In 2023, ETH surged 93% to $4,000 after a similar crossover, while in 2020, it skyrocketed by 1,820%, sparking a massive altcoin rally.Ethereum Gaussian channel analysis.

Likewise, crypto trader Merlijn noted a golden cross between the 50-day SMA and 200-day SMA (simple moving average), which could further strengthen an imminent ETH breakout. It is important to note that the golden cross is on a 12-hour chart, which is less dependable than the one-day chart. Related: Bitcoin fractal analysis forecasts new all-time highs above $110K by end of weekTraders exercise caution ahead of possible ‘range-bound environment’Popular crypto trader XO noted that Ethereum is consolidating under a “decent” resistance level below the $2,800 mark. The trader expects a correction if ETH cannot break above $2,800 over the next few days. The analyst said,“I am leaning toward price carving out a range bound environment for at least several weeks potentially longer, and once again becoming a buyer.”A contrarian outlook to bulls can also be observed with ETH prices oscillating under the Fibonacci levels. Cointelegraph reported that Ether recently retested the 0.5 to 0.618 Fib levels, which could trigger a short-term correction for ETH. In such a scenario, the immediate area of support remains around $2,150 and $1,900, possibly slowing down the bullish momentum for a prolonged period. Ethereum 1-week price analysis.

2025-05-20T18:00:00.000Z,"Coinbase CEO&#039;s journey from no &#039;political causes&#039; to hiring DOGE staff","Five years ago, Brian Armstrong wanted employees of his cryptocurrency exchange to refrain from expressing political views at work. Now, the Coinbase CEO seems to be open to involvement with Republican figures, including members of US President Donald Trump’s inner circle.In a May 13 X post, Armstrong said members of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team, spearheaded by Elon Musk, though not set up as an actual department, would be welcome to implement cost-cutting changes at Coinbase after leaving the US government. Armstrong offered to set up an accelerated onboarding process with the exchange, responding to an interview in which at least one DOGE staffer felt ostracized from Harvard University, where he had been enrolled.“If you are looking for your next mission after serving your country, consider helping create a more efficient financial system for the world at Coinbase,” Armstrong said.Since assuming a government position at the White House in January, Musk and the DOGE team have faced criticism from both sides of the aisle over their cuts, which often forced out or fired experienced employees without proper notice. Lawsuits halting DOGE’s efforts or challenging dismissals are pending in federal court from parties alleging illegal or unconstitutional actions.Coinbase once called itself a ‘mission-focused company’Armstrong’s remarks, suggesting approval of DOGE’s actions, represented a sharp departure from the CEO’s position before Trump’s second term. At the time, many of the companies and executives in California’s Silicon Valley seemed to be more publicly aligned with Democrats. In 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the death of George Floyd at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis spurred nationwide outrage and protests, prompting many companies to take a public position. Armstrong issued a notice at the time saying that Coinbase was a “mission-focused company” that didn’t “advocate for any particular causes or candidates.”In response to Armstrong not publicly supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, many Coinbase employees organized a walkout. The CEO responded by claiming the crypto exchange had an “apolitical culture” and that roughly 5% of Coinbase staff who “didn’t feel they could be on board with this direction” had accepted an exit package.Related: Coinbase considered Saylor-like Bitcoin strategy before opting out: BloombergLess than a month later, Armstrong retweeted a post suggesting he could support Kanye West for US President in 2020. After that time, the CEO made few public statements related to politics and US laws, though he did push for clarification on crypto tax rules in 2021.Stand with Crypto moves Coinbase closer to political advocacyIt’s not entirely clear how Armstrong, at least in public, moved to be more aligned with political figures. However, for Coinbase, which the CEO said was intended to be “apolitical,” the change seemed to have started around the time the company received a Wells notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in March 2023, suggesting a potential enforcement action.Armstrong, like many in the crypto industry, had often criticized the SEC before 2023 for not offering regulatory guidelines to follow, but the Wells notice and subsequent lawsuit seemed to move Coinbase from participating in a national political discussion on digital assets to outright advocacy. The company announced the launch of the Stand with Crypto Alliance in August 2023, a group “focused on mobilizing the crypto community to directly engage in the legislative process.”Before Stand with Crypto, Armstrong used his platform to call on crypto supporters to contact their elected officials about digital asset bills moving through Congress. Even with this initiative tied to the exchange and CEO, the focus wasn’t on partisan politics, but “common-sense legislation to protect consumers and their right to crypto.” “Being anti-crypto is a really bad political strategy going into 2024,” said Armstrong in a December 2023 X post, in response to legislation aimed at fighting money laundering with digital assets.Enter Trump and the 2024 election cycleIn contrast to the 2020 election and even the 2022 midterms, the 2024 cycle stood out in more ways than one. For the first time, a presidential candidate was openly advocating for policies favoring cryptocurrency. The amount of money flowing from companies in the industry, including Coinbase, into federal elections also reached a record high.Stand with Crypto, as an advocacy organization, was no exception. The group launched its own political action committee (PAC) in May 2024, allowing it to influence the elections through media buys and direct contributions. Though Stand with Crypto still organized like-minded voters, its efforts included a renewed focus on money.It stood alongside the Fairshake PAC, a committee backed by roughly $45 million from Coinbase and $45 million from Ripple, which spent more than $130 million in the 2024 election cycle. Armstrong personally contributed $1 million to Fairshake.Though the Coinbase CEO suggested a political preference, he seemed not to take a strong position at the exchange ahead of the election. In Coinbase’s shareholder letter for the third quarter of 2024, the exchange said it was “prepared to work with either administration” in the US, whether that meant Trump or Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.More front-facing in Washington, DCArmstrong became more of a presence on Capitol Hill and among members of the Trump administration after the results of the 2024 election. He personally met with the then-president-elect in November and reportedly attended at least one of the inauguration events with other cryptocurrency executives. Coinbase also donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund.In February, the exchange announced that the SEC would be dropping its enforcement action, marking one of many crypto-related lawsuits the regulator has dismissed under Trump. Armstrong said at the time that the move was “an important signal about where things are going.” The CEO was going to Washington, DC, seemingly more frequently than he had before this administration took power. In addition to inauguration events, Armstrong attended a crypto summit at the White House with Trump and other high-level executives and spoke with lawmakers in the Capitol to support bills establishing a regulatory framework for payment stablecoins and crypto markets. Coinbase CEO in the US Capitol rotunda on May 14.
