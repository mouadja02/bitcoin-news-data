FIFA’s layer-1 (L1) blockchain will be powered by the Avalanche network’s scalability-focused infrastructure for the association’s five billion fans worldwide. The move comes nearly a month after FIFA announced its initial plans to launch a new network for its blockchain-based collectibles. AvaCloud’s Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility will enable smoother integration with decentralized wallets and applications. Related: Bitcoin hits new all-time high of $109K as trade war tensions ease The move will enable FIFA to deliver “unique digital collectibles and immersive fan experiences, powered by the speed, scalability, and EVM compatibility,” according to Francesco Abbate, CEO of Modex and FIFA Collect. “The decision was based on a rigorous analysis of key factors including performance, security, transaction fees, customizability, and scalability,” Abbate stated in a May 22 announcement shared with Cointelegraph.

In a bold (and awesome) step toward mainstream crypto integration, Volatility Shares will officially launch the first-ever 1x XRP Futures ETF, and trade under the ticker $XRPI on Nasdaq. This debut marks a historic first for Ripple’s native token and signals that XRP may finally be stepping into the ETF spotlight long dominated by Bitcoin and Ethereum. “Good signal that there will be demand for this one,” noted Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, pointing to surging interest in crypto-linked investment vehicles. VolatilityShares is launching the first-ever XRP futures ETF tomorrow, ticker $XRPI .. yes there is a 2x XRP already on market (this is first 1x) and it has $120m aum and trades $35m/day. Good signal that there will be demand for this one. pic.twitter.com/rCooyNZgu0 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) May 21, 2025 Here’s what you should know. Inside the XRPI Launch: Structure, Exposure, and Strategy Filed with the U.S. SEC on May 21, the XRPI ETF is part of the Volatility Shares Trust and offers indirect exposure to XRP futures via a wholly-owned Cayman Islands subsidiary. The fund aims to invest at least 80% of its net assets in XRP-linked instruments – providing regulated access to Ripple’s price action without requiring investors to hold the token itself. This 1x product stands out in a space mostly populated by leveraged plays, making it a more measured approach for those seeking XRP exposure without amplified volatility. Because some like playing it safe and there’s nothing wrong about that! The Race for Leverage: XRP’s ETF Wars Heat Up This isn’t the last stop for Volatility Shares. The firm is preparing to roll out a 2x XRP futures ETF, promising double the daily price appreciation of XRP via leveraged exposure. Teucrium Investment Advisors launched its 2x leveraged XRP ETF ($XXRP) on April 8, drawing $5.43 million in debut volume and now boasting $120 million in AUM with $35 million in daily trading volume. The demand is clear AND growing. All Eyes on XRP The timing couldn’t be better. Just days ago, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) rolled out XRP Futures and Micro XRP Futures, with CME’s crypto head Giovanni Vicioso noting increased appetite for “regulated derivatives products across a wider range of tokens.” Meanwhile, the race for a spot XRP ETF is accelerating. Heavyweights like Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, and 21Shares are already lining up. With new SEC Chair Paul Atkins – a noted crypto ally – at the helm, Polymarket betters now place 83% odds on a spot XRP ETF approval this year. Those are some good odds, right?

2025-05-22T10:43:14.000Z,"Bitcoin tops Amazon market cap on ‘Pizza Day’ as price sets new highs","The market cap of the world’s first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, surpassed that of retail and tech behemoth Amazon on “Bitcoin Pizza Day.” Market data shows that Bitcoin ( BTC ) had a market cap of $2.205 trillion at the time of writing, $70 billion more than the $2.135 trillion Amazon valuation. “By surpassing Amazon in terms of capitalization, Bitcoin has attracted even more attention from the non-crypto audience,” said Alex Obchakevich, founder of Obchakevich Research. Obchakevich said the latest rally “will strengthen confidence in Bitcoin and lead to new injections into the crypto market.” The surge came as Bitcoin set a new all-time high and traded above $110,000, which Obchavich said will “attract new investors to large funds.” Obchakevich noted that institutional players continue to expand their role in the digital asset space: “In May, BlackRock became the second largest bitcoin holder after Satoshi Nakamoto, surpassing Binance in this indicator.” Hassan Khan, the CEO of Bitcoin liquidity platform Ordeez, told Cointelegraph that “this is a structural change.” He explained that “Bitcoin is no longer simply a hedge, it’s in the process of becoming a benchmark currency.” Related: Bitcoin ‘looks exhausted’ as next bear market yields $69K target The crypto market approaches new highs According to CoinMarketCap data , the total cryptocurrency market cap stood at $3.49 trillion at the time of writing.

The current open interest on crypto derivatives is $756.16 billion for perpetual swaps and $3.24 billion for futures. Looking into the future, Obchakevich shared his view on Bitcoin’s direction: “We are moving gradually towards $200,000, with gradual adjustments. I am sure that this year we will see Bitcoin at $150,000 and $90,000.“ Khan said that “large net inflows to ETFs and increasing open interest demonstrate that institutional confidence is growing.” Looking forward, he said: “Short term profit taking and macro rate uncertainty are tempering momentum. But below-the-surface metrics point to continued high conviction. The foundation is more solid than in any other cycle before it.“ Related: BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF notches 2-week high inflow as BTC nears $112K Today is a special day for Bitcoin Today, May 22, is “Bitcoin Pizza Day,” a recurrence commemorating May 22, 2010, when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz made the first documented purchase of goods using Bitcoin , paying 10,000 BTC for two Papa John’s pizzas. “What was once considered a highly speculative risk has evolved into a serious asset class,” said Ulli Spankowski, chief digital officer at Boerse Stuttgart Group.

Bitcoin continues to break records, rising above $111,000 in the morning hours. While it is stated that the new record in BTC is due to the increasing interest of institutional investors, the rally is expected to continue. At this point, Presto Research analyst Min Jung said that Bitcoin’s recent rise above $111,000 was largely driven by institutional accumulation, with major firms such as Strategy, Metaplanet, and Twenty One Capital making the biggest contributions. Jung noted that this cycle is different from other bull cycles, arguing that this cycle is driven by long-term institutional capital, unlike previous bull runs that were dominated by retail speculation. Despite the new records, the bull run is still in its early stages, Jung said, adding that the current uptrend is a sign of broader institutional adoption and he expects the rally to continue. “Bitcoin’s surge above $111,000 is driven primarily by treasury holdings from firms like Strategy, Metaplanet, and Twenty One Capital. “Unlike previous bull runs, this rally appears to be fueled by institutional and long-term capital rather than retail speculation.” Jung finally added that they expect Bitcoin to reach $210,000 by the end of 2025.

With sentiment largely bullish, the potential for the benchmark digital asset to go parabolic in coming weeks and months has analysts pointing to what could be the key levels to watch. This outlook has drawn the market’s attention to Bitcoin Pepe – the cryptocurrency that looks set to derive momentum from BTC and SOL. Bulls target gains as Bitcoin price hits $111k Standard Chartered recently forecast Bitcoin’s value will reach $500k or higher in the next four years. Notably, the bank’s analysts see BTC skyrocketing amid institutional adoption and US support for crypto. Continued demand as shown via spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) add to this outlook. On Wednesday, May 21, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas pointed to BlackRock’s IBIT ETF and its inflows. Eric Balchunas @EricBalchunas · Follow $IBIT is going to post its 2nd biggest volume day ever today (outside chance it ends with most). Classic feeding frenzy in effect, new ATHs will do that, eg last time traded this much was 1/23 (last ATH). All the btc ETFs are elevated, most gonna see 2x their average. Flows 10:26 pm · 21 May 2025 877 Reply Copy link Read 44 replies This trajectory, though with a few bumps and dumps in between, allude to overall long-term bullish sentiment. Indeed Bitcoin’s surge to a new ATH above $111k comes as the market celebrates the famous ‘Bitcoin Pizza Day.’ Pizza Day represents the day developer Laszlo Hanyecz bought two pizzas for 10,000 BTC. It is now 15 years since and the Bitcoin price has exploded from nearly zero to over $111k . Hanyecz’ BTC could be worth over $1.1 billion today. CyptoQuant says the 10k BTC for pizza was a high price. However, it is what helped turn Bitcoin into a payment option. Growth has been relentless since. Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which adopted Bitcoin as a treasury asset in 2020, has since acquired a staggering $40 billion worth of the coin. In the short five years, the company’s BTC portfolio has an unrealised profit that currently stands at more than $23.8 billion. The question is – does Bitcoin price still have room to go up from here? Most analysts are bullish. Is Bitcoin Pepe worth a look as BTC rallies? Altcoins are retesting some critical levels as top coins such as Ethereum (ETH), XRP (XRP) and Solana (SOL) consolidate amid potentially rising risk asset markets ride broader tailwinds. This is as Bitcoin sees institutional interest mount. On May 21, as BTC spiked to a new ATH, Strategy founder Michael Saylor said buying at the top will still be profitable when price doubles and even triples from there. Investors looking to ride this bull market potential are thus eyeing likely gems. Michael Saylor @saylor · Follow If you’re not buying bitcoin at the all-time high, you’re leaving money on the table. 6:40 pm · 21 May 2025 0 Reply Copy link Read more on Twitter A rising tide benefits all boats is what has the altcoin market upbeat. While not similar to previous cycles, there is the acknowledgement that capital will rotate as inflows hit record highs. That means increased interest. Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP), going live on exchanges soon, could be the best memecoin to ride this sentiment. It’s the first meme layer 2 on Bitcoin, a project that eyes Bitcoin’s $2 trillion market. Combining memecoins, BTC and Solana makes Bitcoin Pepe stand out from the crowd. Ahead of its market debut, Bitcoin Pepe’s presale has smashed past $10 million in early bids. Meanwhile, the project has demonstrated its potential for traction with multiple key strategic partnerships, including with Super Meme, Catamoto and Plena Finance. Upcoming market debut, partnerships and roadmap milestones as well as BTC forecast combine to strengthen BPEP’s bullish outlook. With 9 days to go before the Bitcoin Pepe presale ends on May 31,2025, this might be the best time to buy this altcoin. Currently, the BPEP token is available at a hugely discounted price of $0.0359.

2025-05-22T10:32:32.000Z,"Crypto Confidence Returns: Bitcoin Hits New Peak Above $110,000","Bitcoin price reclaimed a bullish edge this week, topping $111,000 for the first time in its history and rallying more than 33% over the past month. The surge reflects institutional demand, ETF inflows, and growing confidence in U.S. regulatory clarity. Inflows into U.S. Bitcoin ETFs alone surpassed $3.6 billion in May, their largest monthly total since January, while Bitcoin briefly touched $111,816 during Asian trading on May 22, 2025. At the same time, the U.S. Senate moved forward on the bipartisan GENIUS Act, a stablecoin regulation bill analysts say could expand the market from $248 billion today to $2.5 trillion by 2030. Traders are now pricing in targets between $125,000 and $300,000 by late June. Bitcoin Price Hits New ATH Bitcoin price jumped as much as 2.2% to $111,492 in early Asian trading on May 22, 2025, before settling slightly lower. The rally sent Bitcoin’s one-month gain to over 33%, reversing a 25% correction from its January high above $100,000. BTC/USDT Chart| Source: TradingView Ethereum rose 4.5% to $2,619, and Solana climbed 1.9% to $176, underscoring a broad crypto upswing. According to FundFlows data, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs drew more than $3.6 billion in new capital this month, their largest inflow since January 2025. Strategy, the largest publicly traded Bitcoin holder, boosted its position by over $50 billion this quarter, reinforcing a trend of corporate accumulation. Twenty-One Capital, backed by Cantor Fitzgerald and SoftBank, also announced significant Bitcoin purchases, mirroring Strategy’s model. On May 20, 2025, the U.S. Senate passed a procedural vote on the GENIUS Act, a bipartisan bill to regulate dollar-pegged stablecoins. Market participants view the legislation as a critical step toward clearer rules and reduced legal uncertainty for crypto firms. Under the new framework, Standard Chartered projects stablecoin market growth to $2.5 trillion by 2030, up from $248 billion today. Options Market Sentiment Deribit data show peak open interest around the $110,000, $120,000, and $300,000 strike prices for contracts expiring June 27, indicating traders expect further gains. Options traders now forecast a rally to $120,000 by month-end, with bullish positions swamping bearish bets. Analysts at Deutsche Bank note that easing U.S.-China trade tensions and a softer dollar have reinforced Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge. Tony Sycamore of IG Markets described the January–April pullback—from above $100,000 to below $75,000—as a healthy correction within a longer uptrend. Bloomberg reported that growing bipartisan support in Congress for crypto regulation underpins renewed institutional interest. Bitcoin’s ascent above $111,000 underscores that market sentiment now hinges as much on policy and institutional flows as on macroeconomic trends . The convergence of ETF inflows, corporate purchases, and stablecoin legislation has reignited investor confidence. As the GENIUS Act progresses and options markets price in even higher targets, traders and investors alike will watch to see if Bitcoin can sustain its momentum and reassert its role as a leading digital asset. BTC is currently trading at $110,480 after a slight correction from new ATH, according to CoinGecko data.

Crypto prices buoyed by Bitcoin’s new all-time highs Today’s gains were led by Bitcoin ( BTC ), which broke through $111,000 for the first time on May 22, setting a fresh all-time high , as market sentiment continues to improve after last month's tariff-induced sell-off . Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows BTC rose as much as 7.3% to a new record high of $111,888 on May 22 from a low of $104,200 on May 21, lifting the broader crypto market with it. Major altcoins like Ether ( ETH ), Cardano ( ADA ), and Solana ( SOL ) followed Bitcoin’s lead and flashed green, as shown in the chart below. 24-hour market performance of top 10 cryptocurrencies, May 22. Source: CoinMarketCap The performance comes from easing trade tension between the United States and China and Moody's downgrading the US debt rating . This has prompted investors to turn to Bitcoin as a store of value , boosting overall crypto market sentiment. Additionally, the US Dollar Index (DXY) has been on a downtrend since early November and is down more than 9.84% to 99.096 from its Jan. 13 peak of 110.17. The DXY has dropped more than 2.6% over the last 10 days. DXY daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView Crypto market participants often point to increased involvement from traditional financial firms as a reason for crypto gains. This week, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said that the bank will offer clients access to Bitcoin after years of skepticism. Massive short liquidations fuel price surge Another driver of today’s rally is a wave of short liquidations that have triggered a powerful short squeeze, as data from CoinGlass shows. In the past 24 hours, over $495 million in crypto positions have been liquidated across the crypto market, with approximately $300 million representing short position liquidations. Short BTC leveraged positions totaling $173 million have also been liquidated on the day. Total crypto liquidations. Source: CoinGlass The largest single liquidation occurred on Bybit, where a BTC/USD position worth $6.36 million was liquidated. The magnitude of this liquidation mirrors the Nov. 6 liquidation event, where more than $426 million in short leveraged positions were liquidated, accompanying a 16% increase ($356 billion) in the total crypto market capitalization on the same day. The short squeeze has played a crucial role in amplifying the current rally, particularly for Bitcoin, which has led the market with its charge past $110,000. Related: Bitcoin 'looks exhausted' as next bear market yields $69K target Total market cap validates bull flag TOTAL — the combined market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies — confirmed a bull flag pattern on May 20, when it breached the upper boundary of the flag in the weekly timeframe at $3.27 trillion, coinciding with the 50 simple moving average (SMA). TOTAL is currently testing the resistance level at the $3.5 trillion psychological level, as shown in the chart below. A high volume move above this level could accelerate the recent bullish momentum toward the technical target of the prevailing chary pattern at $3.84 trillion — a 17% ascent from the current level. TOTAL/USD four-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView The relative strength index (RSI) is at 70 and has risen from 44 over the last 48 hours, indicating increasing bullish momentum. Conversely, a four-hour candlestick close below $3.35 trillion will likely push the price to test the upper boundary of the flag at $3.27 trillion. Losing this support will invalidate the bullish thesis, and TOTAL could continue its consolidation within the flag for a few more days.

2025-05-22T10:26:00.000Z,"Bitcoin Eyes $120K: Spot ETFs and Institutional Inflows Are Reshaping BTC’s Trajectory","Bitcoin (BTC) has entered uncharted territory, smashing through its previous all-time high (ATH) to near $112,000 on May 22. While casual observers may chalk up this rally to the typical retail-fueled frenzies of past bull runs, analysts at Santiment are saying BTC’s current climb is being shaped by disciplined accumulation from institutional whales, and it may be just the beginning. The experts are projecting a near-term target of $115,000 to $120,000 as the number one cryptocurrency transforms from a speculative asset to a cornerstone of institutional portfolios. Institutional Tsunami Reshaping Bitcoin’s Market Structure On May 21, with BTC at around $109,500, Santiment noted that the cryptocurrency’s surge past its previous ATH of $109,241, set on the day Donald Trump was inaugurated as U.S. president, came amid surprisingly low FOMO among retail traders. Ironically, this lack of retail hype may have cleared the runway for institutional capital to steadily push prices higher without the volatility often seen in retail-driven runs. “One of the key drivers behind Bitcoin’s ascent has been a growing wave of institutional investments,” wrote Santiment, highlighting how easing macro tensions and six straight days of inflows into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) helped push BTC to a record high. At the center of this institutional frenzy is BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT. As of May 22, it holds 636,120 BTC, 2,000 more than the combined holdings of the next 14 biggest U.S. spot ETFs . The fund has become the preferred vehicle for heavyweight investors, with recent SEC filings showing that Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund Mubadala and hedge fund Citadel have significantly expanded their stakes. However, this meteoric rise also poses questions about long-term market structure, with an analysis by CryptoQuant showing that IBIT’s size is creating a monopoly-like concentration that could squeeze out smaller issuers. Meanwhile, corporate accumulators like Michael Saylor’s Strategy and Japan’s Metaplanet are still buying aggressively, with the two firms recently splashing $764 million and $104 million respectively to stack up their holdings. Clear Runway to $120K Technically, Bitcoin is now deep in price discovery mode . Over the past 30 days, it has gained 25.5%, and is up 58.7% year-over-year. With its price hovering around $110,915 at the time of writing, the asset has pumped more than 47% since its April 7 crash to $75,000. According to Santiment, the growing presence of the flagship crypto asset in traditional financial frameworks is changing its perception and giving it new status as a mainstream store of value. In their estimation, investor sentiment and market dynamics could soon push BTC to fresh highs. “Depending on the crowd’s own greed, we could see $115K-$120k in the near future,” the platform tweeted. Additionally, market watchers think that with search interest and social chatter about Bitcoin at bear market lows, the divergence between price action and public enthusiasm could make the cryptocurrency’s current rally more sustainable than those before, especially with institutional whales in control.

2025-05-22T10:21:18.000Z,"Can ChatGPT-powered AI agents really trade crypto for you?","Key takeaways ChatGPT-powered AI agents automate trading tasks using natural language prompts and API integrations, improving speed and consistency. Successes occur when ChatGPT is used as a support tool, not a fully autonomous trading system. Failures happen when traders over-rely on ChatGPT without real-time data, proper risk management or manual oversight. Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance. What if a crypto trader didn’t need to constantly check charts, worry about emotions, or stay up all night watching for sudden price swings? What if those tasks could be handled by an intelligent agent that understands instructions in plain English — and reacts within milliseconds? That’s where ChatGPT-powered AI agents come in. These tools combine natural language processing with real-time trading logic to automate decision-making in one of the world’s most volatile markets. From rebalancing portfolios to reacting to market sentiment, ChatGPT is being adapted to act as a trading assistant, risk manager and market analyst — all rolled into one. But can it truly match or even outperform human intuition? This article explores how far these agents have come, where they shine and where they still fall short. How ChatGPT-powered AI agents operate in cryptocurrency markets ChatGPT-powered AI agents are changing how people interact with crypto markets. These tools combine ChatGPT’s language abilities with external trading tools and APIs to help users monitor prices, understand trends and even place trades automatically. Instead of just reacting to charts or numbers, ChatGPT can understand plain language commands like “Buy Ethereum if the price drops below $2,000” or “Sell Bitcoin if RSI goes above 70.” These AI trading assistants can work with major platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, OKX and other centralized or decentralized exchanges and can also tap into decentralized finance (DeFi) tools and smart contracts . With the right setup, ChatGPT can help automate trading strategies based on both technical data and market news. Success stories vs. failures in ChatGPT-powered crypto trading Some traders have used ChatGPT to assist in automating parts of their crypto trading processes, particularly for strategy generation and sentiment analysis . For example, a user shared on Reddit that they used a ChatGPT-based AI agent for technical analysis on Ether ( ETH ), feeding it four-hour and daily chart screenshots. By interpreting market sentiment, support and resistance zones, and other indicators, they managed to make $6,500 in profits. Similarly, in the broader crypto sector, ChatGPT has been applied to support project development activities such as drafting white papers and marketing content. A notable example is the launch of the “TURBO” memecoin, which reportedly reached a market capitalization of over $50 million in 2024. In this case, ChatGPT was used to streamline documentation and communication rather than manage trading activity, illustrating its usefulness as a support tool in crypto-related initiatives. However, limitations are evident when ChatGPT is applied beyond its core design. While ChatGPT could suggest a trading portfolio and explain its reasoning clearly, it lacks access to real-time market data and couldn’t respond to sudden volatility. In one instance, ChatGPT was allocated $100 across multiple tokens but failed to actively manage the portfolio as prices fluctuated. This resulted in missed opportunities and underperformance compared to dynamic algorithmic strategies. Individual experiences reinforce these observations. A Redditor exposed a scam where a YouTuber promoted a “ChatGPT trading bot” tutorial that led users to deploy malicious smart contracts. The contracts, generated using ChatGPT and passed off as safe, were designed to drain user wallets once funded. Victims collectively lost $17,240 in ETH, highlighting the danger of blindly trusting AI-generated code without proper auditing. Even when asked, “If I use ChatGPT to build an AI agent for crypto trading, can I become a millionaire?” ChatGPT responded with a realistic outlook — acknowledging that while it’s possible, success depends on having a profitable strategy, disciplined risk management, and the ability to scale effectively. Here is ChatGPT’s response: These cases suggest that while ChatGPT can support certain elements of the trading process, it should not be treated as a standalone solution for autonomous crypto trading. AI in crypto trading: Key benefits and limitations AI tools like ChatGPT are increasingly being integrated into crypto trading workflows to improve speed, accuracy and efficiency. While they offer important advantages, they also carry specific limitations that traders must actively manage. Below are the main benefits and challenges: Key benefits of using AI for crypto trading AI bots can execute trades in milliseconds, crucial for capturing opportunities in fast-moving crypto markets. Bots follow pre-programmed rules precisely, eliminating emotional biases that often affect human traders. Crypto markets are always open, and AI bots can monitor and act around the clock without interruption. A single bot can manage multiple trading pairs, exchanges and strategies simultaneously. ChatGPT can understand specific prompts like “Rebalance every Monday” or “Set stop-loss at 5%,” allowing flexible automation. Limitations of ChatGPT in cryptocurrency trading ChatGPT does not access live market data unless specifically integrated with external APIs (e.g., TradingView, CoinMarketCap or exchange websockets). Instructions must be clear and unambiguous; ChatGPT may misinterpret vague or complex commands. Improperly secured API keys or lack of two-factor authentication (2FA) can expose trading accounts to unauthorized access. ChatGPT’s cloud-based infrastructure can introduce latency, which could impact performance during highly volatile periods. ChatGPT does not monitor regional compliance rules; users must manually enforce trading limits based on local regulations. Ethical and regulatory implications of AI in crypto trading As AI becomes more integrated into trading systems, it raises significant ethical and regulatory concerns that stakeholders across the financial sector are beginning to address. Accountability: If an AI agent executes a harmful or unlawful trade, questions arise around legal responsibility. It remains unclear in many jurisdictions whether liability falls primarily on the developer, the trader using the AI system or the platform facilitating the transactions. Market manipulation risks: Autonomous AI bots could unintentionally engage in activities such as spoofing (placing and canceling fake orders to mislead the market) or wash trading (creating artificial volume), especially if not properly programmed with compliance safeguards. Regulatory oversight: Financial authorities, including the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the European Securities and Markets Authority, are actively studying the implications of AI and algorithmic trading. These agencies have recognized that traditional trading regulations may not fully account for autonomous decision-making by AI systems. Policy developments: In January 2024, the European Commission released updates to its Digital Finance Strategy, which included references to AI-based financial services. While not yet finalized, these draft regulations under the broader Digital Finance Package signal a move toward stricter compliance expectations for firms deploying AI in financial markets. Meanwhile, ethical crypto platforms are beginning to voluntarily disclose the use of trading bots in their systems. In parallel, open-source communities are advocating for clearer audit trails, improved model transparency and the establishment of ethical guidelines for AI applications in finance to ensure accountability and fairness.

But this time, something feels different. While Cardano price prediction experts remain hopeful, a growing number of analysts are shifting their focus to a rising star with jaw-dropping potential: Bitcoin Solaris. It’s not just another altcoin—it’s being positioned as the crypto most likely to repeat Bitcoin’s historic millionaire-making trajectory. What About Cardano? Cardano has long been celebrated for its academic roots and slow-but-steady development strategy. Its strong fundamentals and loyal community make it a solid hold, but not necessarily the most explosive opportunity. While ADA continues to show stability, it’s missing one thing: early-stage investor advantage. That’s where Bitcoin Solaris steps in. Universal Mining: Everyone Can Now Earn Crypto One of Bitcoin Solaris’s greatest breakthroughs lies in its Universal Mining model. Traditional mining was once reserved for experts with deep pockets and advanced rigs. But now, even a basic smartphone or laptop can mine BTC-S effortlessly. Mine with any device: No ASICs needed—just your phone, tablet, or PC. Tap-and-earn: One-click mining via the upcoming Solaris Nova App. Adaptive algorithm: Tailors mining output to your hardware automatically. Energy-efficient: Uses 99.95% less power than conventional mining. Built-in wallet: Store your BTC-S directly inside the app. Global reach: If you have internet, you can mine. While only some community members currently have access to the Solaris Nova App beta, there’s still time to join before the official release. This frictionless approach to mining is what makes Bitcoin Solaris stand out—it’s simple, scalable, and perfect for the masses. Presale Traction: Bitcoin Solaris Gains Momentum Current Price: $4 Next Phase: $5 Launch Price: $20 Bonus: 12% Beyond the numbers, the momentum is real. With over $1.2 million raised and just 90 days to run, the Bitcoin Solaris presale is shaping up to be one of the most explosive early-stage launches of the year. More than 8,900 users have already joined ahead of the July 31, 2025 launch, locking in their spot before prices surge. Why Work for Money When BTC-S Can Work for You? To ensure investor trust, Bitcoin Solaris backs its growth with strong security credentials: Fully audited by Cyberscope Fully audited by Freshcoins Verified KYC compliance In a market full of uncertainty, BTC-S is proving it’s built on transparency—not hype. Analysts and Influencers Join the Chorus As more experts take notice, Bitcoin Solaris is quickly gaining visibility. Influencer reviews are starting to flood in, with Crypto Nitro calling it one of the most exciting mobile mining plays to date. These aren’t just empty endorsements—analysts are highlighting real utility, real momentum, and an engaged, expanding community. And speaking of community, Bitcoin Solaris has built a loyal presence across platforms. The Telegram channel and X page are where early supporters gather, share updates, and track the presale’s surge in real time. For anyone looking to stay ahead of the curve, those platforms are essential. Referral Program: Double the Rewards To fuel its organic growth, Bitcoin Solaris has introduced a double rewards referral program. When you refer someone, you earn 5% in BTC-S tokens, and they get a 5% token bonus on their purchase. It’s a win-win model that incentivizes the kind of viral expansion seen in early Bitcoin days—only this time, it’s structured and trackable via each user’s dashboard. Final Thoughts: This Might Be Your Moment The truth is, very few altcoins ever present a chance this big. Bitcoin Solaris is combining universal mining, mass adoption tools, and presale momentum in a way that feels eerily familiar to Bitcoin’s early years. But unlike Bitcoin, this time you know what’s possible.

2025-05-22T10:04:17.000Z,"XRP Forms First-Ever Golden Cross Against Bitcoin. Here’s the Significance","XRP has recorded a key technical milestone by forming its first-ever golden cross against Bitcoin on the weekly timeframe, a development that analysts are viewing as a strong indicator of long-term strength. This event occurs as XRP continues to display growing momentum both on-chain and in market activity, despite years of subdued performance due to regulatory overhang. A golden cross is defined in technical analysis as the point at which a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average, typically interpreted as a potential shift from a bearish to a bullish trend. In this instance, XRP’s 50-week moving average has moved above the 200-week moving average against Bitcoin. It’s the first time this crossover has occurred for the XRP/BTC trading pair, and it suggests a possible reversal in the relative underperformance XRP has experienced since late 2020. Potential Implications for XRP Price Performance This formation is attracting attention because it follows nearly four years of sideways movement in the XRP/BTC ratio, a period during which XRP was largely unable to capitalize on broader market rallies due to its legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Now, with more clarity surrounding Ripple’s position and increasing on-chain activity, the market is reassessing XRP’s relative valuation. Some market participants see this technical shift as a sign that XRP may outperform Bitcoin in the coming months, particularly as altcoin markets gradually recover and investors begin rotating capital outside Bitcoin. The move is seen as particularly notable because most altcoins are still trailing Bitcoin in terms of year-to-date performance. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP Ledger Sees Strong Q1 2025 Growth Accompanying this technical signal is data indicating significant growth in XRP’s network activity. According to Messari’s “State of XRP Ledger Q1 2025” report, XRP’s circulating market capitalization rose by 2% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ), contrasting with a combined 22% decline across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. On a year-over-year (YoY) basis, XRP’s market cap surged by 252%, growing from $34.6 billion at the end of Q1 2024. Other key metrics also reflected sustained momentum. Daily active addresses increased by 142% QoQ to reach 134,600. The number of new addresses rose by 12% from the previous quarter, totaling 568,300, a 210% increase from the same period a year ago. Notably, the number of receiver addresses on the XRP Ledger continued to exceed sender addresses for the fourth consecutive quarter, signaling an expanding base of transaction participants. Daily average receiver addresses climbed by 168% to 127,800, while average daily senders grew by 14.5%, reaching 34,300. XRP’s first-ever golden cross against Bitcoin on the weekly chart, coupled with positive growth across its core network metrics, may mark a turning point in its long-term trajectory. As technical indicators and adoption metrics align, investor sentiment toward XRP appears to be improving, potentially positioning the asset for stronger relative performance in the broader crypto market.

2025-05-22T10:02:14.000Z,"Crypto travelers bring 3x greater lifetime value than fiat users","Travelers using cryptocurrency for booking arrangements spend more than twice as much as regular travelers using fiat money, according to a joint report from Binance Pay and crypto travel platform Travala shared with Cointelegraph. Crypto-based bookings on Travala reached $80 million in 2024, up from $45 million the year before. Crypto travelers are also outspending their fiat counterparts, with an average booking value of $1,211 per transaction, over 2.5 times more than fiat users who spend $469. Additionally, the report said crypto users were three times more valuable over their lifetime due to longer stays and higher repeat bookings, with crypto travelers 57% more likely to make a repeat hotel purchase. Source: Binance Pay, Travala Juan Otero, CEO of Travala, attributed these travel preferences to the flexible nature of Web3 jobs: “Many also work in the digital asset industry or have flexible, remote work lifestyles, which makes them more likely to travel frequently and stay in one place for longer while seeking out destinations that support seamless, global payments.” Crypto-based transactions have become more common in the travel sector and beyond. Airlines that have integrated digital currencies into their booking systems have seen a 40% boost in bookings, with travel and hospitality representing 14% of all crypto transactions in 2024, according to a Feb. 21 report by Triple-A . Related: Crypto spending will grow, but fiat isn’t going anywhere: Mercuryo CEO The main benefit of using crypto for travel is its borderless, global utility, Jonathan Lim, the global head of Binance Pay, told Cointelegraph. “Travelers can skip currency exchange lines, avoid foreign transaction fees, and pay instantly using assets they already hold,” he added. A growing number of crypto users also drives the increase in travelers using crypto to pay for trips. Triple-A’s report shows that cryptocurrency ownership has a compound annual growth rate of 99%, significantly outpacing the growth of traditional payment methods. Among crypto owners, 65% express interest in using it for payments. Founded in 2017, Travala is among the most popular crypto-native travel platforms, which enables users to pay for services like flights, hotel stays and tours with 141 different cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin ( BTC ) and USDC ( USDC ) via Binance Pay. Related: Bhutan launches tourism crypto payments with Binance Pay and DK Bank Crypto payment covers more and more retail industries The first real-world Bitcoin transaction — 10,000 BTC for two pizzas — occurred 15 years ago today, on May 22, 2010, now commemorated as Bitcoin Pizza Day. Since then, crypto payments have expanded into high-end retail, luxury goods and more recently, fast food. First real-world purchase using BTC Source: bitcointalk.org The first retail businesses to accept cryptocurrency payments were primarily targeted at high-income consumers. In 2021, fashion brand Philipp Plein became one of the pioneers in accepting crypto, followed by Gucci , luxury watchmakers Franck Muller and Norgain , as well as high-end car dealerships and manufacturers. As the crypto holder base expands, more retailers are beginning to accept digital currencies for everyday transactions. On May 16, American fast food outlet Steak’n Shake began to accept Bitcoin as payment. Yet even with the Lightning Network implementation, a Steak’n Shake customer revealed that a $5 burger could cost over $8 with network fees and take over 20 minutes to confirm payment. Related: Bitcoin accepted at fast food chain Steak ’n Shake from May 16 With Binance Pay, payments are confirmed within seconds. Lim told Cointelegraph that’s because “Binance Pay operates as an offchain, closed-loop payment solution within the Binance ecosystem.” Still, most crypto travel payments on Travala are made using stablecoins like Tether’s USDt ( USDT ) and Circle’s USDC ( USDC ). Binance Pay transactions are ultimately converted into fiat at the point of sale by the merchant or payment partner based on a predetermined exchange rate.

2025-05-22T10:02:14.000Z,"Berkshire Hathaway in danger as Japanese bonds crash, but Warren Buffett still won’t touch Bitcoin that’s making new ATHs","Berkshire Hathaway is in deep trouble as Japan’s bond market unravels, and Warren Buffett refuses to even glance at Bitcoin, which just crossed a record-breaking $111,000. The current historic surge in Japanese bond yields is threatening to blow up the exact strategy Warren used to justify his billion-dollar bets on Japan’s five major trading houses. While global investors are flooding into crypto and banking record profits, Warren is doing the exact opposite—selling off his only crypto exposure and doubling down on a play that’s now bleeding from all sides. Warren raised ¥281.8 billion in October 2024, then followed up with a much smaller ¥90 billion in April 2025 through yen-denominated bonds. Those funds were used to build positions close to 10% in Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Itochu, Marubeni, and Sumitomo. It worked at first. Borrow at 0.5% interest, buy stocks paying ~5% in dividends. Easy cash. But now, as Japan’s bond yields rise fast, that carry trade strategy is getting torched. New bond issues cost more. The interest spread shrinks. The profit vanishes. Japanese stocks drop as yields kill equity valuations Shares of the five trading houses aren’t holding up either. In 2025 alone, Mitsui’s down 20%, Itochu has lost 16%, and the rest are sliding. Higher yields usually signal tighter policy, and tighter policy kills equity valuations—especially ones built on stable dividends. Berkshire’s portfolio in Japan is loaded with those. The damage gets worse when you factor in the trade tensions triggered by Donald Trump’s latest tariffs, which rattled Japanese markets earlier this year and forced companies like Asahi and Suntory to walk away from bond deals completely. Berkshire didn’t back out, but the ¥90 billion bond it issued this April was the company’s smallest ever. That’s not a flex. That’s caution. The situation’s turning so fast that the same assets Warren called “long-term holdings” are now dipping below what he paid. And while he’s always claimed to like cheap stocks, these ones might get cheaper than he’s willing to admit. Currency swings and bond pressure weaken Berkshire’s hedge There’s another issue Berkshire can’t dodge: the yen. The company’s bonds and dividends are all yen-based, which was supposed to act as a hedge. If the yen dropped, Berkshire’s debt would be easier to repay. That hedge only works when the yen stays weak. But in July 2024, when the Bank of Japan surprised markets with a rate hike, the yen got stronger, fast. If yields keep going up, the yen could climb again. That turns the hedge against Warren. It slashes the dollar value of dividends, hurts returns, and messes with the company’s ability to balance its foreign books. Still, despite the rising risks, Warren’s been stubborn. He hasn’t sold his Japanese positions. He hasn’t moved away from the bond strategy. And he sure ain’t touching Bitcoin, which just set back-to-back all-time highs this week. That’s after Berkshire dumped its entire stake in Nu Holdings, the Brazilian fintech firm behind crypto-friendly Nubank. Bitcoin explodes after Warren exits Nubank and ditches crypto Warren’s firm closed out of Nubank in Q1 2025, walking away with $250 million in profit. That move officially ended Berkshire’s one and only link to crypto. While Warren was cashing out, Bitcoin surged to $109,800, then jumped again to $111,762 on Wednesday, fueled by renewed institutional interest and support for the GENIUS Act in the Senate. That bill lays out new rules for stablecoins and has been a major boost for confidence in the space. Traders also took advantage of the momentum, with over $900 million in short positions liquidated, based on data from CoinGlass. Ethereum, XRP, and Solana all followed Bitcoin’s lead, climbing as the crypto market roared. Meanwhile, Berkshire boosted its cash pile to $347.8 billion, mostly held in US Treasurys, after also unloading shares of Citigroup and Bank of America. Warren once called Bitcoin “rat poison squared,” and it doesn’t look like his opinion has evolved. Despite the rally, despite the regulation, despite even Jamie Dimon, longtime Bitcoin skeptic and JPMorgan CEO, telling clients they can now buy the coin through the bank, Warren hasn’t budged. At Berkshire’s latest shareholder meeting, an attendee named Jackie Han asked about the company’s take on real estate. Warren laughed and said if he had to pick between real estate and stocks for life, he’d go with stocks every time. “There’s just so much more opportunity, at least in the United States, that presents itself in the security market than in real estate,” Warren said.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/berkshire-hathaway-in-danger-as-bonds-crash/,"ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET","OP-ED|Berkshire Hathaway|BoJ|BTC|JPY|USD",cryptocompare

Some of them are gearing up to trigger a strong breakout, but the XRP price appears to remain restrained from the ongoing bullish trend. The price is closely consolidating below the pivotal resistance, which could point towards a breakout, but careful observation hints that the price rally could be restrictive, as suggested by a couple of on-chain data points. The XRP price had been tightly consolidating below $1 for over a couple of years and triggered a massive breakout during Q4 2024. This was when the bulls, retail traders and whales all together pushed the price above $2. Since then, the price has remained consolidated between $2 and $3, failing to keep up with the growing market trends. The massive drop in the active addresses hints towards a sudden decrease in the users’ participation. The drop in the active address hints towards a decrease in the number of traders contacting the network to perform a trade. This also indicates a drop in the volatility, which has kept the levels consolidated and prevented a breakout. On the other hand, Open Interest has also plunged, which was in recovery mode. This suggests the traders are closing the futures positions either to take profits, cut losses or adjust their overall portfolio exposure. Moreover, some on-chain reports suggest the whales have off-loaded over 60 million XRP in the last 72 hours, which raises concern over the short-term price action. Will XRP Price Fail to Reach $3? The XRP price is closely consolidating but the token is accumulating gains between the range of 2018 and 2021 highs. Moreover, it has formed a massive bull flag and hence a breakout from the resistance could push the price into the discovery phase. The rebound from the lows has not triggered a rebound with the RSI levels, which remain consolidated along the average range. This suggests the rally remains within a decisive phase and hence a rise in the RSI could eventually push the XRP price beyond the consolidated range; else a drop could drag the levels to the support close to $2 or slightly lower.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/altcoins-are-about-to-surge-dramatically-why-is-xrp-price-failing-to-go-parabolic/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

As gold and cash ETFs slip down, the leaderboard is slowly turning back into 2024. pic.twitter.com/pyosSuuptU — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) May 21, 2025 IBIT has attracted nearly $8.9 billion in net inflows, placing it ahead of long-established funds and signaling strong institutional appetite for crypto exposure. Bitcoin ETFs overall have reached a historic milestone, with total cumulative inflows surpassing $40 billion as of May 2025. Much of that growth has come from institutional investors seeking regulated, liquid, and tax-efficient exposure to Bitcoin, particularly via spot ETFs like BlackRock’s. For many large asset managers, pension funds, and sovereign institutions, ETFs remain the most practical or even the only route to gain exposure to Bitcoin, due to internal compliance restrictions or regulatory mandates. This trend is shifting the Bitcoin ownership structure itself: an increasing share of circulating BTC is being absorbed by ETF issuers, further centralizing holdings among a few major financial players. Notably, the growing institutional presence is contributing to Bitcoin’s evolving narrative from speculative asset to macro hedge and strategic reserve. With Bitcoin currently trading above $100,000, BlackRock’s position represents a powerful vote of confidence in crypto’s long-term viability.

2025-05-22T09:54:12.000Z,"Why the Crypto Market Is Up Today? Bitcoin Hits $112K, Ethereum Price Jumps 5.5%","The post Why the Crypto Market Is Up Today? Bitcoin Hits $112K, Ethereum Price Jumps 5.5% appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is buzzing with excitement as Bitcoin smashed through the $110,000 mark for the first time, pushing even higher toward $112,000 in early trading. Ether joined the rally, jumping 5.5%, as optimism spreads across the crypto market. The overall sentiment is clearly bullish, with rising institutional interest , regulatory progress, and geopolitical uncertainty acting as fuel for this impressive rally. Meanwhile, global markets, especially in Asia, are feeling the pressure from rising US bond yields and political risks, keeping all eyes on Washington as key economic data rolls in. Crypto Market 24H Overview! $BTC is on a strong rally, trading at $110,707.60 with solid daily growth of +3.72% $ETH is holding steady at $2,616.98, gaining +2.23% and slowly increasing its market dominance. pic.twitter.com/7ERU6d1d4o — Crypto.Andy (@oksandy_d) May 22, 2025 Bitcoin Bull Run : BTC Price Bounces Back Strong Bitcoin has surged over 30% from its April low near $74,000, which came right after Trump’s “ Liberation Day” tariff announcement . The recent rebound gained momentum following a May 12 U.S.-China trade deal that paused most tariffs for 90 days. Meanwhile, poor U.S. bond auctions and falling stock indexes pushed investors toward alternative assets like Bitcoin, reinforcing its role as a hedge. According to Santiment , Bitcoin reached a fresh milestone at $109,500, beating its previous high set on Trump’s inauguration day. Institutional players like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark Invest have poured billions into BTC, with BlackRock’s spot ETF IBIT now holding over $20B. Because many retail traders remained cautious, the market avoided excessive hype, giving Bitcoin a clean runway to soar. Santiment also warned that the brief surge in FOMO around $109.5K might cause a short-term dip. However, if the excitement cools quickly, Bitcoin could still aim for $115K–$120K soon. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : What is Bitcoin Pizza Day? Two Papa John’s Pizzas, 10,000 BTC, and a Billion-Dollar Lesson , Why is Bitcoin Price Up Today? BTC Markets CEO Caroline Bowler says the rally is being driven by better infrastructure for institutions and improving regulatory clarity. That’s reflected in major legislative moves like the GENIUS Act , which just passed a procedural vote in the U.S. Senate. The bill sets clear rules for stablecoins, helping legitimize them in the eyes of big investors. Andrei Grachev from DWF Labs called it a turning point, noting it could help stablecoins move from being a crypto “experiment” to a global standard for digital money. Texas Takes a Bold Step Meanwhile, Texas is making headlines with the passage of SB 21, a bill to create a state-managed Bitcoin reserve. It passed the Texas House in a strong 101–42 vote and is now waiting for Governor Abbott’s signature. With a GDP of $2.7 trillion, Texas could soon become the second U.S. state, after New Hampshire, to officially hold Bitcoin as a strategic asset, an idea that once seemed radical but now feels forward-thinking. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

SOL/USDT up against major resistance barrier Source: TradingView For the SOL/USDT pair, it can be seen that the $SOL price is now right up against the first of a band of very strong resistances. With the Stochastic RSI indicators on the weekly approaching the top of their trajectory, $SOL bulls have to take this chance to pierce through this daunting barrier. If they can do so, the next target would be the $202 resistance. What $SOL bulls want, isn’t for the Stochastic RSI indicators to just cross over and turn down, but to stay at the top for an extended period of time, just as was the case for a 7-week period in Q4 of 2023. Price momentum soon to pass from $ETH to $SOL Source: TradingView Against $ETH (SOL/ETH) the $SOL price has been under the cosh for the last month, as $ETH went into an extended surge against USDT. That said, if one looks at the SOL/ETH chart it can be noted that this was likely just a corrective impulse. As long as $SOL can stay above the ascending trendline, and the strong support levels below, the tables could start to turn in $SOL’s favour soon. The Stochastic RSI in the weekly time frame has the indicators still heading downward, but they could hit bottom in the next couple of weeks or so, and then turn back up to pass price momentum back to $SOL. $SOL has much to do against $BTC Source: TradingView Against its $BTC pair (SOL/BTC), $SOL has a lot to do. After falling out of the big triangle SOL/BTC found itself below two major horizontal resistance levels. $SOL is battling against the first one without success so far, and time is running short with the Stochastic RSI indicators starting to approach the top. If $SOL could break the resistances, get back into the triangle, and break out of the top, this would be a wondrous sequence of events for the $SOL bulls. As it stands, this is not looking likely. Huge price momentum needs to come in for $SOL and it needs to arrive soon. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-05-22T09:51:44.000Z,"Crypto ownership falls sharply in Singapore as half of holders sell in 2024, data shows","A growing number of Singaporeans exited the crypto market in 2024, with ownership falling 11% and 50% of holders selling their assets. Many crypto investors in Singapore are locking in gains and rebalancing their portfolios instead of jumping into the recent market rally, according to the 2025 Independent Reserve Cryptocurrency Index. The survey found that 49% of Singaporean crypto investors had sold part or all of their holdings in the past year, and of those, 67% had made a profit. Lasanka Perera, CEO of Independent Reserve Singapore, said the data from this year’s IRCI indicated not a retreat from crypto “but a recalibration.” Crypto ownership dropped to 29% from 40% in 2024, despite rising awareness and prices. Still, Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) remain the most held assets, at 68% and 48%, respectively. Investors appear more selective, with 65% holding only two to five cryptocurrencies. “Singaporeans now have a more thoughtful, disciplined approach to investing in crypto. They have been making smart plays and know that being in the right asset class matters. It’s been exciting to witness the market becoming more informed and mature when it comes to digital assets.” Lasanka Perera You might also like: Franklin Templeton gets regulatory approval to launch a tokenized fund in Singapore One in five Singaporeans invests in crypto, compared to nearly half in stocks or fixed deposits, the data shows. The shift comes amid global uncertainty and a rising preference for safer options. Many are putting more money in savings, with 49% favoring cash or fixed deposits, up from 42% last year. Confidence among existing crypto holders still remains strong. Over half — around 53% — said they are likely to buy more within the next 12 months. At the same time, public awareness reached 94%, though trust still depends on stronger rules and company conduct, per the survey. In early April, a survey by crypto payment firm Triple-A found that more than half of Singapore holders are using digital assets for payments. Among these holders, around 52% said they have used crypto to pay for goods and services, while 67% said they plan to use it more often in future.

2025-05-22T09:48:38.000Z,"Pakistan sets up Digital Assets Authority to oversee crypto regulation","Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance confirmed the creation of the Pakistan Digital Assets Authority to regulate the country’s blockchain and cryptocurrency sector. According to a May 21 report from state-owned broadcaster PTV, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the move is part of a broader push to modernise Pakistan’s financial system and position the country as a serious player in the digital economy. What is the Pakistan Digital Assets Authority? The Pakistan Digital Assets Authority (PDAA) is a newly approved regulatory body that will oversee the country’s blockchain-based financial infrastructure and digital asset ecosystem. Its mandate includes licensing, compliance, and innovation across platforms dealing with crypto and tokenized services . The PDAA will supervise entities such as cryptocurrency exchanges, custodians, digital wallets, stablecoins, and decentralised finance (DeFi) protocols, and is designed to streamline oversight under a single, agile framework tailored for digital finance. Beyond regulation, the authority is expected to play a key role in tokenizing national assets and government debt. Officials say this could open new channels for economic participation and transparency. The agency will also focus on monetising Pakistan’s surplus electricity through regulated Bitcoin mining. Regulators have already begun talks with various industry stakeholders to explore competitive energy pricing for the sector without subsidies. Among other duties, the PDAA will support Web3 startups and developers by providing legal clarity and an innovation-friendly environment. With over 60% of Pakistan’s population under 30, the country’s youth-driven tech-savvy talent is seen as a strategic advantage. According to Finance Minister Aurangzeb, the PDAA is central to Pakistan’s strategy, which seeks to balance innovation with consumer protection. “Pakistan must regulate not just to catch up — but to lead,” he said, adding that the goal is to invite global investment while ensuring FATF-compliant oversight. Pakistan softens crypto stance Under the previous administration, Pakistan took a hardline approach to crypto. In 2023, then Finance Minister Aisha Ghaus Pasha made it clear that the country had no intention of legalising digital assets, citing FATF concerns and the risks of regulatory evasion. Meanwhile, regulatory bodies like the State Bank of Pakistan reinforced that stance, repeatedly warning against crypto use and classifying assets like Bitcoin as illegal tender. But over time, that rigid stance began to soften , as grassroots-level adoption grew and policymakers started to explore the sector’s potential. By late 2024, the government proposed key amendments to the SBP Act to allow the central bank to issue digital currency and manage both physical and digital money. It was one of the first real signs that the country was preparing to embrace digital finance in a more structured way. That momentum continued into 2025 with the formation of the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC), an advisory body launched under the Finance Division to guide policy on digital assets. The PDAA was among the key recommendations put forward by the council. Led by Web3 advocate Bilal Bin Saqib, the PCC has been vocal about the country’s potential to become a hub for blockchain innovation. Commenting on the recent development, Saqib said the effort goes beyond just crypto, framing it as a broader push to reshape Pakistan’s financial future by “expanding access, and creating new export channels through tokenization, digital finance and Web3 innovation.” The post Pakistan sets up Digital Assets Authority to oversee crypto regulation appeared first on Invezz",invezz,https://invezz.com/news/2025/05/22/pakistan-sets-up-digital-assets-authority-to-oversee-crypto-regulation/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MINING|REGULATION","Crypto|Crypto regulation|Crypto wallets|Pakistan|Stablecoin",cryptocompare

2025-05-22T09:47:20.000Z,"Veteran trader predicts Bitcoin price for August 2025","Veteran trader Peter Brandt has projected that with Bitcoin ( BTC ) hitting a new all-time high, the asset’s technical setup is likely positioning it for a rally of up to 35% in August. Brandt, who boasts over four decades of trading experience, suggested that the current formation could see the leading cryptocurrency trading at $125,000, or even $150,000, this August, according to his X post on May 21. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: Peter Brandt His analysis highlighted Bitcoin’s breakout from a bull flag pattern after retesting the $102,400 level. The asset also recently confirmed an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout on the weekly chart, strengthening the long-term bullish case. Previous consolidation patterns, like a symmetrical triangle and double-top retest, have also resolved upward. With a steady trend of higher highs and higher lows, Bitcoin has entered record territory, which Brandt sees as a natural progression in an ongoing bull cycle rather than isolated technical events. Bitcoin golden cross formation Other technical indicators support Bitcoin’s potential surge to new highs, adding to the bullish outlook. Notably, the digital currency is approaching its first golden cross since October, a technical event in which the 50-day moving average ( MA ) crosses above the 200-day MA. Historically, this pattern has signaled the beginning of powerful uptrends for Bitcoin. To illustrate, the last time a golden cross formed, BTC surged 46% in just two months. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: Barchart Overall, Bitcoin’s current rally is driven by strong positive momentum in the broader market, growing optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and rising institutional interest. Despite declining U.S. stock markets, this latest uptrend has emerged, marking a rare divergence from Bitcoin’s typical correlation with equities. Bitcoin price analysis As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $110,900, gaining nearly 4% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly timeframe, the asset has posted gains of over 7%.

However, despite the overall bullish sentiment, the 14-day relative strength index ( RSI ) stands at 74.89, indicating overbought conditions and a possible short-term correction.

2025-05-22T09:46:28.000Z,"Michigan House receives four new pro-crypto bills to clarify Bitcoin holding, mining, taxation","On May 21, 2025, the Michigan House introduced four new crypto-related bills aimed at clarifying and promoting the use of Bitcoin and other digital assets in the American state. The bills were introduced in the Michigan House late Wednesday, joining a growing trend of state-level efforts to define the role of digital assets in public policy and economic frameworks. Michigan House to consider four new crypto-related bills One of them is Rep. Bill Schuette’s (R-MI) House Bill 4510, which seeks to allow Michigan’s state treasurer to invest retirement funds in crypto, as long as they averaged a market cap of at least $250 billion over the previous year and are held via exchange-traded products. The Michigan House introduced four new bills to clarify and promote Bitcoin in the state. Source: Bitcoin Laws The $250 billion threshold effectively limits the eligibility to Bitcoin, which has set a new all-time high amid renewed institutional interest. Assets will have to be held through exchange-traded products issued by registered investment firms, ensuring regulatory oversight, according to HB 4510. The next bill, House Bill 4511, was introduced by Rep. Bryan Posthumus (R-MI), and focuses on the federal government’s push for central bank digital currencies. The bill proposes a state-level ban on any licensing, taxation, or restriction of digital asset holdings and prohibits state agencies from advocating for a U.S. CBDC. The other two bills were both introduced by Rep. Mike McFall (D-MI) as companion bills, HB 4512 and HB 4513, focused on Bitcoin mining and tax reform. One seeks the establishment of a “Bitcoin Program” that will allow private firms to plug abandoned oil or gas wells in exchange for temporary rights to mine Bitcoin using residual fuel sources. The other offer links crypto directly to remediation efforts as it affects income and corporate tax deductions for revenue earned through such mining efforts. If approved, the program would be administered by the state’s Supervisor of Wells, who would maintain a public registry of eligible well sites, solicit annual bids, and ensure that participating miners carry financial responsibility for site restoration. Michigan’s legislative push occurs as several U.S. states race to either welcome or restrict crypto adoption. American states are warming up to cryptocurrency ideals The four new bills are proof that Michigan is on the pro-crypto side, making similar legislative efforts as states like New Hampshire, Arizona, and Kentucky, where laws have been passed or proposed to legalize Bitcoin reserves, protect self-custody rights, or incentivize crypto mining. For example, New Hampshire became the first state to approve a Bitcoin reserve in 2025. Kentucky’s 2025 Blockchain Digital Asset Act legalized crypto mining with incentives. Also, some hours earlier, the Texas House passed a bill to create a state-managed Bitcoin reserve and sent it to Governor Greg Abbott’s desk. According to reports, the bill would allow the state comptroller to invest in any digital asset with a market cap above $500 billion, a criterion that only Bitcoin matches at the moment. New Hampshire Governor Kelly Ayotte also signed a similar bill into law earlier this month, confirming her state as the first in the country to formally authorize crypto and precious metal investments for public funds. The new Michigan bills are a step in the right direction, but even though they’ve been introduced, these bills have a long way to go before they become law. They have to pass through committee reviews, House votes, Senate approval, and the governor’s signature. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for bills to be rejected. States, like Florida and Pennsylvania, have seen similar crypto-oriented bills fail to garner enough support.

TICKER: XRPI pic.twitter.com/hukzoHtOWf — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) May 21, 2025 With the launch scheduled for today, market participants across the cryptocurrency landscape, particularly within the XRP community, are closely watching for its potential impact. The ETF marks a significant milestone not only for XRP but also for the broader evolution of regulated crypto investment products in the United States. XRPI Launch Marks Regulatory Progress for XRP Volatility Shares, an asset management firm previously known for launching leveraged Bitcoin futures ETFs, is now venturing into the XRP ecosystem by offering institutional and retail investors indirect exposure to XRP through a futures-based financial product. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Unlike spot ETFs, which require the issuer to hold the underlying asset, a futures ETF tracks the price of XRP through futures contracts listed on regulated exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) . This structure allows traditional investors to gain exposure to XRP price movements without holding the asset directly. The product’s approval and listing come at a time when market sentiment surrounding XRP is showing signs of renewed optimism. Following a pivotal court ruling in the SEC v. Ripple case that clarified XRP is not a security in secondary market transactions, the digital asset has regained favor among institutional players and high-profile investors. The timing of the XRPI launch is expected to capitalize on this momentum, offering a regulated gateway for capital inflow into XRP derivatives. Market watchers are now turning their attention to XRPl’s performance on its first day of trading. Volume, investor interest, and initial pricing behavior will be closely monitored as indicators of institutional sentiment towards the recent development.

2025-05-22T09:23:04.000Z,"While BTC consolidates, MUTM climbs toward its first major price jump","As Bitcoin (BTC) holds steady just above the $100,000 level, overall momentum across the crypto market has started to cool. BTC’s price action has entered a consolidation phase, with traders waiting for a clear breakout or correction. But while many eyes remain fixed on Bitcoin’s next move, some investors are already looking elsewhere — and that’s where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) comes in. Far from stalling, MUTM has been steadily building momentum in the background. The token is still priced at $0.03, but with growing traction in its presale and clear signs of rising interest, its first major price breakout is likely not far off. For those searching for the best crypto to buy now before the next wave of retail attention, MUTM is beginning to look like a standout pick. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) What sets Mutuum Finance apart from the usual lineup of early-stage cryptocurrencies is its steady delivery on promises. Rather than relying on hype-driven marketing cycles, the project has focused on building real infrastructure — and it shows. At its foundation, Mutuum operates as a decentralized protocol for lending and borrowing, featuring two separate models. In the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system, users deposit digital assets into shared liquidity pools, earning yield that adjusts dynamically based on pool utilization. For passive income seekers, this model offers a hands-off way to generate returns while contributing to the protocol’s liquidity layer. In contrast, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model enables users to set and agree on loan terms through direct negotiation. This approach is particularly beneficial for trading tokens that don’t typically appear in traditional lending environments — including memecoins or high-volatility assets. With P2P, users gain flexibility that’s hard to find elsewhere, making it especially appealing to those with niche strategies or less mainstream tokens. In addition to its lending features, Mutuum offers mtTokens — interest-generating tokens minted at a 1:1 ratio to user deposits. These tokens automatically increase in redeemable value over time as interest is collected across the platform. Unlike fixed staking setups, mtTokens stay completely liquid and transferable, allowing users to manage their assets freely while still earning yield. Adding another layer of depth is Mutuum’s upcoming stablecoin, which is being designed as an overcollateralized, decentralized asset. Minted directly from excess collateral supplied through the protocol, this dollar-pegged token will serve as a reliable unit of account for users who want to borrow against their holdings without leaving the platform. With the supply adjusted dynamically and transparently through smart contracts, it offers an alternative to centralized stablecoins — and brings meaningful utility to the protocol’s economy. This blend of features — layered yield, customizable lending, and an integrated stablecoin — makes Mutuum Finance more than just a presale token. It places the project as a full-scale DeFi ecosystem, prepared to go live with practical applications from the very start. A presale that’s attracting major attention With these utilities in place and a product launch timed with the token listing, it’s no surprise that investor interest is building. The ongoing presale has already brought in nearly $9 million, with the community now exceeding 11,000 holders — a rare milestone for a token that hasn’t even launched yet. What’s more telling is the quality of interest. Several notable crypto investors — including those previously active in top-tier DeFi projects — are now shifting part of their focus to MUTM. The combination of a low entry price and real utility is proving to be a compelling mix, especially for those seeking the next big crypto with high-growth potential. While Bitcoin takes a breather, tokens like MUTM are being positioned by early buyers for potentially massive upside. With a strong foundation already in place and several mechanics designed to reward long-term holders, Mutuum Finance is now preparing for what could be its first major price jump — one that may not wait until listing day to begin. And at $0.03, the token still qualifies as one of the best cheap cryptos to buy now. But based on the momentum it’s gaining and the tools it’s offering, that label may not stick for long. In addition to everything already outlined, Mutuum is also giving early participants another reason to act. The project is currently running a $100,000 promotional campaign, with details available through the official platform channels. Ten winners will be selected, each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM — an added incentive for those stepping in before the presale progresses further. For investors who believe in utility-backed projects, scalable platforms, and entry prices with serious upside, MUTM continues to check all the right boxes. And while Bitcoin consolidates, it’s becoming clear that Mutuum Finance is quietly making its move — and smart money is paying attention.

Using $28.4 million in margin spread across several trades, Wynn entered Bitcoin at an average price of $108,065. The bold move came close to a $16.3 million loss before the price surged past $110,000 on May 21, pushing the position safely above the liquidation level of $103,790. Early May 22 trading saw Bitcoin near $112,000, further securing the position. Wynn had started reducing some exposure when Bitcoin hovered around $106,000 on May 20, as noted by HyperDash data. Still, the majority of the long position remained active as prices climbed.

Many altcoins have posted even more impressive gains over the past day, led by HYPE’s meteoric rise beyond $30. BTC’s New ATH BTC broke above $100,000 on May 8 and has maintained within a six-digit price territory ever since.

The past weekend saw another surge toward the upper boundary, which was initially stopped by the bears. More volatility ensued as the business week progressed. In short, BTC pumped to $107,000 on a couple of occasions, but each rejection pushed it south by several grand. That was until yesterday, when the bulls took complete control of the market, pushed beyond that resistance, and finally helped the primary cryptocurrency break its January all-time high of around $109,100 and set a new one at almost $110,000.

Well, there’s a headline you didn’t expect this week. But that’s the claim from David Sacks, the White House’s top advisor on crypto and AI under the Trump administration. And if he’s right, America’s debt market might be on the verge of a huge shift. Speaking to CNBC , Sacks said that regulatory clarity for stablecoins could trigger “trillions of dollars of demand for our Treasuries practically overnight, very quickly.” Here’s why you need to pay attention. His statement is a bold forecast backed by the Trump administration’s renewed push for crypto legislation. Let’s unpack further. Why Is the GENIUS Act Important? At the heart of all this is the GENIUS Act – short for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins. If passed, it would finally give stablecoin issuers a proper federal framework and bring dollar-backed stablecoins under U.S. oversight. And momentum is clearly building. The bill just cleared a key hurdle in the Senate with a 66-32 vote, including support from 15 Democrats. Finally, some good news! According to Sacks, “There’s every expectation that the bill is going to pass.” Stablecoins: Unexpected Lifeline for U.S. Treasuries? Is this just regulation for the sake of control? Sacks framed the bill as a massive economic opportunity – a chance to modernize U.S. payment rails while also attracting enormous liquidity into Treasuries. Stablecoins, he said, offer “a new, more efficient, cheaper, smoother payment system.” That’s the sell, and it’s landing well – wouldn’t you agree? There’s already over $200 billion in stablecoins circulating, and without clear rules. With regulation, that capital could flow into U.S. Treasuries, potentially changing the outlook of government debt financing. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why the Crypto Market Is Up Today? Bitcoin Hits $112K, Ethereum Price Jumps 5.5% , But Wait – Here Come the Conflicts Not everyone’s buying the stablecoin-as-savior narrative.

It also pulled in a $2 billion investment from Abu Dhabi’s MGX fund – channeled through Binance, the same exchange that just admitted to violating U.S. anti-money laundering laws in a $4.3 billion plea deal. Yikes. Last-Minute Drama Could Slow Things Down Just as things were heating up, Sen. Josh Hawley dropped a last-minute amendment capping credit card late fees – something that could ruffle feathers in the banking world and slow things down. Still, the broader outlook is hard to ignore. If the GENIUS Act passes, this won’t just be a win for stablecoins. It could become a turning point in how the U.S. approaches digital dollars, debt markets, and its global economic leverage. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-22T09:00:43.000Z,"Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Realized $11.6 Billion In Profit Over Past Month: Report","A report from Glassnode has revealed how profit-taking from the Bitcoin short-term holders has noted a large uptick in the past month. Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Realized Profit Has Shot Up Recently In its latest weekly report, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the profit-taking spree from the Bitcoin short-term holders has looked recently. The “ short-term holders ” (STHs) refer to the BTC investors who bought their coins within the past 155 days. This part of the market is considered to include the fickle hands, who easily react to happenings related to the cryptocurrency. Given this, it’s only natural that the recent rally, which has now brought the asset to a brand new all-time high (ATH), would have also induced a reaction from this group. An indicator that can be useful to gauging the selling reaction related to rallies from this group is the “ Realized Profit .” This metric measures the total amount of profit that the STHs are ‘realizing’ through their transactions. The indicator works by going through the transfer history of each coin being sold by the members of the cohort to see what price they initially received it at. If this cost basis is less than the spot price that they are now selling at, then the coin’s sale is considered to be leading to the realization of some net profit. This profit is naturally equal to the difference between the two prices. The Realized Profit calculates this value for all profit transactions to find the total for the STHs as a whole. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm in the report that shows the trend in the Bitcoin STH Realized Profit over the last few months: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin STH Realized Profit has remained at elevated levels throughout the past month, indicating that the members of this cohort have predictably been participating in profit-taking. So far, the profit realization from the STHs has witnessed a peak of $747 million per day, which is quite substantial. In total, this cohort has harvested around $11.6 billion in gains since the start of the selloff. “For comparison, over the previous 30d period, only $1.2B of profit was realized, underscoring how drastic the rebound in new investor sentiment and spending behavior has been,” notes Glassnode. While this profit-taking spree has been large on its own, it has still been lower than the highs seen in late 2024. It now remains to be seen whether the Bitcoin STH Realized Profit would expand further in the coming days and if it does, whether incoming demand will be able to absorb the selling pressure.

In a broadcast message sent to his Investigations Telegram channel, on-chain investigator ZachXBT claimed to have received a message sent from a hacker accused of swindling more than $300 million worth of crypto assets from users. The message was sent to his on-chain Ethereum ( ETH ) account. “The threat actor who stole $300M+ from Coinbase users by paying customer support just began trolling me on-chain with this message,” said ZachXBT in his Telegram message. The message was sent from an address simply named Fake_Phishing1158790 and contained the words “L bozo” and what appeared to be a link to a YouTube video showing the viral internet short clip of former NBA athlete James Worthy smoking a cigar after a Lakers win. “Smoking that ZachXBT pack,” one user commented under the YouTube video, indicating they were led to the video after seeing the on-chain message addressed to the crypto sleuth.

The Coinbase user data exploit was first disclosed by the exchange on May 15. The hacker was believed to have bribed customer support staff to steal sensitive user data. According to Coinbase , the attacker was able to get ahold of phone names, addresses, phone numbers, government-issued IDs, and other account data. The exchange claimed that the exploit only affected less than 1% of users. After firing the customer service workers involved, the company estimated the breach could cost up to $400 million to resolve. The attackers had asked for a $20 million ransom from the crypto exchange. Coinbase refused to pay the $20 million ransom and is offering a bounty for anyone who can track down the attacker.

2025-05-22T08:55:08.000Z,"Bitcoin Headed for Smooth Landing Above $130,000, Expert Predicts","The largest cryptocurrency by market cap reclaimed the $100,000 price mark over a week ago and has managed to sustain momentum above that level. Interestingly, Bitcoin’s near-term price outlook remains bullish , as market experts have spotted key market patterns that further strengthen the leading asset’s already optimistic outlook. More recently, the pseudonymous analyst TradingShot shared a post to TradingView, a crypto data provider, in which he highlighted how “Bitcoin has unfolded a very interesting pattern since its April 07 bottom.” As the analyst asserted, since the asset’s bottom at $74,500, the big bull has continuously targeted all 10k intervals above it, from $74,000 to $84,000 and $94,000. Notably, the asset is now hovering around the $104,000 mark. Upon hitting the aforementioned price levels, Bitcoin witnessed a price consolidation, forming what the analyst calls a “structured Channel Up.” While the “Channel Up” may not be sustained long-term, its consistency thus far suggests that the asset could go on to target price levels above the $100,000 mark, with key prices sitting at $114,000, $124,000, and $134,000. “If this pattern continues to hold for as much time as it has since the bottom, then we may see $134k by late June/ early July.” The analyst wrote as a conclusive observation. Although Bitcoin is slightly down from its all-time high of $109,114, Bitcoin bulls have soared by 22.68% in the last 30 days. During the time of this report, Bitcoin is trading at a press time price of $103,596, with only 0.15% in weekly losses and 0.01% worth of gains sustained over the last hour. It is worth noting that the global cryptocurrency market is trading upwards, with a total market cap valuation of $3.49 trillion and gains over the last 24 hours sitting at 3.97%.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-headed-for-smooth-landing-above-130000-expert-predicts/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Cryptocurrency|Markets|News|Bitcoin News|BTCUSD|BTCUSDC|BTCUSDT|Cryptocurrency News|XBTUSD",cryptocompare
2025-05-22T08:51:44.000Z,"Bitcoin (BTC) Surges to Record High of $111,800","The run-away train that is Bitcoin has broken through the previous all-time high. Bulls have propelled the price to $111,800 so far on Thursday. Bitcoin is soaring into price discovery - how far can this rocketship go? $BTC surges from $74,500 to take out the all-time high It was back in February that the last all-time high of $109,300 was made. Following that high the $BTC price proceeded to slide sideways and downward, and eventually ended up getting all the way back down to $74,500. What many probably didn’t realise, was that this was the bottom of another bull flag that was forming. From this bottom in early April the price rose relatively quickly to take out the all-time high only a matter of five weeks or so later. It now remains to be seen just how much further into price discovery the $BTC price can go. Market sentiment is very much with the leading crypto asset, but there are likely to be some major bumps in the road ahead. USDT.Dominance breaks down Source: TradingView Two charts lend themselves to a continuation of Bitcoin’s ascent. The first is USDT dominance. When this is falling it generally means that money is coming out of the USDT stablecoin and into Bitcoin. The weekly chart is showing that USDT dominance is about to lose the 4.54% support level. If this does occur, dominance could continue decreasing down to the 3.8% support level as more stablecoins are sold into Bitcoin to fuel its rise. $BTC soars against gold Source: TradingView The BTC/GOLD chart makes for interesting viewing. We all know that gold has been on an absolute tear since the latter part of 2023, and that this went into overdrive in April. The rise in gold is probably not over yet by a long chalk, but what we are seeing now is that $BTC is beginning to catch up strongly. The weekly chart above shows that roughly 25 ounces of gold to one BTC was the bottom. Since that swing low $BTC has soared higher, currently at 33.3 ounces, and heading for the 34.6 ounces resistance. What does need to be borne in mind is that the 41 ounce all-time high will need to be surpassed by this current rally in order to maintain the series of higher lows and higher highs, and thereby keep $BTC in the ascendency against gold. Faltering price momentum and thin volume? Source: TradingView Back to $BTC itself, the short-term chart displays the breakout of the rising channel, and the surge up to the new all-time high. It also shows that it may not be just straight up from here. The shorter term Stochastic RSIs are at the top or nearing it. This means that upside price momentum could be about to falter. Another factor to take into account is that volume is quite thin. Volume was much, much higher in previous big breakouts, for example, the breakout of the previous 8-month bull flag. As it stands, volume has been decreasing since November 2024, so it can be imagined that this will need to change. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Hence, we expect the BTC price to create a 2025 high of ~$168,000. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $71,827.81 $119,713.02 $167,598.22 Bitcoin Price Prediction May 2025 In May 2025, Bitcoin’s unstoppable ascent shows no signs of slowing. After recovering from a brief dip triggered by President Trump’s trade deal announcement, BTC has surged to a new all-time high, trading above $110,000, setting the stage for what could be the most significant leg of the 2025 rally. Market sentiment remains highly optimistic. The BTC long/short ratio currently stands at 1.0375, indicating that long positions are outpacing shorts — a clear sign of growing bullish momentum. With this surge, Bitcoin has decisively flipped its previous all-time high and entered price discovery mode. Based on prevailing bullish indicators, BTC is eyeing a short-term target of $120,000, with the potential for even higher levels in the coming months. However, a failure to reach the short-term target could trigger a pullback to $100,000 or lower. Supporting this cautious view, on-chain data reveals that a substantial amount of dormant Bitcoin, unmoved for 5 to 7 years, has recently become active. This kind of movement is often interpreted as a bearish signal, suggesting that long-term holders might be preparing to sell. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 A key factor driving the potential for higher Bitcoin prices is the relationship with global liquidity. Historical trends reveal that as global M2 increases, Bitcoin often experiences dramatic price surges. Now, with global liquidity beginning to rise again after a prolonged period of stagnation, the stage seems set for another major rally in Bitcoin’s value.

Obchakevich believes the latest rally “will strengthen confidence in Bitcoin and lead to new injections into the crypto market.” The surge came as Bitcoin set a new all-time high and now trades above $110,000, which Obchavich said will “attract new investors to large funds.” Obchakevich noted that institutional players continue to play a growing role in the digital asset space:“In May, BlackRock became the second largest bitcoin holder after Satoshi Nakamoto, surpassing Binance in this indicator.”Hassan Khan, the CEO of Bitcoin liquidity platform Ordeez, told Cointelegraph that “this is a structural change.” He explained that “Bitcoin is no longer simply a hedge, it’s in the process of becoming a benchmark currency.”Related: Bitcoin 'looks exhausted' as next bear market yields $69K targetThe crypto market approaches new highsAccording to CoinMarketCap data, the total cryptocurrency market cap stood at $3.49 trillion at the time of writing. While high, this is still nearly 6% lower than the all-time high of $3.71 trillion reported at the end of 2024.Total crypto market cap one-year chart.

The current open interest on crypto derivatives is $756.16 billion for perpetual swaps and $3.24 billion for futures. Looking into the future, Obchakevich shared his view on Bitcoin’s direction:“We are moving gradually towards $200,000, with gradual adjustments. I am sure that this year we will see Bitcoin at $150,000 and $90,000.“Khan said that “large net inflows to ETFs and increasing open interest demonstrate that institutional confidence is growing.” Looking forward, he said:“Short term profit taking and macro rate uncertainty are tempering momentum.

2025-05-22T10:21:18.000Z,"Can ChatGPT-powered AI agents really trade crypto for you?","Key takeawaysChatGPT-powered AI agents automate trading tasks using natural language prompts and API integrations, improving speed and consistency.Successes occur when ChatGPT is used as a support tool, not a fully autonomous trading system.Failures happen when traders over-rely on ChatGPT without real-time data, proper risk management or manual oversight.Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance.What if a crypto trader didn’t need to constantly check charts, worry about emotions, or stay up all night watching for sudden price swings? What if those tasks could be handled by an intelligent agent that understands instructions in plain English — and reacts within milliseconds? That’s where ChatGPT-powered AI agents come in.These tools combine natural language processing with real-time trading logic to automate decision-making in one of the world’s most volatile markets. From rebalancing portfolios to reacting to market sentiment, ChatGPT is being adapted to act as a trading assistant, risk manager and market analyst — all rolled into one. But can it truly match or even outperform human intuition? This article explores how far these agents have come, where they shine and where they still fall short.How ChatGPT-powered AI agents operate in cryptocurrency marketsChatGPT-powered AI agents are changing how people interact with crypto markets. These tools combine ChatGPT’s language abilities with external trading tools and APIs to help users monitor prices, understand trends and even place trades automatically. Instead of just reacting to charts or numbers, ChatGPT can understand plain language commands like “Buy Ethereum if the price drops below $2,000” or “Sell Bitcoin if RSI goes above 70.”These AI trading assistants can work with major platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, OKX and other centralized or decentralized exchanges and can also tap into decentralized finance (DeFi) tools and smart contracts. With the right setup, ChatGPT can help automate trading strategies based on both technical data and market news.Success stories vs. failures in ChatGPT-powered crypto tradingSome traders have used ChatGPT to assist in automating parts of their crypto trading processes, particularly for strategy generation and sentiment analysis. For example, a user shared on Reddit that they used a ChatGPT-based AI agent for technical analysis on Ether (ETH), feeding it four-hour and daily chart screenshots. By interpreting market sentiment, support and resistance zones, and other indicators, they managed to make $6,500 in profits.Similarly, in the broader crypto sector, ChatGPT has been applied to support project development activities such as drafting white papers and marketing content. A notable example is the launch of the “TURBO” memecoin, which reportedly reached a market capitalization of over $50 million in 2024. In this case, ChatGPT was used to streamline documentation and communication rather than manage trading activity, illustrating its usefulness as a support tool in crypto-related initiatives.However, limitations are evident when ChatGPT is applied beyond its core design. While ChatGPT could suggest a trading portfolio and explain its reasoning clearly, it lacks access to real-time market data and couldn’t respond to sudden volatility. In one instance, ChatGPT was allocated $100 across multiple tokens but failed to actively manage the portfolio as prices fluctuated. This resulted in missed opportunities and underperformance compared to dynamic algorithmic strategies.Individual experiences reinforce these observations. A Redditor exposed a scam where a YouTuber promoted a “ChatGPT trading bot” tutorial that led users to deploy malicious smart contracts. The contracts, generated using ChatGPT and passed off as safe, were designed to drain user wallets once funded. Victims collectively lost $17,240 in ETH, highlighting the danger of blindly trusting AI-generated code without proper auditing.Even when asked, “If I use ChatGPT to build an AI agent for crypto trading, can I become a millionaire?” ChatGPT responded with a realistic outlook — acknowledging that while it’s possible, success depends on having a profitable strategy, disciplined risk management, and the ability to scale effectively.Here is ChatGPT’s response:These cases suggest that while ChatGPT can support certain elements of the trading process, it should not be treated as a standalone solution for autonomous crypto trading.AI in crypto trading: Key benefits and limitationsAI tools like ChatGPT are increasingly being integrated into crypto trading workflows to improve speed, accuracy and efficiency. While they offer important advantages, they also carry specific limitations that traders must actively manage. Below are the main benefits and challenges:Key benefits of using AI for crypto tradingAI bots can execute trades in milliseconds, crucial for capturing opportunities in fast-moving crypto markets.Bots follow pre-programmed rules precisely, eliminating emotional biases that often affect human traders.Crypto markets are always open, and AI bots can monitor and act around the clock without interruption.A single bot can manage multiple trading pairs, exchanges and strategies simultaneously.ChatGPT can understand specific prompts like “Rebalance every Monday” or “Set stop-loss at 5%,” allowing flexible automation.Limitations of ChatGPT in cryptocurrency tradingChatGPT does not access live market data unless specifically integrated with external APIs (e.g., TradingView, CoinMarketCap or exchange websockets).Instructions must be clear and unambiguous; ChatGPT may misinterpret vague or complex commands.Improperly secured API keys or lack of two-factor authentication (2FA) can expose trading accounts to unauthorized access.ChatGPT’s cloud-based infrastructure can introduce latency, which could impact performance during highly volatile periods.ChatGPT does not monitor regional compliance rules; users must manually enforce trading limits based on local regulations.Ethical and regulatory implications of AI in crypto tradingAs AI becomes more integrated into trading systems, it raises significant ethical and regulatory concerns that stakeholders across the financial sector are beginning to address.Accountability: If an AI agent executes a harmful or unlawful trade, questions arise around legal responsibility. It remains unclear in many jurisdictions whether liability falls primarily on the developer, the trader using the AI system or the platform facilitating the transactions.Market manipulation risks: Autonomous AI bots could unintentionally engage in activities such as spoofing (placing and canceling fake orders to mislead the market) or wash trading (creating artificial volume), especially if not properly programmed with compliance safeguards.Regulatory oversight: Financial authorities, including the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the European Securities and Markets Authority, are actively studying the implications of AI and algorithmic trading. These agencies have recognized that traditional trading regulations may not fully account for autonomous decision-making by AI systems.Policy developments: In January 2024, the European Commission released updates to its Digital Finance Strategy, which included references to AI-based financial services. While not yet finalized, these draft regulations under the broader Digital Finance Package signal a move toward stricter compliance expectations for firms deploying AI in financial markets.Meanwhile, ethical crypto platforms are beginning to voluntarily disclose the use of trading bots in their systems. In parallel, open-source communities are advocating for clearer audit trails, improved model transparency and the establishment of ethical guidelines for AI applications in finance to ensure accountability and fairness.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Crypto travelers are also outspending their fiat counterparts, with an average booking value of  $1,211 per transaction, over 2.5 times more than fiat users who spend $469.Additionally, the report said crypto users were three times more valuable over their lifetime due to longer stays and higher repeat bookings, with crypto travelers 57% more likely to make a repeat hotel purchase.Source: Binance Pay, TravalaJuan Otero, CEO of Travala, attributed these travel preferences to the flexible nature of Web3 jobs:“Many also work in the digital asset industry or have flexible, remote work lifestyles, which makes them more likely to travel frequently and stay in one place for longer while seeking out destinations that support seamless, global payments.”Crypto-based transactions have become more common in the travel sector and beyond. Airlines that have integrated digital currencies into their booking systems have seen a 40% boost in bookings, with travel and hospitality representing 14% of all crypto transactions in 2024, according to a Feb. 21 report by Triple-A.Related: Crypto spending will grow, but fiat isn’t going anywhere: Mercuryo CEOThe main benefit of using crypto for travel is its borderless, global utility, Jonathan Lim, the global head of Binance Pay, told Cointelegraph. “Travelers can skip currency exchange lines, avoid foreign transaction fees, and pay instantly using assets they already hold,” he added.A growing number of crypto users also drives the increase in travelers using crypto to pay for trips. Triple-A’s report shows that cryptocurrency ownership has a compound annual growth rate of 99%, significantly outpacing the growth of traditional payment methods. Among crypto owners, 65% express interest in using it for payments.Founded in 2017, Travala is among the most popular crypto-native travel platforms, which enables users to pay for services like flights, hotel stays and tours with 141 different cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC) and USDC (USDC) via Binance Pay. Related: Bhutan launches tourism crypto payments with Binance Pay and DK BankCrypto payment covers more and more retail industriesThe first real-world Bitcoin transaction — 10,000 BTC for two pizzas — occurred 15 years ago today, on May 22, 2010, now commemorated as Bitcoin Pizza Day.

2025-05-22T09:01:43.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Forecast - Also Using Liquidation Levels","<p>Bitcoin Price Forecast </p><p>In short, I am watching $117k - $119k on the Bitcoin futures. Now I apologize for the next video not having audio due to a technical issue being looked into, but I am sure most of you with a will, will find a way, and see why.</p><p>Now you will note in the chart within the video, also shown below, that we have that little grey line for an expected price level of liquadation at $115,500. I explain what this means further below.</p><p>Understanding Liquidation Levels and How They Influence Bitcoin Price Forecast</p><p>For Bitcoin traders and investors, understanding liquidation levels—especially those linked to large positions—is crucial. Liquidations can dramatically influence short-term price movements, triggering swift and often volatile market reactions.</p><p>What Does 'Liquidation' Actually Mean?</p><p>In cryptocurrency futures trading, liquidation occurs when a trader's leveraged position is closed automatically by the exchange because the position's margin is no longer sufficient to cover potential losses. Traders holding leveraged long positions (expecting price to rise) will face liquidation if the price moves significantly lower. Conversely, leveraged short positions (expecting prices to drop) face liquidation if prices rise significantly.</p><p>What Is 'Cumulative Short Liquidation Leverage'?</p><p>The \""cumulative short liquidation leverage\"" refers to the total amount of short positions that could be forcibly closed if Bitcoin's price hits a certain level. When the price approaches these liquidation points, shorts become at risk of being liquidated, forcing these traders to buy Bitcoin at market prices to cover their positions. This forced buying adds upward pressure on prices, often triggering even higher spikes.</p><p>Why Bitcoin Traders (and Investors) Should Care</p><p>These liquidation levels act as magnets or significant pivot points in price action. Let's consider two critical liquidation zones for Bitcoin based on recent data:</p><ul><li><p>Above Current Price: At around $115,549, approximately 3.75k BTC worth of short positions could be liquidated. This forced buying could push prices rapidly higher, creating momentum that attracts additional buyers.</p></li><li><p>Below Current Price: A notable zone between approximately $96,000 and $97,335 shows significant potential liquidations of leveraged long positions. If Bitcoin prices drop into this range, substantial selling could be triggered, rapidly pushing prices lower.</p></li></ul><p>How Liquidations Can Propel BTC Futures Price Further</p><p>When a large liquidation occurs (let's say short liquidation at a higher price), traders holding shorts must rapidly buy Bitcoin at the market price to cover their positions. This buying activity creates immediate upward pressure, potentially triggering additional liquidations of other short sellers, causing prices to spike even higher.</p><p>Moreover, these rapid price movements attract momentum traders, scalpers, and short-term speculators who ride the trend further upwards. However, caution is necessary: significant liquidation points often become attractive levels for larger, savvy traders to take profits. Thus, it's common to witness price spiking above critical liquidation levels, followed by a reversal or at least a retest of previously broken resistance or support.</p><p>Key Trading Guidance for Bitcoin Traders</p><ul><li><p>Do Not Treat Liquidation Levels as Precise Reversal Points: Instead, anticipate potential overshoots. Price often moves beyond these levels due to the aggressive market orders and new entrants drawn by the momentum.</p></li><li><p>Expect Potential Reversals Post-Liquidation Spikes: Often, sharp moves above resistance (or below support) are temporary, leading to a reversal as profit-takers seek new buyers or sellers entering at extreme prices.</p></li><li><p>Stay Alert to Retests: After a liquidation-driven breakout, watch carefully if prices return to test the previously significant level—often a key indicator of the next market direction.</p></li></ul><p>Why Track Whales Specifically?</p><p>While standard liquidation maps provide helpful insights, focusing on whale or large institutional positions offers enhanced predictive value. Large traders typically hold sizable positions with significant market impact. Their liquidation points, therefore, are more likely to trigger noticeable price movements, setting off cascades of secondary liquidations and momentum-driven trades. By tracking these larger positions, traders gain clearer insights into potentially explosive market dynamics and critical price thresholds.</p><p>In summary, understanding liquidation dynamics, especially those involving significant \""whale\"" positions, gives Bitcoin traders a vital edge. Remain vigilant around key liquidation zones, anticipate temporary volatility spikes, and prepare for potential reversals and retests. Trade wisely, understanding that these are guides—not guarantees—of price action.</p><p>Bitcoin Price Outlook</p><p>My current analysis indicates a target range of $117,000 - $119,000 for Bitcoin futures.</p><p>Please note that the above video contains visual information only, as a technical issue is currently being addressed which impacts the audio.

2025-05-22T08:37:57.000Z,"Dubai regulator clarifies real-world asset tokenization rules: Lawyer","Newly updated guidelines from Dubai’s crypto regulator include provisions on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and clarify rules for issuers. On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) released its updated Rulebook for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) operating in the region. The regulator gave market participants until June 19 to comply with the new rules. The regulator previously told Cointelegraph that it had enhanced supervisory mechanisms and brought consistency across activity-based rules. One of the more prominent changes includes regulatory clarity on RWA tokens. Irina Heaver, partner at the United Arab Emirates-based law firm NeosLegal, told Cointelegraph that the updated rules clarify RWA issuance and distribution. “Issuing real-world asset tokens and listing them on secondary markets is no longer theoretical,” Heaver told Cointelegraph. “It’s now a regulatory reality in Dubai and the broader UAE.”A “viable” path to realize RWA hypeHeaver compared RWAs to security token offerings (STOs), an earlier attempt from the crypto space to tokenize securities like stocks, bonds and real estate investment trusts. However, the UAE crypto lawyer said that STOs “died a peaceful death in 2018 to 2019.” The lawyer told Cointelegraph STOs did not work out because of the lack of regulatory clarity, viable secondary market trading venues, institutional investor appetite and liquidity. Still, the situation is different for RWAs. Heaver told Cointelegraph that RWAs are the next foundational layer for institutional adoption of blockchain and virtual assets. Heaver said that VARA’s new rules already cover them as Asset-Referenced Virtual Assets (ARVA) tokens. She said: “VARA’s newly updated Virtual Asset Issuance Rulebook (May 2025) addresses these failures head-on. Regulated exchanges and broker-dealers in Dubai are now authorized to distribute and list ARVA tokens.”The lawyer said this solves an issue in jurisdictions like Switzerland, where token issuance is possible, but listing and secondary trading remain unregulated. Related: Dubai gov’t agencies to link real estate registry with property tokenizationLawyer shares requirements for RWA issuersHeaver said ARVA tokens are defined under Dubai law as representing direct or indirect ownership of real-world assets, granting entitlement to receive or share income and purporting to maintain a stable value by reference to real-world assets or income. ARVA tokens are also backed or collateralised by such real-world assets or constitute a derivative, wrapped, duplicated, or fractionalised version of another ARVA. The lawyer said issuers must meet specific requirements, including a Category 1 Virtual Asset Issuance license, a comprehensive white paper and a risk disclosure statement. In addition, issuers must have a paid-up capital of 1.5 million UAE dirhams (about $408,000) or 2% of reserve assets held. The issuers are also subjected to monthly independent audit obligations and must adhere to ongoing supervisory oversight. “VARA is providing regulatory clarity, and it’s giving the industry a viable, enforceable path to turn the hype of RWA tokenization into reality,” Heaver told Cointelegraph. “This matters because it marks a shift, from theory to execution, from fiction to framework.”Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/dubai-vara-guidelines-rwa-tokenization-clarity?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-22T08:25:00.000Z,"5 red flags you’re being shilled: Don’t buy the hype","What is shilling in crypto?              At its core, shilling is the act of artificially promoting a cryptocurrency or token, often with exaggerated claims, to increase its price or popularity. But what’s the goal? Hype it up, get others to buy in, and then cash out, leaving latecomers holding the bag.Shilling can come from anyone: influencers, anonymous accounts or even high-profile figures with political or financial clout. The common thread is manipulation: It’s not about educating you or building real value but pumping hype for personal gain.Unfortunately, the line between enthusiastic promotion and outright deception can be thin, and many fall victim without realizing it. That’s why it’s critical to learn how to spot the signs early.                  5 red flags you’re being shilled              Beware of crypto red flags like overhyped promises, anonymous teams, influencer shills, missing products and FOMO tactics — if it smells like a scam, it probably is.1. Overhyped promises You’ve probably seen posts that scream:“100x potential!”“Guaranteed returns!”“This is your ticket to financial freedom!”These are classic shill tactics. Real, credible projects don’t promise life-changing profits. Why? Because there are no guarantees in crypto or in any investment.When a project leads with grandiose financial claims rather than actual product value or utility, it’s likely a ploy to stir FOMO and attract unsuspecting investors. The truth is, if something sounds too good to be true, it almost always is.Remember: The bigger the promise, the bigger the red flag.2. Anonymous or suspicious teams In crypto, anonymity isn’t always bad, but when you’re trusting people with your money, transparency matters.It’s a major red flag when a project has:No identifiable team membersFake names or aliasesStock photos on its websiteNo LinkedIn or professional history.The simple rule is “No face, no funds.”Scammers often hide behind anonymity because they know they’ll eventually vanish and there’ll be no one to hold accountable. Even worse, some use fabricated credentials or hire actors to pose as team members.Before investing, check whether the founders or developers have any verifiable history. Do they have prior experience in blockchain or startups? Have they launched anything successful before?3. Influencer spam and paid promotions One day, no one’s talking about a particular coin — the next, your feed is flooded with influencers hyping it up. Sound familiar?This sudden burst of attention is often coordinated with a paid promotion campaign disguised as “genuine enthusiasm.”Many influencers fail to disclose sponsorships, even though it’s required by law in many countries. The US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have cracked down on this in recent years.Take, for example:Kim Kardashian, who was fined $1.26 million in 2022 for promoting EthereumMax without proper disclosure.Floyd Mayweather Jr., who was sued for endorsing the same project at a paid event.BitBoy (Ben Armstrong), who faced legal action in multiple lawsuits for promoting scam tokens to his audience.If you notice multiple influencers promoting the same project in a short time, especially without using labels like #ad or #sponsored, it’s a strong indicator of a shill campaign.Don’t mistake volume for value. Hype doesn’t equal legitimacy.4. No real product or roadmapIf you visit the project’s website, it looks sleek, maybe even impressive. But where’s the product? Where’s the code?Shilled tokens often rely on flashy marketing but have no working application, no GitHub code and no actual use case. Everything is either “coming soon” or buried behind vague promises.Ask yourself:Can I use the platform or app today?Is there a white paper that makes sense?Do they have public repositories or open development?If all you’re seeing is a landing page and a vague roadmap that’s been “coming soon” for months, that’s a major red flag.5. Pressure tactics and FOMO Time pressure is a psychological weapon, and shillers know how to use it.Watch out for lines such as:“Presale ends in 2 hours!”“Only 1,000 spots left!”“If you don’t buy now, you’ll miss out forever!”These tactics prey on your fear of missing out (FOMO) and push you into making impulsive decisions without research.But crypto isn’t a sprint; it’s a long-term game. Anyone trying to rush you into buying likely has something to hide. Solid investments don’t need fake urgency.Take a breath, step back, and ask yourself: Am I buying because I believe in this project or because I’m being manipulated?Did you know? The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) secured a $128-million judgment against Ryan Mitchell Pope, Daniel Samuel Bishop and their company EmpiresX for operating a fraudulent forex and cryptocurrency investment scheme that defrauded over 12,500 victims.                  Is shilling illegal in crypto? Can influencers be sued?              Shilling isn’t just unethical in many cases — it’s also illegal.In the world of crypto, undisclosed promotions are a major legal risk. If someone is paid to promote a token or project but fails to reveal that financial connection, they could face fines, lawsuits or even criminal charges. This is especially true if the promoted token is later classified as a security under US law.Regulators like the SEC, FTC and CFTC have all cracked down on this behavior. Their targets have included:Influencers who failed to disclose paid promotionsPromoters who misled investors with false claimsIndividuals who ran pump-and-dump schemes using social media.Francier Obando Pinillo, a pastor from Miami, was indicted on 26 fraud counts for running a crypto scam through “Solano Fi,” defrauding investors of millions from 2021 to 2023. He allegedly used his church, social media and false promises of 34.9% monthly returns to lure victims. The platform showed fake gains but blocked withdrawals, while funds were diverted for personal use. Pinillo was arraigned in Richland, Washington and faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.As crypto becomes more mainstream, expect stricter regulations and more consequences for shillers.Did you know? Argentine President Javier Milei has dissolved the special task force investigating the LIBRA cryptocurrency scandal, a project he promoted in February 2025 that surged to a $4.5-billion valuation before crashing by over 97%. The task force, created by Milei himself, was disbanded via Decree 332/2025, citing that it had fulfilled its purpose. However, critics argue that no official findings were released, and judicial investigations into Milei and his associates continue.                  How to protect yourself from shilling scams              Do your own research, verify the team and utility, ignore hype and influencers, and stay alert to pump-and-dump schemes to avoid crypto shilling traps.Let’s understand how you can protect yourself from shilling scams in crypto:Do your own research (DYOR): Always research the project, the team behind it and the data supporting the claims. Don’t rely solely on hype or influencer recommendations. Look into onchain data, GitHub activity and the project’s utility to make informed decisions.Verify the team: A legitimate crypto project should have a transparent and credible team. If the developers are anonymous or have no professional profiles (like LinkedIn), that’s a red flag. Always check the team’s past projects and credibility before investing.Look for real utility: Does this project actually solve a problem? A genuine project should have a working product or solution, not just promises. Avoid projects that lack real-world utility or are still in “coming soon” stages for extended periods.Ignore the hype: If a token is suddenly trending on social media or being aggressively promoted, don’t let FOMO influence your judgment. Shillers often rely on emotions to push their agenda, so it’s essential to evaluate projects based on their merits, not just popularity.Stay skeptical of influencers: Influencers with large followings may be paid to promote certain tokens. Before taking their advice, ask yourself, What’s their incentive? Verify the promotion is legitimate and disclosed as paid or sponsored. Always cross-check the information with independent sources.Watch for pump-and-dump schemes: Be cautious of sudden price spikes followed by rapid drops. These are often signs of pump-and-dump schemes where the token’s value is artificially inflated by coordinated buying and then quickly sold off, leaving investors with losses. Always monitor price trends and be wary of sudden, unexplained increases in value.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/5-red-flags-youre-being-shilled-dont-buy-the-hype?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Special leave is required in an appeal to the High Court, and it’s only granted in cases where it would answer significant legal questions or matters of public interest.A Block Earner spokesperson told Cointelegraph the matter has now escalated to a “broader legal question” around the definition of a financial product, which extends “well beyond Block Earner, and the crypto sector.” “We believe the Full Federal Court’s April ruling was a strong and well-reasoned decision that upheld the integrity of our operations,” the spokesperson said. “We remain confident in the soundness of that judgment and will respond to ASIC’s application through the appropriate legal channels.” Legal saga ongoing since 2022ASIC first launched legal proceedings against Block Earner in November 2022, arguing the company needed a financial services license to offer its yield product which was available from March 17, 2022, until the company shut it down on Nov. 16, 2022.Related: Australia outlines crypto regulation plan, promises action on debankingASIC was arguing Block Earner needed a financial services license to offer its crypto-linked fixed-yield earning product.

The steps include a new, trustless architecture, a native token, and the Seeker ship date.According to the announcement, Solana Mobile will ship the device starting Aug. 4. Seeker is the company’s second-generation device, after the Saga Web3 phone that launched in April 2023. The company unveiled the Seeker phone in September 2024, saying it wouldn’t just be a “memecoin phone.” So far, it has pre-sold 150,000 units.The Solana Seeker has gone through two sale phases: The Founder window, where the price for each device was $450, and the Early Adopter window, where the price per device was $500. Assuming the lower price window, Solana Mobile could generate at least $67.5 million in gross revenue from device sales. For comparison, the iPhone generated $199.3 billion in revenue for Apple in 2024.The new architecture that will govern future Solana Mobile devices is called TEEPIN, which stands for “Trusted Execution Environment Platform Infrastructure Network.” It is a three-layer architecture — hardware, platform, and network layers — that will allow users, developers, and device makers to participate in a trustless environment.Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder and CEO of Solana Labs, called TEEPIN “the next evolution in mobile” and a framework where trust is “verified by cryptography.”In addition, Solana Mobile is planning to launch “SKR,” the native asset of the Solana Mobile ecosystem. \""It transforms the traditional mobile business model by giving stakeholders actual ownership in the platform,” said Emmett Hollyer, general manager at Solana Mobile.

From a broad perspective, the $77 billion in Bitcoin futures open interest has undoubtedly played a role. However, a closer look at the data shows a more positive outlook for further price gains.Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.chThe current 7% annualized Bitcoin futures premium is well within the neutral range of 5% to 10%, which has been typical for the past two weeks. This indicator can easily exceed 30% during periods of strong optimism, so the current level is relatively low. At the same time, the absence of excessive leverage reduces concerns about a rally driven primarily by derivatives.Balanced order books and spot Bitcoin ETF inflows point to spot-driven rallyFor comparison, during the previous Bitcoin $109,346 all-time high on Jan. 20, the annualized futures premium reached 15%, showing a much higher level of leveraged bullish positions affecting the price. Therefore, the current Bitcoin derivatives market appears healthier, suggesting strong demand in spot markets.During the January bull run, Bitcoin’s price on Coinbase traded at a premium compared to other exchanges. This so-called Coinbase premium is not present now, which means buying pressure is more evenly spread out—a sign of a healthier market.Coinbase Bitcoin/USD relative to competitors. Source: TradingView / CointelegraphWhile excessive buying pressure on a single exchange is not necessarily bearish, it can make it easier to trigger unsustainable price surges when liquidity is low. This data supports the idea that derivatives markets were not the main driver of the recent price increases. Moreover, the $1.37 billion in net inflows to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States between May 15 and May 20 further suggests that spot buyers, rather than derivatives traders, were the primary force behind the rally.Despite the lack of conviction in Bitcoin futures, several indicators point to further upside. Forced liquidations of bearish BTC futures positions were relatively low at $170 million between May 18 and May 21, cementing the idea of a spot-driven rally. In comparison, the rally to $104,000 on May 9 triggered $538 million in liquidations over three days.Related: Is Bitcoin price close to a cycle top? — 5 indicators that help traders decideBitcoin options put-to-call ratio at Deribit.

2025-05-21T17:55:00.000Z,"Interest groups, lawmakers to protest Trump&#039;s memecoin dinner","Democratic leaning organizations and members of Congress have announced plans to protest what they describe as the sale of access to the office of the US president, in reference to Donald Trump’s memecoin dinner on May 22. The event’s attendees are said to have collectively spent over $100 million for the chance to meet with the US president.Since Trump’s memecoin project, Official Trump (TRUMP), announced that its top 220 tokenholders would have an opportunity to apply for an exclusive dinner with the president, many leaders in the crypto industry and US lawmakers have criticized the event, saying Trump was opening his office to potential bribery and corruption. The memecoin dinner prompted some Democratic lawmakers to withdraw support for crypto-related legislation in Congress, including the market structure and stablecoin bills.“Trump collecting gifts from foreign governments is unconstitutional,” a spokesperson for the consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen, which is planning to protest near the memecoin dinner on May 22, told Cointelegraph. “Collecting foreign government investments through his memecoin is not much better. American foreign policy should not be for sale.”Source: Public CitizenCrypto industry figures such as Tron founder Justin Sun, Kronos Research chief investment officer Vincent Liu, Hyperithm co-CEO Oh Sangrok, and Synthetix founder Kain Warwick are among the tokenholders expected to attend the dinner at the Trump National Golf Club outside Washington, DC. The memecoin project said all applicants had to pass a background check and could not be from a “[Know Your Customer] watchlist country.”Related: Democrats seek suspicious activity reports linked to Trump crypto venturesPublic Citizen, in partnership with progressive political organization Our Revolution, will hold a rally near the golf club, which Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley is expected to attend. In addition, the Arlington and Loudoun Democrats will be hosting a separate event to urge US officials to “hold [Trump] accountable,” and Democratic leadership in Congress has scheduled two press events on May 22 ahead of the dinner.“Americans cannot and will not accept President Trump’s view that positions of power exist only to benefit the holder of that power,” Ryan Ruzic, chair of the Loudoun County Democratic Committee, told Cointelegraph. “We have a moral responsibility to speak out against corruption, whatever the result may be.”Pushback on TRUMP memecoin affected crypto legislationSome lawmakers initially cited the memecoin dinner and the Trump family’s involvement with the crypto platform World Liberty Financial in opposing passage of the GENIUS Act, a bill to regulate payment stablecoins. World Liberty Financial began issuing its own USD1 stablecoin in March, prompting concerns about Trump’s conflicts of interest. However, the legislation passed a key procedural vote in the Senate on May 19 with support from Democrats, setting the bill up for debate in the chamber.“Many senators, myself included, have very real concerns about the Trump family’s use of crypto technologies to evade oversight, hide shady financial dealings, and personally profit at the expense of everyday Americans,” said Sen. Mark Warner in a statement before the May 19 vote, adding: “But we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay.”Senator Chris Murphy, who voted against advancing the GENIUS Act, called for bipartisan support in amending the bill to specifically bar a US president from issuing stablecoins. He also called on the White House to release a complete list of attendees to the memecoin dinner, suggesting that some or all of them would “try to get something from the president” in exchange for purchasing the tokens. Murphy and Senator Elizabeth Warren will attend a press event with representatives for Public Citizen on May 22. California Representative Maxine Waters, ranking member of the US House Financial Services Committee, announced a separate press conference for the same day, with plans to introduce a bill to “block Trump’s memecoin and stop his crypto corruption, once and for all.”As of May 21, the exact number of attendees to the dinner was unknown. A smaller group of 25 tokenholders also qualified to apply for “VIP tour” and reception — presumably at the White House — with Trump, but the complete list of those planning to attend was also unknown at the time of publication.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/protest-donald-trump-memecoin-dinner?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-21T17:02:48.000Z,"Is Bitcoin price close to a cycle top? — 5 indicators that help traders decide","Key takeaways:Bitcoin market cycle tops are notoriously hard to time, but combining technical and behavioral indicators can offer strong signals.The MVRV-Z Score, Pi Cycle Top indicator, trade volume trends, Puell Multiple, and exchange inflows accurately predict Bitcoin price cycle tops.Bitcoin (BTC) might be approaching the final stage of its current market cycle — a dramatic final rally followed by a sharp correction and, eventually, a bear market. For many, this could be the long-awaited climax of the past four years, and major players are preparing accordingly.Since late 2024, Bitcoin whale accumulation has surged. Glassnode data shows that the number of addresses holding over 100 BTC has jumped by almost 14%, reaching 18,200 — a level not seen since 2017. The biggest market players appear to be positioning for what could be this cycle’s final run-up.Number of BTC addresses holding over 100 BTC. Source: GlassnodeHowever, riding the rally is trickier than it looks and knowing when to exit is notoriously difficult. The lure of higher price highs fuels FOMO, driving investors to buy the top, only to face painful drawdowns or even liquidations.So, how can traders and investors spot the top before the market enters recession?Bitcoin cycle top markersSeveral technical and onchain indicators, such as MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Z-score, Pi Cycle Top, and trading volume trends, have historically been reliable in signaling when Bitcoin is nearing its peak.The MVRV-Z score compares Bitcoin’s market value to its realized value and adjusts for volatility. A high Z-score suggests Bitcoin is significantly overvalued relative to its historical cost basis. When this indicator is at a historical high, the ensuing downward trend in Bitcoin prices is likely.The Pi Cycle Top tracks BTC price dynamics using moving averages. When the 111-day moving average (111-SMA) crosses above twice the 350-day average (350-SMAx2), it signals overheating. In other words, when the short-term trend catches up to the long-term trajectory, a market top is in.Historically, all previous Bitcoin bull runs started with a notable surge in MVRV Z-score, and ended with 111-SMA crossing the longer-term trend.BTC: Pi Cycle Top + MVRV Z-score. Source: Marie Poteriaieva, GlassnodeAdditionally, lower trading volumes during price increases can be a warning sign, often signaling weakening momentum and potential for a reversal. On-balance volume (OBV), which registers cumulative volume flow, is a valuable metric for tracking this process. When OBV diverges from the price action, it is often an early reversal signal. The second leg of the 2021 bull run was a great example. While BTC price was hitting higher highs of $68,000 (compared to the previous all-time high of $63,170), trading volumes moved in a different direction, decreasing from 710,000 BTC to 628,000 BTC. This created a bearish divergence between price and volume, suggesting that fewer market participants were supporting the rally — a classic sign of waning momentum.BTC/USD 1-day, OBV. Source: Marie Poteriaieva, TradingViewProfit-taking metricsAs market cycle tops approach, long-term holders and Bitcoin miners often start locking in profits. Some valuable metrics that can track it are the Puell Multiple and exchange flows.The Puell Multiple Indicator looks at miners' revenue relative to its 365-day average. High readings indicate miners may start selling aggressively, and are often seen near market tops.Large inflows to exchanges are usually signs of distribution, as investors prepare to sell their coins. BTC total transfer volume to exchanges + Puell Multiple.

Bitcoin moves vertically for weeks, with massive $10,000+ daily candles.Whiplash. Bitcoin experiences its sharpest correction of the bull cycle. The curved parabolic trendline that’s supported the rally is broken — a clear signal that the top is likely in. Meanwhile, altcoins and meme tokens may continue pumping a little longer.Complacency. Measure 15% below Bitcoin’s all-time high. That’s the sell zone. Order books on major exchanges often show a wall of sell orders around this level — a likely institutional exit point.According to Garner, the 15% (or 16%) rule works not only in crypto but in traditional markets as well.Historical blow off-tops: BTC, ETH, gold, Nasdaq, Nikkei, Broadvision, 3D Systems.

In a May 21 social media post that begins with, “The Empire Lobbies Back,” Campbell claimed that the banking industry is especially alarmed by the potential for stablecoins to offer interest or rewards to holders. In a pointed message aimed at Democratic lawmakers, Campbell wrote that “banks want you to protect their cartel so they can keep screwing your voters.” He went on to explain how fractional reserve banking enables banks to maximize profits while offering depositors minimal interest.The banking lobby says that if stablecoins pay interest or any other type of monetary reward, banks will be “harmed,” Campbell added.An excerpt of Campbell’s X post.

In line with its current trajectory, 21st Capital co-founder Sina noted that Bitcoin is approaching a pivotal moment around the $108,000 level. The Bitcoin Quantile Model update shows that BTC’s market reflects the same “heat” that was present after President Trump’s post-election rally and the spot ETF-driven highs during Q4 2024. The model, which uses quantile regression to map Bitcoin’s price phases on a logarithmic scale, indicates the cryptocurrency is in the Transition Zone, a critical juncture before the Acceleration Phase. Throughout Q4, 2024, Bitcoin rallied by 45% after entering a price discovery period above $74,500. Bitcoin Quantile Model. Source: X.comAs illustrated in the chart, once it breaks into the \""Acceleration\"" Phase, it could trigger BTC’s next leg or the mid-phase, typically between the 33% and 66% range. Based on the model, BTC is expected to progressively target price levels of $130,000 and $163,000 in the coming months. However, anonymous Bitcoin analyst apsk32 believed a price target above $200,000 is a “reasonable” expectation for 2025. Basing the projection on Bitcoin’s “power curve,” the analyst noted that BTC’s position relative to gold has significantly improved since April. From a technical standpoint, this view is supported by the recent convergence of the Sharpe ratios for Bitcoin and gold, suggesting that the two hard assets now offer comparable risk-to-reward profiles to their investors. Fidelity’s Director of Global Macro Jurrien Timmer shed light on this development, recommending a 4:1 goal-to-Bitcoin ratio from an allocation perspective. Related: Bitcoin 'blow-off top' set at $128K with new all-time highs in sightStrong Bitcoin volumes “final straw” before new highs Crypto researcher Aylo analyzed BTC’s historical price action when the crypto asset consolidates near its all-time high level. In an X post, the analyst explained, “The data shows when BTC gets close to its previous ATH during a strong, accelerating trend with high momentum, it has historically broken out to new ATHs within a short time (days to weeks).”However, weaker trends have led to stalls or retraces between March and May 2024. Currently, Bitcoin exhibits a strong trend but lacks the necessary trading volume, which remains the final straw to confirm a breakout, a factor that could delay upward movement.Alyo added that for Bitcoin to break its all-time highs, daily trading volume should exceed the previous 10 days, be at least 1.5 times the 20-day average, and ideally sustain a 3-day increase while the price holds steady or rises.Data from CryptoQuant has reinforced Aylo’s concerns about trading volume.

2025-05-21T15:00:00.000Z,"How to handle crypto trading gains and losses on your balance sheet","Key takeawaysProperly accounting for crypto assets on your balance sheet is essential for accurate tax reporting and financial transparency.Crypto trading activities should be recorded like stock trading, at fair market value on the day of purchase.In some countries, like the US, crypto losses can offset gains, so keeping track of gains and losses is important for reducing taxable income.Whether you’re an individual investor or a business, treating cryptocurrencies as assets and documenting them ensures compliance with tax laws and minimizes the risk of errors.Let’s be real, it’s easy to lose sight of what you’ve actually gained or lost, especially when it comes to crypto and its market volatility and frequent trading activities. And when it comes to accounting, especially in countries like the United States, it gets trickier because you must reflect those numbers properly on your balance sheet. If you are running a business that involves crypto or you are just a crypto investor, understanding how to account for your digital assets correctly is crucial. This guide breaks down the basics of balance sheets, handling crypto gains and losses, and what tax implications you need to account for.What is a balance sheet, and why is it needed?Think of a balance sheet as a report of your financial health. It shows what you own, owe and what’s left over at a specific point in time. It contains three main parts: Assets: What the company owns, such as cash, crypto, real estate, inventory, etc.Liabilities: What the company owes, such as loans, unpaid bills and taxesEquity: What’s left after subtracting liabilities from assets (net worth).For example, if you own $50,000 worth of crypto, and at the same time, you owe someone $20,000. In this case, your equity is $30,000. Balance sheets help you understand your financial position at a glance. They’re essential for filing taxes, attracting investors, applying for loans and complying with regulations. Balance sheets are essential in countries like the United States, where businesses must report crypto holdings accurately for tax and compliance reasons. Similarly, in the UK, European countries and Canada, balance sheets are important for businesses and are often used by individuals, especially when dealing with crypto assets. It’s not just for taxes. A well-maintained balance sheet can help you get funding, plan your finances, or simply sleep better knowing where you stand at night.How do you treat crypto on a balance sheet?One of the most common questions when preparing a balance sheet is, “How to report crypto trading gains and losses on a balance sheet?” In most jurisdictions, the crypto reporting and taxation rules are still to be decided or clarified. This also applies to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which lack definitive guidance concerning cryptocurrency accounting.As cryptocurrencies are considered assets in many jurisdictions, the fundamental concepts of accounting for assets could apply when preparing a balance sheet involving crypto transactions. Below is an example of a simplified crypto balance sheet treatment and some helpful pointers that may assist you in accounting for crypto trading in 2025.Notes to the balance sheet:Cash ($15,000): Represents fiat currency (e.g., USD) held in bank accounts or wallets, including proceeds from selling crypto or other revenue.Cryptocurrency ($20,000): Recorded at cost basis (fair market value at acquisition, less any impairment). Includes 0.5 Bitcoin (BTC) purchased at $30,000 each ($15,000 total) and 10 Ether (ETH) purchased at $500 each ($5,000 total). No impairment has been recorded, assuming the fair market value (FMV) remains above cost.Mining equipment ($5,000): Capitalized cost of crypto mining hardware, net of depreciation. The original cost was $8,000, with $3,000 accumulated depreciation over two years.Accounts payable ($2,000): Unpaid bills (e.g., for electricity or supplier services related to crypto mining operations).Taxes payable ($1,500): Estimated tax liability for realized crypto gains (e.g., from selling 0.1 BTC at a $2,000 gain, taxed at 20% long-term capital gains rate for simplicity).Retained earnings ($36,500): Accumulated profits, including crypto-related income (e.g., mining revenue, realized gains) minus expenses and taxes. Reflects net income from prior and current periods.When buying cryptocurrency with fiat moneyWhen you buy cryptocurrency with fiat money, such as dollars or euros, you’re simply exchanging one type of asset, such as cash, for another, like crypto or stocks. On your balance sheet, cryptocurrency trading activities should be recorded similarly to those of stock trading activities. As with stocks, you should record cryptocurrency on your balance sheet at its fair market value on the day of purchase. While your cash account displays a credit for the same amount, the cryptocurrency is recorded as a debit to your assets account.When selling cryptocurrency for fiat moneySelling crypto for fiat creates a change in your balance sheet: Your crypto holdings will be reduced, meaning credited, and your cash will increase, which also means that the account will be credited.If you sell for more than you paid (the original price of a token), you have a gain; if you sell for less, you record a loss. Both crypto gains and crypto losses should be tracked carefully for tax and reporting purposes.How to record crypto lossesThe difference is recorded as a loss when you sell crypto at a lower price than you bought it for. In some countries, these losses can lower your taxable income, so it can prove useful to properly document them.  However, even if the asset regains its previous price levels, impairment losses cannot be undone in accordance with GAAP’s accounting rules for intangible assets.This contrasts with IFRS, where certain intangible assets can be revalued upward under IAS 38 if an active market exists. However, crypto markets are volatile, and IFRS guidance on crypto revaluation remains unclear, so most entities stick to cost-less impairment. Businesses should consult local accounting standards and auditors for precise treatment.How to record crypto profitsIf you receive cryptocurrency as payment for goods, services or other activities, it’s treated as income at the fair market value on the date you receive it. This value is recorded as revenue and added to your assets. Later, if you sell or swap the crypto, any difference in value will result in a capital gain or loss.How to record crypto mining When cryptocurrency mining income occurs, it should be reported at the currency’s fair market value. This revenue should be shown on your income statement since it increases your assets.Similar to other revenue-generating activities, companies engaged in cryptocurrency mining are required to report their crypto profits on their balance sheet. Their mining income account will be credited as a result. Subsequently, the newly generated digital asset has to be recorded in their accounts at its fair market value.Additionally, costs related to mining operations should be recorded. For example, the cash account needs to be credited if cash is spent to cover mining costs. The purchase of mining equipment, which requires capitalization and amortization, will subsequently be deducted from the associated asset account or otherwise documented as a cost for items like utilities and supplies.Using cryptocurrency to pay suppliersPaying suppliers or vendors with cryptocurrency is like selling the asset since you have to recognize any gain or loss in relation to its original value. Therefore, the difference between the asset’s book value and its expense will be recorded as a capital gain.How to record transaction fees and exchange rates It’s critical to keep track of transaction costs and exchange rate fluctuations when trading or exchanging cryptocurrencies. Fees should be shown as an expense on the balance sheet since they lower your net gain or increase your loss. Changes in exchange rates may also have an impact on the value recorded when converting cryptocurrency into fiat, which could have an effect on your taxes and capital gains.Did you know? Cryptocurrency held for more than a year can be categorized as a long-term asset on your balance sheet in some jurisdictions, which may result in better tax treatment than short-term holdings.How are cryptocurrencies taxed?Taxation of cryptocurrencies varies by country, but your balance sheet plays a crucial role in tracking taxable events. Under current GAAP, crypto is recorded at cost and tested for impairment. IFRS allows revaluation in rare cases, but most entities use the cost model. For traders holding crypto as inventory, GAAP (ASC 330) or IFRS (IAS 2) may apply, with FMV adjustments. The lack of definitive guidance means businesses must apply judgment and document assumptions clearly. In the US, crypto is treated as property, with taxes applied to capital gains when selling or trading. The Internal Revenue Service requires reporting on your balance sheet; losses can offset gains. Also, the US introduced Form 1099-DA in 2025 for crypto brokers to report transactions, increasing compliance requirements. In the UK, cryptocurrencies are taxed under capital gains for individuals, while income tax may apply if trading is frequent or when crypto is received as income, such as through mining, staking or as payment for services.Canada follows a similar approach, taxing crypto as capital gains (50% inclusion rate) or business income for active traders. Mining income is taxable as income.In Germany, long-term holders (over a year) pay no tax on capital gains, but short-term trades over 600 euros are taxed. Notably, the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation (effective 2024) standardizes crypto reporting, impacting balance sheet documentation in member states.Accounting for Ethereum transactionsEthereum, the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts, has unique accounting needs. Here’s how to handle common Ethereum transactions on your balance sheet:Staking rewards: Staking ETH on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network generates rewards, treated as income at FMV when received. For example, receiving 0.1 ETH as a staking reward debits your “Cryptocurrency” asset account and credits “Revenue” on your income statement. Selling staked ETH later triggers a capital gain or loss.Gas fees: Ethereum transactions incur gas fees, which are expenses. Record these as a debit to “Transaction Fees” (an expense account) and a credit to “Cash” or “Cryptocurrency” if paid in ETH. For example, a $50 gas fee paid in ETH reduces your ETH holdings and is expensed.DeFi transactions: Yield farming or liquidity provision (e.g., on Uniswap) generates rewards, treated as income at FMV when received. For example, earning 100 UNI (UNI) tokens ($1,000) debits “Cryptocurrency” and credits “Revenue.” Track gas fees and token swaps as expenses or taxable events.ERC-20 tokens: Ethereum-based tokens (e.g., USDC, LINK) are separate assets. Record each at its FMV at acquisition, like ETH, and track them individually to avoid confusion.Accurate tracking of Ethereum transactions ensures compliance, especially with increased IRS scrutiny on staking and DeFi in 2025.Tools and best practices for crypto accountingManaging crypto transactions can be daunting, but these tools and tips simplify the process:Accounting software: Use platforms like CoinTracker, Koinly or CryptoTaxCalculator to track Ethereum transactions, calculate gains/losses, and generate tax reports. These tools integrate with wallets and exchanges, ensuring accurate FMV records.Regular reconciliation: Match your balance sheet’s crypto holdings to wallet/exchange records monthly to catch errors, especially for gas fees or staking rewards.Work with professionals: Crypto tax rules, especially for Ethereum’s DeFi and staking, are complex. Consult a crypto-savvy accountant to ensure compliance with IRS, His Majesty’s Revenue & Customs or other regulations.Document everything: Keep records of every Ethereum transaction, including FMV, gas fees and staking rewards, to prepare for audits or Form 1099-DA reporting in 2025.By staying organized, you’ll minimize errors and stress when filing taxes or preparing financial statements.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-trading-gains-and-losses-on-balance-sheet?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-21T15:00:00.000Z,"Crypto&#039;s real momentum isn&#039;t in the charts; it&#039;s in developer activity","Opinion by: Markus Levin, co-founder of XYOThe crypto community often experiences periods of heightened anxiety. Market downturns are often triggered by counterproductive sentiment-driven events rather than by fundamental issues, creating a significant disconnect between price behavior and the actual progress being made within the industry by the companies within it. What often goes unnoticed is how much real development happens during these downturns. While market movements capture most of the attention, teams are building faster and more deliberately behind the scenes than ever. The focus shifts away from price speculation and toward real execution. Growth happens during downturns. It's a necessary phase for projects that thrive in a volatile industry. They re-focus attention on refining their technology and business, fueling the next wave of progress.As a result, there's a disconnect between online sentiment and conversations between blockchain industry leaders. For builders and project leaders, the atmosphere is of determination, not doom.Regulators are coming on boardOne of the most promising developments is the accelerating momentum of regulation policy. Many European companies are applying for MiCA licenses in preparation for regulatory updates. There's also a significant policy shift under new US leadership as the SEC retreats from several high-profile crypto enforcement actions. The disparity between sentiment and reality serves as a reminder that price is a lagging indicator. Selloffs are triggered by uncertainty around tariff announcements and background activity such as interest rates. Material, long-term statistics speak for the virtually universal optimism among industry leaders as the number of active developers has remained stable, and the number of established developers almost doubled last year. That's an incredible jump in only one year. From hype to substanceMaturation means teams thoughtfully building, governments engaging seriously with legislation, and users demanding better UX and real utility. The industry has a well-established pattern — market corrections wipe away hype and encourage focus. The last bear market gave rise to breakthroughs in DeFi, NFTs, and zero-knowledge tech. This time, it's about real-world infrastructure, regulation-ready platforms, and next-gen scalability.What emerges in these periods tends to be less visible but more durable. Teams that remain active are often those with clear models, sufficient runway, and a willingness to adapt. These are the periods when we learn whether the systems being built can handle real-world demands. One of the most promising frontiers lies at the intersection of AI and blockchain, the most ubiquitous being within Large Language Models. AI is, however, only as good as the data it's trained on.AI systems are evolving rapidly, but their foundations are skewed. They're built primarily on data scraped from the digital-first countries that predominantly lie in the northern hemisphere, which dominates global media production and internet usage. This creates a feedback loop where Western and East Asian perspectives and widely spoken languages such as English and Mandarin are not only amplified but leave little room for necessary data from smaller populations.A report from Web3 Technologies said 60% of tier-one media on the internet is English. Prominent among these media outlets is The New York Times, which has sued OpenAI based on copyright infringement. The publication alleges that their copyright-protected data was used to train OpenAI's LLM model. Recent: The future of finance is built on Bitcoin — Ethereum was just the testnetKnowing the full extent of the global imbalance in the data creating AI outputs is impossible. Allegations like this and the results delivered when using AI tools suggest the pressing need for a solution.It's even worse. When AI systems are trained on narrow, incomplete data sets, the results can exclude billions from the benefits of emerging technologies. As IBM highlights, data bias isn't just a technical issue — it's a human one with real-world consequences in healthcare, finance, agriculture, and beyond.It's become normal to use AI data every day. We receive personalized Google search results, Adobe has built AI into its industry-standard graphic and video software, and we use AI assistants like Gemini, Grok, and ChatGPT to formulate the thoughts with which we represent ourselves. All of these tools are affected by an overwhelming bias toward the center of a bell curve within their data sets, unable to access or address less common use cases.A popular example demonstrates this issue: Until recently, image generators could not create a full wine glass. No matter what prompt you provided, a wine glass full to the edge was beyond the capabilities of all known generative AI software because they had never been provided photos of wine glasses full to the brim. Their data sets had to be updated to correct this comical problem, which revealed a much more serious one.Decentralized data offers a solution. Globally incentivized systems like DePINs enable the participation of populations that would otherwise remain underserved, allowing the valuable data they provide to come online. This improves the service for everyone, making smaller global communities more accessible to commerce and enabling them easier access to the rest of the world. It also empowers smaller data creators to monetize their data rather than relinquishing it to tech giants. Where do we go from here?The crypto industry is entering a new phase. A phase that's more productive and sustainable. Expect to see rapid growth in working infrastructure, platforms and applications that welcome knowledgeable, consumer-friendly regulations and projects that respect the time and money of their users.Opportunities within the crypto space are changing but not shrinking. Our opportunities grow as we learn from what has not worked in the last few years. They will take time to develop, but successful builders will focus on long-term, incremental change and sound business practices rather than chasing fads and short-term profits.The momentum of real progress has never been stronger, and it is precisely during times like these, when it feels like no one's watching, that the foundations of the future are laid.Opinion by: Markus Levin, co-founder of XYO.

Source: Trugard and WebacyCrypto address poisoning is a scam where attackers send small amounts of cryptocurrency from a wallet address that closely resembles a target’s real address, often with the same starting and ending characters. The goal is to trick the user into accidentally copying and reusing the attacker’s address in future transactions, resulting in lost funds.The technique exploits how users often rely on partial address matching or clipboard history when sending crypto. A January 2025 study found that over 270 million poisoning attempts occurred on BNB Chain and Ethereum between July 1, 2022, and June 30, 2024. Of those, 6,000 attempts were successful, leading to losses over $83 million.Related: What are address poisoning attacks in crypto and how to avoid them?Web2 security in a Web3 worldTrugard chief technology officer Jeremiah O’Connor told Cointelegraph that the team brings deep cybersecurity expertise from the Web2 world, which they’ve been “applying to Web3 data since the early days of crypto.” The team is applying its experience with algorithmic feature engineering from traditional systems to Web3. He added:“Most existing Web3 attack detection systems rely on static rules or basic transaction filtering. These methods often fall behind evolving attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures.“The newly developed system instead leverages machine learning to create a system that learns and adapts to address poisoning attacks. O’Connor highlighted that what sets their system apart is “its emphasis on context and pattern recognition.” Isogawa explained that “AI can detect patterns often beyond the reach of human analysis.”Related: Jameson Lopp sounds alarm on Bitcoin address poisoning attacksThe machine learning approachO’Connor said Trugard generated synthetic training data for the AI to simulate various attack patterns. Then the model was trained through supervised learning, a type of machine learning where a model is trained on labeled data, including input variables and the correct output.In such a setup, the goal is for the model to learn the relationship between inputs and outputs to predict the correct output for new, unseen inputs. Common examples include spam detection, image classification and price prediction.O’Connor said the model is also updated by training it on new data as new strategies emerge. “To top it off, we’ve built a synthetic data generation layer that lets us continuously test the model against simulated poisoning scenarios,” he said. “This has proven incredibly effective in helping the model generalize and stay robust over time.“Magazine: Crypto-Sec: Phishing scammer goes after Hedera users, address poisoner gets $70K",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-system-has-97-claimed-efficacy-in-preventing-address-poisoning-attacks?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-21T11:19:25.000Z,"Yield-bearing stablecoins surge to $11B, now 4.5% of market: Report","Yield-bearing stablecoins have soared to $11 billion in circulation, representing 4.5% of the total stablecoin market — a steep climb from just $1.5 billion and a 1% market share at the start of 2024.One of the biggest winners of this trend is Pendle, a decentralized protocol that enables users to lock in fixed yields or speculate on variable interest rates. Pendle now accounts for 30% of all yield-bearing stablecoin total value locked (TVL), roughly $3 billion, the firm said in a report shared with Cointelegraph.  Pendle noted that stablecoins make up 83% of its $4 billion total value locked, a sharp rise from less than 20% just a year ago. In contrast, assets such as Ether (ETH), which historically contributed 80–90% of Pendle’s TVL, have shrunk to less than 10% of its TVL.Traditional stablecoins like USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC) do not pass on interest to holders. With over $200 billion in circulation and US Federal Reserve interest rates at 4.3%, Pendle estimated that stablecoin holders are missing out on over $9 billion in annual yield.Pendle TVL share by assets.

The approval allows yield-bearing stablecoins to operate under specific rules, including registration, disclosure requirements and investor protections.  Moreover, proposed bills like the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) and the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) further signal a favorable direction.Meanwhile, Pendle said it expects stablecoin issuance to double to $500 billion in the next 18 to 24 months.

The platform will be powered by Maia, an AI core engine developed by My Aion, and aims to optimize and manage systems across mobility, energy, education, healthcare and digital services. My Aion CEO Daniele Marinelli said the AI will know the user well enough to “recommend the perfect place for your anniversary dinner and book it for you without you lifting a finger.”The project will debut in Abu Dhabi before expanding internationally. It is expected to launch in 18 months. Multibillion-dollar AI project to create jobs for UAE nationalsThe project is structured under a $2.5 billion Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) model, a public-private partnership model for large-scale infrastructure and technology projects. Under the model, private sector entities construct the infrastructure, run and manage the system for a certain period. The companies usually recoup their investments and earn profits during the operational phase. At the end of the period set by the parties involved, ownership and control of the systems developed through the BOT model are transferred to the government or a public sector entity. Bold Technologies CEO Thani Al Thani Al Falasi said the initiative will support UAE job creation. “This initiative will support job creation for UAE nationals, foster local innovation and contribute meaningfully to the national AI ecosystem,” he said. My Aion’s Marinelli said that relocating to Abu Dhabi provides their global operations with a new chapter. “The UAE offers the infrastructure and institutional support needed to scale responsibly and strategically,” Marinelli said.Cointelegraph has reached out to Bold Technologies and My Aion for more information. Related: Decentralized OORT AI data hits top ranks on Google KaggleCrypto proponents say AI could benefit from digital assetsOn May 20, Catena Labs, a project led by Circle co-founder Sean Neville, announced that it will create an AI-native financial institution.

2025-05-21T08:38:10.000Z,"SEC’s Peirce says NFT royalties do not make tokens securities","United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Hester Peirce said many non-fungible tokens (NFTs), including those with mechanisms to pay creator royalties, likely fall outside the purview of federal securities laws.In a recent speech, Peirce said NFTs that allow artists to earn resale revenue do not automatically qualify as securities. Unlike stocks, NFTs are programmable assets that distribute proceeds to developers or artists. The SEC official said that mirrors how streaming platforms compensate musicians and filmmakers. “Just as streaming platforms pay royalties to the creator of a song or video each time a user plays it, an NFT can enable artists to benefit from the appreciation in the value of their work after its initial sale,” Peirce said. Peirce added that the feature does not provide NFT owners any rights or interest in any business enterprise or profits “traditionally associated with securities.”SEC never prohibited NFT royaltiesOscar Franklin Tan, chief legal officer of Enjin core contributor Atlas Development Services, told Cointelegraph that the recent remarks by Peirce on NFTs and creator royalties have been widely misunderstood. Peirce had clarified that NFTs that send resale royalties to artists are not necessarily securities, a view Tan says is legally sound but mischaracterized in some media reports. “So Hester Peirce said that an NFT that sends royalties back to the creator after a sale is not a security. This is correct, but the way some media reported this is completely out of context,” Tan told Cointelegraph. “The actual context is that this is not controversial, and it was never considered a security.”The lawyer said US securities law focuses on regulating investments and not compensating creators for their work. “The artist or creator is not an investor, not a passive third party in the NFT,” he said, noting that royalty payments are not considered investment income. Instead, Tan told Cointelegraph that this type of earning is “analogous to business income,” which the SEC does not regulate. He added: “The SEC never prohibited contracts where artists and creators get royalties from secondary sales of their work, not royalties from paper contracts or blockchain protocols.”Tan explained that the legal distinction becomes more complicated when NFTs promise shared profits from royalties to multiple holders beyond the original creator. Tan also urged regulators and market participants to apply traditional legal reasoning to new blockchain technologies. “Ask yourself, if this were done by pen and paper instead of blockchain, would there still be a regulatory issue?” he said. “If none, slow down.”Source: Oscar Franklin TanRelated: SEC charges Unicoin crypto platform over alleged $100 million fraudOpenSea calls on the SEC to exempt NFT marketplaces from oversightWhile NFT royalties may not have been a controversial SEC issue, NFT marketplaces are a different case.

The executive said that this was a win for the industry. Following the conclusion of the SEC’s investigation, OpenSea’s lawyers penned a letter to Peirce, who leads the SEC’s Crypto Task Force. OpenSea general counsel Adele Faure and deputy general counsel Laura Brookover said in an April 9 letter that NFT marketplaces don’t qualify as brokers under US securities laws. The lawyers said the marketplaces don’t execute transactions or act as intermediaries.

They will also need to establish internal Donation Review Committees to assess the appropriateness of each donation and the liquidation strategy.To reduce risks of money laundering, all donations must be routed through verified Korean won exchange accounts, with verification responsibilities placed on banks, exchanges and the nonprofits themselves.Furthermore, only cryptocurrencies listed on at least three major domestic exchanges will be eligible, and liquidation is expected to occur immediately upon receipt.Guidelines regarding nonprofits selling crypto donations.

Importantly, exchanges are barred from selling tokens on their own platforms to prevent conflicts of interest.South Korea is also tightening standards for listing digital assets. The revised rules aim to curb instability from sudden price spikes by requiring a minimum circulating supply before a token is allowed to trade and temporarily restricting market orders post-listing.So-called zombie tokens (with low volume and thin market caps) and memecoins without clear utility will face more scrutiny.

2025-05-21T07:35:00.000Z,"Why crypto transfers can fail and what you must check before sending","Why crypto transfers can fail and what you must check before sending              Crypto transfers fail more often than most people realize, but user attentiveness can stop most losses.What’s often marketed as a seamless, borderless system can become frustrating when transfers fail, with no customer service hotline to call and no easy recourse to reverse mistakes. In the crypto universe, the burden of getting it right falls squarely on the shoulders of the user.But here’s the encouraging part: Most failures are preventable. Understanding why crypto transfers fail can help users avoid costly missteps, navigate the quirks of different networks and send funds with far greater confidence. With a little preparation, you can sidestep common pitfalls and take control of your crypto experience.Did you know? According to a recent survey, 37% of people cite security risks as the most significant barrier to adopting crypto for payments, a reminder of how crucial it is to prioritize security at every step.                   Common crypto transfer mistakes              A single slip — wrong address, wrong network or underpaid fee — tops the list of costly crypto-transfer mistakes.Here’s a quick look at common crypto transfer mistakes:Sending crypto to the wrong address: Blockchain transactions are irreversible. A single wrong character in the recipient’s wallet address can send funds into the void, or worse, into a stranger’s wallet.Choosing the wrong network: Sending Tether USDt (USDT) over Ethereum instead of Tron? That’s a classic mistake. Always match the network to your recipient’s supported network.Underpaying gas or fees: Lowballing crypto gas fees, also known as blockchain transaction fees, can leave your transaction stuck or pending indefinitely.Not double-checking wallet compatibility: Some wallets can’t handle certain tokens or blockchains. Always verify.Sending tokens on the wrong network — like Ethereum instead of BNB Chain — can result in permanent loss. One user learned this the hard way (as shown in the image above) after transferring crypto to Coinbase from Binance using an unsupported network.                  Failed crypto transaction explained              Even perfect-looking transactions can crumble if gas is too low, a smart contract glitches or network congestion spikes.A failed crypto transaction can happen even if all the input details seem right. One major reason is insufficient gas fees. If the gas you set is too low, blockchain validators may ignore your transaction entirely. In some cases, this causes the transaction to fail outright; in others, it remains stuck in a pending state for hours or even days.Smart contract hiccups are another hidden landmine, especially in the decentralized finance (DeFi) world. If the contract’s code has flaws or can’t handle your input, your transaction can bounce back. Add in network congestion — especially on high-traffic chains like Ethereum, where every block is a battle for space — and even well-planned transfers can stall or fail without warning.Did You Know? A study analyzing over 1.5 billion failed transactions on the Solana blockchain found that bot spamming and network congestion were significant contributors to transaction failures.                  Crypto transfer troubleshooting guide              A quick five-point checklist (address, network, explorer status, wallet queue, asset support) usually reveals why funds haven’t landed.If your crypto transfer isn’t received, don’t panic. Check these first:Confirm the recipient’s address is correct.Verify the transfer network (was it Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon, etc.).Check the status on a block explorer (like Etherscan for Ethereum or Solscan for Solana).Review your wallet and see if the transfer is still pending.Make sure the recipient wallet supports the asset you sent.If you catch an issue early, some platforms allow you to speed up or cancel a stuck transaction by paying a higher gas fee.What to check before sending cryptoPrevention is your best friend.Before sending any crypto, take a few moments to verify all the critical details. Always double-check the recipient’s wallet address. The safest method is copy-paste; never type it out manually. Ensure that the address belongs to the correct network and is compatible with the token you’re sending.Make sure the address matches the right network and can handle the token you’re sending. And don’t forget the fees. On Ethereum, for example, you’ll need some ETH in your wallet to cover gas or that transfer’s going nowhere. Also, confirm the receiving wallet can accept the token and that you're not hitting any daily or regional transfer limits imposed by the platform.Did You Know? A single copy-paste mistake cost one crypto trader $26 million in Renzo Restaked ETH (ezETH). The tokens were sent to the wrong wallet address, and recovery was impossible, even with white hat hackers trying to help.                  Crypto transfer speed and networks              Different blockchains clear at various speeds, so match your urgency to a network’s typical confirmation time.Chains like Solana, Avalanche and Tron blaze through transactions in seconds, leaving older titans like Bitcoin and Ethereum catching their breath, especially when network traffic spikes and block space gets tight. And they’re not alone. Newer players like Aptos and Sui are also pushing the limits of scale and throughput, signaling a fierce race for speed across the crypto ecosystem.That’s why knowing the average speed of the network you’re using matters. Sending Bitcoin (BTC)? Expect to wait around 10 minutes per confirmation, there are 6 of them. Moving USDT on Solana? It should arrive almost instantly. Being aware of these differences helps set realistic expectations and avoid unnecessary panic when a transfer lags. And when every second counts — whether you’re racing to secure a trade or make a payment — choosing a fast crypto network can save you time and stress.                  How the crypto Travel Rule can cause transfer failures              Regulatory hurdles like the Travel Rule can freeze transfers if sender or recipient data doesn’t line up across jurisdictions.The crypto Travel Rule requires virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to share key details about the sender and recipient when handling transfers above set limits. If that information is missing, incomplete, or doesn’t match up, your transaction can hit a wall, often getting delayed or blocked entirely. This issue pops up frequently in cross-border transfers or when moving funds to exchanges.Other problems arise from the “sunrise issue,” where some countries have adopted the Travel Rule and others haven’t. This mismatch can lead to compliance conflicts and blocked transactions. Self-hosted wallets also present a challenge: Some VASPs won’t process transfers to wallets they can’t verify. As regulations tighten, expect more of these friction points in crypto transfers.Did you know? A report by Cointelegraph Research and Onramper found that 50% of fiat-to-crypto transactions fail, even when users have completed Know Your Customer (KYC) checks. User location, banking restrictions and local regulations all play a role in whether those transactions succeed or collapse.                   How to avoid failed crypto transactions              Send a test amount, watch live gas trackers and never rush. Slow, informed moves keep transactions from failing.Avoiding failed transactions comes down to awareness and caution. First, always test with a small amount before transferring large sums. This gives you a chance to catch mistakes without losing much. Second, always monitor current gas fees, especially on volatile networks like Ethereum. Tools like Etherscan Gas Tracker and Blocknative Gas Estimator give live Ethereum gas prices. Many wallets (like MetaMask) also show gas estimates in the app. Using a reputable crypto wallet that offers real-time fee suggestions and transaction previews helps immensely. Finally, take your time. Many failed transactions happen simply because users are in a rush or feeling pressured to act fast. In crypto, speed can kill your funds.Did you know? One user paid $200 in gas fees on Ethereum for a failed transaction that returned nothing. The cause? Slippage settings were off, and the network still charged full fees.                  How to verify a crypto transfer              Plug the transaction hash into a block explorer for an instant verdict on whether your transfer is pending, confirmed or failed.Once you send crypto, the transaction hash becomes your receipt. Paste it into a block explorer of the chain you used, like Etherscan, Solscan or Tronscan, to get live updates. This will tell you if the transaction is pending, confirmed or failed, along with timestamps, block numbers and fee details.Some wallets and exchanges now offer built-in tracking tools that integrate directly with explorers. These make it easier for beginners to stay informed without needing to navigate third-party websites. If a transfer seems stuck, checking the status this way should always be your first move.                  Mastering crypto transfers: Confidence over chaos              Triple-checking details, monitoring fees and staying curious turns crypto transfers from a gamble into a confident routine. One wrong digit, one wrong network, and your funds could vanish into the void. This isn’t just about saving your wallet; it’s about owning your peace of mind.As blockchains scale and regulations tighten, the winners are those who move smart, not just fast. So here’s the vibe: Slow down to level up. Triple-check that address. Know the platform you’re using. Watch those fees. Stay cool when networks get jammed.The pros don’t rush; they prepare. Back up your keys. Keep your tools sharp. Stay curious and keep learning, because the crypto game rewards those who respect it.Master the flow, and you trade chaos for confidence.

2025-05-21T07:09:02.000Z,"Theta Capital raises $175M to back early-stage blockchain startups","Amsterdam-based Theta Capital Management raised over $175 million for its latest fund-of-funds, aimed at supporting early-stage blockchain startups through specialized venture capital (VC) firms.The new vehicle, Theta Blockchain Ventures IV, will channel capital into crypto-native VC firms with a track record of backing blockchain innovation, Theta’s managing partner and chief investment officer Ruud Smets told Bloomberg.Smets said the strategy focuses on specialist managers who can outperform generalist investors in the earliest funding rounds.“We’ve always been looking for areas where specialization and active management provide a sustainable edge,” Smets noted. He said that the experience and positioning of dedicated crypto VCs “has compounded over time,” creating barriers for less focused investors trying to enter the space.Founded in 2001, Theta shifted its focus to digital assets in 2018 and now manages about $1.2 billion. The firm has backed leading crypto investment names such as Polychain Capital, CoinFund and Castle Island Ventures.Source: Theta CapitalRelated: AI takes nearly 60% of global venture capital dollars in Q1Crypto VC deals reboundThe fund’s close comes as crypto venture capital begins to rebound. According to Galaxy Digital, VC investment in digital assets rose 54% in the first quarter of 2025 to $4.8 billion, signaling renewed confidence in the sector after a prolonged downturn.A report from PitchBook also showed that crypto venture capital funding surged in early 2025, even as deal activity declined.The report showed that 405 VC deals were completed in Q1 2025, a 39.5% drop from the 670 recorded in the same period last year. However, that’s a modest uptick from the 372 deals seen in Q4 2024.Despite fewer deals, total funding more than doubled year-over-year, reaching $6 billion in Q1 compared to $2.6 billion in Q1 2024, also doubling from the previous quarter’s $3 billion.PitchBook’s senior crypto analyst Robert Le noted that even amid macroeconomic uncertainty, “capital continued to seek crypto’s core utility rails.”The bulk of the investment — around $2.55 billion across just 16 deals — went to companies in asset management, trading platforms and crypto financial services. Infrastructure and development firms followed, raising nearly $955 million across 30 deals.Web3-focused companies saw the third-most deals and funding, at 23 and $231.2 million, respectively.
