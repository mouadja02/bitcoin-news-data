2025-05-22T20:49:07.000Z,"Why Did Bitcoin (BTC) Hit a New Record High? Why Are Altcoins Quiet? Analyst Explains Why","Bitcoin hits all-time high, surpassing $111,000 Evaluating the dynamics behind this historic rise, Bitwise Asset Management's Investment Director Matt Hougan stated that the rally has just begun and is a harbinger of a long-term rise. According to Hougan, Bitcoin's rise is driven by two key factors: the increasing interest of institutional investors in the market and indirect support from the US government. “More than $8 billion has flowed into Bitcoin ETFs in the last 30 days. This means new demand against fixed supply and pushes prices up,” Hougan said, adding that the government’s increasing budget deficits and money printing policies have also pushed investors away from fiat currencies, which has increased their focus on Bitcoin. Related News: Following Record Highs in Bitcoin, US Crypto Chief David Sacks Makes Critical Statements Hougan said the rise in long-term government bonds and developments in markets such as Japan suggested investors were losing appetite for borrowing. “The U.S. government is no longer serious about budget cuts. That calls into question the long-term value of the dollar,” he said. Hougan also touched on why this strong performance of Bitcoin was not seen in altcoins, saying that Bitcoin is in a different position as “digital gold.” He said, “Cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Solana should be evaluated more like technology investments,” and stated that it is natural for these assets to perform differently than Bitcoin. Hougan predicts that Bitcoin will reach new records in the coming period. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Why Did Bitcoin (BTC) Hit a New Record High? Why Are Altcoins Quiet?

According to the data, the BSC Foundation purchased $25,000 worth of each of MYX, BANK, LISTA, and GM tokens in five minutes. Although the amounts are small, the symbolic significance of these purchases could be significant. Of the purchased tokens, GM's market value is $8.4 million and MYX's market value is $6.38 million (pre-purchase market values).

2025-05-22T20:33:15.000Z,"Dow Jones seesaws, ends flat as Bitcoin hits new all-time high","U.S. stocks ended mixed Thursday as markets digested the House’s narrow approval of President Trump’s massive tax-and-spending package. The S&P 500 dipped 0.04%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.28%. The legislation—projected by the Congressional Budget Office to add nearly $4 trillion to the federal deficit—includes sweeping tax cuts and increased military spending. It passed the House by a single vote after last-minute revisions, including expanded deductions for state and local taxes, aimed at swaying conservative lawmakers. The bill now heads to the Senate. Another spike in Treasury yields tempered investor sentiment. The 30-year bond briefly rose above 5.16%—its highest level since 2023—before easing. The benchmark 10-year yield also pulled back slightly to 4.55%. Analysts said weak demand at Wednesday’s 20-year bond auction fueled the earlier sell-off in Treasurys, while concerns about debt sustainability persist. “Short term, the tax bill is good for the economy,” said Argent Capital’s Jed Ellerbroek. “But in the longer term, it adds to the deficit, and that’s bad for markets.” You might also like: CFTC’s Mersinger says crypto perpetual futures could trade in U.S. Bitcoin keeps hitting all-time highs Bitcoin ( BTC ) extended its massive rally, trading above $111,000, amid optimism over Senate progress on stablecoin regulation and anticipation surrounding a Trump donor event attended by major crypto holders. Bitcoin’s rally sparked limited excitement among derivatives traders compared to past bull runs.

Speaking on the program, Scaramucci stated that Bitcoin has risen to $ 111,000, and attributed this rise to both investor interest and bipartisan regulatory efforts regarding stablecoins in the US. “Stablecoin laws will help Bitcoin and crypto assets in general to be placed on a more institutional and legal basis,” Scaramucci said, adding that initiatives such as the “Stable Act” and “Genius Act” are particularly noteworthy. According to Scaramucci, stablecoins can be a tool that will support not only the crypto ecosystem but also the global strength of the US dollar. In his statement on this subject, he used the following expressions: “Stablecoins will reduce global transaction costs and greatly benefit those without access to the banking system. In addition, the reserves of these coins are mostly US Treasury bonds. This could strengthen the dollar’s position as a global reserve currency.” Related News: Following Record Highs in Bitcoin, US Crypto Chief David Sacks Makes Critical Statements Scaramucci highlighted that major stablecoin issuers like Tether have a larger holding in US Treasury bonds than countries like Germany or Japan. Anthony Scaramucci also touched on President Donald Trump’s stance on crypto assets. Stating that he finds some of Trump’s deregulation steps positive, Scaramucci also said that “memecoin”-based campaign messages or controversial approaches regarding wallet control create a negative perception in the sector. Scaramucci stated that due to increasing public spending and central bank monetary policies, many investors tend to turn to alternative assets other than the US dollar. Stating that Bitcoin stands out as an attractive store of value due to its limited supply, the investor said, “The unconscious spending of central banks for a long time is now directing investors to more reliable havens.” Scaramucci singled out Circle among the companies he invested in in the stablecoin sector. Describing the company’s founder Jeremy Allaire and his team as “very successful in terms of regulatory compliance,” Scaramucci stated that he has confidence in Circle as one of the leaders in the stablecoin sector. *This is not investment advice.

Mersinger announced that he will be moving to a new role at the Blockchain Association in order to continue to play an active role in regulating the crypto industry. Speaking about the stablecoin regulation expected to pass the Senate, Mersinger said, “The passage of this bill shows that this asset class is now permanent and that the US aims to lead in this area.” He argued that the US could further consolidate its economic power with these new technologies. Mersinger stated that it was a challenging process to make the decision to leave before completing his term, which will last until 2028. However, he expressed that he believes that he can make a more effective contribution to priority issues such as stablecoin law and market structure regulations through his new role at the Blockchain Association. Related News: Altcoin Developers Make a Statement Regarding Today's $224 Million Hack Incident Mersinger argued that the CFTC is in a unique position as a regulator of the crypto spot market. “We already have oversight authority in the futures markets. As the CFTC, we are a market regulator, and that makes us competent,” he said. He also said that the CFTC is a global regulator, so it can effectively oversee international crypto markets as well. CFTC Member Mersinger: “Cryptocurrency Futures Products to Begin Trading Soon” Mersinger, who said that cryptocurrency perpetual futures products may soon start trading in the US, stated that some applications are in the evaluation phase and that these products will soon start trading within the framework of US regulations. “It would be a great gain for the sector if these products return to the US market,” he said. Mersinger, who noted that the CFTC has historically relied on bipartisan cooperation, argued that the agency operates independently of political pressures and that the agency can effectively monitor markets even with a small number of members. While US President Donald Trump’s wealth growth from crypto investments during his re-election campaign has been a source of public debate, Mersinger said these discussions are distracting from the real issues. “What we really need to focus on is having markets operate in a regulated manner in the US.

2025-05-22T20:00:31.000Z,"Bitcoin Rally ‘Remains Robust’ as One BTC Metric Reaches Historic All-Time Highs, According to Glassnode","The latest rally sending Bitcoin ( BTC ) to new all-time highs is showing a lot of strength as one key metric reaches unprecedented levels, according to the digital asset analytics firm Glassnode. Glassnode says that Bitcoin’s Realized Cap, which records the price at which each coin was last moved and aims to gauge how many holders are in profit or at a loss, is hitting a new all-time high. “Strength in the digital asset market remains robust with Bitcoin continuing to consolidate just beneath its all-time high of $109,000. The elevation in price has raised the profitability of the vast majority of market investors, with many seizing the opportunity to lock in profits. As a result, capital inflows have increased markedly, pushing the Realized Cap above $900 billion for the first time, a historic milestone that underscores the depth of liquidity in the market.” Glassnode also says that Short-Term Holders (STHs), those entities that have held their coins for less than 155 days, have sold at massive profits in the last month, while Bitcoin is absorbing the selling pressure. “For the Short-Term Holders, the improvement in their portfolio values has directly translated into a notable increase in spending activity, with the cohort realizing over $11.4 billion of profit across the last month.” Glassnode reports on the social media platform X that ever since Bitcoin plummeted to a local low of around $74,000 in early April, the market value to realized value (MVRV) metric – which gauges the market’s sentiment and valuation of a crypto asset – has soared for both STHs and Long-Term Holders (LTHs). A rising MVRV means “holders are sitting on more unrealized profit – boosting confidence and reducing sell pressure,” according to the analytics firm. “Since the $74,000 low: MVRV: 1.74 to 2.33 (+74% to +133%). STH MVRV: 0.82 to 1.13 (from -18% loss to +13% gain). LTH MVRV: 2.91 to 3.30 (+191% to +230%). Profitability is up across the board, boosting confidence and supporting the rally.” Bitcoin printed a new all-time high Wednesday, briefly breaking past $110,000 for the first time in its history. The top crypto asset has since retraced, trading for $109,686 at time of writing, up 2.6% in the last 24 hours.

2025-05-22T20:00:12.000Z,"Ethereum Consolidates Above $2,500 While BTC Leads the Charge – Key Levels To Watch","Ethereum is gaining momentum as optimism returns to the crypto market. With Bitcoin officially entering price discovery and surging past its all-time highs, attention is turning toward ETH, which is now testing critical resistance levels. Ethereum has gained over 55% since early May, riding the wave of broader market strength and renewed investor confidence. However, despite the impressive recovery, ETH still lags behind Bitcoin’s pace and has yet to reclaim its 2021 highs. Related Reading: Litecoin Eyes $117.50 As Price Rebounds From Key Support – Analyst Top analyst Daan shared a technical view highlighting that Ethereum has been chopping around the $2,400–$2,600 zone since its explosive move earlier this month. This range-bound price action signals indecision, as buyers remain active but haven’t yet triggered a breakout. Daan notes that although Bitcoin is showing strong leadership with its push into new highs, Ethereum’s performance in this phase has been more muted. Still, the setup remains constructive for bulls. The $2,400 level has acted as solid support, while resistance above $2,800 remains the next target to clear for continuation. As Bitcoin continues to lead, ETH could be next in line to surge—if it can escape this range and follow BTC’s lead into a new leg higher. All eyes are now on Ethereum’s next move. Ethereum Prepares For A Breakout As Altcoins Enter The Spotlight As Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high above $111K, the broader crypto market appears to be entering a fresh phase of momentum, one that could drive massive gains across altcoins. Among them, Ethereum remains in a critical position. While ETH hasn’t followed BTC’s breakout just yet, it’s holding firmly above support and showing signs of building strength. To confirm a bullish continuation, ETH needs to break decisively above resistance and lead the altcoin rally. Daan shared a technical view highlighting that ETH has been consolidating between the $2,400 and $2,600 levels since its last squeeze higher. Despite Bitcoin’s explosive move, Ethereum is once again lagging, a dynamic that’s been reflected in a cooling ETH/BTC ratio. This underperformance has sparked debate among traders, with many waiting for ETH to catch up and drive the next altseason. Daan emphasized that the $2,500 zone has been well-defended by bulls, but ETH has yet to produce a convincing breakout. The key resistance level to watch is $2,850—clearing it would mark a technical shift toward higher highs. On the flip side, if ETH falls below $2,100, it could trigger a broader pullback. For now, ETH remains range-bound but poised, with market sentiment growing more optimistic by the day.

After weeks of consolidation in the $2,400–$2,600 range, ETH has pushed toward the upper boundary of this zone, hinting at a possible breakout. The recent bounce from support around $2,450 has been strong, with consecutive green candles and rising volume signaling increasing bullish momentum. The 200-period SMA and EMA, currently at $2,077 and $2,1,99 respectively, are well below the current price, confirming a bullish market structure. ETH has held above both moving averages since early May, and the current price action appears to be building up pressure for a decisive move. Related Reading: Dogecoin Momentum Fades – Analyst Expects $0.213 Retest However, ETH must now break above $2,700 convincingly to confirm a breakout and signal a continuation toward higher resistance at $2,850 and beyond.

A breakout could trigger a rapid move to $3,000, while failure to hold current levels could drag ETH back toward its previous support.

Bitcoin’s breakout failed to usher euphoria among traders and the reaction on derivatives traders was muted, relative to previous BTC price rallies. Ethereum ( ETH ) struggles to attract institutional inflows even as ETH rallies alongside Bitcoin ( BTC ) in its price discovery. Altcoins in the top 50 cryptocurrencies ranked by market capitalization are in the green, rallying in the last 24 hours. Table of Contents Bitcoin derivatives analysis Ethereum technical and derivatives analysis Crypto trader sentiment and why euphoria is missing How high can Bitcoin go? Expert commentary Bitcoin derivatives analysis Analysts at 10xResearch and Amberdata are in agreement on the fact that spot market strength and not speculation, is driving gains in BTC. Bitcoin’s rally beyond $111,000 failed to kick in a euphoria among traders and the long/short ratio across top derivatives exchanges is above 1. While this indicates that traders are bullish on BTC and expect further gains, on previous instances like the 2017 and 2020 cycles, the ratio exceeded 2. The 24-hour liquidation data shows $175 million in shorts liquidations and over $47 million in long positions were liquidated. Bearish traders are being punished for betting against Bitcoin price rally, but the key question is, how high will Bitcoin go?

Crypto trader sentiment and why euphoria is missing The Fear and Greed Index Chart on CoinMarketCap shows that even as Bitcoin enters price discovery, the levels of “Greed” observed in November 2024 were the highest. Trader sentiment is not as euphoric as one might expect, at the time of writing it reads 73. Extreme greed is typically correlated with cycle peaks or yearly tops. Above $110,000 Bitcoin is still lagging in terms of bullish sentiment among traders. This may be a positive sign as it supports the thesis that the cycle top is still away and traders are likely waiting and watching for the next pullback and rally in BTC. Fear and Greed Index chart | Source: CMC How high can Bitcoin go? Bitcoin’s target is the $122,000 level that coincides with the 127.2% Fibonacci retracement of its 50% rally from April 7 low to May 22 peak. BTC is currently less than 10% away from its target and technical indicators on the daily price chart support likelihood of further gains. RSI is sloping upwards and crossed into the “overvalued” zone and MACD flashes consecutive green histogram bars. If Bitcoin tests resistance at $122,000 and breaks past this level, the next target at $127,352 comes into play. The $127,352 target is the 141.4% Fibonacci retracement level for Bitcoin in its ongoing upward trend. While analysts at Bernstein pushed their target for Bitcoin to $200,000 in 2025, it is likely that BTC crosses the $127,000 level before June 2025, based on its gains since April 2025.

Exchanges like Binance and Bybit have seen “heavy open interest entries that trap shorts and attract fresh longs,” in this zone. Bitcoin pushed above resistance between the $105,000 and $106,000 level early on Thursday. It remains to be seen how long Bitcoin holds above the FVGs on the daily timeframe. Bitfinex analysts told Crypto.news in a written note that the team is watching minor liquidity walls between $114,000 and $118,000 and the $123,000 to $125,000 zone is where large options open interest is building.

In a new strategy session, crypto trader Kevin Svenson tells his 83,200 YouTube subscribers that the top crypto asset by market cap’s latest upward shift confirms that it’s going to continue climbing until the end of this week, bringing BTC’s price to at least $115,000. “This run could be finishing around the end of May 23rd or May 24th, that may be when we actually get to $115,000, so really just a three-day run just like [previously]. I mean I don’t see a reason why this can’t happen. Usually, when you break the all-time high, there’s a lot of momentum, there’s a lot of excitement, and prices move very quickly. So seeing Bitcoin at 115,000 around May 23rd or May 24th would be no surprise at all now.” However, Svenson cautions traders not to take his prediction as meaning that the flagship digital asset is guaranteed to lose steam at $115,000, as he says it could shoot up to $124,000 by July. “Even though I’m saying that we might stall at $115,000, that does not mean that the run would be over at $115,000. We might just get some chop consolidation and then ultimately run up towards my parabolic trend target of $124,000 – that’s where I think we might actually be by the time that July rolls around.” Bitcoin is trading for $111,322 at time of writing, a 2.1% increase during the last 24 hours.

2025-05-22T19:48:06.000Z,"Huge Whales Are Highly Active: Here Are Their Transactions, Altcoins Bought and Sold Today","Large-scale transactions made by whales and institutional investors in the cryptocurrency market today attracted attention. Here are the prominent transactions of the day: On April 27, a mystery whale purchased 30,000 Ethereum (ETH) via over-the-counter transactions for a total of $54.9 million at $1,830. The same whale also purchased 600 Bitcoin (BTC), paying $56.94 million for the transaction. Just three hours ago, the same whale sold 30,000 ETH at $2,621, making $78.63 million and a net profit of $23.73 million. The remaining 600 BTC are still unsold, currently worth $66.5 million and currently showing a profit of $9.6 million. DWF Labs, one of the active market makers in the market, deposited 25.77 million ASTR tokens (approximately $802,000) into staking by withdrawing them to its on-chain staking wallet.

The same wallet spent $3.8 million this time by buying 1,425 ETH at an average price of $2,670. With this move, the whale wallet lost approximately $2.67 million by selling at the wrong time. Two wallets believed to be affiliated with Abraxas Capital (0xB83D and 0x5b5d) opened short positions for BTC, ETH, and SOL on the Hyperliquid platform.

2025-05-22T19:40:13.000Z,"Altcoin Season: Explosive Opportunity Predicted After Bitcoin Halving","BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season: Explosive Opportunity Predicted After Bitcoin Halving The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with anticipation. Could we be on the verge of the most significant surge in altcoin prices we’ve ever seen? That’s the exciting possibility being discussed following a notable altcoin prediction from analyst Wimar.X. According to reports from BeInCrypto, Wimar.X suggests that the conditions are aligning for an altcoin season of unprecedented scale, potentially kicking off as early as May 25. Why is May 25 a Potential Trigger for Altcoin Season? This specific date isn’t pulled out of thin air. Wimar.X’s analysis is rooted in historical patterns observed in the crypto market , particularly those following Bitcoin halving events. The halving, a programmed reduction in the rate at which new Bitcoin is created, has historically acted as a catalyst for significant market movements. While Bitcoin often sees a rally leading up to or shortly after the halving, the subsequent phase frequently involves capital rotating from Bitcoin into altcoins, fueling their growth. The theory is that after Bitcoin’s price has seen substantial appreciation, investors look for opportunities elsewhere in the market where potential percentage gains might be higher. This search for value often leads them to altcoins – cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. Here’s a simplified look at the typical post-halving market cycle phases: Phase 1: Pre-Halving Rally: Bitcoin’s price tends to rise as anticipation builds. Phase 2: Post-Halving Consolidation/Initial Dip: Sometimes a ‘sell the news’ event or a period of sideways movement occurs. Phase 3: Bitcoin Parabolic Run: Bitcoin experiences a major price surge, often reaching new all-time highs. Phase 4: Altcoin Season: Capital flows from Bitcoin into altcoins, causing many to outperform BTC significantly. Phase 5: Market Peak & Correction: The overall market peaks, followed by a significant downturn. Wimar.X’s prediction suggests we are nearing the transition from Phase 3 or an early stage of Phase 4, where the environment becomes ripe for altcoins to shine. Understanding the Role of BTC Dominance in Altcoin Season A key indicator supporting the potential for an altcoin season is BTC dominance . What is it? BTC dominance refers to Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies. It’s expressed as a percentage. BTC Dominance = (Bitcoin Market Cap / Total Crypto Market Cap) * 100% When BTC dominance is high, it means a large portion of the total value in the crypto market is held in Bitcoin. This often happens during bear markets (when investors flock to the perceived safety of BTC) or during strong Bitcoin-led rallies. Conversely, when BTC dominance falls, it indicates that altcoins are gaining market share relative to Bitcoin. This is the hallmark of an altcoin season . As capital rotates from BTC into various altcoins, Bitcoin’s percentage of the total market cap decreases, even if Bitcoin’s price isn’t necessarily falling (it might just be growing slower than altcoins, or staying stable while altcoins rise). Wimar.X specifically points out that BTC dominance has recently seen a new all-time high relative to the current market structure and is now showing signs of falling. This decline after a peak is historically a strong precursor to significant altcoin rallies. It signals that investors are beginning to diversify away from their primary Bitcoin holdings into the broader altcoin landscape. What Does a Potential Explosive Altcoin Season Mean for You? If Wimar.X’s altcoin prediction holds true, an explosive altcoin season presents significant opportunities for investors. Historically, during these periods, many altcoins have seen gains far exceeding those of Bitcoin, with some experiencing parabolic price increases. Potential Benefits: Higher Percentage Gains: Altcoins, especially those with smaller market caps, have the potential for exponential growth during a season. Portfolio Diversification: Investing in a range of altcoins across different sectors (DeFi, NFTs, Layer 2s, etc.) can diversify your crypto holdings beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. Early Adoption Potential: Identifying promising altcoins early in their growth cycle can lead to substantial long-term returns. Potential Challenges & Risks: Increased Volatility: Altcoins are generally more volatile than Bitcoin. Prices can rise and fall dramatically in short periods. Risk of Failure: Many altcoin projects do not succeed. Identifying legitimate projects amidst hype is crucial and difficult. Liquidity Issues: Some smaller altcoins may have low trading volume, making it difficult to buy or sell large positions without impacting the price. Scams and Rug Pulls: The altcoin space is unfortunately rife with fraudulent projects designed to steal investor funds. Current Market Signals and Historical Context While the Altcoin Season Index (an index tracking whether 75% of the top 50 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days) currently remains low, this isn’t necessarily contradictory to the prediction. A low index simply reflects the recent past performance, which has been dominated by Bitcoin’s strength. The prediction is forward-looking, based on the expectation of a shift. Furthermore, historical data shows that the second quarter (Q2) of the year has often been a strong period for the crypto market , including altcoins. Combining this historical Q2 strength with the post- Bitcoin halving cycle dynamics and the observed fall in BTC dominance creates a compelling argument for the potential timing of the predicted altcoin season . Actionable Insights: Preparing for a Potential Altcoin Surge If you believe an explosive altcoin season is on the horizon, how can you position yourself? Here are some actionable steps: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): This is paramount. Don’t invest based solely on hype. Research projects’ fundamentals, technology, team, tokenomics, and community. Identify Promising Sectors: Look into areas of the crypto market showing innovation and growth potential (e.g., specific Layer 2 solutions, DePIN projects, AI-related tokens, specific DeFi protocols). Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across multiple promising altcoins and sectors. Consider Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Set stop-loss orders to limit potential downside. Have an exit strategy – know when you plan to take profits. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of investing a lump sum, consider investing a fixed amount at regular intervals to average out your purchase price. Monitor Key Indicators: Keep an eye on BTC dominance , the Altcoin Season Index, overall market sentiment, and news developments. Secure Your Assets: Use reputable exchanges and consider hardware wallets for storing your cryptocurrencies, especially if you accumulate a significant amount. Remember, this is an altcoin prediction based on historical trends and current indicators. The crypto market is inherently unpredictable, and there are no guarantees. Concluding Thoughts: Navigating the Potential Altcoin Wave The prospect of the largest altcoin season in history beginning around May 25 is undoubtedly exciting for anyone involved in the crypto market . The confluence of the post- Bitcoin halving cycle, the observed decline in BTC dominance , and historical Q2 strength provides a compelling narrative for this potential surge. While the analyst Wimar.X’s altcoin prediction offers a specific timeframe, the underlying market dynamics suggest that conditions are becoming favorable for altcoins to potentially outperform Bitcoin. However, with great potential comes great risk. An explosive altcoin season is also a period of heightened volatility and increased exposure to less established assets. Approaching this period with a well-researched strategy, a diversified portfolio, and robust risk management is essential. Whether the exact date is May 25 or slightly later, the signs are pointing towards a potentially significant shift in market dynamics that could favor altcoins in the coming months.

2025-05-22T19:40:02.000Z,"Democrats propose crypto ban for politicians, protest outside Trump’s memecoin gala","Just hours before President Donald Trump’s high-profile gala for holders of his memecoin, Democratic lawmakers moved to curb what they call rising “crypto corruption” in Washington. Led by Rep. Maxine Waters, 15 House Democrats introduced the “Stop Trading, Retention, and Unfair Market Payoffs in Crypto Act of 2025.” The bill would prohibit the president, vice president, members of Congress, and their immediate families from owning, promoting, or profiting from digital assets while in office. Lawmakers would also be barred from holding crypto assets in ways that allow them to exert unilateral control over the tokens. “Trump’s crypto con is not just a scam to target investors,” Waters said in a statement. “It’s also a dangerous backdoor for selling influence over American policies to the highest foreign bidder.” The legislation arrives amid a wave of criticism surrounding Trump’s deepening ties to crypto. The president and his wife, Melania, recently launched personal memecoins. Trump’s family has also backed a stablecoin through the crypto firm World Liberty Financial, and his sons are linked to a Bitcoin mining venture. Blockchain records indicate that Justin Sun, founder of Tron and a Chinese national, is one of the largest holders of TRUMP ( TRUMP ) — the memecoin that serves as a ticket to Thursday night’s dinner.

Critics, including Sen. Richard Blumenthal, accuse Trump of “auctioning” access to the White House and potentially violating the Constitution’s ban on foreign gifts. Protests are happening outside the event. Senators Chris Murphy, Elizabeth Warren, and Jeff Merkley, along with Rep. Sam Liccardo and advocacy groups, are calling out Donald Trump’s upcoming “meme coin” fundraising dinner as a threat to national security and a potential corruption risk, according to a note shared with crypto.news. At a press conference today, the group demanded the release of attendee names and any promised favors. Murphy also promoted his recently introduced MEME Act, aimed at curbing digital asset profiteering by public officials.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) rally to its all-time high of $111,970 was likely fueled by leverage. On Thursday, May 22, open interest on Bitcoin futures across crypto exchanges reached $80.91 billion , the highest level ever recorded. Exchange BTC futures open interest | Source: CoinGlass On Binance, the largest exchange by volume of derivative contracts, open interest climbed to $13.60 billion. This is the highest level the metric has reached since December 2024. At the same time, the rally contributed to a spike in liquidations , wiping out a total of $246 million in long and short positions across major crypto assets. You might also like: Strategy stock continues to stall despite Bitcoin’s surge to record high The increase in open interest closely tracked Bitcoin’s price, which rose 8.46% since the start of the week. During that same period, open interest increased by 23%, a significantly higher rate than Bitcoin’s price. This suggests that the rally is being driven by leverage rather than retail interest. Institutions and retail are driving Bitcoin’s growth Adding to this narrative is the fact has not seen a significant spike in search interest for Bitcoin. Google Trends reveals a significant decline in search interest for the keyword Bitcoin since November. Specifically, Bitcoin search volume score was at 22, compared to 100 in May 2021, when BTC lost 50% of its value in a matter of weeks. Even during the November rally, Bitcoin’s search volume score peaked at just 64. This suggests that despite Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. elections, retail investors are not as engaged as they were during the 2021 crash. The most likely explanation is that institutional investors are increasingly betting on Bitcoin. Notably, Trump’s election win and subsequent pro-crypto stance have helped legitimize Bitcoin among institutional players—credibility it previously lacked. Read more: Missed the $10k to $100k ride?

Psy (formerly QED Protocol) has developed a trustless bridge connecting Dogecoin to the Solana blockchain. This innovation brings proof-of-work security to Solana while making Dogecoin, the world’s largest memecoin, available to Solana’s ecosystem of dapps. This innovation allows Solana and Dogecoin to directly ‘speak’ to each other, with each blockchain able to independently verify the other’s transactions and consensus without requiring trust in third parties. The bridge not only enhances security but also creates substantial ecosystem opportunities. Bringing Dogecoin’s $36B+ market cap and massive community to Solana opens new possibilities for both networks. Dogecoin users gain access to Solana’s DeFi, NFT, and gaming applications, while Solana developers can tap into Dogecoin’s extensive user base. Unlike traditional bridges, which often rely on multisig signers or custodians, Psy’s next-generation proof-of-work technology validates Dogecoin Proof of Work consensus directly on Solana. This trust-minimized approach helps address a major weakness in crypto infrastructure: bridge hacks, which have caused more than $2.8 billion in losses to date. This positions Psy as the leading proof-of-work innovator for Solana, bridging the security benefits of proof-of-work with Solana’s speed and programmability. This integration demonstrates that new proof-of-work chains, like Psy’s, can interact with high-performance blockchains without sacrificing security or requiring centralized intermediaries. This bridge continues Psy Protocol’s mission to empower developers to build hyper-scalable web3 applications to host the next generation of the decentralized internet. The bridge supports standard Dogecoin wallets and exchange deposits. Quotes “We have been working hard to find ways to better serve the Doge community, and now we get the chance to offer them even greater utility for their Dogecoin,” Carter Feldman, CEO of Psy Protocol, said. “This demonstrates the promise of combining best-in-class security with user demand and an established developer base.” “We’re thrilled to announce the DOGE bridge to Solana, a big step in welcoming one of crypto’s most iconic communities to the Solana ecosystem,” said Lily Liu, President of the Solana Foundation. “DOGE, Bitcoin’s beloved pet, embodies the fun, irreverent spirit that drives on-chain culture. By bridging DOGE into Solana’s network, we’re inviting the Dogecoin community—and all OG crypto enthusiasts—to join us in marrying on-chain culture and decentralized finance.” “Trustless verification has always been the holy grail of interoperability, but achieving it at scale has remained elusive,” said Robinson Burkey, co-founder of Wormhole. “Seeing Psy and Wormhole come together to build this around an asset like DOGE captures the true cyberpunk spirit of crypto. We’re excited to help bring a $36B asset to Solana—soon to be powered by Wormhole.” How the Bridge Works The bridge captures and verifies each Dogecoin block header on Solana. Block headers contain essential blockchain data, including the previous block hash, timestamp, difficulty target, the Merkle root of all transactions in the block, and the Proof of Work consensus algorithm. By verifying these headers directly on Solana, the system cryptographically confirms the validity of Dogecoin transactions without intermediaries. When users send DOGE to the bridge, the system verifies the deposit on the Dogecoin blockchain and mints an equivalent amount of QDOGE tokens on Solana. To convert back, QDOGE tokens are burned on Solana, with withdrawal messages securely transmitted through Wormhole’s cross-chain messaging protocol, triggering the release of the original DOGE to the user’s Dogecoin address. To enable this bridge, Psy has created a suite of infrastructure for developers: txindex: a fully-featured indexer for Dogecoin with effortless handling of forking behavior electrs-doge: the first open-source block explorer for Dogecoin doge-sdk: the first JavaScript SDK for Dogecoin forkr: an easy-to-use tool for simulating forks/re-orgs on Bitcoin and Dogecoin.

2025-05-22T19:16:33.000Z,"BlockTrust IRA Brings Quant Trading Tools to Crypto Retirement Accounts","As spot bitcoin BTC exchange-traded funds continue to grow and Wall Street wades deeper into crypto, more and more people are able to gain exposure to digital assets through their individual retirement accounts (IRAs). IRAs offer tax advantages and a range of investment options, including stocks, real estate, commodities and, increasingly, cryptocurrencies. But when it comes to crypto, there’s usually only one investment strategy available: to buy and hold. It’s a strategy that might work well for assets like the S&P 500, which have long track records of steadily appreciating over longer time frames, but bitcoin is still an extremely volatile asset and other coins even more so. The idea behind BlockTrust IRA, then, is simple: to manage the crypto positions of its customers in order to take advantage of that volatility and maximize their returns. “We're the only company that has an AI tool meshed with traders that put people automatically in cash [when need be]. Then we wait for the right signals, and we buy back in,” Jonathan Rose, the firm’s CEO, told CoinDesk in an interview. “Where people are scared of volatility and scared of risk, we actually want the volatility and the risk associated with that, because that's how we actually make our clients money,” Rose said. “We are right a lot more than we are wrong, and that's how we're able to beat the benchmark.” BlockTrust’s secret sauce? Animus Technologies, a fund that provides intelligent asset management solutions for crypto. Animus has servers around the world and quantifies humongous amounts of data — to the point that a European government body has reached out to inquire what exactly they’re quantifying data for, according to Rose. Animus typically only shares its signals with high net-worth individuals and fund clients, Rose said. In other words, crypto retail participants may now benefit, through their BlockTrust accounts, from the kind of trading mechanisms that previously were only available to quant funds. The sophisticated strategies are currently only available for bitcoin BTC and ether ETH, but BlockTrust offers exposure to 60 different cryptocurrencies, Rose said. Users of the platform can invest as little as $1,000 for non-managed accounts, or $25,000 if they want a managed account — and trading fees can go as low as 0.4% for the former and 0.14% for the latter. BlockTrust IRA went live officially in February. In March, the firm had accrued $10 million in assets, and Rose expects it to bring in roughly $100 million before the end of the year. The company’s early success may also be due to the fact that it’s not just open to U.S. residents, but to people all around the world, as long as they can pass its Know-Your-Customer (KYC) checks. Americans do have the added advantage of being able to use their tax-deferred retirement savings to gain exposure. Crypto markets are ever changing, and trading strategies that function perfectly for a long time may suddenly become outdated due to shifts in the economic environment or crypto-intrinsic changes — potentially threatening to render Animus’ approach obsolete someday. But Rose isn’t concerned. “When [the people at] Animus Technologies go to these hedge fund conferences and speak, they always come back with a big grin on their faces, because they're like, ‘We are so light-years ahead of anyone remotely doing what we're doing,’” Rose said. “It's going to take like four to six years for people to even kind of catch up to us.”",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/22/blocktrust-ira-brings-quant-trading-tools-to-crypto-retirement-accounts,"BTC|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Ether|Bitcoin IRA|Exclusive|News",cryptocompare

By bridging DOGE into Solana’s network, we’re inviting the Dogecoin community—and all OG crypto enthusiasts—to join us in marrying on-chain culture and decentralized finance.” \""Trustless verification has always been the holy grail of interoperability, but achieving it at scale has remained elusive,” said Robinson Burkey, co-founder of Wormhole. “Seeing Psy and Wormhole come together to build this around an asset like DOGE captures the true cyberpunk spirit of crypto. We’re excited to help bring a $36B asset to Solana—soon to be powered by Wormhole.\"" How the Bridge Works The bridge captures and verifies each Dogecoin block header on Solana. Block headers contain essential blockchain data, including the previous block hash, timestamp, difficulty target, the Merkle root of all transactions in the block, and the Proof of Work consensus algorithm. By verifying these headers directly on Solana, the system cryptographically confirms the validity of Dogecoin transactions without intermediaries. When users send DOGE to the bridge, the system verifies the deposit on the Dogecoin blockchain and mints an equivalent amount of QDOGE tokens on Solana. To convert back, QDOGE tokens are burned on Solana, with withdrawal messages securely transmitted through Wormhole’s cross-chain messaging protocol, triggering the release of the original DOGE to the user's Dogecoin address. To enable this bridge, Psy has created a suite of infrastructure for developers: txindex: a fully-featured indexer for Dogecoin with effortless handling of forking behavior electrs-doge: the first open-source block explorer for Dogecoin doge-sdk: the first JavaScript SDK for Dogecoin forkr: an easy-to-use tool for simulating forks/re-orgs on Bitcoin and Dogecoin. About Psy Protocol Psy is the leading innovator in next-generation proof-of-work technology, on a mission to restore the security and decentralization principles of blockchain while enabling modern scalability. Psy is bridging the utility gap between Proof of Work and Proof of Stake chains, empowering developers to build hyper-scalable web3 applications, to provide a credible alternative to a centralized internet controlled by a handful of tech monopolies.

2025-05-22T19:10:56.000Z,"Binance Lawsuit UK: Court Delivers Massive Blow to $13.3B Bitcoin SV Claim","BitcoinWorld Binance Lawsuit UK: Court Delivers Massive Blow to $13.3B Bitcoin SV Claim Imagine a lawsuit demanding a staggering $13.3 billion! That was the situation facing one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance, stemming from its decision regarding Bitcoin SV (BSV). However, a recent ruling by the UK Court of Appeal has dramatically shifted the landscape, delivering a significant blow to the claimants seeking this massive sum. What Was the Massive Binance Lawsuit UK All About? At its core, this legal battle revolved around the decision by Binance and other exchanges to delist Bitcoin SV (BSV) back in 2019. The claimants argued that this delisting severely hampered BSV’s potential for growth and development, causing immense financial damage. They calculated these alleged losses, primarily based on what BSV’s value *could* have become, reaching the eye-watering figure of $13.3 billion. The lawsuit contended that by removing BSV from their platforms, the exchanges acted anti-competitively, stifling innovation and preventing BSV from reaching its true market potential. This potential, according to the claimants, was worth billions. Why Did the UK Court Dismiss the Bulk of the Bitcoin SV Lawsuit ? The UK Court of Appeal’s decision hinged on the nature of the damages being claimed. The judges found the vast majority of the $13.3 billion claim to be highly speculative. Here’s a breakdown of the court’s key points: Speculative Damages: The court determined that claims based on the lost potential future growth of a cryptocurrency like BSV are inherently speculative. Predicting how a digital asset’s value would have evolved over several years, absent a specific event, is incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to quantify with certainty. Lack of Supporting Evidence: The court felt the $13.3 billion figure was not adequately supported by concrete evidence demonstrating a direct, quantifiable link between the delisting and such a massive loss in potential value. Excessive and Unsupported: The sheer scale of the damages sought was deemed excessive and lacking a robust foundation in established legal principles for calculating losses. In essence, the court drew a clear line: while actual, demonstrable losses might be considered, hypothetical future gains based on market speculation are not a valid basis for such substantial damage claims in a legal setting. What Does This Crypto Court Case Mean for Future Legal Battles? This ruling is significant for the wider cryptocurrency industry and sets a potential precedent. It signals that courts, at least in the UK, may be hesitant to entertain large damage claims that are primarily based on speculative future market performance rather than actual, measurable losses. For exchanges and crypto platforms, this offers some degree of protection against potentially crippling lawsuits based on highly uncertain future valuations. It reinforces the challenge claimants face in proving direct causation and quantifying damages in the volatile and unpredictable crypto market. For investors and projects, it highlights the legal complexities of seeking redress for actions perceived to harm a digital asset’s potential. While legal avenues exist, claims must be grounded in provable harm, not just theoretical future profits. The Binance BSV Connection: What Claims Remain? While the bulk of the lawsuit was dismissed, the court did leave the door open for smaller claims to potentially proceed. These remaining claims are understood to relate to actual, provable losses incurred by individuals or entities directly as a result of the delisting. This could include losses related to the immediate inability to trade BSV on a major platform or other direct, non-speculative financial impacts. This distinction is crucial: the court is not saying that delisting events can never lead to legitimate claims, but rather that claims for massive, speculative lost *future* growth are unlikely to succeed. Navigating UK Crypto Regulation : The Broader Context This case unfolds within a global landscape of increasing scrutiny and evolving legal frameworks for cryptocurrencies. The UK, like many jurisdictions, is grappling with how to regulate digital assets and activities effectively. Court cases like this one play a vital role in shaping the legal understanding and application of existing laws to the unique characteristics of the crypto market. The ruling provides clarity on how UK courts might approach damage calculations in crypto disputes, particularly those involving claims of lost potential. As the regulatory environment matures, we can expect more legal challenges and court decisions that will continue to define the boundaries and responsibilities within the crypto space. Key Takeaways from the Ruling: Speculative Damages Rejected: Courts are wary of claims based purely on hypothetical future crypto price increases. Proof is Paramount: Claimants must demonstrate actual, quantifiable losses, not just potential ones. Precedent Set: This ruling could influence how similar crypto lawsuits are handled in the UK and potentially elsewhere. Focus Shifts: Any remaining claims will likely focus on direct, provable losses from the delisting itself. Challenges: Quantifying damages in the volatile crypto market remains a significant legal hurdle. Insights: The legal system is slowly but surely developing precedents for handling complex crypto disputes. In conclusion, the UK Court of Appeal’s decision to dismiss the majority of the $13.3 billion Bitcoin SV lawsuit against Binance marks a pivotal moment. It underscores the legal system’s cautious approach to highly speculative damage claims in the cryptocurrency space and provides valuable insight into the developing landscape of UK crypto regulation . While the case may not be entirely over, the court’s stance on the massive, speculative claim sends a clear message about the type of evidence and arguments required in such a significant crypto court case .

2025-05-22T18:55:02.000Z,"US Dollar Faces Crucial Headwinds: BofA Warns on Fiscal Policy & Currency Accords","BitcoinWorld US Dollar Faces Crucial Headwinds: BofA Warns on Fiscal Policy & Currency Accords The strength or weakness of the US dollar is a major force in the global financial system, impacting everything from commodity prices to international trade, and yes, even the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. When the world’s reserve currency faces challenges, investors across all asset classes pay attention. Bank of America (BofA) recently issued a notable warning, highlighting significant US dollar headwinds stemming from two key areas: US fiscal policy and evolving international currency accords. Understanding US Dollar Headwinds What exactly does it mean for a currency to face ‘headwinds’? In simple terms, it refers to factors or forces that are likely to impede its strength or cause it to depreciate against other currencies. BofA’s analysis suggests that structural issues within the US economy and shifts in the global financial landscape are creating persistent pressures against the dollar. These headwinds aren’t just short-term fluctuations. According to BofA, they represent more fundamental shifts that could influence the dollar’s trajectory over the medium to long term. This perspective is crucial for anyone involved in the forex market analysis or making international investment decisions. Fiscal Policy Impact on the US Dollar One of the primary drivers of the projected US dollar headwinds , according to BofA, is the current state and trajectory of US fiscal policy. Fiscal policy involves the government’s decisions about spending and taxation. When a government spends more than it takes in through taxes, it runs a budget deficit, which adds to the national debt. BofA points to several aspects of US fiscal policy contributing to dollar weakness: Large and Growing Deficits: Persistent large budget deficits can raise concerns about the government’s ability to manage its finances. This can erode confidence in the currency. Rising National Debt: As deficits accumulate, the national debt grows. A high and increasing debt level can be seen as a long-term liability, potentially leading to inflationary pressures if the central bank were ever pressured to monetize the debt. Inflationary Risks: While the link is complex, significant government spending, especially when not matched by production increases, can contribute to inflationary pressures. Inflation erodes the purchasing power of a currency, making it less attractive. The market’s perception of fiscal responsibility (or lack thereof) directly influences investor confidence in the dollar. If investors believe that deficits are unsustainable or will lead to inflation, they may seek safer or higher-yielding assets elsewhere, putting downward pressure on the dollar. The Role of Currency Accords and Global Shifts Beyond domestic fiscal issues, BofA also highlights the impact of evolving international dynamics, specifically mentioning currency agreements or accords. This refers to various ways countries are interacting regarding currency use and trade settlements. Several trends fall under this umbrella: Bilateral Currency Swaps: More countries are entering into agreements to trade directly in their own currencies, bypassing the need to use the US dollar as an intermediary. Dedollarization Efforts: Some nations and blocs are actively seeking to reduce their reliance on the US dollar for trade, reserves, and investments, often motivated by geopolitical factors or a desire for greater financial autonomy. Rise of Alternative Payment Systems: The development of non-dollar-based international payment systems offers alternatives to traditional dollar-centric mechanisms. Increased Use of Other Currencies: While the dollar remains dominant, there’s a gradual, albeit slow, increase in the use of other major currencies (like the Euro or Chinese Yuan) in international transactions and reserves. These shifts, collectively, represent a gradual erosion of the dollar’s unchallenged dominance in global finance. While it’s unlikely to be dethroned overnight, the increasing willingness and ability of countries to operate outside the dollar system create structural US dollar headwinds over time. BofA Forecast and Forex Market Analysis Putting these factors together, BofA’s outlook, or BofA forecast , suggests a less favorable environment for the US dollar compared to recent years. Their analysis likely incorporates how these fiscal and international dynamics interact with other factors like interest rate differentials, economic growth prospects, and geopolitical risks. For participants in the forex market analysis , BofA’s view implies that simply relying on traditional drivers like interest rate hikes might not be sufficient to guarantee dollar strength. The structural issues highlighted by BofA could act as persistent drags. A detailed BofA forecast would likely include specific price targets or ranges for major currency pairs (like EUR/USD, USD/JPY, etc.) based on their assessment of these headwinds. While specific numbers can change, the underlying message is a cautionary one for dollar bulls. Navigating Potential Challenges If BofA’s assessment of US dollar headwinds proves accurate, what are the potential implications and challenges? Inflation Concerns: Persistent deficits and potential debt issues could fuel long-term inflation expectations. Higher Borrowing Costs: If confidence in US debt wanes, the government might have to pay higher interest rates to borrow money. Shift in Global Power Dynamics: A weaker dollar could reflect and contribute to shifts in global economic and political influence. Impact on Asset Prices: A weaker dollar can make US exports cheaper but imports more expensive. It can also influence the flow of international capital and the relative attractiveness of different asset classes, including cryptocurrencies, which sometimes react inversely to dollar strength. Actionable Insights for Investors Considering the potential US dollar headwinds flagged by BofA, what steps might investors consider? It’s important to remember that this is one bank’s view, and market outcomes are never certain. However, incorporating this perspective into your investment thinking can be valuable. Diversification: Ensure your portfolio isn’t overly exposed to US dollar-denominated assets if you are concerned about its potential depreciation. Monitor Fiscal Policy: Keep an eye on US government spending, taxation, and debt levels. Changes in policy or market reaction to policy can be significant drivers. Watch Global Currency Trends: Pay attention to developments in international currency accords, the rise of alternative payment systems, and the use of other currencies in trade and reserves. Consider Forex Exposure: If you have international investments or expenses, understand your exposure to currency fluctuations and consider hedging strategies if appropriate. Assess Crypto’s Role: While crypto’s relationship with the dollar is complex, some view assets like Bitcoin as a potential hedge against traditional currency weakness or inflation, though this is a debated topic with significant risks. Conducting thorough forex market analysis and understanding the factors influencing major currencies like the dollar is vital for informed decision-making in the current global economic climate. Conclusion: BofA’s Cautionary Note Bank of America’s warning about US dollar headwinds from fiscal policy and currency accords serves as a crucial reminder that the dollar’s status is not immutable. While it remains the world’s dominant currency, structural domestic issues and evolving international dynamics are creating challenges. The BofA forecast suggests these factors warrant careful consideration by anyone with exposure to the dollar or the global financial markets. Staying informed about these macro trends is essential for navigating the complexities of the forex market analysis and making sound investment choices in an increasingly interconnected world.

After briefly dropping to $160 from $184, Solana (SOL) is attempting to reclaim a position above its key resistance at $180 for a second consecutive week. With Bitcoin (BTC) hitting an all-time high, market speculators are banking on eventual capital rotation, which could pump major altcoins like SOL toward new highs. Solana shows promising signs on the daily chart, forming a textbook bull flag pattern after a strong uptrend.

Solana 1-day chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The trend remains bullish, supported by the relative strength index (RSI) at 64.30, indicating healthy momentum without overbought conditions. However, SOL needs a clear market structure break (MSB) or a decisive bullish breakout above $180 to trigger the next leg of the rally. Declining volumes during the consolidation phase suggest caution, as a lack of buying pressure could stall the breakout. If SOL fails to breach $180, the immediate key area of interest is between $140-150, and the bull flag pattern would be invalidated.

Analysts Reveal End Of Year Predictions","XRP price forecasts have taken a dramatic turn as bold predictions surface, suggesting that the cryptocurrency could be on the verge of a parabolic 64,000% rally to $1,700. Analysts backing this ambitious forecast point to historical price patterns and XRP’s current technical structure as the basis for their end-of-the-year predictions. A chart shared by crypto analyst The Real Remi Relief on X (formerly Twitter) shows that XRP is mirroring a technical pattern that preceded its 2017-2018 historical bull run — one that saw the third largest cryptocurrency skyrocket by tens of thousands of percent in just a few months. Now that this historical pattern is unfolding, the analyst has confirmed that a breakout is on the horizon for XRP, with projections pointing toward a potential price target as high as $1,700. XRP Price End Of Year Forecast The chart shows two distinct consolidation phases in XRP’s price action — the first spanning from 2014 to 2017 and the second lasting from 2018 until early 2024. During both periods, the cryptocurrency underwent a long-term compression under a descending resistance line. This compression was followed by a breakout, retest, and vertical price expansion. Related Reading: XRP Moves Into Key Range Against Bitcoin As 3 Major Targets Show Up Notably, this breakout in 2017 led to XRP reaching its historical all-time high of $3.84 — a level it hasn’t revisited for over six years. Earlier this year, XRP experienced a similar breakout that pushed it above the multi-year downtrend. The current chart shows that the cryptocurrency’s retest is holding steady, and this pattern has previously preceded massive rallies during the past bull cycles. As a result, Real Remi Relief argues that history is on the verge of repeating itself. According to his end-of-year forecast for XRP, the cryptocurrency is poised for a staggering 64,000% rally, placing its price at a jaw-dropping $1,700 per token by as early as Q4 2025 or Q1 2026. While the timeline could extend into the following year, the outlook still frames 2025 as a bullish turning point for XRP, with strong potential for the altcoin to close the year in a strong green. Interestingly, the crypto expert has also shared a more conservative target, predicting that XRP could record a still ambitious, but more realistic surge to $1,200 by year’s end. XRP Could Skyrocket Even Higher By 150,000% While the Real Remi Relief’s $1,700 price projection for XRP is undeniably bold, the analyst goes even further, speculating that the cryptocurrency’s total upside potential in this cycle could soar as high as 80,000% and 150,000%. This surge could catapult XRP’s current price of $2.4 to an astonishing $1,920 and $3,600, respectively.

It offers a staking yield of 11.5%, significantly higher than most layer-2 cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum ( ETH ), TRON ( TRX ), and Solana ( SOL ). In addition to strong fundamentals, the main reason DOT is a good buy is that it has remained in a three-year consolidation between $3.76 and $11.33. This consolidation resembles the pattern Monero ( XMR ) followed over the past two years before its eventual surge . DOT appears to be in the accumulation phase of the Wyckoff Theory, which is typically followed by a markup phase. Markup is characterized by higher demand than supply. DOT has also formed a triple bottom at $3.76, a level it has not dropped below since 2023. Therefore, the most likely outlook is a rebound to at least $11.32, a gain of 132% from the current level. A move above that price would signal further upside, potentially to the 50% retracement level at $30, an increase of 500% from its present value.

2025-05-22T18:27:49.000Z,"US stock markets on the verge of a correction as Bitcoin brushes $112,000","The cracks in the US stock market got wider on Thursday as bond yields surged and Wall Street tried to act like nothing was wrong. Stocks edged up, but the numbers were weak and shaky. The Dow Jones added just 156 points. The S&P 500 crawled up by 0.3%, and the Nasdaq squeezed out a 0.7% gain. That came as the 30-year Treasury yield hit 5.14%, the highest it’s been since October 2023, right after lawmakers pushed through a new bill that traders say could make the deficit spiral out of control. That bill, passed in the House early Thursday along party lines, would cut taxes and increase military spending. It’s now on its way to the Senate. The Congressional Budget Office says the total cost could hit $4 trillion, which would blow a hole in the already massive national debt. At the same time, fears of inflation are rising again, partly because of President Trump’s universal tariffs, which are already weighing on bonds and lifting yields even higher. Traders face rising yields, budget blowouts Longer-term yields are climbing fast. The 10-year Treasury also rose during the session but came down a bit later. Still, yields are moving in the wrong direction for borrowers. These are the same rates that shape mortgages, credit card interest, and all kinds of consumer debt. That’s putting pressure on an economy already hit by Trump’s trade moves. Jed Ellerbroek, who manages portfolios at Argent Capital Management, told CNBC, “Short term, the tax bill is good for the economy. It is going to boost GDP growth in 2026. It reduces taxes for lots of people, it increases spending, especially on defense, and so those things are stimulative to the economy.” But Jed didn’t sound optimistic beyond that. “Longer term, yeah, it blows out the deficit. Yields are going higher, which means prices are going down because Treasuries are becoming incrementally less appealing and trustworthy.” The Treasury auction on Wednesday was already a mess. Demand for 20-year bonds dropped hard, which pushed yields even higher and sent stocks into reverse. That selloff hasn’t disappeared, and investors say it could get worse if the Senate passes the same bill. Chris Senyek, chief strategist at Wolfe Research, said in a note Thursday, “Not shockingly, the long-term US fiscal situations is on an unsustainable path with spending levels YTD surprising to the upside again, with only 2020/2021 trends likely to be worse when the US reaches its September fiscal year-end.” He added, “Our sense is bond vigilantes are likely to start ‘pushing back’ on this unsustainable long-term outlook encapsulated in the tax bill working its way through Congress by sending long-term yields higher.” Chris also pointed out that the US is facing a massive pile of debt that will mature in the next 12 months. Combined with unclear inflation risks and uncertainty about how quickly the Federal Reserve can cut rates, there’s plenty of room for more volatility this year. Bitcoin climbs past $112K while investors ditch bonds While stocks and bonds fumbled, Bitcoin surged again . On Thursday, it jumped above $111,000, climbing as high as $112,009 before holding steady near $111,578 by press time. The increase was about 3% on the day. That pushes the total gain for 2025 to over 18% so far. This rally has been a slow grind—way different from the wild runs of the past. It’s being powered by large players. Big firms are buying. Companies are holding more of it. Bitcoin is being treated more like a safe haven than a gamble. One of the big reasons? Moody’s slapped the US with a fresh debt downgrade, which made a lot of investors run straight to crypto. Bitcoin’s typical link with tech stocks is also starting to fade. It used to move in sync with the Nasdaq, but now it’s heading in its own direction. Some traders say that’s because more people are seeing it as a backup plan for when the dollar becomes unreliable. New numbers show the trend isn’t just talk. Bitcoin ETFs have barely seen any outflows this month, with only two days of outflows in all of May. Data from SoSoValue shows the rest has been non-stop inflows. And it’s not just funds. Public companies are buying bitcoin like crazy. Their holdings are up 31% this year to about $349 billion, making up 15% of all bitcoin in circulation, based on data from Bitcoin Treasuries. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

U.S. stock indices inched up on Thursday, even as rising bond yields and concerns over mounting government debt cast uncertainty over the broader economy. On May 22, the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded at 42,013 points, up 153 points or 0.36 percent. The S&P 500 rose 0.31 percent to 5,863 points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.59 percent, reaching 21,203 points.

You might also like: Dow Jones posts modest gains as U.S. debt downgrade shakes Wall Street The market’s positive move came despite a climb in bond yields, which have failed to attract significant investor demand. Long-term U.S. Treasury yields crossed the 5 percent threshold, with the 30-year bond yielding 5.128 percent. Typically, rising bond yields pull capital away from equities as investors seek stable, fixed returns. However, the attractiveness of Treasuries has declined, largely due to growing concerns over U.S. dollar-denominated debt and the expanding federal deficit. Are bonds, or Bitcoin, a safe haven? Uncertainty around U.S. fiscal policy has intensified after proposed tax cuts by former President Donald Trump were projected to significantly expand the national deficit. Combined with elevated Treasury yields, the cost of servicing government debt is expected to climb, prompting some investors to reconsider the role of bonds as a traditional safe haven.

As of May 22, the average 30-year fixed mortgage reached 6.86 percent, the highest level since February. This rise in borrowing costs could reduce housing affordability and weigh on consumer spending, especially for homeowners with variable-rate loans. Instead, an increasing number of traders are turning to alternative assets like gold and Bitcoin (BTC) . Bitcoin rose 4 percent on May 22, reaching a new all-time high of 111,970 dollars.

2025-05-22T18:21:23.000Z,"'Major Wake-Up Call': How $400M Coinbase Breach Exposes Crypto's Dark Side","Last week's highly organized breach of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN) left behind more questions than answers. While some hailed Coinbase's response as a \""really great example\"" in dealing with a crisis, the breach has now caused a potentially massive privacy issue that mirrors the Ledger data breach in 2021 — which led to a spate of real-world robberies as criminals were able to get a hold of names and addresses of crypto holders. Coinbase has already acknowledged that its customers may have lost close to half a billion U.S. dollars as a result of its breach. Cybercriminals accessed Coinbase user data by bribing and convincing Coinbase support employees to share that data, but this was entirely preventable, according to numerous experts that spoke to CoinDesk. “A failsafe system would make stealing data technically impossible, but Coinbase clearly didn't prioritize these measures, leaving the door wide open,” Andy Zhou, co-founder of blockchain security firm BlockSec told CoinDesk. Allowing these criminals to access personal data, whether through a hack or, in this case, social engineering, is a major blight on an exchange that facilitates billions of dollars worth of volume every day. The breach created a myriad of issues, including user privacy and trust . How could Coinbase, a publicly traded company, allow attackers to steal personal information and money through the front door? And could it have been prevented? Hackett Communications CEO Heather Dale hailed Coinbase’s response as a “masterclass in communication,” but Coinbase’s method of tackling the issues was simple: throw as much money at it as possible. The exchange offered a $20 million bug bounty for anyone who reported information that would lead to an arrest or prosecution. It also committed to voluntarily reimbursing impacted users with between $180 million to $400 million. What happened? Before analyzing the fallout of the breach, it’s important to understand how exactly the breach occurred at a publicly traded company that spends millions of dollars per month on security infrastructure. In February, on-chain sleuth ZachXBT reported a rise in thefts involving Coinbase users. He said that it was “a result of aggressive risk models and Coinbase’s failure to stop its users losing $300 [million] per year to social engineering scams.” The fear of cybercriminals stealing hundreds of millions of dollars became a reality last week when Coinbase published a blog post revealing that account balances, government ID images, phone numbers, addresses and masked bank account details were stolen. Unlike other hacks and breaches, which involve attackers exploiting a faulty back-end, these attackers went in through the front door—communicating directly with Coinbase employees and buying access to the information via rogue insiders. Coinbase claimed that it fired all responsible employees on the spot, although it did not reveal the method it used to find those responsible in the blog post . The issue, however, is not confined to crypto . In 2022, digital bank Revolut confirmed that 50,000 sets of customer data were stolen, while one year later, trading platform Robinhood had up to 5 million email addresses leaked . The latter was fined $45 million by the SEC following the breach after it emerged that a portion of customers had their accounts wiped by attackers . The BBC reported in October that one particular Revolut user lost £165,000 ($220,0000) following a data breach and that the neobank’s fraud detection system prevented £475 million in fraudulent transactions in 2023. Coinbase competitors Binance and Kraken said they managed to fend off similar social engineering attacks in recent weeks. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong also posted a video on X last week, stating that he received a “ransom note” for $20 million in bitcoin in exchange for these attackers not releasing some information they claimed to have obtained on Coinbase customers. ZachXBT added on Thursday that the attackers began obfuscating the stolen funds by swapping BTC for ETH on Thorchain, a venue often used by the infamous North Korean hackers Lazarus Group. 'Major wake-up call' Andy Zhou, co-founder of blockchain security firm BlockSec, told CoinDesk that Coinbase should have conducted “stricter background checks on employees handling sensitive data \"" and set up “alarms for weird activity” like someone suddenly downloading thousands of customer profiles. Zhou added that Coinbase should have implemented several technical solutions. These include strict role-based access, meaning employees only see necessary data, or privacy tools that allow work without exposing raw details (for example, blurring ID photos). Nick Tausek, lead security automation architect at Swimlane, told CoinDesk that the breach should be a “major wake-up call” for robust insider threat detection. “As outsourcing scales and operations stretch across time zones, insider threat detection and access governance cannot be afterthoughts. A single insider with the right access, or in this case, the wrong incentives, can punch a hole in even the most fortified security posture. Because, as this breach shows, it only takes 1% of customers breached to make 100% of the headlines.” However, not everyone is piling onto Coinbase. Michal Pospieszalk, CEO of MatterFi, said that it “isn’t a Coinbase problem, it’s a systemic vulnerability that’s plagued crypto since day one.” He argued that the nature of sending crypto without an intermediary means that all platforms are one misstep away from disaster. Hackers need to engineer a situation that can trick users into sending their funds in an irreversible transaction. In Coinbase's case, attackers gained access to personally identifiable information from a rogue employee. The root issue, according to Pospieszalsk, is the problem of users not knowing whether they are sending funds to the right recipient, adding that crypto runs on a “trust me, bro” model of identity verification and that is not sustainable. What happens next? Coinbase said it would voluntarily reimburse customers who lost funds during the breach and would continue to work with law enforcement to capture those responsible. But for users, it’s a darker road. The exchange said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday that the breach impacted 69,461 customers. The filing also noted that the breach occurred in December 2024 and was not discovered by Coinbase until May 15. These details are out on the internet now, and may even be for sale on the dark web and in shady Telegram groups. After the Ledger breach, customer details were published on Raidforums , a nefarious data-sharing platform, which led to a rise in phishing attempts. Unfortunately, Coinbase can't do anything to prevent the sharing of this leaked information, leaving the affected users to attempt to put in as many safeguards as possible. These include changing wallets, changing deposit addresses on exchanges and even changing home addresses to avoid the risk of real-world robberies. Users whose social security numbers were leaked should also lock their credit to prevent identity theft. It may be cumbersome, but as seen earlier this year during the attempted kidnapping of Ledger co-founder David Balland (and several other individuals over the past few weeks), criminals will not stop until they extract the maximum amount of funds, even if it means inflicting brutal acts of violence. This also raises a potential legal question: If a Coinbase customer were to be robbed or assaulted due to the data breach, would Coinbase be liable? Ledger failed to escape a proposed class action lawsuit earlier this year, with plaintiffs alleging that Ledger violated its privacy policy and should have had measures in place to prevent the breach. Crypto researcher Molly White also pointed out that Coinbase changed its user agreement in April, adding two clauses limiting class action lawsuits and requiring lawsuits to be filed in New York, with changes being applied on May 15, the same day the breach was announced. Coinbase responded to CoinDesk about White’s claims, stating that the exchange had “notified customers well in advance ” of the user agreement change and that it had a class action waiver in place for “years.” Coinbase did not, however, comment on questions related to whether the breach was preventable or how it will safeguard customers who could be at risk of real-world robberies in the future.

2025-05-22T18:19:38.000Z,"Bitcoin Pizza Day — 15th-anniversary","May 22, 2025, marks the 15th anniversary of a now legendary first purchase made with Bitcoin: on that day in 2010, early Bitcoin developer Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 BTC to buy two pizzas. What happened to Hanyecz and Jeremy Sturdivant, who received these bitcoins, and what is the deep meaning behind the first Pizza Day? Table of Contents What is Bitcoin Pizza Day? What do Hanyecz and Sturdivant think of their trade years later? 15 years later, the community is still celebrating on social media What’s the meaning of Bitcoin Pizza Day? What is Bitcoin Pizza Day? Laszlo Hanyecz is an early Bitcoin adopter, developer, and miner from Florida. He is one of the pioneers of GPU mining. On May 18, 2010, he published an unusual post on BitcoinTalk, a Bitcoin forum created by Satoshi Nakamoto. In the post, Hanyecz was urging anyone to send him two large pizzas in exchange for 10,000 bitcoins. He mentioned that he likes onions, peppers, sausage, mushrooms, tomatoes, pepperoni, and regular cheese pizzas. He asked not to make things like “weird fish topping,” etc. “If you are interested please let me know and we can work out a deal,” he concluded. The discussion in the comment section took several days. Some thought Hanyecz offered too low a price, citing that 10,000 BTC could be exchanged for only $41, which was not a good amount for two large pizzas and delivery. Others found it hard to order a pizza from outside the U.S. When someone asked Laszlo if he was hungry, he replied : “I just think it would be interesting if I could say that I paid for a pizza in bitcoins.” Consciously or not, this answer emphasizes the original purpose of Bitcoin as an electronic cash system, as is outlined in the Bitcoin white paper by none other than Satoshi Nakamoto. On May 22, Hanyecz stated that he successfully bought two pizzas for 10,000 BTC and posted a link to a photo of two large pizzas and Laszlo with his kids. He added that he is always happy to receive two large pizzas, so his offer is open as long as he has funds. “I usually have plenty,” he said–in 2010, the block reward was 50 BTC. The person who bought Hanyecz pizzas in return for his bitcoins was identified as Jeromy Sturdivant, a Californian student who was 19 years old at that time. In August, the BTC price spiked, and new comments appeared, mockingly asking Hanyecz if he was still going to pay 10,000 BTC ($600) for two pizzas. He replied that he could not do this anymore and thanked everyone (!) who already bought him pizzas. In November 2010, some asked if it was okay to eat pizza for $26,000. As the Bitcoin price continued to grow, more and more people were flocking to the thread, wondering if Laszlo was regretting eating pizza that cost that much (the prices were getting bigger from message to message). As of May 22, 2025, several hours after the Bitcoin price reached another all-time high, 10,000 BTC equals $1.1 billion. What do Hanyecz and Sturdivant think of their trade years later? Sturdivant, who received 10,000 BTC, gave a number of interviews. He said he realized that he was setting a historical precedent while admitting that if he didn’t do that, someone else would eventually buy pizza for Hanyecz. I feel my part wasn’t critical or irreplaceable, but it was an important step to be taken, and I’m glad to have had the opportunity to take it myself. Beyond that, I’m just as excited to take part in the future and don’t have any intention of pining away for the “glory days.” Some publications claim Sturdivant spent all of his bitcoins to travel with his girlfriend, while in the interview, he mentions he spent bitcoins received from Hanyecz when they cost around $400, ten times bigger than at the time of purchase. As for Hanyecz, he said he didn’t perceive spending 10,000 BTC for pizza as an expensive flex. It was the opposite; it was a rare fortune to get rewarded with free food for his hobby of being a network contributor. Usually, hobbies are money sinks, Hanyecz said. “It wasn’t worth much at the time. I wouldn’t have spent $100 million on pizza, right? But if I hadn’t done that, maybe Bitcoin wouldn’t have become so popular.” In 2018, Hanyecz appeared in Bitcoin history again. He was one of the first testers of Lightning Network and ordered two pizzas via his friend, who agreed to take payment in Lightning Network BTC. The transaction went smoothly, and Hanyecz and his family ate two more pizzas that were bought for Bitcoin. You can read a recollection of this event in Hanyecz’s newsletter .

Educational posts appear here and there. This time, the Bitcoin Pizza Anniversary nicely coincided with another historic achievement–the Bitcoin price exceeded $111,500 for the first time. https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1925542057126338870 Isabella Santos, a founder of BTC Isla and many other Bitcoin-related projects, celebrated the new Bitcoin ATH and Pizza Day by eating a pizza for which she paid in Bitcoin. This is especially remarkable as Santos is busy turning the Mexican island of Isla Mujeres into a Bitcoin hub and has helped over 17 local businesses to start accepting Bitcoin. https://twitter.com/isabellasg3/status/1925238948449640652 Pierre Rochard, Bitcoin Bond company CEO, and an avid Bitcoin advocate, wished a happy Bitcoin Pizza Day while asking why someone needs two pizzas when they can easily be sliced in two instead. Well, probably, that’s because they had no halvings back in 2010. Seeing a lot of pizza influencers promoting pizza today. Here’s the problem with pizza: it’s infinitely divisible. Why buy two pizzas when you can just cut one in half? They never have an honest answer to this simple question. Regardless, happy pizza day! — Pierre Rochard (@BitcoinPierre) May 22, 2025 An X account of Zerohedge media has brought an interesting parallel, pointing out that the current cost of these two Papa John’s pizzas got close to Papa John’s entire market cap. https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/1925518344045703597 If we take a look at the comments to such posts, we will see that the regret narrative (“guy spent millions on pizza, poor he”) that was strong for years has been changed with a legend narrative (“the man is a legend”). People are increasingly supportive of a person who literally made Bitcoin valuable in the real-world economy. They don’t mock him or laugh at him anymore. However, the name of Sturdivant is still less prominent than the name of Hanyecz. What’s the meaning of Bitcoin Pizza Day? In Laszlo’s pizza thread on BitcoinTalk, one of the users wrote in 2016: “Imagine if he wouldn’t of bought that pizza and saved that 10k bitcoins right now. He would have 5 million dollars! That would be awesome.” Another user replied: “Not necessary. The circulation of bitcoin gives its value. If he does not buy the pizza with the bitcoin, the bitcoin is worth nothing.” That is an important point. While Michael Saylor and others may argue that Bitcoin is not fit for being a means of exchange but rather serves as a capital that should not be spent or sold, the initial purpose of Bitcoin was serving as a money network that doesn’t have the flaws of the banking system. Bitcoin is a trustless peer-to-peer payment system, and Hanyecz was the first to try buying something with bitcoins and succeeded, thanks to Sturdivant. Before Bitcoin Pizza Day, Bitcoin was living only within the code lines. On May 22, it was born into a physical world, making its first tiny impact on the real-life economy (electricity bills of miners aside). Hanyecz probably missed some long-term returns, but he hit the gas of the Bitcoin vehicle, making use of it while others were sitting still after switching the ignition. He believed that Bitcoin could actually work as money and set the precedent that, 15 years later, still makes Bitcoin valuable.

We need to ease permitting processes and build data centers,” he said. Answering questions about the stablecoin bill, Sacks said that they received the support of 15 Democratic senators in the Senate vote and that they expect the bill to pass. Stating that this regulation will provide new, cheap and efficient payment infrastructures to the American economy, Sacks said, “Stablecoins will increase the dollar’s dominance in the digital world and create a trillion-dollar demand for treasury bonds.” He argued that stablecoins will be effective immediately once the legal framework is provided. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-22T18:10:45.000Z,"Strategy stock continues to stall despite Bitcoin’s surge to record high","Bitcoin price surged to a record high this week, supported by rising institutional demand and falling supply on exchanges and over-the-counter markets. Bitcoin ( BTC ) was trading at around $111,500 Thursday afternoon, up 4.2% over the past 24 hours. Despite Bitcoin’s strength, the rally is not lifting Strategy stock. MSTR was trading flat for the day at around $403. This performance suggests that the previously strong correlation between Bitcoin and MSTR has broken. There are two main reasons for this divergence. First, Strategy investors are increasingly concerned about ongoing dilution, as the company continues to borrow heavily to finance its Bitcoin purchases. The chart below shows that common shares outstanding have risen from 75.5 million in 2020 to 246 million today. MSTR stock dilution | Source: TradingView This dilution will continue as Strategy revealed that it was selling $2.1 billion in preferred stock sales to fuel Bitcoin purchases. You might also like: Pi Network price could miss out on the crypto bull run as insiders sell In the long term, the company also plans to raise up to 84 billion dollars, equivalent to 76 percent of its current market capitalization. While most of this capital will go toward Bitcoin purchases, some will support broader corporate initiatives. MSTR stock has underperformed Bitcoin as investors question its valuation and mounting losses. The company currently holds 576,230 coins valued at over 64 billion dollars, while its market cap stands at 110 billion dollars. Some analysts believe the valuation gap will eventually narrow, with MSTR’s stock price aligning more closely to the value of its Bitcoin holdings. Meanwhile, Strategy’s soaring losses have added pressure. In its most recent quarterly report, operating expenses jumped to 6 billion dollars, while the net loss widened to 4.1 billion dollars. Revenue fell 3.6 percent year-over-year to 111 million dollars, missing analyst expectations. Investor skepticism has also been fueled by short-sellers. Jim Chanos, a well-known short-seller, revealed a short position in MSTR, alleging that the company is artificially inflating its stock price. Andrew Left of Citron Research issued a similar warning last year, claiming the company operates like a pyramid scheme. MSTR stock price analysis Strategy stock chart | Source: TradingView The daily chart shows that Strategy stock has been trading sideways in recent days, although it remains above the 50-day and 100-day exponential moving averages, which is typically viewed as a bullish signal. The price has formed a bullish pennant pattern, made up of a flagpole and a converging triangle. Before this, it developed a double-bottom formation with support at 237 dollars and a neckline at 343 dollars. Given the improving sentiment in the crypto sector, a breakout to the all-time high of 542 dollars remains a possibility. That move would represent a potential upside of 33 percent from current levels.

2025-05-22T18:02:33.000Z,"Strategy Moves to Raise $2.1B From Shares to Buy More Bitcoin","Strategy, the software intelligence company formerly known as MicroStrategy, is once again doubling down on Bitcoin (BTC). The firm announced earlier today that it plans to sell up to $2.1 billion worth of preferred stock. The money raised will mainly go toward buying more Bitcoin, reinforcing the company’s long-standing bet on the digital asset. Strategy To Sell Preferred Stock With Major Partnerships Strategy announced that it will sell its 10.00% Series A Perpetual Preferred Stock shares under the ticker “STRF” on Nasdaq. The Nasdaq-listed company has made a deal with TD Securities, Barclays Capital, and the Benchmark Company to handle the sales. Depending on market conditions, these firms will act as agents and can sell the shares over time. Notably, no set number of shares must be sold, and the agents are not required to hit any sales target. They will receive a fee of up to 2% of what they sell. The returns from this stock sale will not be kept in escrow, and the company can use the funds as needed. The stock is trading at $100.65 as of May 21. The new shares will carry the same terms as the 8.5 million already in circulation. Strategy New STRF Offering Brings Flexibility Amid Legal Heat The new share offering allows Strategy to sell shares when market conditions are right. This allows the company to raise money without rushing or locking into strict terms. Each share is worth $100 and pays a 10% yearly dividend. However, this 10% dividend is not guaranteed. It depends on whether the company has enough money and whether the board agrees to pay it. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin-focused firm is currently facing serious legal trouble . A group of investors recently filed a class action lawsuit against Strategy. The complaints accused the firm of making false and misleading statements about its profits and the risks associated with its large Bitcoin holdings . Bitcoin at the Center of Strategy’s Future This offering comes as Bitcoin just hit a new all-time high . Earlier today, the asset price briefly touched $111,861 before easing back to around $111,000. For Strategy, this is a strong signal to keep investing in Bitcoin. As of May 21, Strategy owns 576,230 BTC. Starting in August 2020, these were bought at an average price of $69,726 per Bitcoin. At today’s value, those holdings are worth just under $64 billion, nearly 59% more than the company initially paid. Bitcoin now accounts for more than half of Strategy’s total market value, which is $111.4 billion. This latest stock offering will help the company buy more Bitcoin and support its general business needs.

2025-05-22T18:00:23.000Z,"XRP Futures ETF Is Now Live on Nasdaq. Here’s How Investors Can Benefit","In a landmark development for both the digital asset sector and traditional finance, the first-ever XRP Futures Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) has officially gone live on the Nasdaq. According to an announcement from the X-based community Ripplexity, the ETF, launched by Volatility Shares, marks a historic step forward for the mainstream adoption of XRP by providing regulated exposure to its price through futures contracts. This milestone places XRP alongside the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum, both of which have seen their futures-based ETFs open doors for traditional investors to participate in crypto markets without direct custody of the digital asset. For XRP, this debut on one of the world’s leading stock exchanges signals not only increased legitimacy but also a broader opportunity for diversification within institutional and retail investment portfolios. BREAKING: XRP Futures ETF is now LIVE on Nasdaq! Volatility Shares launches the first-ever XRP futures ETF, giving investors regulated exposure to XRP via derivatives. A historic moment for mainstream adoption. #XRP #ETF #Ripple #Nasdaq #XRPL pic.twitter.com/eJfI3WmjqG — Ripplexity (@RippleXity) May 22, 2025 Bridging Traditional Finance and Crypto Futures ETFs have become an essential bridge between legacy financial systems and the evolving digital asset space. By tracking XRP’s futures contracts rather than its spot market price, the newly listed ETF allows investors to gain exposure to XRP without needing to manage private wallets, engage with crypto exchanges, or confront regulatory uncertainty directly. This structure is particularly attractive to risk-conscious institutions and traditional asset managers who must adhere to strict compliance and custody protocols. With the ETF listed on Nasdaq and regulated by U.S. financial authorities, it adds a new layer of credibility and risk mitigation to XRP-based investment products. Moreover, as demand for crypto-linked financial instruments grows, the XRP Futures ETF represents a signal to the broader market that institutional appetite is expanding beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. XRP’s inclusion reflects its growing relevance in global finance, particularly in the cross-border payments sector , where it continues to demonstrate real-world utility. What This Means for XRP’s Market Dynamics The launch of an XRP Futures ETF could serve as a powerful catalyst for increased market liquidity and price discovery. Futures products often bring new volumes and investor behavior into play, which can deepen market participation and enhance overall trading efficiency. Because futures contracts are leveraged instruments, they often draw in more active traders, including hedge funds and algorithmic strategies. This can contribute to tighter spreads, greater volatility, and higher trading volume—key ingredients for a dynamic and responsive market environment. While it’s important to note that futures-based ETFs don’t require the direct purchase of XRP tokens, their existence still influences demand indirectly. As more institutional investors take interest in XRP through regulated channels, the ecosystem surrounding the asset—including spot trading, custody solutions, and liquidity provisioning—will naturally expand. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Boost for XRP’s Broader Adoption Narrative This ETF launch arrives at a time when Ripple, the company closely associated with XRP, is advancing its global ambitions in blockchain-powered finance. From central bank digital currency (CBDC) partnerships to regulatory clarity in major jurisdictions, the XRP ecosystem is steadily aligning with the needs of the modern financial system. By offering exposure to XRP in a traditional investment wrapper, the Volatility Shares ETF can act as an entry point for investors who were previously hesitant due to the complexities of the crypto space. It reduces friction, simplifies access, and opens the door to the trillions of dollars managed in pension funds, ETFs, mutual funds, and other institutional vehicles. This development also reinforces XRP’s role as one of the most actively used and recognized digital assets for real-time payments and settlement. As investor awareness and adoption grow through regulated instruments like ETFs, XRP’s long-term value proposition becomes more visible to a mainstream audience. A Defining Moment for XRP The launch of the XRP Futures ETF on Nasdaq marks a watershed moment in the evolution of crypto-financial products. Volatility Shares’ move to bring XRP into the ETF arena is more than a technical achievement—it’s a statement about the asset’s maturity, resilience, and future potential. With regulatory scrutiny still high across the broader crypto market, a Nasdaq-listed product offering exposure to XRP sends a clear message: the demand for secure, transparent, and regulated access to digital assets is only accelerating. For investors, this presents a timely opportunity to engage with XRP in a framework that meets the standards of traditional finance while offering exposure to the innovation of the blockchain era. As Ripplexity aptly noted, this is a historic moment—not just for XRP, but for the broader convergence of crypto and conventional finance.

2025-05-22T17:50:39.000Z,"This Viral Asset Management Platform is Offering Better Staking Rewards Than Cardano","The Cardano price has been recovering with increasing momentum over the past few weeks due to the renewed bullish sentiment in the broader market. Meanwhile, Unilabs (UNIL), an emerging AI project, outshone ADA’s demand and went viral after revealing up to 122% APYs on staking, surpassing Cardano’s usual up to 7% APY by a significant margin. The AI-powered asset management platform has raised over $30 million in assets under management, highlighting its growing user base. The Unilabs presale has sold over 163 million worth of tokens within two weeks of public launch, setting new standards for ICOs. Experts suggest Unilabs’ staking utility and diverse practical use cases put it in a better position than the Cardano price in the upcoming utility-driven bull leg. Let’s understand how the rising UNIL token can surpass ADA’s growth by the end of the year. Cardano Price Prediction: Is ADA Entering A Bearish Phase? The Cardano price swiftly bounced from the $0.5 support level as the crypto market bulls finally woke up last month after a long silence in the first quarter of 2025. With the introduction of fresh capital, ADA established an upward trend and gained nearly 50% within one and a half months. Last week, the Cardano price lost upward momentum, due to which it reversed from the $0.84 resistance. After a 3.8% intraday surge, it currently trades at $0.756. ADA has been consolidating at the $0.72 support level for the previous few days, where bullish pressure has kept it from falling. Image source: CoinMarketCap If demand declines and bears take control, the Cardano price may slip below the immediate $0.72 support and drop out of the short-term ascending channel. However, if the broader market continues to recover, it can help ADA resume the rally and reach the longer-term resistance at $1.15. Unilabs (UNIL): Earn Passive Income With AI-Backed Portfolios While the Cardano price struggles to maintain bullish momentum, Unilabs is rising steadily, breaking key milestones in its live presale. The UNIL presale has surpassed the $750,000 mark in the first ten days, highlighting the tremendous demand for the undervalued token. With its advanced AI-backed asset management platform, Unilabs is at the forefront of DeFi’s next era. It allows users to invest in growing projects without actively monitoring the market. The platform offers four fund baskets: BTC, AI, RWA, and Mining, which are entirely managed by Unilabs’ AI. The AI scans early-stage opportunities as they arrive in the market and continuously rebalances the $30 million locked capital in these baskets to generate the sector’s highest returns. Users who invest in these funds receive periodic dividends directly in their linked wallets. UNIL Staking Rewards Apart from the consistent fund profits, users can also earn impressive staking rewards by locking in their UNIL tokens. Staking helps keep the ecosystem running by maintaining proper liquidity. Unilabs provides up to 122% APY on staking and offers occasional bonus rewards using a share of the platform’s revenue. UNIL is currently priced at the low price of $0.0051 in stage two of the presale. The token’s value has surged 27.5% over the past week, as the stage one price was $0.004. New investors can make similar gains when UNIL reaches a valuation of $0.0062 in the third stage. Conclusion As the Cardano price action becomes uncertain, ADA investors are moving towards rising projects such as Unilabs, which can offer better growth in the 2025 bull market. The UNIL presale offers an excellent option for investors who are looking for stable and predictable returns in the next stage of the new bull cycle.

Ives simply referred to them as a “new design movement” that would be similar to Apple’s family of hardware and software integrations. OpenAI has raised billions of dollars from investors, who view the company as a stalwart in the AI industry following the overwhelming success of its ChatGPT large language model (LLM). As of May, ChatGPT had nearly 800 million weekly active users, according to industry data. These usage trends were behind OpenAI’s massive $157 billion valuation as of October 2024 — a figure that nearly doubled to $300 billion by March 2025.ChatGPT usage trends.

With Bitcoin (BTC) hitting an all-time high, market speculators are banking on eventual capital rotation, which could pump major altcoins like SOL toward new highs.Solana shows promising signs on the daily chart, forming a textbook bull flag pattern after a strong uptrend. While SOL prices currently trade under $180, a breakout above this level could propel SOL toward its first target at $200, with further upside potential to $220 if momentum sustains.Solana 1-day chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe trend remains bullish, supported by the relative strength index (RSI) at 64.30, indicating healthy momentum without overbought conditions. However, SOL needs a clear market structure break (MSB) or a decisive bullish breakout above $180 to trigger the next leg of the rally. Declining volumes during the consolidation phase suggest caution, as a lack of buying pressure could stall the breakout. If SOL fails to breach $180, the immediate key area of interest is between $140-150, and the bull flag pattern would be invalidated.

2025-05-22T15:00:00.000Z,"Semiconductor exemptions don’t matter when it comes to tariffs","Opinion by: Ahmad Shadid of O.xyzSemiconductors scored a rare exemption from US President Donald Trump’s aggressive reciprocal tariffs, but the relief is symbolic at best. Most semiconductors enter the US embedded in servers, GPUs, laptops, and smartphones. The finished goods remain heavily tariffed, some with duties reaching up to 49%. The exemption looks good politically but delivers little practical benefit. Nvidia’s DGX systems, crucial for training advanced AI models, do not fall under the exempted HTS codes. Nvidia could pay effective tariffs nearing 40% on these vital components. Such costs threaten to stall critical AI infrastructure projects across the country. Semiconductor tariffs may compromise the goal of the CHIPS Act. The act promised tens of billions of dollars in subsidies to support domestic chip manufacturing. Yet advanced lithography machines — key equipment from countries like the Netherlands and Japan — face 20%–24% tariffs. Ironically, tariffs designed to boost American production increase the cost of essential manufacturing equipment.The effect of new tariffs is already slowing progress in critical supply chains — just as generative AI and large language models are gaining momentum across sectors like finance and defense. Any delays or cost increases now could blunt America’s technological advantage.Indirect costs undermine exemptions for AIModern semiconductor supply chains are global and highly integrated. An exemption on raw silicon means nothing when servers, GPUs and other finished products face steep tariffs. Tariffs indirectly inflate costs, eliminating any competitive advantage from domestic manufacturing.Indirect tariff costs hit high-end systems disproportionately hard. The effect ripples through AI model training, data center expansions and major infrastructure projects, significantly slowing the industry’s momentum.Tariff impasse halts investmentSo far, it’s clear that the US president’s tariff plan didn’t follow any conventional economic trends or calculated strategy. The uncertain tariff situation stalls investment decisions across the technology sector. Companies need predictable costs to justify large capital expenditures. Ongoing tariff volatility prevents them from committing resources to new data centers and manufacturing lines.This mirrors the supply chain chaos of 2020. At that time, uncertainty caused massive order cancellations and slowed industry recovery for years. If tariff ambiguity continues, we could see similar waves of cancellations in 2025. This would further compound existing inventory and revenue issues in the semiconductor sector.Domestic production is not optimalThe border argument for these tariffs is that they’re meant to boost domestic production. They do little, however, to encourage genuine domestic semiconductor production. Despite subsidies under the CHIPS Act, most US semiconductor companies still rely on international foundries for manufacturing. Instead, they face increased equipment and operational costs.Recent: How trade wars impact stocks and cryptoThe idea that tariffs promote domestic production ignores the reality of global semiconductor manufacturing. Costs rise across the board, putting American companies at a disadvantage rather than offering protection.AI projects face heightened riskThe blockchain and crypto sectors, particularly AI-driven projects, also feel the pinch. Projects depend heavily on GPUs and high-performance servers for mining, validating transactions and running decentralized AI computations. Increased hardware costs directly affect profitability and growth, potentially stalling innovation in blockchain applications. AI developments have just started to pick up the pace in the blockchain and Web3 space. The industry saw increased interest from investors and VCs just a year ago. So, they are still on tighter budgets. Elevated costs can, however, lead to stagnation. We might see innovators and developers exiting the market. The ripple effect extends beyond the general technology sector and could threaten future digital economies. Moreover, these cost pressures disproportionately affect startups and smaller tech firms. Industry giants can absorb additional expenses, but innovative, smaller players face existential threats. This dynamic risks stifling innovation at the grassroots level, harming the entire tech ecosystem.What to expect Semiconductors have momentarily escaped direct tariffs, but the exemption provides little benefit. Tariffs continue to hit finished products, driving up indirect costs across the industry. Instead of boosting domestic manufacturing, these tariffs create economic paralysis, stall critical infrastructure projects, and threaten America’s lead in AI innovation. Policymakers must acknowledge these realities and adjust their approach before irreversible damage is done to the nation’s technological future.Opinion by: Ahmad Shadid of O.xyz.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-22T13:30:00.000Z,"How staking incentivizes trust without burning energy","What if a financial system could run itself not by burning electricity, but by rewarding good behavior? That’s the promise of staking, a mechanism that powers many modern blockchains by turning users into network operators. In this week’s episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Gareth Jenkinson and Nathan Jeffay sit down with StarkWare’s Noam Nisan to unpack how this trustless engine works, why it matters and what’s really at stake.Understanding stakingJeffay began by highlighting how staking is part of the backbone that keeps the blockchain running, and runs itself, with volunteers.“By doing this, they’re saying, OK, we’re taking this task of running the blockchain seriously. Here's some of our money. We're putting it down. We're showing that we're serious about doing this.”To help unpack this topic further and examine the deeper mechanics behind staking, the hosts are joined by Noam Nisan, principal researcher at StarkWare and a widely respected computer scientist who has held roles at Google and Princeton.Related: How to handle crypto trading gains and losses on your balance sheet“So we have this general system with operators... Why would they want to do that? The system, the protocol, incentivizes them to actually run the system,” Nisan explained. “Basically, it can give them tokens for operating the system.”Staking offers what Nisan describes as two distinct types of security: computer science-based guarantees and economic disincentives for bad actors. “If a majority or supermajority, maybe two-thirds of the parties of the token of the staked amount are behaving properly... we can prove that the system acts correctly,” he said. “But you also have what I would call an economic guarantee... if they destroy the system, very likely the value of the token... will go down. So they are the one losing.”PoW vs PoSJenkinson, a vocal Bitcoin (BTC) supporter, posed the classic comparison: proof-of-work vs proof-of-stake. “Do you have any strong feelings about one or the other?” he asked.“The truth is that it’s not clear.. it's really a social question, I think.”Nisan noted that both mechanisms involve trade-offs around cost, control, and decentralization. The episode also explores the role of staking in tokenomics and system design. Nisan unpacks how fee mechanics and inflation controls, such as Ethereum’s minting curve, help keep the ecosystem in balance.To hear the full conversation on The Clear Crypto Podcast,  listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

2025-05-22T12:38:44.000Z,"UK court partially dismisses Bitcoin SV investor’s lawsuit against Binance","The United Kingdom’s Court of Appeal has partially dismissed a lawsuit brought by Bitcoin SV investors against major crypto exchanges, including Binance, for allegedly conspiring to delist the token in 2019.In a judgment handed down on May 21, the court ruled that investors who held BSV through the delisting period (classified as “sub-class B”) were not entitled to billions in speculative damages based on BSV’s hypothetical growth.These investors had claimed over 8.9 billion British pounds ($11.9 billion) in damages, asserting that Binance’s delisting deprived holders of the chance to profit from BSV’s potential rise to a “top-tier cryptocurrency” like Bitcoin (BTC) or Bitcoin Cash (BCH).The court rejected this “foregone growth effect” theory, stating, “BSV was obviously not a unique cryptocurrency without reasonably similar substitutes,” pointing to the representative’s own use of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash as comparators.Sub-class B’s central claim was that delisting led to a missed opportunity to benefit from price appreciation.

2025-05-22T10:21:18.000Z,"Can ChatGPT-powered AI agents really trade crypto for you?","Key takeawaysChatGPT-powered AI agents automate trading tasks using natural language prompts and API integrations, improving speed and consistency.Successes occur when ChatGPT is used as a support tool, not a fully autonomous trading system.Failures happen when traders over-rely on ChatGPT without real-time data, proper risk management or manual oversight.Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance.What if a crypto trader didn’t need to constantly check charts, worry about emotions, or stay up all night watching for sudden price swings? What if those tasks could be handled by an intelligent agent that understands instructions in plain English — and reacts within milliseconds? That’s where ChatGPT-powered AI agents come in.These tools combine natural language processing with real-time trading logic to automate decision-making in one of the world’s most volatile markets. From rebalancing portfolios to reacting to market sentiment, ChatGPT is being adapted to act as a trading assistant, risk manager and market analyst — all rolled into one. But can it truly match or even outperform human intuition? This article explores how far these agents have come, where they shine and where they still fall short.How ChatGPT-powered AI agents operate in cryptocurrency marketsChatGPT-powered AI agents are changing how people interact with crypto markets. These tools combine ChatGPT’s language abilities with external trading tools and APIs to help users monitor prices, understand trends and even place trades automatically. Instead of just reacting to charts or numbers, ChatGPT can understand plain language commands like “Buy Ethereum if the price drops below $2,000” or “Sell Bitcoin if RSI goes above 70.”These AI trading assistants can work with major platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, OKX and other centralized or decentralized exchanges and can also tap into decentralized finance (DeFi) tools and smart contracts. With the right setup, ChatGPT can help automate trading strategies based on both technical data and market news.Success stories vs. failures in ChatGPT-powered crypto tradingSome traders have used ChatGPT to assist in automating parts of their crypto trading processes, particularly for strategy generation and sentiment analysis. For example, a user shared on Reddit that they used a ChatGPT-based AI agent for technical analysis on Ether (ETH), feeding it four-hour and daily chart screenshots. By interpreting market sentiment, support and resistance zones, and other indicators, they managed to make $6,500 in profits.Similarly, in the broader crypto sector, ChatGPT has been applied to support project development activities such as drafting white papers and marketing content. A notable example is the launch of the “TURBO” memecoin, which reportedly reached a market capitalization of over $50 million in 2024. In this case, ChatGPT was used to streamline documentation and communication rather than manage trading activity, illustrating its usefulness as a support tool in crypto-related initiatives.However, limitations are evident when ChatGPT is applied beyond its core design. While ChatGPT could suggest a trading portfolio and explain its reasoning clearly, it lacks access to real-time market data and couldn’t respond to sudden volatility. In one instance, ChatGPT was allocated $100 across multiple tokens but failed to actively manage the portfolio as prices fluctuated. This resulted in missed opportunities and underperformance compared to dynamic algorithmic strategies.Individual experiences reinforce these observations. A Redditor exposed a scam where a YouTuber promoted a “ChatGPT trading bot” tutorial that led users to deploy malicious smart contracts. The contracts, generated using ChatGPT and passed off as safe, were designed to drain user wallets once funded. Victims collectively lost $17,240 in ETH, highlighting the danger of blindly trusting AI-generated code without proper auditing.Even when asked, “If I use ChatGPT to build an AI agent for crypto trading, can I become a millionaire?” ChatGPT responded with a realistic outlook — acknowledging that while it’s possible, success depends on having a profitable strategy, disciplined risk management, and the ability to scale effectively.Here is ChatGPT’s response:These cases suggest that while ChatGPT can support certain elements of the trading process, it should not be treated as a standalone solution for autonomous crypto trading.AI in crypto trading: Key benefits and limitationsAI tools like ChatGPT are increasingly being integrated into crypto trading workflows to improve speed, accuracy and efficiency. While they offer important advantages, they also carry specific limitations that traders must actively manage. Below are the main benefits and challenges:Key benefits of using AI for crypto tradingAI bots can execute trades in milliseconds, crucial for capturing opportunities in fast-moving crypto markets.Bots follow pre-programmed rules precisely, eliminating emotional biases that often affect human traders.Crypto markets are always open, and AI bots can monitor and act around the clock without interruption.A single bot can manage multiple trading pairs, exchanges and strategies simultaneously.ChatGPT can understand specific prompts like “Rebalance every Monday” or “Set stop-loss at 5%,” allowing flexible automation.Limitations of ChatGPT in cryptocurrency tradingChatGPT does not access live market data unless specifically integrated with external APIs (e.g., TradingView, CoinMarketCap or exchange websockets).Instructions must be clear and unambiguous; ChatGPT may misinterpret vague or complex commands.Improperly secured API keys or lack of two-factor authentication (2FA) can expose trading accounts to unauthorized access.ChatGPT’s cloud-based infrastructure can introduce latency, which could impact performance during highly volatile periods.ChatGPT does not monitor regional compliance rules; users must manually enforce trading limits based on local regulations.Ethical and regulatory implications of AI in crypto tradingAs AI becomes more integrated into trading systems, it raises significant ethical and regulatory concerns that stakeholders across the financial sector are beginning to address.Accountability: If an AI agent executes a harmful or unlawful trade, questions arise around legal responsibility. It remains unclear in many jurisdictions whether liability falls primarily on the developer, the trader using the AI system or the platform facilitating the transactions.Market manipulation risks: Autonomous AI bots could unintentionally engage in activities such as spoofing (placing and canceling fake orders to mislead the market) or wash trading (creating artificial volume), especially if not properly programmed with compliance safeguards.Regulatory oversight: Financial authorities, including the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the European Securities and Markets Authority, are actively studying the implications of AI and algorithmic trading. These agencies have recognized that traditional trading regulations may not fully account for autonomous decision-making by AI systems.Policy developments: In January 2024, the European Commission released updates to its Digital Finance Strategy, which included references to AI-based financial services. While not yet finalized, these draft regulations under the broader Digital Finance Package signal a move toward stricter compliance expectations for firms deploying AI in financial markets.Meanwhile, ethical crypto platforms are beginning to voluntarily disclose the use of trading bots in their systems. In parallel, open-source communities are advocating for clearer audit trails, improved model transparency and the establishment of ethical guidelines for AI applications in finance to ensure accountability and fairness.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-22T08:37:57.000Z,"Dubai regulator clarifies real-world asset tokenization rules: Lawyer","Newly updated guidelines from Dubai’s crypto regulator include provisions on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and clarify rules for issuers. On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) released its updated Rulebook for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) operating in the region. The regulator gave market participants until June 19 to comply with the new rules. The regulator previously told Cointelegraph that it had enhanced supervisory mechanisms and brought consistency across activity-based rules. One of the more prominent changes includes regulatory clarity on RWA tokens. Irina Heaver, partner at the United Arab Emirates-based law firm NeosLegal, told Cointelegraph that the updated rules clarify RWA issuance and distribution. “Issuing real-world asset tokens and listing them on secondary markets is no longer theoretical,” Heaver told Cointelegraph. “It’s now a regulatory reality in Dubai and the broader UAE.”A “viable” path to realize RWA hypeHeaver compared RWAs to security token offerings (STOs), an earlier attempt from the crypto space to tokenize securities like stocks, bonds and real estate investment trusts. However, the UAE crypto lawyer said that STOs “died a peaceful death in 2018 to 2019.” The lawyer told Cointelegraph STOs did not work out because of the lack of regulatory clarity, viable secondary market trading venues, institutional investor appetite and liquidity. Still, the situation is different for RWAs. Heaver told Cointelegraph that RWAs are the next foundational layer for institutional adoption of blockchain and virtual assets. Heaver said that VARA’s new rules already cover them as Asset-Referenced Virtual Assets (ARVA) tokens. She said: “VARA’s newly updated Virtual Asset Issuance Rulebook (May 2025) addresses these failures head-on. Regulated exchanges and broker-dealers in Dubai are now authorized to distribute and list ARVA tokens.”The lawyer said this solves an issue in jurisdictions like Switzerland, where token issuance is possible, but listing and secondary trading remain unregulated. Related: Dubai gov’t agencies to link real estate registry with property tokenizationLawyer shares requirements for RWA issuersHeaver said ARVA tokens are defined under Dubai law as representing direct or indirect ownership of real-world assets, granting entitlement to receive or share income and purporting to maintain a stable value by reference to real-world assets or income. ARVA tokens are also backed or collateralised by such real-world assets or constitute a derivative, wrapped, duplicated, or fractionalised version of another ARVA. The lawyer said issuers must meet specific requirements, including a Category 1 Virtual Asset Issuance license, a comprehensive white paper and a risk disclosure statement. In addition, issuers must have a paid-up capital of 1.5 million UAE dirhams (about $408,000) or 2% of reserve assets held. The issuers are also subjected to monthly independent audit obligations and must adhere to ongoing supervisory oversight. “VARA is providing regulatory clarity, and it’s giving the industry a viable, enforceable path to turn the hype of RWA tokenization into reality,” Heaver told Cointelegraph. “This matters because it marks a shift, from theory to execution, from fiction to framework.”Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/dubai-vara-guidelines-rwa-tokenization-clarity?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-22T08:25:00.000Z,"5 red flags you’re being shilled: Don’t buy the hype","What is shilling in crypto?              At its core, shilling is the act of artificially promoting a cryptocurrency or token, often with exaggerated claims, to increase its price or popularity. But what’s the goal? Hype it up, get others to buy in, and then cash out, leaving latecomers holding the bag.Shilling can come from anyone: influencers, anonymous accounts or even high-profile figures with political or financial clout. The common thread is manipulation: It’s not about educating you or building real value but pumping hype for personal gain.Unfortunately, the line between enthusiastic promotion and outright deception can be thin, and many fall victim without realizing it. That’s why it’s critical to learn how to spot the signs early.                  5 red flags you’re being shilled              Beware of crypto red flags like overhyped promises, anonymous teams, influencer shills, missing products and FOMO tactics — if it smells like a scam, it probably is.1. Overhyped promises You’ve probably seen posts that scream:“100x potential!”“Guaranteed returns!”“This is your ticket to financial freedom!”These are classic shill tactics. Real, credible projects don’t promise life-changing profits. Why? Because there are no guarantees in crypto or in any investment.When a project leads with grandiose financial claims rather than actual product value or utility, it’s likely a ploy to stir FOMO and attract unsuspecting investors. The truth is, if something sounds too good to be true, it almost always is.Remember: The bigger the promise, the bigger the red flag.2. Anonymous or suspicious teams In crypto, anonymity isn’t always bad, but when you’re trusting people with your money, transparency matters.It’s a major red flag when a project has:No identifiable team membersFake names or aliasesStock photos on its websiteNo LinkedIn or professional history.The simple rule is “No face, no funds.”Scammers often hide behind anonymity because they know they’ll eventually vanish and there’ll be no one to hold accountable. Even worse, some use fabricated credentials or hire actors to pose as team members.Before investing, check whether the founders or developers have any verifiable history. Do they have prior experience in blockchain or startups? Have they launched anything successful before?3. Influencer spam and paid promotions One day, no one’s talking about a particular coin — the next, your feed is flooded with influencers hyping it up. Sound familiar?This sudden burst of attention is often coordinated with a paid promotion campaign disguised as “genuine enthusiasm.”Many influencers fail to disclose sponsorships, even though it’s required by law in many countries. The US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have cracked down on this in recent years.Take, for example:Kim Kardashian, who was fined $1.26 million in 2022 for promoting EthereumMax without proper disclosure.Floyd Mayweather Jr., who was sued for endorsing the same project at a paid event.BitBoy (Ben Armstrong), who faced legal action in multiple lawsuits for promoting scam tokens to his audience.If you notice multiple influencers promoting the same project in a short time, especially without using labels like #ad or #sponsored, it’s a strong indicator of a shill campaign.Don’t mistake volume for value. Hype doesn’t equal legitimacy.4. No real product or roadmapIf you visit the project’s website, it looks sleek, maybe even impressive. But where’s the product? Where’s the code?Shilled tokens often rely on flashy marketing but have no working application, no GitHub code and no actual use case. Everything is either “coming soon” or buried behind vague promises.Ask yourself:Can I use the platform or app today?Is there a white paper that makes sense?Do they have public repositories or open development?If all you’re seeing is a landing page and a vague roadmap that’s been “coming soon” for months, that’s a major red flag.5. Pressure tactics and FOMO Time pressure is a psychological weapon, and shillers know how to use it.Watch out for lines such as:“Presale ends in 2 hours!”“Only 1,000 spots left!”“If you don’t buy now, you’ll miss out forever!”These tactics prey on your fear of missing out (FOMO) and push you into making impulsive decisions without research.But crypto isn’t a sprint; it’s a long-term game. Anyone trying to rush you into buying likely has something to hide. Solid investments don’t need fake urgency.Take a breath, step back, and ask yourself: Am I buying because I believe in this project or because I’m being manipulated?Did you know? The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) secured a $128-million judgment against Ryan Mitchell Pope, Daniel Samuel Bishop and their company EmpiresX for operating a fraudulent forex and cryptocurrency investment scheme that defrauded over 12,500 victims.                  Is shilling illegal in crypto? Can influencers be sued?              Shilling isn’t just unethical in many cases — it’s also illegal.In the world of crypto, undisclosed promotions are a major legal risk. If someone is paid to promote a token or project but fails to reveal that financial connection, they could face fines, lawsuits or even criminal charges. This is especially true if the promoted token is later classified as a security under US law.Regulators like the SEC, FTC and CFTC have all cracked down on this behavior. Their targets have included:Influencers who failed to disclose paid promotionsPromoters who misled investors with false claimsIndividuals who ran pump-and-dump schemes using social media.Francier Obando Pinillo, a pastor from Miami, was indicted on 26 fraud counts for running a crypto scam through “Solano Fi,” defrauding investors of millions from 2021 to 2023. He allegedly used his church, social media and false promises of 34.9% monthly returns to lure victims. The platform showed fake gains but blocked withdrawals, while funds were diverted for personal use. Pinillo was arraigned in Richland, Washington and faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.As crypto becomes more mainstream, expect stricter regulations and more consequences for shillers.Did you know? Argentine President Javier Milei has dissolved the special task force investigating the LIBRA cryptocurrency scandal, a project he promoted in February 2025 that surged to a $4.5-billion valuation before crashing by over 97%. The task force, created by Milei himself, was disbanded via Decree 332/2025, citing that it had fulfilled its purpose. However, critics argue that no official findings were released, and judicial investigations into Milei and his associates continue.                  How to protect yourself from shilling scams              Do your own research, verify the team and utility, ignore hype and influencers, and stay alert to pump-and-dump schemes to avoid crypto shilling traps.Let’s understand how you can protect yourself from shilling scams in crypto:Do your own research (DYOR): Always research the project, the team behind it and the data supporting the claims. Don’t rely solely on hype or influencer recommendations. Look into onchain data, GitHub activity and the project’s utility to make informed decisions.Verify the team: A legitimate crypto project should have a transparent and credible team. If the developers are anonymous or have no professional profiles (like LinkedIn), that’s a red flag. Always check the team’s past projects and credibility before investing.Look for real utility: Does this project actually solve a problem? A genuine project should have a working product or solution, not just promises. Avoid projects that lack real-world utility or are still in “coming soon” stages for extended periods.Ignore the hype: If a token is suddenly trending on social media or being aggressively promoted, don’t let FOMO influence your judgment. Shillers often rely on emotions to push their agenda, so it’s essential to evaluate projects based on their merits, not just popularity.Stay skeptical of influencers: Influencers with large followings may be paid to promote certain tokens. Before taking their advice, ask yourself, What’s their incentive? Verify the promotion is legitimate and disclosed as paid or sponsored. Always cross-check the information with independent sources.Watch for pump-and-dump schemes: Be cautious of sudden price spikes followed by rapid drops. These are often signs of pump-and-dump schemes where the token’s value is artificially inflated by coordinated buying and then quickly sold off, leaving investors with losses. Always monitor price trends and be wary of sudden, unexplained increases in value.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/5-red-flags-youre-being-shilled-dont-buy-the-hype?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Seeker is the company’s second-generation device, after the Saga Web3 phone that launched in April 2023. The company unveiled the Seeker phone in September 2024, saying it wouldn’t just be a “memecoin phone.” So far, it has pre-sold 150,000 units.The Solana Seeker has gone through two sale phases: The Founder window, where the price for each device was $450, and the Early Adopter window, where the price per device was $500. Assuming the lower price window, Solana Mobile could generate at least $67.5 million in gross revenue from device sales. For comparison, the iPhone generated $199.3 billion in revenue for Apple in 2024.The new architecture that will govern future Solana Mobile devices is called TEEPIN, which stands for “Trusted Execution Environment Platform Infrastructure Network.” It is a three-layer architecture — hardware, platform, and network layers — that will allow users, developers, and device makers to participate in a trustless environment.Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder and CEO of Solana Labs, called TEEPIN “the next evolution in mobile” and a framework where trust is “verified by cryptography.”In addition, Solana Mobile is planning to launch “SKR,” the native asset of the Solana Mobile ecosystem. \""It transforms the traditional mobile business model by giving stakeholders actual ownership in the platform,” said Emmett Hollyer, general manager at Solana Mobile.

This data supports the idea that derivatives markets were not the main driver of the recent price increases. Moreover, the $1.37 billion in net inflows to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States between May 15 and May 20 further suggests that spot buyers, rather than derivatives traders, were the primary force behind the rally.Despite the lack of conviction in Bitcoin futures, several indicators point to further upside. Forced liquidations of bearish BTC futures positions were relatively low at $170 million between May 18 and May 21, cementing the idea of a spot-driven rally. In comparison, the rally to $104,000 on May 9 triggered $538 million in liquidations over three days.Related: Is Bitcoin price close to a cycle top? — 5 indicators that help traders decideBitcoin options put-to-call ratio at Deribit.

For comparison, the put-to-call ratio at Deribit dropped to 0.4x during the previous bull run on Jan. 20, reflecting lower confidence due to reduced volumes in call (buy) options.Bitcoin’s upward movement may have been limited by macroeconomic factors, especially as the tariff war continues. Still, the potential for the price to reach $110,000 and higher is partly based on the weak position of the US Federal Reserve. Injecting liquidity could ease recession concerns, but it also reduces the appeal of government bonds, which favors risk-on assets like Bitcoin.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Could altcoins break above their respective overhead resistance levels? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin price predictionBitcoin rose above the $109,588 overhead resistance, but the bulls are struggling to sustain the higher levels, as seen from the long wick on the candlestick.BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) in the overbought zone indicate that the bulls are in control. If the price closes above $109,588, the BTC/USDT pair could pick up momentum and skyrocket toward $130,000.The 20-day exponential moving average ($101,958) is the critical support to watch out for on the downside. A break below the 20-day EMA will be the first sign that the bulls are booking profits in a hurry. That increases the risk of a break below the psychological support of $100,000. Ether price predictionBuyers are trying to sustain Ether (ETH) above the $2,550 level but are facing significant resistance from the bears.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping 20-day EMA ($2,334) and the RSI near the overbought zone indicate that buyers are in control. The ETH/USDT pair is likely to pick up momentum on a break above $2,739. That clears the path for a rally to $3,000.Contrary to this assumption, a break and close below the 20-day EMA signals that the bears are back in the game. The pair could tumble to $2,111, which is likely to attract solid buying by the bulls.XRP price predictionXRP (XRP) has been witnessing a tough battle between the buyers and sellers at the 20-day EMA ($2.35).XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. If the price skids below the 20-day EMA, the XRP/USDT pair may stay inside the $2 to $2.65 range for a while. Instead, if the price turns up sharply from the 20-day EMA and breaks above $2.65, the advantage will tilt in favor of the bulls. The pair could rally to $3 and, after that, to $3.40, where the sellers are expected to mount a strong defense.BNB price predictionBNB (BNB) bulls have held the 20-day EMA ($639) support during the pullback, indicating buying on dips. BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bulls will try to push the price above $693 but are expected to face solid selling by the bears. However, if buyers bulldoze their way through, the BNB/USDT pair could skyrocket to the overhead resistance at $745.This optimistic view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and breaks below the 20-day EMA. That could sink the pair to the 50-day SMA ($609). Solana price predictionSellers failed to pull Solana (SOL) below the 20-day EMA ($164), indicating demand at lower levels.SOL/USDT daily chart.

If they can pull it off, the SOL/USDT pair could accelerate toward the target objective of $210 and then $220.If sellers want to prevent the upside, they will have to quickly tug the price below the 20-day EMA. The pair could slide to $153 and later to the 50-day SMA ($145). That suggests a possible range-bound action between $120 and $180.Dogecoin price predictionDogecoin (DOGE) has bounced off the breakout level of $0.21, indicating that buyers are active at lower levels.DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe 20-day EMA ($0.21) is trending up, and the RSI is in the positive zone, signaling that buyers are in command.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewBuyers will have to drive and maintain the price above the $23.50 resistance to gain the upper hand.

2025-05-21T17:55:00.000Z,"Interest groups, lawmakers to protest Trump&#039;s memecoin dinner","Democratic leaning organizations and members of Congress have announced plans to protest what they describe as the sale of access to the office of the US president, in reference to Donald Trump’s memecoin dinner on May 22. The event’s attendees are said to have collectively spent over $100 million for the chance to meet with the US president.Since Trump’s memecoin project, Official Trump (TRUMP), announced that its top 220 tokenholders would have an opportunity to apply for an exclusive dinner with the president, many leaders in the crypto industry and US lawmakers have criticized the event, saying Trump was opening his office to potential bribery and corruption. The memecoin dinner prompted some Democratic lawmakers to withdraw support for crypto-related legislation in Congress, including the market structure and stablecoin bills.“Trump collecting gifts from foreign governments is unconstitutional,” a spokesperson for the consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen, which is planning to protest near the memecoin dinner on May 22, told Cointelegraph. “Collecting foreign government investments through his memecoin is not much better. American foreign policy should not be for sale.”Source: Public CitizenCrypto industry figures such as Tron founder Justin Sun, Kronos Research chief investment officer Vincent Liu, Hyperithm co-CEO Oh Sangrok, and Synthetix founder Kain Warwick are among the tokenholders expected to attend the dinner at the Trump National Golf Club outside Washington, DC. The memecoin project said all applicants had to pass a background check and could not be from a “[Know Your Customer] watchlist country.”Related: Democrats seek suspicious activity reports linked to Trump crypto venturesPublic Citizen, in partnership with progressive political organization Our Revolution, will hold a rally near the golf club, which Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley is expected to attend. In addition, the Arlington and Loudoun Democrats will be hosting a separate event to urge US officials to “hold [Trump] accountable,” and Democratic leadership in Congress has scheduled two press events on May 22 ahead of the dinner.“Americans cannot and will not accept President Trump’s view that positions of power exist only to benefit the holder of that power,” Ryan Ruzic, chair of the Loudoun County Democratic Committee, told Cointelegraph. “We have a moral responsibility to speak out against corruption, whatever the result may be.”Pushback on TRUMP memecoin affected crypto legislationSome lawmakers initially cited the memecoin dinner and the Trump family’s involvement with the crypto platform World Liberty Financial in opposing passage of the GENIUS Act, a bill to regulate payment stablecoins. World Liberty Financial began issuing its own USD1 stablecoin in March, prompting concerns about Trump’s conflicts of interest. However, the legislation passed a key procedural vote in the Senate on May 19 with support from Democrats, setting the bill up for debate in the chamber.“Many senators, myself included, have very real concerns about the Trump family’s use of crypto technologies to evade oversight, hide shady financial dealings, and personally profit at the expense of everyday Americans,” said Sen. Mark Warner in a statement before the May 19 vote, adding: “But we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay.”Senator Chris Murphy, who voted against advancing the GENIUS Act, called for bipartisan support in amending the bill to specifically bar a US president from issuing stablecoins. He also called on the White House to release a complete list of attendees to the memecoin dinner, suggesting that some or all of them would “try to get something from the president” in exchange for purchasing the tokens. Murphy and Senator Elizabeth Warren will attend a press event with representatives for Public Citizen on May 22. California Representative Maxine Waters, ranking member of the US House Financial Services Committee, announced a separate press conference for the same day, with plans to introduce a bill to “block Trump’s memecoin and stop his crypto corruption, once and for all.”As of May 21, the exact number of attendees to the dinner was unknown. A smaller group of 25 tokenholders also qualified to apply for “VIP tour” and reception — presumably at the White House — with Trump, but the complete list of those planning to attend was also unknown at the time of publication.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/protest-donald-trump-memecoin-dinner?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-21T17:02:48.000Z,"Is Bitcoin price close to a cycle top? — 5 indicators that help traders decide","Key takeaways:Bitcoin market cycle tops are notoriously hard to time, but combining technical and behavioral indicators can offer strong signals.The MVRV-Z Score, Pi Cycle Top indicator, trade volume trends, Puell Multiple, and exchange inflows accurately predict Bitcoin price cycle tops.Bitcoin (BTC) might be approaching the final stage of its current market cycle — a dramatic final rally followed by a sharp correction and, eventually, a bear market. For many, this could be the long-awaited climax of the past four years, and major players are preparing accordingly.Since late 2024, Bitcoin whale accumulation has surged. Glassnode data shows that the number of addresses holding over 100 BTC has jumped by almost 14%, reaching 18,200 — a level not seen since 2017. The biggest market players appear to be positioning for what could be this cycle’s final run-up.Number of BTC addresses holding over 100 BTC. Source: GlassnodeHowever, riding the rally is trickier than it looks and knowing when to exit is notoriously difficult. The lure of higher price highs fuels FOMO, driving investors to buy the top, only to face painful drawdowns or even liquidations.So, how can traders and investors spot the top before the market enters recession?Bitcoin cycle top markersSeveral technical and onchain indicators, such as MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Z-score, Pi Cycle Top, and trading volume trends, have historically been reliable in signaling when Bitcoin is nearing its peak.The MVRV-Z score compares Bitcoin’s market value to its realized value and adjusts for volatility. A high Z-score suggests Bitcoin is significantly overvalued relative to its historical cost basis. When this indicator is at a historical high, the ensuing downward trend in Bitcoin prices is likely.The Pi Cycle Top tracks BTC price dynamics using moving averages. When the 111-day moving average (111-SMA) crosses above twice the 350-day average (350-SMAx2), it signals overheating. In other words, when the short-term trend catches up to the long-term trajectory, a market top is in.Historically, all previous Bitcoin bull runs started with a notable surge in MVRV Z-score, and ended with 111-SMA crossing the longer-term trend.BTC: Pi Cycle Top + MVRV Z-score. Source: Marie Poteriaieva, GlassnodeAdditionally, lower trading volumes during price increases can be a warning sign, often signaling weakening momentum and potential for a reversal. On-balance volume (OBV), which registers cumulative volume flow, is a valuable metric for tracking this process. When OBV diverges from the price action, it is often an early reversal signal. The second leg of the 2021 bull run was a great example. While BTC price was hitting higher highs of $68,000 (compared to the previous all-time high of $63,170), trading volumes moved in a different direction, decreasing from 710,000 BTC to 628,000 BTC. This created a bearish divergence between price and volume, suggesting that fewer market participants were supporting the rally — a classic sign of waning momentum.BTC/USD 1-day, OBV. Source: Marie Poteriaieva, TradingViewProfit-taking metricsAs market cycle tops approach, long-term holders and Bitcoin miners often start locking in profits. Some valuable metrics that can track it are the Puell Multiple and exchange flows.The Puell Multiple Indicator looks at miners' revenue relative to its 365-day average. High readings indicate miners may start selling aggressively, and are often seen near market tops.Large inflows to exchanges are usually signs of distribution, as investors prepare to sell their coins. BTC total transfer volume to exchanges + Puell Multiple.

Combined, they often align with cycle tops.Related: Sorry bears — Bitcoin analysis dismisses $107K BTC price double topThe 15% ruleHistoric price activity observations might come in handy, too. Crypto market analyst Cole Garner shared his exit playbook based on whales’ behavior. His roadmap includes three steps:Euphoria. Bitcoin moves vertically for weeks, with massive $10,000+ daily candles.Whiplash. Bitcoin experiences its sharpest correction of the bull cycle. The curved parabolic trendline that’s supported the rally is broken — a clear signal that the top is likely in. Meanwhile, altcoins and meme tokens may continue pumping a little longer.Complacency. Measure 15% below Bitcoin’s all-time high. That’s the sell zone. Order books on major exchanges often show a wall of sell orders around this level — a likely institutional exit point.According to Garner, the 15% (or 16%) rule works not only in crypto but in traditional markets as well.Historical blow off-tops: BTC, ETH, gold, Nasdaq, Nikkei, Broadvision, 3D Systems.

In a May 21 social media post that begins with, “The Empire Lobbies Back,” Campbell claimed that the banking industry is especially alarmed by the potential for stablecoins to offer interest or rewards to holders. In a pointed message aimed at Democratic lawmakers, Campbell wrote that “banks want you to protect their cartel so they can keep screwing your voters.” He went on to explain how fractional reserve banking enables banks to maximize profits while offering depositors minimal interest.The banking lobby says that if stablecoins pay interest or any other type of monetary reward, banks will be “harmed,” Campbell added.An excerpt of Campbell’s X post.
