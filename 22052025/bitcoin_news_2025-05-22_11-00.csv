2025-05-22T08:55:08.000Z,"Bitcoin Headed for Smooth Landing Above $130,000, Expert Predicts","The largest cryptocurrency by market cap reclaimed the $100,000 price mark over a week ago and has managed to sustain momentum above that level. Interestingly, Bitcoin’s near-term price outlook remains bullish , as market experts have spotted key market patterns that further strengthen the leading asset’s already optimistic outlook. More recently, the pseudonymous analyst TradingShot shared a post to TradingView, a crypto data provider, in which he highlighted how “Bitcoin has unfolded a very interesting pattern since its April 07 bottom.” As the analyst asserted, since the asset’s bottom at $74,500, the big bull has continuously targeted all 10k intervals above it, from $74,000 to $84,000 and $94,000. Notably, the asset is now hovering around the $104,000 mark. Upon hitting the aforementioned price levels, Bitcoin witnessed a price consolidation, forming what the analyst calls a “structured Channel Up.” While the “Channel Up” may not be sustained long-term, its consistency thus far suggests that the asset could go on to target price levels above the $100,000 mark, with key prices sitting at $114,000, $124,000, and $134,000. “If this pattern continues to hold for as much time as it has since the bottom, then we may see $134k by late June/ early July.” The analyst wrote as a conclusive observation. Although Bitcoin is slightly down from its all-time high of $109,114, Bitcoin bulls have soared by 22.68% in the last 30 days. During the time of this report, Bitcoin is trading at a press time price of $103,596, with only 0.15% in weekly losses and 0.01% worth of gains sustained over the last hour. It is worth noting that the global cryptocurrency market is trading upwards, with a total market cap valuation of $3.49 trillion and gains over the last 24 hours sitting at 3.97%.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-headed-for-smooth-landing-above-130000-expert-predicts/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Cryptocurrency|Markets|News|Bitcoin News|BTCUSD|BTCUSDC|BTCUSDT|Cryptocurrency News|XBTUSD",cryptocompare

Hence, we expect the BTC price to create a 2025 high of ~$168,000. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $71,827.81 $119,713.02 $167,598.22 Bitcoin Price Prediction May 2025 In May 2025, Bitcoin’s unstoppable ascent shows no signs of slowing. After recovering from a brief dip triggered by President Trump’s trade deal announcement, BTC has surged to a new all-time high, trading above $110,000, setting the stage for what could be the most significant leg of the 2025 rally. Market sentiment remains highly optimistic. The BTC long/short ratio currently stands at 1.0375, indicating that long positions are outpacing shorts — a clear sign of growing bullish momentum. With this surge, Bitcoin has decisively flipped its previous all-time high and entered price discovery mode. Based on prevailing bullish indicators, BTC is eyeing a short-term target of $120,000, with the potential for even higher levels in the coming months. However, a failure to reach the short-term target could trigger a pullback to $100,000 or lower. Supporting this cautious view, on-chain data reveals that a substantial amount of dormant Bitcoin, unmoved for 5 to 7 years, has recently become active. This kind of movement is often interpreted as a bearish signal, suggesting that long-term holders might be preparing to sell. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 A key factor driving the potential for higher Bitcoin prices is the relationship with global liquidity. Historical trends reveal that as global M2 increases, Bitcoin often experiences dramatic price surges. Now, with global liquidity beginning to rise again after a prolonged period of stagnation, the stage seems set for another major rally in Bitcoin’s value. This shift in liquidity could create the perfect environment for Bitcoin to soar once more. Also, cryptoquant data suggest that accumulation is on top with exchange reserve declining at more alarming rates. When writing 2.4 Milliion BTC were in total on the exchange reserves, which is a strong decline from a year ago when reserves were 3.1 Million BTC.

Binance’s CZ Has An Advice For You appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin recently hit a new all-time-high after it rose nearly 3.5% to $111,880. Bitcoin’s market cap is now approaching $2.2 trillion, surpassing Amazon. Amid these exciting times, Binance former CEO Changpeng Zhao was quick to react to Bitcoin’s all-time high. According to him, investors who sold their tokens when the price was $77,000, missed out on big profits. He also had advice and suggested looking at long-term trends instead of getting caught up in short-term price changes. Investor Fred Krueger shared that once the $110,000 level is breached, there won’t be any blocking and it will be a smooth path straight to $150,000. Bitcoin ETFs See $3.6B Inflows in May, Institutional Interest Rises As Bitcoin broke past the $110,000 mark, spot ETFs recorded big gains. Investors poured in $608.99 million in new capital, pushing the total net asset value of all BTC spot ETFs to $129.02 billion as per data from SoSovalue . The demand is not just from crypto funds or retail traders, as public companies are now looking at BTC as a treasury asset.

QCP traders shared that a breakout to further highs may spark fresh FOMO and bring retail investors back which will push the prices higher.. Ryan Lee from Bitget predicts Bitcoin could surge to $180,000 by year-end, driven by strong spot ETF inflows, slower supply after halving, and rising institutional adoption. He highlights Moody’s recent U.S. credit downgrade as a major catalyst, that has boosted Bitcoin and Ether’s appeal as safe havens against fiat risk. Golden Cross is Here; $113,000 Next? Expert Benjamin Cowen points out that today is Bitcoin’s golden cross, a bullish signal where the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average. It remains to be seen if this could push BTC to hit $113,000 next. The Golden Cross is expected around May 22–23. Historically, this move often leads to a 10–15% pullback, even in strong bull markets.If Bitcoin dips but holds above $95K, then the uptrend will likely continue. But if it fails to break above $110K again by mid-June, then we could see a weaker Q3 and a possible retest of lower support levels. Analyst Ali Martinez shared that Bitcoin is hitting new all-time highs and entering price discovery mode.

According to a market expert, the second half of the month looks even more promising for the altcoin. In a recent post shared with X, prominent pseudonymous analyst Ali_Charts shared a potential scenario for the 9th-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The analyst forecasted $1 as a potentially attainable near-term price point for ADA bulls. As depicted in his ADA technical chart, which dates back to December 2024, a long-term bullish formation signals a possible price hike to the $1 mark. However, the analyst asserted that this scenario is only attainable if bulls successfully break above the $0.81 resistance level. Once the hurdle is crossed, ADA bulls could target $1 as the next price mark for the altcoin. The analyst wrote, “If Cardano ADA breaks above the $0.81 resistance, it could set its sights on $1.” If #Cardano $ADA breaks above the $0.81 resistance, it could set its sights on $1. pic.twitter.com/cigCc7NFwG — Ali (@ali_charts) May 15, 2025 While failure to break resistance has sent the bulls below the $0.80 price mark, the possibility of a retest is still very likely, as the bulls have managed to contain extreme selling pressure.

Bulls have notably sustained a slow but steady recovery over the past month, with 30-day gains soaring above 27%. Alongside the positive technical outlook for ADA, another fundamentally bullish uptrend has been spotted in the broader Cardano market. According to data from Taptools, the odds of ADA receiving a spot ETF have soared by 45% since the start of the year, signaling a rise in institutional interest in altcoin ETFs.

MANTA Chart on TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, Manta’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.294, resulting in a correction to $0.258. Is MANTA a good investment? Manta’s rapid rise in DeFi TVL charts and alignment with Ethereum ‘s scaling roadmap via technologies like Manta Pacific suggest $MANTA’s potential. Grants support its ecosystem growth, and it leads in ZK technology adoption, promising for blockchain ‘s future. However, regulatory concerns over transaction privacy could affect its long-term viability, potentially impacting ZK protocols like $MANTA. Overall, Manta is a good investment if you want a profitable return in the long term. Why is the Manta price up today? Manta price has triggered a strong bullish rally toward the high of $0.32. This occurred after buyers strongly accumulated around recent lows of $0.26. Will Manta price recover? If bulls hold the price above $0.3, we might see further recovery toward immediate resistance channels. Will Manta price reach $10? In recent months, the Manta network expanded its offerings and established multiple partnerships. If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $10 mark. Will Manta reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment, the MNT price might take several years to reach the $100 milestone. We expect the Manta price to achieve $100 by 2060. Will Manta reach $1000? $1000 is a distant dream for Manta price. However, if everything remains in favor of the altcoin market, we might even see the MNT price hitting $1K. Is Manta a good long-term investment? Investors are bullish on Manta, which has gained significant attention in recent months. If developers continue to build robust utilities for Manta and the roadmap fulfills user demand, it can be a good long-term investment option. Recent MANTA news/ opinions Kenny Li, one of the co-founders of Manta Network, was recently almost tricked by a phishing scam carried out by the well-known hacking group Lazarus. He talked about the incident in a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Friday, describing how he came very close to being caught but managed to avoid it just in time. MANTA price prediction May 2025 If the altcoin market witnesses a surge in buying pressure this month, we might see a rebound in the MANTA price. In May, we expect Manta’s price to record a minimum of $0.17 and a maximum of $0.37. The average price is expected to be around $0.25. Manta Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Manta Price Prediction May 2025 $0.17 $0.25 $0.37 Manta price prediction 2025 Due to the impact of Bitcoin’s halving, Bitcoin and leading altcoins could reach new highs in 2025.

2025-05-22T08:37:08.000Z,"Bitcoin Hits a New Record, But When Will the Big Altcoin Bull Run Begin? Analyst Reveals Conditions","Cryptocurrency analyst Simeon Koch made striking statements about the possibility of an altcoin season by evaluating the current macroeconomic conditions. According to Koch, Bitcoin and altcoin markets are currently under serious pressure. The main reason for this is that interest rates on US government bonds are at their highest levels in recent years. “Bitcoin and altcoins have a big problem right now: US government bond yields are higher than they have been in a long time. Historically, that has been very negative for risky assets like cryptocurrencies,” Koch said, adding that high bond yields indicate economic uncertainty, tight monetary policy and weak investment appetite. These three factors negatively affect Bitcoin and altcoins because these assets usually gain value during periods of quantitative easing and when investors’ risk appetite is high. Koch states that high interest rates pose a threat to the economic health of the US in particular. Moreover, despite Donald Trump’s crypto-friendly stance, this picture is straining the US economy. In the bond market, interest rates and bond prices are inversely proportional. If investors lose confidence in bonds and sell them, prices fall and interest rates rise. This increases the government's borrowing costs. Recently, the credit rating agency Moody's downgraded the US credit rating from AAA to AA1. This step accelerated the loss of confidence in the market. Although Fitch (2011) and S&P (2023) had previously taken similar steps, Moody's decision was also enough to shake investors' confidence. High interest rates make it harder for both the government and the private sector to borrow. By 2025, the U.S. will have about $9.2 trillion in debt coming due and will need to be refinanced with new bonds. But current high interest rates make that process prohibitively expensive. Related News: New Development in GENIUS Bill That Will Determine the Fate of Cryptocurrencies in the US Koch says the U.S. has three potential paths to lower high bond yields: Boosting economic optimism: Strong economic data can boost investor confidence and stimulate bond demand. FED's interest rate cut: By lowering the policy rate, the relative attractiveness of existing bonds increases. FED returns to bond-buying program (Quantitative Easing): Large purchases of bonds from the market artificially push interest rates down. According to Koch, all three scenarios could create a bullish wave in risky assets, especially altcoins, as periods of monetary easing have historically heralded bull markets for cryptocurrencies. “Currently, there may be uncertainty in the bond markets. However, if this uncertainty is resolved, there is a high potential for us to see a sharp rally in the Bitcoin and altcoin markets. We need to be patient,” he concluded. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Bitcoin Hits a New Record, But When Will the Big Altcoin Bull Run Begin?

2025-05-22T08:35:48.000Z,"Bitcoin 'looks exhausted' as next bear market yields $69K target","Key points: Bitcoin all-time highs matter little to those seeing a BTC price correction as long overdue. Both the latest surge and the bull market itself are on borrowed time, traders say. Comparisons to previous price cycles remain in use despite the booming institutional investment scene. Bitcoin ( BTC ) traders are calling for a pullback after all-time highs and seven “green” weekly candles. BTC price momentum continues to be met with skepticism as commentators assume that lower levels will come next. BTC price roadmap prepares for Q4 “cycle peak” Bitcoin hit its highest-ever levels this week, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView confirmed — but despite being up by a third in Q2 already, BTC/USD remains unconvincing for many. Long-term analysis suggests that not only is price action due to return lower to consolidate gains, but that the entire bull market is near completion. Among the latest prognoses calling for a “sanity check” is that of trading resource Stockmoney Lizards. In one of its latest posts on X , it brought back a bull market roadmap from late 2023. #Bitcoin This is our personal roadmap for this cycle. The most important key takeway message: 1.

The chart itself shows Bitcoin’s next “cycle peak” coming in Q4 this year, with the subsequent bear market taking BTC/USD back to 2021 highs of $69,000. Others referenced historical BTC price action to argue for a more imminent correction. Trader Crypto Chase noted that the price is now considerably higher than some typical bull market exponential moving averages (EMAs). “Every time price deviates FAR outside the EMAs (circled areas), we always see a pullback,” he told X followers. “Even if that pullback if brief before more upside, it's a pullback.” BTC/USD 1-week chart with 21, 50 EMA.

2025-05-22T08:33:39.000Z,"Pakistan forms new regulatory body to oversee blockchain and crypto","Pakistani lawmakers have endorsed the creation of a regulatory body to oversee the country’s blockchain-based financial infrastructure and digital asset ecosystem. Dubbed the Pakistan Digital Assets Authority (PDAA), the Ministry of Finance has approved its formation to supervise licensing, compliance, and innovation across the digital asset sector, according to a May 21 report from state-owned broadcaster PTV. The body will be responsible for monitoring operations of related entities such as crypto exchanges, custodians, digital wallets, tokenization services, stablecoins, and decentralized finance protocols. According to Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, the PDAA is part of a broader strategy to place Pakistan at the forefront of financial innovation. He stressed that Pakistan must “regulate not just to catch up — but to lead,” adding that the new body will help protect consumers, attract global investment, and develop a “future-ready framework” for digital finance. Beyond market oversight, the PDAA is expected to play a central role in tokenizing national assets and government debt, facilitating Bitcoin mining through monetization of surplus electricity, and enabling local startups to build blockchain-based solutions at scale. You might also like: New York City to establish crypto advisory council, says Mayor Eric Adams As previously reported by crypto.news, Pakistan’s Power Division began consultations in March with key stakeholders to explore competitive electricity pricing models for emerging industries, including digital assets, without resorting to subsidies. Power Minister Awais Leghari has also held discussions with Bilal Bin Saqib, CEO of the newly established Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC), to assess how global crypto mining firms could utilise the country’s surplus electricity. A little over two years after former minister Aisha Ghaus Pasha insisted Pakistan would not legalize cryptocurrencies , the launch of the PDAA signals a dramatic rethink of the country’s position. For years, the State Bank of Pakistan had maintained a cautious position, warning against cryptocurrency use and deeming assets like Bitcoin illegal tender. However, that stance began to soften in late 2024 when the government proposed amendments to the SBP Act allowing the central bank to issue digital currency and manage both physical and digital forms of money. Further signalling change, the Pakistan Crypto Council was established in March 2025 under the Finance Division to advise on digital asset policy. At the time, Saqib said that Pakistan is “done sitting on the sidelines” and wants to attract international investment, highlighting the country’s “low-cost high-growth market” and a “web3 native workforce ready to build.” The following month, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao was appointed as Strategic Advisor, after high-level meetings in Islamabad with the Prime Minister, Finance Minister, and central bank officials. Pakistan is estimated to have between 15 and 20 million cryptocurrency users and currently ranks among the top 10 countries globally in crypto adoption, according to Chainalysis data .

2025-05-22T08:31:29.000Z,"Investors Flock to Bitcoin ETFs as BTC Hits New All-Time High","The inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs are driven by both institutional and retail investors amid BTC's rally to a new all-time high. IBIT alone absorbed over 4,900 BTC in one day. A trader named James Wynn also stunned the crypto world by building a $1.1 billion long Bitcoin position at 40x leverage on Hyperliquid, which triggered a buzz across trading communities. Meanwhile, Texas took a historic step by passing SB 21, which aims to create a state-managed Bitcoin reserve. BlackRock Leads Bitcoin ETF Inflow Stampede BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) saw a massive surge in activity on May 21, and recorded its largest single-day inflow in over two weeks. This was thanks to institutional and retail investors piling into US spot Bitcoin ETFs amid the rally in the crypto market. According to Farside Investors , IBIT posted net inflows of $530.6 million, which is just shy of the daily record of $531.2 million that was set earlier this month on May 5. Since April 9, the ETF has not experienced a single day of outflows. The most recent inflow figure is particularly striking when considering that IBIT absorbed 4,931 BTC in a single day. This is more than 10 times the amount of Bitcoin that was mined on the same day, which stood at just 450 BTC. In addition to this, IBIT also saw its busiest trading day since January, which is a signal of heightened investor interest and activity. Nate Geraci , president of the ETF Store, said that based on the trading volume, even higher inflow numbers could be on the way. Other spot Bitcoin ETFs also mirrored this bullish momentum. Across all 11 spot ETFs, the total net inflows reached $607.1 million for the day. The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) came in second behind IBIT, pulling in $23.5 million. Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas described the inflow spike as a “classic feeding frenzy,” and pointed to Bitcoin’s sharp price jump as the catalyst. Bitcoin’s rally extended into May 22, with prices reaching a new all-time high of close to $112,000. Balchunas added that ETF trading volumes are echoing the levels that were seen in January when Bitcoin last approached an all-time high, and many ETFs are expected to double their average inflow rates over the next few days. The recent surge in price and investment interest not only drove up ETF flows but also prompted wider speculation about Bitcoin’s potential in the current macroeconomic environment. Jeff Mei , COO of the crypto exchange BTSE, said that Bitcoin ETFs are becoming a go-to vehicle for investors looking to gain exposure to the asset, especially as the space attracted $3.6 billion in net inflows over the course of May. He suggested that this upward trend may continue and even accelerate, particularly if the Federal Reserve proceeds with interest rate cuts. Meanwhile, Jupiter Zheng, a partner at HashKey Capital, warned that as Bitcoin pushes into uncharted price discovery territory, more volatility should be expected. Zheng also mentioned ongoing geopolitical instability and economic uncertainty as driving forces behind the long-term investment appeal of Bitcoin. Bitcoin Trader Goes All In A crypto trader known by the pseudonym “James Wynn” shocked the market by expanding a 40x leverage long Bitcoin position to over $1.1 billion on the decentralized exchange Hyperliquid. This is likely the first-ever billion-dollar position on the platform. According to blockchain explorer Hypurrscan , Wynn’s trade is currently sitting on a $36 million unrealized profit, with an average entry price of $108,065 per Bitcoin. The move was made using a $28.4 million margin spread across multiple trades to build the enormous long position. The bold strategy attracted the attention of the crypto community, and market commentators praised the audacity of such a high-risk play. Crypto analyst Sigma^2 celebrated the milestone on X by stating, “He did it fellas. First position [on Hyperliquid] to exceed $1B,” while others described Wynn as either fearless or reckless. At press time, Bitcoin was trading hands at $110,982 after reaching a new all-time high of $111,861.22. The crypto king was also up by more than 8% on its weekly time frame. BTC price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Interestingly, on May 20, HyperDash data showed Wynn started to reduce parts of the long position as Bitcoin hovered around $106,000, suggesting some level of caution despite the aggressive leverage. Still, the overall position is still firmly intact, and the unrealized profit swung dramatically from a $16.3 million loss just days ago to a multi-million dollar gain in line with Bitcoin’s sharp rally. James Wynn X profile James Wynn, who claims to be both a high-risk leverage trader and a meme coin enthusiast, has only been using the Hyperliquid exchange for around two months. During that time, he deposited $4.65 million in USDC and executed 32 trades, including long positions on well-known tokens like XRP, TRUMP, PEPE, FARTCOIN, and TON. Hyperliquid runs on its own layer 1 blockchain, and offers a decentralized trading experience including spot markets and DeFi lending products. Now, this $1.1 billion long bet placed the platform under the spotlight. Texas One Step Closer to Holding Bitcoin To add even more steam to Bitcoin’s current momentum, the Texas House of Representatives approved SB 21 in a 101-42 vote, advancing legislation that will establish a state-managed Bitcoin reserve. The bill previously passed the Texas Senate 25-5, and now heads to Governor Greg Abbott, who can choose to sign it into law or issue a veto. The bill was authored by Senator Charles Schwertner, and it empowers the state’s comptroller to invest in cryptocurrencies that maintain a market cap above $500 billion for at least 12 months. This is a requirement currently only met by Bitcoin. Representative Giovanni Capriglione hailed the legislation as a landmark move, and called it a “pivotal moment” for Texas. If signed, Texas will become the second US state to formally establish a cryptocurrency reserve, following New Hampshire’s move earlier in May when Governor Kelly Ayotte signed House Bill 302 into law. Texas had a gross domestic product of $2.7 trillion in 2024, and ranks as the second-largest economy in the United States. It would hold the eighth-largest economy globally if it were an independent nation. Similar efforts in other states have seen mixed results. Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs vetoed two crypto reserve bills on May 13, due to the volatility of crypto assets. Florida lawmakers also withdrew two proposed Bitcoin reserve bills on the same day New Hampshire passed its own, and Montana legislators rejected a reserve proposal over concerns about risk. (Source: BitcoinLaws ) According to the policy-tracking site Bitcoin Laws , 47 Bitcoin reserve-related bills have been introduced across 26 US states, with 13 more under discussion at the federal level.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9221/investors-flock-to-bitcoin-et-fs-as-btc-hits-new-all-time-high,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-05-22T08:30:08.000Z,"Despite 94% Crypto Awareness, Only 29% of Singaporeans Hold Any: Survey","Nearly every Singaporean has heard of cryptocurrency, but fewer are diving in headfirst, a new survey by MAS-licensed crypto exchange, Independent Reserve, revealed. Crypto awareness among Singaporeans has hit a new high of 94% . However, only 29% currently own or have owned crypto in the past year, down from 40% in 2024. “This decrease in crypto adoption comes as Singaporeans take a more defensive financial posture against the backdrop of global macroeconomic uncertainty,” a detailed report noted. The exchange surveyed 1,500 residents across Singapore in February 2025. Survey Reveals Shifting Sentiments in 2025 Independent Reserve claims that many Singaporeans are reallocating toward traditional investments. For instance, the share of respondents keeping cash in savings or fixed deposits has risen to 49% in 2025, up from 42% in 2024. “Investors are selectively managing risk and diversifying across asset classes in response to broader economic conditions,” the survey read. Mark Wong, Head of Trading at Independent Reserve, explains that the BTC/SGD pair dropped 19.3% from S$143,000 (US$110,832) in January to mid-April. “This decline reflects a broader pullback from risk assets,” he noted. Further, Wong said that Singapore’s crypto investors have shifted towards “high-quality assets” that maintain resilience in volatile conditions. “Painful lessons from speculative tokens have taught investors to prioritise robustness over hype,” he said. “Survey data reveals that investors holding two to five cryptocurrencies are most likely to report gains or break even, whilst those with eleven or more cryptocurrencies fare worse.” Besides, the trend is among the younger crypto users in Singapore, per the Straits Times report published last month . Though the ownership rate has decreased, younger generations, particularly Gen Z and millennials, are leading cryptocurrency adoption, with around 40% holding crypto. Crypto adoption is rising in Singapore, and younger users are leading it. Businesses are adapting, though challenges like usability, security, and limited merchant support continue to hinder widespread use. #Blockchain #CryptoAdoption https://t.co/9xPjW6dG76 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 8, 2025 Singaporean Investors Believe Bitcoin Would Surpass $250K by 2030 However, Bitcoin has been emerging as a possible safe haven amidst stagflation concerns. 68% of crypto investors in Singapore said they hold Bitcoin, and 23% believe that the world’s largest crypto will surpass $250,000 by 2030. Wong said that 59% of respondents favour Bitcoin over other crypto assets. “Even amongst non-crypto owners, it commands trust, with 52% favouring Bitcoin over stablecoins (48%).” Bitcoin set a fresh record at $109,487.23 on Wednesday , after witnessing a rising ETF inflow. The crypto is trading at $110.95 at press time. Additionally, the survey revealed that 28% of crypto investors hold a memecoin, with 43% of Singaporeans aware of at least one memecoin. “Memecoins are broadening the entry points into crypto. While they may not serve as core holdings, their cultural relevance has expanded the reach and accessibility of crypto for a new generation,” says Lasanka Perera, CEO of Independent Reserve.

He added that flow signals are also crucial. Hyblock’s cumulative volume delta (CVD) data shows that a breakout above +$250 million, especially if retail long positions stay below 35%, may confirm bullish continuation. On the other hand, dips below –$500 million in CVD with elevated retail longs have historically marked reversal zones. Rate Cut Expectations and Persistent Inflation Reinforce Bitcoin’s Appeal as a Hedge Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research in a statement to Cryptonews also noted that macro factors are playing their part in reinforcing Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge against inflation. He noted: Macro conditions are doing their part. Rate cut expectations and persistent inflation reinforce Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge, with many eyeing $113,000 as a realistic near-term target by June 2025. He further added that Bitcoin’s history shows us that sharp rallies often invite sharp corrections. A stronger U.S. dollar or fresh geopolitical tensions could easily knock momentum off course.

2025-05-22T08:15:14.000Z,"Coinbase hacker trolls ZachXBT after moving Bitcoin worth $42 million","The cybercriminal responsible for a theft campaign against Coinbase users has taunted on-chain investigator ZachXBT through an input data message on the Ethereum blockchain, Wednesday evening. The incident comes ten days after Coinbase disclosed the security breach, which reportedly compromised over 69,000 accounts. The mocking message was embedded in an Ethereum transaction, in which the attacker used the blockchain to send a short taunt, writing, “L bozo,” a slang phrase intended to ridicule ZachXBT by implying he had taken a loss. IDM Message posted by Coinbase hacker. Source: Etherscan The message also included a link to a YouTube meme video featuring NBA Hall of Fame James Worthy smoking a cigar to provoke the crypto sleuth. The interaction was first revealed by ZachXBT himself through his Telegram channel “Investigations.” He identified the attacker as the same entity behind a major breach at Coinbase, which exposed the personal data of thousands of users. Hacker identified in Coinbase breach As reported by Cryptopolitan on May 21, Coinbase acknowledged that the December 2024 security incident had affected approximately 69,461 customers. The breach was discovered on May 11, 2024. According to a filing submitted to the Maine Attorney General’s office, the company confirmed that personal data was exfiltrated. ZachXBT’s analysis connected the hacker behind the Ethereum taunt with the perpetrators of the Coinbase hack. Shortly after the breach disclosure, the attackers reportedly demanded a $20 million ransom in Bitcoin, threatening to release the stolen data on the dark web unless their terms were met. Coinbase refused to pay, opting instead to offer the same amount as a bounty for information leading to the arrest of the attackers. If you or someone you know were affected by this hack, please read my post to find a template you can use to start gathering information to build your case. Crypto gets a bad name from events like this, so we need to stand up for our friends and family and help make things… https://t.co/DIteoCHE1N — Ibrahim Ahmed (@atbeme) May 17, 2025 Meanwhile, unconfirmed sources have revealed that the individual also began liquidating stolen assets, converting 17,800 Ether (ETH) into $44.94 million worth of DAI stablecoins within a two-hour window, on Tuesday. The transactions were funneled through THORChain, a decentralized exchange protocol that allows cross-chain swaps without relying on centralized intermediaries. According to blockchain data, the hacker executed the swaps at an average price of $2,528 per ETH. One transaction saw 9,080 ETH exchanged for approximately $22.82 million in DAI. Coinbase struggles with financial and reputational damage The fallout from the breach has thrown Coinbase’s security reputation into question, clouding its entry into the S&P 500 index last Monday. The company is now facing a potential financial impact estimated between $180 million and $400 million. The costs are expected to arise from remediation efforts, infrastructure upgrades, and possible compensation to affected customers. COIN shares closed at $258.97 on Wednesday, a downtick of $2.41, or 0.92%, from the previous trading session. The stock has also fallen steeply in recent weeks, posting a 36.3% loss over the past month. Users are blaming Coinbase for its “sluggish” internal security protocols, particularly after revisiting chatter about the early warnings it received last year. Cybersecurity experts reportedly alerted the crypto exchange in December about suspicious activity targeting its clients. Similar threats target Binance and Kraken Five days after Coinbase filed their data breach report, Binance and Kraken, two other cryptocurrency exchanges, were also recently targeted in similar social engineering campaigns. These attacks also involved threat actors posing as users and attempting to bribe customer support agents. According to a May 16 Bloomberg insight , the attackers provided detailed instructions for further contact via Telegram. Both Binance and Kraken successfully thwarted the attempts. At Binance, artificial intelligence systems detected suspicious messages related to bribery. The exchange enforced policies that restricted access to customer information unless initiated by the client to prevent any exposure of user data. Kraken similarly reported no loss of customer data from the incident.

2025-05-22T08:14:42.000Z,"Top 4 blue-chip altcoins to buy as the crypto bull run starts","The crypto bull run has started, with Bitcoin sitting at a record high and most altcoins soaring. There is also a possibility that the altcoin season will start, as Arthur Hayes predicted it would start if Bitcoin hits $110,000. This article looks at the best blue-chip altcoins to buy and ride the crypto market bull run for maximum returns. Best altcoins to buy as the crypto bull run starts With Bitcoin price being in a strong bull run, altcoins will likely do well as the fear of missing out resumes. The best altcoins to buy are those with strong momentum, fundamentals, and technical patterns. Some of the top ones to buy are Monero (XMR), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Pepe (PEPE). Monero (XMR) Monero is the biggest player in the privacy crypto industry with a market cap of over $7.5 billion. It has the most momentum this month as its price jumped to near $400, its highest point since May 2021. XMR price has jumped in the last seven consecutive weeks and is focused on hitting its all-time high of $517.35. It has jumped as investors cheer a court ruling in the United States that found the government erred when it sanctioned Tornado Cash , a crypto mixer. This ruling led to a surge in privacy coins as it showed that they may avoid legal scrutiny. Therefore, there is a likelihood that some exchanges that delisted Monero will relist as its price surges. The price target for XMR price is $517, up by 30% above the current level. Solana (SOL) Solana will be one of the top beneficiaries of the next crypto bull run because of its vibrant meme coin ecosystem . All meme coins in the network are valued at over $14 billion, with the biggest ones being the likes of Official Trump (TRUMP), Bonk (BONK), Fartcoin, and Dogwifhat. Solana’s network thrives when there is a boom in its ecosystem as happened in January following the launch of Official Trump meme coin. SOL also has other catalysts, like the potential approval of spot SOL ETFs and the fact that some companies like Janover and Upexi have started to accumulate the coin. Ripple (XRP) XRP is another top blue-chip coin to buy and hold in the next crypto bull run. It has numerous catalysts that will help to push it higher over time. The most obvious one is that the SEC will likely approve spot XRP ETFs soon, allowing Wall Street money to flow into the coin. Further, Ripple Labs is in talks to acquire Circle, the creator of USD Coin, the second-biggest stablecoin globally. Ripple also aims to become a major disruptor in the payment industry that Swift now dominates. All these factors will make it a top cryptocurrency to buy when the crypto bull run starts. Pepe Pepe is another top altcoin to buy for the next bull run in the crypto market. It has become the third-biggest meme coin in the crypto market and one of the most actively traded. On top of this, it has some of the best technicals, as the chart above shows. It recently formed a giant double-bottom pattern at the lowest level this year. Pepe has also formed a bullish pennant pattern and is about to form a golden cross as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages have crossed each other. Therefore, the coin will likely continue rising and possibly retest the all-time high if the bull run gains steam. Pepe price chart | Source: TradingView Some of the other altcoins to invest in during the ongoing crypto bull run are Chainlink, Hedera Hashgraph, Fartcoin, and Popcat.

2025-05-22T08:09:56.000Z,"Bitcoin eyes rally beyond $150k as golden cross forms","Bitcoin is on the verge of confirming a powerful golden cross pattern, which could set the stage for a breakout rally toward the $150,000 mark. Bitcoin ( BTC ) surged to a new all-time high of $111,544 on Thursday, May 22, afternoon Asian time, breaking past its previous record of $109,400 from just the day before. This new high marks a 48% jump from the April 7 low of just under $75,000, making it the second all-time high for BTC in 2025. Alongside the price surge, Bitcoin’s market cap hit $2.2 trillion, while its realized cap also reached a new peak at $915 billion, highlighting how much value is flowing into the network. A sharp uptick in trading activity has driven the rally. CoinGecko data shows 24-hour volume surged to $73.7 billion, compared to $50 billion on Wednesday and $40 billion on Tuesday. That’s a noticeable jump, especially considering that earlier this month, daily volume had fallen below $30 million, its lowest since February. BTC’s futures open interest also hit a fresh record of $81.35 billion, up sharply from the $46 billion level seen in early March. That signals growing confidence from institutional and leveraged traders. You might also like: Bitcoin reaches new all-time high above $111K as macro tailwinds drive safe-haven demand Earlier this year, BTC faced strong headwinds as it tumbled more than 30% from January’s high of $109,588, bottoming below $75,000 in early April. That correction came shortly after President Trump hinted at new tariffs on major U.S. trading partners. But sentiment improved mid-April, especially after the U.S. reached fresh trade agreements with several nations. Another major factor driving the surge is the continued demand from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have seen over $7.4 billion in net inflows over the past five weeks, including $609 million just on Thursday. This has been backed by Bitcoin’s growing role as a treasury asset, prompting a wave of public companies to load the flagship crypto onto their balance sheets. Strategy, for example, has continued its aggressive accumulation , now holding over 2.7% of all Bitcoin in circulation. BTC technicals flash bullish patterns On the 1-day BTC/USDT chart, Bitcoin has flipped the 21-day EMA into support after weeks of acting as resistance. More importantly, the 50-day SMA (blue) just crossed above the 200-day SMA (green), forming the highly watched golden cross pattern. Historically, BTC rallied over 37% in just 3 months following a similar pattern in October 2024. BTC 50-day and 200-day SMA chart — May 22 | Source: crypto.news On the weekly chart, BTC has also broken out of a bull flag pattern, a classic bullish continuation setup where the price consolidates downward after a strong upward move. BTC has broken out of a falling wedge pattern on the weekly chart | Source: crypto.news The measured target of this breakout points toward $150,000, matching projections based on the flagpole height added to the breakout zone. If the golden cross plays out fully, the next realistic stop could be around $153,600. Veteran trader Peter Brandt acknowledged BTC’s new highs but reminded followers that hitting all-time highs is just what bull markets do. In an earlier May 1 X post , he predicted that Bitcoin could reach the bull market cycle top in the $125k to $150K level by Aug-Sep 2025, although he warned of a possible 50% correction afterwards. Meanwhile, analyst Gert van Lagen is far more bullish, predicting BTC could reach $300K to $320K by the end of the bull cycle. He based his outlook on a breakout from a 4-year Megaphone Pattern, which features widening price swings and often precedes sharp moves upward. Short-term risks still in play Despite the overwhelming bullish momentum, a short-term pullback can’t be ruled out. BTC’s RSI and Stochastic Oscillator have both entered overbought territory, indicating the rally may be due for a pause or short-term consolidation. BTC 21-day EMA and RSI chart — May 22 | Source: crypto.news If that happens, Bitcoin could briefly fall toward its support zone near $93,500, which lines up with its simple moving average supports. So, while a run toward $150K looks increasingly likely, it may not happen in a straight line. A short-term correction could offer a healthier setup for long-term gains.

2025-05-22T08:09:17.000Z,"Crypto Trader Opens $1.1B Long Bitcoin Bet on Hyperliquid Using 40X Leverage","A single trader has opened a massive $1.1 billion notional long position on bitcoin (BTC) using 40x leverage on the onchain decentralized exchange (DEX) Hyperliquid, a rare instance of a ten-figure position being open entirely on a blockchain-based platform. The trade is tied to wallet address “0x507,” belonging to pseudonymous trader “James Wynn” on the platform. Lookonchain data shows the position was opened at an entry price of $108,084, with a liquidation level just under $103,640 — meaning if BTC drops to that price, the position could be wiped out. The trade is sitting on over $40 million in unrealized profit as of early Thursday. Wynn closed 540 BTC (~$60M) in European morning hours to lock in a $1.5 million profit. Notably, his past three exits were followed by sharp BTC pullbacks and traders may want to watch for a repeat, Lookonchain said . Hyperliquid is built on its own high-performance layer 1 blockchain, HyperEVM, and offers features typically reserved for centralized platforms, like real-time order books, deep liquidity, and near-zero gas fees. Its consensus mechanism, HyperBFT, reportedly handles over 200,000 transactions per second, allowing traders to execute quickly and transparently. Unlike centralized exchanges that require KYC or restrict access, Hyperliquid allows anyone with a wallet to trade permissionlessly. The platform has rapidly gained popularity for its speed and capital efficiency, and this billion-dollar position may serve as a signal to other large players exploring onchain execution. In many ways, it also marks a new phase of capital migration from centralized finance to decentralized finance (DeFi) — one where whales, not just retail, are willing to place big bets outside the traditional system.

2025-05-22T08:06:53.000Z,"King Dollar Falls, Bitcoin Marches Toward Sound Money Highs","Bitcoin's BTC dollar high succumbed on Thursday as the largest cryptocurrency rose past $111,800 , a remarkable 50% gain from its April low near $75,000, but when measured against traditional stores of value like gold and silver, BTC — often dubbed \""digital gold\"" — still has room to advance. The bitcoin-to-gold ratio stands at 33.27 ounces, below its January peak of over 40 oz. BTC has also not reached an all-time high against silver, though it has just breached the 3,300 oz. level, compared with the record 3,530 oz. The digital gold moniker reflects bitcoin's fixed supply and decentralized nature, and it's increasingly living up to the name. In recent weeks, it has outperformed U.S. equities, which remain sluggish for the year despite recovering from their April tariff-tantrum induced downturn. In fiat terms, bitcoin is nearing significant psychological milestones across other currencies too. It currently trades around 82,500 British pounds, just shy of its all-time high of 88,300 pounds, and at 91,500 Swiss francs, versus a previous peak just under 100,000 francs. These levels hint at imminent breakthroughs as bitcoin gains further strength. Notably, BTC has already achieved all-time highs relative to major financial instruments like the Nasdaq 100 and the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT).

As the flagship crypto nears the next barrier, some analysts suggest that this cycle’s top isn’t in yet. Related Reading: SUI Preparing For Another Leg Up – Is $5 The Next Target? Bitcoin Hits New All-Time High On Wednesday, Bitcoin hit a new ATH of $109,800 after breaking out of the $107,000 short-term resistance, eyeing the $110,000 barrier as its next target. The cryptocurrency has significantly recovered over the last seven weeks, surging around 47% from its five-month low of $74,000 toward its current levels. Amid its May rally, BTC couldn’t break the crucial $106,000 resistance, trading between the $102,000-$105,000 range for nearly two weeks. However, its consolidation ended over the weekend as Bitcoin Weekly Closed above this barrier for the first time in history. Since reclaiming this crucial level on Monday, Analyst Ali Martinez pointed out that the flagship crypto appeared to be forming an ascending triangle pattern in the lower timeframes, which suggested a rally toward the $115,000 level once the price broke above the $107,000 mark. In the early hours of Wednesday, BTC’s bullish breakout saw it retest the $108,000 barrier, facing rejection toward the $106,000 support before bouncing and smashing this barrier and rallying toward its new ATH. Rekt Capital affirmed that the Second Price Discovery Uptrend is ahead for the cryptocurrency, as its First Price Discovery Correction is finally over. The analyst previously highlighted that Bitcoin would rally to a new ATH after Weekly Closing above its re-accumulation range and post-breakout retest. BTC Preparing For Another 20%-30% Jump? Analyst crypto Jelle suggested that BTC’s news target is around the $140,000 mark, pointing to a Power of Three (PO3) setup on Bitcoin’s chart. The pattern divides the price action into three phases: accumulation, manipulation, and distribution. In the first phase, a consolidation near the recent high occurs after a strong price performance. This is followed by a token’s price falling below the accumulation phase’s support level in the second phase, trading within a range below the recently lost zone. Lastly, the distribution phase consists of a strong price breakout, with momentum building and participants entering the market. Based on this setup, the flagship crypto started the accumulation phase during the Q4 2024 rally, entering the next phase during the March-April retraces. Amid its late April-May rally, Bitcoin has arrived at the setup’s final phase, with the analyst forecasting $140,000 as the next target after breaking above the $108,500 mark. Related Reading: Solana Rejected From Key ‘Inflection Point’, But Multi-Year Trend Suggests New Highs Similarly, Sjuul from AltCryptoGems highlighted the same Po3 pattern on BTC’s chart, affirming that investors could expect a “strong expansion” toward the $125,000-$130,000 levels after breaking out of its previous ATH levels. He previously pointed out that “BTC is clearly repeating the summer 2021 price action and trading in a perfectly bullish structure on high time frame,” which could suggest that the cycle’s top isn’t in yet.

2025-05-22T07:59:21.000Z,"MicroStrategy Records $15 Billion Profit as Bitcoin Hits All-Time High","The post MicroStrategy Records $15 Billion Profit as Bitcoin Hits All-Time High appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News MicroStrategy (MSTR) is back in the spotlight, and this time, it’s not just about Bitcoin buys. With BTC hitting a new all-time high of $109,500 , the firm is set to record a staggering $15 billion gain in a single quarter, positioning it for entry into the S&P 500 for the first time ever. But beyond the numbers, industry watchers like Jeff Walton believe MSTR is quietly shaping the entire crypto investment landscape. $MSTR is the apex Bitcoin accumulator. They've accumulated 324,000 BTC in the last 8 months That is 105,000 more Bitcoin than EVERY SINGLE company that has BTC on balance sheet COMBINED Lots of people sour on $MSTR 's future because of a single day of price action need to zoom… — Jeff Walton (@PunterJeff) May 21, 2025 The Apex Bitcoin Holder According to Walton, MSTR has accumulated 324,000 BTC in the last 8 months alone, an amount that surpasses the combined holdings of every other company with Bitcoin on their balance sheet by 105,000 BTC. This makes MicroStrategy the undisputed leader in corporate Bitcoin holdings . While short-term market swings may raise eyebrows, Walton urges investors to “zoom out.” He argues that MicroStrategy’s aggressive accumulation isn’t just about speculative plays, it’s about long-term structural shifts. “This ecosystem exists because of MSTR’s continued accumulation,” he said. Not Just Holding—Redefining Investment Infrastructure Walton further calls MicroStrategy the “500 lb Gorilla” of crypto, meaning it’s the biggest and most powerful player in the space. He believes the company can pull money out of traditional markets like real estate and bonds and redirect it into Bitcoin using smart financial tools like STRK and STRF. He also says MicroStrategy is “the moon that controls gravity,” meaning its moves have a big impact on the whole crypto market. When MSTR makes a move, it influences everything around it. Strong Performance Since the 21/21 Plan Since announcing its “ 21/21 plan” on October 30, 2024 , MicroStrategy’s stock has surged 63.9%, outperforming Bitcoin’s own 47.1% rise in the same period. While critics argue that the growth could be even better, Walton counters that the current trajectory is impressive enough and the future holds more promise. I’m sure a good chunk of the “negative on MSTR” folks are bots or engagement farming. I for one appreciate your signal though the noise right now . MSTR is the kind of stock I’d like to keep for decades and Saylor is building a foundation of granite to make this feasible. — News Reader (@2836P) May 21, 2025 He also noted that most of the recent FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) around MicroStrategy comes from low-engagement accounts, possibly bots or trolls, echoing the sentiment manipulation seen in stocks like GME. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : ‘America Is Not for Sale’: New Bill Targets Trump’s Crypto Cash-Grab , S&P 500 Entry Could Change the Game BTC ATH! $MSTR Q2 Pro Forma earnings With BTC at $109,500, $MSTR has ~ $15B single quarter gain Estimated EPS of Q2 ~ $54 per share (7.7 P/E ratio) This would qualify $MSTR for S&P 500 for the first time, leading to Billions of dollars in passive inflows Higher pic.twitter.com/XcdAmFMFMr — Jeff Walton (@PunterJeff) May 21, 2025 If Bitcoin keeps trading near its highs, MicroStrategy is set to report a massive Q2 earnings bump, which would be around $54 per share, with a price-to-earnings ratio of just 7.7. That kind of performance could finally push MSTR into the S&P 500, opening the door to billions in passive investment flows. And it wouldn’t just be a win for shareholders, it would also be a major validation of MicroStrategy’s bold, high-stakes Bitcoin strategy. It could be the spark that draws even more institutional players into the space. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Besides, the Hyperliquid (HYPE) price is also inching close to its ATH at $35. After maintaining consecutive higher highs and lows, the HYPE price is expected to trigger a 30% upswing in the coming days and mark new highs. The Hypeliquid price is marching strongly past $30 after breaking above the consolidated zone around $25. The rise reflects a massive increase in the trader’s confidence as whales and influencers are stacking, fueling a blend of retail FOMO and deep-pocket conviction. As the price surged, the Open Interest of the token also marked new highs which has reaching over $1.1 billion. An increase in the open interest suggests that new money or capital is entering the market, potentially signaling a continuation of the current trend. It also indicates that more traders are actively holding positions in a particular market. The higher open interest is considered a positive sign as it indicates greater market participation and liquidity. The historical chart of HYPE suggests the price is strongly heading towards the highs as it is working hard to secure the highs above the 0.786 FiB levels at $29.64. A daily close above this level is expected to keep up the trend, as the technicals also point towards a bullish continuation. The DMI has displayed a bullish divergence while the ADX is heading towards the upper threshold. Meanwhile, the RSI, which was consolidating along the upper threshold, is rising into the overbought zone. This suggests the Hyperliquid (HYPE) price is poised to maintain a healthy ascending trend and test the ATH at $35. With this, the price is believed to enter the discovery phase and eventually reach the 1.2 FIB at $42.15, marking new highs for the current price cycle.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/after-bitcoin-this-altcoin-could-mark-new-highs-in-the-next-48-hours/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Altcoins",cryptocompare
2025-05-22T07:45:48.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Record $72B in Futures Open Interest — Here’s Where BTC Could Be Headed Next","Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is up big, hitting $111,888 on May 21—just 1.3% off the January 2025 high of $113,369. The move is being driven by institutional activity, particularly in futures, where open interest has hit a record $72 billion . That’s 8% higher over the last week, which means big players are getting directional. Over $3 billion in short positions are concentrated between $107,000 and $108,000, which is now a liquidation cluster. If Bitcoin breaks $113,369, it could trigger a short squeeze and send price parabolic. Bitcoin futures open interest hit a record $72B today as institutional leverage climbs. Around $1.2B in shorts between $107 K and $108 K could be liquidated, boosting breakout odds. CME leads with $16.9 B in OI, while Binance follows at $12 B. pic.twitter.com/spdzrWek9G — Bitcoin News (@BitcoinNewsCom) May 20, 2025 “$108K flipped resistance into support. This structural shift could accelerate price discovery into the $117K-$120K range,” a senior derivatives analyst said. Key support has moved up to $108,000, which was previously resistance. This reassignment of support levels means more confidence in the market and is bullish in the short term. Golden Cross Formation Signals Potential Breakout Above $110,000 The technical analysis indicators are even more bullish with a golden cross coming on the daily chart. The 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) is closing in on the 200-day EMA—an event that has historically led to big upside. Bitcoin is about to flash a Golden Cross, shortly after a Death Cross. Insanely bullish. pic.twitter.com/M8oRuUfA1b — CryptoGoos (@crypto_goos) May 20, 2025 Golden cross has preceded 45-60% gains in past BTC cycles A close above $110,000 would be a 17% May gain Current monthly performance is nearly double the 10-year average of 9.2% If Bitcoin holds these levels into month-end, May could be the strongest month since 2019. That would be more evidence of demand and set up for fresh inflows into the second half of the year. Bitcoin Key Levels: $113K Resistance, $117K-$120K Target From a price structure standpoint, Bitcoin is still in a steep ascending channel that started in early April. The MACD histogram is still bullish but is flattening out—a sign that the move may need a consolidation phase before it extends. Resistance is at $113,369. A daily close above that would be a breakout and open up $117,141 and $120,913. If rejected, we could see a retest of the $108,000 breakout zone, which would be a re-entry point for trend followers. Resistance zones: $113,369 → $117,141 → $120,913 Support zones: $108,000 → $106,500 Technical signal to watch: Spinning top or rejection candle near $113K Short term momentum may pause at resistance but overall structure is still bullish as long as price is above $106,500 and the channel midline. BTC Bull Token Nears $6.98M Cap as 71% Staking Yield Drives Demand As BTC holding near $104K, investor focus is shifting toward yield-generating altcoins—none more so than BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The token has now raised $6.06 million out of its $6.98 million presale goal, with a price increase looming as it enters its final funding stretch. What sets BTCBULL apart is its flexible staking model, offering an estimated 71% annual yield with no lockups or withdrawal penalties. This approach gives investors the freedom to earn passive income while maintaining full liquidity—an attractive alternative to traditional DeFi staking protocols. Key Stats: USDT Raised: $6,062,795/ $6,981,682 Token Price: $0.00252 Staking Pool: 1.47B BTCBULL Yield: 71% APY BTCBULL merges the viral appeal of meme tokens with the real-world utility of DeFi, making it a standout pick for those looking to capitalize on the 2025 crypto cycle. With under $1 million left before the next price tier, entry at current levels is limited—fueling urgency among retail investors seeking early access to passive yield.

Two Papa John’s Pizzas, 10,000 BTC, and a Billion-Dollar Lesson appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Today isn’t just any other day for the crypto world. It’s Bitcoin Pizza Day , a quirky, legendary anniversary that marks one of the most famous transactions in financial history. And in a fitting twist, Bitcoin hit a brand new all-time high today, soaring to $111,861.22 — making this year’s Pizza Day extra legendary. Fifteen years ago, on May 22, 2010, a Florida-based programmer named Laszlo Hanyecz was craving pizza. Instead of paying in dollars, he made an unusual offer on a Bitcoin forum — 10,000 Bitcoins for two large Papa John’s pizzas. At the time, those Bitcoins were worth about $40. 15 years ago, Laszlo Hanyecz, a Floridian programmer, bought 2 Papa John's pizzas for 10,000 $BTC . Today, those pizzas would be valued at over $1.07B today. Happy #Bitcoin Pizza Day, everyone! pic.twitter.com/H7oeBTEIJM — CoinGecko (@coingecko) May 22, 2025 A fellow forum user accepted the deal, placed the pizza order using his credit card, and had it delivered to Hanyecz’s doorstep. What seemed like a simple food trade became a historic moment. Because if you check today’s Bitcoin prices, those same 10,000 BTC would be worth over $1.07 billion. Yes — two pizzas for a billion bucks. But it wasn’t about getting rich. Hanyecz was proving a point: that Bitcoin could actually work as money — something you could use to buy real, everyday stuff. And what better than pizza, the universal fuel for programmers and crypto enthusiasts alike? Since then, Bitcoin Pizza Day has become a fun, annual tradition. Every May 22, crypto fans around the world grab a slice, post pizza memes, and reflect on how far the industry has come — from an obscure internet experiment to a multi-trillion-dollar global market. So whether you’re a seasoned Bitcoiner, a casual crypto holder, or just someone who loves a good pizza story, take a moment today to raise a slice in honor of Laszlo and that legendary order.

2025-05-22T07:45:40.000Z,"Top 3 Altcoins Outperforming The Bitcoin Price This Cycle","This cycle, Cardano (ADA), FloppyPepe (FPPE), and Hyperliquid (HYPE) have emerged as standout altcoins, each set to outperform the Bitcoin price this cycle. Cardano (ADA) continues to attract long-term believers with its development roadmap, while Hypeliquid (HYPE) draws attention through community-driven appeal. Meanwhile, FloppyPepe (FPPE) has surged rapidly, capturing retail interest through viral traction and unexpected market performance. As the Bitcoin price climbs, it often signals the beginning of broader interest across the market , especially in promising altcoins that tend to outperform during bullish trends. These three altcoins mentioned above are highlighted as the best performers this cycle, with FloppyPepe (FPPE) standing on top. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The Meme Coin Built To Outpace Bitcoin (BTC) FloppyPepe (FPPE) is reshaping the meme coin space by combining viral culture with real, AI-powered functionality. It's tools like Meme-o-Matic, which instantly turns text into memes, and FloppyX, a video generator, that empower users to create and engage with content effortlessly. Inspired by Matt Furie’s legacy, FloppyPepe (FPPE) raised nearly $1 million in its private sale, moving over 5 trillion tokens in just 24 hours. This kind of early momentum has attracted attention not just from meme investors but from traditional Bitcoin (BTC) holders looking for high-upside altcoins this cycle. With a deflationary supply model and constant utility upgrades, FloppyPepe (FPPE) stands out among altcoins positioned to outperform the Bitcoin price this cycle, especially as social-driven tokens dominate short-term momentum. Low-Cap, High-Speed: Why FloppyPepe (FPPE) Is Dominating This Cycle FloppyPepe (FPPE) is gaining attention for its explosive early performance, with sharper returns than Bitcoin (BTC) in this cycle. While the Bitcoin price moves steadily, this altcoin surged in its presale, attracting thousands of buyers within hours, outpacing even top altcoins like Cardano (ADA) and Hypeliquid (HYPE) in early growth. With a presale price of just $0.0000002 and an ongoing 80% bonus using the promo code FLOPPY80, retail investors are flooding in to capitalize on its low-cap upside. This early traction fuels fast gain. While Bitcoin (BTC) anchors the market, FloppyPepe (FPPE) rides the wave of meme culture, speed, and scarcity, proving that in this cycle, agility and attention can outperform tradition. Analyzing Cardano (ADA)’s Technical Strength In The Current Bull Cycle Cardano (ADA) is showing steady technical strength in this cycle, which renews investor confidence. According to crypto analyst Ali, Cardano (ADA) is holding above $0.72 within an ascending channel, which could open the path toward a short-term target of $0.92 if support holds, especially as the broader market, led by Bitcoin (BTC), continues to gain traction. Another top analyst, Tyler Burke, forecasts a major breakout, predicting Cardano (ADA) could hit $8 by August 2025. Backed by continuous development and strong on-chain activity, Cardano (ADA) is positioning itself as one of the top altcoins, potentially outperforming the Bitcoin price as excitement builds around scalable, utility-rich blockchain platforms. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Price At Crossroads: Breakout Or Breakdown? Hyperliquid (HYPE) has shown impressive strength this cycle, trading near $25.82. Its rapid growth is fueled by surging trading activity on the Hyperliquid platform, attracting both retail and institutional interest. Despite its gains, technical indicators suggest that Hyperliquid (HYPE) may be entering a cooling phase as bitcoin price consolidation influences short-term sentiment. Recent price action shows Hyperliquid (HYPE) is struggling to break above resistance around the $27 level, forming a lower high and showing signs of weakness. If selling pressure continues for Hyperliquid (HYPE), a pullback toward the $21–$22 support zone is likely. This setup, while still within a broader uptrend, is unfolding in a market closely tracking the Bitcoin price. What This Cycle’s Top Altcoins Are Telling Us In a market where Bitcoin (BTC) often leads, some altcoins are rewriting the script this cycle. Cardano (ADA) brings long-term vision, and Hyperliquid (HYPE) shows short-term strength, but FloppyPepe (FPPE) is capturing momentum with both utility and energy, echoing the kind of breakout potential once seen in early Bitcoin (BTC) moves. Backed by a vibrant community and an active 80% bonus campaign, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is quickly positioning itself as a serious competitor to outperform the Bitcoin price. For those tracking high-growth opportunities, this meme-powered movement might just lead to the next altcoin breakout story.

2025-05-22T07:24:16.000Z,"The End Is Here: Robert Kiyosaki Sees US Collapse, Predicts Bitcoin Explosion to $1M","As the United States economy navigates the effects of President Donald Trump’s tariff policies, Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki has once again reaffirmed his support for Bitcoin. This time, the finance guru insists that “the party is over” and “the end is here.” In a tweet addressing the latest developments in the U.S. bond market, Kiyosaki affirmed that millions of Americans are about to be wiped out financially. However, those who hold bitcoin (BTC), gold, and silver will be safe. The End is Here: Kiyosaki The Rich Dad Poor Dad author claimed that no one showed up for the Federal Reserve’s auction of U.S. bonds on May 20, so the Fed bought $50 billion of the bonds itself. He called both the bonds and the U.S. dollar fake money. Despite Kiyosaki’s claims that no one showed up to the auction, data from TreasuryDirect shows that the Fed recorded over $69 billion in bids for its 42-day bills with a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.97. Regardless of the bond auction outcome, Kiyosaki’s message remains the same: buy bitcoin because the U.S. economy is collapsing. He claims the dollar is hyperinflated, and the end he has warned about is here. While the dollar faces the risk of collapsing, Kiyosaki believes the value of gold could surge to $25,000, while silver could touch $70. On the other hand, BTC could be worth between $500,000 and $1 million. At the time of writing, gold was worth $3,300, silver was trading at $33, and BTC shot up to a new all-time high today of over $111,000. Moody’s Downgrades U.S. Debt Kiyosaki’s latest doom forecast comes as the credit rating agency Moody’s downgrades U.S. debt from Aaa to Aa1. Aaa is the highest rating possible, while Aa1 is one notch down the scale. The agency cited a sharp rise in U.S. federal debt over the past decade due to a continuous fiscal deficit. According to Moody’s, federal spending has risen while tax cuts have declined, significantly increasing interest payments on government debt. This comes as successive U.S. administrations and Congress fail to implement measures to reverse the trend of annual fiscal deficits. Reacting to the downgrade of U.S. debt, Kiyosaki recommended that more people become entrepreneurs and invest in real estate as “America is in serious trouble.” Most importantly, saving in BTC and precious metals.

2025-05-22T07:22:11.000Z,"Michigan Lawmakers Introduce Four New Bills Targeting Crypto Regulation","Key Takeaways: Michigan introduced four new bills aimed at defining crypto policy and limiting federal control over digital assets. One bill would allow public pension funds to invest in Bitcoin through regulated exchange-traded products. Another bill proposes a state-level ban on supporting or promoting a U.S. central bank digital currency. Michigan lawmakers introduced four new crypto-focused bills on Wednesday, signaling a growing state-level push to define digital asset policy and limit federal influence over financial innovation. Rep. Bill Schuette (R-MI) introduced House Bill 4510 , which would authorize the state treasurer to invest retirement funds in cryptocurrencies, provided the assets averaged a market cap of at least $250 billion over the prior year. This effectively limits the scope to Bitcoin, which hit a record $111,000 this week. The bill mandates such investments be made through exchange-traded products managed by registered investment firms to ensure oversight. Another Bill Targets CBDCs A second bill, House Bill 4511 , sponsored by Rep. Bryan Posthumus (R-MI), targets federal efforts to roll out a central bank digital currency (CBDC). It proposes a ban on any state agency or department from supporting, testing, or promoting a U.S. CBDC. The legislation also seeks to shield digital asset holders from additional state-level restrictions or taxes. On the other side of the aisle, Rep. Mike McFall (D-MI) filed two companion bills—HB 4512 and HB 4513—focused on Bitcoin mining and environmental remediation. One bill outlines a “Bitcoin Program” that would grant private firms temporary rights to mine Bitcoin at abandoned oil or gas well sites, using leftover fuel. In return, companies would be responsible for site restoration. The accompanying bill offers state tax deductions for income generated through this type of mining activity. The program would be regulated by the Supervisor of Wells, who would oversee a public registry of eligible sites, conduct annual bidding rounds, and enforce restoration obligations. Michigan’s proposals add to a growing patchwork of crypto legislation emerging across the U.S. Earlier the same day, Texas lawmakers passed a bill to establish a state-run Bitcoin reserve. New Hampshire recently became the first state to authorize crypto and precious metal investments for public funds. Blackstone Makes First Crypto Move On May 20, Blackstone, the world’s largest alternative asset manager, made its first move into crypto markets , purchasing shares in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. According to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Blackstone acquired 23,094 IBIT shares as of March 31, valued at approximately $1.08 million. Prior to that, shares of Indonesian fintech firm DigiAsia Corp surged by over 91% on May 19 , after the Nasdaq-listed company announced plans to raise $100 million to initiate Bitcoin purchases as part of a new treasury strategy. The Jakarta-based firm revealed that its board has approved the creation of a Bitcoin treasury reserve. DigiAsia says it intends to allocate up to 50% of its net profits toward acquiring Bitcoin, signaling a shift in how it plans to manage its capital amid growing corporate interest in digital assets. Notably, public companies continue to increase their exposure to Bitcoin, with Michael Saylor’s firm, Strategy, leading the charge. The Virginia-based company recently announced it would double its capital-raising efforts to $84 billion in order to acquire more Bitcoin.

Here's the Latest Data","US-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded a total net inflow of $609 million on Wednesday, continuing positive flows for the sixth consecutive day. BTC Reaches All-Time High as $609 Million Inflows Into Spot Bitcoin ETFs This strong capital inflow coincided with Bitcoin breaking a new record, surpassing its previous peak of $108,000. The leading cryptocurrency is currently trading above $111,000. According to experts, Bitcoin’s recent surge is largely due to institutional factors, with major funds turning to spot ETFs and public companies raising funds for Bitcoin investments being among the main drivers of the rise. “Today’s demand is driven by institutional infrastructure and a clearer regulatory environment. Investor sentiment has now shifted significantly in favor of institutional-grade allocations,” said Caroline Bowler, CEO of BTC Markets. According to data provider SoSoValue, the largest portion of net inflows on Wednesday was made to BlackRock’s IBIT fund: a full $530.6 million. Other major ETFs, including Fidelity’s FBTC, Bitwise’s BITB and Grayscale Mini BTC Trust, also recorded positive inflows exceeding $20 million. VanEck, Ark & 21Shares and Valkyrie funds also finished the day with net inflows. The 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $7.64 billion in trading volume on Wednesday, the highest daily volume since Feb. 25. Net inflows of $4.24 billion were made to the ETFs in May, bringing the total cumulative inflow to $43.38 billion. HashKey Capital Partner Jupiter Zheng stated that with this rise, Bitcoin has now entered “uncharted territory” and volatility may increase in the coming period. According to Zheng, investors have now started to include geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties in long-term pricing. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin surged past $111,800 early Thursday, setting a fresh record. 15 years ago on this day developer Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 BTC for two Papa John’s pizzas, then worth roughly $40. The May 22, 2010, purchase marked the first recorded commercial transaction using BTC, a turning point that took the asset from cypherpunk code to actual currency. That same 10,000 BTC can buy over 70 million pizzas at current prices. It is worth over $1.1 billion as of Thursday. Hanyecz has long shrugged off the missed fortune” tag, telling CBS in 2019 that the transaction made bitcoin “real” to him. He mined the coins back when BTC was under a penny, and few could have predicted the multi-trillion-dollar asset it would become. Still, the transaction remains a cultural milestone for the crypto market — a moment that showed internet money could work as actual currency. Now, it’s not just pizza being paid for with bitcoin.

On May 21, the hacker used Ethereum transaction input data to write “L bozo,” followed by a meme video of NBA player James Worthy smoking a cigar. The message came after the attacker swapped about $42.5 million from Bitcoin ( BTC ) to Ether ( ETH ) via THORChain.

Related: DOJ is investigating Coinbase data breach— Report Coinbase hit with lawsuits after breach The Coinbase breach , first reported in a filing with the Maine Attorney General’s office, occurred in December 2024 and was discovered on May 11. The stolen data includes names, home addresses and other personal information. Following the disclosure, the attackers demanded a $20 million ransom in Bitcoin to prevent the release of the stolen data. Coinbase refused and instead offered a $20 million bounty for information leading to the identification of the hackers. The company estimates a potential financial impact between $180 million and $400 million due to remediation costs and customer compensation. Coinbase has also faced a wave of lawsuits following the revelation.

2025-05-22T07:07:07.000Z,"Crypto Conversations Surge as Bitcoin Breaks $107K and Altcoins Spark Heated Debates","The cryptocurrency market is once again generating a stir in the social media channels and forums it shares with the broader financial ecosystem, fueled by a recent upswing in the price of Bitcoin and a medley of new narratives around various other altcoins — narratives that range from levels of market sophistication seen before the last major crypto bubble, to political intrigue, to financial innovation. With Bitcoin having recently broken the $107,000 mark for the first time since January, much excitement has spilled over into discussions around several other big-name tokens. Attention has been focused once more on Bitcoin and on its fundamental role as a hedge against inflation and as a long-term store of value. Yet at the present moment, a rather mixed bag of assets—DeFi tokens, politically linked assets, stablecoins—are generating their own waves of conversation and speculation, not all of which is entirely sane. Bitcoin Eyes New All-Time High, Social Buzz Follows Bitcoin is still the leading topic in the cryptocurrency discussion as it nears what could be a new all-time high. After breaking through the $107,000 level, the number one cryptocurrency seems to have a renewed engagement on social media. The dialogue appears to have shifted back to some of its long-standing talking points, and they are as follows: 1. Long-term investment case (still valid, still holding strong, still a conversation point). 2. Ability to withstand macroeconomic shifts (Bitcoin “isolationism”). 3. Safety and soundness: decentralized, not controlled by anyone, and no one can mess with it. Renewed momentum has long-term holders celebrating, while new entrants wonder if they have missed the boat or if this is still a very early stage. Analysts are watching the institutional inflows closely and, in the context of inflation and global economic uncertainty, are drawing Bitcoin’s newfound status as a modern digital reserve asset into the appeal conversation. Altcoins in the Spotlight: From Politics to DeFi Innovation Bitcoin may yet lead the way in value, but a range of altcoins commands attention for reasons that go beyond price action. Among the most talked-about is TRUMP ($TRUMP), a politically charged token that keeps the waters stirred. Recently, a surge of media coverage and online chatter spilling over from discussions about Donald Trump, both in his capacity as former U.S. president and as a current player in global politics, has lent the coin an ever-increasing visibility. In the decentralized finance space, Aave ($AAVE) is making all the right headlines. The on-chain lending platform has posted stellar performance numbers—its Total Value Locked (TVL), by various estimates, is now somewhere between 25 and 40.7 billion dollars (for contrast, Aave’s all-time low TVL, in October 2022, was 6.7 billion). Its actual $AAVE token price has increased this past week between 15% and 25%, and the trading volumes have been very healthy—up between 35% and 50% (depending on the source) over this past week—across the three major exchanges. Overall, Aave provides a clear compliance pathway for regulatory acts like the GENIUS Act. As Bitcoin has climbed above $107K for the first time since January, teasing a new all-time high, these are the coins seeing the top rises in talks across social media: Bitcoin $BTC : Crypto's #1 coin breached $107K, closing in on a new ATH. Chats include long-term… pic.twitter.com/DeoHORxZaL — Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 20, 2025 Ankr ($ANKR), meanwhile, sits at a crossroads. Community sentiment has split, with some users expressing frustration over perceived delays and poor communication from the team. Criticism focuses on what some see as stagnation and unmet expectations. But others point to ongoing development, like integration with Neura and enhancements to token utility. They’re call for transparency and community engagement. Leader’s gonna lead. Stablecoins and XRP: Financial Infrastructure Under the Microscope The stablecoin sector is also creating a stimulating social media discourse, with USD Coin ($USDC) at the center of all the speculation. As a cornerstone of digital finance, USDC’s role is being analyzed and reanalyzed as the same old, same old conversation around USDC’s purported liquidity starts to bubble up again. Why? Because once again, people are asking whether USDC might be sort of kinda close to maybe, possibly, a stablecoin under threat from the same forces that seem to be threatening a lot of crypto: regulation and litigation. Now, XRP is becoming all the more relevant, and not by coincidence. The various converging factors influencing some recent price momentum make an up-to-the-minute look at XRP quite interesting. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity service, which uses XRP as a bridge currency, is now operational in 24 countries. The service, underscoring XRP’s cross-border utility, attracts very little of the front-line attention that is quickly funneled to Ripple’s many efforts to scale this product. Introducing XSGD, a Singapore dollar-backed stablecoin deployed on the XRP Ledger, and Ripple’s push into global payments and finance have made XRP a key player in the crypto infrastructure. The ongoing competition between Ripple and Coinbase in places like the institutional finance adds to the intrigue. Conclusion With Bitcoin almost touching its all-time high, the larger crypto universe is abuzz with talk, speculation, and even some intrigue. From DeFi breakthroughs and regulatory optimism to political narratives and stablecoin skirmishes, the market’s complexity is on full display. And all these stories, increasingly, seem to point in the same direction: That crypto, once a fringe movement, is quickly becoming a central force in the future of finance, and by some accounts, the future of politics and global technology.

2025-05-22T07:04:22.000Z,"Billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy Announces Plans To Acquire 75,000 Bitcoin Under New Corporate Entity","The financial services firm co-founded by billionaire entrepreneur and former US presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy entered into a strategic partnership to acquire a significant amount of Bitcoin ( BTC ). In a new filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Ohio-based Strive says it is joining hands with 117 Castell Advisory Group LLC to secure Bitcoin holdings at a discount price. The plan is to go after BTC claims that have already received definitive legal judgments but are still awaiting distribution. Strive is interested in the Bitcoin claims related to Mt. Gox. The now bankrupt crypto exchange operated between 2010 and 2014 and oversaw more than 70% of Bitcoin transactions at its peak. The Tokyo-based firm collapsed following a security breach that led to the theft of 750,000 BTC. The 75,000 BTC claims from the Mt. Gox estate are currently worth over $8.2 billion based on the flagship crypto asset’s price of $109,963. “This strategy is intended to allow Strive the opportunity to purchase Bitcoin exposure at a discount to market price, enhancing Bitcoin per share and supporting its goal of outperforming Bitcoin over the long run.” Strive submits the disclosure as it plans to team up with the social media marketing firm Asset Entities to form the first publicly traded asset management Bitcoin treasury company.

2025-05-22T07:00:59.000Z,"Bitcoin’s Momentum Is Back — But MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP Are Already Leading the Smart Capital Flow","As 2025 unfolds, the cryptocurrency market is witnessing a powerful resurgence in Bitcoin (BTC), but the real story is the strategic rotation of capital into MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA), XRP (XRP), and promising altcoins like Cardano (ADA) and Sei (SEI). While BTC’s dominance is undeniable, savvy investors are looking beyond the flagship crypto to maximize returns and diversify their portfolios. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Bitcoin (BTC): The Comeback King Bitcoin has reclaimed the spotlight, smashing through previous all-time highs and drawing renewed institutional and retail interest. With spot ETFs gaining traction and regulatory clarity improving, BTC has surged past $109,500. This rally is fueled by both macroeconomic uncertainty and Bitcoin’s status as a digital safe haven. As more investors adopt a “buy the dip” mentality, Bitcoin’s momentum appears set to continue, with the $110,000 level in focus as the next psychological milestone. MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA): The New Altcoin Darling Despite Bitcoin’s impressive gains, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the breakout star of 2025. As the leading political meme coin, MAGA has attracted over $8 million in presale funds and boasts a rapidly growing community of more than 20,000 holders. With a capped supply of 100 billion tokens and a presale price under $0.001, MAGA’s scarcity and hype have analysts projecting a potential 18,500% return on investment, with a $1 price target by year’s end if momentum persists. What sets MAGA apart is its blend of meme coin energy and structured tokenomics. The project’s HashEx-audited smart contracts and viral grassroots marketing have created a unique combination of credibility and excitement. As smart capital flows into MAGA, it’s clear that investors are seeking both high upside and community-driven narratives. XRP (XRP): Regulatory Clarity and Institutional Adoption XRP is enjoying a resurgence thanks to recent legal victories and the prospect of an XRP ETF. The resolution of Ripple’s SEC case has removed a major obstacle, paving the way for institutional adoption and new products like CME’s cash-settled XRP futures. Currently trading between $2.39 and $2.60, XRP is seeing increased whale accumulation and robust trading volumes. Analysts are optimistic, with near-term targets of $2.85–$3.40 and the potential for $5.50–$15 by year-end if ETF approval and adoption accelerate. XRP’s appeal lies in its utility for cross-border payments and its newfound regulatory clarity, making it a top choice for both retail and institutional investors seeking exposure to the next wave of crypto innovation. ADA and SEI: Quietly Building Strength While BTC, MAGA, and XRP grab headlines, Cardano (ADA) and Sei (SEI) are quietly attracting smart capital. ADA’s robust development ecosystem and attractive staking rewards make it a favorite among long-term holders. Meanwhile, SEI’s focus on high-throughput, decentralized trading infrastructure is drawing DeFi enthusiasts looking for the next big thing in blockchain technology. Both ADA and SEI benefit from the broader altcoin rotation as investors seek diversification and exposure to emerging narratives. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF Conclusion Bitcoin’s (BTC) momentum is undeniable, but the most strategic capital is already flowing into MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP (XRP), where early-stage upside and institutional adoption are fueling the next phase of the bull market. ADA and SEI offer additional opportunities for growth and diversification, rounding out a forward-thinking crypto portfolio for 2025. As the market evolves, these assets are set to define the smart capital flow and shape the future of digital finance.

2025-05-22T07:00:00.000Z,"Historic Day For Hong Kong: Stablecoin Bill Receives Legislative Approval","Hong Kong’s Legislative Council has passed the long-anticipated Stablecoins Bill, establishing a licensing regime for fiat-referenced stablecoin (FRS) issuers. This legislative move , announced by the Hong Kong government on May 21, aims to strengthen regulatory oversight on virtual asset activities, fostering both financial stability and innovation in the region. Ordinance To Regulate Stablecoin Advertisements And Issuers The newly enacted Stablecoins Ordinance mandates that any entity issuing an FRS within Hong Kong, or any FRS claiming to maintain a stable value against the Hong Kong dollar, must obtain a license from the Monetary Authority (MA). The licensing requirements will focus on several critical areas, including reserve asset management, proper segregation of client assets, and a robust stabilization mechanism. Additionally, issuers must ensure they can process redemption requests for stablecoin holders at par value under reasonable conditions. According to the government’s statement, these regulations are designed to enhance public protection and safeguard investors. Under the Ordinance, only licensed institutions will be permitted to offer FRS in Hong Kong, and retail investors will only have access to FRS issued by these licensed entities. To combat fraud and scams, the Ordinance stipulates that only advertisements for licensed fiat-referenced stablecoin issuances will be allowed, ensuring that the public is shielded from misleading promotional materials. Hong Kong’s Commitment To Digital Assets Mr. Christopher Hui, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, emphasized that the Ordinance follows the principle of “same activity, same risks, same regulation.” This risk-based approach aligns with international regulatory standards and aims to create a solid foundation for Hong Kong’s digital asset market , ultimately promoting sustainable industry development while protecting user rights. Echoing these sentiments, Mr. Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, highlighted the Ordinance’s pragmatic and flexible nature. He noted that a robust regulatory framework would foster healthy, responsible growth within Hong Kong’s stablecoin and broader digital asset ecosystem. The Stablecoins Ordinance is expected to come into effect later this year, allowing the industry ample time to familiarize itself with the new licensing requirements. Transitional arrangements will also be provided to assist businesses in applying for licenses and adjusting to the regulatory landscape . Looking ahead, the Hong Kong government remains committed to nurturing the virtual asset sector. Following the establishment of the regulatory regime for trading platforms and stablecoin issuers, the government plans to initiate consultations on over-the-counter (OTC) and custodian services for digital assets, along with releasing a second policy statement on crypto development.

2025-05-22T06:59:55.000Z,"Tom Emmer revives Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act that protects non-custodial developers","Minnesota Representative Tom Emmer has reintroduced the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act in Congress, with renewed bipartisan backing and industry support. The Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act seeks to clarify that developers and service providers who do not custody consumer funds, such as miners, validators, and wallet providers, should not be classified as money transmitters. By doing so, the bill aims to prevent these actors from facing licensing obligations under state or federal money services laws. Emmer, who co-chairs the Congressional Crypto Caucus alongside Democratic Representative Ritchie Torres, said in a May 21 notice that the measure provides “commonsense clarification” to protect innovation from being pushed overseas. He stressed that without legal certainty, the U.S. risks losing developers to crypto-friendly jurisdictions. Torres also echoed this view, describing the updated version of the bill as a “smarter, sharper framework” shaped by past feedback, offering clear rules without compromising oversight. “If we want to keep the next generation of builders in the United States, this kind of legal clarity is essential. We cannot afford to let outdated or misapplied regulations drive American talent and technology overseas,” he added. You might also like: Tom Emmer’s anti-CBDC bill clears US House Financial Services Committee Representative Emmer first unveiled the bill in 2018 to provide clarity around how non-custodial blockchain developers are treated under money transmission laws. Since then, it has seen multiple reintroductions . The most recent version prior to this came in 2023 as H.R. 1747 , but similar language was voted down in committee markup. Emmer and Torres say they’ve taken that feedback seriously and returned with a revised framework designed to address earlier concerns while still defending core innovation principles. Several industry advocacy groups have rallied behind the bill, including Coin Center, the Blockchain Association, the DeFi Education Fund, the Digital Chamber, and the Crypto Council for Innovation. According to Cody Carbone of The Digital Chamber, the bipartisan bill would “finally give [developers] the freedom to build in the United States.” The bill’s reintroduction comes amid rising political tension over digital assets, with several Democratic lawmakers growing increasingly resistant to crypto legislation, especially with scrutiny mounting over President Donald Trump’s ties to the industry. For the legislation to pass, it will need to secure majority support in both chambers of Congress, but it remains unclear whether Emmer and Torres have the necessary votes. While the bill has gained backing from key industry groups and bipartisan sponsors, broader congressional support has yet to fully materialize.

2025-05-22T08:37:57.000Z,"Dubai regulator clarifies real-world asset tokenization rules: Lawyer","Newly updated guidelines from Dubai’s crypto regulator include provisions on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and clarify rules for issuers. On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) released its updated Rulebook for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) operating in the region. The regulator gave market participants until June 19 to comply with the new rules. The regulator previously told Cointelegraph that it had enhanced supervisory mechanisms and brought consistency across activity-based rules. One of the more prominent changes includes regulatory clarity on RWA tokens. Irina Heaver, partner at the United Arab Emirates-based law firm NeosLegal, told Cointelegraph that the updated rules clarify RWA issuance and distribution. “Issuing real-world asset tokens and listing them on secondary markets is no longer theoretical,” Heaver told Cointelegraph. “It’s now a regulatory reality in Dubai and the broader UAE.”A “viable” path to realize RWA hypeHeaver compared RWAs to security token offerings (STOs), an earlier attempt from the crypto space to tokenize securities like stocks, bonds and real estate investment trusts. However, the UAE crypto lawyer said that STOs “died a peaceful death in 2018 to 2019.” The lawyer told Cointelegraph STOs did not work out because of the lack of regulatory clarity, viable secondary market trading venues, institutional investor appetite and liquidity. Still, the situation is different for RWAs. Heaver told Cointelegraph that RWAs are the next foundational layer for institutional adoption of blockchain and virtual assets. Heaver said that VARA’s new rules already cover them as Asset-Referenced Virtual Assets (ARVA) tokens. She said: “VARA’s newly updated Virtual Asset Issuance Rulebook (May 2025) addresses these failures head-on. Regulated exchanges and broker-dealers in Dubai are now authorized to distribute and list ARVA tokens.”The lawyer said this solves an issue in jurisdictions like Switzerland, where token issuance is possible, but listing and secondary trading remain unregulated. Related: Dubai gov’t agencies to link real estate registry with property tokenizationLawyer shares requirements for RWA issuersHeaver said ARVA tokens are defined under Dubai law as representing direct or indirect ownership of real-world assets, granting entitlement to receive or share income and purporting to maintain a stable value by reference to real-world assets or income. ARVA tokens are also backed or collateralised by such real-world assets or constitute a derivative, wrapped, duplicated, or fractionalised version of another ARVA. The lawyer said issuers must meet specific requirements, including a Category 1 Virtual Asset Issuance license, a comprehensive white paper and a risk disclosure statement. In addition, issuers must have a paid-up capital of 1.5 million UAE dirhams (about $408,000) or 2% of reserve assets held. The issuers are also subjected to monthly independent audit obligations and must adhere to ongoing supervisory oversight. “VARA is providing regulatory clarity, and it’s giving the industry a viable, enforceable path to turn the hype of RWA tokenization into reality,” Heaver told Cointelegraph. “This matters because it marks a shift, from theory to execution, from fiction to framework.”Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/dubai-vara-guidelines-rwa-tokenization-clarity?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-22T08:25:00.000Z,"5 red flags you’re being shilled: Don’t buy the hype","What is shilling in crypto?              At its core, shilling is the act of artificially promoting a cryptocurrency or token, often with exaggerated claims, to increase its price or popularity. But what’s the goal? Hype it up, get others to buy in, and then cash out, leaving latecomers holding the bag.Shilling can come from anyone: influencers, anonymous accounts or even high-profile figures with political or financial clout. The common thread is manipulation: It’s not about educating you or building real value but pumping hype for personal gain.Unfortunately, the line between enthusiastic promotion and outright deception can be thin, and many fall victim without realizing it. That’s why it’s critical to learn how to spot the signs early.                  5 red flags you’re being shilled              Beware of crypto red flags like overhyped promises, anonymous teams, influencer shills, missing products and FOMO tactics — if it smells like a scam, it probably is.1. Overhyped promises You’ve probably seen posts that scream:“100x potential!”“Guaranteed returns!”“This is your ticket to financial freedom!”These are classic shill tactics. Real, credible projects don’t promise life-changing profits. Why? Because there are no guarantees in crypto or in any investment.When a project leads with grandiose financial claims rather than actual product value or utility, it’s likely a ploy to stir FOMO and attract unsuspecting investors. The truth is, if something sounds too good to be true, it almost always is.Remember: The bigger the promise, the bigger the red flag.2. Anonymous or suspicious teams In crypto, anonymity isn’t always bad, but when you’re trusting people with your money, transparency matters.It’s a major red flag when a project has:No identifiable team membersFake names or aliasesStock photos on its websiteNo LinkedIn or professional history.The simple rule is “No face, no funds.”Scammers often hide behind anonymity because they know they’ll eventually vanish and there’ll be no one to hold accountable. Even worse, some use fabricated credentials or hire actors to pose as team members.Before investing, check whether the founders or developers have any verifiable history. Do they have prior experience in blockchain or startups? Have they launched anything successful before?3. Influencer spam and paid promotions One day, no one’s talking about a particular coin — the next, your feed is flooded with influencers hyping it up. Sound familiar?This sudden burst of attention is often coordinated with a paid promotion campaign disguised as “genuine enthusiasm.”Many influencers fail to disclose sponsorships, even though it’s required by law in many countries. The US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have cracked down on this in recent years.Take, for example:Kim Kardashian, who was fined $1.26 million in 2022 for promoting EthereumMax without proper disclosure.Floyd Mayweather Jr., who was sued for endorsing the same project at a paid event.BitBoy (Ben Armstrong), who faced legal action in multiple lawsuits for promoting scam tokens to his audience.If you notice multiple influencers promoting the same project in a short time, especially without using labels like #ad or #sponsored, it’s a strong indicator of a shill campaign.Don’t mistake volume for value. Hype doesn’t equal legitimacy.4. No real product or roadmapIf you visit the project’s website, it looks sleek, maybe even impressive. But where’s the product? Where’s the code?Shilled tokens often rely on flashy marketing but have no working application, no GitHub code and no actual use case. Everything is either “coming soon” or buried behind vague promises.Ask yourself:Can I use the platform or app today?Is there a white paper that makes sense?Do they have public repositories or open development?If all you’re seeing is a landing page and a vague roadmap that’s been “coming soon” for months, that’s a major red flag.5. Pressure tactics and FOMO Time pressure is a psychological weapon, and shillers know how to use it.Watch out for lines such as:“Presale ends in 2 hours!”“Only 1,000 spots left!”“If you don’t buy now, you’ll miss out forever!”These tactics prey on your fear of missing out (FOMO) and push you into making impulsive decisions without research.But crypto isn’t a sprint; it’s a long-term game. Anyone trying to rush you into buying likely has something to hide. Solid investments don’t need fake urgency.Take a breath, step back, and ask yourself: Am I buying because I believe in this project or because I’m being manipulated?Did you know? The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) secured a $128-million judgment against Ryan Mitchell Pope, Daniel Samuel Bishop and their company EmpiresX for operating a fraudulent forex and cryptocurrency investment scheme that defrauded over 12,500 victims.                  Is shilling illegal in crypto? Can influencers be sued?              Shilling isn’t just unethical in many cases — it’s also illegal.In the world of crypto, undisclosed promotions are a major legal risk. If someone is paid to promote a token or project but fails to reveal that financial connection, they could face fines, lawsuits or even criminal charges. This is especially true if the promoted token is later classified as a security under US law.Regulators like the SEC, FTC and CFTC have all cracked down on this behavior. Their targets have included:Influencers who failed to disclose paid promotionsPromoters who misled investors with false claimsIndividuals who ran pump-and-dump schemes using social media.Francier Obando Pinillo, a pastor from Miami, was indicted on 26 fraud counts for running a crypto scam through “Solano Fi,” defrauding investors of millions from 2021 to 2023. He allegedly used his church, social media and false promises of 34.9% monthly returns to lure victims. The platform showed fake gains but blocked withdrawals, while funds were diverted for personal use. Pinillo was arraigned in Richland, Washington and faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.As crypto becomes more mainstream, expect stricter regulations and more consequences for shillers.Did you know? Argentine President Javier Milei has dissolved the special task force investigating the LIBRA cryptocurrency scandal, a project he promoted in February 2025 that surged to a $4.5-billion valuation before crashing by over 97%. The task force, created by Milei himself, was disbanded via Decree 332/2025, citing that it had fulfilled its purpose. However, critics argue that no official findings were released, and judicial investigations into Milei and his associates continue.                  How to protect yourself from shilling scams              Do your own research, verify the team and utility, ignore hype and influencers, and stay alert to pump-and-dump schemes to avoid crypto shilling traps.Let’s understand how you can protect yourself from shilling scams in crypto:Do your own research (DYOR): Always research the project, the team behind it and the data supporting the claims. Don’t rely solely on hype or influencer recommendations. Look into onchain data, GitHub activity and the project’s utility to make informed decisions.Verify the team: A legitimate crypto project should have a transparent and credible team. If the developers are anonymous or have no professional profiles (like LinkedIn), that’s a red flag. Always check the team’s past projects and credibility before investing.Look for real utility: Does this project actually solve a problem? A genuine project should have a working product or solution, not just promises. Avoid projects that lack real-world utility or are still in “coming soon” stages for extended periods.Ignore the hype: If a token is suddenly trending on social media or being aggressively promoted, don’t let FOMO influence your judgment. Shillers often rely on emotions to push their agenda, so it’s essential to evaluate projects based on their merits, not just popularity.Stay skeptical of influencers: Influencers with large followings may be paid to promote certain tokens. Before taking their advice, ask yourself, What’s their incentive? Verify the promotion is legitimate and disclosed as paid or sponsored. Always cross-check the information with independent sources.Watch for pump-and-dump schemes: Be cautious of sudden price spikes followed by rapid drops. These are often signs of pump-and-dump schemes where the token’s value is artificially inflated by coordinated buying and then quickly sold off, leaving investors with losses. Always monitor price trends and be wary of sudden, unexplained increases in value.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/5-red-flags-youre-being-shilled-dont-buy-the-hype?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Seeker is the company’s second-generation device, after the Saga Web3 phone that launched in April 2023. The company unveiled the Seeker phone in September 2024, saying it wouldn’t just be a “memecoin phone.” So far, it has pre-sold 150,000 units.The Solana Seeker has gone through two sale phases: The Founder window, where the price for each device was $450, and the Early Adopter window, where the price per device was $500. Assuming the lower price window, Solana Mobile could generate at least $67.5 million in gross revenue from device sales. For comparison, the iPhone generated $199.3 billion in revenue for Apple in 2024.The new architecture that will govern future Solana Mobile devices is called TEEPIN, which stands for “Trusted Execution Environment Platform Infrastructure Network.” It is a three-layer architecture — hardware, platform, and network layers — that will allow users, developers, and device makers to participate in a trustless environment.Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder and CEO of Solana Labs, called TEEPIN “the next evolution in mobile” and a framework where trust is “verified by cryptography.”In addition, Solana Mobile is planning to launch “SKR,” the native asset of the Solana Mobile ecosystem. \""It transforms the traditional mobile business model by giving stakeholders actual ownership in the platform,” said Emmett Hollyer, general manager at Solana Mobile.

Source: TradingView / CointelegraphWhile excessive buying pressure on a single exchange is not necessarily bearish, it can make it easier to trigger unsustainable price surges when liquidity is low. This data supports the idea that derivatives markets were not the main driver of the recent price increases. Moreover, the $1.37 billion in net inflows to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States between May 15 and May 20 further suggests that spot buyers, rather than derivatives traders, were the primary force behind the rally.Despite the lack of conviction in Bitcoin futures, several indicators point to further upside. Forced liquidations of bearish BTC futures positions were relatively low at $170 million between May 18 and May 21, cementing the idea of a spot-driven rally. In comparison, the rally to $104,000 on May 9 triggered $538 million in liquidations over three days.Related: Is Bitcoin price close to a cycle top? — 5 indicators that help traders decideBitcoin options put-to-call ratio at Deribit.

The ETH/USDT pair is likely to pick up momentum on a break above $2,739. That clears the path for a rally to $3,000.Contrary to this assumption, a break and close below the 20-day EMA signals that the bears are back in the game.

The pair could rally to $3 and, after that, to $3.40, where the sellers are expected to mount a strong defense.BNB price predictionBNB (BNB) bulls have held the 20-day EMA ($639) support during the pullback, indicating buying on dips. BNB/USDT daily chart.

2025-05-21T17:55:00.000Z,"Interest groups, lawmakers to protest Trump&#039;s memecoin dinner","Democratic leaning organizations and members of Congress have announced plans to protest what they describe as the sale of access to the office of the US president, in reference to Donald Trump’s memecoin dinner on May 22. The event’s attendees are said to have collectively spent over $100 million for the chance to meet with the US president.Since Trump’s memecoin project, Official Trump (TRUMP), announced that its top 220 tokenholders would have an opportunity to apply for an exclusive dinner with the president, many leaders in the crypto industry and US lawmakers have criticized the event, saying Trump was opening his office to potential bribery and corruption. The memecoin dinner prompted some Democratic lawmakers to withdraw support for crypto-related legislation in Congress, including the market structure and stablecoin bills.“Trump collecting gifts from foreign governments is unconstitutional,” a spokesperson for the consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen, which is planning to protest near the memecoin dinner on May 22, told Cointelegraph. “Collecting foreign government investments through his memecoin is not much better. American foreign policy should not be for sale.”Source: Public CitizenCrypto industry figures such as Tron founder Justin Sun, Kronos Research chief investment officer Vincent Liu, Hyperithm co-CEO Oh Sangrok, and Synthetix founder Kain Warwick are among the tokenholders expected to attend the dinner at the Trump National Golf Club outside Washington, DC. The memecoin project said all applicants had to pass a background check and could not be from a “[Know Your Customer] watchlist country.”Related: Democrats seek suspicious activity reports linked to Trump crypto venturesPublic Citizen, in partnership with progressive political organization Our Revolution, will hold a rally near the golf club, which Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley is expected to attend. In addition, the Arlington and Loudoun Democrats will be hosting a separate event to urge US officials to “hold [Trump] accountable,” and Democratic leadership in Congress has scheduled two press events on May 22 ahead of the dinner.“Americans cannot and will not accept President Trump’s view that positions of power exist only to benefit the holder of that power,” Ryan Ruzic, chair of the Loudoun County Democratic Committee, told Cointelegraph. “We have a moral responsibility to speak out against corruption, whatever the result may be.”Pushback on TRUMP memecoin affected crypto legislationSome lawmakers initially cited the memecoin dinner and the Trump family’s involvement with the crypto platform World Liberty Financial in opposing passage of the GENIUS Act, a bill to regulate payment stablecoins. World Liberty Financial began issuing its own USD1 stablecoin in March, prompting concerns about Trump’s conflicts of interest. However, the legislation passed a key procedural vote in the Senate on May 19 with support from Democrats, setting the bill up for debate in the chamber.“Many senators, myself included, have very real concerns about the Trump family’s use of crypto technologies to evade oversight, hide shady financial dealings, and personally profit at the expense of everyday Americans,” said Sen. Mark Warner in a statement before the May 19 vote, adding: “But we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay.”Senator Chris Murphy, who voted against advancing the GENIUS Act, called for bipartisan support in amending the bill to specifically bar a US president from issuing stablecoins. He also called on the White House to release a complete list of attendees to the memecoin dinner, suggesting that some or all of them would “try to get something from the president” in exchange for purchasing the tokens. Murphy and Senator Elizabeth Warren will attend a press event with representatives for Public Citizen on May 22. California Representative Maxine Waters, ranking member of the US House Financial Services Committee, announced a separate press conference for the same day, with plans to introduce a bill to “block Trump’s memecoin and stop his crypto corruption, once and for all.”As of May 21, the exact number of attendees to the dinner was unknown. A smaller group of 25 tokenholders also qualified to apply for “VIP tour” and reception — presumably at the White House — with Trump, but the complete list of those planning to attend was also unknown at the time of publication.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/protest-donald-trump-memecoin-dinner?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

For many, this could be the long-awaited climax of the past four years, and major players are preparing accordingly.Since late 2024, Bitcoin whale accumulation has surged. Glassnode data shows that the number of addresses holding over 100 BTC has jumped by almost 14%, reaching 18,200 — a level not seen since 2017. The biggest market players appear to be positioning for what could be this cycle’s final run-up.Number of BTC addresses holding over 100 BTC. Source: GlassnodeHowever, riding the rally is trickier than it looks and knowing when to exit is notoriously difficult. The lure of higher price highs fuels FOMO, driving investors to buy the top, only to face painful drawdowns or even liquidations.So, how can traders and investors spot the top before the market enters recession?Bitcoin cycle top markersSeveral technical and onchain indicators, such as MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Z-score, Pi Cycle Top, and trading volume trends, have historically been reliable in signaling when Bitcoin is nearing its peak.The MVRV-Z score compares Bitcoin’s market value to its realized value and adjusts for volatility. A high Z-score suggests Bitcoin is significantly overvalued relative to its historical cost basis. When this indicator is at a historical high, the ensuing downward trend in Bitcoin prices is likely.The Pi Cycle Top tracks BTC price dynamics using moving averages. When the 111-day moving average (111-SMA) crosses above twice the 350-day average (350-SMAx2), it signals overheating. In other words, when the short-term trend catches up to the long-term trajectory, a market top is in.Historically, all previous Bitcoin bull runs started with a notable surge in MVRV Z-score, and ended with 111-SMA crossing the longer-term trend.BTC: Pi Cycle Top + MVRV Z-score. Source: Marie Poteriaieva, GlassnodeAdditionally, lower trading volumes during price increases can be a warning sign, often signaling weakening momentum and potential for a reversal. On-balance volume (OBV), which registers cumulative volume flow, is a valuable metric for tracking this process. When OBV diverges from the price action, it is often an early reversal signal. The second leg of the 2021 bull run was a great example. While BTC price was hitting higher highs of $68,000 (compared to the previous all-time high of $63,170), trading volumes moved in a different direction, decreasing from 710,000 BTC to 628,000 BTC. This created a bearish divergence between price and volume, suggesting that fewer market participants were supporting the rally — a classic sign of waning momentum.BTC/USD 1-day, OBV.

Some valuable metrics that can track it are the Puell Multiple and exchange flows.The Puell Multiple Indicator looks at miners' revenue relative to its 365-day average. High readings indicate miners may start selling aggressively, and are often seen near market tops.Large inflows to exchanges are usually signs of distribution, as investors prepare to sell their coins. BTC total transfer volume to exchanges + Puell Multiple.

The curved parabolic trendline that’s supported the rally is broken — a clear signal that the top is likely in. Meanwhile, altcoins and meme tokens may continue pumping a little longer.Complacency. Measure 15% below Bitcoin’s all-time high. That’s the sell zone. Order books on major exchanges often show a wall of sell orders around this level — a likely institutional exit point.According to Garner, the 15% (or 16%) rule works not only in crypto but in traditional markets as well.Historical blow off-tops: BTC, ETH, gold, Nasdaq, Nikkei, Broadvision, 3D Systems.

In a May 21 social media post that begins with, “The Empire Lobbies Back,” Campbell claimed that the banking industry is especially alarmed by the potential for stablecoins to offer interest or rewards to holders. In a pointed message aimed at Democratic lawmakers, Campbell wrote that “banks want you to protect their cartel so they can keep screwing your voters.” He went on to explain how fractional reserve banking enables banks to maximize profits while offering depositors minimal interest.The banking lobby says that if stablecoins pay interest or any other type of monetary reward, banks will be “harmed,” Campbell added.An excerpt of Campbell’s X post.

In line with its current trajectory, 21st Capital co-founder Sina noted that Bitcoin is approaching a pivotal moment around the $108,000 level. The Bitcoin Quantile Model update shows that BTC’s market reflects the same “heat” that was present after President Trump’s post-election rally and the spot ETF-driven highs during Q4 2024. The model, which uses quantile regression to map Bitcoin’s price phases on a logarithmic scale, indicates the cryptocurrency is in the Transition Zone, a critical juncture before the Acceleration Phase. Throughout Q4, 2024, Bitcoin rallied by 45% after entering a price discovery period above $74,500. Bitcoin Quantile Model. Source: X.comAs illustrated in the chart, once it breaks into the \""Acceleration\"" Phase, it could trigger BTC’s next leg or the mid-phase, typically between the 33% and 66% range. Based on the model, BTC is expected to progressively target price levels of $130,000 and $163,000 in the coming months. However, anonymous Bitcoin analyst apsk32 believed a price target above $200,000 is a “reasonable” expectation for 2025. Basing the projection on Bitcoin’s “power curve,” the analyst noted that BTC’s position relative to gold has significantly improved since April. From a technical standpoint, this view is supported by the recent convergence of the Sharpe ratios for Bitcoin and gold, suggesting that the two hard assets now offer comparable risk-to-reward profiles to their investors. Fidelity’s Director of Global Macro Jurrien Timmer shed light on this development, recommending a 4:1 goal-to-Bitcoin ratio from an allocation perspective. Related: Bitcoin 'blow-off top' set at $128K with new all-time highs in sightStrong Bitcoin volumes “final straw” before new highs Crypto researcher Aylo analyzed BTC’s historical price action when the crypto asset consolidates near its all-time high level. In an X post, the analyst explained, “The data shows when BTC gets close to its previous ATH during a strong, accelerating trend with high momentum, it has historically broken out to new ATHs within a short time (days to weeks).”However, weaker trends have led to stalls or retraces between March and May 2024. Currently, Bitcoin exhibits a strong trend but lacks the necessary trading volume, which remains the final straw to confirm a breakout, a factor that could delay upward movement.Alyo added that for Bitcoin to break its all-time highs, daily trading volume should exceed the previous 10 days, be at least 1.5 times the 20-day average, and ideally sustain a 3-day increase while the price holds steady or rises.Data from CryptoQuant has reinforced Aylo’s concerns about trading volume. On May 21, retail investor demand for Bitcoin, defined as wallets buying/selling between $0 and $10,000, remained low at just 3.2% over 30 days, despite BTC trading within $2,000 of its all-time high.Bitcoin’s retail investor volumes.

This indicates fresh capital inflows into the market at higher prices. As Cointelegraph reported, holding above $2,400 was crucial to ensure a potential $3,000 retest.Ethereum: Key pricing levels.

This concentration suggests many investors may sell at break-even, potentially stalling Ether’s upward momentum.Ethereum cost basis distribution chart. Source: GlassnodeFrom a technical perspective, ETH must flip the $3,000 resistance level into support to target higher highs above $4,000.But first, the ETH/USD pair must close above the $2,600-$2,800 range, where the 100-day and 50-day simple moving averages (SMA) currently sit. ETH price dropped below this level in February, driven by risk-off sentiment following Trump’s tariff measures. ETH/USD weekly chart.

Ether ETFs registered $100.7 million in net inflows in the last three days, per Farside Investors’ data.Meanwhile, the bears will attempt to keep the $2,600 resistance in place to increase the likelihood of pulling the price lower. The immediate target is below the $2,400 level, or the 200-day SMA.Below $2,400, the next key area of interest remains between $2,200 and the psychological level at $2,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) set a new high of $109,400 on May 21, rising more than 26% in the past month, according to data from TradingView.

2025-05-21T15:00:00.000Z,"How to handle crypto trading gains and losses on your balance sheet","Key takeawaysProperly accounting for crypto assets on your balance sheet is essential for accurate tax reporting and financial transparency.Crypto trading activities should be recorded like stock trading, at fair market value on the day of purchase.In some countries, like the US, crypto losses can offset gains, so keeping track of gains and losses is important for reducing taxable income.Whether you’re an individual investor or a business, treating cryptocurrencies as assets and documenting them ensures compliance with tax laws and minimizes the risk of errors.Let’s be real, it’s easy to lose sight of what you’ve actually gained or lost, especially when it comes to crypto and its market volatility and frequent trading activities. And when it comes to accounting, especially in countries like the United States, it gets trickier because you must reflect those numbers properly on your balance sheet. If you are running a business that involves crypto or you are just a crypto investor, understanding how to account for your digital assets correctly is crucial. This guide breaks down the basics of balance sheets, handling crypto gains and losses, and what tax implications you need to account for.What is a balance sheet, and why is it needed?Think of a balance sheet as a report of your financial health. It shows what you own, owe and what’s left over at a specific point in time. It contains three main parts: Assets: What the company owns, such as cash, crypto, real estate, inventory, etc.Liabilities: What the company owes, such as loans, unpaid bills and taxesEquity: What’s left after subtracting liabilities from assets (net worth).For example, if you own $50,000 worth of crypto, and at the same time, you owe someone $20,000. In this case, your equity is $30,000. Balance sheets help you understand your financial position at a glance. They’re essential for filing taxes, attracting investors, applying for loans and complying with regulations. Balance sheets are essential in countries like the United States, where businesses must report crypto holdings accurately for tax and compliance reasons. Similarly, in the UK, European countries and Canada, balance sheets are important for businesses and are often used by individuals, especially when dealing with crypto assets. It’s not just for taxes. A well-maintained balance sheet can help you get funding, plan your finances, or simply sleep better knowing where you stand at night.How do you treat crypto on a balance sheet?One of the most common questions when preparing a balance sheet is, “How to report crypto trading gains and losses on a balance sheet?” In most jurisdictions, the crypto reporting and taxation rules are still to be decided or clarified. This also applies to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which lack definitive guidance concerning cryptocurrency accounting.As cryptocurrencies are considered assets in many jurisdictions, the fundamental concepts of accounting for assets could apply when preparing a balance sheet involving crypto transactions. Below is an example of a simplified crypto balance sheet treatment and some helpful pointers that may assist you in accounting for crypto trading in 2025.Notes to the balance sheet:Cash ($15,000): Represents fiat currency (e.g., USD) held in bank accounts or wallets, including proceeds from selling crypto or other revenue.Cryptocurrency ($20,000): Recorded at cost basis (fair market value at acquisition, less any impairment). Includes 0.5 Bitcoin (BTC) purchased at $30,000 each ($15,000 total) and 10 Ether (ETH) purchased at $500 each ($5,000 total). No impairment has been recorded, assuming the fair market value (FMV) remains above cost.Mining equipment ($5,000): Capitalized cost of crypto mining hardware, net of depreciation. The original cost was $8,000, with $3,000 accumulated depreciation over two years.Accounts payable ($2,000): Unpaid bills (e.g., for electricity or supplier services related to crypto mining operations).Taxes payable ($1,500): Estimated tax liability for realized crypto gains (e.g., from selling 0.1 BTC at a $2,000 gain, taxed at 20% long-term capital gains rate for simplicity).Retained earnings ($36,500): Accumulated profits, including crypto-related income (e.g., mining revenue, realized gains) minus expenses and taxes. Reflects net income from prior and current periods.When buying cryptocurrency with fiat moneyWhen you buy cryptocurrency with fiat money, such as dollars or euros, you’re simply exchanging one type of asset, such as cash, for another, like crypto or stocks. On your balance sheet, cryptocurrency trading activities should be recorded similarly to those of stock trading activities. As with stocks, you should record cryptocurrency on your balance sheet at its fair market value on the day of purchase. While your cash account displays a credit for the same amount, the cryptocurrency is recorded as a debit to your assets account.When selling cryptocurrency for fiat moneySelling crypto for fiat creates a change in your balance sheet: Your crypto holdings will be reduced, meaning credited, and your cash will increase, which also means that the account will be credited.If you sell for more than you paid (the original price of a token), you have a gain; if you sell for less, you record a loss. Both crypto gains and crypto losses should be tracked carefully for tax and reporting purposes.How to record crypto lossesThe difference is recorded as a loss when you sell crypto at a lower price than you bought it for. In some countries, these losses can lower your taxable income, so it can prove useful to properly document them.  However, even if the asset regains its previous price levels, impairment losses cannot be undone in accordance with GAAP’s accounting rules for intangible assets.This contrasts with IFRS, where certain intangible assets can be revalued upward under IAS 38 if an active market exists. However, crypto markets are volatile, and IFRS guidance on crypto revaluation remains unclear, so most entities stick to cost-less impairment. Businesses should consult local accounting standards and auditors for precise treatment.How to record crypto profitsIf you receive cryptocurrency as payment for goods, services or other activities, it’s treated as income at the fair market value on the date you receive it. This value is recorded as revenue and added to your assets. Later, if you sell or swap the crypto, any difference in value will result in a capital gain or loss.How to record crypto mining When cryptocurrency mining income occurs, it should be reported at the currency’s fair market value. This revenue should be shown on your income statement since it increases your assets.Similar to other revenue-generating activities, companies engaged in cryptocurrency mining are required to report their crypto profits on their balance sheet. Their mining income account will be credited as a result. Subsequently, the newly generated digital asset has to be recorded in their accounts at its fair market value.Additionally, costs related to mining operations should be recorded. For example, the cash account needs to be credited if cash is spent to cover mining costs. The purchase of mining equipment, which requires capitalization and amortization, will subsequently be deducted from the associated asset account or otherwise documented as a cost for items like utilities and supplies.Using cryptocurrency to pay suppliersPaying suppliers or vendors with cryptocurrency is like selling the asset since you have to recognize any gain or loss in relation to its original value. Therefore, the difference between the asset’s book value and its expense will be recorded as a capital gain.How to record transaction fees and exchange rates It’s critical to keep track of transaction costs and exchange rate fluctuations when trading or exchanging cryptocurrencies. Fees should be shown as an expense on the balance sheet since they lower your net gain or increase your loss. Changes in exchange rates may also have an impact on the value recorded when converting cryptocurrency into fiat, which could have an effect on your taxes and capital gains.Did you know? Cryptocurrency held for more than a year can be categorized as a long-term asset on your balance sheet in some jurisdictions, which may result in better tax treatment than short-term holdings.How are cryptocurrencies taxed?Taxation of cryptocurrencies varies by country, but your balance sheet plays a crucial role in tracking taxable events. Under current GAAP, crypto is recorded at cost and tested for impairment. IFRS allows revaluation in rare cases, but most entities use the cost model. For traders holding crypto as inventory, GAAP (ASC 330) or IFRS (IAS 2) may apply, with FMV adjustments. The lack of definitive guidance means businesses must apply judgment and document assumptions clearly. In the US, crypto is treated as property, with taxes applied to capital gains when selling or trading. The Internal Revenue Service requires reporting on your balance sheet; losses can offset gains. Also, the US introduced Form 1099-DA in 2025 for crypto brokers to report transactions, increasing compliance requirements. In the UK, cryptocurrencies are taxed under capital gains for individuals, while income tax may apply if trading is frequent or when crypto is received as income, such as through mining, staking or as payment for services.Canada follows a similar approach, taxing crypto as capital gains (50% inclusion rate) or business income for active traders. Mining income is taxable as income.In Germany, long-term holders (over a year) pay no tax on capital gains, but short-term trades over 600 euros are taxed. Notably, the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation (effective 2024) standardizes crypto reporting, impacting balance sheet documentation in member states.Accounting for Ethereum transactionsEthereum, the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts, has unique accounting needs. Here’s how to handle common Ethereum transactions on your balance sheet:Staking rewards: Staking ETH on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network generates rewards, treated as income at FMV when received. For example, receiving 0.1 ETH as a staking reward debits your “Cryptocurrency” asset account and credits “Revenue” on your income statement. Selling staked ETH later triggers a capital gain or loss.Gas fees: Ethereum transactions incur gas fees, which are expenses. Record these as a debit to “Transaction Fees” (an expense account) and a credit to “Cash” or “Cryptocurrency” if paid in ETH. For example, a $50 gas fee paid in ETH reduces your ETH holdings and is expensed.DeFi transactions: Yield farming or liquidity provision (e.g., on Uniswap) generates rewards, treated as income at FMV when received. For example, earning 100 UNI (UNI) tokens ($1,000) debits “Cryptocurrency” and credits “Revenue.” Track gas fees and token swaps as expenses or taxable events.ERC-20 tokens: Ethereum-based tokens (e.g., USDC, LINK) are separate assets. Record each at its FMV at acquisition, like ETH, and track them individually to avoid confusion.Accurate tracking of Ethereum transactions ensures compliance, especially with increased IRS scrutiny on staking and DeFi in 2025.Tools and best practices for crypto accountingManaging crypto transactions can be daunting, but these tools and tips simplify the process:Accounting software: Use platforms like CoinTracker, Koinly or CryptoTaxCalculator to track Ethereum transactions, calculate gains/losses, and generate tax reports. These tools integrate with wallets and exchanges, ensuring accurate FMV records.Regular reconciliation: Match your balance sheet’s crypto holdings to wallet/exchange records monthly to catch errors, especially for gas fees or staking rewards.Work with professionals: Crypto tax rules, especially for Ethereum’s DeFi and staking, are complex. Consult a crypto-savvy accountant to ensure compliance with IRS, His Majesty’s Revenue & Customs or other regulations.Document everything: Keep records of every Ethereum transaction, including FMV, gas fees and staking rewards, to prepare for audits or Form 1099-DA reporting in 2025.By staying organized, you’ll minimize errors and stress when filing taxes or preparing financial statements.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-trading-gains-and-losses-on-balance-sheet?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-21T15:00:00.000Z,"Crypto&#039;s real momentum isn&#039;t in the charts; it&#039;s in developer activity","Opinion by: Markus Levin, co-founder of XYOThe crypto community often experiences periods of heightened anxiety. Market downturns are often triggered by counterproductive sentiment-driven events rather than by fundamental issues, creating a significant disconnect between price behavior and the actual progress being made within the industry by the companies within it. What often goes unnoticed is how much real development happens during these downturns. While market movements capture most of the attention, teams are building faster and more deliberately behind the scenes than ever. The focus shifts away from price speculation and toward real execution. Growth happens during downturns. It's a necessary phase for projects that thrive in a volatile industry. They re-focus attention on refining their technology and business, fueling the next wave of progress.As a result, there's a disconnect between online sentiment and conversations between blockchain industry leaders. For builders and project leaders, the atmosphere is of determination, not doom.Regulators are coming on boardOne of the most promising developments is the accelerating momentum of regulation policy. Many European companies are applying for MiCA licenses in preparation for regulatory updates. There's also a significant policy shift under new US leadership as the SEC retreats from several high-profile crypto enforcement actions. The disparity between sentiment and reality serves as a reminder that price is a lagging indicator. Selloffs are triggered by uncertainty around tariff announcements and background activity such as interest rates. Material, long-term statistics speak for the virtually universal optimism among industry leaders as the number of active developers has remained stable, and the number of established developers almost doubled last year. That's an incredible jump in only one year. From hype to substanceMaturation means teams thoughtfully building, governments engaging seriously with legislation, and users demanding better UX and real utility. The industry has a well-established pattern — market corrections wipe away hype and encourage focus. The last bear market gave rise to breakthroughs in DeFi, NFTs, and zero-knowledge tech. This time, it's about real-world infrastructure, regulation-ready platforms, and next-gen scalability.What emerges in these periods tends to be less visible but more durable. Teams that remain active are often those with clear models, sufficient runway, and a willingness to adapt. These are the periods when we learn whether the systems being built can handle real-world demands. One of the most promising frontiers lies at the intersection of AI and blockchain, the most ubiquitous being within Large Language Models. AI is, however, only as good as the data it's trained on.AI systems are evolving rapidly, but their foundations are skewed. They're built primarily on data scraped from the digital-first countries that predominantly lie in the northern hemisphere, which dominates global media production and internet usage. This creates a feedback loop where Western and East Asian perspectives and widely spoken languages such as English and Mandarin are not only amplified but leave little room for necessary data from smaller populations.A report from Web3 Technologies said 60% of tier-one media on the internet is English. Prominent among these media outlets is The New York Times, which has sued OpenAI based on copyright infringement. The publication alleges that their copyright-protected data was used to train OpenAI's LLM model. Recent: The future of finance is built on Bitcoin — Ethereum was just the testnetKnowing the full extent of the global imbalance in the data creating AI outputs is impossible. Allegations like this and the results delivered when using AI tools suggest the pressing need for a solution.It's even worse. When AI systems are trained on narrow, incomplete data sets, the results can exclude billions from the benefits of emerging technologies. As IBM highlights, data bias isn't just a technical issue — it's a human one with real-world consequences in healthcare, finance, agriculture, and beyond.It's become normal to use AI data every day. We receive personalized Google search results, Adobe has built AI into its industry-standard graphic and video software, and we use AI assistants like Gemini, Grok, and ChatGPT to formulate the thoughts with which we represent ourselves. All of these tools are affected by an overwhelming bias toward the center of a bell curve within their data sets, unable to access or address less common use cases.A popular example demonstrates this issue: Until recently, image generators could not create a full wine glass. No matter what prompt you provided, a wine glass full to the edge was beyond the capabilities of all known generative AI software because they had never been provided photos of wine glasses full to the brim. Their data sets had to be updated to correct this comical problem, which revealed a much more serious one.Decentralized data offers a solution. Globally incentivized systems like DePINs enable the participation of populations that would otherwise remain underserved, allowing the valuable data they provide to come online. This improves the service for everyone, making smaller global communities more accessible to commerce and enabling them easier access to the rest of the world. It also empowers smaller data creators to monetize their data rather than relinquishing it to tech giants. Where do we go from here?The crypto industry is entering a new phase. A phase that's more productive and sustainable. Expect to see rapid growth in working infrastructure, platforms and applications that welcome knowledgeable, consumer-friendly regulations and projects that respect the time and money of their users.Opportunities within the crypto space are changing but not shrinking. Our opportunities grow as we learn from what has not worked in the last few years. They will take time to develop, but successful builders will focus on long-term, incremental change and sound business practices rather than chasing fads and short-term profits.The momentum of real progress has never been stronger, and it is precisely during times like these, when it feels like no one's watching, that the foundations of the future are laid.Opinion by: Markus Levin, co-founder of XYO.

2025-05-21T14:00:55.000Z,"AI tool claims 97% efficacy in preventing ‘address poisoning’ attacks","Crypto cybersecurity firm Trugard and onchain trust protocol Webacy have developed an artificial intelligence-based system for detecting crypto wallet address poisoning.According to a May 21 announcement shared with Cointelegraph, the new tool is part of Webacy’s crypto decisioning tools and “leverages a supervised machine learning model trained on live transaction data in conjunction with onchain analytics, feature engineering and behavioral context.” The new tool purportedly has a success score of 97%, tested across known attack cases. “Address poisoning is one of the most underreported yet costly scams in crypto, and it preys on the simplest assumption: That what you see is what you get,” said Webacy co-founder Maika Isogawa.Address poisoning detection infographic. Source: Trugard and WebacyCrypto address poisoning is a scam where attackers send small amounts of cryptocurrency from a wallet address that closely resembles a target’s real address, often with the same starting and ending characters. The goal is to trick the user into accidentally copying and reusing the attacker’s address in future transactions, resulting in lost funds.The technique exploits how users often rely on partial address matching or clipboard history when sending crypto. A January 2025 study found that over 270 million poisoning attempts occurred on BNB Chain and Ethereum between July 1, 2022, and June 30, 2024. Of those, 6,000 attempts were successful, leading to losses over $83 million.Related: What are address poisoning attacks in crypto and how to avoid them?Web2 security in a Web3 worldTrugard chief technology officer Jeremiah O’Connor told Cointelegraph that the team brings deep cybersecurity expertise from the Web2 world, which they’ve been “applying to Web3 data since the early days of crypto.” The team is applying its experience with algorithmic feature engineering from traditional systems to Web3. He added:“Most existing Web3 attack detection systems rely on static rules or basic transaction filtering. These methods often fall behind evolving attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures.“The newly developed system instead leverages machine learning to create a system that learns and adapts to address poisoning attacks. O’Connor highlighted that what sets their system apart is “its emphasis on context and pattern recognition.” Isogawa explained that “AI can detect patterns often beyond the reach of human analysis.”Related: Jameson Lopp sounds alarm on Bitcoin address poisoning attacksThe machine learning approachO’Connor said Trugard generated synthetic training data for the AI to simulate various attack patterns. Then the model was trained through supervised learning, a type of machine learning where a model is trained on labeled data, including input variables and the correct output.In such a setup, the goal is for the model to learn the relationship between inputs and outputs to predict the correct output for new, unseen inputs. Common examples include spam detection, image classification and price prediction.O’Connor said the model is also updated by training it on new data as new strategies emerge. “To top it off, we’ve built a synthetic data generation layer that lets us continuously test the model against simulated poisoning scenarios,” he said. “This has proven incredibly effective in helping the model generalize and stay robust over time.“Magazine: Crypto-Sec: Phishing scammer goes after Hedera users, address poisoner gets $70K",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-system-has-97-claimed-efficacy-in-preventing-address-poisoning-attacks?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-21T13:19:44.000Z,"GENIUS Act legitimizes stablecoins for global institutional adoption","Stablecoin adoption among institutions could surge as the United States Senate prepares to debate a key piece of legislation aimed at regulating the sector.  After failing to gain support from key Democrats on May 8, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act passed the US Senate in a 66–32 procedural vote on May 20 and is now heading to a debate on the Senate floor.The bill seeks to set clear rules for stablecoin collateralization and mandate compliance with Anti-Money Laundering laws.Related: German gov’t missed out on $2.3B profit after selling Bitcoin at $57K“This act doesn’t just regulate stablecoins, it legitimizes them,” said Andrei Grachev, managing partner at DWF Labs and Falcon Finance.“It sets clear rules, and with clarity comes confidence. That’s what institutions have been waiting for,” Grachev told Cointelegraph during the Chain Reaction daily X spaces show on May 20, adding:“Stablecoins aren’t a crypto experiment anymore. They’re a better form of money. Faster, simpler, and more transparent than fiat. It’s only a matter of time before they become the default.”Source: CointelegraphSenate bill seen as path to unified digital systemThe GENIUS Act may be the “first step” toward establishing a “unified digital financial system which is borderless, programmable and efficient,” Grachev said, adding:“When the US moves on stablecoin policy, the world watches.”Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis, a co-sponsor of the bill, also pointed to Memorial Day as a “fair target” for its potential passage.  Grachev said regulatory clarity alone will not drive institutional adoption. Products offering stable and predictable yield will also be necessary.

As of 2023, it had over 150 million Guatemalan quetzals in assets, equivalent to roughly $20 million US. SukuPay said its integration with Zigi marks one of the first crypto-native protocols to be used inside a major Latin American retail bank.Banco Industrial has a long-term issuer default rating of BB.

Monthly remittances typically range from $131 to $648, representing between 6% and 23% of the sender’s average income.“Remittances are lifelines in this region, but they’re broken,” Lapchik told Cointelegraph. “Guatemala alone sees $21 billion in remittances every year, and families are losing 6% to 10% of that to fees and delays. These are people sending $300, $400 a month, and they can’t afford to wait days or pay that much just to get money home,” he said, adding:“Crypto solves this when it’s used the right way. It lets us move money instantly and at a fraction of the cost, integrated into the bank apps people already use.” Latin America is the second-fastest growing region in terms of crypto adoption, though Guatemala lags behind regional leaders Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia, according to a 2024 Chainalysis study.The study cited stablecoins as a primary adoption driver in the region. Crypto adoption in Latin America by total value received.

Pendle now accounts for 30% of all yield-bearing stablecoin total value locked (TVL), roughly $3 billion, the firm said in a report shared with Cointelegraph.  Pendle noted that stablecoins make up 83% of its $4 billion total value locked, a sharp rise from less than 20% just a year ago. In contrast, assets such as Ether (ETH), which historically contributed 80–90% of Pendle’s TVL, have shrunk to less than 10% of its TVL.Traditional stablecoins like USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC) do not pass on interest to holders.

The platform will be powered by Maia, an AI core engine developed by My Aion, and aims to optimize and manage systems across mobility, energy, education, healthcare and digital services. My Aion CEO Daniele Marinelli said the AI will know the user well enough to “recommend the perfect place for your anniversary dinner and book it for you without you lifting a finger.”The project will debut in Abu Dhabi before expanding internationally. It is expected to launch in 18 months. Multibillion-dollar AI project to create jobs for UAE nationalsThe project is structured under a $2.5 billion Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) model, a public-private partnership model for large-scale infrastructure and technology projects. Under the model, private sector entities construct the infrastructure, run and manage the system for a certain period. The companies usually recoup their investments and earn profits during the operational phase. At the end of the period set by the parties involved, ownership and control of the systems developed through the BOT model are transferred to the government or a public sector entity. Bold Technologies CEO Thani Al Thani Al Falasi said the initiative will support UAE job creation. “This initiative will support job creation for UAE nationals, foster local innovation and contribute meaningfully to the national AI ecosystem,” he said. My Aion’s Marinelli said that relocating to Abu Dhabi provides their global operations with a new chapter. “The UAE offers the infrastructure and institutional support needed to scale responsibly and strategically,” Marinelli said.Cointelegraph has reached out to Bold Technologies and My Aion for more information. Related: Decentralized OORT AI data hits top ranks on Google KaggleCrypto proponents say AI could benefit from digital assetsOn May 20, Catena Labs, a project led by Circle co-founder Sean Neville, announced that it will create an AI-native financial institution.

2025-05-21T08:38:10.000Z,"SEC’s Peirce says NFT royalties do not make tokens securities","United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Hester Peirce said many non-fungible tokens (NFTs), including those with mechanisms to pay creator royalties, likely fall outside the purview of federal securities laws.In a recent speech, Peirce said NFTs that allow artists to earn resale revenue do not automatically qualify as securities. Unlike stocks, NFTs are programmable assets that distribute proceeds to developers or artists. The SEC official said that mirrors how streaming platforms compensate musicians and filmmakers. “Just as streaming platforms pay royalties to the creator of a song or video each time a user plays it, an NFT can enable artists to benefit from the appreciation in the value of their work after its initial sale,” Peirce said. Peirce added that the feature does not provide NFT owners any rights or interest in any business enterprise or profits “traditionally associated with securities.”SEC never prohibited NFT royaltiesOscar Franklin Tan, chief legal officer of Enjin core contributor Atlas Development Services, told Cointelegraph that the recent remarks by Peirce on NFTs and creator royalties have been widely misunderstood. Peirce had clarified that NFTs that send resale royalties to artists are not necessarily securities, a view Tan says is legally sound but mischaracterized in some media reports. “So Hester Peirce said that an NFT that sends royalties back to the creator after a sale is not a security. This is correct, but the way some media reported this is completely out of context,” Tan told Cointelegraph. “The actual context is that this is not controversial, and it was never considered a security.”The lawyer said US securities law focuses on regulating investments and not compensating creators for their work. “The artist or creator is not an investor, not a passive third party in the NFT,” he said, noting that royalty payments are not considered investment income. Instead, Tan told Cointelegraph that this type of earning is “analogous to business income,” which the SEC does not regulate. He added: “The SEC never prohibited contracts where artists and creators get royalties from secondary sales of their work, not royalties from paper contracts or blockchain protocols.”Tan explained that the legal distinction becomes more complicated when NFTs promise shared profits from royalties to multiple holders beyond the original creator. Tan also urged regulators and market participants to apply traditional legal reasoning to new blockchain technologies. “Ask yourself, if this were done by pen and paper instead of blockchain, would there still be a regulatory issue?” he said. “If none, slow down.”Source: Oscar Franklin TanRelated: SEC charges Unicoin crypto platform over alleged $100 million fraudOpenSea calls on the SEC to exempt NFT marketplaces from oversightWhile NFT royalties may not have been a controversial SEC issue, NFT marketplaces are a different case. In August 2024, NFT trading platform OpenSea received a Wells notice from the SEC, alleging that NFTs traded on the marketplace could qualify as unregistered securities. On Feb. 22, OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer announced that the SEC has officially closed its investigation into the platform. The executive said that this was a win for the industry. Following the conclusion of the SEC’s investigation, OpenSea’s lawyers penned a letter to Peirce, who leads the SEC’s Crypto Task Force. OpenSea general counsel Adele Faure and deputy general counsel Laura Brookover said in an April 9 letter that NFT marketplaces don’t qualify as brokers under US securities laws. The lawyers said the marketplaces don’t execute transactions or act as intermediaries.

They will also need to establish internal Donation Review Committees to assess the appropriateness of each donation and the liquidation strategy.To reduce risks of money laundering, all donations must be routed through verified Korean won exchange accounts, with verification responsibilities placed on banks, exchanges and the nonprofits themselves.Furthermore, only cryptocurrencies listed on at least three major domestic exchanges will be eligible, and liquidation is expected to occur immediately upon receipt.Guidelines regarding nonprofits selling crypto donations.

Sales will be capped at daily limits, typically no more than 10% of the total planned amount.Furthermore, sales will only be permitted for the top 20 tokens by market cap across five won-based exchanges. Importantly, exchanges are barred from selling tokens on their own platforms to prevent conflicts of interest.South Korea is also tightening standards for listing digital assets. The revised rules aim to curb instability from sudden price spikes by requiring a minimum circulating supply before a token is allowed to trade and temporarily restricting market orders post-listing.So-called zombie tokens (with low volume and thin market caps) and memecoins without clear utility will face more scrutiny. For instance, exchanges must delist tokens if they fail to meet liquidity benchmarks or community engagement thresholds.Starting in June, exchanges and nonprofits can apply for real-name accounts to facilitate these sales. Later this year, the FSC plans to extend real-name accounts to listed firms and professional investors.Cointelegraph contacted South Korea’s Digital Asset eXchange Association for comment, but had not received a response by publication.Related: RedotPay enters South Korea with crypto-powered payment cardsSouth Korean candidates push pro-crypto agendaSouth Korea’s Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung has proposed launching a stablecoin pegged to the Korean won, aiming to curb capital flight and bolster the country’s financial autonomy.Speaking at a recent policy forum, Lee said a won-based stablecoin could help retain domestic wealth and reduce dependence on foreign-backed digital currencies such as USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC).The initiative is part of Lee’s broader push for digital asset reforms, which also includes legalizing spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs).His rival, Kim Moon-soo of the ruling People Power Party, has also expressed support for introducing spot crypto ETFs, signaling bipartisan momentum on the issue.Magazine: NBA star Tristan Thompson misses $32B in Bitcoin by taking $82M contract in cash",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/south-korea-tightens-kyc-rules-ahead-of-institutional-crypto-entry?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-21T07:35:00.000Z,"Why crypto transfers can fail and what you must check before sending","Why crypto transfers can fail and what you must check before sending              Crypto transfers fail more often than most people realize, but user attentiveness can stop most losses.What’s often marketed as a seamless, borderless system can become frustrating when transfers fail, with no customer service hotline to call and no easy recourse to reverse mistakes. In the crypto universe, the burden of getting it right falls squarely on the shoulders of the user.But here’s the encouraging part: Most failures are preventable. Understanding why crypto transfers fail can help users avoid costly missteps, navigate the quirks of different networks and send funds with far greater confidence. With a little preparation, you can sidestep common pitfalls and take control of your crypto experience.Did you know? According to a recent survey, 37% of people cite security risks as the most significant barrier to adopting crypto for payments, a reminder of how crucial it is to prioritize security at every step.                   Common crypto transfer mistakes              A single slip — wrong address, wrong network or underpaid fee — tops the list of costly crypto-transfer mistakes.Here’s a quick look at common crypto transfer mistakes:Sending crypto to the wrong address: Blockchain transactions are irreversible. A single wrong character in the recipient’s wallet address can send funds into the void, or worse, into a stranger’s wallet.Choosing the wrong network: Sending Tether USDt (USDT) over Ethereum instead of Tron? That’s a classic mistake. Always match the network to your recipient’s supported network.Underpaying gas or fees: Lowballing crypto gas fees, also known as blockchain transaction fees, can leave your transaction stuck or pending indefinitely.Not double-checking wallet compatibility: Some wallets can’t handle certain tokens or blockchains. Always verify.Sending tokens on the wrong network — like Ethereum instead of BNB Chain — can result in permanent loss. One user learned this the hard way (as shown in the image above) after transferring crypto to Coinbase from Binance using an unsupported network.                  Failed crypto transaction explained              Even perfect-looking transactions can crumble if gas is too low, a smart contract glitches or network congestion spikes.A failed crypto transaction can happen even if all the input details seem right. One major reason is insufficient gas fees. If the gas you set is too low, blockchain validators may ignore your transaction entirely. In some cases, this causes the transaction to fail outright; in others, it remains stuck in a pending state for hours or even days.Smart contract hiccups are another hidden landmine, especially in the decentralized finance (DeFi) world. If the contract’s code has flaws or can’t handle your input, your transaction can bounce back. Add in network congestion — especially on high-traffic chains like Ethereum, where every block is a battle for space — and even well-planned transfers can stall or fail without warning.Did You Know? A study analyzing over 1.5 billion failed transactions on the Solana blockchain found that bot spamming and network congestion were significant contributors to transaction failures.                  Crypto transfer troubleshooting guide              A quick five-point checklist (address, network, explorer status, wallet queue, asset support) usually reveals why funds haven’t landed.If your crypto transfer isn’t received, don’t panic. Check these first:Confirm the recipient’s address is correct.Verify the transfer network (was it Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon, etc.).Check the status on a block explorer (like Etherscan for Ethereum or Solscan for Solana).Review your wallet and see if the transfer is still pending.Make sure the recipient wallet supports the asset you sent.If you catch an issue early, some platforms allow you to speed up or cancel a stuck transaction by paying a higher gas fee.What to check before sending cryptoPrevention is your best friend.Before sending any crypto, take a few moments to verify all the critical details. Always double-check the recipient’s wallet address. The safest method is copy-paste; never type it out manually. Ensure that the address belongs to the correct network and is compatible with the token you’re sending.Make sure the address matches the right network and can handle the token you’re sending. And don’t forget the fees. On Ethereum, for example, you’ll need some ETH in your wallet to cover gas or that transfer’s going nowhere. Also, confirm the receiving wallet can accept the token and that you're not hitting any daily or regional transfer limits imposed by the platform.Did You Know? A single copy-paste mistake cost one crypto trader $26 million in Renzo Restaked ETH (ezETH). The tokens were sent to the wrong wallet address, and recovery was impossible, even with white hat hackers trying to help.                  Crypto transfer speed and networks              Different blockchains clear at various speeds, so match your urgency to a network’s typical confirmation time.Chains like Solana, Avalanche and Tron blaze through transactions in seconds, leaving older titans like Bitcoin and Ethereum catching their breath, especially when network traffic spikes and block space gets tight. And they’re not alone. Newer players like Aptos and Sui are also pushing the limits of scale and throughput, signaling a fierce race for speed across the crypto ecosystem.That’s why knowing the average speed of the network you’re using matters. Sending Bitcoin (BTC)? Expect to wait around 10 minutes per confirmation, there are 6 of them. Moving USDT on Solana? It should arrive almost instantly. Being aware of these differences helps set realistic expectations and avoid unnecessary panic when a transfer lags. And when every second counts — whether you’re racing to secure a trade or make a payment — choosing a fast crypto network can save you time and stress.                  How the crypto Travel Rule can cause transfer failures              Regulatory hurdles like the Travel Rule can freeze transfers if sender or recipient data doesn’t line up across jurisdictions.The crypto Travel Rule requires virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to share key details about the sender and recipient when handling transfers above set limits. If that information is missing, incomplete, or doesn’t match up, your transaction can hit a wall, often getting delayed or blocked entirely. This issue pops up frequently in cross-border transfers or when moving funds to exchanges.Other problems arise from the “sunrise issue,” where some countries have adopted the Travel Rule and others haven’t. This mismatch can lead to compliance conflicts and blocked transactions. Self-hosted wallets also present a challenge: Some VASPs won’t process transfers to wallets they can’t verify. As regulations tighten, expect more of these friction points in crypto transfers.Did you know? A report by Cointelegraph Research and Onramper found that 50% of fiat-to-crypto transactions fail, even when users have completed Know Your Customer (KYC) checks. User location, banking restrictions and local regulations all play a role in whether those transactions succeed or collapse.                   How to avoid failed crypto transactions              Send a test amount, watch live gas trackers and never rush. Slow, informed moves keep transactions from failing.Avoiding failed transactions comes down to awareness and caution. First, always test with a small amount before transferring large sums. This gives you a chance to catch mistakes without losing much. Second, always monitor current gas fees, especially on volatile networks like Ethereum. Tools like Etherscan Gas Tracker and Blocknative Gas Estimator give live Ethereum gas prices. Many wallets (like MetaMask) also show gas estimates in the app. Using a reputable crypto wallet that offers real-time fee suggestions and transaction previews helps immensely. Finally, take your time. Many failed transactions happen simply because users are in a rush or feeling pressured to act fast. In crypto, speed can kill your funds.Did you know? One user paid $200 in gas fees on Ethereum for a failed transaction that returned nothing. The cause? Slippage settings were off, and the network still charged full fees.                  How to verify a crypto transfer              Plug the transaction hash into a block explorer for an instant verdict on whether your transfer is pending, confirmed or failed.Once you send crypto, the transaction hash becomes your receipt. Paste it into a block explorer of the chain you used, like Etherscan, Solscan or Tronscan, to get live updates. This will tell you if the transaction is pending, confirmed or failed, along with timestamps, block numbers and fee details.Some wallets and exchanges now offer built-in tracking tools that integrate directly with explorers. These make it easier for beginners to stay informed without needing to navigate third-party websites. If a transfer seems stuck, checking the status this way should always be your first move.                  Mastering crypto transfers: Confidence over chaos              Triple-checking details, monitoring fees and staying curious turns crypto transfers from a gamble into a confident routine. One wrong digit, one wrong network, and your funds could vanish into the void. This isn’t just about saving your wallet; it’s about owning your peace of mind.As blockchains scale and regulations tighten, the winners are those who move smart, not just fast. So here’s the vibe: Slow down to level up. Triple-check that address. Know the platform you’re using. Watch those fees. Stay cool when networks get jammed.The pros don’t rush; they prepare. Back up your keys. Keep your tools sharp. Stay curious and keep learning, because the crypto game rewards those who respect it.Master the flow, and you trade chaos for confidence. That’s when crypto becomes your playground.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/why-crypto-transfers-can-fail-and-what-you-must-check-before-sending?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

He said that the experience and positioning of dedicated crypto VCs “has compounded over time,” creating barriers for less focused investors trying to enter the space.Founded in 2001, Theta shifted its focus to digital assets in 2018 and now manages about $1.2 billion. The firm has backed leading crypto investment names such as Polychain Capital, CoinFund and Castle Island Ventures.Source: Theta CapitalRelated: AI takes nearly 60% of global venture capital dollars in Q1Crypto VC deals reboundThe fund’s close comes as crypto venture capital begins to rebound. According to Galaxy Digital, VC investment in digital assets rose 54% in the first quarter of 2025 to $4.8 billion, signaling renewed confidence in the sector after a prolonged downturn.A report from PitchBook also showed that crypto venture capital funding surged in early 2025, even as deal activity declined.The report showed that 405 VC deals were completed in Q1 2025, a 39.5% drop from the 670 recorded in the same period last year. However, that’s a modest uptick from the 372 deals seen in Q4 2024.Despite fewer deals, total funding more than doubled year-over-year, reaching $6 billion in Q1 compared to $2.6 billion in Q1 2024, also doubling from the previous quarter’s $3 billion.PitchBook’s senior crypto analyst Robert Le noted that even amid macroeconomic uncertainty, “capital continued to seek crypto’s core utility rails.”The bulk of the investment — around $2.55 billion across just 16 deals — went to companies in asset management, trading platforms and crypto financial services. Infrastructure and development firms followed, raising nearly $955 million across 30 deals.Web3-focused companies saw the third-most deals and funding, at 23 and $231.2 million, respectively.
