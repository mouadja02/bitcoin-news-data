2025-05-22T14:55:57.000Z,"Expert Explains Why XRP Will Go Much Higher","As Bitcoin rockets to a new all-time high , the broader crypto market’s sentiment is turning bullish again, yet XRP remains relatively subdued at $2.40. However, according to prominent market analyst CryptoBull, this period of calm around XRP could be the precursor to an explosive rally. Drawing on his experience from the 2017 and 2018 bull markets, CryptoBull suggests that the lack of euphoria among XRP holders today is a bullish signal, hinting at massive upside potential. With Bitcoin new ATH and #XRP sitting at $2.40 it’s dead here. I was here in 2017/2018 and the euphoria was insane. That means XRP will go so much higher. — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) May 21, 2025 CryptoBull, a well-followed figure on X, made his case in a recent post, pointing out the contrast between the current quiet surrounding XRP and the frenzied excitement that engulfed the coin during previous cycles. “With Bitcoin at a new ATH and #XRP sitting at $2.40, it’s dead here. I was here in 2017/2018 and the euphoria was insane,” he wrote. “That means XRP will go so much higher.” His statement reflects a seasoned understanding of market psychology, where investor sentiment often lags behind price action, and major moves tend to follow periods of disbelief. The Historical Parallel: 2017/2018 vs. 2025 In late 2017, XRP skyrocketed from under $0.30 to $3.84 in weeks, fueled by retail investor frenzy and speculation. However, that rally occurred in a market that was still nascent, largely unregulated, and driven by emotion rather than fundamentals. In contrast, today’s market environment is significantly more mature. There’s significant institutional involvement, and regulatory clarity, especially surrounding XRP, has improved, and the infrastructure supporting XRP’s use cases is considerably more robust. Despite these advancements, XRP’s price has not reflected the broader market’s bullish momentum, particularly when compared to assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. CryptoBull believes this lag is not a sign of weakness but strategic accumulation. In past cycles, XRP has historically moved later than its peers, often in a parabolic fashion, once the broader market’s rally nears maturity. Ripple’s Regulatory Wins and Utility Narrative One of the most compelling factors supporting XRP’s potential for a massive upward move is Ripple’s evolving legal position. In 2023, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP is not a security when sold on secondary markets—a landmark decision that provided long-awaited clarity. This partial legal victory allowed XRP to be relisted on major U.S. exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken, paving the way for increased liquidity and investor participation. Moreover, Ripple actively promotes XRP as a linchpin in cross-border payments and liquidity provisioning through its RippleNet and On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) services. With over 70% of Ripple’s ODL volume now transacted outside the U.S., XRP’s real-world utility is becoming a foundational piece of global financial plumbing. This adoption suggests that XRP’s value is not just speculative, but increasingly tied to growing use cases. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Technical Momentum and Market Timing From a technical perspective, XRP hovering at $2.40 while Bitcoin breaks all-time highs is highly reminiscent of pre-breakout consolidation phases seen in earlier bull cycles. Historically, XRP has often staged some of its most dramatic rallies after Bitcoin’s momentum began to cool. This delayed impact has recurred across several cycles, partly due to capital shifting between sectors, where gains from Bitcoin and Ethereum are funneled into altcoins with strong narratives and lagging charts. CryptoBull’s analysis resonates with this view, suggesting that the current “dead” sentiment is a textbook example of a setup for exponential gains. When retail excitement finally returns, it could fuel a price discovery phase that rapidly propels XRP into uncharted territory. A Market Poised for Ascent While many investors may be disillusioned by XRP’s relatively quiet performance amid a roaring bull market, seasoned analysts like CryptoBull see a different picture. The absence of euphoria, historical precedent, legal clarity, and growing utility presents a compelling argument that XRP is simply biding its time. Based on past trends, XRP’s current stability at $2.40 could precede a significant price surge, capturing market attention and vindicating long-term holders. As the market evolves and capital flows into undervalued assets with solid fundamentals, XRP appears well-positioned for a major breakout.

2025-05-22T14:46:40.000Z,"AI for crypto prediction: Myth or Reality?","Trading in the financial markets has evolved and come a long way. And now with AI into the picture, quicker judgments, smarter trading actions, and a better handle on market turbulence, are being promised by many providers offering AI for crypto predictions. Table of Contents Can AI predict crypto prices? How do AI crypto prediction tools work? Best AI tools for crypto predictions It sounds like the future. Algorithms monitor emotion, examine charts, and respond instantly. It is claimed that machine learning can identify trends before they become popular. Crypto, however, is not a script. No matter how sophisticated the model is, it cannot predict everything, particularly when human complexity is involved. In an effort to address the crucial question of whether AI can accurately forecast market movements ahead of time, this article discusses into the core question of whether one can use AI for crypto forecasts, and also use AI for crypto market trends in advance. Let’s dive right into it. Can AI predict crypto prices? Algorithms and machine learning can be used by AI to automate cryptocurrency trading buy and sell decisions. Without human assistance, these computers are able to apply predictive models, examine historical data, and track current market patterns. The objective is to conduct trades using statistical probabilities and eliminate human emotion. How do AI crypto prediction tools work? Large datasets from a variety of sources, including sentiment analysis, social media, blockchain activity, and historical price charts, can be analyzed by AI algorithms. These models learn to identify trends and modify their tactics to forecast future price movements through supervised or reinforcement learning. Here’s how they work: Before searching online, AI models are frequently tested on historical data to see how well they perform in various scenarios. AI systems can manage strategy and execute trades without human input, responding to changes in a matter of seconds. To decipher headlines or tweets that could influence market activity, some people employ natural language processing, or NLP. Handles risk quickly: AI is faster and more accurate than humans at estimating possible losses and evaluating volatility. Depending on the objectives and architecture of the model, it supports a variety of tactics, including mean reversion, momentum trading, arbitrage, and high-frequency trading. You might also like: Google AI Lead: “Don’t take trading advice from ChatGPT” | Interview Best AI tools for crypto predictions While there’s no ‘best’ AI to predict cryptocurrency movements in advance, there are some tools that hit the mark more often than miss. We will discuss the most popular ones among the common crypto investors and specifically free AI for crypto predictions. ChatGPT OpenAI’s ChatGPT AI model is utilized for market analysis, sentiment monitoring, and research in cryptocurrency trading. It is used by traders to create trading strategies, forecast trends, assess news, and automate technical analysis bots. ChatGPT and other AI algorithms are able to identify data trends that frequently result in price adjustments. Crypto is still uncertain, though, because it depends on a lot of human elements. ChatGPT crypto predictions can be right and wrong at the same time as crypto trading is subjective, and the AI algorithm might not be able to predict global events that can significantly affect the price of cryptocurrencies. DeepSeek Originating in China, DeepSeek is a rising star in the field of AI research and language models, gaining popularity due to its sophisticated reasoning capabilities. Traders are beginning to utilize DeepSeek for a variety of purposes, from technical chart analysis to pattern detection in historical price data, even though it was not created specifically for bitcoin prediction. The power of DeepSeek resides in its capacity to combine enormous amounts of intricate data. In the context of the cryptocurrency market, it can help with: Finding nuances in the relationships between crypto fluctuations and macroeconomic data. Producing comprehensive sentiment analysis from news stories, financial reports, and social media sites. Enabling trading strategy backtesting with past market data. DeepSeek can recognize possibilities but not certainties, hence it lacks future vision like any other AI model. Additionally, the quality of the data it receives and the specificity of the prompts it uses have a significant impact on how effective it is. Grok 3 Grok 3 , created by Elon Musk’s AI business xAI, interfaces with the X platform (previously Twitter) and is notable for its real-time social sentiment access, which is a key factor in the movement of cryptocurrency prices. Due to its personality-driven design and superior conversational comprehension, Grok 3 is useful for: Tracking changes in sentiment in real time from X developers, traders, and influencers. Interpreting abrupt narrative shifts, like token listings, project updates, or regulatory news. Helping traders improve their strategies in light of viral debates or current events. It has an edge in identifying early social cues because of its intrinsic integration with X. For instance, a new Layer 2 solution that is trending may attract more attention and pricing activity; Grok is able to identify this more quickly than traditional techniques. That being said, not all traders, particularly those who favor dashboards with a lot of data, will find Grok’s conversational interface and casual tone perfect. It performs best when used as a sentiment companion to more reliable trading strategies or in conjunction with technical instruments. You might also like: What politeness teaches ChatGPT — and why OpenAI’s artificial intelligence is paying millions to listen Can ChatGPT predict crypto prices? ChatGPT can help traders make quicker and better-informed decisions by analyzing cryptocurrency news headlines and producing actionable trade signals. Well-written directions are crucial since ChatGPT will respond more accurately and helpfully if you provide more detailed instructions. However, it must be noted that the predictions provided by ChatGPT can be completely wrong as well and the AI tool is bound to make mistakes as well. How to use ChatGPT to predict crypto market trends? You can use the following prompts in ChatGPT and ask it to predict crypto market trends: Prompt 1: Bitcoin has reached its all-time high. Is there a chance it can retrace 10% or more? Prompt 2: Ethereum’s price has stayed stagnant for a long time. When will it break out of its accumulation phase? Now the answers of ChatGPT will base on the information that is present online at the time you ask the question. However, if in the very next minute something new emerges the prediction can be totally wrong as well. Hence it is advisable to only use ChatGPT as a confluence and not rely on it completely. Is ChatGPT good for predicting crypto? The answer to this is yes and no. Flawed training data, short market history, volatility and black swan events, lack of human instinct, are just some of the reasons that ChatGPT might not be able to predict the markets correctly every time. However, this doesn’t mean you can’t train the AI model into thinking like a human and bring it closer to human instinct, but this requires expertise of AI developers. Can AI predict Bitcoin price? It depends on what you ask about the AI tool you’re using and how efficient that tool is. For example, you ask ChatGPT about Bitcoin ( BTC ) price prediction without going into specifics and it will give you a general overview. However, if you ask about BTC’s price based on moving averages, or RSI, or volume, the answer will be different. So it depends on your trading capability and learning of the market, and only then ChatGPT can help you enhance your target for BTC or any other crypto asset for that matter.

Here Are the Details","MARA Holdings (formerly Marathon Digital), the largest publicly traded crypto mining company in the United States, has taken another strategic step to evaluate institutional Bitcoin assets. MARA Holdings Expands Partnership with Two Prime to Increase Yields on Bitcoin Assets The company announced that it will expand its existing partnership with SEC-registered investment advisor Two Prime, allocating an initial 500 BTC to Two Prime-managed yield strategies. Two Prime was already providing Bitcoin-backed loans to MARA. The new move aims to transform this collaboration into a more comprehensive capital management model. “MARA holds one of the largest institutional Bitcoin treasuries in the world. It sets the standard for how institutional investors can responsibly unlock the value of Bitcoin,” said Alexander Blume, CEO of Two Prime. “This partnership is not only about returns; we are also building a model based on transparency, risk awareness and capital efficiency.” MARA Holdings is the second-largest Bitcoin holder among public companies after Strategy, with 48,137 BTC. The company's market value is around $5.7 billion. MARA, which generated $214 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2024, still reported a net loss of $533 million. In March, the company announced plans to sell up to $2 billion in shares in order to increase its Bitcoin reserves. “More actively investing our Bitcoin assets is a smart and balanced strategy for our shareholders,” said Paul Giordano, Vice President of Digital Asset Management at MARA. “With this allocation to Two Prime’s strategies, we continue to prioritize flexibility and security while increasing our return targets.” Two Prime operates with access to $2.5 billion in capital by developing proprietary Bitcoin derivative strategies for institutional investors. On the other hand, MARA shares have lost about 8% of their value since the beginning of the year, while the bitcoin price has increased by 11.5%, reaching a new all-time high of over $110,000 recently. *This is not investment advice.

Table of Contents What is Keeta? Keeta price prediction Keeta coin price prediction: short-term outlook Keeta price prediction 2025 Keeta price prediction 2030 Since its launch, Keeta ( KTA ) has seen an all-time high of $0.8694, just one day ago, followed by a 15.9% drop in price.

Keeta is an effective and scalable technology that acts as a bridge across several payment networks , enabling direct communication between various blockchains.

Keeta is positioned to transform the blockchain environment by providing previously unheard-of performance and utility, with a $10 million transaction per second performance capacity and settlement times as short as 400 milliseconds. Now let’s discuss KTA price prediction for this year and in the coming years as well. Keeta price prediction What can be a realistic projection for the KTA token? Let’s dive into the KTA price prediction for 2025 and 2030. Keeta coin price prediction: short-term outlook According to CoinCodex’s Keeta price prediction for the near future, the token is projected to rise by 206.74% and reach $2.21 by June 20, 2025. As of Apr. 22nd, 2025, the overall sentiment of the KTA price outlook has turned slightly bullish, with 11 technical analysis indicators showing bullish signals, 2 indicating bearish trends, and 8 indicators showing neutral forecasts. Keeta price prediction 2025 For the remaining months of 2025, DigitalCoinPrice predicts that the KTA token’s price could fluctuate between $0.65 and $1.60, and may likely hold a yearly average of $1.54 . CoinCodex projects that the KTA token can trade in the price channel of $0.720027 and $3.15 in 2025. While the general sentiment in the financial markets is that 2025 will be the year of the bull, it is important to understand that this prediction also has a chance of being wrong. BTC has already breached the $100k mark many times in a row, and there is a possibility that the top of this bull cycle is near. Hence, it is advised to do your research before investing in KTA or any other cryptocurrency with the hopes of gaining on your investment in 2025. Keeta price prediction 2030 As per CoinCodex’s Keeta crypto price prediction for 2030, KTA’s price could vary between $1.945236 and $2.97. DigitalCoinPrice expects that KTA’s price could climb to $3.46 or $3.92 by the end of 2030. Before trusting any source that is trying to predict the KTA price prediction for 2030, you should understand that it is a cryptocurrency and, like all other tokens, the KTA token’s price can be highly volatile. 2030 is five years away, and many cryptocurrencies can become obsolete in that time. This is why it is hard to give a realistic price prediction for any token, including KTA. A great way for KTA to survive these five years and continue its ascent in the crypto market is to continue building its blockchain technology and partner with key players in the digital crypto space. You should research and keep yourself updated with the latest developments in the upcoming years to make an informed investment decision in the KTA token. You might also like: Flare price prediction: Will 2025 be the year FLR breaks out? Is Keeta a good investment? Before investing in any cryptocurrency, including KTA, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that the sentiment in the cryptocurrency market changes quickly, and a token that was once considered the future may also be delisted from major exchanges. Hence, it is advisable to do your research on the token’s fundamentals before having any price expectations for the future of the KTA token. Will Keeta go up or down? Cryptocurrencies in general experience rapid price swings that are directly driven by market sentiments, community engagement, events like token burns, and so on. While it is hard to determine how high the KTA token will go, it is important to look out for potential buying factors that may include new partnerships, increased token holders, or viral campaigns in general. It is also vital that you rely on financial experts and consult them for Keeta price prediction, but even after all that, you should remain cautious, as no one can accurately predict how high or low KTA can go. Should I invest in Keeta? Before investing in any cryptocurrency or trusting any Keeta price forecast, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that cryptocurrencies in general are a highly speculative investment, and their success not only relies on market volatility but also on the constant and sustainable growth of their community. Hence, it is advisable to do your research on the token’s fundamentals, which may very well decide the future of the KTA token. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

This bullish forecast has put Hyperliquid, a high-performance Layer-1 blockchain, firmly in the spotlight. And with growing trading volume and real organic traction, it’s easy to see why. Why Hayes is Backing HYPE’s Rise Hayes’ confidence is rooted in Hyperliquid’s powerful tech. The platform uses a custom-built HyperBFT consensus mechanism and can process up to 100,000 transactions per second. That level of speed and efficiency positions Hyperliquid as a serious player in the DeFi space, with the potential to challenge more established blockchains. From $13 to $30: HYPE’s Rapid Climb Hayes’ $100 call on HYPE comes alongside real momentum in the market. Trader James Wynn recently placed a massive $1.1 billion long Bitcoin position on Hyperliquid, using 40x leverage. His entry price was $108,084.30, and the trade is already showing $17.5 million in unrealized profit. Wynn’s move highlights the growing trust in Hyperliquid’s trading infrastructure and shows that high-profile investors are betting big on its future. This is the best advertising for $HYPE . Let's take this mother fucker to $100.

At the time of writing, HYPE is trading at $30.77, up 16% in the past 24 hours. Its all-time high stands at $34.96, and the current market cap is now over $10.25 billion. James Wynn’s Billion-Dollar Bet Grabs Attention Supporting the move, top trader @JamesWynnReal has amplified Hyperliquid’s allure with a jaw-dropping 40x leveraged long Bitcoin position, surpassing 10,000 BTC, worth $1.1 billion. He bought in at $108,084.30, with a liquidation price set at $103,640. So far, the position has earned him $17.5 million in unrealized gains, showing just how much confidence high-level traders have in Hyperliquid. A $1.5M Profit and a Major Boost for HYPE Wynn has already secured a $1.5 million profit from a partial close on his trade. He’s still holding 9,659 BTC, worth about $1.07 billion. This activity has helped push HYPE from $13 to $30.65, lifting its market cap to $10.24 billion. Over the last 90 days, HYPE has gained more than 291 percent – far outpacing the overall crypto market’s 25.6 percent rise in the same period. Despite a recent 8.5 percent dip caused by whale movement, the token now ranks #16 in the global crypto market. Will HYPE Join the Next Crypto Bull Run? Arthur Hayes is well known for his bold crypto predictions, and his call for HYPE to reach $100 is getting serious attention. Add to that Lucciano’s analysis and Wynn’s massive trades, and it’s clear that momentum is building. With Bitcoin and Ethereum already showing strength, the question now is: will HYPE join them in leading the next major DeFi rally?

In a new Bloomberg interview, Dalio says the Fed “should not cut interest rates” despite the pressure to do so. Dalio says that over the longer term, when the current Fed Governor Jay Powell’s term ends in May of 2026, the Fed could, however, end up cutting rates due to political pressure. “There’s a great deal of uncertainty and there’s a deterioration in sentiment, but really the actual economy. So they (the Fed) are in a difficult position. I think that when we look farther out, we’re dealing with the political aspects… I think that when there’s a new Fed chair, there will likely be more inclination to cut rates because it’s an old story of conflict between those in power, in political [power], who like stimulation. And because of the enormous impact of interest rates on debt service, because the debts are so large, there’s going to be pressure that way.” According to Dalio, the aggressive easing of US monetary policy could negatively impact the bond market. “I think the markets, if they were to see a too aggressive cut in monetary policy, too inappropriate cut, that it would actually be bad for the bond market…. … watch the yield curve. As you get rates rising by long rates and you have also at the same time, let’s say, movement down in the dollar and rises in gold, that kind of dynamic is reflecting a movement out of the bonds.

The move aims to supplement MSTR and STRK sales, which have funded the last few rounds of treasury expansion. Strategy (MSTR) announced the intention to sell $2.1B in preferred STRF stock offering 10% returns. It released a new prospectus for the offer terms and potential sales of STRF shares, offering passive income. Unlike STRK, STRF is not convertible into common stock. Stock sales will be hosted by agents Strategy picked TD Securities (USA) LLC, Barclays Capital Inc., and The Benchmark Company, LLC as sales agents. The firm negotiated an ad hoc sales plan, with none of the agents obliged to sell a certain amount of STRF. The share offerings may happen for a limited period of time, or intermittently, in continuous offers or in blocks. STRF traded at a one-month peak, following the recent BTC rally. | Source: Google Finance The STRF shares were brought to NASDAQ at the end of March and are currently trading at $100.65. The shares bring a 10% annual dividend, paid out quarterly in cash. Strategy has also raised funds with an 8% passive income program linked to STRK convertible shares. Strategy announced it intends to use the proceeds from the STRF sales for corporate purposes, allocating some of the funds to operating expenses and to the purchase of more BTC. The new offer is a relatively small addition to Strategy’s potential stock sales. The company has authorized up to $39B in MSTR and STRK shares, which will be deployed in the long term. STRF sales are also expected to happen over an extended period, offering the company leeway to negotiate market conditions. Strategy will also retain its right to rebuy STRF shares or defer dividends during bad market conditions. STRF sale raises questions on Strategy reliability The recent BTC market rally was beneficial for Strategy, leading to successful MSTR and STRK sales. All the ATM program assets have different risk ratios and may vary in their primacy for compensation in the case of unfavorable market events. STRF seeks to tap demand for predictable passive income with added BTC exposure. However, the prospectus suggests STRF is still linked to overall market performance. Strategy has outlined its practice of funding its passive income offerings with additional stock sales. “We expect to fund any dividends paid in cash on the perpetual strife preferred stock primarily through additional capital raising activities, including, but not limited to, at-the-market offerings of our class A common stock and our preferred stock ,” announced Strategy in its prospectus for the US SEC. The company warned it may choose not to pay out dividends or be unable to secure the required cash. Strategy has already warned in its prospectus that its debt load may lead to unfavorable financing conditions and an inability to fund new BTC purchases. Despite this, demand for Strategy assets remains relatively high. Following the latest BTC all-time high above $111,000, MSTR shares traded at $402.69, still close to their six-month high. STRK traded at $100, rising from a low of $83 in April.

2025-05-22T14:14:53.000Z,"Top Reasons Why Bitcoin (BTC) Price is Poised to Maintain a Strong Bullish Trend Until the End of the Month","The post Top Reasons Why Bitcoin (BTC) Price is Poised to Maintain a Strong Bullish Trend Until the End of the Month appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin barged into a new ATH at $111,861 on the ‘Bitcoin Pizza Day’, which turned out to be a memorable one. Despite the rise, the price is facing a lowered bearish action, suggesting the investors have turned highly optimistic over the upcoming price action. Moreover, some of the fractals suggest the BTC bull run has just begun, and hence, the price is believed to maintain a healthy ascending trend and remain consolidated within the discovery phase. The current BTC price rise was backed by an over 75% rise in the trading volume in the past 24 hours but has increased by over 100% in the past couple of days. Despite the massive rise in the bullish momentum, some of the technicals that were supposed to be overheated are pretty cool, signalling towards a major price action fast approaching. Bitcoin Funding Rate Remains Low Funding rate is an indicator of market overheating. The long bets are increasing but have not reached the peaks they marked during the previous rallies. This suggests that the future market overheating is quite negligible. Short-term Capital Inflow Plunges The short-term capital inflow can be calculated by considering the portion of BTC traded within 1 week to 1 month. This also determines the market overheating, as it displays the active supply that was last moved between 1 week and 1 month. Although the BTC price marked new highs, the short-term capital inflow is not as rapid as during the past peaks. Whales & Investors Refrain from Profit-Taking Soon after the price surges, the short-term holders tend to take profit, which has been seen in almost all of the price rises. In March 2024, the profit-taking was significant, which led to a prolonged correction. Now that the price has reached new highs, the profit-taking is much lower than in November 2024, which indicates the whales’ and the retailers’ profit-taking is limited, as they might be waiting for a massive price action. On the other hand, the Bitcoin holdings in spot ETFs have also reached an all-time high. The increased holdings by both retail and institutional investors significantly support the overall market uptrend. This suggests the Bitcoin market is still in a healthy upward phase and hence possesses huge potential to maintain a steep ascending trend to mark fresh highs in the coming days.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/top-reasons-why-bitcoin-btc-price-is-poised-to-maintain-a-strong-bullish-trend-until-the-end-of-the-month/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-05-22T14:05:35.000Z,"Bitcoin Surpasses Amazon in Market Cap After New ATH","Bitcoin’s Market Cap Milestone Bitcoin (BTC) is now the world's fifth-largest asset, with its market capitalization hitting $2.16 trillion as of May 21, 2025. The milestone comes as Bitcoin's price rose to a new all-time high of $109,400, fueled by institutional adoption and macroeconomic optimism. In comparison, the market capitalization of Amazon is $2.15 trillion, which reflects a year-to-date drop of ~8% for the technology giant. Top spots now position Bitcoin just behind gold ($22T), Microsoft ($3.3T), Apple ($3.1T), and Nvidia ($2.5T). This rise highlights Bitcoin's shift from a specialist digital commodity to store-of-value standard, with supporters pointing to its decentralization and finite supply (only 21 million BTC will be produced). The journey here has been nothing short of phenomenal. Bitcoin, which was dismissed as a speculative experiment, is now keeping company with the likes of Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, and gold. Its market cap, which is determined by multiplying its price at any time by the number of coins in circulation, recently crossed the two-trillion-dollar mark. Amazon, on the other hand, has had its own valuation drop slightly this year, which has enabled Bitcoin to move up the rankings. This rush is a demonstration of the continued development of Bitcoin both as a store of value and as an investable asset class. Bitcoin and Big Tech: A New Asset Class The most interesting aspect of this comparison, however, is how Bitcoin's market capitalization stacks up against traditional equities. Unlike Amazon or Microsoft shares, where a significant portion of the shares can be held by insiders or locked up, nearly all Bitcoin is tradable. That makes its market cap a more liquid and transparent valuation Conversely, tech behemoths have a lower ”free-float” market capitalization, as not all the shares are up for public grabs at any one time. The discrepancy is a testament to Bitcoin's odd status in the financial universe: it's a borderless, worldwide asset with no boardroom and no central authority, yet now it's competing with the most powerful companies on the planet. On everyone's lips is whether the valuation of Bitcoin is justified, and whether it can go higher still. To this end, Metcalfe's Law has some interesting insights. The law, originally applied to telecommunications networks, says that the value of a network grows exponentially as it adds more users. For Bitcoin, the active addresses and users have gone up steadily over the years, and its price has always followed suit. If the number of users is doubled, the theoretical value of the network would be four times higher according to this law. The last several years have seen Bitcoin's user count and market capitalization both increase together, giving some validity to the idea that its increase is not merely speculative but being driven by increasing utility and adoption. Naturally, Metcalfe's Law is not a crystal ball. Bitcoin's value is notoriously volatile, and short-term price moves tend to outstrip shifts in user base. Exogenous shocks — regulatory announcements, macroeconomic trends, or even breakthrough technical advances—can all move the price in ways network theory cannot anticipate. But the underlying trend is unmistakable: the more people and institutions that come into Bitcoin, the greater its network effect, which could well set the stage for future appreciation. Mining Profitability at All-Time Highs This fresh all-time high has also reshaped the environment for Bitcoin miners, the individuals and organizations that secure the network and confirm transactions. It has turned mining into enormously lucrative business at these price points for anyone with access to effective hardware and cheap electricity. The payoff for mining a new block has never been greater in dollar terms, even as competition has increased and the worldwide hash rate has hit record highs. Big mining ventures, particularly those based on renewable energy, are now experiencing reasonable margins, but smaller players might find it difficult to keep pace with escalating costs and technological requirements. Most interestingly, some mining companies are starting to diversify their business models, expanding into ancillary fields such as hosting artificial intelligence data. By taking advantage of existing infrastructure, such companies aim to acquire new sources of revenue and protect against potential future price volatility or mining difficulty for Bitcoin. This is reflective of a larger trend: as Bitcoin matures, the ecosystem that underpins it becomes more sophisticated and robust. Image suggestion: An infographic displaying the most significant factors in determining Bitcoin mining profitability, such as block rewards, hash rate, electricity cost, and equipment efficiency. Bitcoin as One of the World's Leading Assets The ramifications of Bitcoin's emergence are extensive. Bitcoin is no longer merely a speculative instrument or a cyber fad but has now captured the interest of institutional investors, governments, and ordinary savers. Its finite supply and decentralized ownership distinguish it from fiat currencies and corporate equities, with the conjunction of scarcity and accessibility. Whether it will eventually live up to its potential as ”digital gold” or mature into something else remains to be witnessed, but what it is currently doing is undeniable. As Bitcoin's market capitalization surpasses Amazon's, the world is watching economic influence get rewritten. The ascendance of the cryptocurrency isn't a tale of price graphs or headlines, but an indicator of more profound shifts in how humans consider tech, trust, and value. Though controversies and challenges undoubtedly remain, Bitcoin's status as one of the globe's leading assets is now firmly established. The only question now for watchers and investors is no longer if Bitcoin has earned its place at the table, but how far it may have to continue from here.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9229/bitcoin-surpasses-amazon-in-market-cap-after-new-ath,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-05-22T14:03:54.000Z,"Here’s what happened in crypto today","Today in crypto, Sui-based decentralized exchange (DEX) Cetus is suspected to have been exploited, with onchain data showing rapid asset drainage despite the team claiming the incident is a “bug.” Bitcoin has topped $110,000 for the first time and continues to climb, and the Texas House passed a Bitcoin reserve bill. Sui DEX Cetus hit by suspected hack: Over $200 million in potential losses Cetus, a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Sui blockchain, is suspected to have been hit by a massive exploit that may have drained more than $200 million worth of digital assets. Pseudonymous Web3 researcher COMDARE3 posted on X that “users report” that Sui-based DEX Cetus is being exploited.” They also shared a screenshot of Cetus market data on DEX Screener , showing many assets losing well over half of their value over the last 24 hours. The team behind Extractor, an onchain monitoring tool developed by crypto cybersecurity company Hacken, confirmed that “at least $63m was already bridged to Ethereum, 20k ETH was just transferred to a fresh wallet” in a single transaction . A Hacken representative told Cointelegraph that these findings were confirmed by the company’s Web3 researcher, Yehor Rudytsia. Cetus pool data shows that as of the time of writing, the DEX processed $2.9 billion worth of transactions on May 22, a significant increase over the $320 million reported on May 21. This heightened level of activity may have been caused by funds being siphoned out of the protocol. Cetus did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comments about the suspected exploit. A Sui team representative gave no comment to Cointelegraph regarding the Cetus situation. Some tokens, such as Lombard Staked BTC (LBTC) or AXOLcoin (AXOL) lost most of their value on Cetus. The top 15 losers all lost in excess of three-quarters of their price.

The cryptocurrency had well passed a a peak high of $109,458 that it hit earlier in the day, which was the first time it traded above its long-held Jan. 20 peak. Bitcoin has gained around 20% this year and has nearly doubled since its slump to $75,000 on April 7, triggered by US President Donald Trump enacting sweeping tariffs that tanked global markets. Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows it has climbed out of a slump earlier this year. Source: TradingView Bitcoin’s continued climb comes as US stock markets were rattled by a weak 20-year bond auction, which sent treasury yields soaring on May 21. The S&P 500 fell 80 points in half an hour while the Nasdaq and Dow Jones mirrored the move, with all US indexes trading down on the day. Caroline Bowler, CEO of the Australian crypto exchange BTC Markets, said in a note to Cointelegraph that Bitcoin’s continued highs were “driven by institutional-grade infrastructure and stronger regulatory clarity.” Texas House passes strategic Bitcoin reserve bill The Texas House of Representatives has passed the third reading of SB 21 , a bill that seeks to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the state. The bill passed in a 101-42 vote and will now go to Texas Governor Greg Abbott to either sign into law or veto. SB 21, authored by state Senator Charles Schwertner, establishes a Bitcoin (BTC) reserve that is managed by the state’s comptroller. The legislation allows the comptroller to invest in any cryptocurrency with a market cap above $500 billion over the previous 12-month period. Currently, the only cryptocurrency fitting the requirement is Bitcoin. Before the vote, state Representative Giovanni Capriglione said to the chamber that the bill was a “pivotal moment in securing Texas’s leadership in the digital age with the passage of our strategic Bitcoin reserve. Now, we embrace a modern asset with traditional properties for future promise.” The bill passed in the Texas Senate in a 25-5 vote on March 6.

2025-05-22T14:03:10.000Z,"Polymarket Investors Think Bitcoin Will Reach These Levels Within 9 Days! Here Are the Details","After reaching a new all-time high, expectations for Bitcoin have risen even higher. Polymarket Investors: Bitcoin Could Hit $115,000 in 9 Days Traders on predictive crypto marketplace Polymarket are assessing a 64% chance that the leading cryptocurrency will reach $115,000 in the next nine days, a striking increase from last week’s 14%. Bitcoin surged past its previous high of $108,000 on Wednesday, surpassing the $110,000 level, sparking renewed investor interest. BTC has rebounded by nearly 50% in the past two months and is on a strong rally since its low of $74,500 in early April. “Bitcoin reaching these levels is the result of a strategic accumulation against the expectation of market stress,” said crypto analyst Noelle Acheson. ETF Demand and Institutional Flows Take Precedence eToro Australia analyst Reece Hobson attributes this week’s rally to increased global liquidity and a surge in capital into spot Bitcoin ETFs, with nearly $3 billion in institutional inflows in May alone pushing Bitcoin’s price higher. Bitcoin is seen as both a risky investment vehicle similar to technology stocks and a safe haven like gold, creating a unique “dual narrative” for investors. It is stated that this approach creates a “floor” for the price to fall. Over the past two months, large Bitcoin investors have played a key role in the price increase, providing an inflow of approximately $122 billion worth of BTC to the market. This accumulation trend is interpreted as preparation for increasing economic uncertainties. “What is happening right now could be a wave of accumulation by both short-term risk-averse investors and long-term safe haven seekers,” Acheson said, summing up the dynamics in the market this way. Year-end Estimates Go Up to $150,000 Ari10 CEO Mateusz Kara said that Bitcoin could see $150,000 this year, and that factors such as the US Federal Reserve cutting interest rates and decreasing political uncertainties would be effective in this scenario. Geoff Kendrick, an analyst at Standard Chartered, predicts that Bitcoin could reach $120,000 by the end of the quarter. According to Hobson, if market volume remains strong, BTC could climb to $155,000. But There Are Warnings Too CEX.IO analyst Illia Otychenko drew attention to the 36% decrease in volume in the derivatives markets and the 29% decrease in the spot market in the last month, and emphasized that caution should be exercised regarding the permanence of this increase. “The market is stuck between upward momentum on the one hand and structural weaknesses on the other,” Otychenko said, noting that the coming weeks could be marked by sudden and sharp movements. *This is not investment advice.

The analyst asserted that the flagship crypto could witness a “long, white candlestick” leading to the rally to this range. Related Reading: Bitcoin At $118,000 Before June? Trader Reveals When As Weekly MACD Turns Bullish He had also warned that failure to break above the $106,000 range could lead to a retracement as lower timeframe momentum begins to wane. In another post, Severino explained why the range breakout was significant, noting that these breakouts in the Bitcoin price tend to offer a sustainable short-term trend to ride higher. He added that a valid range breakout should be supported by the RSI above 70 on the 3-day timeframe. The Bitcoin price currently boasts an ultra-bullish outlook, having rallied above the $110,000 mark and reached a new ATH of $111,800. Commenting on the surge to a new ATH, Severino admitted he was wrong about the bear thesis, stating that the macro fundamentals led over the technicals on this rally. The crypto analyst is confident that the Bitcoin price can go way higher. In his latest analysis, he revealed that BTC’s quarterly just triggered a perfected TD9 Sell Setup. He added that the only other time this happened was in Q4 2017, which was the most bullish quarter in crypto history. Bitcoin eventually rose by over 350% above the candlestick open. If history were to repeat itself, Severino predicts that the move will be “fast, violent, and over” sooner than anyone can imagine. He noted that up appears to be the chosen direction, which is a positive for the Bitcoin price. A Golden Cross Is Incoming For BTC In an X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto stated that a golden cross is incoming for the Bitcoin price. He remarked that BTC is repeating the same pattern, with a Death Cross happening before the Golden Cross. The analyst added that the last time this happened, it triggered a major rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Macro Trend Oscillator Shows When To Expect The Price Top In another post, Titan of Crypto predicted that the Bitcoin price could rally to as high as $135,000. He affirmed that the target is still play, with BTC likely to reach this price level this year. Meanwhile, veteran analyst Peter Brandt suggested that Bitcoin could rally to between $125,000 and $150,000 by August. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $111,300, up over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

2025-05-22T13:55:03.000Z,"Cardano Price Reclaims $0.80 As Bullish Setup Reignites, $0.85 In Sight For ADA","The post Cardano Price Reclaims $0.80 As Bullish Setup Reignites, $0.85 In Sight For ADA appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Key Takeaways ADA reclaimed $0.80 after bouncing from $0.71, forming a bullish higher-low structure. Momentum flipped positive , with RSI > 60 and MACD showing a fresh bullish crossover. BBTrend surged to +5.22 , signaling strong volatility and breakout potential. Open interest hit $917M , marking its highest level in 2025 and confirming rising trader confidence. Bitcoin hit a fresh all-time high of $111,861 on May 22, pushing the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 73 (Greed) —its highest reading in weeks. This surge in sentiment has triggered renewed momentum across major altcoins, with Cardano (ADA) reclaiming the $0.80 mark and flashing signs of a bullish continuation. Will momentum hold into next week? ADA/USD Structure Recovery Backed by Momentum Shift Cardano’s price action has seen sharp turns in 2025. On March 2 , ADA surged from $0.64 to $1.19 — its biggest one-day spike this year, a gain of +85% . But profit-taking led to a deep correction, bottoming out at $0.5114 on April 2 , a -57% drop . Since then, ADA has been rebuilding, climbing to $0.84 on May 10 , then briefly correcting to $0.71 on May 19 , before bouncing back above $0.80 . This climb is supported by a bullish structure of higher lows. Price now trades above a rising trendline, with key support at $0.7526 (0.236 Fib) and resistance at $0.8533 (0.5 Fib). A break above this zone could open the door to $0.934 (0.618 Fib) in the short term. Cardano price indicator setup has also shifted bullishly . RSI recovered from 45–48 on May 19 to above 61.13 , reflecting improving buying strength. MACD completed a bullish crossover on May 21–22, with expanding green histogram bars signaling fresh momentum. Most notably, the BBTrend , which tracks directional strength using Bollinger Band volatility, flipped from negative to +8.9913 — its highest reading in months. This confirms rising volatility alongside bullish price action, helping validate the breakout attempt. Volume trends further support the move. After a quiet start to May, spot and derivatives activity has surged , with open interest now at $917M — the highest in 2025. This signals rising conviction among traders and real capital inflow behind the price push. Short-Term Forecast: Bullish, With Caution If ADA holds above the $0.75–$0.77 support band this week, a retest of the $0.85 level is likely. A clean breakout above $0.853 could accelerate gains toward $0.93–$0.94 in the next 7–10 days. However, failure to sustain above $0.75 would expose ADA to downside risk toward $0.72 or even $0.647 in a broader pullback. Verdict: Bullish Bias with Near-Term Upside The technical and on-chain picture supports a bullish bias for ADA in the short term, especially if momentum sustains above key Fib levels. While resistance at $0.85 may cause temporary friction, the overall structure favours upside continuation, potentially targeting $0.93 within the next 10 days.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/cardano-price-reclaims-0-80-as-bullish-setup-reignites-0-85-in-sight-for-ada/,"ADA|ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-05-22T13:54:01.000Z,"Which senators invest in crypto? 11 lawmakers have blockchain-related investments","As the question of stablecoin regulation heats up in the US Senate, so has the issue of which members are personally invested in cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency firms. On May 19, the Senate voted to invoke cloture and move ahead with the GENIUS Act, which would provide a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The measure passed 66-32, with 16 Democrats supporting the bill. Democratic concerns over corruption and politicians’ ties to cryptocurrency firms made the bipartisan move controversial. After the vote was finished, Colorado Senator Michael Bennet introduced the STABLE GENIUS Act. The bill would prevent members of Congress from issuing or investing in digital currency and require them to put their crypto in a blind trust while in office. Bills to prevent members of Congress from investing in companies they regulate have had little success. However, lawmakers are still required to disclose rough estimations of their, their spouse’s and their children’s investments. Here are 11 US senators who have invested in crypto firms. Montana Tim Sheehy, Republican Tim Sheehy is a newcomer to the Senate, first securing his election in the 2024 cycle.

2025-05-22T13:51:36.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Shatters $110,000, Sets New All-Time High","Bitcoin (BTC) smashed its previous all-time high and crossed the $110,000 mark for the first time. The flagship cryptocurrency had teased a move higher earlier in the week when it briefly crossed $107,000. BTC is up nearly 4% in the past 24 hours as it tests the waters above $110,000. BTC’s rally puts the flagship cryptocurrency in uncharted territory as it enters a period of price discovery. Bitcoin hit an intraday high of $111,726 earlier in the session before retreating to current levels. Bitcoin (BTC) Surges To New All-Time High Bitcoin (BTC) shattered the $110,000 level and surged to a new all-time high of $111,726 as market sentiment improved. The flagship cryptocurrency had teased a move past this level earlier in the week as markets recovered from the trade war and tariff-induced selloffs. Bitcoin’s rally was driven by several factors, including easing trade tensions, clarity around tariffs, and Moody’s downgrade of US sovereign debt, prompting investors to seek alternative investments. Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of digital asset trading platform Nexo, stated, “Now that January's high has been surpassed - and the 50 percent upside from April's lows has been achieved - bitcoin enters blue sky territory with tailwinds in the form of institutional momentum and a favorable U.S. regulatory environment.” Market watchers also highlighted growing institutional interest and participation as another driver of the rally. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a longtime crypto skeptic, recently said the bank would allow its clients to purchase Bitcoin. Coinbase was also added to the S&P 500 index, further boosting investor sentiment. “We're still in year four of the bitcoin price cycle - the year after the bitcoin halving when miner rewards are slashed in half - which historically means its best days are still ahead of it and - while macro uncertainty and the threat of further volatility remains, a target of $150,000 in 2025 is still very much on the cards.” What’s Behind The Bitcoin (BTC) Rally? BTC soared past its previous all-time high, set at the beginning of the year, rising to $111,726 after registering a sharp increase of above 4% in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has risen over 23% in the past month, posting a sharp reversal from April’s downturn. The flagship cryptocurrency’s rally mirrors the ongoing recovery in US equities despite Wednesday’s selloff. The S&P 500 has risen 15% since late April, while the Nasdaq is up over 21%. Analysts have attributed the increase to growing optimism about President Trump’s trade policies and easing trade tensions between the US and China. Texas Approves Bitcoin Reserve Bill Texas is close to becoming the third US state to establish and manage a Bitcoin reserver after the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Investment Act, SB 21, was approved by the House of Representatives with a vote of 101-42. The bill will now be sent to Governor Greg Abbott for approval. The bill authorizes the state comptroller to invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with a market cap of over $500 billion over the past 12 months. Bitcoin is the only asset that meets this criteria. The bill also directs the creation of a formal Bitcoin reserve and positions the state to diversify its financial strategy by investing in digital assets. If signed, Texas will join New Hampshire and potentially Arizona to become the only US state to establish a Bitcoin reserve. However, governors in Arizona and Montana voted to block similar proposals, citing extreme volatility in the crypto markets. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) rallied to a new all-time high after finally crossing $110,000 and reaching $111,726. The move was driven by growing optimism around crypto regulation, institutional interest in BTC , and easing trade tensions. A broader rally in the US markets also buoyed investor sentiment. James Butterfill, head of research for crypto-focused asset manager CoinShares, stated, “The rally was also helped along by broader macro concerns, including Moody’s recent downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, which added to the narrative of Bitcoin as a hedge against fiat instability.” There have also been positive developments for crypto on the regulatory front, with the GENIUS Act, a key bill for stablecoin regulation, clearing a key procedural vote in the Senate. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have also registered steady inflows, according to analysts. BTC started the previous week in the red, dropping over 1% on Monday and settling at $102,728. The price recovered on Tuesday, registering an increase of 1.36% and settling at $104,123. BTC was back in the red on Wednesday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $103,568. The price plunged to an intraday low of $101,459 on Thursday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $103,816. Price action turned bearish on Friday and Saturday as BTC registered marginal declines and settled at $103,235. Despite the selling pressure, BTC recovered on Sunday, rising over 3% to cross $106,000 and settling at $106,489.

Market sentiment turned bullish on Tuesday as BTC rose 1.21% and settled at $106,854. The price continued to push higher on Wednesday, rising 2.57% to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,604.

The flagship cryptocurrency smashed its previous all-time high, surging past $110,000 late Wednesday after teasing the move since the beginning of the week. Momentum sustained itself even after US equity markets closed for the day. BTC is up nearly 4% over the past 24 hours, trading around $111,400. Buoyed by BTC, Ethereum (ETH) also registered a notable rally, rising almost 2% to reclaim $2,600 and move to $2,636.

What’s Driving Crypto’s Latest Rally? Bitcoin (BTC) shattered its previous all-time high as the flagship cryptocurrency surged past $110,000 and moved to its current level above $111,000. The rally puts BTC in uncharted territory as it enters a price discovery phase. Others, including Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Cardano (ADA), also rallied, pushing the crypto market cap into positive territory. Data from Coinglass revealed the rally led to over $500 million in liquidations in the past 24 hours, highlighting the intensity of the breakout. The main factor driving the crypto market’s latest rally is BTC surging past $110,000 and entering uncharted territory. Analysts suggest the rally could continue, and the price could hit $120,000. Stablecoin Bill Could Unlock Trillions For US Treasury White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks believes the stablecoin legislation could unlock trillions for the US treasury by boosting Treasury demand. Sacks also said he believes the bill will pass through the Senate with significant bipartisan support. Sacks stated in an interview, “We already have over $200 billion in stablecoins. It's just unregulated. If we provide the legal clarity and legal framework for this, I think we could create trillions of dollars of demand for our Treasuries practically overnight, very quickly.” The GENIUS Act cleared a procedural vote in the Senate, with 15 Democrats voting for it to pass the threshold this week. This means the bill's proponents have the necessary votes to avoid a filibuster. “We have every expectation now that it's going to pass.” Democrats had previously rejected the GENIUS Act, flagging concerns about President Trump’s cryptocurrency ventures, including a personal meme coin and a stablecoin from his family’s crypto business. According to Democrats, this created an unprecedented conflict of interest. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is tied to a real-world asset. The stablecoin market is dominated by Tether’s USDT, which has a 60% market share. According to Deutsche Bank, stablecoin transactions hit a staggering $28 trillion in 2024, surpassing Mastercard and Visa combined. Sacks believes the GENIUS Act is more than just a crypto breakthrough, describing it as a national economic strategy. “Stablecoins offer a new, more efficient, cheaper, smoother payment system — new payment rails for the US economy. It also extends the dominance of the dollar online.” Binance To List USD1 Stablecoin Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, will list World Liberty Financial’s USD1 stablecoin on May 22, with withdrawals opening the following day.

USD1 is backed by cash, short-term US Treasuries, and Dollar deposits and is issued and managed by BitGo Trust Company. World Liberty Financial conducts regular reserve audits, although detailed breakdowns remain private. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) shattered its previous all-time high as it surged past $110,000 late Wednesday. The flagship cryptocurrency had teased a move past $110,000 earlier in the week when it briefly crossed the $107,000 mark before losing momentum and registering a marginal decline. BTC has gradually pushed higher during the week despite a tumultuous start, which saw the price dip to a low of $102,135 on Monday. However, the price gradually recovered before moving past its all-time high on Wednesday. BTC reached an intraday high of $111,726 during the ongoing session before registering a marginal decline and moving to its current level of $110,604. Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of the digital asset trading platform Nexo, stated, “Now that January's high has been surpassed - and the 50 percent upside from April's lows has been achieved - bitcoin enters blue sky territory with tailwinds in the form of institutional momentum and a favorable U.S. regulatory environment.” BTC sometimes trades in tandem with tech stocks and assets that rise in value when investor sentiment is in positive territory. Earlier in the week, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the bank will allow its clients to purchase Bitcoin . Dimon is a long-time crypto skeptic who has criticized BTC and other digital assets on several occasions. “We're still in year four of the bitcoin price cycle - the year after the bitcoin halving when miner rewards are slashed in half - which historically means its best days are still ahead of it and - while macro uncertainty and the threat of further volatility remains, a target of $150,000 in 2025 is still very much on the cards.” BTC’s rally mirrors the broader recovery in US equities. The increase comes despite Wednesday’s selloff. The S&P 500 has registered a 15% increase since late April, while the Nasdaq is up over 21%. Analysts attribute the bounce in the traditional and crypto markets to growing optimism about less aggressive trade policies. BTC started the previous week on a volatile note as buyers and sellers struggled for control. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price registered a drop of 1.04% and settled at $102,728. BTC recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.36% to $104,123, but fell back on Wednesday, dropping 0.53% to $103,568. The price plunged to an intraday low of $101,459 on Thursday as selling pressure intensified. However, the price rebounded from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $103,816. Selling pressure returned as BTC registered marginal declines on Friday and Saturday, registering marginal declines and settling at $103,235.

However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,572, ultimately registering a decline of nearly 1%. Market sentiment turned bullish on Tuesday as BTC rose 1.21% and settled at $106,854. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as BTC rose almost 3% to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,604, settling a new all-time high. BTC extended its gains during the ongoing session, reaching an intraday high of $111,726 before registering a marginal decline to its current levels. Analysts believe BTC’s rally could continue as it enters a price discovery phase. The immediate target is $115,000, but a move past this level could see the price reach $120,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) price action has stabilized after a volatile start to the week, with the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency reclaiming the $2,600 level as buying activity picks up. ETH bulls will look to build momentum and push towards $2,800. ETH’s recovery and stunning increase over the past month mean ETH holders are back in profit, increasing the chances of the price crossing the $3,000 mark. However, ETH must first cross the $2,800 resistance, a level where it has faced rejection earlier. Around 2.27 million ETH could be sold at this level. ETH’s latest rally has pushed it above its realized price or cost basis. ETH holders returning to profit after registering unrealized losses has also provided financial relief for holders, reinforcing a bullish outlook for the asset. Despite ETH’s recent positivity, it started the previous week facing volatility and selling pressure. The price ultimately registered a marginal decline after sellers gained the upper hand. Despite a negative start, ETH rebounded on Tuesday, rising over 7% to cross $2,600 and settle at $2,681. However, it lost momentum on Wednesday, dropping 2.64% and settling at $2,610. ETH declined on Thursday, falling over 2%, slipping below $2,600, and settling at $2,548. Buyers attempted a recovery on Friday as the price rose to an intraday high of $2,648. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped to $2,537, ultimately registering a marginal decline. Source: TradingView Bearish sentiment intensified on Saturday as ETH fell 2.44% to $2,476. The price overcame volatility to register an increase of almost 1% on Sunday and end the weekend on a bullish note. ETH plunged to an intraday low of $2,326 on Monday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to register an increase of 1.19%, reclaim $2,500 and settle at $2,527. The price registered a marginal decline on Tuesday before rising 1.11% on Wednesday and settling at $2,552. The current session has seen ETH extend its gains, with the price up over 4%, trading around $2,663. Buyers will look to maintain momentum and test the $2,800 resistance. A break above this level could see ETH surge to $3,000. A bullish MACD indicates buyers have the upper hand. However, the RSI is in the overbought zone, suggesting a decline is inevitable. Despite ETH’s price jump, analysts pointed out that the Active Realised Price sits around $2,900 and remains a key level that must be reclaimed to support continued price appreciation. “The $2,400–$2,900 range remains a crucial area for Ethereum, acting as both a resistance zone and a potential breakout level essential for maintaining upward momentum.” Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) is rising toward the $180 mark as the blockchain gears up for the release of Seeker. SOL started the previous week positively despite facing volatility, increasing 0.60% to $174. The price plunged to an intraday low of $165 as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to register an increase of 5.50%, crossing $180 and settling at $183. SOL lost momentum after reaching this level and fell nearly 4%, slipping below $180 and the 200-day SMA and settling at $176. The price continued downwards on Thursday, falling over 4% to $169. Sellers retained control on Friday as SOL fell almost 1% and settled at $167. Source: TradingView SOL started the weekend in the red as its downtrend continued, dropping 0.89% and settled at $165. The price rebounded on Sunday, rising over 4% to reclaim $170 and settle at $173. Despite the positive sentiment, SOL plunged to an intraday low of $159 on Monday as selling pressure intensified.

2025-05-22T13:44:58.000Z,"BTC Hits $110K, XRP Follows , What Does That Mean for Pepeto, Solaxy, and the Future of Crypto?","The post BTC Hits $110K, XRP Follows , What Does That Mean for Pepeto, Solaxy, and the Future of Crypto? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Solaxy Could Grow , But Is It Really What Solana Needs? If you’re holding Solaxy or looking at it, there’s something you should know now that the market is heating up. With Bitcoin breaking above $110,000 and XRP moving higher , the whole crypto space is getting attention again. Investors are rushing to look at new projects , especially meme coins. That’s why Solaxy is starting to trend. It calls itself the first Layer 2 built on Solana , and yes , that sounds exciting. But let’s take a closer look. Layer 2 technology helps slow and expensive blockchains like Ethereum. It makes transactions faster and fees cheaper. But Solana is already one of the fastest and cheapest chains in crypto . So adding a Layer 2 doesn’t really fix a problem , because there wasn’t one to begin with . That’s where the question comes in. Solaxy might still grow , maybe even 5x , but it might not go much further, simply because its technology doesn’t bring major change to the Solana ecosystem. That’s why some investors are saying:. And that’s exactly when Pepeto enters the picture , with real tools, a deep story, and growing momentum . Pepeto Has a Stronger Foundation , Tech, Story, and Real Market Impact If Solaxy is catching early interest, Pepeto is quickly turning into the headline. It’s not just another meme coin, it’s a full-on crypto platform being built piece by piece. The team behind Pepeto is launching a dedicated exchange , where many of the newest meme coins of 2025 will be listed. That means daily users, daily traffic, and most importantly , real value for the $PEPETO token . Every coin that launches on the Pepeto exchange will bring new eyes and new utility. But Pepeto goes even further. It’s building PepetoSwap , a special swap platform that connects multiple blockchains , thanks to bridge technology . Want to move your tokens from Ethereum to Solana? Or from BNB Chain to Avalanche? PepetoSwap makes that easy, fast, and cheap. It’s solving a real problem that many traders face today , and doing it with a fun, meme-powered brand that also delivers value. Here’s what makes Pepeto one of the most talked-about meme coins right now : A new exchange just for meme coins launching in 2025 PepetoSwap a tool for trading across blockchains Fast and cheap bridge technology for better access A staking system that rewards token holders An active, growing community that supports the project Tier 1 exchange listings already in the works A unique backstory that links it directly to Pepe the Frog The Real Story Behind Pepeto and Why It’s Bigger Than Just Hype Many believe that the meme coin world changed when Pepe the Frog launched but not everyone knows the full story. Some say Pepe’s success came from stealing four original documents from an early-stage project called Pepeto. These documents were titled P, E, P, and E , standing for Precision, Energy, Power, and Efficiency . Pepe launched fast, grabbed the spotlight, but left out two important parts: T for Technology , and O for Optimization . That’s what the word “ Pepeto ” really means. It’s the full picture. And that’s why Pepeto calls itself the God of Frogs , not just another copy. https://www.instagram.com/reel/DB1QEqrP96L/?igsh=MzdsbGxoaHRmazJt Now, rumors are growing people believe that the original Pepe founder , who was left out and betrayed, is actually the one now building Pepeto. If that’s true, this isn’t just a comeback — it’s a mission to finish what was started, with the right tools, a powerful brand, and a strong plan to grow. The Bottom Line: Pepeto Brings Real Utility in a Time When Meme Coins Must Offer More With Bitcoin surging past $110K and XRP regaining momentum , the crypto market is clearly waking up. But investors are getting smarter. Hype isn’t enough anymore. Projects need real value, real tools, and real communities . That’s where Pepeto checks every box. It has the exchange . It has the bridge tech . It has the story . And it might just have the founder who started it all . Stay in touch with Pepeto announcement via tg : https://t.me/pepeto_channel Solaxy might still rise maybe a clean 5x , as the first of its kind on Solana. But if you’re looking for the next big meme coin that mixes humor, hype, and serious tools, Pepeto may be the one that leads the next era . Joining the $PEPETO project takes just a few simple steps: Set Up a Crypto Wallet – Use a wallet that supports Ethereum, such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Deposit Funds – Add ETH, USDT, or BNB to your wallet. Participate in the Presale – Go to pepeto.io to purchase your $PEPETO tokens. Stake Your Holdings – Access the staking platform to start earning passive rewards. Why $PEPETO Stands Out $PEPETO brings together the viral appeal of meme coins with real blockchain utility. From a zero-fee trading platform and cross-chain bridge to high staking incentives, it’s positioned as a major contender in the evolving crypto landscape, especially heading into 2025.

2025-05-22T13:41:39.000Z,"Crypto Tax Filings Nearly Double in Finland, But Majority Remain Undeclared","Key Takeaways: Crypto tax filings in Finland nearly doubled in a year, but only a fraction of holders report trades. Authorities are ramping up enforcement, including asset seizures and cross-border crackdowns. Garantex exchange was dismantled after processing $96B linked to illicit activity since 2019. The number of Finnish taxpayers reporting cryptocurrency trades has nearly doubled, rising from 8,200 to 16,000 in just one year, according to local media outlet Uutissuomalainen . Despite the surge, the figure still pales in comparison to the estimated 300,000 Finns believed to hold digital assets. In last year’s filings, declared crypto-related gains reached €230 million, with losses totaling €30 million—both significantly higher than the combined €50 million declared two years ago. Finland’s Crypto Boom Outpaces Tax Compliance The data points to rising engagement in crypto markets, but also highlights the gap between actual ownership and compliance. Since May 2019, Finland’s Financial Supervisory Authority (FIN-FSA) has been responsible for overseeing the country’s crypto sector, including exchanges and wallet providers. Under Finnish law, all crypto service providers operating domestically must register and comply with financial regulations. The latest numbers suggest enforcement and awareness are growing—but full transparency remains elusive. In January, Finnish police seized around $2.68 million worth of luxury watches from Hex founder Richard Schueler, also known as Richard Heart, as part of an ongoing investigation into tax fraud and assault. The 20 high-end watches, mostly Rolexes, were discovered in a residence in Espoo and are believed to belong to Schueler. Authorities used intelligence efforts to trace the abandoned collection, with purchases made in both Finland and the U.S. Eight of the watches were officially confiscated, according to Inspector Harri Saaristola, who is leading the investigation. In March, the US Justice Department, in coordination with Germany and Finland, dismantled the online infrastructure of Garantex , a cryptocurrency exchange accused of facilitating money laundering for criminal and terrorist organizations. The exchange, which has processed at least $96 billion in cryptocurrency transactions since 2019, has been taken offline following law enforcement action. Denmark Considers Taxing Unrealized Crypto Gains Denmark’s Tax Law Council has proposed a bill that would tax unrealized gains and losses on crypto holdings, potentially starting in 2026. The recommendation is detailed in a 93-page report and suggests a unified tax model for all digital assets. The council evaluated three frameworks for crypto taxation: capital gains, warehouse taxation, and inventory accounting. This initiative mirrors a growing international shift toward stricter tax enforcement on crypto and other financial assets. Italy is also tightening its stance. Vice Economy Minister Maurizio Leo recently announced plans to raise the capital gains tax on cryptocurrencies from 26% to 42% , specifically citing Bitcoin.

Shiba Inu gained widespread fame by turning small amounts into life-changing profits, climbing more than 80,000,000% from its debut price to its peak, making it one of crypto’s biggest stories. Pepe followed closely, surging rapidly and delivering strong returns to its initial supporters as it rose through the meme coin ranks. However, both projects now seem to have limited upside. Shiba Inu’s market cap is deep in the billions, and Pepe remains close to its highs, making it difficult to see the same kind of explosive growth again. Influencer Pepe (INPEPE) is gaining traction as the next-gen memecoin, uniquely positioned at the intersection of Web3 and the booming $25+ billion influencer economy. Unlike traditional meme tokens, INPEPE aims to be the official currency for influencer payments, offering: Instant, borderless payouts No middlemen or platform fees On-chain proof of performance and engagement INPEPE doesn’t just ride the meme wave—it provides a tangible solution for content creators struggling with delayed payments and platform limitations. This real-world utility is what separates INPEPE from hype-only coins. That’s why Influencer Pepe (INPEPE) is now grabbing attention. In its presale phase, Influencer Pepe (INPEPE) is gaining momentum thanks to its dramatic backstor and expanding community. With a current price of $0.0000002042 per token, Influencer Pepe (INPEPE) presents a rare early entry point and making it to be the next big meme coin breakout. Pepe and Influencer Pepe (INPEPE): The Buzz, Shiba’s Path, and Why Influencer Pepe (INPEPE) Could Lead the Next Wave Rumors about a connection between Pepe and Influencer Pepe (INPEPE) continue to generate discussion within crypto circles, keeping investors intrigued. Influencer Pepe (INPEPE) claims to complete the vision, aiming to offer long-term value and real use cases that set it apart from typical meme coins. Influencer Pepe (INPEPE) is positioning itself as a stronger and more complete project than both Shiba and Pepe. As momentum builds, many believe Influencer Pepe (INPEPE) could achieve gains that rival or even surpass those of Shiba and Pepe. Presales like Influencer Pepe (INPEPE)’s highlight why early entry can be a game-changer: lower price, more potential, and a vision backed by real tools. Can INPEPE Deliver 100x Returns Like PEPE? If you invest $10,000 in Influencer Pepe (INPEPE) at the current price of $0.0000002042, you’d be holding nearly 49 million tokens. Should INPEPE climb to PEPE’s peak price of $0.00001308, that investment could skyrocket to over $640,000—offering a potential 60x+ return. Considering both projects share the same token supply and INPEPE is gaining traction with rumors of a Tier 1 exchange listing, the upside remains significant.

Investing in digital assets is becoming increasingly important in the “world of the exponential age and currency debasement,” according to Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Global Macro Investor. “You don’t own enough crypto. When you do, you don’t own enough NFT’s, as art is upstream of wealth. Both will never be this cheap again,” Pal said. NFTs are “the single best long term store of wealth I know and you get to buy it before network effects kick in,” he added in another response. Source: Raoul Pal “There is some validity to the statement that NFTs, and in extension art, become a vehicle for the wealthy once a certain level of wealth is reached,” wrote Nicolai Sondergaard, research analyst at Nansen, calling it a “natural move” for asset diversification. “For traders and investors, further down the wealth curve, NFTs are partially about speculating on future returns,” he told Cointelegraph, adding that NFTs also benefit from the allure of strong communities, beyond just wealth creation. Related: German gov’t missed out on $2.3B profit after selling Bitcoin at $57K Art NFTs may see a resurgence as “digital ownership gains acceptance among younger, tech-savvy cohorts,” if collections manage to move past the “speculative fervor,” according to Anndy Lian, author and intergovernmental blockchain expert. Still, Lian said broader adoption depends on blockchain networks improving scalability and security to “instill confidence.” He added that art NFTs “must transcend hype, anchoring value in cultural significance or utility.” Beeple’s “Everydays: The First 5000 Days.” Source: Christies Some digital artists made millions of dollars through NFTs.

Shiba Inu gained notoriety by transforming modest investments into substantial fortunes, soaring by over 80,000,000% from its initial price to its peak, securing its place among cryptocurrency’s top success stories. Pepe followed a similar trajectory, making headlines with a rapid ascent that propelled it into the meme coin elite, offering significant profits to early adopters. However, as both tokens have matured, their growth potential appears to have diminished, making it more challenging to replicate past performances.

INPEPE aims to revolutionize the influencer economy by offering instant, borderless payouts, eliminating middlemen and platform fees, and providing on-chain proof of performance and engagement.

2025-05-22T13:38:31.000Z,"Why is the Dow Jones tumbling while Bitcoin and altcoins are rising?","Bitcoin and altcoins continued soaring on Thursday, even as the US stock market downturn continued. Bitcoin ( BTC ) jumped to a record high of $111,860, while the market cap of all cryptocurrencies jumped to $3.5 trillion. In contrast, the Dow opened lower by around 100 points, adding to Wednesday’s 816 point drop. Bitcoin and altcoins are climbing after the U.S. Senate passed the GENIUS Act , a first-of-its-kind cryptocurrency regulation focused on stablecoins. The legislation requires stablecoin issuers to maintain 100 percent reserve backing with high-quality assets such as U.S. Treasuries and the dollar. It also mandates monthly disclosures detailing reserve composition. Other provisions include federal and state oversight. Stablecoin issuers with assets above 10 billion dollars will be regulated at the federal level, while states will oversee smaller issuers with less than 10 billion dollars in assets. The passage of the GENIUS Act is significant, as it helps safeguard the crypto industry, especially following the collapse of Terra in 2022 and other major failures, like FTX. It also provides long-awaited legal clarity. Bitcoin as a safe haven after the US credit rating downgrade Bitcoin and altcoins are rising because investors see BTC as a safe haven asset after Moody’s downgraded the US credit rating . The safe-haven appeal has pushed investors into spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have added over $4.2 billion in inflows this month, bringing the cumulative total to $43 billion. In its statement, Moody’s pointed to the rising US debt and interest payments and the policies in Washington. For example, the House of Representatives passed the “big, beautiful bill” that will add around $3.8 trillion in additional debt , according to some estimates. You might also like: Why Trump’s ‘big, beautiful’ bill is bullish for Bitcoin and altcoins The bill extends the 2017 tax cuts and introduces new ones, including deductions on tips and overtime pay. It also expands the child tax credit and includes a new senior tax relief of 4,000 dollars. Fears over the rising U.S. debt and deficit have led investors to pull back from U.S. assets, especially equities. The U.S. Dollar Index has dropped to 99.6, while bond yields have surged.

On the daily chart, it has formed a cup and handle pattern while narrowly avoiding a death cross. A death cross occurs when the 50-day and 200-day moving averages cross while trending downward. This same setup nearly played out in August last year but was avoided. The cup pattern has a depth of about 30 percent. Measuring that distance from the breakout level suggests potential gains toward 141,000 dollars.

2025-05-22T13:30:43.000Z,"Crypto Trader Dumps XRP Holdings For Ethereum, Explains Why","A prominent crypto trader on the X (formerly Twitter) platform has made waves on social media after revealing that he sold off all of his XRP holdings in order to buy Ethereum . The trader who is known as Doctor Profit on social media revealed this to his over 400,000 followers on the platform, along with reasons why he made this move and what he expects going forward. Dump XRP For 600% Gains To Buy Ethereum Doctor Profit had first revealed on May 19 his intent to begin selling his XRP stash. In this initial post, he revealed that all of his XRP was bought at very low prices between $0.2 and $0.5, putting his entry very low. At the current price at the time, the crypto trader was sitting on a profit of approximately 608% at this point. This was when he told his followers that he intended to start selling his XRP investments after holding onto them for three years. He further explained that he was only selling XRP and no other cryptocurrencies or even Bitcoin. Rather, he was selling to be able to buy more later at a much cheaper price. Then in a follow-up post on May 20, Doctor Profit finally revealed his full plan when it comes to selling XRP. Apparently, the crypto trader had decided to dump all of his XRP in order to buy Ethereum, a move which he referred to as “a matter of capital appreciation.” The reason for this is because Doctor Profit believes that the Ethereum price could see a major increase in the near term. As for XRP, he explained that selling his stash did not mean that he expected the XRP price to crash. Rather, it was because holding XRP didn’t make sense in the short term and was a more long-term investment. Thus, he plans to take the gains made from the Ethereum investment and then reinvest them at a later date when a good entry is presented. But for now, Doctor Profit confirmed that all of the profits made from his XRP investment in the last three years have now been moved into Ethereum. Bullish Outlook For The Market Remains Back during the decline that plagued the crypto market from January to March 2025, Doctor Profit was one of the analysts who called the price bottom when Bitcoin had dropped to $77,000 . From there, the analyst had called that Bitcoin would rebound back above $100,000, maintaining that a new all-time high is possible. So far, his $100,000 prediction has come to pass, and the all-time high forecast was completed after Bitcoin breached $109,300 on Wednesday. For Ethereum, the analyst’s bullish thesis has been around for a while. He has previously called Ethereum the best opportunity as its technical, on-chain, and psychological indicators have turned bullish. He believes that the Ethereum price can rise as high as $7,600, with a lot of liquidity pooling around $4,000.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-trader-xrp-ethereum/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Ethereum|XRP|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT",cryptocompare
2025-05-22T13:30:00.000Z,"How staking incentivizes trust without burning energy","What if a financial system could run itself not by burning electricity, but by rewarding good behavior? That’s the promise of staking, a mechanism that powers many modern blockchains by turning users into network operators. In this week’s episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast , hosts Gareth Jenkinson and Nathan Jeffay sit down with StarkWare’s Noam Nisan to unpack how this trustless engine works, why it matters and what’s really at stake. Understanding staking Jeffay began by highlighting how staking is part of the backbone that keeps the blockchain running, and runs itself, with volunteers. “By doing this, they’re saying, OK, we’re taking this task of running the blockchain seriously. Here's some of our money. We're putting it down. We're showing that we're serious about doing this.” To help unpack this topic further and examine the deeper mechanics behind staking, the hosts are joined by Noam Nisan, principal researcher at StarkWare and a widely respected computer scientist who has held roles at Google and Princeton. Related: How to handle crypto trading gains and losses on your balance sheet “So we have this general system with operators... Why would they want to do that? The system, the protocol, incentivizes them to actually run the system,” Nisan explained. “Basically, it can give them tokens for operating the system.” Staking offers what Nisan describes as two distinct types of security: computer science-based guarantees and economic disincentives for bad actors. “If a majority or supermajority, maybe two-thirds of the parties of the token of the staked amount are behaving properly... we can prove that the system acts correctly,” he said. “But you also have what I would call an economic guarantee... if they destroy the system, very likely the value of the token... will go down. So they are the one losing.” PoW vs PoS Jenkinson, a vocal Bitcoin ( BTC ) supporter, posed the classic comparison: proof-of-work vs proof-of-stake. “Do you have any strong feelings about one or the other?” he asked. “The truth is that it’s not clear.. it's really a social question, I think.” Nisan noted that both mechanisms involve trade-offs around cost, control, and decentralization. The episode also explores the role of staking in tokenomics and system design. Nisan unpacks how fee mechanics and inflation controls, such as Ethereum’s minting curve, help keep the ecosystem in balance.

2025-05-22T13:27:13.000Z,"BTC News Analysis: Why Financial Experts Compare Bitcoin Solaris to Bitcoin Circa 2013","In 2013, Bitcoin was still an emerging digital asset with a small user base, minimal institutional exposure, and mining accessible from consumer-grade hardware. It was a period when network participation — not price speculation — was the primary driver of value accumulation. That phase gave early adopters long-term upside unmatched by nearly any asset class in the decade since. Now, a growing number of analysts are pointing to Bitcoin Solaris as the first credible protocol in years to recreate the mechanics that defined Bitcoin’s early trajectory. The comparison is not aesthetic or thematic. It’s based on structure: fixed supply, decentralized distribution, and real earnings tied to user activity. Mobile Mining Replaces Hardware Dependency Bitcoin Solaris allows users to mine BTC-S tokens directly from their smartphones through the Nova App. By allocating 1–5 GB of device storage and light background CPU usage, users will earn BTC-S passively — especially while devices are idle or charging. There is no staking mechanism, no validator configuration, and no reliance on token trading to receive rewards. This mirrors Bitcoin’s early mining economy, where participation rewarded technical contribution. The difference is accessibility. With Bitcoin Solaris, the requirement is not a GPU or ASIC — but a smartphone, making it feasible for millions of users globally to participate directly in the protocol. Infrastructure Built for Passive Income The blockchain is structured across two integrated layers. The Base Layer uses Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Capacity (PoC) to maintain ledger integrity efficiently. The Solaris Layer leverages Proof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Time (PoT) to execute mobile mining and smart contracts at 10,000+ TPS, with a finality time of 2 seconds. This design supports high-volume mining across thousands of nodes simultaneously and ensures that protocol rewards are distributed quickly, securely, and without congestion. It’s optimized not just for performance — but for continuous, low-friction earnings. BTC-S Presale Mirrors Early BTC Conditions Bitcoin Solaris is currently in Presale Phase 4, with BTC-S priced at 4 USDT. A total of 4.2 million BTC-S — 20% of the fixed 21 million supply — is allocated to presale participants. There is no inflation mechanism; future distribution will be governed strictly through mining or validator activity. Early buyers are not only accessing BTC-S at a fixed price—they’re securing network entry before Nova App mining begins. Once the app goes live, mining competition will increase, and token availability will decrease. The current presale offers an asymmetry similar to Bitcoin’s early distribution era, where those who engaged before market saturation saw long-term exponential returns. In a recent analysis, Crypto Volt highlights the structural parallels between Bitcoin in 2013 and Bitcoin Solaris today. The video outlines how Nova App mining, capped supply, and presale conditions offer a rare chance to replicate early-stage crypto dynamics — with the benefit of mobile-first design and audited infrastructure. Fully Audited and Verified Bitcoin Solaris has undergone comprehensive third-party verification to confirm the integrity of its smart contracts, token emission structure, and mobile mining architecture. A full audit conducted by Cyberscope reviewed the protocol’s contract logic and validated its compliance with emission parameters. A separate evaluation by Freshcoins examined system scalability, ensuring the infrastructure could reliably support high-volume mining and real-time transaction processing. The team has also completed KYC verification , providing transparency around governance and project oversight. These layers of independent review offer assurance that Bitcoin Solaris operates on verifiable code, not trust—critical for retail users entering before broader market exposure. Bitcoin’s 2013 phase was marked by low entry points, direct protocol rewards, and exponential upside for early participants. Bitcoin Solaris is now being compared to that period not for nostalgia, but for structure. It offers real earnings from a fixed-supply network, distributed via mobile mining, with the core mechanics already in place. Now in Phase 4 at 4 USDT, it remains one of the few retail-accessible opportunities in the current market cycle that resembles the conditions that built the first generation of crypto wealth.

2025-05-22T13:20:04.000Z,"Whale Makes Waves: $1.1B Bitcoin Long Shocks Hyperliquid Community","A whale recently took out a $1.1 billion leveraged long position on Bitcoin via the decentralized exchange (DEX) Hyperliquid. The enormous trade, reportedly made with 40x leverage, is believed to be the first time a position has crossed the billion-dollar threshold on the platform. The trader behind the audacious bet is believed to be “James Wynn,” a self-proclaimed high-risk leverage trader and memecoin enthusiast. According to on-chain data from Hypurrscan, Wynn used $28.4 million in margin to gradually build his position across multiple trades, with an average Bitcoin entry price of $108,065. At one point, the position was down by over $16 million before swinging into profit as Bitcoin surged past $110,000 on May 21 . The current liquidation price sits at $103,790 — a safe distance from the market’s current levels. “Absolute Mad Man” on Hyperliquid? The crypto community has been captivated by Wynn’s billion-dollar gamble. Reactions poured in on social media, with many praising the trader’s boldness. “He did it fellas. First position [on Hyperliquid] to exceed $1B,” said analyst Sigma^2. Others, like influencer Follis, remarked , “That mfer has nerves of steel.” While some were impressed, others questioned the wisdom of such a highly leveraged move in a notoriously volatile market. Still, Wynn seems to be reaping the rewards — and attention — as Bitcoin continues to rally. Data from HyperDash shows the whale began reducing parts of the position around the $106,000 mark on May 20, potentially locking in partial gains ahead of Bitcoin’s recent breakout. Who Is James Wynn? Little is known about Wynn beyond his digital footprint. He claims to have called the memecoin Pepe as a buy when its market cap was just $600,000 and refers to himself as a memecoin maximalist. Hypurrscan records show he began using Hyperliquid roughly two months ago, initially depositing $4.65 million worth of USDC. Since then, Wynn has made 32 trades, ranging from major tokens like XRP and Toncoin to highly speculative assets like Fartcoin and the “Official Trump” token. Hyperliquid — a rising DEX built on its own layer 1 blockchain — offers spot trading and DeFi lending, but this trade has cemented it in history as the scene of the largest known leveraged crypto position on-chain.

2025-05-22T13:19:19.000Z,"These 4 memecoins can outperform Bitcoin this cycle","Key takeaways: Memecoins like Fartcoin, WIF, SPX6900, and Popcat are outperforming Bitcoin in the short term amid renewed crypto market euphoria. Bullish technical patterns signal more upside for top-performing memecoins. Popcat stands out with a potential 350% rally, while Fartcoin and WIF also eye significant gains in the coming weeks. Bitcoin ( BTC ) has surged 7.35% over the past three days, hitting a new all-time high near $112,000 on May 22, but memecoins are stealing the spotlight. Fueled by BTC’s rally, several high-risk tokens are posting even larger gains, stoking possibilities that they could continue to outperform Bitcoin as the crypto bull run accelerates. Fartcoin ascending channel hints at more gains Solana-based Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) memecoin has surged 30% in the last three days to hit $1.57 as of May 22, its highest level in the last four months. The rally extends Fartcoin’s strong year-to-date (YTD) performance—up 74.50%—amid the ongoing memecoin frenzy . In comparison, Bitcoin has risen 18% so far in 2025. Technically, Fartcoin is trading within a well-defined ascending channel that began forming in early March, suggesting sustained bullish momentum. FARTCOIN/USDT daily price chart. Source: TradingView The memecoin has also broken above its 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA; the red wave), currently near $1.06, a key support level in uptrends. FARTCOIN’s relative strength index ( RSI ) was hovering near 64 as of May 22, suggesting there is room to run before selling conditions emerge near the overbought threshold at 70. If the uptrend holds, Fartcoin could retest the channel’s upper boundary near $2.74 by June, up 80% from the current price levels. Dogwifhat price could double Like FARTCOIN, Dogwifhat ( WIF ) has outperformed Bitcoin during the recent rally, up over 27% in the past three days. But the Solana memecoin has underperformed the top cryptocurrency year-to-date, down about 38%. But a bull pennant formation may put Dogwifhat in a position to catch up in the coming weeks. As of May 22, WIF’s price was testing the pennant’s upper trendline for a breakout, with its technical target at around $2.50, up about 125% from the current price levels. WIF/USDT daily price chart. Source: TradingView The upside target aligns with the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement line, which has served as resistance during WIF’s consolidation phase between November 2024 and January 2025. SPX6900 eyes 50% gains following breakout Ethereum-based SPX6900 (SPX6900) has surged 35% in the last three days, paring its 2025 losses. It is, therefore, underperforming Bitcoin on a YTD timeframe but, like WIF, shows the potential of outperforming BTC this cycle in percentage terms. At the core of this bullish outlook is SPX6900’s ongoing bullish reversal attempts. As of May 22, the memecoin had entered the breakout stage of its prevailing ascending triangle pattern, eyeing a rally toward $1.34 by June. SPX6900/USDT daily price chart. Source: TradingView The upside target is up 50% from the current price levels, which was the resistance in January. Popcat preps 350% rally setup Solana’s Popcat ( POPCAT ) gained 30% during Bitcoin’s rally, reaching its record high, but it remains an underperformer YTD. Related: Bitcoin 'looks exhausted' as next bear market yields $69K target However, a convincing cup-and-handle formation on POPCAT’s daily chart increases its potential of outperforming Bitcoin in the coming weeks or months.

When you do, you don’t own enough NFT’s, as art is upstream of wealth. Both will never be this cheap again,” Pal said.NFTs are “the single best long term store of wealth I know and you get to buy it before network effects kick in,” he added in another response.Source: Raoul Pal“There is some validity to the statement that NFTs, and in extension art, become a vehicle for the wealthy once a certain level of wealth is reached,” wrote Nicolai Sondergaard, research analyst at Nansen, calling it a “natural move” for asset diversification.“For traders and investors, further down the wealth curve, NFTs are partially about speculating on future returns,” he told Cointelegraph, adding that NFTs also benefit from the allure of strong communities, beyond just wealth creation.Related: German gov’t missed out on $2.3B profit after selling Bitcoin at $57KArt NFTs may see a resurgence as “digital ownership gains acceptance among younger, tech-savvy cohorts,” if collections manage to move past the “speculative fervor,” according to Anndy Lian, author and intergovernmental blockchain expert.Still, Lian said broader adoption depends on blockchain networks improving scalability and security to “instill confidence.” He added that art NFTs “must transcend hype, anchoring value in cultural significance or utility.”  Beeple’s “Everydays: The First 5000 Days.” Source: ChristiesSome digital artists made millions of dollars through NFTs.

2025-05-22T13:30:00.000Z,"How staking incentivizes trust without burning energy","What if a financial system could run itself not by burning electricity, but by rewarding good behavior? That’s the promise of staking, a mechanism that powers many modern blockchains by turning users into network operators. In this week’s episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Gareth Jenkinson and Nathan Jeffay sit down with StarkWare’s Noam Nisan to unpack how this trustless engine works, why it matters and what’s really at stake.Understanding stakingJeffay began by highlighting how staking is part of the backbone that keeps the blockchain running, and runs itself, with volunteers.“By doing this, they’re saying, OK, we’re taking this task of running the blockchain seriously. Here's some of our money. We're putting it down. We're showing that we're serious about doing this.”To help unpack this topic further and examine the deeper mechanics behind staking, the hosts are joined by Noam Nisan, principal researcher at StarkWare and a widely respected computer scientist who has held roles at Google and Princeton.Related: How to handle crypto trading gains and losses on your balance sheet“So we have this general system with operators... Why would they want to do that? The system, the protocol, incentivizes them to actually run the system,” Nisan explained. “Basically, it can give them tokens for operating the system.”Staking offers what Nisan describes as two distinct types of security: computer science-based guarantees and economic disincentives for bad actors. “If a majority or supermajority, maybe two-thirds of the parties of the token of the staked amount are behaving properly... we can prove that the system acts correctly,” he said. “But you also have what I would call an economic guarantee... if they destroy the system, very likely the value of the token... will go down. So they are the one losing.”PoW vs PoSJenkinson, a vocal Bitcoin (BTC) supporter, posed the classic comparison: proof-of-work vs proof-of-stake. “Do you have any strong feelings about one or the other?” he asked.“The truth is that it’s not clear.. it's really a social question, I think.”Nisan noted that both mechanisms involve trade-offs around cost, control, and decentralization. The episode also explores the role of staking in tokenomics and system design. Nisan unpacks how fee mechanics and inflation controls, such as Ethereum’s minting curve, help keep the ecosystem in balance.To hear the full conversation on The Clear Crypto Podcast,  listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

2025-05-22T12:38:44.000Z,"UK court partially dismisses Bitcoin SV investor’s lawsuit against Binance","The United Kingdom’s Court of Appeal has partially dismissed a lawsuit brought by Bitcoin SV investors against major crypto exchanges, including Binance, for allegedly conspiring to delist the token in 2019.In a judgment handed down on May 21, the court ruled that investors who held BSV through the delisting period (classified as “sub-class B”) were not entitled to billions in speculative damages based on BSV’s hypothetical growth.These investors had claimed over 8.9 billion British pounds ($11.9 billion) in damages, asserting that Binance’s delisting deprived holders of the chance to profit from BSV’s potential rise to a “top-tier cryptocurrency” like Bitcoin (BTC) or Bitcoin Cash (BCH).The court rejected this “foregone growth effect” theory, stating, “BSV was obviously not a unique cryptocurrency without reasonably similar substitutes,” pointing to the representative’s own use of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash as comparators.Sub-class B’s central claim was that delisting led to a missed opportunity to benefit from price appreciation. However, the court determined that those investors had ample chance to mitigate losses by selling or reinvesting in other crypto assets.“They had a duty to mitigate their losses,” wrote Master of the Rolls Sir Geoffrey Vos. “They cannot recover losses that they could reasonably have mitigated.”UK court ruling against Bitcoin SV investor’s lawsuit.

The court ruled it “flawed as a matter of principle,” noting that “cryptocurrencies are, by their nature, volatile investments.”Binance’s limited strike-out application ultimately succeeded, with the court stating that even if some holders were unaware of the delisting, “they could never claim more than the total value of their holding before the delisting events plus any quantifiable consequential losses.”Related: Binance wants arbitration for all members of securities class suitBinance seeks to dismiss FTX lawsuitOn May 16, Binance filed a motion to dismiss a $1.76 billion lawsuit filed by the FTX estate, arguing that the claims are legally flawed and an attempt to shift responsibility for FTX’s collapse.The exchange stated the downfall of FTX stemmed from internal fraud, not external manipulation, citing Sam Bankman-Fried’s conviction on multiple fraud charges.Binance has asked the court to dismiss all claims with prejudice.

2025-05-22T10:21:18.000Z,"Can ChatGPT-powered AI agents really trade crypto for you?","Key takeawaysChatGPT-powered AI agents automate trading tasks using natural language prompts and API integrations, improving speed and consistency.Successes occur when ChatGPT is used as a support tool, not a fully autonomous trading system.Failures happen when traders over-rely on ChatGPT without real-time data, proper risk management or manual oversight.Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance.What if a crypto trader didn’t need to constantly check charts, worry about emotions, or stay up all night watching for sudden price swings? What if those tasks could be handled by an intelligent agent that understands instructions in plain English — and reacts within milliseconds? That’s where ChatGPT-powered AI agents come in.These tools combine natural language processing with real-time trading logic to automate decision-making in one of the world’s most volatile markets. From rebalancing portfolios to reacting to market sentiment, ChatGPT is being adapted to act as a trading assistant, risk manager and market analyst — all rolled into one. But can it truly match or even outperform human intuition? This article explores how far these agents have come, where they shine and where they still fall short.How ChatGPT-powered AI agents operate in cryptocurrency marketsChatGPT-powered AI agents are changing how people interact with crypto markets. These tools combine ChatGPT’s language abilities with external trading tools and APIs to help users monitor prices, understand trends and even place trades automatically. Instead of just reacting to charts or numbers, ChatGPT can understand plain language commands like “Buy Ethereum if the price drops below $2,000” or “Sell Bitcoin if RSI goes above 70.”These AI trading assistants can work with major platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, OKX and other centralized or decentralized exchanges and can also tap into decentralized finance (DeFi) tools and smart contracts. With the right setup, ChatGPT can help automate trading strategies based on both technical data and market news.Success stories vs. failures in ChatGPT-powered crypto tradingSome traders have used ChatGPT to assist in automating parts of their crypto trading processes, particularly for strategy generation and sentiment analysis. For example, a user shared on Reddit that they used a ChatGPT-based AI agent for technical analysis on Ether (ETH), feeding it four-hour and daily chart screenshots. By interpreting market sentiment, support and resistance zones, and other indicators, they managed to make $6,500 in profits.Similarly, in the broader crypto sector, ChatGPT has been applied to support project development activities such as drafting white papers and marketing content. A notable example is the launch of the “TURBO” memecoin, which reportedly reached a market capitalization of over $50 million in 2024. In this case, ChatGPT was used to streamline documentation and communication rather than manage trading activity, illustrating its usefulness as a support tool in crypto-related initiatives.However, limitations are evident when ChatGPT is applied beyond its core design. While ChatGPT could suggest a trading portfolio and explain its reasoning clearly, it lacks access to real-time market data and couldn’t respond to sudden volatility. In one instance, ChatGPT was allocated $100 across multiple tokens but failed to actively manage the portfolio as prices fluctuated. This resulted in missed opportunities and underperformance compared to dynamic algorithmic strategies.Individual experiences reinforce these observations. A Redditor exposed a scam where a YouTuber promoted a “ChatGPT trading bot” tutorial that led users to deploy malicious smart contracts. The contracts, generated using ChatGPT and passed off as safe, were designed to drain user wallets once funded. Victims collectively lost $17,240 in ETH, highlighting the danger of blindly trusting AI-generated code without proper auditing.Even when asked, “If I use ChatGPT to build an AI agent for crypto trading, can I become a millionaire?” ChatGPT responded with a realistic outlook — acknowledging that while it’s possible, success depends on having a profitable strategy, disciplined risk management, and the ability to scale effectively.Here is ChatGPT’s response:These cases suggest that while ChatGPT can support certain elements of the trading process, it should not be treated as a standalone solution for autonomous crypto trading.AI in crypto trading: Key benefits and limitationsAI tools like ChatGPT are increasingly being integrated into crypto trading workflows to improve speed, accuracy and efficiency. While they offer important advantages, they also carry specific limitations that traders must actively manage. Below are the main benefits and challenges:Key benefits of using AI for crypto tradingAI bots can execute trades in milliseconds, crucial for capturing opportunities in fast-moving crypto markets.Bots follow pre-programmed rules precisely, eliminating emotional biases that often affect human traders.Crypto markets are always open, and AI bots can monitor and act around the clock without interruption.A single bot can manage multiple trading pairs, exchanges and strategies simultaneously.ChatGPT can understand specific prompts like “Rebalance every Monday” or “Set stop-loss at 5%,” allowing flexible automation.Limitations of ChatGPT in cryptocurrency tradingChatGPT does not access live market data unless specifically integrated with external APIs (e.g., TradingView, CoinMarketCap or exchange websockets).Instructions must be clear and unambiguous; ChatGPT may misinterpret vague or complex commands.Improperly secured API keys or lack of two-factor authentication (2FA) can expose trading accounts to unauthorized access.ChatGPT’s cloud-based infrastructure can introduce latency, which could impact performance during highly volatile periods.ChatGPT does not monitor regional compliance rules; users must manually enforce trading limits based on local regulations.Ethical and regulatory implications of AI in crypto tradingAs AI becomes more integrated into trading systems, it raises significant ethical and regulatory concerns that stakeholders across the financial sector are beginning to address.Accountability: If an AI agent executes a harmful or unlawful trade, questions arise around legal responsibility. It remains unclear in many jurisdictions whether liability falls primarily on the developer, the trader using the AI system or the platform facilitating the transactions.Market manipulation risks: Autonomous AI bots could unintentionally engage in activities such as spoofing (placing and canceling fake orders to mislead the market) or wash trading (creating artificial volume), especially if not properly programmed with compliance safeguards.Regulatory oversight: Financial authorities, including the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the European Securities and Markets Authority, are actively studying the implications of AI and algorithmic trading. These agencies have recognized that traditional trading regulations may not fully account for autonomous decision-making by AI systems.Policy developments: In January 2024, the European Commission released updates to its Digital Finance Strategy, which included references to AI-based financial services. While not yet finalized, these draft regulations under the broader Digital Finance Package signal a move toward stricter compliance expectations for firms deploying AI in financial markets.Meanwhile, ethical crypto platforms are beginning to voluntarily disclose the use of trading bots in their systems. In parallel, open-source communities are advocating for clearer audit trails, improved model transparency and the establishment of ethical guidelines for AI applications in finance to ensure accountability and fairness.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Now I apologize for the next video not having audio due to a technical issue being looked into, but I am sure most of you with a will, will find a way, and see why.</p><p>Now you will note in the chart within the video, also shown below, that we have that little grey line for an expected price level of liquadation at $115,500. I explain what this means further below.</p><p>Understanding Liquidation Levels and How They Influence Bitcoin Price Forecast</p><p>For Bitcoin traders and investors, understanding liquidation levels—especially those linked to large positions—is crucial. Liquidations can dramatically influence short-term price movements, triggering swift and often volatile market reactions.</p><p>What Does 'Liquidation' Actually Mean?</p><p>In cryptocurrency futures trading, liquidation occurs when a trader's leveraged position is closed automatically by the exchange because the position's margin is no longer sufficient to cover potential losses. Traders holding leveraged long positions (expecting price to rise) will face liquidation if the price moves significantly lower. Conversely, leveraged short positions (expecting prices to drop) face liquidation if prices rise significantly.</p><p>What Is 'Cumulative Short Liquidation Leverage'?</p><p>The \""cumulative short liquidation leverage\"" refers to the total amount of short positions that could be forcibly closed if Bitcoin's price hits a certain level. When the price approaches these liquidation points, shorts become at risk of being liquidated, forcing these traders to buy Bitcoin at market prices to cover their positions. This forced buying adds upward pressure on prices, often triggering even higher spikes.</p><p>Why Bitcoin Traders (and Investors) Should Care</p><p>These liquidation levels act as magnets or significant pivot points in price action. Let's consider two critical liquidation zones for Bitcoin based on recent data:</p><ul><li><p>Above Current Price: At around $115,549, approximately 3.75k BTC worth of short positions could be liquidated. This forced buying could push prices rapidly higher, creating momentum that attracts additional buyers.</p></li><li><p>Below Current Price: A notable zone between approximately $96,000 and $97,335 shows significant potential liquidations of leveraged long positions. If Bitcoin prices drop into this range, substantial selling could be triggered, rapidly pushing prices lower.</p></li></ul><p>How Liquidations Can Propel BTC Futures Price Further</p><p>When a large liquidation occurs (let's say short liquidation at a higher price), traders holding shorts must rapidly buy Bitcoin at the market price to cover their positions. This buying activity creates immediate upward pressure, potentially triggering additional liquidations of other short sellers, causing prices to spike even higher.</p><p>Moreover, these rapid price movements attract momentum traders, scalpers, and short-term speculators who ride the trend further upwards. However, caution is necessary: significant liquidation points often become attractive levels for larger, savvy traders to take profits. Thus, it's common to witness price spiking above critical liquidation levels, followed by a reversal or at least a retest of previously broken resistance or support.</p><p>Key Trading Guidance for Bitcoin Traders</p><ul><li><p>Do Not Treat Liquidation Levels as Precise Reversal Points: Instead, anticipate potential overshoots. Price often moves beyond these levels due to the aggressive market orders and new entrants drawn by the momentum.</p></li><li><p>Expect Potential Reversals Post-Liquidation Spikes: Often, sharp moves above resistance (or below support) are temporary, leading to a reversal as profit-takers seek new buyers or sellers entering at extreme prices.</p></li><li><p>Stay Alert to Retests: After a liquidation-driven breakout, watch carefully if prices return to test the previously significant level—often a key indicator of the next market direction.</p></li></ul><p>Why Track Whales Specifically?</p><p>While standard liquidation maps provide helpful insights, focusing on whale or large institutional positions offers enhanced predictive value. Large traders typically hold sizable positions with significant market impact. Their liquidation points, therefore, are more likely to trigger noticeable price movements, setting off cascades of secondary liquidations and momentum-driven trades. By tracking these larger positions, traders gain clearer insights into potentially explosive market dynamics and critical price thresholds.</p><p>In summary, understanding liquidation dynamics, especially those involving significant \""whale\"" positions, gives Bitcoin traders a vital edge. Remain vigilant around key liquidation zones, anticipate temporary volatility spikes, and prepare for potential reversals and retests. Trade wisely, understanding that these are guides—not guarantees—of price action.</p><p>Bitcoin Price Outlook</p><p>My current analysis indicates a target range of $117,000 - $119,000 for Bitcoin futures.</p><p>Please note that the above video contains visual information only, as a technical issue is currently being addressed which impacts the audio.

2025-05-22T08:37:57.000Z,"Dubai regulator clarifies real-world asset tokenization rules: Lawyer","Newly updated guidelines from Dubai’s crypto regulator include provisions on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and clarify rules for issuers. On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) released its updated Rulebook for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) operating in the region. The regulator gave market participants until June 19 to comply with the new rules. The regulator previously told Cointelegraph that it had enhanced supervisory mechanisms and brought consistency across activity-based rules. One of the more prominent changes includes regulatory clarity on RWA tokens. Irina Heaver, partner at the United Arab Emirates-based law firm NeosLegal, told Cointelegraph that the updated rules clarify RWA issuance and distribution. “Issuing real-world asset tokens and listing them on secondary markets is no longer theoretical,” Heaver told Cointelegraph. “It’s now a regulatory reality in Dubai and the broader UAE.”A “viable” path to realize RWA hypeHeaver compared RWAs to security token offerings (STOs), an earlier attempt from the crypto space to tokenize securities like stocks, bonds and real estate investment trusts. However, the UAE crypto lawyer said that STOs “died a peaceful death in 2018 to 2019.” The lawyer told Cointelegraph STOs did not work out because of the lack of regulatory clarity, viable secondary market trading venues, institutional investor appetite and liquidity. Still, the situation is different for RWAs. Heaver told Cointelegraph that RWAs are the next foundational layer for institutional adoption of blockchain and virtual assets. Heaver said that VARA’s new rules already cover them as Asset-Referenced Virtual Assets (ARVA) tokens. She said: “VARA’s newly updated Virtual Asset Issuance Rulebook (May 2025) addresses these failures head-on. Regulated exchanges and broker-dealers in Dubai are now authorized to distribute and list ARVA tokens.”The lawyer said this solves an issue in jurisdictions like Switzerland, where token issuance is possible, but listing and secondary trading remain unregulated. Related: Dubai gov’t agencies to link real estate registry with property tokenizationLawyer shares requirements for RWA issuersHeaver said ARVA tokens are defined under Dubai law as representing direct or indirect ownership of real-world assets, granting entitlement to receive or share income and purporting to maintain a stable value by reference to real-world assets or income. ARVA tokens are also backed or collateralised by such real-world assets or constitute a derivative, wrapped, duplicated, or fractionalised version of another ARVA. The lawyer said issuers must meet specific requirements, including a Category 1 Virtual Asset Issuance license, a comprehensive white paper and a risk disclosure statement. In addition, issuers must have a paid-up capital of 1.5 million UAE dirhams (about $408,000) or 2% of reserve assets held. The issuers are also subjected to monthly independent audit obligations and must adhere to ongoing supervisory oversight. “VARA is providing regulatory clarity, and it’s giving the industry a viable, enforceable path to turn the hype of RWA tokenization into reality,” Heaver told Cointelegraph. “This matters because it marks a shift, from theory to execution, from fiction to framework.”Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/dubai-vara-guidelines-rwa-tokenization-clarity?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-22T08:25:00.000Z,"5 red flags you’re being shilled: Don’t buy the hype","What is shilling in crypto?              At its core, shilling is the act of artificially promoting a cryptocurrency or token, often with exaggerated claims, to increase its price or popularity. But what’s the goal? Hype it up, get others to buy in, and then cash out, leaving latecomers holding the bag.Shilling can come from anyone: influencers, anonymous accounts or even high-profile figures with political or financial clout. The common thread is manipulation: It’s not about educating you or building real value but pumping hype for personal gain.Unfortunately, the line between enthusiastic promotion and outright deception can be thin, and many fall victim without realizing it. That’s why it’s critical to learn how to spot the signs early.                  5 red flags you’re being shilled              Beware of crypto red flags like overhyped promises, anonymous teams, influencer shills, missing products and FOMO tactics — if it smells like a scam, it probably is.1. Overhyped promises You’ve probably seen posts that scream:“100x potential!”“Guaranteed returns!”“This is your ticket to financial freedom!”These are classic shill tactics. Real, credible projects don’t promise life-changing profits. Why? Because there are no guarantees in crypto or in any investment.When a project leads with grandiose financial claims rather than actual product value or utility, it’s likely a ploy to stir FOMO and attract unsuspecting investors. The truth is, if something sounds too good to be true, it almost always is.Remember: The bigger the promise, the bigger the red flag.2. Anonymous or suspicious teams In crypto, anonymity isn’t always bad, but when you’re trusting people with your money, transparency matters.It’s a major red flag when a project has:No identifiable team membersFake names or aliasesStock photos on its websiteNo LinkedIn or professional history.The simple rule is “No face, no funds.”Scammers often hide behind anonymity because they know they’ll eventually vanish and there’ll be no one to hold accountable. Even worse, some use fabricated credentials or hire actors to pose as team members.Before investing, check whether the founders or developers have any verifiable history. Do they have prior experience in blockchain or startups? Have they launched anything successful before?3. Influencer spam and paid promotions One day, no one’s talking about a particular coin — the next, your feed is flooded with influencers hyping it up. Sound familiar?This sudden burst of attention is often coordinated with a paid promotion campaign disguised as “genuine enthusiasm.”Many influencers fail to disclose sponsorships, even though it’s required by law in many countries. The US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have cracked down on this in recent years.Take, for example:Kim Kardashian, who was fined $1.26 million in 2022 for promoting EthereumMax without proper disclosure.Floyd Mayweather Jr., who was sued for endorsing the same project at a paid event.BitBoy (Ben Armstrong), who faced legal action in multiple lawsuits for promoting scam tokens to his audience.If you notice multiple influencers promoting the same project in a short time, especially without using labels like #ad or #sponsored, it’s a strong indicator of a shill campaign.Don’t mistake volume for value. Hype doesn’t equal legitimacy.4. No real product or roadmapIf you visit the project’s website, it looks sleek, maybe even impressive. But where’s the product? Where’s the code?Shilled tokens often rely on flashy marketing but have no working application, no GitHub code and no actual use case. Everything is either “coming soon” or buried behind vague promises.Ask yourself:Can I use the platform or app today?Is there a white paper that makes sense?Do they have public repositories or open development?If all you’re seeing is a landing page and a vague roadmap that’s been “coming soon” for months, that’s a major red flag.5. Pressure tactics and FOMO Time pressure is a psychological weapon, and shillers know how to use it.Watch out for lines such as:“Presale ends in 2 hours!”“Only 1,000 spots left!”“If you don’t buy now, you’ll miss out forever!”These tactics prey on your fear of missing out (FOMO) and push you into making impulsive decisions without research.But crypto isn’t a sprint; it’s a long-term game. Anyone trying to rush you into buying likely has something to hide. Solid investments don’t need fake urgency.Take a breath, step back, and ask yourself: Am I buying because I believe in this project or because I’m being manipulated?Did you know? The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) secured a $128-million judgment against Ryan Mitchell Pope, Daniel Samuel Bishop and their company EmpiresX for operating a fraudulent forex and cryptocurrency investment scheme that defrauded over 12,500 victims.                  Is shilling illegal in crypto? Can influencers be sued?              Shilling isn’t just unethical in many cases — it’s also illegal.In the world of crypto, undisclosed promotions are a major legal risk. If someone is paid to promote a token or project but fails to reveal that financial connection, they could face fines, lawsuits or even criminal charges. This is especially true if the promoted token is later classified as a security under US law.Regulators like the SEC, FTC and CFTC have all cracked down on this behavior. Their targets have included:Influencers who failed to disclose paid promotionsPromoters who misled investors with false claimsIndividuals who ran pump-and-dump schemes using social media.Francier Obando Pinillo, a pastor from Miami, was indicted on 26 fraud counts for running a crypto scam through “Solano Fi,” defrauding investors of millions from 2021 to 2023. He allegedly used his church, social media and false promises of 34.9% monthly returns to lure victims. The platform showed fake gains but blocked withdrawals, while funds were diverted for personal use. Pinillo was arraigned in Richland, Washington and faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.As crypto becomes more mainstream, expect stricter regulations and more consequences for shillers.Did you know? Argentine President Javier Milei has dissolved the special task force investigating the LIBRA cryptocurrency scandal, a project he promoted in February 2025 that surged to a $4.5-billion valuation before crashing by over 97%. The task force, created by Milei himself, was disbanded via Decree 332/2025, citing that it had fulfilled its purpose. However, critics argue that no official findings were released, and judicial investigations into Milei and his associates continue.                  How to protect yourself from shilling scams              Do your own research, verify the team and utility, ignore hype and influencers, and stay alert to pump-and-dump schemes to avoid crypto shilling traps.Let’s understand how you can protect yourself from shilling scams in crypto:Do your own research (DYOR): Always research the project, the team behind it and the data supporting the claims. Don’t rely solely on hype or influencer recommendations. Look into onchain data, GitHub activity and the project’s utility to make informed decisions.Verify the team: A legitimate crypto project should have a transparent and credible team. If the developers are anonymous or have no professional profiles (like LinkedIn), that’s a red flag. Always check the team’s past projects and credibility before investing.Look for real utility: Does this project actually solve a problem? A genuine project should have a working product or solution, not just promises. Avoid projects that lack real-world utility or are still in “coming soon” stages for extended periods.Ignore the hype: If a token is suddenly trending on social media or being aggressively promoted, don’t let FOMO influence your judgment. Shillers often rely on emotions to push their agenda, so it’s essential to evaluate projects based on their merits, not just popularity.Stay skeptical of influencers: Influencers with large followings may be paid to promote certain tokens. Before taking their advice, ask yourself, What’s their incentive? Verify the promotion is legitimate and disclosed as paid or sponsored. Always cross-check the information with independent sources.Watch for pump-and-dump schemes: Be cautious of sudden price spikes followed by rapid drops. These are often signs of pump-and-dump schemes where the token’s value is artificially inflated by coordinated buying and then quickly sold off, leaving investors with losses. Always monitor price trends and be wary of sudden, unexplained increases in value.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/5-red-flags-youre-being-shilled-dont-buy-the-hype?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Seeker is the company’s second-generation device, after the Saga Web3 phone that launched in April 2023. The company unveiled the Seeker phone in September 2024, saying it wouldn’t just be a “memecoin phone.” So far, it has pre-sold 150,000 units.The Solana Seeker has gone through two sale phases: The Founder window, where the price for each device was $450, and the Early Adopter window, where the price per device was $500. Assuming the lower price window, Solana Mobile could generate at least $67.5 million in gross revenue from device sales. For comparison, the iPhone generated $199.3 billion in revenue for Apple in 2024.The new architecture that will govern future Solana Mobile devices is called TEEPIN, which stands for “Trusted Execution Environment Platform Infrastructure Network.” It is a three-layer architecture — hardware, platform, and network layers — that will allow users, developers, and device makers to participate in a trustless environment.Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder and CEO of Solana Labs, called TEEPIN “the next evolution in mobile” and a framework where trust is “verified by cryptography.”In addition, Solana Mobile is planning to launch “SKR,” the native asset of the Solana Mobile ecosystem. \""It transforms the traditional mobile business model by giving stakeholders actual ownership in the platform,” said Emmett Hollyer, general manager at Solana Mobile.

This data supports the idea that derivatives markets were not the main driver of the recent price increases. Moreover, the $1.37 billion in net inflows to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States between May 15 and May 20 further suggests that spot buyers, rather than derivatives traders, were the primary force behind the rally.Despite the lack of conviction in Bitcoin futures, several indicators point to further upside. Forced liquidations of bearish BTC futures positions were relatively low at $170 million between May 18 and May 21, cementing the idea of a spot-driven rally. In comparison, the rally to $104,000 on May 9 triggered $538 million in liquidations over three days.Related: Is Bitcoin price close to a cycle top? — 5 indicators that help traders decideBitcoin options put-to-call ratio at Deribit.

Still, the potential for the price to reach $110,000 and higher is partly based on the weak position of the US Federal Reserve. Injecting liquidity could ease recession concerns, but it also reduces the appeal of government bonds, which favors risk-on assets like Bitcoin.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The ETH/USDT pair is likely to pick up momentum on a break above $2,739. That clears the path for a rally to $3,000.Contrary to this assumption, a break and close below the 20-day EMA signals that the bears are back in the game. The pair could tumble to $2,111, which is likely to attract solid buying by the bulls.XRP price predictionXRP (XRP) has been witnessing a tough battle between the buyers and sellers at the 20-day EMA ($2.35).XRP/USDT daily chart.

If the price skids below the 20-day EMA, the XRP/USDT pair may stay inside the $2 to $2.65 range for a while. Instead, if the price turns up sharply from the 20-day EMA and breaks above $2.65, the advantage will tilt in favor of the bulls. The pair could rally to $3 and, after that, to $3.40, where the sellers are expected to mount a strong defense.BNB price predictionBNB (BNB) bulls have held the 20-day EMA ($639) support during the pullback, indicating buying on dips. BNB/USDT daily chart.

2025-05-21T17:55:00.000Z,"Interest groups, lawmakers to protest Trump&#039;s memecoin dinner","Democratic leaning organizations and members of Congress have announced plans to protest what they describe as the sale of access to the office of the US president, in reference to Donald Trump’s memecoin dinner on May 22. The event’s attendees are said to have collectively spent over $100 million for the chance to meet with the US president.Since Trump’s memecoin project, Official Trump (TRUMP), announced that its top 220 tokenholders would have an opportunity to apply for an exclusive dinner with the president, many leaders in the crypto industry and US lawmakers have criticized the event, saying Trump was opening his office to potential bribery and corruption. The memecoin dinner prompted some Democratic lawmakers to withdraw support for crypto-related legislation in Congress, including the market structure and stablecoin bills.“Trump collecting gifts from foreign governments is unconstitutional,” a spokesperson for the consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen, which is planning to protest near the memecoin dinner on May 22, told Cointelegraph. “Collecting foreign government investments through his memecoin is not much better. American foreign policy should not be for sale.”Source: Public CitizenCrypto industry figures such as Tron founder Justin Sun, Kronos Research chief investment officer Vincent Liu, Hyperithm co-CEO Oh Sangrok, and Synthetix founder Kain Warwick are among the tokenholders expected to attend the dinner at the Trump National Golf Club outside Washington, DC. The memecoin project said all applicants had to pass a background check and could not be from a “[Know Your Customer] watchlist country.”Related: Democrats seek suspicious activity reports linked to Trump crypto venturesPublic Citizen, in partnership with progressive political organization Our Revolution, will hold a rally near the golf club, which Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley is expected to attend. In addition, the Arlington and Loudoun Democrats will be hosting a separate event to urge US officials to “hold [Trump] accountable,” and Democratic leadership in Congress has scheduled two press events on May 22 ahead of the dinner.“Americans cannot and will not accept President Trump’s view that positions of power exist only to benefit the holder of that power,” Ryan Ruzic, chair of the Loudoun County Democratic Committee, told Cointelegraph. “We have a moral responsibility to speak out against corruption, whatever the result may be.”Pushback on TRUMP memecoin affected crypto legislationSome lawmakers initially cited the memecoin dinner and the Trump family’s involvement with the crypto platform World Liberty Financial in opposing passage of the GENIUS Act, a bill to regulate payment stablecoins. World Liberty Financial began issuing its own USD1 stablecoin in March, prompting concerns about Trump’s conflicts of interest. However, the legislation passed a key procedural vote in the Senate on May 19 with support from Democrats, setting the bill up for debate in the chamber.“Many senators, myself included, have very real concerns about the Trump family’s use of crypto technologies to evade oversight, hide shady financial dealings, and personally profit at the expense of everyday Americans,” said Sen. Mark Warner in a statement before the May 19 vote, adding: “But we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay.”Senator Chris Murphy, who voted against advancing the GENIUS Act, called for bipartisan support in amending the bill to specifically bar a US president from issuing stablecoins. He also called on the White House to release a complete list of attendees to the memecoin dinner, suggesting that some or all of them would “try to get something from the president” in exchange for purchasing the tokens. Murphy and Senator Elizabeth Warren will attend a press event with representatives for Public Citizen on May 22. California Representative Maxine Waters, ranking member of the US House Financial Services Committee, announced a separate press conference for the same day, with plans to introduce a bill to “block Trump’s memecoin and stop his crypto corruption, once and for all.”As of May 21, the exact number of attendees to the dinner was unknown. A smaller group of 25 tokenholders also qualified to apply for “VIP tour” and reception — presumably at the White House — with Trump, but the complete list of those planning to attend was also unknown at the time of publication.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/protest-donald-trump-memecoin-dinner?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-21T17:02:48.000Z,"Is Bitcoin price close to a cycle top? — 5 indicators that help traders decide","Key takeaways:Bitcoin market cycle tops are notoriously hard to time, but combining technical and behavioral indicators can offer strong signals.The MVRV-Z Score, Pi Cycle Top indicator, trade volume trends, Puell Multiple, and exchange inflows accurately predict Bitcoin price cycle tops.Bitcoin (BTC) might be approaching the final stage of its current market cycle — a dramatic final rally followed by a sharp correction and, eventually, a bear market. For many, this could be the long-awaited climax of the past four years, and major players are preparing accordingly.Since late 2024, Bitcoin whale accumulation has surged. Glassnode data shows that the number of addresses holding over 100 BTC has jumped by almost 14%, reaching 18,200 — a level not seen since 2017. The biggest market players appear to be positioning for what could be this cycle’s final run-up.Number of BTC addresses holding over 100 BTC. Source: GlassnodeHowever, riding the rally is trickier than it looks and knowing when to exit is notoriously difficult. The lure of higher price highs fuels FOMO, driving investors to buy the top, only to face painful drawdowns or even liquidations.So, how can traders and investors spot the top before the market enters recession?Bitcoin cycle top markersSeveral technical and onchain indicators, such as MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Z-score, Pi Cycle Top, and trading volume trends, have historically been reliable in signaling when Bitcoin is nearing its peak.The MVRV-Z score compares Bitcoin’s market value to its realized value and adjusts for volatility. A high Z-score suggests Bitcoin is significantly overvalued relative to its historical cost basis. When this indicator is at a historical high, the ensuing downward trend in Bitcoin prices is likely.The Pi Cycle Top tracks BTC price dynamics using moving averages. When the 111-day moving average (111-SMA) crosses above twice the 350-day average (350-SMAx2), it signals overheating. In other words, when the short-term trend catches up to the long-term trajectory, a market top is in.Historically, all previous Bitcoin bull runs started with a notable surge in MVRV Z-score, and ended with 111-SMA crossing the longer-term trend.BTC: Pi Cycle Top + MVRV Z-score. Source: Marie Poteriaieva, GlassnodeAdditionally, lower trading volumes during price increases can be a warning sign, often signaling weakening momentum and potential for a reversal. On-balance volume (OBV), which registers cumulative volume flow, is a valuable metric for tracking this process. When OBV diverges from the price action, it is often an early reversal signal. The second leg of the 2021 bull run was a great example. While BTC price was hitting higher highs of $68,000 (compared to the previous all-time high of $63,170), trading volumes moved in a different direction, decreasing from 710,000 BTC to 628,000 BTC. This created a bearish divergence between price and volume, suggesting that fewer market participants were supporting the rally — a classic sign of waning momentum.BTC/USD 1-day, OBV.

Some valuable metrics that can track it are the Puell Multiple and exchange flows.The Puell Multiple Indicator looks at miners' revenue relative to its 365-day average. High readings indicate miners may start selling aggressively, and are often seen near market tops.Large inflows to exchanges are usually signs of distribution, as investors prepare to sell their coins. BTC total transfer volume to exchanges + Puell Multiple.

The curved parabolic trendline that’s supported the rally is broken — a clear signal that the top is likely in. Meanwhile, altcoins and meme tokens may continue pumping a little longer.Complacency. Measure 15% below Bitcoin’s all-time high. That’s the sell zone. Order books on major exchanges often show a wall of sell orders around this level — a likely institutional exit point.According to Garner, the 15% (or 16%) rule works not only in crypto but in traditional markets as well.Historical blow off-tops: BTC, ETH, gold, Nasdaq, Nikkei, Broadvision, 3D Systems.

In a May 21 social media post that begins with, “The Empire Lobbies Back,” Campbell claimed that the banking industry is especially alarmed by the potential for stablecoins to offer interest or rewards to holders. In a pointed message aimed at Democratic lawmakers, Campbell wrote that “banks want you to protect their cartel so they can keep screwing your voters.” He went on to explain how fractional reserve banking enables banks to maximize profits while offering depositors minimal interest.The banking lobby says that if stablecoins pay interest or any other type of monetary reward, banks will be “harmed,” Campbell added.An excerpt of Campbell’s X post.

In line with its current trajectory, 21st Capital co-founder Sina noted that Bitcoin is approaching a pivotal moment around the $108,000 level. The Bitcoin Quantile Model update shows that BTC’s market reflects the same “heat” that was present after President Trump’s post-election rally and the spot ETF-driven highs during Q4 2024. The model, which uses quantile regression to map Bitcoin’s price phases on a logarithmic scale, indicates the cryptocurrency is in the Transition Zone, a critical juncture before the Acceleration Phase. Throughout Q4, 2024, Bitcoin rallied by 45% after entering a price discovery period above $74,500. Bitcoin Quantile Model. Source: X.comAs illustrated in the chart, once it breaks into the \""Acceleration\"" Phase, it could trigger BTC’s next leg or the mid-phase, typically between the 33% and 66% range. Based on the model, BTC is expected to progressively target price levels of $130,000 and $163,000 in the coming months. However, anonymous Bitcoin analyst apsk32 believed a price target above $200,000 is a “reasonable” expectation for 2025. Basing the projection on Bitcoin’s “power curve,” the analyst noted that BTC’s position relative to gold has significantly improved since April. From a technical standpoint, this view is supported by the recent convergence of the Sharpe ratios for Bitcoin and gold, suggesting that the two hard assets now offer comparable risk-to-reward profiles to their investors. Fidelity’s Director of Global Macro Jurrien Timmer shed light on this development, recommending a 4:1 goal-to-Bitcoin ratio from an allocation perspective. Related: Bitcoin 'blow-off top' set at $128K with new all-time highs in sightStrong Bitcoin volumes “final straw” before new highs Crypto researcher Aylo analyzed BTC’s historical price action when the crypto asset consolidates near its all-time high level. In an X post, the analyst explained, “The data shows when BTC gets close to its previous ATH during a strong, accelerating trend with high momentum, it has historically broken out to new ATHs within a short time (days to weeks).”However, weaker trends have led to stalls or retraces between March and May 2024. Currently, Bitcoin exhibits a strong trend but lacks the necessary trading volume, which remains the final straw to confirm a breakout, a factor that could delay upward movement.Alyo added that for Bitcoin to break its all-time highs, daily trading volume should exceed the previous 10 days, be at least 1.5 times the 20-day average, and ideally sustain a 3-day increase while the price holds steady or rises.Data from CryptoQuant has reinforced Aylo’s concerns about trading volume. On May 21, retail investor demand for Bitcoin, defined as wallets buying/selling between $0 and $10,000, remained low at just 3.2% over 30 days, despite BTC trading within $2,000 of its all-time high.Bitcoin’s retail investor volumes.

This indicates fresh capital inflows into the market at higher prices. As Cointelegraph reported, holding above $2,400 was crucial to ensure a potential $3,000 retest.Ethereum: Key pricing levels.

This concentration suggests many investors may sell at break-even, potentially stalling Ether’s upward momentum.Ethereum cost basis distribution chart. Source: GlassnodeFrom a technical perspective, ETH must flip the $3,000 resistance level into support to target higher highs above $4,000.But first, the ETH/USD pair must close above the $2,600-$2,800 range, where the 100-day and 50-day simple moving averages (SMA) currently sit. ETH price dropped below this level in February, driven by risk-off sentiment following Trump’s tariff measures. ETH/USD weekly chart.

Ether ETFs registered $100.7 million in net inflows in the last three days, per Farside Investors’ data.Meanwhile, the bears will attempt to keep the $2,600 resistance in place to increase the likelihood of pulling the price lower. The immediate target is below the $2,400 level, or the 200-day SMA.Below $2,400, the next key area of interest remains between $2,200 and the psychological level at $2,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) set a new high of $109,400 on May 21, rising more than 26% in the past month, according to data from TradingView.

2025-05-21T15:00:00.000Z,"How to handle crypto trading gains and losses on your balance sheet","Key takeawaysProperly accounting for crypto assets on your balance sheet is essential for accurate tax reporting and financial transparency.Crypto trading activities should be recorded like stock trading, at fair market value on the day of purchase.In some countries, like the US, crypto losses can offset gains, so keeping track of gains and losses is important for reducing taxable income.Whether you’re an individual investor or a business, treating cryptocurrencies as assets and documenting them ensures compliance with tax laws and minimizes the risk of errors.Let’s be real, it’s easy to lose sight of what you’ve actually gained or lost, especially when it comes to crypto and its market volatility and frequent trading activities. And when it comes to accounting, especially in countries like the United States, it gets trickier because you must reflect those numbers properly on your balance sheet. If you are running a business that involves crypto or you are just a crypto investor, understanding how to account for your digital assets correctly is crucial. This guide breaks down the basics of balance sheets, handling crypto gains and losses, and what tax implications you need to account for.What is a balance sheet, and why is it needed?Think of a balance sheet as a report of your financial health. It shows what you own, owe and what’s left over at a specific point in time. It contains three main parts: Assets: What the company owns, such as cash, crypto, real estate, inventory, etc.Liabilities: What the company owes, such as loans, unpaid bills and taxesEquity: What’s left after subtracting liabilities from assets (net worth).For example, if you own $50,000 worth of crypto, and at the same time, you owe someone $20,000. In this case, your equity is $30,000. Balance sheets help you understand your financial position at a glance. They’re essential for filing taxes, attracting investors, applying for loans and complying with regulations. Balance sheets are essential in countries like the United States, where businesses must report crypto holdings accurately for tax and compliance reasons. Similarly, in the UK, European countries and Canada, balance sheets are important for businesses and are often used by individuals, especially when dealing with crypto assets. It’s not just for taxes. A well-maintained balance sheet can help you get funding, plan your finances, or simply sleep better knowing where you stand at night.How do you treat crypto on a balance sheet?One of the most common questions when preparing a balance sheet is, “How to report crypto trading gains and losses on a balance sheet?” In most jurisdictions, the crypto reporting and taxation rules are still to be decided or clarified. This also applies to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which lack definitive guidance concerning cryptocurrency accounting.As cryptocurrencies are considered assets in many jurisdictions, the fundamental concepts of accounting for assets could apply when preparing a balance sheet involving crypto transactions. Below is an example of a simplified crypto balance sheet treatment and some helpful pointers that may assist you in accounting for crypto trading in 2025.Notes to the balance sheet:Cash ($15,000): Represents fiat currency (e.g., USD) held in bank accounts or wallets, including proceeds from selling crypto or other revenue.Cryptocurrency ($20,000): Recorded at cost basis (fair market value at acquisition, less any impairment). Includes 0.5 Bitcoin (BTC) purchased at $30,000 each ($15,000 total) and 10 Ether (ETH) purchased at $500 each ($5,000 total). No impairment has been recorded, assuming the fair market value (FMV) remains above cost.Mining equipment ($5,000): Capitalized cost of crypto mining hardware, net of depreciation. The original cost was $8,000, with $3,000 accumulated depreciation over two years.Accounts payable ($2,000): Unpaid bills (e.g., for electricity or supplier services related to crypto mining operations).Taxes payable ($1,500): Estimated tax liability for realized crypto gains (e.g., from selling 0.1 BTC at a $2,000 gain, taxed at 20% long-term capital gains rate for simplicity).Retained earnings ($36,500): Accumulated profits, including crypto-related income (e.g., mining revenue, realized gains) minus expenses and taxes. Reflects net income from prior and current periods.When buying cryptocurrency with fiat moneyWhen you buy cryptocurrency with fiat money, such as dollars or euros, you’re simply exchanging one type of asset, such as cash, for another, like crypto or stocks. On your balance sheet, cryptocurrency trading activities should be recorded similarly to those of stock trading activities. As with stocks, you should record cryptocurrency on your balance sheet at its fair market value on the day of purchase. While your cash account displays a credit for the same amount, the cryptocurrency is recorded as a debit to your assets account.When selling cryptocurrency for fiat moneySelling crypto for fiat creates a change in your balance sheet: Your crypto holdings will be reduced, meaning credited, and your cash will increase, which also means that the account will be credited.If you sell for more than you paid (the original price of a token), you have a gain; if you sell for less, you record a loss. Both crypto gains and crypto losses should be tracked carefully for tax and reporting purposes.How to record crypto lossesThe difference is recorded as a loss when you sell crypto at a lower price than you bought it for. In some countries, these losses can lower your taxable income, so it can prove useful to properly document them.  However, even if the asset regains its previous price levels, impairment losses cannot be undone in accordance with GAAP’s accounting rules for intangible assets.This contrasts with IFRS, where certain intangible assets can be revalued upward under IAS 38 if an active market exists. However, crypto markets are volatile, and IFRS guidance on crypto revaluation remains unclear, so most entities stick to cost-less impairment. Businesses should consult local accounting standards and auditors for precise treatment.How to record crypto profitsIf you receive cryptocurrency as payment for goods, services or other activities, it’s treated as income at the fair market value on the date you receive it. This value is recorded as revenue and added to your assets. Later, if you sell or swap the crypto, any difference in value will result in a capital gain or loss.How to record crypto mining When cryptocurrency mining income occurs, it should be reported at the currency’s fair market value. This revenue should be shown on your income statement since it increases your assets.Similar to other revenue-generating activities, companies engaged in cryptocurrency mining are required to report their crypto profits on their balance sheet. Their mining income account will be credited as a result. Subsequently, the newly generated digital asset has to be recorded in their accounts at its fair market value.Additionally, costs related to mining operations should be recorded. For example, the cash account needs to be credited if cash is spent to cover mining costs. The purchase of mining equipment, which requires capitalization and amortization, will subsequently be deducted from the associated asset account or otherwise documented as a cost for items like utilities and supplies.Using cryptocurrency to pay suppliersPaying suppliers or vendors with cryptocurrency is like selling the asset since you have to recognize any gain or loss in relation to its original value. Therefore, the difference between the asset’s book value and its expense will be recorded as a capital gain.How to record transaction fees and exchange rates It’s critical to keep track of transaction costs and exchange rate fluctuations when trading or exchanging cryptocurrencies. Fees should be shown as an expense on the balance sheet since they lower your net gain or increase your loss. Changes in exchange rates may also have an impact on the value recorded when converting cryptocurrency into fiat, which could have an effect on your taxes and capital gains.Did you know? Cryptocurrency held for more than a year can be categorized as a long-term asset on your balance sheet in some jurisdictions, which may result in better tax treatment than short-term holdings.How are cryptocurrencies taxed?Taxation of cryptocurrencies varies by country, but your balance sheet plays a crucial role in tracking taxable events. Under current GAAP, crypto is recorded at cost and tested for impairment. IFRS allows revaluation in rare cases, but most entities use the cost model. For traders holding crypto as inventory, GAAP (ASC 330) or IFRS (IAS 2) may apply, with FMV adjustments. The lack of definitive guidance means businesses must apply judgment and document assumptions clearly. In the US, crypto is treated as property, with taxes applied to capital gains when selling or trading. The Internal Revenue Service requires reporting on your balance sheet; losses can offset gains. Also, the US introduced Form 1099-DA in 2025 for crypto brokers to report transactions, increasing compliance requirements. In the UK, cryptocurrencies are taxed under capital gains for individuals, while income tax may apply if trading is frequent or when crypto is received as income, such as through mining, staking or as payment for services.Canada follows a similar approach, taxing crypto as capital gains (50% inclusion rate) or business income for active traders. Mining income is taxable as income.In Germany, long-term holders (over a year) pay no tax on capital gains, but short-term trades over 600 euros are taxed. Notably, the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation (effective 2024) standardizes crypto reporting, impacting balance sheet documentation in member states.Accounting for Ethereum transactionsEthereum, the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts, has unique accounting needs. Here’s how to handle common Ethereum transactions on your balance sheet:Staking rewards: Staking ETH on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network generates rewards, treated as income at FMV when received. For example, receiving 0.1 ETH as a staking reward debits your “Cryptocurrency” asset account and credits “Revenue” on your income statement. Selling staked ETH later triggers a capital gain or loss.Gas fees: Ethereum transactions incur gas fees, which are expenses. Record these as a debit to “Transaction Fees” (an expense account) and a credit to “Cash” or “Cryptocurrency” if paid in ETH. For example, a $50 gas fee paid in ETH reduces your ETH holdings and is expensed.DeFi transactions: Yield farming or liquidity provision (e.g., on Uniswap) generates rewards, treated as income at FMV when received. For example, earning 100 UNI (UNI) tokens ($1,000) debits “Cryptocurrency” and credits “Revenue.” Track gas fees and token swaps as expenses or taxable events.ERC-20 tokens: Ethereum-based tokens (e.g., USDC, LINK) are separate assets. Record each at its FMV at acquisition, like ETH, and track them individually to avoid confusion.Accurate tracking of Ethereum transactions ensures compliance, especially with increased IRS scrutiny on staking and DeFi in 2025.Tools and best practices for crypto accountingManaging crypto transactions can be daunting, but these tools and tips simplify the process:Accounting software: Use platforms like CoinTracker, Koinly or CryptoTaxCalculator to track Ethereum transactions, calculate gains/losses, and generate tax reports. These tools integrate with wallets and exchanges, ensuring accurate FMV records.Regular reconciliation: Match your balance sheet’s crypto holdings to wallet/exchange records monthly to catch errors, especially for gas fees or staking rewards.Work with professionals: Crypto tax rules, especially for Ethereum’s DeFi and staking, are complex. Consult a crypto-savvy accountant to ensure compliance with IRS, His Majesty’s Revenue & Customs or other regulations.Document everything: Keep records of every Ethereum transaction, including FMV, gas fees and staking rewards, to prepare for audits or Form 1099-DA reporting in 2025.By staying organized, you’ll minimize errors and stress when filing taxes or preparing financial statements.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-trading-gains-and-losses-on-balance-sheet?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-21T15:00:00.000Z,"Crypto&#039;s real momentum isn&#039;t in the charts; it&#039;s in developer activity","Opinion by: Markus Levin, co-founder of XYOThe crypto community often experiences periods of heightened anxiety. Market downturns are often triggered by counterproductive sentiment-driven events rather than by fundamental issues, creating a significant disconnect between price behavior and the actual progress being made within the industry by the companies within it. What often goes unnoticed is how much real development happens during these downturns. While market movements capture most of the attention, teams are building faster and more deliberately behind the scenes than ever. The focus shifts away from price speculation and toward real execution. Growth happens during downturns. It's a necessary phase for projects that thrive in a volatile industry. They re-focus attention on refining their technology and business, fueling the next wave of progress.As a result, there's a disconnect between online sentiment and conversations between blockchain industry leaders. For builders and project leaders, the atmosphere is of determination, not doom.Regulators are coming on boardOne of the most promising developments is the accelerating momentum of regulation policy. Many European companies are applying for MiCA licenses in preparation for regulatory updates. There's also a significant policy shift under new US leadership as the SEC retreats from several high-profile crypto enforcement actions. The disparity between sentiment and reality serves as a reminder that price is a lagging indicator. Selloffs are triggered by uncertainty around tariff announcements and background activity such as interest rates. Material, long-term statistics speak for the virtually universal optimism among industry leaders as the number of active developers has remained stable, and the number of established developers almost doubled last year. That's an incredible jump in only one year. From hype to substanceMaturation means teams thoughtfully building, governments engaging seriously with legislation, and users demanding better UX and real utility. The industry has a well-established pattern — market corrections wipe away hype and encourage focus. The last bear market gave rise to breakthroughs in DeFi, NFTs, and zero-knowledge tech. This time, it's about real-world infrastructure, regulation-ready platforms, and next-gen scalability.What emerges in these periods tends to be less visible but more durable. Teams that remain active are often those with clear models, sufficient runway, and a willingness to adapt. These are the periods when we learn whether the systems being built can handle real-world demands. One of the most promising frontiers lies at the intersection of AI and blockchain, the most ubiquitous being within Large Language Models. AI is, however, only as good as the data it's trained on.AI systems are evolving rapidly, but their foundations are skewed. They're built primarily on data scraped from the digital-first countries that predominantly lie in the northern hemisphere, which dominates global media production and internet usage. This creates a feedback loop where Western and East Asian perspectives and widely spoken languages such as English and Mandarin are not only amplified but leave little room for necessary data from smaller populations.A report from Web3 Technologies said 60% of tier-one media on the internet is English. Prominent among these media outlets is The New York Times, which has sued OpenAI based on copyright infringement. The publication alleges that their copyright-protected data was used to train OpenAI's LLM model. Recent: The future of finance is built on Bitcoin — Ethereum was just the testnetKnowing the full extent of the global imbalance in the data creating AI outputs is impossible. Allegations like this and the results delivered when using AI tools suggest the pressing need for a solution.It's even worse. When AI systems are trained on narrow, incomplete data sets, the results can exclude billions from the benefits of emerging technologies. As IBM highlights, data bias isn't just a technical issue — it's a human one with real-world consequences in healthcare, finance, agriculture, and beyond.It's become normal to use AI data every day. We receive personalized Google search results, Adobe has built AI into its industry-standard graphic and video software, and we use AI assistants like Gemini, Grok, and ChatGPT to formulate the thoughts with which we represent ourselves. All of these tools are affected by an overwhelming bias toward the center of a bell curve within their data sets, unable to access or address less common use cases.A popular example demonstrates this issue: Until recently, image generators could not create a full wine glass. No matter what prompt you provided, a wine glass full to the edge was beyond the capabilities of all known generative AI software because they had never been provided photos of wine glasses full to the brim. Their data sets had to be updated to correct this comical problem, which revealed a much more serious one.Decentralized data offers a solution. Globally incentivized systems like DePINs enable the participation of populations that would otherwise remain underserved, allowing the valuable data they provide to come online. This improves the service for everyone, making smaller global communities more accessible to commerce and enabling them easier access to the rest of the world. It also empowers smaller data creators to monetize their data rather than relinquishing it to tech giants. Where do we go from here?The crypto industry is entering a new phase. A phase that's more productive and sustainable. Expect to see rapid growth in working infrastructure, platforms and applications that welcome knowledgeable, consumer-friendly regulations and projects that respect the time and money of their users.Opportunities within the crypto space are changing but not shrinking. Our opportunities grow as we learn from what has not worked in the last few years. They will take time to develop, but successful builders will focus on long-term, incremental change and sound business practices rather than chasing fads and short-term profits.The momentum of real progress has never been stronger, and it is precisely during times like these, when it feels like no one's watching, that the foundations of the future are laid.Opinion by: Markus Levin, co-founder of XYO.

2025-05-21T14:00:55.000Z,"AI tool claims 97% efficacy in preventing ‘address poisoning’ attacks","Crypto cybersecurity firm Trugard and onchain trust protocol Webacy have developed an artificial intelligence-based system for detecting crypto wallet address poisoning.According to a May 21 announcement shared with Cointelegraph, the new tool is part of Webacy’s crypto decisioning tools and “leverages a supervised machine learning model trained on live transaction data in conjunction with onchain analytics, feature engineering and behavioral context.” The new tool purportedly has a success score of 97%, tested across known attack cases. “Address poisoning is one of the most underreported yet costly scams in crypto, and it preys on the simplest assumption: That what you see is what you get,” said Webacy co-founder Maika Isogawa.Address poisoning detection infographic. Source: Trugard and WebacyCrypto address poisoning is a scam where attackers send small amounts of cryptocurrency from a wallet address that closely resembles a target’s real address, often with the same starting and ending characters. The goal is to trick the user into accidentally copying and reusing the attacker’s address in future transactions, resulting in lost funds.The technique exploits how users often rely on partial address matching or clipboard history when sending crypto. A January 2025 study found that over 270 million poisoning attempts occurred on BNB Chain and Ethereum between July 1, 2022, and June 30, 2024. Of those, 6,000 attempts were successful, leading to losses over $83 million.Related: What are address poisoning attacks in crypto and how to avoid them?Web2 security in a Web3 worldTrugard chief technology officer Jeremiah O’Connor told Cointelegraph that the team brings deep cybersecurity expertise from the Web2 world, which they’ve been “applying to Web3 data since the early days of crypto.” The team is applying its experience with algorithmic feature engineering from traditional systems to Web3. He added:“Most existing Web3 attack detection systems rely on static rules or basic transaction filtering. These methods often fall behind evolving attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures.“The newly developed system instead leverages machine learning to create a system that learns and adapts to address poisoning attacks. O’Connor highlighted that what sets their system apart is “its emphasis on context and pattern recognition.” Isogawa explained that “AI can detect patterns often beyond the reach of human analysis.”Related: Jameson Lopp sounds alarm on Bitcoin address poisoning attacksThe machine learning approachO’Connor said Trugard generated synthetic training data for the AI to simulate various attack patterns. Then the model was trained through supervised learning, a type of machine learning where a model is trained on labeled data, including input variables and the correct output.In such a setup, the goal is for the model to learn the relationship between inputs and outputs to predict the correct output for new, unseen inputs. Common examples include spam detection, image classification and price prediction.O’Connor said the model is also updated by training it on new data as new strategies emerge. “To top it off, we’ve built a synthetic data generation layer that lets us continuously test the model against simulated poisoning scenarios,” he said. “This has proven incredibly effective in helping the model generalize and stay robust over time.“Magazine: Crypto-Sec: Phishing scammer goes after Hedera users, address poisoner gets $70K",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-system-has-97-claimed-efficacy-in-preventing-address-poisoning-attacks?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-21T13:19:44.000Z,"GENIUS Act legitimizes stablecoins for global institutional adoption","Stablecoin adoption among institutions could surge as the United States Senate prepares to debate a key piece of legislation aimed at regulating the sector.  After failing to gain support from key Democrats on May 8, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act passed the US Senate in a 66–32 procedural vote on May 20 and is now heading to a debate on the Senate floor.The bill seeks to set clear rules for stablecoin collateralization and mandate compliance with Anti-Money Laundering laws.Related: German gov’t missed out on $2.3B profit after selling Bitcoin at $57K“This act doesn’t just regulate stablecoins, it legitimizes them,” said Andrei Grachev, managing partner at DWF Labs and Falcon Finance.“It sets clear rules, and with clarity comes confidence. That’s what institutions have been waiting for,” Grachev told Cointelegraph during the Chain Reaction daily X spaces show on May 20, adding:“Stablecoins aren’t a crypto experiment anymore. They’re a better form of money. Faster, simpler, and more transparent than fiat. It’s only a matter of time before they become the default.”Source: CointelegraphSenate bill seen as path to unified digital systemThe GENIUS Act may be the “first step” toward establishing a “unified digital financial system which is borderless, programmable and efficient,” Grachev said, adding:“When the US moves on stablecoin policy, the world watches.”Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis, a co-sponsor of the bill, also pointed to Memorial Day as a “fair target” for its potential passage.  Grachev said regulatory clarity alone will not drive institutional adoption. Products offering stable and predictable yield will also be necessary.

Vugar Usi Zade, the chief operating officer at Bitget exchange, told Cointelegraph that “the bill doesn’t fully address offshore stablecoin issuers like Tether, which continue to play an outsized role in global liquidity.”He added that US-based issuers will now face “steeper costs,” likely accelerating consolidation across the market and favoring well-resourced players who can meet the new thresholds.Still, Zade acknowledged that the legislation could bring greater “stability” to regulated offerings, depending on how it is ultimately worded and enforced.

2025-05-21T13:00:00.000Z,"Guatemala’s largest bank integrates blockchain for cross-border payments","Guatemala’s largest bank, Banco Industrial, has integrated crypto infrastructure provider SukuPay into its mobile banking app, allowing locals to more easily receive remittances powered by blockchain technology. SukuPay’s infrastructure has been fully embedded inside the Zigi payment app, allowing Guatemalans to receive funds from the United States instantly for a $0.99 flat fee, the company disclosed on May 21. Users of the Zigi app do not need a crypto wallet or an International Bank Account Number (IBAN) to receive the funds, the company said. SukuPay CEO Yonathan Lapchik told Cointelegraph that the “key to mainstream adoption of blockchain technology is making it invisible to the end-user” so that there are no technical barriers. “That’s the only way we’ll scale blockchain to billions of people — by building the rails, not forcing people to learn how they work,” said Lapchik.Established in 1968, Banco Industrial has more than 1,600 service locations throughout Guatemala. As of 2023, it had over 150 million Guatemalan quetzals in assets, equivalent to roughly $20 million US. SukuPay said its integration with Zigi marks one of the first crypto-native protocols to be used inside a major Latin American retail bank.Banco Industrial has a long-term issuer default rating of BB.

Monthly remittances typically range from $131 to $648, representing between 6% and 23% of the sender’s average income.“Remittances are lifelines in this region, but they’re broken,” Lapchik told Cointelegraph. “Guatemala alone sees $21 billion in remittances every year, and families are losing 6% to 10% of that to fees and delays. These are people sending $300, $400 a month, and they can’t afford to wait days or pay that much just to get money home,” he said, adding:“Crypto solves this when it’s used the right way. It lets us move money instantly and at a fraction of the cost, integrated into the bank apps people already use.” Latin America is the second-fastest growing region in terms of crypto adoption, though Guatemala lags behind regional leaders Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia, according to a 2024 Chainalysis study.The study cited stablecoins as a primary adoption driver in the region. Crypto adoption in Latin America by total value received.

In a May 21 post on X, Legislative Council member Johnny Ng Kit-Chong said the bill had passed its third reading, clearing the final hurdle for adoption.“It is expected that by the end of this year, major institutions will be able to apply to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to become licensed stablecoin issuers,” Ng said.Image of the legislative assembly session.

Ng said Hong Kong is welcoming “global enterprises and institutions interested in issuing stablecoins to apply in Hong Kong,” offering to personally assist with introductions and collaboration:“I am also happy to facilitate connections and collaborate with all stakeholders to advance the development of Web3 in Asia and globally, with Hong Kong at the center.“Related: Hong Kong introduces crypto staking rules, reaffirms Web3 commitmentHong Kong aims to become a Web3 powerhouseNg said the legislation marks the first step on the road toward building Web3 infrastructure in Hong Kong. “The most crucial step is to develop more real-world applications.”Ng said stablecoin adoption has the potential to drive innovation in retail payments, cross-border trade and peer-to-peer transactions.  He added that he encourages the development and adoption of stablecoins, since “they represent a major financial innovation.” Regarding enhancing market stability, Ng suggested distributing interest earnings to stablecoin holders.Related: HashKey receives Hong Kong approval to offer crypto staking servicesInterest for stablecoin holdersAccording to Ng, “providing interest will strengthen the competitiveness of stablecoins.” This increased competitiveness, he explained, incentivizes broader participation and expands stablecoin market share, which supports what he views as sustainable growth.Ng’s remarks that yield-bearing stablecoins are more competitive follow recent positive data.

2025-05-21T11:19:25.000Z,"Yield-bearing stablecoins surge to $11B, now 4.5% of market: Report","Yield-bearing stablecoins have soared to $11 billion in circulation, representing 4.5% of the total stablecoin market — a steep climb from just $1.5 billion and a 1% market share at the start of 2024.One of the biggest winners of this trend is Pendle, a decentralized protocol that enables users to lock in fixed yields or speculate on variable interest rates. Pendle now accounts for 30% of all yield-bearing stablecoin total value locked (TVL), roughly $3 billion, the firm said in a report shared with Cointelegraph.  Pendle noted that stablecoins make up 83% of its $4 billion total value locked, a sharp rise from less than 20% just a year ago. In contrast, assets such as Ether (ETH), which historically contributed 80–90% of Pendle’s TVL, have shrunk to less than 10% of its TVL.Traditional stablecoins like USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC) do not pass on interest to holders. With over $200 billion in circulation and US Federal Reserve interest rates at 4.3%, Pendle estimated that stablecoin holders are missing out on over $9 billion in annual yield.Pendle TVL share by assets.

The approval allows yield-bearing stablecoins to operate under specific rules, including registration, disclosure requirements and investor protections.  Moreover, proposed bills like the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) and the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) further signal a favorable direction.Meanwhile, Pendle said it expects stablecoin issuance to double to $500 billion in the next 18 to 24 months. The firm also anticipates yield-bearing stablecoins to capture 15% of this market with $75 billion in issuance (7x growth from $11 billion).Yield-bearing stablecoins issuance.
