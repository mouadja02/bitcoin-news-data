According to experts, if this momentum continues, Bitcoin could soon target $115,000 to $116,000. However, like always, some ups and downs are expected along the way. Market data confirms that the trend is still bullish. Many who predicted a market crash have gone silent, as current charts and on-chain data show a different picture. While Bitcoin leads the way, several altcoins have also posted gains. Dogecoin rose by 7%, while other major altcoins gained between 2-4%. Pi Coin Eyes $1 One standout is Pi Network’s coin, which jumped 10%, reaching a high of $0.86 before settling around $0.84. The next target for Pi is to cross the $1 mark, a level many supporters are eagerly watching. However, for Pi Coin to hit $1, it should first cross the important resistance level at $0.94. Even though more Pi coins are being unlocked, the price is still rising. This could be because of various factors: First, a $100 million fund was launched to support Pi projects. Second, many people are choosing to hold their Pi instead of selling. What’s Next For Crypto Market? Experts believe that once Pi Network secures listings on major exchanges, it could see a big rise in price and popularity. On the other hand, Bitcoin is still looking strong on the charts, with indicators like RSI and MACD showing positive momentum. Although Bitcoin has entered the overbought zone, it hasn’t reached extreme levels yet, meaning there’s still room for growth. If Bitcoin slows down after a while, altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and XRP might see stronger price movements next. Whales are actively buying more Bitcoin, a good sign for the market’s health.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/pi-network-soars-10-as-bitcoin-climbs-above-110000-whats-next-for-pi/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING","News|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis",cryptocompare
2025-05-22T02:45:00.000Z,"BITW: The Valuation Setup For 'Altcoins'","Summary BITW offers investors exposure to 10 cryptocurrencies in a simple 'diversified' fund. The fund has a large allocation to Bitcoin, which could hurt returns if a true 'altseason' were to manifest. At 2.5%, the fund has a high expense ratio and doesn't stake any of the PoS assets under management, producing an opportunity cost relative to holding the assets directly. The top 4 assets make up over 97% of the fund's capital; none of those 4 assets are 'cheap' in my view. At a 14% discount to NAV, BITW could serve as a potential arbitrage trade if/when more spot ETFs cover the crypto market in the US. I've covered the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund ETF (BITW) for Seeking Alpha four times going back to 2023. My general thinking on the fund can be summed up in this way; I like it slightly better than its closest peer, the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund ETF (GDLC) because of a broader offering of assets, but I don't think it's the best way to play a rally in the altcoin market at this juncture. While the fund can occasionally serve as an interesting arbitrage opportunity when it trades a steep discount to net asset value, there are disadvantages with both the fund and its construction. In this update, we'll briefly review some of the pros and cons to holding BITW shares, as well as assess how I view the current valuation setup for the fund's top 4 holdings. Pros and Cons of BITW For speculators who want simple exposure to the digital assets in a single ticker, BITW works fine. As I see it, these are the top advantages of BITW over something like GDLC: BITW GDLC AUM $1.44b $775m NAV Per Share $70.90 $48.81 Market Price $60.83 $42.40 Discount to NAV 14.2% 13.1% BTC Weighting 78.0% 79.5% Fund Holdings 10 5 Sources: Grayscale and Bitwise as of May 20th Closing Prices Not only does BITW have a slightly bigger discount to NAV at 14.2% currently, but the fund also offers exposure to more assets than GDLC and has slightly less reliance on BTC for fund performance. With roughly double the AUM than that of GDLC, BITW has strong liquidity and gets a 'B+' liquidity grade from Seeking Alpha. As I see it, there are three important disadvantages to holding a fund like BITW over alternatives; expense ratio, asset weighting, and opportunity cost. At a 2.5% expense ratio, BITW is way too expensive for what is essentially a passively managed fund that is nearly 80% Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). Bitcoin Dominance 5/21/25 (CoinGlass) Bitcoin's dominance of the $2.06 trillion digital asset market is 61.5% per CoinGlass data. While this is obviously a large share of the crypto market, BITW and GDLC are both closer to 80% BTC. To be sure, the overwhelming majority of the assets in the cryptocurrency market are entirely uninvestable. Thus, over-weight BTC makes sense. But there are assets held within BITW that I do think could be long-term successes and even potentially outperform BTC over the next 10 to 20 years. In that regard, choosing BITW over something like a self-directed crypto-IRA might not make sense for long-term investors who have a willingness to open such an account - and there are several providers. Another potential issue with BITW is the opportunity cost of holding stake-able assets dormant in a fund that isn't generating yield. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) and Solana ( SOL-USD ) collectively make up nearly 15% of BITW positioning. Each of those assets are stake-able for yield and provide investors a positive real yield after token emissions inflation. It is anticipated that staking could soon be permitted in US-based crypto ETFs under the current administration. If such products enter the market, BITW could theoretically trade at a deeper discount to NAV. Top Holdings Valuation Assessment The fund always has 10 assets under management, though those assets with smaller allocations do often change. As of May 20th, BITW asset weightings are as follows: BITW Holdings 5/20/25 (Bitwise) I've already mentioned the large weighting to BTC. From there, ETH commands 11%, XRP ( XRP-USD ) claims 5%, and SOL comes in at 3.2%. With less than 2% combined allocation to the bottom five assets in the fund, I'm not going to spend much time on those networks. However, the top 4 coins in the fund do have a meaningful allocation and represent more than 97% of BITW. We'll take a look at network valuation metrics for those funds and examine what, if any, alternatives there may be for investors who want larger exposure to those assets than what is currently provided by Bitwise. We already know BITW trades at a discount to the fund's liquidation value. But what about the assets themselves? Can we justify such coin prices based on fundamental usage? I've covered Bitcoin's valuation in prior SA pieces. My personal view is that the NVT ratio is a decent way to assess BTC valuation because it utilizes the coin's market cap as well as the dollar-denominated value transferred over the network. BTC Price vs 30 Day Average NVT ( Coin Metrics ) The multi-year trend in BTC's 30-Day average NVT ratio is admittedly not a great one. What this shows is that over the longer term, as BTC's price moves higher, the NVT ratio generally does as well. That said, at 186 currently, the NVT ratio is well-off highs from last summer. I would personally like to see this ratio come down even further. But what I find to be a positive sign currently is the price rise in BTC near the end of last year was accompanied by a deep drop in NVT ratio. This would indicate that the coin price wasn't outgrowing the transferred value. In my view, NVT is good for networks that intend to be 'payment chains.' Because of this, we could choose to view XRP through this lens as well: BTC vs XRP NVT Ratio ( Coin Metrics ) Believe it or not, XRP was actually cheaper than BTC based purely on NVT ratio for most of the last two and half years. While the 220 ratio reading for XRP currently is back ahead of BTC, the long-term trend for XRP's NVT valuation has been quite opposite that of BTC. I'm not arguing either of these coins are 'cheap' based on this metric - quite the opposite, actually. But I think these can be helpful in showing long-term price vs usage trends. For the smart contract chains, fees are a meaningful part of the underlying economics of the networks. There, I like to look at price to fees ratios of the chains: Weekly Circulating P/F Ratios (Token Terminal) Token Terminal's data shows Ethereum is trading at over 760x fees. Based on this metric, Ethereum is now valued more richly than NEAR Protocol ( NEAR-USD ). Solana, which has been cheaper than Ethereum on a circulating P/F multiple since October, is also seeing the ratio generally moving in the wrong direction. At 136x fees currently, Solana has seen significant multiple expansion since February. What Alternatives to BITW Are There? I've already mentioned that investors who have a willingness to open self-direct crypto IRAs can certainly do that. In those types of accounts, there are typically no storage fees, but transaction fees can be high for those who are active traders. There are usually dozens of trade-able digital assets, and it would be quite easy to overweight most of the top 'altcoins' in the market if one were so inclined. However, not everyone wants to open an additional account due to either the inconvenience or the potential personal data security concern - each of which are justifiable in my view. Can BITW's current digital asset exposure be mimicked by purchases of single-asset products that are already available in the market? Possibly. Asset Spot ETF? Closed-End Fund? Leveraged Fund? Bitcoin Yes Yes Yes Ethereum Yes No Yes XRP No No Yes Solana No Yes No Cardano ( ADA-USD ) No No No Sui ( SUI-USD ) No No No ChainLink ( LINK-USD ) No Yes No Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ) No No No Litecoin ( LTC-USD ) No Yes No Polkadot ( DOT-USD ) No Yes No Source: Author's compiled data, funds must be secondary market trade-able not only available through private placement As far as I can tell, only three of the assets in BITW are lacking direct exposure through some combination of spot ETFs, closed-end funds, or leveraged funds. Collectively, those three assets make up less than 2% of BITW. So it is theoretically possible to self-direct exposure to the majority of the assets in BITU through a standard brokerage account utilizing the single-asset products that are already available in the market. Closing Thoughts For those who want a simple way to get exposure to some of the top assets in the cryptocurrency market, BITW will work perfectly fine. Potential investors should keep in mind that there are downsides to getting exposure in this way. In my view, the expense ratio is too high, 78% exposure to BTC defeats the purpose of a 'diversified' fund, and there is an opportunity cost to holding stake-able assets in a fund that doesn't stake them for yield. That said, at a 14% discount to NAV, BITW is somewhat interesting as a potential arbitrage trade should be more of these assets get spot ETFs in the US. While I don't personally hold this fund at this time, it's one of which I've held in the past and would consider holding again if the discount gets to parity with the non-BTC asset allocation of the fund. That said, the discount arbitrage can close simultaneously to a drop in share price. That's a major risk to consider. I would argue that none of the assets in BITW could realistically be considered 'cheap' based on network usage levels.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4789011-bitw-the-valuation-setup-for-altcoins?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","BTC-USD|ETH-USD|SOL-USD|XRP-USD|BITW",cryptocompare

2025-05-22T02:42:26.000Z,"Bitcoin continues rally to surpass $110K for the first time","Bitcoin has topped $110,000 for the first time in a recent rally that has seen it gain 3% over the past day to break through past price highs from earlier this year. Bitcoin ( BTC ) hit a new all-time high of $110,788.98 on Coinbase late on May 21, just before 11:30 pm UTC, according to TradingView. Bitcoin has gained around 3% over the last 24 hours, surpassing its all-time high of $109,458 that it hit earlier in the day, which was the first time it traded above its previously long-held Jan. 20 peak. The world’s largest cryptocurrency has now gained 17.5% so far this year and is up 47% since its slump to $75,000 on April 7, triggered by US President Donald Trump enacting sweeping tariffs that tanked global markets. Bitcoin’s new peak comes as US stock markets were rattled by a weak 20-year bond auction, which sent treasury yields soaring on May 21. The S&P 500 fell 80 points in half an hour while the Nasdaq and Dow Jones mirrored the move, with all US indexes trading down on the day. Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows it has climbed out of a slump earlier this year. Source: TradingView Caroline Bowler, CEO of the Australian crypto exchange BTC Markets, said in a note to Cointelegraph that Bitcoin’s new high “reflects a mature interest in digital assets worldwide, not the speculative surge seen in past cycles.” “Today’s demand is driven by institutional-grade infrastructure and stronger regulatory clarity. Investor sentiment has shifted decisively, reflecting institutional-style allocations,” she added. According to Google Trends, searches for Bitcoin have been trending down since November and are at lows typical of crypto bear markets, indicating a low retail interest in the cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which tracks market sentiment, was at a score of 72 out of 100 on May 22, indicating “greed.” The index is down from its 2025 high of 84 on Jan. 22, which came two days after Trump’s inauguration. Related: How high can Bitcoin price go? Edward Carroll, head of global markets and corporate finance at MHC Digital Group, told Cointelegraph in a note that growing demand driving the price higher in the medium-term could push Bitcoin to at least $160,000 by the fourth quarter of this year and $1 million by 2030. Trader’s leveraged Bitcoin bet tops $1.1B Meanwhile, leverage trader James Wynn’s Bitcoin long position on the crypto platform Hyperliquidity has become the largest onchain margin trade when it exceeded $1.1 billion amid Bitcoin’s price peak. The entry point for the 40x leveraged position was $108,065 and it has an unrealized profit of $20 million. It will be liquidated if Bitcoin’s price falls to $103,800.

2025-05-22T02:30:00.000Z,"Bitcoin: Maybe I Wasn't Wrong (Technical Analysis)","Summary I am upgrading BTC-USD to a 'strong buy' as Bitcoin decisively broke all-time highs, overcoming bearish technical signals and strong resistance. Bullish momentum is reinforced by weakness in the U.S. Dollar Index and limited upside in the S&P 500, favoring capital rotation into cryptocurrencies. Potential risks include a bearish Deep Crab pattern and political uncertainty around the U.S. strategic cryptocurrency reserve, but these are not my base case. I will reconsider my outlook if Bitcoin falls below $106,140, but current sentiment and technicals support further upside in the near term. When I last covered Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ) on March 2nd, 2025, with my article “Bitcoin: I Was Wrong”, cryptocurrency prices were beginning to lose some of the luster that was present following President Donald Trump’s public comments suggesting that he intended to become the world’s first cryptocurrency President . Of course, these were not just words, there were real actions supporting the bullish long-term cryptocurrency outlook in the United States . Of course, these are deeply positive scenarios for anyone holding large-cap cryptocurrencies, and BTC-USD prices have responded in kind. Since my last analysis was developed, BTC-USD has actually gained by more than +13% even while the S&P 500 has encountered losses of -1.81%. But the story is a bit more complicated than that because bitcoin prices have actually been on a bit more of a roller coaster ride than those somewhat subtle gains might imply. Given bitcoin’s ability to recover losses and form a base at elevated levels, I am raising my rating outlook to a “strong buy” while this newest rally is still in its earliest stages. Bitcoin: Substantial Two-Way Reversals (Income Generator via TradingView ) First, let’s quickly define the most recent “rally” because there are definitely elements of the bitcoin trend that seem to contradict this outwardly bullish assertion. As we can see in the chart above, BTC-USD actually continued to drop (by about -22%) after my prior pessimistic article was published. As a result, I suppose that you could say I was “right” about being “wrong” but market prices quickly reversed into the positive direction after falling below $75,000. This reversal is essentially the main reason I will have to eat some crow with my analysis update today because the bullish trend wave was forceful enough to generate gains of nearly 48% and break above an all-time high resistance level in the process. Bitcoin: Significance of Recent Breakout (Income Generator via TradingView ) When discussing these events with my own trading group, I described the price action of the last few days as being a textbook example of a consolidation zone. Whenever you are dealing with the test of an all-time high (especially when dealing with a high-volume and highly volatile trading asset), the general expectation is that selling pressure is likely to start building as prices continue moving upward. Unfortunately, this can occur either as short-sellers begin to emerge near a critical resistance zone or as bullish cryptocurrency investors start to take profits on prior successful trades. Bitcoin prices, however, really did not experience very much of this type of price action. Almost like a snake hiding in the grass and waiting to strike its prey, BTC-USD prices hovered just below the triple-top resistance region near $107,355 (as well as the +2 standard deviation on the shorter-term time frames). When we did not see any significant pullback from the $107,355 level, I immediately flipped bullish because there were two different negative technical signals (bearish triple-top resistance pattern and the movement of prices into the +2 standard deviation) and neither of them were having much of an effect. Bullish volumes were also rising quite sharply right into this resistance level, and all of this essentially provided a perfect storm of bullish elements that allowed buyers to overcome sellers and print a new record high. Bitcoin: Comparative Trends in U.S. Dollar Index (Income Generator via TradingView ) In order to get a better sense of where cryptocurrency trends are actually headed next, I think it might be important to assess relative performances in peripheral asset classes. As the world’s reserve currency , trends in the U.S. Dollar are often best assessed using the U.S. Dollar Index, and we can see some interesting developments for the greenback when looking at the daily timeframe. Specifically, we can see that the U.S. Dollar Index recently invalidated prior trend momentum readings in the Relative Strength Index ((RSI)) near the beginning of this month. However, upside follow-through has been lacking, with the RSI breaking back below the daily exponential moving average (EMA). In the chart above, this activity is shown with the purple line in the indicator panel falling under the yellow exponential moving average. Importantly, share prices themselves are also trading back below all four major exponential moving averages (20-day, 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day periods) and this gives us a bearish confluence of events that seems to contradict the negative momentum break that was experienced earlier this month. As a result, our next downside price target for the U.S. Dollar Index is not seen until 97.921 (April 21st, 2025 lows). Overall, I expect this to have a positive BTC-USD impact in terms of price action - at least until major support in the U.S. Dollar Index is retested (and confirmed to hold). Bitcoin: Comparative Trends in S&P 500 (Income Generator via TradingView ) Another major peripheral asset that cryptocurrency trades should be watching would be the S&P 500 itself. At this stage, it is probably becoming irritating for many investors to listen to stock pundits talk about the potential for cryptocurrencies to become safe-haven assets . But if this characterization is actually an accurate characterization of the market majority, it might be reasonable to suggest that declining momentum in the S&P 500 could actually become beneficial for bitcoin investors. Based on the chart above, bullish BTC-USD arguments can be made right now, due to the fact that the S&P 500 has already failed at resistance following the sizable rallies that emerged after the crash into $4,835.04 in early April. Of course, the May 19th price highs at $5,968.61 rests less than 3% below the S&P 500’s all-time high of $6,147.43. For all of these reasons, I think it is very difficult to make the argument that the S&P 500 has a great deal of upside potential when the benchmark has already recovered most of the losses that have been experienced since January 31st, 2025. Bitcoin: Potential Bearish Signals (Income Generator via TradingView ) If we do believe that the potential for upside is limited in both the U.S. Dollar Index and S&P 500, where would we then expect investors to start flocking next? Small-cap stocks might be one possibility, perhaps treasuries might be another (especially given the long-term complexities of the current market environment). However, if broader selling pressure in DXY and the major U.S. stock benchmarks is not far away, bullish cryptocurrency investors really needed to see a break of important resistance levels in BTC-USD. This week, this did occur as the time-tested flagship cryptocurrency broke through prior all-time highs, but I will also mention potential risks to the positive outlook. In the chart above, we can see that even though historical resistance zones have been invalidated, cryptocurrency prices are still trading outside the +2 standard deviation and a bearish harmonic pattern has developed after the rally from just above $102,105 on May 19th. Specifically, this is a bearish Deep Crab pattern, and it is large enough to suggest that BTC-USD prices could fall back below $100,500 if the pattern reaches a full point of completion (which does not occur in a large majority of instances). We must also be aware of the fact that there has been a great deal of criticism with respect to the viability of President Donald Trump’s strategic cryptocurrency reserve, so much so that a BBC News article actually used the term “ pig in lipstick ” to describe Trump’s plans for a cryptocurrency future. Of course, if these criticisms turn out to be accurate, I think we might see the U.S. government reconsider efforts to operate the strategic cryptocurrency reserve under the next administration. Unfortunately, any financial news headlines centered in this direction would likely be accepted unfavorably by the cryptocurrency market, and I think that this is the type of event that could lead to the next crypto winter (if these types of events actually materialize). Of course, there are a lot of unknowns here and that negative scenario is not my base case right now. Ultimately, I think that the recent breaks of important resistance levels suggests that market sentiment is actually quite healthy and that the influence of short-sellers is diminishing in size. For all of these reasons, I am upgrading my BTC-USD outlook to a “strong buy” rating and I will reconsider my outlook if we see bitcoin fall below $106,140 (near-term pivot lows recorded during the May 21st trading session).",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4789008-bitcoin-maybe-i-wasnt-wrong?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","BTC-USD|SP500|DXY",cryptocompare
2025-05-22T02:15:31.000Z,"The Top Altcoin for Massive Return Potential: Why Bitcoin Was a Missed Opportunity and Qubetics Emerges as the New Star","A wave of renewed interest is sweeping through the cryptocurrency market amid recent regulatory clarity and growing adoption of blockchain technologies. As major digital assets fluctuate, attention has turned toward altcoins promising substantial growth amid shifting market dynamics. Qubetics has emerged as a strong contender in this space, offering a compelling mix of real-world utility, advanced scalability, and AI-driven innovation. Identifying the top altcoin for massive return potential has become a critical focus for market participants—and Qubetics is increasingly being recognized as a project poised to deliver outsized gains in a volatile environment. One such project rising above the noise is Qubetics ($TICS), positioned to solve real-world challenges that older cryptocurrencies have struggled to address. With its unique ecosystem and ongoing crypto presale, Qubetics is attracting considerable attention as the next top altcoin for massive return potential. This article explores why Bitcoin, despite its dominance, may have been a missed opportunity for many, while Qubetics provides a fresh avenue with promising upside. Bitcoin: The Missed Giant in the Race for Massive Returns Bitcoin undeniably revolutionized finance by introducing decentralized digital currency to the masses. It sparked a global movement and built the foundation for the entire crypto industry. However, many who overlooked Bitcoin in its early days now reflect on missed chances to secure extraordinary returns. The cryptocurrency’s historical price surges from mere cents to tens of thousands of dollars per token remain legendary. Despite Bitcoin’s pioneering status, its scalability issues, transaction fees, and environmental concerns have led to growing interest in alternative projects that can deliver faster, more versatile solutions. Bitcoin’s relatively high price per token today presents barriers to new entrants seeking exposure to crypto growth without risking excessive capital. Analysts note that Bitcoin’s established presence often overshadows innovative projects that might offer higher growth trajectories. In a market where timing is critical, missing Bitcoin’s early rise serves as a cautionary tale. Meanwhile, altcoins with advanced technology stacks, targeted use cases, and accessible entry points are becoming increasingly attractive. Qubetics ($TICS): The New Top Altcoin for Massive Return Potential Qubetics is redefining the possibilities of blockchain utility with its multi-application ecosystem designed to serve businesses, professionals, and individuals alike. Unlike many projects that focus solely on speculation, Qubetics delivers practical tools and decentralized services that address real-life problems — from secure cross-border transactions to developer-friendly integrated development environments. Currently in its 35th crypto presale stage, Qubetics has sold over 513 million tokens to more than 26,800 holders, raising upwards of $17.2 million. The token is priced at an accessible $0.2785 during this phase, making it an enticing entry point for those aiming to capitalize on future growth. Analysts project that $TICS could reach $1 post-presale, representing a 258% return on investment, with even more optimistic forecasts placing it at $5 or higher after the mainnet launch. Application and Ecosystem Impact Qubetics introduces several core applications including QubeQode and Qubetics IDE, which empower users with decentralized tools for privacy, coding, and asset tokenization. QubeQode facilitates secure, private communication and transactions across borders. Businesses dealing with international clients benefit from lower fees and increased security, making it an attractive alternative to traditional financial networks. Qubetics IDE targets developers by providing an intuitive, decentralized development environment that supports multi-chain projects and seamless integration with blockchain protocols. Scenarios illustrate the ecosystem’s potential: A freelance developer in Central Asia leverages Qubetics IDE to build and deploy smart contracts without intermediaries, reducing costs and increasing transparency.

2025-05-22T02:11:25.000Z,"White House crypto czar says stablecoin bill will unlock trillions for US treasury","The White House’s top cryptocurrency official has declared that the proposed stablecoin legislation could unlock trillions of dollars in value for the US Treasury. During an interview on Wednesday , David Sacks, President Donald Trump’s top crypto and artificial intelligence advisor, made the bold prediction. “If we provide the legal clarity and legal framework for this, I think we could create trillions of dollars of demand for our Treasuries practically overnight, very quickly.” Sacks said in an interview . The targeted legislation is the GENIUS Act, which is short for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins. It would seek to establish federal standards for how stablecoins are originated and governed. This week, the bill passed a key test in the US Senate on a 66-32 cloture vote. This means it has cleared the 60-vote threshold needed to overcome a filibuster. Fifteen Democrats sided with Republicans in endorsing the measure — a testament to unusual bipartisan support. Under the bill, stablecoin issuers must hold reserves to cover every token they put into circulation. Those reserves must be easily accessible and safe assets, such as cash or US Treasury bonds. The idea is to make sure stablecoins remain exactly that: stable. David Sacks described the bill as “a national economic strategy” that would strengthen the US dollar in the internet industry. He said stablecoins provide a new, more efficient, cheaper, and real-time settlement payment system. Trump family’s crypto involvement raises financial and ethical concerns The bill has gained support but has also courted controversy , mostly because of the deep ties between the Trump family and the crypto industry. World Liberty Financial launched its stablecoin, USD1, backed by President Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr. US Treasuries and dollar deposits collateralize this coin — the precise type of asset that the GENIUS Act would sanction and regulate. Earlier this month, Abu Dhabi-based investment fund MGX pledged a significant investment in USD1, routing the funds through Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange. This marks the largest investment in the Trump-linked stablecoin to date. The development has alarmed many Democrats, who warn that the bill could funnel money directly into the President’s and his family’s financial pockets, creating an unprecedented conflict of interest. Senator Elizabeth Warren and other critics demand that stronger ethical safeguards be incorporated into the legislation to prevent elected officials from profiting personally. Despite those fears, Sacks expressed confidence that the bill would pass. However, he declined to address questions regarding Trump’s financial ties to crypto. Investors flock to stablecoins as Bitcoin surges past $110,000 Stablecoins are digital currencies pegged to real-world assets like the United States dollar. Unlike Bitcoin or many other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins are intended to remain steady and easy to use as payment. Their popularity is skyrocketing. A recent report by Deutsche Bank revealed that transactions of $28 trillion worth of stablecoins were conducted last year — more than even Visa and Mastercard combined. The stablecoin space is currently led by Tether, representing over 60% of the market, and is banked in the US by Cantor Fitzgerald. For now, bitcoin keeps soaring. It reached a fresh high on Wednesday at nearly $110,000 a coin. Sacks believes that stablecoins can be a tool to help the US keep the dollar strong in a world that’s going online and fast. “It also gives the dollar continued dominance online,” he said.

2025-05-22T02:09:29.000Z,"Why did Bitcoin just hit an all-time high?","Bitcoin surged past $110,000 on Wednesday evening, setting a new all-time high as crypto rallied hard. The previous peak for Bitcoin ( BTC ), reached during President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January, was surpassed in late morning trading, according to crypto.news data. The buying momentum sustained after U.S. equity markets closed with the largest cryptocurrency by market cap pushing above $110,000. Bitcoin has gained more than 4.5% in the past 24 hours and over 23% in the last month, reflecting a sharp reversal from April’s downturn. You might also like: The Graph enables cross-chain transfer of GRT with Chainlink’s CCIP U.S. equities The rally mirrors the broader recovery in U.S. equities, despite Wednesday’s sell-off on Wall Street. Since late April, the S&P 500 has climbed 15%, while the Nasdaq is up more than 21%. Analysts attribute the bounce to growing optimism that President Trump’s trade policies may be less aggressive than initially feared. After introducing steep tariffs in early April—including a blanket 10% import tax and additional penalties for Chinese goods—the White House signaled a partial retreat . A 90-day pause on the most severe measures was announced last week by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent following negotiations with Chinese officials. Bitcoin initially fell to a two-month low of $76,000 shortly after Trump unveiled the tariffs, reflecting market fears over a broader global slowdown. Despite Bitcoin’s reputation as a hedge against traditional financial assets, it often trades in tandem with risk-on equities, especially tech stocks.

Enclave Markets CEO Phil Wirtjes said the rally was “likely aided by policy advancements,” particularly bipartisan progress on stablecoin legislation . A draft bill that would establish clearer rules for USD-backed digital tokens has gained traction in the Senate. Institutional demand has also picked up. Spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted $329 million in inflows over the last 24 hours. Bitcoin’s latest rally raises questions about how much of its performance is driven by macro versus crypto-native factors. While regulatory clarity and ETF inflows are key tailwinds, the correlation with stocks suggests that investor appetite for risk remains a dominant force in both arenas.

2025-05-22T02:00:41.000Z,"New Breakout Favorite? MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Ethereum Are Leading Trader Buy Lists","As May 2025 unfolds, conviction-driven capital is flowing into a new set of crypto leaders. From institutional buyers to early-stage speculators, the spotlight is now on four tokens: Bitcoin (BTC), XRP, MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA), and TRON (TRX). Each brings a distinct edge—macro leadership, payment utility, early-stage asymmetric potential, and high-throughput infrastructure. But for those seeking the biggest ROI, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now the most aggressively positioned altcoin in the space. CLICK HERE – 2025’S BIGGEST LAUNCH IS LIVE Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Being Backed for Major Returns MAGACOIN FINANCE has rapidly emerged as one of the top early-stage altcoins of 2025, with analysts calling it a rare opportunity for 20x–35x returns before listings begin. With Stage 8 live, over $8 million raised, and a fixed listing target of $0.007, MAGA’s blend of political branding, scarcity-driven 100 billion token supply, and Hashex-audited contracts is fueling massive momentum. As Stage 8 accelerates, those entering now are acting on a clear risk-reward model, not just hype. With listings approaching, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly ranked as the #1 altcoin presale for 2025, and analysts say 35x–50x returns are possible as demand surges. XRP: Utility, Legal Clarity, and Institutional Momentum XRP is staging one of the strongest comebacks in crypto history, trading at $2.38 as of May 21, 2025. With full legal clarity in the U.S. and a CME futures launch on the horizon, XRP is being positioned as the primary settlement and liquidity token for global financial institutions. Technical indicators suggest a bullish continuation, with analysts forecasting a move to $3 and beyond as volume and institutional interest grow. Ethereum: Technical Breakout and DeFi Expansion Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,593.53, up 1.66% in the past 24 hours and showing strong performance after a 50% rally in the past month. As the cornerstone of DeFi, NFTs, and Layer-2 innovation, Ethereum’s rising institutional interest and rapid Layer-2 adoption continue to bolster its outlook. Analysts expect ETH to push toward $3,000–$4,000 if support holds, with long-term targets even higher. Bitcoin: Macro Anchor as Capital Rotates Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $107,438, up 1.33% in the last 24 hours and maintaining its position above $106,000 after a strong May rally. While BTC remains the macro anchor and foundation for the market, capital is rotating into high-upside altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE and Ethereum as traders seek sharper returns. TRON: High-Throughput Utility and Steady Growth TRON (TRX) is trading at $0.27, with analysts forecasting a stable range for May and June 2025. TRON’s consistent throughput and low fees make it a favorite for payment corridors and DeFi applications. As speculative capital rotates, many TRX holders are also eyeing MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper early-stage upside. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Conclusion The smart money in May 2025 is moving with conviction—rotating into tokens with strong fundamentals, clear narratives, and explosive upside potential. Bitcoin and Ethereum provide the foundation, XRP and TRON offer scale and utility, but MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the strategic early entry for those seeking life-changing returns. With Stage 8 heating up and listings on the horizon, this could be the defining moment to secure a position before the next wave begins.

2025-05-22T02:00:15.000Z,"Bitcoin Breakout Narrative Explodes As Japan’s Bond Market Collapses","Japan’s government-bond complex, once the benchmark for low-yield stability, is cracking under the weight of its own arithmetic—and the fissures are sending tremors straight into the global debate about Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Thirty-year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields catapulted to 3.15% this week, eclipsing every prior high since the tenor’s 1999 debut. That print triggered an instant warning from the markets newsletter The Kobeissi Letter: “Japan’s bond market is imploding… Japan’s 30Y Government Bond Yield has officially surged to its highest level in history, at 3.15%. For decades, Japan was known for low long-term interest rates. Now they are dealing with high inflation, shifting policy outlook, and a whopping 260% Debt-to-GDP ratio.” Liquidity, always fragile at the long end of Tokyo’s curve, vanished just hours later. From New York, Zerohedge relayed traders’ disbelief: “This is unbelievable: for the second day in a row, Japan’s bond market is bidless, with both 30Y and 40Y JGB yields at record highs. Meanwhile, as the world’s 2nd biggest bond market is imploding, the BOJ is pretending nothing is happening.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Macro Trend Oscillator Shows When To Expect The Price Top Inside the Diet, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba delivered a stark political gloss: Japan’s fiscal plight, he conceded, is now “worse than Greece,” a phrase that would have been unthinkable during the deflationary 2010s. That assessment lands just as gross public debt pushes toward 260% of GDP and as Japanese investors—who still hold roughly $1.1 trillion of US Treasuries—contemplate selling overseas paper to shore up domestic books. Why This Is Ultra-Bullish For Bitcoin For Bitcoin analysts, the chain of causality is brutally clear. Pseudonymous macro voice Stack Hodler wrote to his followers: “Everyone expects Yield Curve Control. But Japan already tried YCC and look at what it got them—a spectacular bond-market implosion happening right in front of us. Now every Japanese bank, pension fund, and insurance company that trusted the Bank of Japan is holding a massive bag of flaming excrement… If this is the end result of YCC, why would any rational investor hold sovereign debt from severely indebted nations? Central-bank credibility is shattering in real time. Scarce neutral reserve assets—Bitcoin and gold—need to be repriced dramatically higher.” Dan Tapiero, founder of the $3.9 billion digital-asset vehicle 10T Holdings, reached much the same conclusion in fewer words: “Quietly…and off the radar…the Japanese long-bond yields are going parabolic. Time to watch Japan…Unsustainable deficits have been the norm for 30 yrs…Now a problem. Very bullish gold and Bitcoin.” The systemic-risk argument tightens further when one zooms out to the global balance sheet. Author Bruce Florian frames the macro math as musical chairs with a finite number of safe havens: “There are three times more debts than GDP, and interest rates are twice as high as economic growth… It’s like a game of musical chairs. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Fate May Be Sealed On June 9, Analyst Warns Everyone knows there are fewer chairs than players.” Florian highlights the feedback loop linking Tokyo and Washington: “The biggest buyer of US debt has been Japan… But this customer is now in financial trouble… There’s a high chance Japan will sell some of these bonds to stabilize its own situation… In a year when the USA needs to refinance $8 trillion, what happens if no buyers show up? The Fed will monetize the debt.” The punch line, he insists, is Bitcoin: “Bitcoin is shifting from a ‘nice-to-have’ asset to a must-have asset… In a world of unlimited debt, scarcity is the most radical form of reason.” Wall Street heavyweights are edging toward the same territory. JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon told investors on Monday, “I’m not a buyer of bonds. The risks are too high.” Ray Dalio wrote that the greater default risk now lies in “currency debasement,” not in missed coupons. And Larry Fink, whose firm’s spot-Bitcoin ETF has absorbed more than $31 billion since January, said on Fox Business that Bitcoin is “an international asset” fit for times when “countries devalue their currencies.” BTC Price Responds Bitcoin’s price action is responding in real time. BTC rose to $107,322 at press time, less than 4% shy of its halving-cycle high. None of this proves that Bitcoin is destined to replace sovereign debt, but the directional shift in marginal flows is no longer hypothetical. When the second-largest bond market on earth shows two consecutive bidless sessions and its prime minister compares the country to Greece, capital chases the assets whose supply cannot be printed. Bitcoin, engineered for hard-cap scarcity, slots neatly into that vacuum. Whether this is the moment sovereign debt loses the mantle of “risk-free” remains to be seen. What is indisputable is that the implosion of Japan’s ultra-long JGBs has handed Bitcoin its clearest macro tail-wind since 2020’s pandemic-era liquidity flood—except this time the narrative is not emergency stimulus but the dawning realization that even advanced nations are running out of balance-sheet room. For a growing cohort of investors, the word bond is beginning to rhyme less with safety and more with risk, while Bitcoin is rhyming—loudly—with insurance.

ProCap had boosted its IPO from $200 million to $220 million on May 20, a day before its public launch, pricing its 22 million shares on offer at $10 each. ProCap shares closed the May 21 trading day up 7% at $10.70, which continued with a 1.6% bump after-hours to $10.87, Yahoo Finance data shows. PCAPU’s share price closed up 7% on its debut trading day. Source: Yahoo Finance The company has offered underwriters a 45-day option to buy up to 3.3 million additional shares at the IPO price to cover extra demand. ProCap said in an April 30 regulatory filing that the firm will be a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) that will look to invest in, and potentially take public, companies in the financial services, digital asset, asset management or healthcare sectors. Pompliano is one of the crypto industry’s biggest cheerleaders , hosting a Bitcoin and finance-focused podcast and leading investment firm Professional Capital Management. Pompliano told CNBC on May 21 that he had been itching to take a company public over the last five years but hadn’t seen enough demand in the private market until six months ago, citing recent changes to the US regulatory landscape affecting financial markets. Related: Texas House passes strategic Bitcoin reserve bill He hinted that his blank-check firm would invest in crypto-native and traditional finance businesses as he expects the sectors to converge in the coming years. “The reason why I use the term financial services is basically the new digital world and the old incumbent world are all merging.” SPACs haven’t been done right in the past, Pomp says On CNBC, Pompliano was pressed on why he chose to make ProCap a SPAC, which have historically seen high failure rates due to sponsor conflicts, dilution, speculative valuations and regulatory scrutiny. Pompliano said SPACs have gotten a bad reputation because companies often treat them like public venture capital, targeting high-growth companies that are losing a lot of money at high valuations. Pompliano noted he has put “millions of dollars” of his own money on the line. “We’ve got real skin in the game,” Pompliano said, adding: “I’m taking a huge reputation risk.” Brent Saunders, CEO of health products firm Bausch + Lomb, also joined as a strategic adviser .

While Solana, Bitcoin, and XRP continue to dominate the top tier, one new contender is rapidly capturing trader attention: MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 now live, over $8 million raised, and whale inflows accelerating, traders from across the ecosystem—including major Solana and Bitcoin holders—are pivoting toward what’s now ranked as one of the most explosive breakout candidates of Q2 2025. Bitcoin (BTC): The Market Driver Fueling Altcoin Rotation Bitcoin is holding strong at $103,405, with whale addresses accumulating over 83,000 BTC since mid-April. Institutional inflows and ETF demand remain robust, with May price forecasts calling for an average of $121,351 and potential highs of $137,264. As BTC consolidates above $100K, capital is flowing into high-upside altcoins—MAGACOIN FINANCE is now at the top of that list for traders seeking the next 10,000% run. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: The #1 Breakout Entry of the Moment MAGACOIN FINANCE has seen a surge in whale accumulation as its presale advances, with over $8 million raised and the price still under $0.001. The project’s scarcity-driven model—a capped 100 billion token supply, 45% in presale, and HashEx-audited contracts—has made it one of the most dominant presales of 2025. Analysts forecast 35x–185x returns, with some models pointing to even higher upside if current momentum continues. Whale allocations and rapid presale sellouts highlight strong conviction, positioning MAGACOIN FINANCE as a top altcoin breakout for Q2 and Q3. With Stage 8 nearly full and listings approaching, this is the entry window to watch. XRP: Whale Accumulation and Bullish Reversal XRP is trading at $2.07, with whales accumulating over 880 million tokens in May alone. This surge in whale activity comes as XRP breaks out from a multi-month falling wedge, with analysts targeting $2.50–$2.80 as the next resistance levels. As institutional adoption grows and futures products launch, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s pre-listing momentum is also capturing the interest of XRP investors seeking early-stage upside. Solana: Whale Buying and Technical Breakout Solana (SOL) is trading at $166.71, consolidating after a sharp rally and drawing attention from large investors. Whale accumulation is on the rise, with major wallets withdrawing over 145,000 SOL from exchanges in recent days. Analysts are targeting $200 as the next major resistance, but many are also rotating into presale opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE for even greater potential returns. Ethereum and Aptos: Quiet Accumulation, Early-Stage Rotation Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,489, rebounding from recent lows and showing renewed technical strength. With DeFi growth and ETF speculation, ETH is poised for a potential breakout toward $2,750–$2,900 in the coming months. Aptos (APT) is also seeing quiet accumulation, but as capital seeks sharper upside, more traders are rotating into early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Final Thoughts Bitcoin and Solana whales are moving first, but XRP traders are quickly following as MAGACOIN FINANCE cements itself as 2025’s most-watched presale. With robust demand, a clear listing roadmap, and analysts projecting 35x–185x returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the most compelling early-stage opportunity of the year.

2025-05-22T00:30:55.000Z,"Solana Eyes $1,000 — But MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Bitcoin May Hit Their Targets First","With Solana’s price eyeing a four-figure milestone, the spotlight is shifting to a handful of tokens that are drawing heavy whale accumulation and analyst attention for 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE is leading the charge as Stage 8 nears completion, while XRP and Bitcoin continue to build institutional momentum. NEAR Protocol is also gaining traction, but it’s MAGA, XRP, SOL, and BTC that are now at the center of the next big crypto cycle. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is the Coin to Watch Before Stage 9 MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing serious attention as Stage 8 approaches its final phase, with over $8 million raised and a hard listing target of $0.007. Unlike legacy coins where much of the upside is already priced in, MAGA offers structured scarcity, surging demand, and transparent price discovery. Analysts are projecting a 35x–40x ROI from current levels, with some models suggesting even greater upside if listing momentum continues. Whale allocations, rapid presale sellouts, and a capped 100 billion token supply audited by HashEx are positioning MAGACOIN FINANCE as a rare ground-floor opportunity for Q2 and Q3 2025. Bitcoin: Macro Momentum and Whale Accumulation Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $103,405, having gained over 14% in the past 30 days and holding well above $100,000 7 . On-chain data shows major wallets accumulating, with ETF inflows stabilizing and analysts forecasting a plausible rally toward $150,000 if current trends hold. As Bitcoin’s macro narrative strengthens, early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE are benefitting from increased capital rotation. XRP: Derivatives, ETFs, and Global Settlement XRP is trading at $2.35, with whales accumulating over 880 million tokens in May alone. The launch of CME futures and growing ETF speculation are fueling institutional interest, while legal clarity and Ripple’s expanding partnerships are setting the stage for XRP to serve as a global settlement infrastructure asset. Analysts forecast a move to $2.85 by June and $5.50 by year-end, with $15 as a stretch target if ETF adoption accelerates. As institutional flows grow, many investors are also rotating into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for greater upside. Solana: Whale Accumulation and Technical Breakout Solana (SOL) is trading at $169.25, up 1.84% in the last 24 hours, and has rebounded over 50% from recent lows. Whale accumulation is accelerating, with large wallets withdrawing over 145,000 SOL from exchanges and analysts now eyeing the $200 level as a short-term target. While $1,000 remains a bold call, Solana’s bullish momentum is undeniable, but the most aggressive capital is also moving into MAGACOIN FINANCE for earlier, higher-multiple potential. NEAR Protocol: Quiet Growth and Breakout Potential NEAR Protocol (NEAR) is trading at $2.76, up 1% in the past 24 hours. Its developer ecosystem and integrations are expanding, but NEAR still lags the market leaders in momentum. As capital seeks undervalued networks, many NEAR holders are also looking to MAGACOIN FINANCE for early-stage, high-upside exposure. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW Conclusion Smart capital is converging around MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, Solana, and Bitcoin as the top altcoin picks for the 2025 bull run. With Stage 8 nearly full, robust demand, and a clear listing roadmap, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the most compelling early-stage opportunity of the year. The window for entry is closing—and those watching closely know this could be the cycle’s defining moment.

The rising optimism of an altseason amid the re-emergence of FOMO traders will help $B sustain bullish sentiment. A recently launched memecoin on the BSC chain dubbed BUILDon (B) rallied over 150 percent in the last 24 hours to trade above $0.1 on Wednesday, during the late North American trading session. The small-cap memecoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $102 million and a 24-hour average traded volume of about $60 million, recorded staggering gains after an endorsement from Donald Trump-backed World Liberty Financial (WLFI). According to an X post, the WLFI project purchased an undisclosed amount of $B tokens following its recent move to use the USD1 stablecoin as its base pair. “We just bought some $B to support the BUILDon team. Love seeing projects choose $USD1 as their base pair — faster settlement, deeper liquidity, and growth every day. We hope to see more tokens make the switch,” the announcement noted . What Next for BUILDon Following the WLFI Support The BUILDon memecoin has attracted more than 13k on-chain holders after a net pooled USD1 of over 842k to provide liquidity. The BSC mascot is well positioned to rally further in the coming days amid the rising demand for memecoins following the Bitcoin price pump towards a new all-time high. https://twitter.com/buildonbsc_ai/status/1925314302292238396?s=46 Furthermore, the memecoin culture on the BNB chain has gained significant traction in the recent past following the deliberate decision by Binance to support project developers.

2025-05-22T00:00:45.000Z,"$500 into $500K? MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Cardano Are Still Considered Major Summer Setups","As Bitcoin’s latest rally fuels confidence across the market, investors are scanning for the next wave of altcoins with exponential upside. While BTC dominates the headlines, the real growth potential often lies in low-to-mid-cap projects with room to outperform as capital rotates outward. This summer, MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Cardano are emerging as top setups for outsized gains as institutional inflows rise and market sentiment strengthens. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Becoming the #1 Choice in 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly gaining recognition as a highly asymmetric early-stage opportunity. Still trading under $0.07, the project has raised over $8 million, with Stage 8 now live and buy activity surging. MAGA’s $0.007 listing target and scarcity-driven tokenomics have analysts calling for 34x–40x returns—and some models point to even more extreme upside if current momentum continues. What sets MAGA apart is not just its viral political narrative, but its transparent tokenomics, Hashex audit, and a presale structure attracting both retail and whale capital. As Stage 8 nears completion, traders are calling this a rare chance to secure early exposure before MAGACOIN FINANCE hits exchanges. In a market searching for the next SHIBA or DOGE, MAGA’s combination of community energy, clear roadmap, and realistic price targets puts it at the top of many watchlists. XRP: Futures Launch and ETF Buzz XRP is trading at $2.36, with analysts watching closely as the CME Futures launch and ETF optimism fuel renewed interest. Legal clarity in the U.S. and growing payment adoption have analysts forecasting a move beyond $5 in the short term, with $15–$30 possible if key catalysts align. While a $100 price remains a stretch, the infrastructure being built by Ethereum, Cardano, and new contenders like MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the real drivers of the next major run. Cardano (ADA): Quiet Accumulation and Summer Breakout Cardano (ADA) is trading around $0.85 as of May 2025, with forecasts calling for a steady climb to $1.05 by July and $1.50 by October. Developers have returned, and on-chain metrics are starting to improve. If ADA delivers on upcoming milestones, it could surprise investors with a strong recovery this summer. Many Cardano stakers are rotating into MAGACOIN FINANCE for higher near-term upside, as ADA’s slow pace gives way to more aggressive early-stage plays. Litecoin and Bitcoin: Steady Anchors, But Seeking Momentum Litecoin (LTC) is trading at $103.77, showing steady accumulation but facing resistance near $105. Bitcoin (BTC) is holding above $103,000, with May price predictions between $110,000–$115,000 as institutional interest remains strong. While both remain core holdings, the biggest near-term upside is shifting toward more nimble early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Conclusion As summer kicks off, the 2025 cycle is creating new lanes for growth. XRP and Cardano bring proven value, but it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that’s introducing the kind of high-reward opportunity this market thrives on. With narrative strength, market traction, and investor interest all converging, MAGACOIN FINANCE could still be the next great crypto success story. The window for entry is closing—and those watching closely know this could be the cycle’s defining moment.

2025-05-22T00:00:17.000Z,"Bitcoin UTXO Profit/Loss Ratio Sits Below Critical Levels – How Long Until BTC Overheats?","Bitcoin is on the verge of entering uncharted territory after briefly tagging the $108,000 level earlier today. The flagship cryptocurrency has surged more than 40% since early April, fueled by rising market optimism and institutional demand. However, price is showing hesitation near the all-time high (ATH), now consolidating around $106,000. This key level is acting as both resistance and a psychological barrier, creating mixed sentiment across the market. While many analysts remain bullish, calling for a breakout that could take Bitcoin into price discovery, others are cautioning against premature euphoria, pointing to the potential for a sharp retrace if momentum stalls. Top analyst Axel Adler shared insights suggesting that every strong price acceleration shifts a significant volume of coins from loss into profit, an event that typically pushes the 30-day simple moving average (SMA) of the UTXO profit-to-loss ratio above 200. That level has historically marked overheated conditions and preceded major corrections. As of now, the metric sits at 99, indicating that the market has not yet entered a phase of overheating. This suggests that Bitcoin still has room to run before sentiment becomes excessive, leaving the door open for further upside—or a critical rejection. Momentum Or Correction? Key Metric Suggests Bitcoin Still Has Room to Run This is a pivotal week for Bitcoin and the entire crypto market, with price action set to determine the direction of the coming weeks. After reaching the $107,000 mark on Sunday, Bitcoin was quickly rejected, retracing more than 4% and settling around $106,000. That fakeout highlighted the market’s fragility near the all-time high (ATH) zone. A clean breakout above $109,000 would confirm the continuation of the powerful bullish trend that began in 2023. But if Bitcoin loses current levels and falls below key demand, it could trigger a deeper correction, shaking bullish conviction. Adler provided key insight into market sentiment by analyzing the UTXO profit-to-loss ratio. Historically, every strong acceleration in price that rapidly shifts coins from loss into profit causes the 30-day simple moving average (SMA) of this metric to spike above 200, signaling overheating and often marking the start of a distribution phase. At present, the SMA sits at 99, well below the warning threshold, indicating no signs of excess yet. Adler points out that while Bitcoin still has room to grow, the “easy fuel” behind recent gains is fading. A much stronger push or more volatile price action will be needed to drive the metric higher. Interestingly, this aligns with a larger pattern—this cycle’s third compression phase. If the analogy holds, this coiled spring may soon release energy powerful enough to send Bitcoin well beyond its ATH, but the risk of rejection remains very real. Technical Analysis: Key Weekly Price Action Bitcoin is trading at $106,394 after reaching a local high of $108,035 earlier today. The chart shows BTC holding above the $103,600 breakout level, now acting as a strong support zone. Price action confirms a bullish structure, with higher highs and higher lows forming over the past few weeks. The 200-day SMA at $93,186 and the 200-day EMA at $88,855 remain well below the current price, reinforcing the strength of the ongoing uptrend. However, price is now consolidating below all-time highs, with clear resistance near the $109,000 level. This area marks a crucial test for bulls. Breaking above it would confirm a move into price discovery and could trigger a wave of momentum buying. On the other hand, failure to push higher may result in a retest of the $103,600 or even the $100,000 psychological level. Volume has remained moderate despite the recent rally, suggesting that a strong breakout will require higher participation. The structure currently resembles a high consolidation zone, often a precursor to a volatile move. Bulls remain in control for now, but any drop below $103,600 would weaken short-term momentum and potentially trigger a broader retracement. All eyes remain on BTC’s behavior around the ATH zone.

2025-05-22T00:00:10.000Z,"Feds Charge Atlanta Man for Allegedly Applying for Over $3,390,000 in Fraudulent Small Business Loans During COVID","US authorities arrested an Atlanta man this week on charges related to his alleged connection to a COVID-19 relief loan application fraud ring. The Department of Justice (DOJ) alleges that Ian Patrick Jackson, 37, conspired with another Atlanta man to recruit at least nine business owners to submit fraudulent Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan applications using fake tax documents. Jackson allegedly told the business owners to falsely claim they each employed 16 individuals and paid monthly wages of $120,000. The DOJ says the owners then wrote falsified payroll checks to people who didn’t work for them and then either kept the money for themselves or paid Jackson via his co-conspirator. Jackson is allegedly connected to 15 fraudulent COVID-19 relief loan applications that inked $3.39 million in proceeds. He’s the 12th person to be charged in connection with an Atlanta-based PPP fraud ring, with the 11 previous defendants having already pled guilty or been convicted at trial. The DOJ says authorities have recovered nearly $1.2 million of the defrauded funds. Jackson also allegedly applied for a separate $237,500 PPP loan using fabricated tax forms and used a forged driver’s license and false revenue statements to fraudulently apply for approximately $100,000 in PPP and Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program loans. The DOJ also says he fraudulently secured another $240,035 PPP loan and $125,000 in EIDL program loans and grants on behalf of another company. Jackson has been charged with conspiracy to commit bank fraud, two counts of bank fraud, two counts of wire fraud and two counts of money laundering. The charges could result in decades in prison.

2025-05-21T23:30:46.000Z,"Bitcoin Shows Elevated Unrealized Profits Without Signs Of Panic Selling – New ATH Soon?","Having surged about 22.5% over the past 30 days, Bitcoin (BTC) has sparked concerns in the crypto market that its rally may be nearing exhaustion, with a potential price correction on the horizon. However, the latest on-chain data reveals that despite elevated unrealized profits, there are still no signs of increased selling pressure for the leading cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Unrealized Profits Remain High But No Panic Selling Yet According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by Bitcoin analyst Crazzyblockk, the cohort of new investors – those who have held BTC for less than one month – is currently sitting on unrealized profits of 6.9%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near ATH, But Long-Term Holders Aren’t Selling – More Upside Ahead? In the same vein, short-term investors – holders who have held Bitcoin for less than six months – are sitting on unrealized profits of 10.7%. These figures highlight that the unrealized profit/loss ratio remains elevated, with unrealized profits far outweighing unrealized losses. Crazzyblockk noted that while historically, a high percentage of unrealized profits across the network tends to precede sharp price corrections, the current setup appears different. They added: Past cycles have shown that extreme profit concentration tends to precede volatility; however, current market structure shows no outsized concentration of risk in one participant group. The relatively narrow spread in unrealized profits between new and short-term holders indicates that profit distribution is balanced. Furthermore, although profit levels are high, loss levels remain compressed, suggesting limited pressure from distressed sellers. The contributor remarked: While macro conditions and volatility risk remain elevated, and a price correction cannot be ruled out, there is no strong behavioral signal suggesting a high willingness to trigger major distribution or selling. Further Upside For BTC? Meanwhile, seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently predicted further upside for Bitcoin. In a post on X, Martinez noted that BTC has undergone another bullish breakout, with the potential to reach a new all-time high (ATH) around $111,500. The current momentum has also drawn in retail investors. According to CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Aleman, wallets holding less than $10,000 worth of BTC are steadily returning to the market – a sign of growing retail participation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Cycle Indicator Hints At Bullish Breakout Ahead, Analyst Says That said, some warning signs may still dampen BTC’s current bullish trajectory. For instance, despite the recent encouraging price action, Bitcoin’s Demand Momentum remains subdued. Similarly, Bitcoin’s “supply scarcity” narrative still lacks meaningful strength, as Aleman recently stressed that despite depleting exchange reserves, BTC is not likely to face genuine supply scarcity in the near term. At press time, BTC trades at $106,528, up 1.8% in the past 24 hours.

SFM price dropped over 5 percent today despite the wider altcoin market following Bitcoin in bullish sentiment. A New York jury convicted Braden John Karony, a former CEO of the SafeMoon (SFM) crypto project, on all crucial charges earlier on Wednesday, May 21. Karony was charged by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) with conspiracy to commit securities fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering. The verdict was a result of a two-week trial that concluded that the ex-Safemoon executives defrauded SFM investors by draining purportedly locked liquidity for their personal gains. The case prosecutor alleged that Karony alongside Thomas Smith, a former Safemoon CTO, and Kyle Nagy, the project’s creator, misappropriated millions of investors’ funds between 2021 and 2022. While Smith has already pleaded guilty to all charges and testified against Karony, Nagy remains a fugitive, allegedly in Russia. Meanwhile, Karony will remain in police custody ahead of his sentencing, with his properties worth over $1.8 million seized. Market Impact on the Safemoon Project The Safemoon project has struggled to regain market share in the recent past following the indictment of the ex-officials. The project dropped in net valuation from nearly $1 billion to about $7.5 million at the time of this writing, according to our latest crypto oracle. Following the announcement on Wednesday, SFM price dropped over 4 percent in the past 24 hours to trade about $0.00002 during the late North American trading session. The Safemoon project has recorded sustained bearish sentiment in the recent past despite the wider altcoin market attempting to follow Bitcoin price in bullish sentiment. Furthermore, BTC price rallied over 4 percent in the past 24 hours to trade at about $109k, while the BNB and Dogecoin led in the wider altcoin recovery.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/new-york-jury-convicts-ex-safemoon-sfm-executive-on-all-charges/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","News",cryptocompare

Bitcoin, XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE Are Leading the New Cycle’s Charge","May 2025 is seeing a decisive shift in capital as whales and smart money accumulate select tokens. Bitcoin, XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are leading this trend, with on-chain data and analyst commentary confirming high-conviction buying. HBAR and Ethereum remain relevant, but the most notable accumulation is now concentrated in projects with clear upside and imminent catalysts. Bitcoin: Whales Quietly Accumulate Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $103,405, with whale addresses accumulating over 83,000 BTC between mid-April and mid-May 2025. Institutional confidence is rising as retail investors take profits, and forecasts for May call for an average BTC price of $119,798, with potential highs of $136,239 by month’s end. As Bitcoin’s momentum steadies above $100,000, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are drawing increased attention from growth-focused investors looking for the next major wave of upside. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF MAGACOIN FINANCE: Whale Activity and Early-Stage Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE has seen a surge in whale accumulation as its presale advances, with over $8 million raised and the price still under $0.001. The project’s scarcity-driven model—a capped 100 billion token supply, 45% allocated to presale, and Hashex-audited contracts—has made it one of the most dominant presales of 2025.

2025-05-21T22:26:44.000Z,"Ethereum Price Prediction: Bull Flag Points to $3,600 – But This One Indicator Could Push It to $5K","Ethereum (ETH) has gone up by nearly 1% in the past 24 hours and currently stands at $2,535 after a few days of relatively muted price action. The token’s post-Pectra rally encountered some selling pressure at the $2,750 level upon crossing the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) in the daily chart. Crypto trader Merlijn the Trader hinted at a bullish Ethereum price prediction on X as he spotted a ‘golden cross’ in the 12-hour chart. This is a bullish indicator that has recently produced strong gains in the near term for the top altcoin. The last Golden Cross sent $ETH flying. Now it’s flashing the same setup again. Ethereum to $3,000 is on the table. Ignore it at your own risk. pic.twitter.com/mHsrveBQiJ — Merlijn The Trader (@MerlijnTrader) May 20, 2025 Ethereum price forecasts have been revamped lately after the successful implementation of the network’s Pectra upgrade. This widely awaited revamp to the blockchain’s design has improved its efficiency and could make ETH a deflationary token as a portion of gas fees will now be burned to reduce its circulating supply. Ethereum Price Prediction: Bull Flag Breakout Could Result in 45% Gain for ETH Meanwhile, another continuation pattern has emerged in the past few days that could anticipate a bullish breakout that pushes ETH to at least $3,600. Flat patterns are known as high-probability technical setups that occur after the price has experienced a strong bullish or bearish movement. It indicates that the market is taking a pause to consolidate before resuming the previous move. In the case of ETH, this flag pattern has emerged after a robust uptrend that propelled the price from $1,800 to its current levels. If a bullish breakout occurs, which in this case means that the price breaks above the upper bound of the flag at $2,600, the expected price movement is often estimated using the size of the flag’s pole as a reference. For ETH, this means an upside potential of at least 45% that would take its price to $3,600 in the next few weeks. The pattern’s bullish bias would be confirmed if the breakout occurs in combination with high trading volumes. In addition, ETH could be about to deliver another strong buy signal as the 21-day EMA is nearing the 200-day EMA. If the former crosses above the latter, a bullish signal known as a ‘golden cross’ will be triggered and this could result in major gains for the token in a relatively short period as well. Like ETH, Bitcoin (BTC) has rallied above the $100,000 mark already. A new crypto presale called BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) is gearing up to automatically deliver rewards to token holders once the price hits $125,000. BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) Allows Bitcoin Investors to Generate Passive Income BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) delivers different types of rewards to token holders as Bitcoin hits new price milestones. Now that BTC has surpassed the $100,000 mark, the first of these milestones is closer than ever. The system is quite simple. For every $25,000 that BTC adds to its price, either a portion of BTCBULL’s circulating supply will be burned or token holders will receive a direct airdrop of Bitcoin tokens. With $6 million raised since the presale event was launched, the rewards pool has been fully funded to cover the first couple of milestone-based rewards. To buy $BTCBULL and start earning passive income from Bitcoin’s rally, head to the BTC Bull Token website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH or use a bank card to invest.

2025-05-21T22:23:15.000Z,"Here’s 5 Key Reasons Why BlackRock Isn’t Filing For XRP ETF Now!","The post Here’s 5 Key Reasons Why BlackRock Isn’t Filing For XRP ETF Now! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with AUM of $11.6 trillion, has been leading the charge with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, but when it comes to XRP, they seem to be in no rush. Despite growing interest and the recent launch of institutional futures, BlackRock hasn’t filed for an XRP ETF. So what’s holding them back? Let’s break it down. 1. Regulations Still Unclear The biggest reason is regulatory uncertainty. Even though a U.S. court ruled that XRP isn’t a security when traded on exchanges, the SEC hasn’t fully accepted this. In fact, ETF decisions continue to be pushed further, some now expected in June or even October 2025. BlackRock is known for playing it safe, they won’t file for an XRP ETF until regulators draw a clear line between securities and commodities in crypto. As one X user smartly pointed out, clarity might only come once major legislation, like the Stablecoin Act, is passed. 2. Derivatives Market Still Growing For big institutions, futures markets are a key tool for managing risk. While Bitcoin and Ethereum have mature futures markets with massive volume, XRP only just launched CME futures on May 19, 2025, with $19 million in first-day volume. That’s a strong start, but not enough yet. BlackRock and others want to see more consistent trading volume over time. 3. Liquidity Still Needs to Grow XRP has strong market depth, but for an ETF to function smoothly, it needs stable liquidity that can handle billions in inflows and outflows. Until XRP hits that level of maturity, ETF approval remains unlikely. 4. Focus on Winning Plays BlackRock is currently focused on its Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs , which are performing well. Rather than spreading its efforts thin, it’s doubling down on what’s working. 5. Strategic Timing Is Everything Finally, it could all come down to timing. With XRP and Solana leading ETF application discussions, BlackRock might be waiting to see how the SEC handles current filings before joining the race. It’s a waiting game for more demand, stronger liquidity, and a green light from regulators. So, while XRP fans might be eager, BlackRock is playing the long game.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/heres-5-key-reasons-why-blackrock-isnt-filing-for-xrp-etf-now/,"BTC|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP","News",cryptocompare

2025-05-21T22:09:18.000Z,"SEC Acknowledges the Amendment Proposal For BlackRock Ethereum ETF","The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has finally acknowledged an amendment in the spot Ethereum Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) filing submitted by BlackRock, a leading asset management firm. This marks a significant milestone for the firm and the broader cryptocurrency sector. In-cash Redemption Over In-kind Method For SEC ETF Approval BlackRock is not trying to submit a new spot ETH ETF application to the Commission. Rather, it is seeking to adjust the fund’s creation and redemption methods, which were launched in 2024. At inception, the BlackRock iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) was designed to accommodate in-kind redemption, but after going through the SEC’s desk, the firm was forced to choose the in-cash method instead. At the time, it did not look like BlackRock would have a chance of approval for the ETF if it did not make the suggested adjustments. One year after ETHA launched , precisely on May 10, it boldly filed for an amendment of the spot Ethereum ETF to allow an in-kind creation and redemption process. This coincides with the period when they discussed having Anchorage Digital as an additional Ethereum custodian . Benefits on In-kind Creation and Redemption of Ethereum ETF An in-kind approach allows authorized investors to exchange ETH for ETF shares during creation and redemption. These entities also get the exclusive advantage of sidestepping capital gains tax since they will not need to sell their ETH for cash. Cboe once proposed in-kind redemption for ARK 21Shares Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. In-kind creation and redemption in the Ethereum ETF have the potential to improve ETH price tracking while reducing trading fees. According to the document filed for the amendment, “This post-effective amendment No 1 to Form S-1 is being filed by the registrant to disclose that the Trust may allow for an in-kind creation and redemption process as an alternative to the Trust’s current cash creation and redemption process.” What Next? The US SEC has now opened the BlackRock ETHA amendment proposal filing for public comments. The agency usually takes this action before deciding on an application. The latest move from the SEC generally suggests that the regulator is actively working on the filing, although this does not guarantee that an approval will end the process.

In a new interview with Bloomberg, Novogratz says that many factors have contributed to the rise of digital assets, including President Donald Trump and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s embrace of the sector. “It started with Larry Fink. When he got orange-pilled, the largest asset manager in the world said ‘this is a real asset,’ at least Bitcoin, that everyone should be a part of and lots of other companies… followed suit. And that was kind of round one of institutions coming in. But really it was the shift of approach from the Gary Gensler SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) to this Trump Administration which has just embraced our industry, and that freed up the animal spirit, both here and abroad.” However, Novogratz goes on to say that America’s current uncertain fiscal situation is ultimately good for the top crypto asset by market cap and the digital assets industry in general. He says the Trump administration’s failure to significantly lower the debt-to-GDP ratio has been a boon for the asset class. “We’re in a really hard position as a country… We have this kind of debt, yield curves are selling off everywhere, the dollar is under pressure, and that all is very good for Bitcoin and crypto assets as well.” BTC is trading for $108,961 at time of writing, just below a new all-time high.

Investor sentiment has shifted decisively, reflecting institutional-style allocations,” she added. According to Google Trends, searches for Bitcoin have been trending down since November and are at lows typical of crypto bear markets, indicating a low retail interest in the cryptocurrency.Meanwhile, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which tracks market sentiment, was at a score of 72 out of 100 on May 22, indicating “greed.” The index is down from its 2025 high of 84 on Jan. 22, which came two days after Trump’s inauguration.Related: How high can Bitcoin price go?Edward Carroll, head of global markets and corporate finance at MHC Digital Group, told Cointelegraph in a note that growing demand driving the price higher in the medium-term could push Bitcoin to at least $160,000 by the fourth quarter of this year and $1 million by 2030.Trader’s leveraged Bitcoin bet tops $1.1BMeanwhile, leverage trader James Wynn’s Bitcoin long position on the crypto platform Hyperliquidity has become the largest onchain margin trade when it exceeded $1.1 billion amid Bitcoin’s price peak. The entry point for the 40x leveraged position was $108,065 and it has an unrealized profit of $20 million.

Special leave is required in an appeal to the High Court, and it’s only granted in cases where it would answer significant legal questions or matters of public interest.A Block Earner spokesperson told Cointelegraph the matter has now escalated to a “broader legal question” around the definition of a financial product, which extends “well beyond Block Earner, and the crypto sector.” “We believe the Full Federal Court’s April ruling was a strong and well-reasoned decision that upheld the integrity of our operations,” the spokesperson said. “We remain confident in the soundness of that judgment and will respond to ASIC’s application through the appropriate legal channels.” Legal saga ongoing since 2022ASIC first launched legal proceedings against Block Earner in November 2022, arguing the company needed a financial services license to offer its yield product which was available from March 17, 2022, until the company shut it down on Nov. 16, 2022.Related: Australia outlines crypto regulation plan, promises action on debankingASIC was arguing Block Earner needed a financial services license to offer its crypto-linked fixed-yield earning product.

The commissioner filling a Democratic seat at the financial regulator had served since March 2022 after being nominated by former President Joe Biden.In her farewell message, Johnson cited her work as a sponsor of the Market Risk Advisory Committee, which dealt with “nascent issues that arise with the introduction of decentralized financial products such as digital assets or cryptocurrency and other emerging markets.” CFTC Commissioner Kristin Johnson.

The steps include a new, trustless architecture, a native token, and the Seeker ship date.According to the announcement, Solana Mobile will ship the device starting Aug. 4. Seeker is the company’s second-generation device, after the Saga Web3 phone that launched in April 2023. The company unveiled the Seeker phone in September 2024, saying it wouldn’t just be a “memecoin phone.” So far, it has pre-sold 150,000 units.The Solana Seeker has gone through two sale phases: The Founder window, where the price for each device was $450, and the Early Adopter window, where the price per device was $500. Assuming the lower price window, Solana Mobile could generate at least $67.5 million in gross revenue from device sales. For comparison, the iPhone generated $199.3 billion in revenue for Apple in 2024.The new architecture that will govern future Solana Mobile devices is called TEEPIN, which stands for “Trusted Execution Environment Platform Infrastructure Network.” It is a three-layer architecture — hardware, platform, and network layers — that will allow users, developers, and device makers to participate in a trustless environment.Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder and CEO of Solana Labs, called TEEPIN “the next evolution in mobile” and a framework where trust is “verified by cryptography.”In addition, Solana Mobile is planning to launch “SKR,” the native asset of the Solana Mobile ecosystem. \""It transforms the traditional mobile business model by giving stakeholders actual ownership in the platform,” said Emmett Hollyer, general manager at Solana Mobile. Related: Solana lacks ‘convincing signs’ of besting Ethereum: SygnumSolana Saga Solana Mobile’s first released device, Saga, initially elicited mixed reactions from the Web3 community — some hailed it as Web3’s “iPhone moment,” while others pointed to the network’s outages as a drawback. The Saga phone didn’t take off until late 2023, when a surge in the value of memecoins stored on the devices turned them into unexpected profit machines. Some units were listed on eBay for thousands of dollars, driven by growing demand.

From a broad perspective, the $77 billion in Bitcoin futures open interest has undoubtedly played a role. However, a closer look at the data shows a more positive outlook for further price gains.Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.chThe current 7% annualized Bitcoin futures premium is well within the neutral range of 5% to 10%, which has been typical for the past two weeks. This indicator can easily exceed 30% during periods of strong optimism, so the current level is relatively low. At the same time, the absence of excessive leverage reduces concerns about a rally driven primarily by derivatives.Balanced order books and spot Bitcoin ETF inflows point to spot-driven rallyFor comparison, during the previous Bitcoin $109,346 all-time high on Jan. 20, the annualized futures premium reached 15%, showing a much higher level of leveraged bullish positions affecting the price. Therefore, the current Bitcoin derivatives market appears healthier, suggesting strong demand in spot markets.During the January bull run, Bitcoin’s price on Coinbase traded at a premium compared to other exchanges. This so-called Coinbase premium is not present now, which means buying pressure is more evenly spread out—a sign of a healthier market.Coinbase Bitcoin/USD relative to competitors. Source: TradingView / CointelegraphWhile excessive buying pressure on a single exchange is not necessarily bearish, it can make it easier to trigger unsustainable price surges when liquidity is low. This data supports the idea that derivatives markets were not the main driver of the recent price increases. Moreover, the $1.37 billion in net inflows to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States between May 15 and May 20 further suggests that spot buyers, rather than derivatives traders, were the primary force behind the rally.Despite the lack of conviction in Bitcoin futures, several indicators point to further upside. Forced liquidations of bearish BTC futures positions were relatively low at $170 million between May 18 and May 21, cementing the idea of a spot-driven rally. In comparison, the rally to $104,000 on May 9 triggered $538 million in liquidations over three days.Related: Is Bitcoin price close to a cycle top? — 5 indicators that help traders decideBitcoin options put-to-call ratio at Deribit.

For comparison, the put-to-call ratio at Deribit dropped to 0.4x during the previous bull run on Jan. 20, reflecting lower confidence due to reduced volumes in call (buy) options.Bitcoin’s upward movement may have been limited by macroeconomic factors, especially as the tariff war continues. Still, the potential for the price to reach $110,000 and higher is partly based on the weak position of the US Federal Reserve.

A break below the 20-day EMA will be the first sign that the bulls are booking profits in a hurry. That increases the risk of a break below the psychological support of $100,000. Ether price predictionBuyers are trying to sustain Ether (ETH) above the $2,550 level but are facing significant resistance from the bears.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping 20-day EMA ($2,334) and the RSI near the overbought zone indicate that buyers are in control. The ETH/USDT pair is likely to pick up momentum on a break above $2,739. That clears the path for a rally to $3,000.Contrary to this assumption, a break and close below the 20-day EMA signals that the bears are back in the game. The pair could tumble to $2,111, which is likely to attract solid buying by the bulls.XRP price predictionXRP (XRP) has been witnessing a tough battle between the buyers and sellers at the 20-day EMA ($2.35).XRP/USDT daily chart.

If the price skids below the 20-day EMA, the XRP/USDT pair may stay inside the $2 to $2.65 range for a while. Instead, if the price turns up sharply from the 20-day EMA and breaks above $2.65, the advantage will tilt in favor of the bulls. The pair could rally to $3 and, after that, to $3.40, where the sellers are expected to mount a strong defense.BNB price predictionBNB (BNB) bulls have held the 20-day EMA ($639) support during the pullback, indicating buying on dips. BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bulls will try to push the price above $693 but are expected to face solid selling by the bears.

That could sink the pair to the 50-day SMA ($609). Solana price predictionSellers failed to pull Solana (SOL) below the 20-day EMA ($164), indicating demand at lower levels.SOL/USDT daily chart.

The pair could slide to $153 and later to the 50-day SMA ($145). That suggests a possible range-bound action between $120 and $180.Dogecoin price predictionDogecoin (DOGE) has bounced off the breakout level of $0.21, indicating that buyers are active at lower levels.DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe 20-day EMA ($0.21) is trending up, and the RSI is in the positive zone, signaling that buyers are in command.

If the price turns down sharply from the overhead resistance, the pair could form a narrow range between $0.26 and $0.21 for some time.Contrarily, a break and close above $0.26 signals the start of the next leg of the up move.

2025-05-21T17:55:00.000Z,"Interest groups, lawmakers to protest Trump&#039;s memecoin dinner","Democratic leaning organizations and members of Congress have announced plans to protest what they describe as the sale of access to the office of the US president, in reference to Donald Trump’s memecoin dinner on May 22. The event’s attendees are said to have collectively spent over $100 million for the chance to meet with the US president.Since Trump’s memecoin project, Official Trump (TRUMP), announced that its top 220 tokenholders would have an opportunity to apply for an exclusive dinner with the president, many leaders in the crypto industry and US lawmakers have criticized the event, saying Trump was opening his office to potential bribery and corruption. The memecoin dinner prompted some Democratic lawmakers to withdraw support for crypto-related legislation in Congress, including the market structure and stablecoin bills.“Trump collecting gifts from foreign governments is unconstitutional,” a spokesperson for the consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen, which is planning to protest near the memecoin dinner on May 22, told Cointelegraph. “Collecting foreign government investments through his memecoin is not much better. American foreign policy should not be for sale.”Source: Public CitizenCrypto industry figures such as Tron founder Justin Sun, Kronos Research chief investment officer Vincent Liu, Hyperithm co-CEO Oh Sangrok, and Synthetix founder Kain Warwick are among the tokenholders expected to attend the dinner at the Trump National Golf Club outside Washington, DC. The memecoin project said all applicants had to pass a background check and could not be from a “[Know Your Customer] watchlist country.”Related: Democrats seek suspicious activity reports linked to Trump crypto venturesPublic Citizen, in partnership with progressive political organization Our Revolution, will hold a rally near the golf club, which Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley is expected to attend. In addition, the Arlington and Loudoun Democrats will be hosting a separate event to urge US officials to “hold [Trump] accountable,” and Democratic leadership in Congress has scheduled two press events on May 22 ahead of the dinner.“Americans cannot and will not accept President Trump’s view that positions of power exist only to benefit the holder of that power,” Ryan Ruzic, chair of the Loudoun County Democratic Committee, told Cointelegraph. “We have a moral responsibility to speak out against corruption, whatever the result may be.”Pushback on TRUMP memecoin affected crypto legislationSome lawmakers initially cited the memecoin dinner and the Trump family’s involvement with the crypto platform World Liberty Financial in opposing passage of the GENIUS Act, a bill to regulate payment stablecoins. World Liberty Financial began issuing its own USD1 stablecoin in March, prompting concerns about Trump’s conflicts of interest. However, the legislation passed a key procedural vote in the Senate on May 19 with support from Democrats, setting the bill up for debate in the chamber.“Many senators, myself included, have very real concerns about the Trump family’s use of crypto technologies to evade oversight, hide shady financial dealings, and personally profit at the expense of everyday Americans,” said Sen. Mark Warner in a statement before the May 19 vote, adding: “But we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay.”Senator Chris Murphy, who voted against advancing the GENIUS Act, called for bipartisan support in amending the bill to specifically bar a US president from issuing stablecoins. He also called on the White House to release a complete list of attendees to the memecoin dinner, suggesting that some or all of them would “try to get something from the president” in exchange for purchasing the tokens. Murphy and Senator Elizabeth Warren will attend a press event with representatives for Public Citizen on May 22. California Representative Maxine Waters, ranking member of the US House Financial Services Committee, announced a separate press conference for the same day, with plans to introduce a bill to “block Trump’s memecoin and stop his crypto corruption, once and for all.”As of May 21, the exact number of attendees to the dinner was unknown. A smaller group of 25 tokenholders also qualified to apply for “VIP tour” and reception — presumably at the White House — with Trump, but the complete list of those planning to attend was also unknown at the time of publication.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/protest-donald-trump-memecoin-dinner?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

For many, this could be the long-awaited climax of the past four years, and major players are preparing accordingly.Since late 2024, Bitcoin whale accumulation has surged. Glassnode data shows that the number of addresses holding over 100 BTC has jumped by almost 14%, reaching 18,200 — a level not seen since 2017. The biggest market players appear to be positioning for what could be this cycle’s final run-up.Number of BTC addresses holding over 100 BTC. Source: GlassnodeHowever, riding the rally is trickier than it looks and knowing when to exit is notoriously difficult. The lure of higher price highs fuels FOMO, driving investors to buy the top, only to face painful drawdowns or even liquidations.So, how can traders and investors spot the top before the market enters recession?Bitcoin cycle top markersSeveral technical and onchain indicators, such as MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Z-score, Pi Cycle Top, and trading volume trends, have historically been reliable in signaling when Bitcoin is nearing its peak.The MVRV-Z score compares Bitcoin’s market value to its realized value and adjusts for volatility. A high Z-score suggests Bitcoin is significantly overvalued relative to its historical cost basis. When this indicator is at a historical high, the ensuing downward trend in Bitcoin prices is likely.The Pi Cycle Top tracks BTC price dynamics using moving averages. When the 111-day moving average (111-SMA) crosses above twice the 350-day average (350-SMAx2), it signals overheating. In other words, when the short-term trend catches up to the long-term trajectory, a market top is in.Historically, all previous Bitcoin bull runs started with a notable surge in MVRV Z-score, and ended with 111-SMA crossing the longer-term trend.BTC: Pi Cycle Top + MVRV Z-score. Source: Marie Poteriaieva, GlassnodeAdditionally, lower trading volumes during price increases can be a warning sign, often signaling weakening momentum and potential for a reversal. On-balance volume (OBV), which registers cumulative volume flow, is a valuable metric for tracking this process. When OBV diverges from the price action, it is often an early reversal signal. The second leg of the 2021 bull run was a great example. While BTC price was hitting higher highs of $68,000 (compared to the previous all-time high of $63,170), trading volumes moved in a different direction, decreasing from 710,000 BTC to 628,000 BTC. This created a bearish divergence between price and volume, suggesting that fewer market participants were supporting the rally — a classic sign of waning momentum.BTC/USD 1-day, OBV.

Some valuable metrics that can track it are the Puell Multiple and exchange flows.The Puell Multiple Indicator looks at miners' revenue relative to its 365-day average.

In a May 21 social media post that begins with, “The Empire Lobbies Back,” Campbell claimed that the banking industry is especially alarmed by the potential for stablecoins to offer interest or rewards to holders. In a pointed message aimed at Democratic lawmakers, Campbell wrote that “banks want you to protect their cartel so they can keep screwing your voters.” He went on to explain how fractional reserve banking enables banks to maximize profits while offering depositors minimal interest.The banking lobby says that if stablecoins pay interest or any other type of monetary reward, banks will be “harmed,” Campbell added.An excerpt of Campbell’s X post.

In line with its current trajectory, 21st Capital co-founder Sina noted that Bitcoin is approaching a pivotal moment around the $108,000 level. The Bitcoin Quantile Model update shows that BTC’s market reflects the same “heat” that was present after President Trump’s post-election rally and the spot ETF-driven highs during Q4 2024. The model, which uses quantile regression to map Bitcoin’s price phases on a logarithmic scale, indicates the cryptocurrency is in the Transition Zone, a critical juncture before the Acceleration Phase. Throughout Q4, 2024, Bitcoin rallied by 45% after entering a price discovery period above $74,500. Bitcoin Quantile Model. Source: X.comAs illustrated in the chart, once it breaks into the \""Acceleration\"" Phase, it could trigger BTC’s next leg or the mid-phase, typically between the 33% and 66% range. Based on the model, BTC is expected to progressively target price levels of $130,000 and $163,000 in the coming months. However, anonymous Bitcoin analyst apsk32 believed a price target above $200,000 is a “reasonable” expectation for 2025. Basing the projection on Bitcoin’s “power curve,” the analyst noted that BTC’s position relative to gold has significantly improved since April. From a technical standpoint, this view is supported by the recent convergence of the Sharpe ratios for Bitcoin and gold, suggesting that the two hard assets now offer comparable risk-to-reward profiles to their investors. Fidelity’s Director of Global Macro Jurrien Timmer shed light on this development, recommending a 4:1 goal-to-Bitcoin ratio from an allocation perspective. Related: Bitcoin 'blow-off top' set at $128K with new all-time highs in sightStrong Bitcoin volumes “final straw” before new highs Crypto researcher Aylo analyzed BTC’s historical price action when the crypto asset consolidates near its all-time high level. In an X post, the analyst explained, “The data shows when BTC gets close to its previous ATH during a strong, accelerating trend with high momentum, it has historically broken out to new ATHs within a short time (days to weeks).”However, weaker trends have led to stalls or retraces between March and May 2024. Currently, Bitcoin exhibits a strong trend but lacks the necessary trading volume, which remains the final straw to confirm a breakout, a factor that could delay upward movement.Alyo added that for Bitcoin to break its all-time highs, daily trading volume should exceed the previous 10 days, be at least 1.5 times the 20-day average, and ideally sustain a 3-day increase while the price holds steady or rises.Data from CryptoQuant has reinforced Aylo’s concerns about trading volume.

2025-05-21T15:00:00.000Z,"How to handle crypto trading gains and losses on your balance sheet","Key takeawaysProperly accounting for crypto assets on your balance sheet is essential for accurate tax reporting and financial transparency.Crypto trading activities should be recorded like stock trading, at fair market value on the day of purchase.In some countries, like the US, crypto losses can offset gains, so keeping track of gains and losses is important for reducing taxable income.Whether you’re an individual investor or a business, treating cryptocurrencies as assets and documenting them ensures compliance with tax laws and minimizes the risk of errors.Let’s be real, it’s easy to lose sight of what you’ve actually gained or lost, especially when it comes to crypto and its market volatility and frequent trading activities. And when it comes to accounting, especially in countries like the United States, it gets trickier because you must reflect those numbers properly on your balance sheet. If you are running a business that involves crypto or you are just a crypto investor, understanding how to account for your digital assets correctly is crucial. This guide breaks down the basics of balance sheets, handling crypto gains and losses, and what tax implications you need to account for.What is a balance sheet, and why is it needed?Think of a balance sheet as a report of your financial health. It shows what you own, owe and what’s left over at a specific point in time. It contains three main parts: Assets: What the company owns, such as cash, crypto, real estate, inventory, etc.Liabilities: What the company owes, such as loans, unpaid bills and taxesEquity: What’s left after subtracting liabilities from assets (net worth).For example, if you own $50,000 worth of crypto, and at the same time, you owe someone $20,000. In this case, your equity is $30,000. Balance sheets help you understand your financial position at a glance. They’re essential for filing taxes, attracting investors, applying for loans and complying with regulations. Balance sheets are essential in countries like the United States, where businesses must report crypto holdings accurately for tax and compliance reasons. Similarly, in the UK, European countries and Canada, balance sheets are important for businesses and are often used by individuals, especially when dealing with crypto assets. It’s not just for taxes. A well-maintained balance sheet can help you get funding, plan your finances, or simply sleep better knowing where you stand at night.How do you treat crypto on a balance sheet?One of the most common questions when preparing a balance sheet is, “How to report crypto trading gains and losses on a balance sheet?” In most jurisdictions, the crypto reporting and taxation rules are still to be decided or clarified. This also applies to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which lack definitive guidance concerning cryptocurrency accounting.As cryptocurrencies are considered assets in many jurisdictions, the fundamental concepts of accounting for assets could apply when preparing a balance sheet involving crypto transactions. Below is an example of a simplified crypto balance sheet treatment and some helpful pointers that may assist you in accounting for crypto trading in 2025.Notes to the balance sheet:Cash ($15,000): Represents fiat currency (e.g., USD) held in bank accounts or wallets, including proceeds from selling crypto or other revenue.Cryptocurrency ($20,000): Recorded at cost basis (fair market value at acquisition, less any impairment). Includes 0.5 Bitcoin (BTC) purchased at $30,000 each ($15,000 total) and 10 Ether (ETH) purchased at $500 each ($5,000 total). No impairment has been recorded, assuming the fair market value (FMV) remains above cost.Mining equipment ($5,000): Capitalized cost of crypto mining hardware, net of depreciation. The original cost was $8,000, with $3,000 accumulated depreciation over two years.Accounts payable ($2,000): Unpaid bills (e.g., for electricity or supplier services related to crypto mining operations).Taxes payable ($1,500): Estimated tax liability for realized crypto gains (e.g., from selling 0.1 BTC at a $2,000 gain, taxed at 20% long-term capital gains rate for simplicity).Retained earnings ($36,500): Accumulated profits, including crypto-related income (e.g., mining revenue, realized gains) minus expenses and taxes. Reflects net income from prior and current periods.When buying cryptocurrency with fiat moneyWhen you buy cryptocurrency with fiat money, such as dollars or euros, you’re simply exchanging one type of asset, such as cash, for another, like crypto or stocks. On your balance sheet, cryptocurrency trading activities should be recorded similarly to those of stock trading activities. As with stocks, you should record cryptocurrency on your balance sheet at its fair market value on the day of purchase. While your cash account displays a credit for the same amount, the cryptocurrency is recorded as a debit to your assets account.When selling cryptocurrency for fiat moneySelling crypto for fiat creates a change in your balance sheet: Your crypto holdings will be reduced, meaning credited, and your cash will increase, which also means that the account will be credited.If you sell for more than you paid (the original price of a token), you have a gain; if you sell for less, you record a loss. Both crypto gains and crypto losses should be tracked carefully for tax and reporting purposes.How to record crypto lossesThe difference is recorded as a loss when you sell crypto at a lower price than you bought it for. In some countries, these losses can lower your taxable income, so it can prove useful to properly document them.  However, even if the asset regains its previous price levels, impairment losses cannot be undone in accordance with GAAP’s accounting rules for intangible assets.This contrasts with IFRS, where certain intangible assets can be revalued upward under IAS 38 if an active market exists. However, crypto markets are volatile, and IFRS guidance on crypto revaluation remains unclear, so most entities stick to cost-less impairment. Businesses should consult local accounting standards and auditors for precise treatment.How to record crypto profitsIf you receive cryptocurrency as payment for goods, services or other activities, it’s treated as income at the fair market value on the date you receive it. This value is recorded as revenue and added to your assets. Later, if you sell or swap the crypto, any difference in value will result in a capital gain or loss.How to record crypto mining When cryptocurrency mining income occurs, it should be reported at the currency’s fair market value. This revenue should be shown on your income statement since it increases your assets.Similar to other revenue-generating activities, companies engaged in cryptocurrency mining are required to report their crypto profits on their balance sheet. Their mining income account will be credited as a result. Subsequently, the newly generated digital asset has to be recorded in their accounts at its fair market value.Additionally, costs related to mining operations should be recorded. For example, the cash account needs to be credited if cash is spent to cover mining costs. The purchase of mining equipment, which requires capitalization and amortization, will subsequently be deducted from the associated asset account or otherwise documented as a cost for items like utilities and supplies.Using cryptocurrency to pay suppliersPaying suppliers or vendors with cryptocurrency is like selling the asset since you have to recognize any gain or loss in relation to its original value. Therefore, the difference between the asset’s book value and its expense will be recorded as a capital gain.How to record transaction fees and exchange rates It’s critical to keep track of transaction costs and exchange rate fluctuations when trading or exchanging cryptocurrencies. Fees should be shown as an expense on the balance sheet since they lower your net gain or increase your loss. Changes in exchange rates may also have an impact on the value recorded when converting cryptocurrency into fiat, which could have an effect on your taxes and capital gains.Did you know? Cryptocurrency held for more than a year can be categorized as a long-term asset on your balance sheet in some jurisdictions, which may result in better tax treatment than short-term holdings.How are cryptocurrencies taxed?Taxation of cryptocurrencies varies by country, but your balance sheet plays a crucial role in tracking taxable events. Under current GAAP, crypto is recorded at cost and tested for impairment. IFRS allows revaluation in rare cases, but most entities use the cost model. For traders holding crypto as inventory, GAAP (ASC 330) or IFRS (IAS 2) may apply, with FMV adjustments. The lack of definitive guidance means businesses must apply judgment and document assumptions clearly. In the US, crypto is treated as property, with taxes applied to capital gains when selling or trading. The Internal Revenue Service requires reporting on your balance sheet; losses can offset gains. Also, the US introduced Form 1099-DA in 2025 for crypto brokers to report transactions, increasing compliance requirements. In the UK, cryptocurrencies are taxed under capital gains for individuals, while income tax may apply if trading is frequent or when crypto is received as income, such as through mining, staking or as payment for services.Canada follows a similar approach, taxing crypto as capital gains (50% inclusion rate) or business income for active traders. Mining income is taxable as income.In Germany, long-term holders (over a year) pay no tax on capital gains, but short-term trades over 600 euros are taxed. Notably, the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation (effective 2024) standardizes crypto reporting, impacting balance sheet documentation in member states.Accounting for Ethereum transactionsEthereum, the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts, has unique accounting needs. Here’s how to handle common Ethereum transactions on your balance sheet:Staking rewards: Staking ETH on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network generates rewards, treated as income at FMV when received. For example, receiving 0.1 ETH as a staking reward debits your “Cryptocurrency” asset account and credits “Revenue” on your income statement. Selling staked ETH later triggers a capital gain or loss.Gas fees: Ethereum transactions incur gas fees, which are expenses. Record these as a debit to “Transaction Fees” (an expense account) and a credit to “Cash” or “Cryptocurrency” if paid in ETH. For example, a $50 gas fee paid in ETH reduces your ETH holdings and is expensed.DeFi transactions: Yield farming or liquidity provision (e.g., on Uniswap) generates rewards, treated as income at FMV when received. For example, earning 100 UNI (UNI) tokens ($1,000) debits “Cryptocurrency” and credits “Revenue.” Track gas fees and token swaps as expenses or taxable events.ERC-20 tokens: Ethereum-based tokens (e.g., USDC, LINK) are separate assets. Record each at its FMV at acquisition, like ETH, and track them individually to avoid confusion.Accurate tracking of Ethereum transactions ensures compliance, especially with increased IRS scrutiny on staking and DeFi in 2025.Tools and best practices for crypto accountingManaging crypto transactions can be daunting, but these tools and tips simplify the process:Accounting software: Use platforms like CoinTracker, Koinly or CryptoTaxCalculator to track Ethereum transactions, calculate gains/losses, and generate tax reports. These tools integrate with wallets and exchanges, ensuring accurate FMV records.Regular reconciliation: Match your balance sheet’s crypto holdings to wallet/exchange records monthly to catch errors, especially for gas fees or staking rewards.Work with professionals: Crypto tax rules, especially for Ethereum’s DeFi and staking, are complex. Consult a crypto-savvy accountant to ensure compliance with IRS, His Majesty’s Revenue & Customs or other regulations.Document everything: Keep records of every Ethereum transaction, including FMV, gas fees and staking rewards, to prepare for audits or Form 1099-DA reporting in 2025.By staying organized, you’ll minimize errors and stress when filing taxes or preparing financial statements.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-trading-gains-and-losses-on-balance-sheet?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-21T15:00:00.000Z,"Crypto&#039;s real momentum isn&#039;t in the charts; it&#039;s in developer activity","Opinion by: Markus Levin, co-founder of XYOThe crypto community often experiences periods of heightened anxiety. Market downturns are often triggered by counterproductive sentiment-driven events rather than by fundamental issues, creating a significant disconnect between price behavior and the actual progress being made within the industry by the companies within it. What often goes unnoticed is how much real development happens during these downturns. While market movements capture most of the attention, teams are building faster and more deliberately behind the scenes than ever. The focus shifts away from price speculation and toward real execution. Growth happens during downturns. It's a necessary phase for projects that thrive in a volatile industry. They re-focus attention on refining their technology and business, fueling the next wave of progress.As a result, there's a disconnect between online sentiment and conversations between blockchain industry leaders. For builders and project leaders, the atmosphere is of determination, not doom.Regulators are coming on boardOne of the most promising developments is the accelerating momentum of regulation policy. Many European companies are applying for MiCA licenses in preparation for regulatory updates. There's also a significant policy shift under new US leadership as the SEC retreats from several high-profile crypto enforcement actions. The disparity between sentiment and reality serves as a reminder that price is a lagging indicator. Selloffs are triggered by uncertainty around tariff announcements and background activity such as interest rates. Material, long-term statistics speak for the virtually universal optimism among industry leaders as the number of active developers has remained stable, and the number of established developers almost doubled last year. That's an incredible jump in only one year. From hype to substanceMaturation means teams thoughtfully building, governments engaging seriously with legislation, and users demanding better UX and real utility. The industry has a well-established pattern — market corrections wipe away hype and encourage focus. The last bear market gave rise to breakthroughs in DeFi, NFTs, and zero-knowledge tech. This time, it's about real-world infrastructure, regulation-ready platforms, and next-gen scalability.What emerges in these periods tends to be less visible but more durable. Teams that remain active are often those with clear models, sufficient runway, and a willingness to adapt. These are the periods when we learn whether the systems being built can handle real-world demands. One of the most promising frontiers lies at the intersection of AI and blockchain, the most ubiquitous being within Large Language Models. AI is, however, only as good as the data it's trained on.AI systems are evolving rapidly, but their foundations are skewed. They're built primarily on data scraped from the digital-first countries that predominantly lie in the northern hemisphere, which dominates global media production and internet usage. This creates a feedback loop where Western and East Asian perspectives and widely spoken languages such as English and Mandarin are not only amplified but leave little room for necessary data from smaller populations.A report from Web3 Technologies said 60% of tier-one media on the internet is English. Prominent among these media outlets is The New York Times, which has sued OpenAI based on copyright infringement. The publication alleges that their copyright-protected data was used to train OpenAI's LLM model. Recent: The future of finance is built on Bitcoin — Ethereum was just the testnetKnowing the full extent of the global imbalance in the data creating AI outputs is impossible. Allegations like this and the results delivered when using AI tools suggest the pressing need for a solution.It's even worse. When AI systems are trained on narrow, incomplete data sets, the results can exclude billions from the benefits of emerging technologies. As IBM highlights, data bias isn't just a technical issue — it's a human one with real-world consequences in healthcare, finance, agriculture, and beyond.It's become normal to use AI data every day. We receive personalized Google search results, Adobe has built AI into its industry-standard graphic and video software, and we use AI assistants like Gemini, Grok, and ChatGPT to formulate the thoughts with which we represent ourselves. All of these tools are affected by an overwhelming bias toward the center of a bell curve within their data sets, unable to access or address less common use cases.A popular example demonstrates this issue: Until recently, image generators could not create a full wine glass. No matter what prompt you provided, a wine glass full to the edge was beyond the capabilities of all known generative AI software because they had never been provided photos of wine glasses full to the brim. Their data sets had to be updated to correct this comical problem, which revealed a much more serious one.Decentralized data offers a solution. Globally incentivized systems like DePINs enable the participation of populations that would otherwise remain underserved, allowing the valuable data they provide to come online. This improves the service for everyone, making smaller global communities more accessible to commerce and enabling them easier access to the rest of the world. It also empowers smaller data creators to monetize their data rather than relinquishing it to tech giants. Where do we go from here?The crypto industry is entering a new phase. A phase that's more productive and sustainable. Expect to see rapid growth in working infrastructure, platforms and applications that welcome knowledgeable, consumer-friendly regulations and projects that respect the time and money of their users.Opportunities within the crypto space are changing but not shrinking. Our opportunities grow as we learn from what has not worked in the last few years. They will take time to develop, but successful builders will focus on long-term, incremental change and sound business practices rather than chasing fads and short-term profits.The momentum of real progress has never been stronger, and it is precisely during times like these, when it feels like no one's watching, that the foundations of the future are laid.Opinion by: Markus Levin, co-founder of XYO.

2025-05-21T14:00:55.000Z,"AI tool claims 97% efficacy in preventing ‘address poisoning’ attacks","Crypto cybersecurity firm Trugard and onchain trust protocol Webacy have developed an artificial intelligence-based system for detecting crypto wallet address poisoning.According to a May 21 announcement shared with Cointelegraph, the new tool is part of Webacy’s crypto decisioning tools and “leverages a supervised machine learning model trained on live transaction data in conjunction with onchain analytics, feature engineering and behavioral context.” The new tool purportedly has a success score of 97%, tested across known attack cases. “Address poisoning is one of the most underreported yet costly scams in crypto, and it preys on the simplest assumption: That what you see is what you get,” said Webacy co-founder Maika Isogawa.Address poisoning detection infographic. Source: Trugard and WebacyCrypto address poisoning is a scam where attackers send small amounts of cryptocurrency from a wallet address that closely resembles a target’s real address, often with the same starting and ending characters. The goal is to trick the user into accidentally copying and reusing the attacker’s address in future transactions, resulting in lost funds.The technique exploits how users often rely on partial address matching or clipboard history when sending crypto. A January 2025 study found that over 270 million poisoning attempts occurred on BNB Chain and Ethereum between July 1, 2022, and June 30, 2024. Of those, 6,000 attempts were successful, leading to losses over $83 million.Related: What are address poisoning attacks in crypto and how to avoid them?Web2 security in a Web3 worldTrugard chief technology officer Jeremiah O’Connor told Cointelegraph that the team brings deep cybersecurity expertise from the Web2 world, which they’ve been “applying to Web3 data since the early days of crypto.” The team is applying its experience with algorithmic feature engineering from traditional systems to Web3. He added:“Most existing Web3 attack detection systems rely on static rules or basic transaction filtering. These methods often fall behind evolving attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures.“The newly developed system instead leverages machine learning to create a system that learns and adapts to address poisoning attacks. O’Connor highlighted that what sets their system apart is “its emphasis on context and pattern recognition.” Isogawa explained that “AI can detect patterns often beyond the reach of human analysis.”Related: Jameson Lopp sounds alarm on Bitcoin address poisoning attacksThe machine learning approachO’Connor said Trugard generated synthetic training data for the AI to simulate various attack patterns. Then the model was trained through supervised learning, a type of machine learning where a model is trained on labeled data, including input variables and the correct output.In such a setup, the goal is for the model to learn the relationship between inputs and outputs to predict the correct output for new, unseen inputs. Common examples include spam detection, image classification and price prediction.O’Connor said the model is also updated by training it on new data as new strategies emerge. “To top it off, we’ve built a synthetic data generation layer that lets us continuously test the model against simulated poisoning scenarios,” he said. “This has proven incredibly effective in helping the model generalize and stay robust over time.“Magazine: Crypto-Sec: Phishing scammer goes after Hedera users, address poisoner gets $70K",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-system-has-97-claimed-efficacy-in-preventing-address-poisoning-attacks?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

After failing to gain support from key Democrats on May 8, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act passed the US Senate in a 66–32 procedural vote on May 20 and is now heading to a debate on the Senate floor.The bill seeks to set clear rules for stablecoin collateralization and mandate compliance with Anti-Money Laundering laws.Related: German gov’t missed out on $2.3B profit after selling Bitcoin at $57K“This act doesn’t just regulate stablecoins, it legitimizes them,” said Andrei Grachev, managing partner at DWF Labs and Falcon Finance.“It sets clear rules, and with clarity comes confidence.

Pendle now accounts for 30% of all yield-bearing stablecoin total value locked (TVL), roughly $3 billion, the firm said in a report shared with Cointelegraph.  Pendle noted that stablecoins make up 83% of its $4 billion total value locked, a sharp rise from less than 20% just a year ago. In contrast, assets such as Ether (ETH), which historically contributed 80–90% of Pendle’s TVL, have shrunk to less than 10% of its TVL.Traditional stablecoins like USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC) do not pass on interest to holders.

2025-05-21T08:38:10.000Z,"SEC’s Peirce says NFT royalties do not make tokens securities","United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Hester Peirce said many non-fungible tokens (NFTs), including those with mechanisms to pay creator royalties, likely fall outside the purview of federal securities laws.In a recent speech, Peirce said NFTs that allow artists to earn resale revenue do not automatically qualify as securities. Unlike stocks, NFTs are programmable assets that distribute proceeds to developers or artists. The SEC official said that mirrors how streaming platforms compensate musicians and filmmakers. “Just as streaming platforms pay royalties to the creator of a song or video each time a user plays it, an NFT can enable artists to benefit from the appreciation in the value of their work after its initial sale,” Peirce said. Peirce added that the feature does not provide NFT owners any rights or interest in any business enterprise or profits “traditionally associated with securities.”SEC never prohibited NFT royaltiesOscar Franklin Tan, chief legal officer of Enjin core contributor Atlas Development Services, told Cointelegraph that the recent remarks by Peirce on NFTs and creator royalties have been widely misunderstood. Peirce had clarified that NFTs that send resale royalties to artists are not necessarily securities, a view Tan says is legally sound but mischaracterized in some media reports. “So Hester Peirce said that an NFT that sends royalties back to the creator after a sale is not a security. This is correct, but the way some media reported this is completely out of context,” Tan told Cointelegraph. “The actual context is that this is not controversial, and it was never considered a security.”The lawyer said US securities law focuses on regulating investments and not compensating creators for their work. “The artist or creator is not an investor, not a passive third party in the NFT,” he said, noting that royalty payments are not considered investment income. Instead, Tan told Cointelegraph that this type of earning is “analogous to business income,” which the SEC does not regulate. He added: “The SEC never prohibited contracts where artists and creators get royalties from secondary sales of their work, not royalties from paper contracts or blockchain protocols.”Tan explained that the legal distinction becomes more complicated when NFTs promise shared profits from royalties to multiple holders beyond the original creator. Tan also urged regulators and market participants to apply traditional legal reasoning to new blockchain technologies. “Ask yourself, if this were done by pen and paper instead of blockchain, would there still be a regulatory issue?” he said. “If none, slow down.”Source: Oscar Franklin TanRelated: SEC charges Unicoin crypto platform over alleged $100 million fraudOpenSea calls on the SEC to exempt NFT marketplaces from oversightWhile NFT royalties may not have been a controversial SEC issue, NFT marketplaces are a different case. In August 2024, NFT trading platform OpenSea received a Wells notice from the SEC, alleging that NFTs traded on the marketplace could qualify as unregistered securities. On Feb. 22, OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer announced that the SEC has officially closed its investigation into the platform. The executive said that this was a win for the industry. Following the conclusion of the SEC’s investigation, OpenSea’s lawyers penned a letter to Peirce, who leads the SEC’s Crypto Task Force. OpenSea general counsel Adele Faure and deputy general counsel Laura Brookover said in an April 9 letter that NFT marketplaces don’t qualify as brokers under US securities laws. The lawyers said the marketplaces don’t execute transactions or act as intermediaries.

They will also need to establish internal Donation Review Committees to assess the appropriateness of each donation and the liquidation strategy.To reduce risks of money laundering, all donations must be routed through verified Korean won exchange accounts, with verification responsibilities placed on banks, exchanges and the nonprofits themselves.Furthermore, only cryptocurrencies listed on at least three major domestic exchanges will be eligible, and liquidation is expected to occur immediately upon receipt.Guidelines regarding nonprofits selling crypto donations.

Sales will be capped at daily limits, typically no more than 10% of the total planned amount.Furthermore, sales will only be permitted for the top 20 tokens by market cap across five won-based exchanges. Importantly, exchanges are barred from selling tokens on their own platforms to prevent conflicts of interest.South Korea is also tightening standards for listing digital assets. The revised rules aim to curb instability from sudden price spikes by requiring a minimum circulating supply before a token is allowed to trade and temporarily restricting market orders post-listing.So-called zombie tokens (with low volume and thin market caps) and memecoins without clear utility will face more scrutiny. For instance, exchanges must delist tokens if they fail to meet liquidity benchmarks or community engagement thresholds.Starting in June, exchanges and nonprofits can apply for real-name accounts to facilitate these sales.

2025-05-21T07:35:00.000Z,"Why crypto transfers can fail and what you must check before sending","Why crypto transfers can fail and what you must check before sending              Crypto transfers fail more often than most people realize, but user attentiveness can stop most losses.What’s often marketed as a seamless, borderless system can become frustrating when transfers fail, with no customer service hotline to call and no easy recourse to reverse mistakes. In the crypto universe, the burden of getting it right falls squarely on the shoulders of the user.But here’s the encouraging part: Most failures are preventable. Understanding why crypto transfers fail can help users avoid costly missteps, navigate the quirks of different networks and send funds with far greater confidence. With a little preparation, you can sidestep common pitfalls and take control of your crypto experience.Did you know? According to a recent survey, 37% of people cite security risks as the most significant barrier to adopting crypto for payments, a reminder of how crucial it is to prioritize security at every step.                   Common crypto transfer mistakes              A single slip — wrong address, wrong network or underpaid fee — tops the list of costly crypto-transfer mistakes.Here’s a quick look at common crypto transfer mistakes:Sending crypto to the wrong address: Blockchain transactions are irreversible. A single wrong character in the recipient’s wallet address can send funds into the void, or worse, into a stranger’s wallet.Choosing the wrong network: Sending Tether USDt (USDT) over Ethereum instead of Tron? That’s a classic mistake. Always match the network to your recipient’s supported network.Underpaying gas or fees: Lowballing crypto gas fees, also known as blockchain transaction fees, can leave your transaction stuck or pending indefinitely.Not double-checking wallet compatibility: Some wallets can’t handle certain tokens or blockchains. Always verify.Sending tokens on the wrong network — like Ethereum instead of BNB Chain — can result in permanent loss. One user learned this the hard way (as shown in the image above) after transferring crypto to Coinbase from Binance using an unsupported network.                  Failed crypto transaction explained              Even perfect-looking transactions can crumble if gas is too low, a smart contract glitches or network congestion spikes.A failed crypto transaction can happen even if all the input details seem right. One major reason is insufficient gas fees. If the gas you set is too low, blockchain validators may ignore your transaction entirely. In some cases, this causes the transaction to fail outright; in others, it remains stuck in a pending state for hours or even days.Smart contract hiccups are another hidden landmine, especially in the decentralized finance (DeFi) world. If the contract’s code has flaws or can’t handle your input, your transaction can bounce back. Add in network congestion — especially on high-traffic chains like Ethereum, where every block is a battle for space — and even well-planned transfers can stall or fail without warning.Did You Know? A study analyzing over 1.5 billion failed transactions on the Solana blockchain found that bot spamming and network congestion were significant contributors to transaction failures.                  Crypto transfer troubleshooting guide              A quick five-point checklist (address, network, explorer status, wallet queue, asset support) usually reveals why funds haven’t landed.If your crypto transfer isn’t received, don’t panic. Check these first:Confirm the recipient’s address is correct.Verify the transfer network (was it Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon, etc.).Check the status on a block explorer (like Etherscan for Ethereum or Solscan for Solana).Review your wallet and see if the transfer is still pending.Make sure the recipient wallet supports the asset you sent.If you catch an issue early, some platforms allow you to speed up or cancel a stuck transaction by paying a higher gas fee.What to check before sending cryptoPrevention is your best friend.Before sending any crypto, take a few moments to verify all the critical details. Always double-check the recipient’s wallet address. The safest method is copy-paste; never type it out manually. Ensure that the address belongs to the correct network and is compatible with the token you’re sending.Make sure the address matches the right network and can handle the token you’re sending. And don’t forget the fees. On Ethereum, for example, you’ll need some ETH in your wallet to cover gas or that transfer’s going nowhere. Also, confirm the receiving wallet can accept the token and that you're not hitting any daily or regional transfer limits imposed by the platform.Did You Know? A single copy-paste mistake cost one crypto trader $26 million in Renzo Restaked ETH (ezETH). The tokens were sent to the wrong wallet address, and recovery was impossible, even with white hat hackers trying to help.                  Crypto transfer speed and networks              Different blockchains clear at various speeds, so match your urgency to a network’s typical confirmation time.Chains like Solana, Avalanche and Tron blaze through transactions in seconds, leaving older titans like Bitcoin and Ethereum catching their breath, especially when network traffic spikes and block space gets tight. And they’re not alone. Newer players like Aptos and Sui are also pushing the limits of scale and throughput, signaling a fierce race for speed across the crypto ecosystem.That’s why knowing the average speed of the network you’re using matters. Sending Bitcoin (BTC)? Expect to wait around 10 minutes per confirmation, there are 6 of them. Moving USDT on Solana? It should arrive almost instantly. Being aware of these differences helps set realistic expectations and avoid unnecessary panic when a transfer lags. And when every second counts — whether you’re racing to secure a trade or make a payment — choosing a fast crypto network can save you time and stress.                  How the crypto Travel Rule can cause transfer failures              Regulatory hurdles like the Travel Rule can freeze transfers if sender or recipient data doesn’t line up across jurisdictions.The crypto Travel Rule requires virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to share key details about the sender and recipient when handling transfers above set limits. If that information is missing, incomplete, or doesn’t match up, your transaction can hit a wall, often getting delayed or blocked entirely. This issue pops up frequently in cross-border transfers or when moving funds to exchanges.Other problems arise from the “sunrise issue,” where some countries have adopted the Travel Rule and others haven’t. This mismatch can lead to compliance conflicts and blocked transactions. Self-hosted wallets also present a challenge: Some VASPs won’t process transfers to wallets they can’t verify. As regulations tighten, expect more of these friction points in crypto transfers.Did you know? A report by Cointelegraph Research and Onramper found that 50% of fiat-to-crypto transactions fail, even when users have completed Know Your Customer (KYC) checks. User location, banking restrictions and local regulations all play a role in whether those transactions succeed or collapse.                   How to avoid failed crypto transactions              Send a test amount, watch live gas trackers and never rush. Slow, informed moves keep transactions from failing.Avoiding failed transactions comes down to awareness and caution. First, always test with a small amount before transferring large sums. This gives you a chance to catch mistakes without losing much. Second, always monitor current gas fees, especially on volatile networks like Ethereum. Tools like Etherscan Gas Tracker and Blocknative Gas Estimator give live Ethereum gas prices. Many wallets (like MetaMask) also show gas estimates in the app. Using a reputable crypto wallet that offers real-time fee suggestions and transaction previews helps immensely. Finally, take your time. Many failed transactions happen simply because users are in a rush or feeling pressured to act fast. In crypto, speed can kill your funds.Did you know? One user paid $200 in gas fees on Ethereum for a failed transaction that returned nothing. The cause? Slippage settings were off, and the network still charged full fees.                  How to verify a crypto transfer              Plug the transaction hash into a block explorer for an instant verdict on whether your transfer is pending, confirmed or failed.Once you send crypto, the transaction hash becomes your receipt. Paste it into a block explorer of the chain you used, like Etherscan, Solscan or Tronscan, to get live updates. This will tell you if the transaction is pending, confirmed or failed, along with timestamps, block numbers and fee details.Some wallets and exchanges now offer built-in tracking tools that integrate directly with explorers. These make it easier for beginners to stay informed without needing to navigate third-party websites. If a transfer seems stuck, checking the status this way should always be your first move.                  Mastering crypto transfers: Confidence over chaos              Triple-checking details, monitoring fees and staying curious turns crypto transfers from a gamble into a confident routine. One wrong digit, one wrong network, and your funds could vanish into the void. This isn’t just about saving your wallet; it’s about owning your peace of mind.As blockchains scale and regulations tighten, the winners are those who move smart, not just fast. So here’s the vibe: Slow down to level up. Triple-check that address. Know the platform you’re using. Watch those fees. Stay cool when networks get jammed.The pros don’t rush; they prepare. Back up your keys. Keep your tools sharp. Stay curious and keep learning, because the crypto game rewards those who respect it.Master the flow, and you trade chaos for confidence. That’s when crypto becomes your playground.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/why-crypto-transfers-can-fail-and-what-you-must-check-before-sending?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-20T20:54:27.000Z,"Justin Sun to attend Trump&#039;s dinner with memecoin backers","After weeks of speculation among crypto enthusiasts and news outlets, Tron founder Justin Sun has claimed he owns the wallet that purchased the largest amount of Donald Trump’s memecoin, allowing him to qualify for a dinner and reception with the US president.In a May 19 X post, Sun said he had received an invitation to attend Trump’s dinner at his golf club outside Washington, DC, as part of a reward for the top 220 memecoin holders. The Tron founder claimed he controlled the top wallet on the TRUMP token leaderboard under the username “Sun,” which held roughly $19 million worth of the memecoin at a price of $13.20.According to Sun, he plans to network at the May 22 memecoin dinner, “talk crypto,” and “discuss the future” of the industry. It’s unclear why the Tron founder chose to announce his planned presence at the event now, when the leaderboard was finalized on May 12. Cointelegraph reached out to a spokesperson for Sun for comment, but had not received a response at the time of publication.Source: Justin SunThough not a surprise to many who speculated that Sun was the individual behind the memecoin purchases, his attendance at the dinner only deepens his ties to the Trump administration and the president’s family. In addition to the dinner for the 220 tokenholders, Trump said he would hold a reception and “VIP tour” for the top 25 wallets on the leaderboard.Related: What to expect at Trump’s memecoin dinnerSun spent $75 million on tokens through World Liberty Financial, the crypto platform backed by Trump’s three sons, including a $30 million investment a few weeks after the 2024 election. The Tron founder is also an adviser to the company.Before Trump won the November election, Sun had been facing a lawsuit from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed in 2023 over the alleged “orchestration of the unregistered offer and sale, manipulative trading, and unlawful touting of crypto asset securities.” In February, roughly a month after Trump took office and appointed Commissioner Mark Uyeda as acting chair of the SEC, the regulator and Sun jointly filed a motion for a federal judge to stay the case, which was granted.Memecoin’s potential conflicts of interest are affecting CongressSun’s and others’ involvement in Trump’s crypto ventures has prompted calls for investigations and oversight among many Democratic lawmakers, who argued that some individuals could use digital assets to essentially purchase influence with the president. The concerns initially slowed progress on a bill to regulate stablecoins in the Senate, the GENIUS Act, complicated by World Liberty Financial’s own stablecoin, USD1. The chamber voted to move forward on the bill on May 19, a few hours before Sun’s announcement.“How convenient: the day after the Senate advances the GENIUS Act, Justin Sun — a major investor in the Trump family crypto venture — announces he’s getting a private dinner as the president’s top crypto buyer,” said Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, according to Bloomberg. “It’s critical that everyone understands the GENIUS Act doesn’t stop this type of corruption — it greenlights it.”At a May 20 oversight hearing, Maryland Representative Glenn Ivey questioned SEC Chair Paul Atkins on Sun’s case being stayed, as well as his investments in World Liberty Financial and Trump’s memecoin. Though the case was stayed before Atkins was sworn in as chair, Ivey expressed concern about the timeline between Sun’s investments and the SEC not pursuing its own enforcement action.The memecoin dinner applicants are likely still subject to background checks before meeting Trump in person. As of May 20, those planning to attend included Kronos Research chief investment officer Vincent Liu, Hyperithm co-CEO Oh Sangrok, Synthetix founder Kain Warwick, a consultant named Vincent Deriu, crypto user Morten Christensen, a World Liberty Financial adviser going by the pseudonym “Ogle,” and a representative from the startup MemeCore.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/justin-sun-attend-trump-dinner-with-memecoin-backers?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: CoinGlassWhile it's impossible to predict what could spark a breakout above $108,000 to force those leveraged shorts to unwind, there is growing optimism tied to rising concerns over United States fiscal debt. Uncertainty remains about how the government plans to achieve economic growth while reducing spending, especially in light of ongoing disagreement between Democratic and Republican lawmakers.More importantly, yields on the 20-year US Treasury remain close to 5%, up from 4.82% two weeks earlier. Weak demand for long-term government debt may compel the US Federal Reserve to step in as the buyer of last resort to maintain market stability, reversing a 26-month trend. This approach puts downward pressure on the US dollar and drives investors to seek alternative hedging strategies, including Bitcoin.Gold dominates, but Bitcoin absorbs flow amid reserve reallocationsGold remains the dominant alternative asset, but its 24% year-to-date gains in 2025 and $22 trillion market capitalization make it less attractive to many investors. For context, the entire S&P 500 index is valued at $53 trillion, while US bank deposits and Treasury bills (M1) amount to $18.6 trillion. In contrast, Bitcoin currently represents a $2.1 trillion asset class, roughly equivalent in size to silver.Meanwhile, some regions, notably the US, have begun laying the groundwork to shift portions of their gold reserves into Bitcoin—an action that could easily propel BTC to a new all-time high. A modest 5% reallocation from gold into Bitcoin by those nations would translate into a $105 billion inflow, equivalent to 1 million BTC at a price of $105,000. Related: Bitcoin ready to ‘vaporize’ shorts once price discovery above $110K beginsFor perspective, Strategy, the US-listed firm led by Michael Saylor, currently holds 576,230 BTC. There is little doubt that institutional buying remains the primary catalyst for Bitcoin to break above the $108,000 level. Such a move would trigger the liquidation of heavily leveraged bearish positions, likely accelerating the push to a new all-time high. However, persistent macroeconomic uncertainty continues to weigh on overall investor sentiment.As Bitcoin flirts with the $107,000 mark, those holding short positions face heightened risk of forced liquidations—an outcome that could further fuel upward momentum in price.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The relative strength index (RSI), although still near the overbought region, has significantly cooled over the past few days. An ETH breakout with rising RSI and volume could confirm the bullish move, while a drop below $2,400 risks invalidating the pattern.Can Ether reclaim the Gaussian Channel midline?On May 20, Ether showed a significant trend shift as it attempted to reclaim the mid-line of the 2-week Gaussian Channel, a technical indicator used to identify price trends.

Likewise, crypto trader Merlijn noted a golden cross between the 50-day SMA and 200-day SMA (simple moving average), which could further strengthen an imminent ETH breakout.

The analyst said,“I am leaning toward price carving out a range bound environment for at least several weeks potentially longer, and once again becoming a buyer.”A contrarian outlook to bulls can also be observed with ETH prices oscillating under the Fibonacci levels.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewWith respect to its current market trend, Bitcoin is inches away from a ‘price discovery’ period, as noted by crypto trader Jelle.Price discovery in this context refers to the process where buyers and sellers interact at an undefined or non-traded range to determine the market price of an asset.A break above Bitcoin's all-time high of $110,000 would initiate a price discovery phase, driving BTC into an uncharted trading range with successive higher highs until market participants establish a new equilibrium between supply and demand.Cointelegraph reported that Bitcoin is close to confirming a “golden cross” on its daily chart, which has historically preceded 45% to 60% price rallies. Such a move coincides with the probability of BTC hitting new highs this month.A monthly close near $110,000 would mark a 15% to 17% gain for Bitcoin in May, its strongest May performance since 2019. This would significantly surpass the historical average monthly return of 8% for the month.Bitcoin historical monthly returns.

The third compression phase in 2025 mirrors the 2017 cycle, where the Bitcoin halving events and supply shocks fueled retail FOMO, driving major price rallies. From the vantage point of Bitcoin liquidation, over $3 billion in short leveraged positions are at risk of being liquidated if BTC price moves to $110,000 from $105,000. In contrast, it would take a drop to $94,612 to trigger a similar amount in long liquidations. This skew suggests a higher probability of the price pushing upward to chase liquidity on the sell-side rather than dropping lower.Technical analyst Gert van Lagen noted a similar outlook, stating, “A liquidation magnet is glowing above $107K, ready to vaporize billions in shorts. First, BTC soared on fear. Next, it'll rise on liquidations.”Bitcoin liquidity levels.

2025-05-20T18:00:00.000Z,"Coinbase CEO&#039;s journey from no &#039;political causes&#039; to hiring DOGE staff","Five years ago, Brian Armstrong wanted employees of his cryptocurrency exchange to refrain from expressing political views at work. Now, the Coinbase CEO seems to be open to involvement with Republican figures, including members of US President Donald Trump’s inner circle.In a May 13 X post, Armstrong said members of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team, spearheaded by Elon Musk, though not set up as an actual department, would be welcome to implement cost-cutting changes at Coinbase after leaving the US government. Armstrong offered to set up an accelerated onboarding process with the exchange, responding to an interview in which at least one DOGE staffer felt ostracized from Harvard University, where he had been enrolled.“If you are looking for your next mission after serving your country, consider helping create a more efficient financial system for the world at Coinbase,” Armstrong said.Since assuming a government position at the White House in January, Musk and the DOGE team have faced criticism from both sides of the aisle over their cuts, which often forced out or fired experienced employees without proper notice. Lawsuits halting DOGE’s efforts or challenging dismissals are pending in federal court from parties alleging illegal or unconstitutional actions.Coinbase once called itself a ‘mission-focused company’Armstrong’s remarks, suggesting approval of DOGE’s actions, represented a sharp departure from the CEO’s position before Trump’s second term. At the time, many of the companies and executives in California’s Silicon Valley seemed to be more publicly aligned with Democrats. In 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the death of George Floyd at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis spurred nationwide outrage and protests, prompting many companies to take a public position. Armstrong issued a notice at the time saying that Coinbase was a “mission-focused company” that didn’t “advocate for any particular causes or candidates.”In response to Armstrong not publicly supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, many Coinbase employees organized a walkout. The CEO responded by claiming the crypto exchange had an “apolitical culture” and that roughly 5% of Coinbase staff who “didn’t feel they could be on board with this direction” had accepted an exit package.Related: Coinbase considered Saylor-like Bitcoin strategy before opting out: BloombergLess than a month later, Armstrong retweeted a post suggesting he could support Kanye West for US President in 2020. After that time, the CEO made few public statements related to politics and US laws, though he did push for clarification on crypto tax rules in 2021.Stand with Crypto moves Coinbase closer to political advocacyIt’s not entirely clear how Armstrong, at least in public, moved to be more aligned with political figures. However, for Coinbase, which the CEO said was intended to be “apolitical,” the change seemed to have started around the time the company received a Wells notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in March 2023, suggesting a potential enforcement action.Armstrong, like many in the crypto industry, had often criticized the SEC before 2023 for not offering regulatory guidelines to follow, but the Wells notice and subsequent lawsuit seemed to move Coinbase from participating in a national political discussion on digital assets to outright advocacy. The company announced the launch of the Stand with Crypto Alliance in August 2023, a group “focused on mobilizing the crypto community to directly engage in the legislative process.”Before Stand with Crypto, Armstrong used his platform to call on crypto supporters to contact their elected officials about digital asset bills moving through Congress. Even with this initiative tied to the exchange and CEO, the focus wasn’t on partisan politics, but “common-sense legislation to protect consumers and their right to crypto.” “Being anti-crypto is a really bad political strategy going into 2024,” said Armstrong in a December 2023 X post, in response to legislation aimed at fighting money laundering with digital assets.Enter Trump and the 2024 election cycleIn contrast to the 2020 election and even the 2022 midterms, the 2024 cycle stood out in more ways than one. For the first time, a presidential candidate was openly advocating for policies favoring cryptocurrency. The amount of money flowing from companies in the industry, including Coinbase, into federal elections also reached a record high.Stand with Crypto, as an advocacy organization, was no exception. The group launched its own political action committee (PAC) in May 2024, allowing it to influence the elections through media buys and direct contributions. Though Stand with Crypto still organized like-minded voters, its efforts included a renewed focus on money.It stood alongside the Fairshake PAC, a committee backed by roughly $45 million from Coinbase and $45 million from Ripple, which spent more than $130 million in the 2024 election cycle. Armstrong personally contributed $1 million to Fairshake.Though the Coinbase CEO suggested a political preference, he seemed not to take a strong position at the exchange ahead of the election. In Coinbase’s shareholder letter for the third quarter of 2024, the exchange said it was “prepared to work with either administration” in the US, whether that meant Trump or Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.More front-facing in Washington, DCArmstrong became more of a presence on Capitol Hill and among members of the Trump administration after the results of the 2024 election. He personally met with the then-president-elect in November and reportedly attended at least one of the inauguration events with other cryptocurrency executives. Coinbase also donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund.In February, the exchange announced that the SEC would be dropping its enforcement action, marking one of many crypto-related lawsuits the regulator has dismissed under Trump. Armstrong said at the time that the move was “an important signal about where things are going.” The CEO was going to Washington, DC, seemingly more frequently than he had before this administration took power. In addition to inauguration events, Armstrong attended a crypto summit at the White House with Trump and other high-level executives and spoke with lawmakers in the Capitol to support bills establishing a regulatory framework for payment stablecoins and crypto markets. Coinbase CEO in the US Capitol rotunda on May 14.

There are fewer legal burdens and an administration that is seemingly friendly to the industry and Armstrong personally.Magazine: Elon Musk’s plan to run government on blockchain faces uphill battle",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/brian-armstrong-coinbase-political-journey?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
