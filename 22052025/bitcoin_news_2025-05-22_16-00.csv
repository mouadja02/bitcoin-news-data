2025-05-22T13:55:03.000Z,"Cardano Price Reclaims $0.80 As Bullish Setup Reignites, $0.85 In Sight For ADA","The post Cardano Price Reclaims $0.80 As Bullish Setup Reignites, $0.85 In Sight For ADA appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Key Takeaways ADA reclaimed $0.80 after bouncing from $0.71, forming a bullish higher-low structure. Momentum flipped positive , with RSI > 60 and MACD showing a fresh bullish crossover. BBTrend surged to +5.22 , signaling strong volatility and breakout potential. Open interest hit $917M , marking its highest level in 2025 and confirming rising trader confidence. Bitcoin hit a fresh all-time high of $111,861 on May 22, pushing the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 73 (Greed) —its highest reading in weeks. This surge in sentiment has triggered renewed momentum across major altcoins, with Cardano (ADA) reclaiming the $0.80 mark and flashing signs of a bullish continuation. Will momentum hold into next week? ADA/USD Structure Recovery Backed by Momentum Shift Cardano’s price action has seen sharp turns in 2025. On March 2 , ADA surged from $0.64 to $1.19 — its biggest one-day spike this year, a gain of +85% . But profit-taking led to a deep correction, bottoming out at $0.5114 on April 2 , a -57% drop . Since then, ADA has been rebuilding, climbing to $0.84 on May 10 , then briefly correcting to $0.71 on May 19 , before bouncing back above $0.80 . This climb is supported by a bullish structure of higher lows. Price now trades above a rising trendline, with key support at $0.7526 (0.236 Fib) and resistance at $0.8533 (0.5 Fib). A break above this zone could open the door to $0.934 (0.618 Fib) in the short term. Cardano price indicator setup has also shifted bullishly . RSI recovered from 45–48 on May 19 to above 61.13 , reflecting improving buying strength. MACD completed a bullish crossover on May 21–22, with expanding green histogram bars signaling fresh momentum. Most notably, the BBTrend , which tracks directional strength using Bollinger Band volatility, flipped from negative to +8.9913 — its highest reading in months. This confirms rising volatility alongside bullish price action, helping validate the breakout attempt. Volume trends further support the move. After a quiet start to May, spot and derivatives activity has surged , with open interest now at $917M — the highest in 2025. This signals rising conviction among traders and real capital inflow behind the price push. Short-Term Forecast: Bullish, With Caution If ADA holds above the $0.75–$0.77 support band this week, a retest of the $0.85 level is likely. A clean breakout above $0.853 could accelerate gains toward $0.93–$0.94 in the next 7–10 days. However, failure to sustain above $0.75 would expose ADA to downside risk toward $0.72 or even $0.647 in a broader pullback. Verdict: Bullish Bias with Near-Term Upside The technical and on-chain picture supports a bullish bias for ADA in the short term, especially if momentum sustains above key Fib levels. While resistance at $0.85 may cause temporary friction, the overall structure favours upside continuation, potentially targeting $0.93 within the next 10 days.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/cardano-price-reclaims-0-80-as-bullish-setup-reignites-0-85-in-sight-for-ada/,"ADA|ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-05-22T13:51:36.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Shatters $110,000, Sets New All-Time High","Bitcoin (BTC) smashed its previous all-time high and crossed the $110,000 mark for the first time. The flagship cryptocurrency had teased a move higher earlier in the week when it briefly crossed $107,000. BTC is up nearly 4% in the past 24 hours as it tests the waters above $110,000. BTC’s rally puts the flagship cryptocurrency in uncharted territory as it enters a period of price discovery. Bitcoin hit an intraday high of $111,726 earlier in the session before retreating to current levels. Bitcoin (BTC) Surges To New All-Time High Bitcoin (BTC) shattered the $110,000 level and surged to a new all-time high of $111,726 as market sentiment improved. The flagship cryptocurrency had teased a move past this level earlier in the week as markets recovered from the trade war and tariff-induced selloffs. Bitcoin’s rally was driven by several factors, including easing trade tensions, clarity around tariffs, and Moody’s downgrade of US sovereign debt, prompting investors to seek alternative investments. Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of digital asset trading platform Nexo, stated, “Now that January's high has been surpassed - and the 50 percent upside from April's lows has been achieved - bitcoin enters blue sky territory with tailwinds in the form of institutional momentum and a favorable U.S. regulatory environment.” Market watchers also highlighted growing institutional interest and participation as another driver of the rally. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a longtime crypto skeptic, recently said the bank would allow its clients to purchase Bitcoin. Coinbase was also added to the S&P 500 index, further boosting investor sentiment. “We're still in year four of the bitcoin price cycle - the year after the bitcoin halving when miner rewards are slashed in half - which historically means its best days are still ahead of it and - while macro uncertainty and the threat of further volatility remains, a target of $150,000 in 2025 is still very much on the cards.” What’s Behind The Bitcoin (BTC) Rally? BTC soared past its previous all-time high, set at the beginning of the year, rising to $111,726 after registering a sharp increase of above 4% in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has risen over 23% in the past month, posting a sharp reversal from April’s downturn. The flagship cryptocurrency’s rally mirrors the ongoing recovery in US equities despite Wednesday’s selloff. The S&P 500 has risen 15% since late April, while the Nasdaq is up over 21%. Analysts have attributed the increase to growing optimism about President Trump’s trade policies and easing trade tensions between the US and China. Texas Approves Bitcoin Reserve Bill Texas is close to becoming the third US state to establish and manage a Bitcoin reserver after the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Investment Act, SB 21, was approved by the House of Representatives with a vote of 101-42. The bill will now be sent to Governor Greg Abbott for approval. The bill authorizes the state comptroller to invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with a market cap of over $500 billion over the past 12 months. Bitcoin is the only asset that meets this criteria. The bill also directs the creation of a formal Bitcoin reserve and positions the state to diversify its financial strategy by investing in digital assets. If signed, Texas will join New Hampshire and potentially Arizona to become the only US state to establish a Bitcoin reserve. However, governors in Arizona and Montana voted to block similar proposals, citing extreme volatility in the crypto markets. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) rallied to a new all-time high after finally crossing $110,000 and reaching $111,726. The move was driven by growing optimism around crypto regulation, institutional interest in BTC , and easing trade tensions. A broader rally in the US markets also buoyed investor sentiment. James Butterfill, head of research for crypto-focused asset manager CoinShares, stated, “The rally was also helped along by broader macro concerns, including Moody’s recent downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, which added to the narrative of Bitcoin as a hedge against fiat instability.” There have also been positive developments for crypto on the regulatory front, with the GENIUS Act, a key bill for stablecoin regulation, clearing a key procedural vote in the Senate. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have also registered steady inflows, according to analysts. BTC started the previous week in the red, dropping over 1% on Monday and settling at $102,728. The price recovered on Tuesday, registering an increase of 1.36% and settling at $104,123. BTC was back in the red on Wednesday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $103,568. The price plunged to an intraday low of $101,459 on Thursday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $103,816. Price action turned bearish on Friday and Saturday as BTC registered marginal declines and settled at $103,235. Despite the selling pressure, BTC recovered on Sunday, rising over 3% to cross $106,000 and settling at $106,489. Source: TradingView The price plunged to an intraday low of $102,135 on Monday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,572, ultimately registering a decline of nearly 1%. Market sentiment turned bullish on Tuesday as BTC rose 1.21% and settled at $106,854. The price continued to push higher on Wednesday, rising 2.57% to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,604. BTC surged to an intraday high of $111,726 during the ongoing session. The price is currently up nearly 2% and trading at $111,540. Analysts believe BTC’s rally could continue as it enters a price discovery phase. The immediate target is $115,000, but a move past this level could see the price reach $120,000.

2025-05-22T13:44:58.000Z,"BTC Hits $110K, XRP Follows , What Does That Mean for Pepeto, Solaxy, and the Future of Crypto?","The post BTC Hits $110K, XRP Follows , What Does That Mean for Pepeto, Solaxy, and the Future of Crypto? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Solaxy Could Grow , But Is It Really What Solana Needs? If you’re holding Solaxy or looking at it, there’s something you should know now that the market is heating up. With Bitcoin breaking above $110,000 and XRP moving higher , the whole crypto space is getting attention again. Investors are rushing to look at new projects , especially meme coins. That’s why Solaxy is starting to trend. It calls itself the first Layer 2 built on Solana , and yes , that sounds exciting. But let’s take a closer look. Layer 2 technology helps slow and expensive blockchains like Ethereum. It makes transactions faster and fees cheaper. But Solana is already one of the fastest and cheapest chains in crypto . So adding a Layer 2 doesn’t really fix a problem , because there wasn’t one to begin with . That’s where the question comes in. Solaxy might still grow , maybe even 5x , but it might not go much further, simply because its technology doesn’t bring major change to the Solana ecosystem. That’s why some investors are saying:. And that’s exactly when Pepeto enters the picture , with real tools, a deep story, and growing momentum . Pepeto Has a Stronger Foundation , Tech, Story, and Real Market Impact If Solaxy is catching early interest, Pepeto is quickly turning into the headline. It’s not just another meme coin, it’s a full-on crypto platform being built piece by piece. The team behind Pepeto is launching a dedicated exchange , where many of the newest meme coins of 2025 will be listed. That means daily users, daily traffic, and most importantly , real value for the $PEPETO token . Every coin that launches on the Pepeto exchange will bring new eyes and new utility. But Pepeto goes even further. It’s building PepetoSwap , a special swap platform that connects multiple blockchains , thanks to bridge technology . Want to move your tokens from Ethereum to Solana? Or from BNB Chain to Avalanche? PepetoSwap makes that easy, fast, and cheap. It’s solving a real problem that many traders face today , and doing it with a fun, meme-powered brand that also delivers value. Here’s what makes Pepeto one of the most talked-about meme coins right now : A new exchange just for meme coins launching in 2025 PepetoSwap a tool for trading across blockchains Fast and cheap bridge technology for better access A staking system that rewards token holders An active, growing community that supports the project Tier 1 exchange listings already in the works A unique backstory that links it directly to Pepe the Frog The Real Story Behind Pepeto and Why It’s Bigger Than Just Hype Many believe that the meme coin world changed when Pepe the Frog launched but not everyone knows the full story. Some say Pepe’s success came from stealing four original documents from an early-stage project called Pepeto. These documents were titled P, E, P, and E , standing for Precision, Energy, Power, and Efficiency . Pepe launched fast, grabbed the spotlight, but left out two important parts: T for Technology , and O for Optimization . That’s what the word “ Pepeto ” really means. It’s the full picture. And that’s why Pepeto calls itself the God of Frogs , not just another copy. https://www.instagram.com/reel/DB1QEqrP96L/?igsh=MzdsbGxoaHRmazJt Now, rumors are growing people believe that the original Pepe founder , who was left out and betrayed, is actually the one now building Pepeto. If that’s true, this isn’t just a comeback — it’s a mission to finish what was started, with the right tools, a powerful brand, and a strong plan to grow. The Bottom Line: Pepeto Brings Real Utility in a Time When Meme Coins Must Offer More With Bitcoin surging past $110K and XRP regaining momentum , the crypto market is clearly waking up. But investors are getting smarter. Hype isn’t enough anymore. Projects need real value, real tools, and real communities . That’s where Pepeto checks every box. It has the exchange . It has the bridge tech . It has the story . And it might just have the founder who started it all . Stay in touch with Pepeto announcement via tg : https://t.me/pepeto_channel Solaxy might still rise maybe a clean 5x , as the first of its kind on Solana. But if you’re looking for the next big meme coin that mixes humor, hype, and serious tools, Pepeto may be the one that leads the next era . Joining the $PEPETO project takes just a few simple steps: Set Up a Crypto Wallet – Use a wallet that supports Ethereum, such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Deposit Funds – Add ETH, USDT, or BNB to your wallet. Participate in the Presale – Go to pepeto.io to purchase your $PEPETO tokens. Stake Your Holdings – Access the staking platform to start earning passive rewards. Why $PEPETO Stands Out $PEPETO brings together the viral appeal of meme coins with real blockchain utility. From a zero-fee trading platform and cross-chain bridge to high staking incentives, it’s positioned as a major contender in the evolving crypto landscape, especially heading into 2025.

2025-05-22T13:41:39.000Z,"Crypto Tax Filings Nearly Double in Finland, But Majority Remain Undeclared","Key Takeaways: Crypto tax filings in Finland nearly doubled in a year, but only a fraction of holders report trades. Authorities are ramping up enforcement, including asset seizures and cross-border crackdowns. Garantex exchange was dismantled after processing $96B linked to illicit activity since 2019. The number of Finnish taxpayers reporting cryptocurrency trades has nearly doubled, rising from 8,200 to 16,000 in just one year, according to local media outlet Uutissuomalainen . Despite the surge, the figure still pales in comparison to the estimated 300,000 Finns believed to hold digital assets. In last year’s filings, declared crypto-related gains reached €230 million, with losses totaling €30 million—both significantly higher than the combined €50 million declared two years ago. Finland’s Crypto Boom Outpaces Tax Compliance The data points to rising engagement in crypto markets, but also highlights the gap between actual ownership and compliance. Since May 2019, Finland’s Financial Supervisory Authority (FIN-FSA) has been responsible for overseeing the country’s crypto sector, including exchanges and wallet providers. Under Finnish law, all crypto service providers operating domestically must register and comply with financial regulations. The latest numbers suggest enforcement and awareness are growing—but full transparency remains elusive. In January, Finnish police seized around $2.68 million worth of luxury watches from Hex founder Richard Schueler, also known as Richard Heart, as part of an ongoing investigation into tax fraud and assault. The 20 high-end watches, mostly Rolexes, were discovered in a residence in Espoo and are believed to belong to Schueler. Authorities used intelligence efforts to trace the abandoned collection, with purchases made in both Finland and the U.S. Eight of the watches were officially confiscated, according to Inspector Harri Saaristola, who is leading the investigation. In March, the US Justice Department, in coordination with Germany and Finland, dismantled the online infrastructure of Garantex , a cryptocurrency exchange accused of facilitating money laundering for criminal and terrorist organizations. The exchange, which has processed at least $96 billion in cryptocurrency transactions since 2019, has been taken offline following law enforcement action. Denmark Considers Taxing Unrealized Crypto Gains Denmark’s Tax Law Council has proposed a bill that would tax unrealized gains and losses on crypto holdings, potentially starting in 2026. The recommendation is detailed in a 93-page report and suggests a unified tax model for all digital assets. The council evaluated three frameworks for crypto taxation: capital gains, warehouse taxation, and inventory accounting. This initiative mirrors a growing international shift toward stricter tax enforcement on crypto and other financial assets. Italy is also tightening its stance. Vice Economy Minister Maurizio Leo recently announced plans to raise the capital gains tax on cryptocurrencies from 26% to 42% , specifically citing Bitcoin.

Shiba Inu gained widespread fame by turning small amounts into life-changing profits, climbing more than 80,000,000% from its debut price to its peak, making it one of crypto’s biggest stories. Pepe followed closely, surging rapidly and delivering strong returns to its initial supporters as it rose through the meme coin ranks. However, both projects now seem to have limited upside. Shiba Inu’s market cap is deep in the billions, and Pepe remains close to its highs, making it difficult to see the same kind of explosive growth again. Influencer Pepe (INPEPE) is gaining traction as the next-gen memecoin, uniquely positioned at the intersection of Web3 and the booming $25+ billion influencer economy. Unlike traditional meme tokens, INPEPE aims to be the official currency for influencer payments, offering: Instant, borderless payouts No middlemen or platform fees On-chain proof of performance and engagement INPEPE doesn’t just ride the meme wave—it provides a tangible solution for content creators struggling with delayed payments and platform limitations. This real-world utility is what separates INPEPE from hype-only coins. That’s why Influencer Pepe (INPEPE) is now grabbing attention. In its presale phase, Influencer Pepe (INPEPE) is gaining momentum thanks to its dramatic backstor and expanding community. With a current price of $0.0000002042 per token, Influencer Pepe (INPEPE) presents a rare early entry point and making it to be the next big meme coin breakout. Pepe and Influencer Pepe (INPEPE): The Buzz, Shiba’s Path, and Why Influencer Pepe (INPEPE) Could Lead the Next Wave Rumors about a connection between Pepe and Influencer Pepe (INPEPE) continue to generate discussion within crypto circles, keeping investors intrigued. Influencer Pepe (INPEPE) claims to complete the vision, aiming to offer long-term value and real use cases that set it apart from typical meme coins. Influencer Pepe (INPEPE) is positioning itself as a stronger and more complete project than both Shiba and Pepe. As momentum builds, many believe Influencer Pepe (INPEPE) could achieve gains that rival or even surpass those of Shiba and Pepe. Presales like Influencer Pepe (INPEPE)’s highlight why early entry can be a game-changer: lower price, more potential, and a vision backed by real tools. Can INPEPE Deliver 100x Returns Like PEPE? If you invest $10,000 in Influencer Pepe (INPEPE) at the current price of $0.0000002042, you’d be holding nearly 49 million tokens. Should INPEPE climb to PEPE’s peak price of $0.00001308, that investment could skyrocket to over $640,000—offering a potential 60x+ return. Considering both projects share the same token supply and INPEPE is gaining traction with rumors of a Tier 1 exchange listing, the upside remains significant. With investor attention rapidly growing, INPEPE may be on the verge of a breakout moment.

Investing in digital assets is becoming increasingly important in the “world of the exponential age and currency debasement,” according to Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Global Macro Investor. “You don’t own enough crypto. When you do, you don’t own enough NFT’s, as art is upstream of wealth. Both will never be this cheap again,” Pal said. NFTs are “the single best long term store of wealth I know and you get to buy it before network effects kick in,” he added in another response. Source: Raoul Pal “There is some validity to the statement that NFTs, and in extension art, become a vehicle for the wealthy once a certain level of wealth is reached,” wrote Nicolai Sondergaard, research analyst at Nansen, calling it a “natural move” for asset diversification. “For traders and investors, further down the wealth curve, NFTs are partially about speculating on future returns,” he told Cointelegraph, adding that NFTs also benefit from the allure of strong communities, beyond just wealth creation. Related: German gov’t missed out on $2.3B profit after selling Bitcoin at $57K Art NFTs may see a resurgence as “digital ownership gains acceptance among younger, tech-savvy cohorts,” if collections manage to move past the “speculative fervor,” according to Anndy Lian, author and intergovernmental blockchain expert. Still, Lian said broader adoption depends on blockchain networks improving scalability and security to “instill confidence.” He added that art NFTs “must transcend hype, anchoring value in cultural significance or utility.” Beeple’s “Everydays: The First 5000 Days.” Source: Christies Some digital artists made millions of dollars through NFTs.

Shiba Inu gained notoriety by transforming modest investments into substantial fortunes, soaring by over 80,000,000% from its initial price to its peak, securing its place among cryptocurrency’s top success stories. Pepe followed a similar trajectory, making headlines with a rapid ascent that propelled it into the meme coin elite, offering significant profits to early adopters. However, as both tokens have matured, their growth potential appears to have diminished, making it more challenging to replicate past performances. With Shiba Inu’s valuation now entrenched in the billions and Pepe maintaining elevated price levels, the opportunity for similar explosive gains has narrowed. This shift in the landscape has prompted investors to explore emerging alternatives with high growth potential. Enter Influencer Pepe (INPEPE) , a new entrant capturing attention with its bold narrative, expanding community, and practical utility. INPEPE aims to revolutionize the influencer economy by offering instant, borderless payouts, eliminating middlemen and platform fees, and providing on-chain proof of performance and engagement.

2025-05-22T13:38:31.000Z,"Why is the Dow Jones tumbling while Bitcoin and altcoins are rising?","Bitcoin and altcoins continued soaring on Thursday, even as the US stock market downturn continued. Bitcoin ( BTC ) jumped to a record high of $111,860, while the market cap of all cryptocurrencies jumped to $3.5 trillion. In contrast, the Dow opened lower by around 100 points, adding to Wednesday’s 816 point drop. Bitcoin and altcoins are climbing after the U.S. Senate passed the GENIUS Act , a first-of-its-kind cryptocurrency regulation focused on stablecoins. The legislation requires stablecoin issuers to maintain 100 percent reserve backing with high-quality assets such as U.S. Treasuries and the dollar. It also mandates monthly disclosures detailing reserve composition. Other provisions include federal and state oversight. Stablecoin issuers with assets above 10 billion dollars will be regulated at the federal level, while states will oversee smaller issuers with less than 10 billion dollars in assets. The passage of the GENIUS Act is significant, as it helps safeguard the crypto industry, especially following the collapse of Terra in 2022 and other major failures, like FTX. It also provides long-awaited legal clarity. Bitcoin as a safe haven after the US credit rating downgrade Bitcoin and altcoins are rising because investors see BTC as a safe haven asset after Moody’s downgraded the US credit rating . The safe-haven appeal has pushed investors into spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have added over $4.2 billion in inflows this month, bringing the cumulative total to $43 billion. In its statement, Moody’s pointed to the rising US debt and interest payments and the policies in Washington. For example, the House of Representatives passed the “big, beautiful bill” that will add around $3.8 trillion in additional debt , according to some estimates.

It also expands the child tax credit and includes a new senior tax relief of 4,000 dollars. Fears over the rising U.S. debt and deficit have led investors to pull back from U.S. assets, especially equities. The U.S. Dollar Index has dropped to 99.6, while bond yields have surged. The 30-year yield rose to 5.1 percent, and the 10-year climbed to 4.6 percent.

On the daily chart, it has formed a cup and handle pattern while narrowly avoiding a death cross. A death cross occurs when the 50-day and 200-day moving averages cross while trending downward. This same setup nearly played out in August last year but was avoided. The cup pattern has a depth of about 30 percent.

2025-05-22T13:30:43.000Z,"Crypto Trader Dumps XRP Holdings For Ethereum, Explains Why","A prominent crypto trader on the X (formerly Twitter) platform has made waves on social media after revealing that he sold off all of his XRP holdings in order to buy Ethereum . The trader who is known as Doctor Profit on social media revealed this to his over 400,000 followers on the platform, along with reasons why he made this move and what he expects going forward. Dump XRP For 600% Gains To Buy Ethereum Doctor Profit had first revealed on May 19 his intent to begin selling his XRP stash. In this initial post, he revealed that all of his XRP was bought at very low prices between $0.2 and $0.5, putting his entry very low. At the current price at the time, the crypto trader was sitting on a profit of approximately 608% at this point. This was when he told his followers that he intended to start selling his XRP investments after holding onto them for three years. He further explained that he was only selling XRP and no other cryptocurrencies or even Bitcoin. Rather, he was selling to be able to buy more later at a much cheaper price. Then in a follow-up post on May 20, Doctor Profit finally revealed his full plan when it comes to selling XRP. Apparently, the crypto trader had decided to dump all of his XRP in order to buy Ethereum, a move which he referred to as “a matter of capital appreciation.” The reason for this is because Doctor Profit believes that the Ethereum price could see a major increase in the near term. As for XRP, he explained that selling his stash did not mean that he expected the XRP price to crash. Rather, it was because holding XRP didn’t make sense in the short term and was a more long-term investment. Thus, he plans to take the gains made from the Ethereum investment and then reinvest them at a later date when a good entry is presented. But for now, Doctor Profit confirmed that all of the profits made from his XRP investment in the last three years have now been moved into Ethereum. Bullish Outlook For The Market Remains Back during the decline that plagued the crypto market from January to March 2025, Doctor Profit was one of the analysts who called the price bottom when Bitcoin had dropped to $77,000 . From there, the analyst had called that Bitcoin would rebound back above $100,000, maintaining that a new all-time high is possible. So far, his $100,000 prediction has come to pass, and the all-time high forecast was completed after Bitcoin breached $109,300 on Wednesday. For Ethereum, the analyst’s bullish thesis has been around for a while. He has previously called Ethereum the best opportunity as its technical, on-chain, and psychological indicators have turned bullish. He believes that the Ethereum price can rise as high as $7,600, with a lot of liquidity pooling around $4,000.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-trader-xrp-ethereum/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Ethereum|XRP|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT",cryptocompare
2025-05-22T13:30:00.000Z,"How staking incentivizes trust without burning energy","What if a financial system could run itself not by burning electricity, but by rewarding good behavior? That’s the promise of staking, a mechanism that powers many modern blockchains by turning users into network operators. In this week’s episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast , hosts Gareth Jenkinson and Nathan Jeffay sit down with StarkWare’s Noam Nisan to unpack how this trustless engine works, why it matters and what’s really at stake. Understanding staking Jeffay began by highlighting how staking is part of the backbone that keeps the blockchain running, and runs itself, with volunteers. “By doing this, they’re saying, OK, we’re taking this task of running the blockchain seriously. Here's some of our money. We're putting it down. We're showing that we're serious about doing this.” To help unpack this topic further and examine the deeper mechanics behind staking, the hosts are joined by Noam Nisan, principal researcher at StarkWare and a widely respected computer scientist who has held roles at Google and Princeton. Related: How to handle crypto trading gains and losses on your balance sheet “So we have this general system with operators... Why would they want to do that? The system, the protocol, incentivizes them to actually run the system,” Nisan explained. “Basically, it can give them tokens for operating the system.” Staking offers what Nisan describes as two distinct types of security: computer science-based guarantees and economic disincentives for bad actors. “If a majority or supermajority, maybe two-thirds of the parties of the token of the staked amount are behaving properly... we can prove that the system acts correctly,” he said. “But you also have what I would call an economic guarantee... if they destroy the system, very likely the value of the token... will go down. So they are the one losing.” PoW vs PoS Jenkinson, a vocal Bitcoin ( BTC ) supporter, posed the classic comparison: proof-of-work vs proof-of-stake. “Do you have any strong feelings about one or the other?” he asked. “The truth is that it’s not clear.. it's really a social question, I think.” Nisan noted that both mechanisms involve trade-offs around cost, control, and decentralization. The episode also explores the role of staking in tokenomics and system design. Nisan unpacks how fee mechanics and inflation controls, such as Ethereum’s minting curve, help keep the ecosystem in balance.

2025-05-22T13:27:13.000Z,"BTC News Analysis: Why Financial Experts Compare Bitcoin Solaris to Bitcoin Circa 2013","In 2013, Bitcoin was still an emerging digital asset with a small user base, minimal institutional exposure, and mining accessible from consumer-grade hardware. It was a period when network participation — not price speculation — was the primary driver of value accumulation. That phase gave early adopters long-term upside unmatched by nearly any asset class in the decade since. Now, a growing number of analysts are pointing to Bitcoin Solaris as the first credible protocol in years to recreate the mechanics that defined Bitcoin’s early trajectory. The comparison is not aesthetic or thematic. It’s based on structure: fixed supply, decentralized distribution, and real earnings tied to user activity. Mobile Mining Replaces Hardware Dependency Bitcoin Solaris allows users to mine BTC-S tokens directly from their smartphones through the Nova App. By allocating 1–5 GB of device storage and light background CPU usage, users will earn BTC-S passively — especially while devices are idle or charging. There is no staking mechanism, no validator configuration, and no reliance on token trading to receive rewards. This mirrors Bitcoin’s early mining economy, where participation rewarded technical contribution. The difference is accessibility. With Bitcoin Solaris, the requirement is not a GPU or ASIC — but a smartphone, making it feasible for millions of users globally to participate directly in the protocol. Infrastructure Built for Passive Income The blockchain is structured across two integrated layers. The Base Layer uses Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Capacity (PoC) to maintain ledger integrity efficiently. The Solaris Layer leverages Proof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Time (PoT) to execute mobile mining and smart contracts at 10,000+ TPS, with a finality time of 2 seconds. This design supports high-volume mining across thousands of nodes simultaneously and ensures that protocol rewards are distributed quickly, securely, and without congestion. It’s optimized not just for performance — but for continuous, low-friction earnings. BTC-S Presale Mirrors Early BTC Conditions Bitcoin Solaris is currently in Presale Phase 4, with BTC-S priced at 4 USDT. A total of 4.2 million BTC-S — 20% of the fixed 21 million supply — is allocated to presale participants. There is no inflation mechanism; future distribution will be governed strictly through mining or validator activity. Early buyers are not only accessing BTC-S at a fixed price—they’re securing network entry before Nova App mining begins. Once the app goes live, mining competition will increase, and token availability will decrease. The current presale offers an asymmetry similar to Bitcoin’s early distribution era, where those who engaged before market saturation saw long-term exponential returns. In a recent analysis, Crypto Volt highlights the structural parallels between Bitcoin in 2013 and Bitcoin Solaris today. The video outlines how Nova App mining, capped supply, and presale conditions offer a rare chance to replicate early-stage crypto dynamics — with the benefit of mobile-first design and audited infrastructure. Fully Audited and Verified Bitcoin Solaris has undergone comprehensive third-party verification to confirm the integrity of its smart contracts, token emission structure, and mobile mining architecture. A full audit conducted by Cyberscope reviewed the protocol’s contract logic and validated its compliance with emission parameters. A separate evaluation by Freshcoins examined system scalability, ensuring the infrastructure could reliably support high-volume mining and real-time transaction processing. The team has also completed KYC verification , providing transparency around governance and project oversight. These layers of independent review offer assurance that Bitcoin Solaris operates on verifiable code, not trust—critical for retail users entering before broader market exposure. Bitcoin’s 2013 phase was marked by low entry points, direct protocol rewards, and exponential upside for early participants. Bitcoin Solaris is now being compared to that period not for nostalgia, but for structure. It offers real earnings from a fixed-supply network, distributed via mobile mining, with the core mechanics already in place. Now in Phase 4 at 4 USDT, it remains one of the few retail-accessible opportunities in the current market cycle that resembles the conditions that built the first generation of crypto wealth.

2025-05-22T13:20:04.000Z,"Whale Makes Waves: $1.1B Bitcoin Long Shocks Hyperliquid Community","A whale recently took out a $1.1 billion leveraged long position on Bitcoin via the decentralized exchange (DEX) Hyperliquid. The enormous trade, reportedly made with 40x leverage, is believed to be the first time a position has crossed the billion-dollar threshold on the platform. The trader behind the audacious bet is believed to be “James Wynn,” a self-proclaimed high-risk leverage trader and memecoin enthusiast. According to on-chain data from Hypurrscan, Wynn used $28.4 million in margin to gradually build his position across multiple trades, with an average Bitcoin entry price of $108,065. At one point, the position was down by over $16 million before swinging into profit as Bitcoin surged past $110,000 on May 21 . The current liquidation price sits at $103,790 — a safe distance from the market’s current levels. “Absolute Mad Man” on Hyperliquid? The crypto community has been captivated by Wynn’s billion-dollar gamble. Reactions poured in on social media, with many praising the trader’s boldness. “He did it fellas. First position [on Hyperliquid] to exceed $1B,” said analyst Sigma^2. Others, like influencer Follis, remarked , “That mfer has nerves of steel.” While some were impressed, others questioned the wisdom of such a highly leveraged move in a notoriously volatile market. Still, Wynn seems to be reaping the rewards — and attention — as Bitcoin continues to rally. Data from HyperDash shows the whale began reducing parts of the position around the $106,000 mark on May 20, potentially locking in partial gains ahead of Bitcoin’s recent breakout. Who Is James Wynn? Little is known about Wynn beyond his digital footprint. He claims to have called the memecoin Pepe as a buy when its market cap was just $600,000 and refers to himself as a memecoin maximalist. Hypurrscan records show he began using Hyperliquid roughly two months ago, initially depositing $4.65 million worth of USDC. Since then, Wynn has made 32 trades, ranging from major tokens like XRP and Toncoin to highly speculative assets like Fartcoin and the “Official Trump” token. Hyperliquid — a rising DEX built on its own layer 1 blockchain — offers spot trading and DeFi lending, but this trade has cemented it in history as the scene of the largest known leveraged crypto position on-chain.

2025-05-22T13:19:19.000Z,"These 4 memecoins can outperform Bitcoin this cycle","Key takeaways: Memecoins like Fartcoin, WIF, SPX6900, and Popcat are outperforming Bitcoin in the short term amid renewed crypto market euphoria. Bullish technical patterns signal more upside for top-performing memecoins. Popcat stands out with a potential 350% rally, while Fartcoin and WIF also eye significant gains in the coming weeks. Bitcoin ( BTC ) has surged 7.35% over the past three days, hitting a new all-time high near $112,000 on May 22, but memecoins are stealing the spotlight. Fueled by BTC’s rally, several high-risk tokens are posting even larger gains, stoking possibilities that they could continue to outperform Bitcoin as the crypto bull run accelerates. Fartcoin ascending channel hints at more gains Solana-based Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) memecoin has surged 30% in the last three days to hit $1.57 as of May 22, its highest level in the last four months. The rally extends Fartcoin’s strong year-to-date (YTD) performance—up 74.50%—amid the ongoing memecoin frenzy . In comparison, Bitcoin has risen 18% so far in 2025. Technically, Fartcoin is trading within a well-defined ascending channel that began forming in early March, suggesting sustained bullish momentum. FARTCOIN/USDT daily price chart. Source: TradingView The memecoin has also broken above its 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA; the red wave), currently near $1.06, a key support level in uptrends. FARTCOIN’s relative strength index ( RSI ) was hovering near 64 as of May 22, suggesting there is room to run before selling conditions emerge near the overbought threshold at 70. If the uptrend holds, Fartcoin could retest the channel’s upper boundary near $2.74 by June, up 80% from the current price levels. Dogwifhat price could double Like FARTCOIN, Dogwifhat ( WIF ) has outperformed Bitcoin during the recent rally, up over 27% in the past three days. But the Solana memecoin has underperformed the top cryptocurrency year-to-date, down about 38%. But a bull pennant formation may put Dogwifhat in a position to catch up in the coming weeks. As of May 22, WIF’s price was testing the pennant’s upper trendline for a breakout, with its technical target at around $2.50, up about 125% from the current price levels. WIF/USDT daily price chart.

SPX6900 eyes 50% gains following breakout Ethereum-based SPX6900 (SPX6900) has surged 35% in the last three days, paring its 2025 losses. It is, therefore, underperforming Bitcoin on a YTD timeframe but, like WIF, shows the potential of outperforming BTC this cycle in percentage terms. At the core of this bullish outlook is SPX6900’s ongoing bullish reversal attempts. As of May 22, the memecoin had entered the breakout stage of its prevailing ascending triangle pattern, eyeing a rally toward $1.34 by June. SPX6900/USDT daily price chart.

2025-05-22T13:10:00.000Z,"Pi Network Price Prediction 2025-2031: Will Pi Price surpass previous ATH?","Key Takeaways: Pi price faces bearish pressure below the $0.86 level Our Pi price forecast expects the Pi price to surge to a maximum level of $4.34 in 2025. In 2031, Pi price prediction expects Pi price to reach a maximum level of $6.51. Since the last KYC verification deadline on March 14, 2025, expired, the Pi Network has been going through a period of instability. As a result of repeated delays, people who did not verify or send their Pi to the mainnet have no longer been able to access their Pi holdings. On Pi Day, the transition was completed, blockchain upgrades were introduced, and PiFest was launched to help more people use Pi. While some transfers went smoothly for users, others experienced problems and unexpected losses. These changes in the market have caused PI’s price to go up and down sharply. We will look at the Pi network price prediction for recent changes on Pi Network and examine the reaction of $PI’s price to predict future prices of its native token, $Pi. Overview Cryptocurrency Pi Network Ticker Symbol Pi Price $0.83481 Price Change 24h +3.7% Market Cap $6.01B Circulating Supply 7.22B PI Trading Volume 24h $314.21M All-Time High $2.98 (Feb 26, 2025) All-Time Low $0.4012 (Apr 05, 2025) Pi Network Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Current Price $ 0.83481 Price Prediction $ 2.77 (225.59%) Fear & Greed Index 72 (Greed) Sentiment Bullish Volatility 25.08% Green Days 15/30 (50%) 50-Day SMA – 200-Day SMA – 14-Day RSI 55.67 Pi Price Analysis Pi faces mixed volatility below $0.85. The MACD is negative, signaling a rising domination by sellers. The RSI drops from the overbought zone, showing failed buying pressure and market indecision. Pi price analysis 1-day chart: Pi Network surged toward $0.8686 but faced rejection In the past 24 hours, the Pi Network price has dropped trading at $0.8361. The price faces rejection below $0.8686 level, signaling limited buying strength. The RSI now stands at 53.39, hovering above the midline. This suggests a slight advantage for bulls to trigger a recovery rally. Pi/Usdt Price Chart on TradingView (1-day) Meanwhile, the MACD line has slipped below the signal line and is negative at -0.0075, suggesting a possible continuation of the short-term bearish pressure. Pi/USDT 4-hour price chart: Pi Network Holds in Tight Range on 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart for Pi Network price is slightly down to $0.8301. The price has been consolidating in a narrow range between $0.8284 and $0.8424, signaling reduced volatility and indecision among traders. Despite the minor drop, the market has not shown any aggressive selling or breakout momentum. Pi/Usdt Price Chart on TradingView (4-hour) The MACD remains slightly bullish at 0.0128 and the signal line at 0.0014, showing continued but weakening positive momentum. The bars, however, are starting to shorten, suggesting that bullish strength may be fading. If this trend continues, a bearish crossover could occur, prompting a short-term dip. Meanwhile, the RSI (14) stands at 57.54, down slightly from its recent high but still above the neutral 50 level. This indicates that buyers still have moderate control, although the strength appears to decrease gradually. Pi Network Price Prediction: Levels and Action Daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.88507 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.999111 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.905107 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.785486 BUY Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.757595 BUY EMA 5 $ 0.708056 BUY EMA 10 $ 0.684748 BUY EMA 21 $ 0.791148 BUY What to expect from Pi price analysis next? Pi’s price is likely to experience continued volatility shortly. If $PI fails to break and hold above the key resistance level around $0.90, the price may decline further toward support near $0.80. Weakening bullish momentum indicated by the MACD convergence and an RSI around 50 suggests sellers could gain control soon. A strong bounce from support levels could spark a short-term recovery attempt. A breakout above $0.90 or a sustained drop below support can confirm the next significant price direction. Is Pi A Good Investment? Pi Network has attracted over 60 million users, showing strong community interest and potential network growth. However, ongoing delays and access issues have caused concern among users about the project’s stability and future value. While some see promise in its unique mobile mining and Web 3.0 goals, many remain cautious, viewing Pi as a speculative investment at this stage. Why is the Pi Price Down Today? The Pi price is down today due to increased selling pressure after the recent deadline for KYC verification and token migration passed, causing many unverified users to lose access to their holdings. Will Pi Price Reach $5? If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $5 mark. Will Pi Reach $10? Depending on the current market sentiment, the PI price might take several years to reach the $10 milestone. We expect the Pi price to achieve $10 by 2033.

2025-05-22T13:06:31.000Z,"Strategy plans $2.1b preferred stock sale to fuel Bitcoin strategy","Strategy has unveiled plans to issue up to $2.1 billion in Series A Perpetual Preferred Stock, offering a 10% annual dividend. The sale will occur gradually through “at-the-market” offerings under SEC Rule 415(a)(4), giving the company flexibility to sell into favorable market conditions or via negotiated block trades. The proceeds, the company said , will go toward general corporate purposes, which may include additional Bitcoin ( BTC ) purchases. This move reinforces Strategy’s long-standing treasury policy of converting cash into BTC and positions it to increase its already record-setting holdings, now over 214,000 BTC. Unlike past funding rounds involving convertible notes, this time Strategy is tapping equity-like capital. Preferred stock doesn’t dilute common shareholder voting power but acts as a hybrid between debt and equity, offering fixed dividends — in this case, a notably high 10%. That yield reflects both the current interest rate environment and the risk investors perceive in backing a Bitcoin-heavy corporate strategy. You might also like: Volatility Shares launches first XRP futures ETF on Nasdaq Bitcoin as an investment vehicle This marks the latest in a series of financial maneuvers by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, who has turned Strategy into a de facto Bitcoin investment vehicle. By issuing preferred equity rather than traditional debt, the company avoids adding fixed repayment obligations — while still accessing billions in potential capital for BTC accumulation. The offering is also perpetual, meaning it has no maturity date. Investors receive dividends indefinitely, making it a long-term bet not just on Strategy, but on Bitcoin’s future. This fundraising signals Saylor’s unwavering commitment : if market conditions are right, Strategy is prepared to buy even more Bitcoin. You might also like: Missed the $10k to $100k ride?

2025-05-22T13:06:30.000Z,"What You Didn’t Know About Laszlo Hanyecz, the Bitcoin Pizza Day Legend","The skalds of Bitcoin Twitter have sung of the historic moment, the “first real world purchase” with bitcoin, and pundits have etched the story into the internet’s memory with headlines about the infamous Bitcoin Pizza Purchase, now dearly valued at more than $1 billion. But what if I told you that Hanyecz spent nearly 10 times more bitcoin following the historic purchase? And, what if I told you that perhaps Hanyecz did so as ostensible penance for his much more consequential contribution to Bitcoin in its uncertain infancy? He was a Bitcoin technical pioneer The penumbra of Hanyecz’s Pizza Day purchase has overshadowed his two seminal contributions to Bitcoin’s early technical development. This post originally appeared on Blockspace Media, where Colin Harper is editor-in-chief. The first of these came on April 19, 2010, just days after Hanyecz registered for Bitcointalk, a forum established by Satoshi Nakamoto that was (and still is) a watering hole for Bitcoin’s techie intelligentsia. Hanyecz created the first MacOS client for Bitcoin Core, the original and still-dominant software implementation for the nodes that underpin the Bitcoin network. Satoshi originally coded Bitcoin for Windows and Linux, but Hanyecz’s innovation enabled MacOS devices to run the software too. His contribution laid the foundation for all MacOS-enabled bitcoin wallets and applications that would follow it. But arguably greater than this was Hanyecz’s discovery that he could mine bitcoin with his computer’s graphics card (GPU). Until this point, early adopters used their computer processing units (CPUs) to mine bitcoin, and since GPUs are orders of magnitude more powerful than CPUs for the task, this innovation propelled bitcoin mining forward much faster than Satoshi expected. “Updated Mac OS X binary…It will use your GPU to generate bitcoins. This works really well if you have a good GPU like an NVIDIA 8800 or something like that,” Hanyecz wrote in a May 10, 2010 Bitcointalk post . The discovery ignited Bitcoin’s first digital gold rush. Bitcoin’s total hashrate exploded upward by 130,000% by the end of the year , and for the first time, bitcoin miners began constructing small-scale mining farms. These setups – slapped together in basements and attics, garages and sheds – were the prototypes for the industrial-scale bitcoin mining farms that dominate the Bitcoin network today. The Pizza was penance Hanyecz’s invention was so consequential that it earned him a virtual drop in from Satoshi Nakamoto himself. And it’s possible that the conversation that followed may have inspired Hanyecz’s famous Pizza Day purchase. “A big attraction to new users is that anyone with a computer can generate some free coins,” Satoshi wrote to Hanyecz. “GPUs would prematurely limit the incentive to only those with high-end GPU hardware. It’s inevitable that GPU compute clusters will eventually hog all the generated coins, but I don’t want to hasten that day.” In a 2019 interview for Bitcoin Magazine, Hanyecz told me that he “stopped advertising [GPU mining] after that.” “I was like, ‘Man, I feel like I crapped up your project. Sorry, dude.’ He was concerned that some people might be discouraged because they can’t mine a block with a CPU,” Hanyecz said. Perhaps this conversation spurred Hanyecz to offer 10,000 BTC for two large Papa John’s pizzas on that fateful day in May 15 years ago. In fact, he made the offer more than once. During the 2019 interview, Hanyecz told me that he spent nearly 100,000 BTC in the year that followed. “I spent [all my bitcoin] on pizza long ago,” Hanyecz wrote in a February 2014 Bitcointalk post . “Other than a little bit of single digit change, I spent everything I mined. As you all know, the difficulty rises to adjust to hashing power, so eventually the mining wasn't worth it for me.” Looking at a Bitcoin address Hanyecz listed on his first Bitcointalk post, Hanyecz received and spent 81,432 BTC from this address from April to November 2010. This sum would be worth just over $8.6 billion today. Laszlo Hanyecz’s wallet 2010 balance history | Source: Mempool.space There’s no way to verify if Hanyecz spent all of this on pizza, other goods, or if he simply gave bitcoin away to new Bitcointalk members, a common practice back then when bitcoin was close-to worthless. But he did mention in his original thread for the pizza purchase that it was “an open offer,” although he reneged on this in August saying, “I can't really afford to keep doing it since I can't generate thousands of coins a day anymore. Thanks to everyone who bought me pizza already.” The original purchase, let alone the recurring ones that apparently occurred after, would be enough to keep any sane person awake at night as bitcoin marches above $100,000. But in 2019 at least, Hanyecz stomached the ordeal with good humor. As he saw it, he committed culinary alchemy, transmuting his electricity and computing power into a cheap dinner. He had no idea that bitcoin would command the price it does today, so the transaction was a victory in his book. “A trade happens because both parties think they’re getting a good deal,” he said. “I felt like I was beating the internet, getting free food. I was like, ‘Man, I got these GPUs linked together, now I’m going to mine twice as fast. I’m just going to be eating free food; I’ll never have to buy food again...\"" \""I mean, I coded this thing and mined bitcoin and I felt like I was winning the internet that day. I got pizza for contributing to an open-source project. Usually hobbies are a time sink and money sink, and in this case, my hobby bought me dinner.”",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/05/22/what-you-didnt-know-about-laszlo-hanyecz-the-bitcoin-pizza-day-legend,"BTC|FIAT|MINING|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING","Tech|Feature",cryptocompare

2025-05-22T13:00:44.000Z,"Pi Network Faces Centralization Power as Vietnam Dominates Its Node Activity","The post Pi Network Faces Centralization Power as Vietnam Dominates Its Node Activity appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Pi Network was built to be a global, decentralized project that gives power back to the people. But right now, it’s facing a serious challenge, too much of its network is controlled by one country. At the heart of the issue is Vietnam, which now hosts nearly half of all Pi Network nodes, raising flags about the fairness and long-term resilience of the project. Can Pi Network still live up to its promise, or is it slowly turning into something it was never meant to be? Let’s dive in detail! Vietnam Hosts Nearly Half of Pi’s Nodes According to recent data, Vietnam controls 154 out of 319 global Pi nodes, making up over 48% of the network. Even more, 33 of the 76 currently active nodes are in the country. This means almost half the network depends on one country and that’s risky. If something goes wrong in Vietnam, like internet blocks or new laws, it could cause major problems for the whole network. Strict Crypto Laws in Vietnam Adding to the complexity, Vietnam’s legal stance on cryptocurrencies like Pi Coin is far from friendly. The country’s laws don’t recognize Pi as a legal payment option. In fact, authorities have made it clear that using Pi for transactions could lead to a fine of 50 million VND to 100 million VND (about $2,000 to $4,000) or even face criminal charges. On top of that, Vietnam’s Ministry of Finance has proposed new rules to allow only licensed institutions to hold and manage crypto. If passed, this could heavily impact local Pi miners and node operators. Centralization Goes Beyond Geography The concerns don’t stop with location. According to Piscan, over 60.7 billion Pi Coins (out of 100 billion) are held by the Pi Foundation’s wallets. That’s more than 60% of all the tokens in the hands of the core team. Even worse, Pi Network has only two validator nodes , and both are owned by the core team. This setup is far from decentralized and leaves little control to the actual users. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Exclusive: Is Pi Network a Pump and Dump? Expert Explains the Crash, Backlash, and Scam Rumors , The Community Is Getting Worried Some users are already speaking up. One Reddit user wrote, “So long as the team holds some coins, it will never be decentralized.” Others have warned about possible insider selling and scam tokens copying Pi’s name to steal data or money. On March 2, Hanoi City police warned people about risky hype around Pi, especially after it started getting attention on exchanges. Officials said the network is being promoted with “unrealistic promises” and that many people don’t understand the real risks. If Pi truly wants to be a people-powered network, it must take urgent steps to reduce control from one region and one team. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-22T12:55:59.000Z,"U.S. Stablecoin Bill Approval Could Trigger a Long-Term Crypto Bull Market: Bitwise","Progress on the stablecoin bill in the U.S. could lead to a multi-year crypto bull market, asset manager Bitwise said in a report Tuesday. The Senate agreed to advance the GENIUS Act to a final vote on Monday, the report noted, which means that the U.S. could pass its first piece of crypto legislation this summer. \""Outside of the January 2024 approval of spot bitcoin ETFs , this is the most important regulatory development in the history of crypto. It may even be bigger,\"" wrote Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is tied to another asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold. They play a major role in cryptocurrency markets and are also used to transfer money internationally. The Senate's Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act mandates federal regulation for stablecoins with a market cap of over $10 billion with the potential for state regulation if it aligns with federal rules. The House of Representatives' STABLE Act calls for state regulation without any conditions. Bitwise noted that stablecoin issuers have to follow a number of regulations but there is no \""overarching federal framework.\"" The GENIUS Act provides that regulatory framework. Once approved, this could set the stage for a long-term rally in crypto assets other than just bitcoin BTC, Bitwise said, and the biggest potential beneficiaries are ether ETH, solana SOL and decentralized finance (DeFi) assets such as uniswap UNI and aave AAVE. The stablecoin market could reach $2.5 trillion in size in no time, from $245 billion currently, the report added.

The hacker swapped $42.5 million worth of Bitcoin for Ethereum (ETH) via ThorChain to launder the stolen funds. Hacker mocks blockchain researcher ZachXBT following Bitcoin (BTC) Etheruem swap The hacker sent an on-chain message to ZachXBT using Ethereum transaction login data that included the phrase “L bozo” and then posted a meme video of NBA player James Worthy smoking a cigar. ZachXBT flagged the message on his Telegram channel, writing that the wallet that handles the BTC-ETH exchange is associated with the hacker responsible for the Coinbase data breach that affected at least 69,400 users. The Coinbase data breach, first reported in a filing with the Maine Attorney General's Office, occurred in December 2024 but was uncovered on May 11. Coinbnase stated that the stolen data included names, home addresses and other personal information, while the hackers demanded a ransom of $20 million in Bitcoin for the release of the stolen data. However, Coinbase refused to pay the ransom and instead offered a $20 million reward for information leading to the identification of the hackers. Coinbase estimates that the data breach could cost them up to $400 million, while the U.S. Department of Justice has launched a formal investigation into the breach. *This is not investment advice.

Solana coin price could reach a potential high of $400 in 2025. With a potential surge, the SOL price could hit $1,351 by 2030. Solana is coming true to its community-claimed title, “Ethereum-Killer,” as it gradually surpasses Ethereum in the decentralized market. In a recent feat, Solana’s TVL crossed $10.9 billion, influenced by fee growth, increased staking, and rising DeFi use cases. However, with the ongoing volatility amid the cryptocurrency market crash, the Solana price currently trades at a discount of 39.56% from its ATH of $ 294.33. Following this, crypto investors are storming Google with questions like “Will Solana Go Back Up?” or “How high can Solana go?” and “Will SOL price reach $500 this altcoin season?” To answer more such questions, we bring to you our Solana price prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030. We’ll address these queries using our analyses, market sentiments, and regular updates from the crypto world.

The RSI is above 50, reflecting building momentum. Price is trading above the 9-day SMA, suggesting bullish sentiment. Consolidation at the current $180 range may precede a breakout. Watch for resistance near $193, a push above which could take the SOL price to $220. The start of an altseason could take SOL to $250 by the end of June. Potential High: $250 Average Price Range: $200 Potential Low: $180 Solana Price Prediction 2025 According to Defillama , Solana’s dapp revenue has shot up over $50 million with a market share of 51.6%. On the other hand, the open interest against the price is at $6.9 billion. These strong on-chain metrics could play a pivotal role in pushing the SOL price to greater highs. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400.

2025-05-22T12:24:53.000Z,"Bitcoin trades above $110,000 as US ETF inflows surge 85%","Bitcoin crossed the $110,000 threshold for the first time on Wednesday, triggering renewed interest from US-based investors. The price action coincided with a sharp rise in inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, which jumped 85% in a single day to reach $609 million. The increased activity points to rising institutional and retail demand from US markets, with analysts tracking a positive shift in sentiment as the coin eyes new highs. This resurgence comes after weeks of consolidation, suggesting that Bitcoin’s upward momentum is being reinforced by macro-level support from regulated investment products and investor appetite across exchanges. Premium Index hits 24-day high On-chain data from CryptoQuant shows that the Coinbase Premium Index (CPI) spiked to its highest level in 24 days as BTC broke above $110,000. This metric tracks the price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase and Binance, offering insight into regional demand dynamics. When CPI is above zero, it suggests strong buying pressure from US investors. A negative reading reflects muted interest or sell-offs in US markets. The recent spike indicates that traders on Coinbase were willing to pay a premium, showing bullish sentiment tied to American investor behaviour. ETF inflows keep rising The inflow into spot Bitcoin ETFs reached $609 million on Wednesday, up from $329.02 million the previous day. This marks six straight days of net positive flows, indicating growing interest in regulated investment products tied to BTC. This surge in capital into ETFs comes amid broader optimism around Bitcoin’s long-term potential, following earlier hesitation in the first quarter of 2025. Increased regulatory clarity and improving market conditions have contributed to this trend, making ETFs a key vehicle for traditional investors entering the crypto space. The momentum in ETF investments is helping to reinforce BTC’s recent rally, particularly among institutional participants who prefer regulated exposure to volatile assets. BTC price: technical outlook At the time of writing, BTC trades at $111,084, just below its all-time high of $111,888. Source: CoinMarketCap According to daily chart data, Bitcoin’s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) stands at 0.30, indicating capital inflows remain strong. A CMF reading above zero points to net buying activity, supporting the thesis that traders are accumulating rather than exiting positions. If this momentum persists, BTC may reclaim its recent high and establish a new price record. However, a downside correction remains possible if profit-taking intensifies. In that scenario, analysts suggest a short-term dip towards $103,882 as a potential support level. Macro and ETF trends in focus The coordinated rise in both CPI and ETF inflows underscores the role of the US market in shaping Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory. While global liquidity and investor sentiment continue to evolve, the data suggests that demand from US institutions and retail traders remains a dominant driver of price movements. As long as ETF inflows stay positive and technical indicators reflect accumulation, the bullish case for BTC remains intact. However, traders are also monitoring potential headwinds from macroeconomic shifts or regulatory updates, which could influence market dynamics in the coming weeks.

2025-05-22T12:22:10.000Z,"Bitcoin miners’ record sales preceded rally - what’s next for supply?","In April 2025, Bitcoin miners sold more BTC than they produced - about 115% of their monthly output. That’s a big deal. It means miners had to dip into their reserves, signaling financial pressure across the industry. Despite Bitcoin trading near $111,000 - close to its all-time high - the economics of mining have gotten tougher. The 2024 halving slashed rewards, and rising energy costs have squeezed profits. Many miners took the opportunity to sell while prices were high, helping them stay afloat. This wave of selling added a lot of Bitcoin to the market, boosting trading volumes and triggering short-term price swings. Some traders saw it as a bearish signal, while others - especially institutions - used the sell-off to buy more. ETF inflows stayed strong, showing long-term confidence. Miners are adapting. They’re upgrading to more efficient machines, hunting for cheaper or renewable energy, and even offering services like AI computing. Still, some are being forced to sell more frequently, especially those with older setups or in regions with high costs. What’s next? With fewer new coins entering circulation and more BTC moving to cold storage, supply is tightening. That could help support prices in the long run. But keep an eye on miner reserves, regulation changes, and whether institutions keep buying. Those will be key drivers for Bitcoin going forward.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9224/bitcoin-miners-record-sales-preceded-rally-what-s-next-for-supply,"BTC|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-05-22T12:14:26.000Z,"Bitcoin Rally Is Still Healthy Despite New ATH: On-Chain Data","Bitcoin (BTC) surged past $111,000 for the first time on Thursday, marking a historic all-time high. The rally is being driven by strong capital inflows, particularly from institutional investors. Despite concerns of a pullback, new data suggest that the Bitcoin market is still in a healthy upward phase. Market Calm as Bitcoin Soars According to a report by CryptoQuant, the funding rate, which is commonly used to gauge speculative pressure, shows a recent uptick in long positions, but the scale remains modest when compared to previous market tops. Similarly, data on coins traded within a 1-week to 1-month timeframe, which is often used to assess short-term capital inflows, indicates that current inflows are relatively subdued, especially when measured against the rapid influxes seen during earlier bull runs. Notably, short-term holders have shown little inclination to take profits amid the recent rally. In contrast to the heavy profit-taking that triggered a correction in March 2024 and again in November 2024, current selling pressure remains limited, even among large whale accounts. Additionally, Bitcoin holdings in US-listed spot ETFs have also reached record highs, reflecting strong demand from investors. Overall, CryptoQuant believes that the current rally is being driven by sustainable factors as overheating signals remain relatively muted. Institutions Take the Lead Bitcoin’s latest ATH appears to be structurally different from past retail-driven rallies, according to experts. In a statement to CryptoPotato , Kushal Manupati, Binance’s Regional Growth & Ops Lead of South Asia, also echoed a similar sentiment. “Bitcoin has surged past the $111,000 mark, setting a new all-time high and reinforcing its position as the bellwether of the virtual digital assets revolution. This exponential rally is the result of increasing institutional participation, maturing global regulations, and growing mainstream recognition of Bitcoin as a legitimate store of value. From a technological curiosity to a globally held asset, Bitcoin’s rise has been powered by transparency.” Instead of speculative hype, the current uptrend is fueled by disciplined institutional accumulation, Santiment said in its update , while highlighting six consecutive days of ETF inflows and reduced retail FOMO as signs of a maturing market. The standout performer is BlackRock’s spot ETF, IBIT, which now holds over 636,000 BTC, which, interestingly, happens to be more than the next 14 U.S. spot ETFs combined. Institutional giants like Mubadala and Citadel are increasing exposure through IBIT. Meanwhile, corporate buyers like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet continued to ramp up their BTC holdings with more purchases. With Bitcoin gaining over 25% in the past 30 days and nearly 60% year-over-year, Santiment expects the rally could extend to $115K-$120K. Meanwhile, the low retail interest may be contributing to the rally’s stability, creating a clear runway for institutional capital to lead the charge.

2025-05-22T13:39:15.000Z,"Exponential currency debasement: ‘You don’t own enough crypto, NFTs’","Cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can help investors protect their eroding purchasing power during an era of exponential currency debasement, according to analysts and industry leaders.Investing in digital assets is becoming increasingly important in the “world of the exponential age and currency debasement,” according to Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Global Macro Investor.“You don’t own enough crypto. When you do, you don’t own enough NFT’s, as art is upstream of wealth. Both will never be this cheap again,” Pal said.NFTs are “the single best long term store of wealth I know and you get to buy it before network effects kick in,” he added in another response.Source: Raoul Pal“There is some validity to the statement that NFTs, and in extension art, become a vehicle for the wealthy once a certain level of wealth is reached,” wrote Nicolai Sondergaard, research analyst at Nansen, calling it a “natural move” for asset diversification.“For traders and investors, further down the wealth curve, NFTs are partially about speculating on future returns,” he told Cointelegraph, adding that NFTs also benefit from the allure of strong communities, beyond just wealth creation.Related: German gov’t missed out on $2.3B profit after selling Bitcoin at $57KArt NFTs may see a resurgence as “digital ownership gains acceptance among younger, tech-savvy cohorts,” if collections manage to move past the “speculative fervor,” according to Anndy Lian, author and intergovernmental blockchain expert.Still, Lian said broader adoption depends on blockchain networks improving scalability and security to “instill confidence.” He added that art NFTs “must transcend hype, anchoring value in cultural significance or utility.”  Beeple’s “Everydays: The First 5000 Days.” Source: ChristiesSome digital artists made millions of dollars through NFTs.

2025-05-22T13:30:00.000Z,"How staking incentivizes trust without burning energy","What if a financial system could run itself not by burning electricity, but by rewarding good behavior? That’s the promise of staking, a mechanism that powers many modern blockchains by turning users into network operators. In this week’s episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Gareth Jenkinson and Nathan Jeffay sit down with StarkWare’s Noam Nisan to unpack how this trustless engine works, why it matters and what’s really at stake.Understanding stakingJeffay began by highlighting how staking is part of the backbone that keeps the blockchain running, and runs itself, with volunteers.“By doing this, they’re saying, OK, we’re taking this task of running the blockchain seriously. Here's some of our money. We're putting it down. We're showing that we're serious about doing this.”To help unpack this topic further and examine the deeper mechanics behind staking, the hosts are joined by Noam Nisan, principal researcher at StarkWare and a widely respected computer scientist who has held roles at Google and Princeton.Related: How to handle crypto trading gains and losses on your balance sheet“So we have this general system with operators... Why would they want to do that? The system, the protocol, incentivizes them to actually run the system,” Nisan explained. “Basically, it can give them tokens for operating the system.”Staking offers what Nisan describes as two distinct types of security: computer science-based guarantees and economic disincentives for bad actors. “If a majority or supermajority, maybe two-thirds of the parties of the token of the staked amount are behaving properly... we can prove that the system acts correctly,” he said. “But you also have what I would call an economic guarantee... if they destroy the system, very likely the value of the token... will go down. So they are the one losing.”PoW vs PoSJenkinson, a vocal Bitcoin (BTC) supporter, posed the classic comparison: proof-of-work vs proof-of-stake. “Do you have any strong feelings about one or the other?” he asked.“The truth is that it’s not clear.. it's really a social question, I think.”Nisan noted that both mechanisms involve trade-offs around cost, control, and decentralization. The episode also explores the role of staking in tokenomics and system design. Nisan unpacks how fee mechanics and inflation controls, such as Ethereum’s minting curve, help keep the ecosystem in balance.To hear the full conversation on The Clear Crypto Podcast,  listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

Fueled by BTC’s rally, several high-risk tokens are posting even larger gains, stoking possibilities that they could continue to outperform Bitcoin as the crypto bull run accelerates.Fartcoin ascending channel hints at more gainsSolana-based Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) memecoin has surged 30% in the last three days to hit $1.57 as of May 22, its highest level in the last four months.The rally extends Fartcoin’s strong year-to-date (YTD) performance—up 74.50%—amid the ongoing memecoin frenzy. In comparison, Bitcoin has risen 18% so far in 2025.Technically, Fartcoin is trading within a well-defined ascending channel that began forming in early March, suggesting sustained bullish momentum.FARTCOIN/USDT daily price chart. Source: TradingViewThe memecoin has also broken above its 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA; the red wave), currently near $1.06, a key support level in uptrends.FARTCOIN’s relative strength index (RSI) was hovering near 64 as of May 22, suggesting there is room to run before selling conditions emerge near the overbought threshold at 70. If the uptrend holds, Fartcoin could retest the channel’s upper boundary near $2.74 by June, up 80% from the current price levels.Dogwifhat price could doubleLike FARTCOIN, Dogwifhat (WIF) has outperformed Bitcoin during the recent rally, up over 27% in the past three days. But the Solana memecoin has underperformed the top cryptocurrency year-to-date, down about 38%.But a bull pennant formation may put Dogwifhat in a position to catch up in the coming weeks.

It is, therefore, underperforming Bitcoin on a YTD timeframe but, like WIF, shows the potential of outperforming BTC this cycle in percentage terms.At the core of this bullish outlook is SPX6900’s ongoing bullish reversal attempts.

2025-05-22T12:38:44.000Z,"UK court partially dismisses Bitcoin SV investor’s lawsuit against Binance","The United Kingdom’s Court of Appeal has partially dismissed a lawsuit brought by Bitcoin SV investors against major crypto exchanges, including Binance, for allegedly conspiring to delist the token in 2019.In a judgment handed down on May 21, the court ruled that investors who held BSV through the delisting period (classified as “sub-class B”) were not entitled to billions in speculative damages based on BSV’s hypothetical growth.These investors had claimed over 8.9 billion British pounds ($11.9 billion) in damages, asserting that Binance’s delisting deprived holders of the chance to profit from BSV’s potential rise to a “top-tier cryptocurrency” like Bitcoin (BTC) or Bitcoin Cash (BCH).The court rejected this “foregone growth effect” theory, stating, “BSV was obviously not a unique cryptocurrency without reasonably similar substitutes,” pointing to the representative’s own use of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash as comparators.Sub-class B’s central claim was that delisting led to a missed opportunity to benefit from price appreciation. However, the court determined that those investors had ample chance to mitigate losses by selling or reinvesting in other crypto assets.“They had a duty to mitigate their losses,” wrote Master of the Rolls Sir Geoffrey Vos. “They cannot recover losses that they could reasonably have mitigated.”UK court ruling against Bitcoin SV investor’s lawsuit. Source: CaselawRelated: Bitcoin SV investors attempt to resurrect 2019 Binance lawsuitCourt strikes down “loss of a chance” argumentThe appeal also challenged the Tribunal’s application of the “market mitigation rule,” arguing that such issues should be left for trial.The court dismissed that notion, stating the rule clearly applies to freely tradable assets like BSV, and that the damages must be measured shortly after the delisting.An additional argument concerning the “loss of a chance” to benefit from future price gains was also struck down. The court ruled it “flawed as a matter of principle,” noting that “cryptocurrencies are, by their nature, volatile investments.”Binance’s limited strike-out application ultimately succeeded, with the court stating that even if some holders were unaware of the delisting, “they could never claim more than the total value of their holding before the delisting events plus any quantifiable consequential losses.”Related: Binance wants arbitration for all members of securities class suitBinance seeks to dismiss FTX lawsuitOn May 16, Binance filed a motion to dismiss a $1.76 billion lawsuit filed by the FTX estate, arguing that the claims are legally flawed and an attempt to shift responsibility for FTX’s collapse.The exchange stated the downfall of FTX stemmed from internal fraud, not external manipulation, citing Sam Bankman-Fried’s conviction on multiple fraud charges.Binance has asked the court to dismiss all claims with prejudice.

2025-05-22T10:21:18.000Z,"Can ChatGPT-powered AI agents really trade crypto for you?","Key takeawaysChatGPT-powered AI agents automate trading tasks using natural language prompts and API integrations, improving speed and consistency.Successes occur when ChatGPT is used as a support tool, not a fully autonomous trading system.Failures happen when traders over-rely on ChatGPT without real-time data, proper risk management or manual oversight.Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance.What if a crypto trader didn’t need to constantly check charts, worry about emotions, or stay up all night watching for sudden price swings? What if those tasks could be handled by an intelligent agent that understands instructions in plain English — and reacts within milliseconds? That’s where ChatGPT-powered AI agents come in.These tools combine natural language processing with real-time trading logic to automate decision-making in one of the world’s most volatile markets. From rebalancing portfolios to reacting to market sentiment, ChatGPT is being adapted to act as a trading assistant, risk manager and market analyst — all rolled into one. But can it truly match or even outperform human intuition? This article explores how far these agents have come, where they shine and where they still fall short.How ChatGPT-powered AI agents operate in cryptocurrency marketsChatGPT-powered AI agents are changing how people interact with crypto markets. These tools combine ChatGPT’s language abilities with external trading tools and APIs to help users monitor prices, understand trends and even place trades automatically. Instead of just reacting to charts or numbers, ChatGPT can understand plain language commands like “Buy Ethereum if the price drops below $2,000” or “Sell Bitcoin if RSI goes above 70.”These AI trading assistants can work with major platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, OKX and other centralized or decentralized exchanges and can also tap into decentralized finance (DeFi) tools and smart contracts. With the right setup, ChatGPT can help automate trading strategies based on both technical data and market news.Success stories vs. failures in ChatGPT-powered crypto tradingSome traders have used ChatGPT to assist in automating parts of their crypto trading processes, particularly for strategy generation and sentiment analysis. For example, a user shared on Reddit that they used a ChatGPT-based AI agent for technical analysis on Ether (ETH), feeding it four-hour and daily chart screenshots. By interpreting market sentiment, support and resistance zones, and other indicators, they managed to make $6,500 in profits.Similarly, in the broader crypto sector, ChatGPT has been applied to support project development activities such as drafting white papers and marketing content. A notable example is the launch of the “TURBO” memecoin, which reportedly reached a market capitalization of over $50 million in 2024. In this case, ChatGPT was used to streamline documentation and communication rather than manage trading activity, illustrating its usefulness as a support tool in crypto-related initiatives.However, limitations are evident when ChatGPT is applied beyond its core design. While ChatGPT could suggest a trading portfolio and explain its reasoning clearly, it lacks access to real-time market data and couldn’t respond to sudden volatility. In one instance, ChatGPT was allocated $100 across multiple tokens but failed to actively manage the portfolio as prices fluctuated. This resulted in missed opportunities and underperformance compared to dynamic algorithmic strategies.Individual experiences reinforce these observations. A Redditor exposed a scam where a YouTuber promoted a “ChatGPT trading bot” tutorial that led users to deploy malicious smart contracts. The contracts, generated using ChatGPT and passed off as safe, were designed to drain user wallets once funded. Victims collectively lost $17,240 in ETH, highlighting the danger of blindly trusting AI-generated code without proper auditing.Even when asked, “If I use ChatGPT to build an AI agent for crypto trading, can I become a millionaire?” ChatGPT responded with a realistic outlook — acknowledging that while it’s possible, success depends on having a profitable strategy, disciplined risk management, and the ability to scale effectively.Here is ChatGPT’s response:These cases suggest that while ChatGPT can support certain elements of the trading process, it should not be treated as a standalone solution for autonomous crypto trading.AI in crypto trading: Key benefits and limitationsAI tools like ChatGPT are increasingly being integrated into crypto trading workflows to improve speed, accuracy and efficiency. While they offer important advantages, they also carry specific limitations that traders must actively manage. Below are the main benefits and challenges:Key benefits of using AI for crypto tradingAI bots can execute trades in milliseconds, crucial for capturing opportunities in fast-moving crypto markets.Bots follow pre-programmed rules precisely, eliminating emotional biases that often affect human traders.Crypto markets are always open, and AI bots can monitor and act around the clock without interruption.A single bot can manage multiple trading pairs, exchanges and strategies simultaneously.ChatGPT can understand specific prompts like “Rebalance every Monday” or “Set stop-loss at 5%,” allowing flexible automation.Limitations of ChatGPT in cryptocurrency tradingChatGPT does not access live market data unless specifically integrated with external APIs (e.g., TradingView, CoinMarketCap or exchange websockets).Instructions must be clear and unambiguous; ChatGPT may misinterpret vague or complex commands.Improperly secured API keys or lack of two-factor authentication (2FA) can expose trading accounts to unauthorized access.ChatGPT’s cloud-based infrastructure can introduce latency, which could impact performance during highly volatile periods.ChatGPT does not monitor regional compliance rules; users must manually enforce trading limits based on local regulations.Ethical and regulatory implications of AI in crypto tradingAs AI becomes more integrated into trading systems, it raises significant ethical and regulatory concerns that stakeholders across the financial sector are beginning to address.Accountability: If an AI agent executes a harmful or unlawful trade, questions arise around legal responsibility. It remains unclear in many jurisdictions whether liability falls primarily on the developer, the trader using the AI system or the platform facilitating the transactions.Market manipulation risks: Autonomous AI bots could unintentionally engage in activities such as spoofing (placing and canceling fake orders to mislead the market) or wash trading (creating artificial volume), especially if not properly programmed with compliance safeguards.Regulatory oversight: Financial authorities, including the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the European Securities and Markets Authority, are actively studying the implications of AI and algorithmic trading. These agencies have recognized that traditional trading regulations may not fully account for autonomous decision-making by AI systems.Policy developments: In January 2024, the European Commission released updates to its Digital Finance Strategy, which included references to AI-based financial services. While not yet finalized, these draft regulations under the broader Digital Finance Package signal a move toward stricter compliance expectations for firms deploying AI in financial markets.Meanwhile, ethical crypto platforms are beginning to voluntarily disclose the use of trading bots in their systems. In parallel, open-source communities are advocating for clearer audit trails, improved model transparency and the establishment of ethical guidelines for AI applications in finance to ensure accountability and fairness.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Crypto travelers are also outspending their fiat counterparts, with an average booking value of  $1,211 per transaction, over 2.5 times more than fiat users who spend $469.Additionally, the report said crypto users were three times more valuable over their lifetime due to longer stays and higher repeat bookings, with crypto travelers 57% more likely to make a repeat hotel purchase.Source: Binance Pay, TravalaJuan Otero, CEO of Travala, attributed these travel preferences to the flexible nature of Web3 jobs:“Many also work in the digital asset industry or have flexible, remote work lifestyles, which makes them more likely to travel frequently and stay in one place for longer while seeking out destinations that support seamless, global payments.”Crypto-based transactions have become more common in the travel sector and beyond. Airlines that have integrated digital currencies into their booking systems have seen a 40% boost in bookings, with travel and hospitality representing 14% of all crypto transactions in 2024, according to a Feb. 21 report by Triple-A.Related: Crypto spending will grow, but fiat isn’t going anywhere: Mercuryo CEOThe main benefit of using crypto for travel is its borderless, global utility, Jonathan Lim, the global head of Binance Pay, told Cointelegraph. “Travelers can skip currency exchange lines, avoid foreign transaction fees, and pay instantly using assets they already hold,” he added.A growing number of crypto users also drives the increase in travelers using crypto to pay for trips. Triple-A’s report shows that cryptocurrency ownership has a compound annual growth rate of 99%, significantly outpacing the growth of traditional payment methods. Among crypto owners, 65% express interest in using it for payments.Founded in 2017, Travala is among the most popular crypto-native travel platforms, which enables users to pay for services like flights, hotel stays and tours with 141 different cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC) and USDC (USDC) via Binance Pay. Related: Bhutan launches tourism crypto payments with Binance Pay and DK BankCrypto payment covers more and more retail industriesThe first real-world Bitcoin transaction — 10,000 BTC for two pizzas — occurred 15 years ago today, on May 22, 2010, now commemorated as Bitcoin Pizza Day.

2025-05-22T09:01:43.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Forecast - Also Using Liquidation Levels","<p>Bitcoin Price Forecast </p><p>In short, I am watching $117k - $119k on the Bitcoin futures. Now I apologize for the next video not having audio due to a technical issue being looked into, but I am sure most of you with a will, will find a way, and see why.</p><p>Now you will note in the chart within the video, also shown below, that we have that little grey line for an expected price level of liquadation at $115,500. I explain what this means further below.</p><p>Understanding Liquidation Levels and How They Influence Bitcoin Price Forecast</p><p>For Bitcoin traders and investors, understanding liquidation levels—especially those linked to large positions—is crucial. Liquidations can dramatically influence short-term price movements, triggering swift and often volatile market reactions.</p><p>What Does 'Liquidation' Actually Mean?</p><p>In cryptocurrency futures trading, liquidation occurs when a trader's leveraged position is closed automatically by the exchange because the position's margin is no longer sufficient to cover potential losses. Traders holding leveraged long positions (expecting price to rise) will face liquidation if the price moves significantly lower. Conversely, leveraged short positions (expecting prices to drop) face liquidation if prices rise significantly.</p><p>What Is 'Cumulative Short Liquidation Leverage'?</p><p>The \""cumulative short liquidation leverage\"" refers to the total amount of short positions that could be forcibly closed if Bitcoin's price hits a certain level. When the price approaches these liquidation points, shorts become at risk of being liquidated, forcing these traders to buy Bitcoin at market prices to cover their positions. This forced buying adds upward pressure on prices, often triggering even higher spikes.</p><p>Why Bitcoin Traders (and Investors) Should Care</p><p>These liquidation levels act as magnets or significant pivot points in price action. Let's consider two critical liquidation zones for Bitcoin based on recent data:</p><ul><li><p>Above Current Price: At around $115,549, approximately 3.75k BTC worth of short positions could be liquidated. This forced buying could push prices rapidly higher, creating momentum that attracts additional buyers.</p></li><li><p>Below Current Price: A notable zone between approximately $96,000 and $97,335 shows significant potential liquidations of leveraged long positions. If Bitcoin prices drop into this range, substantial selling could be triggered, rapidly pushing prices lower.</p></li></ul><p>How Liquidations Can Propel BTC Futures Price Further</p><p>When a large liquidation occurs (let's say short liquidation at a higher price), traders holding shorts must rapidly buy Bitcoin at the market price to cover their positions. This buying activity creates immediate upward pressure, potentially triggering additional liquidations of other short sellers, causing prices to spike even higher.</p><p>Moreover, these rapid price movements attract momentum traders, scalpers, and short-term speculators who ride the trend further upwards. However, caution is necessary: significant liquidation points often become attractive levels for larger, savvy traders to take profits. Thus, it's common to witness price spiking above critical liquidation levels, followed by a reversal or at least a retest of previously broken resistance or support.</p><p>Key Trading Guidance for Bitcoin Traders</p><ul><li><p>Do Not Treat Liquidation Levels as Precise Reversal Points: Instead, anticipate potential overshoots. Price often moves beyond these levels due to the aggressive market orders and new entrants drawn by the momentum.</p></li><li><p>Expect Potential Reversals Post-Liquidation Spikes: Often, sharp moves above resistance (or below support) are temporary, leading to a reversal as profit-takers seek new buyers or sellers entering at extreme prices.</p></li><li><p>Stay Alert to Retests: After a liquidation-driven breakout, watch carefully if prices return to test the previously significant level—often a key indicator of the next market direction.</p></li></ul><p>Why Track Whales Specifically?</p><p>While standard liquidation maps provide helpful insights, focusing on whale or large institutional positions offers enhanced predictive value. Large traders typically hold sizable positions with significant market impact. Their liquidation points, therefore, are more likely to trigger noticeable price movements, setting off cascades of secondary liquidations and momentum-driven trades. By tracking these larger positions, traders gain clearer insights into potentially explosive market dynamics and critical price thresholds.</p><p>In summary, understanding liquidation dynamics, especially those involving significant \""whale\"" positions, gives Bitcoin traders a vital edge. Remain vigilant around key liquidation zones, anticipate temporary volatility spikes, and prepare for potential reversals and retests. Trade wisely, understanding that these are guides—not guarantees—of price action.</p><p>Bitcoin Price Outlook</p><p>My current analysis indicates a target range of $117,000 - $119,000 for Bitcoin futures.</p><p>Please note that the above video contains visual information only, as a technical issue is currently being addressed which impacts the audio.

2025-05-22T08:37:57.000Z,"Dubai regulator clarifies real-world asset tokenization rules: Lawyer","Newly updated guidelines from Dubai’s crypto regulator include provisions on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and clarify rules for issuers. On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) released its updated Rulebook for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) operating in the region. The regulator gave market participants until June 19 to comply with the new rules. The regulator previously told Cointelegraph that it had enhanced supervisory mechanisms and brought consistency across activity-based rules. One of the more prominent changes includes regulatory clarity on RWA tokens. Irina Heaver, partner at the United Arab Emirates-based law firm NeosLegal, told Cointelegraph that the updated rules clarify RWA issuance and distribution. “Issuing real-world asset tokens and listing them on secondary markets is no longer theoretical,” Heaver told Cointelegraph. “It’s now a regulatory reality in Dubai and the broader UAE.”A “viable” path to realize RWA hypeHeaver compared RWAs to security token offerings (STOs), an earlier attempt from the crypto space to tokenize securities like stocks, bonds and real estate investment trusts. However, the UAE crypto lawyer said that STOs “died a peaceful death in 2018 to 2019.” The lawyer told Cointelegraph STOs did not work out because of the lack of regulatory clarity, viable secondary market trading venues, institutional investor appetite and liquidity. Still, the situation is different for RWAs. Heaver told Cointelegraph that RWAs are the next foundational layer for institutional adoption of blockchain and virtual assets. Heaver said that VARA’s new rules already cover them as Asset-Referenced Virtual Assets (ARVA) tokens. She said: “VARA’s newly updated Virtual Asset Issuance Rulebook (May 2025) addresses these failures head-on. Regulated exchanges and broker-dealers in Dubai are now authorized to distribute and list ARVA tokens.”The lawyer said this solves an issue in jurisdictions like Switzerland, where token issuance is possible, but listing and secondary trading remain unregulated. Related: Dubai gov’t agencies to link real estate registry with property tokenizationLawyer shares requirements for RWA issuersHeaver said ARVA tokens are defined under Dubai law as representing direct or indirect ownership of real-world assets, granting entitlement to receive or share income and purporting to maintain a stable value by reference to real-world assets or income. ARVA tokens are also backed or collateralised by such real-world assets or constitute a derivative, wrapped, duplicated, or fractionalised version of another ARVA. The lawyer said issuers must meet specific requirements, including a Category 1 Virtual Asset Issuance license, a comprehensive white paper and a risk disclosure statement. In addition, issuers must have a paid-up capital of 1.5 million UAE dirhams (about $408,000) or 2% of reserve assets held. The issuers are also subjected to monthly independent audit obligations and must adhere to ongoing supervisory oversight. “VARA is providing regulatory clarity, and it’s giving the industry a viable, enforceable path to turn the hype of RWA tokenization into reality,” Heaver told Cointelegraph. “This matters because it marks a shift, from theory to execution, from fiction to framework.”Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/dubai-vara-guidelines-rwa-tokenization-clarity?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

At its core, shilling is the act of artificially promoting a cryptocurrency or token, often with exaggerated claims, to increase its price or popularity. But what’s the goal? Hype it up, get others to buy in, and then cash out, leaving latecomers holding the bag.Shilling can come from anyone: influencers, anonymous accounts or even high-profile figures with political or financial clout. The common thread is manipulation: It’s not about educating you or building real value but pumping hype for personal gain.Unfortunately, the line between enthusiastic promotion and outright deception can be thin, and many fall victim without realizing it. That’s why it’s critical to learn how to spot the signs early.                  5 red flags you’re being shilled              Beware of crypto red flags like overhyped promises, anonymous teams, influencer shills, missing products and FOMO tactics — if it smells like a scam, it probably is.1. Overhyped promises You’ve probably seen posts that scream:“100x potential!”“Guaranteed returns!”“This is your ticket to financial freedom!”These are classic shill tactics. Real, credible projects don’t promise life-changing profits. Why? Because there are no guarantees in crypto or in any investment.When a project leads with grandiose financial claims rather than actual product value or utility, it’s likely a ploy to stir FOMO and attract unsuspecting investors. The truth is, if something sounds too good to be true, it almost always is.Remember: The bigger the promise, the bigger the red flag.2. Anonymous or suspicious teams In crypto, anonymity isn’t always bad, but when you’re trusting people with your money, transparency matters.It’s a major red flag when a project has:No identifiable team membersFake names or aliasesStock photos on its websiteNo LinkedIn or professional history.The simple rule is “No face, no funds.”Scammers often hide behind anonymity because they know they’ll eventually vanish and there’ll be no one to hold accountable. Even worse, some use fabricated credentials or hire actors to pose as team members.Before investing, check whether the founders or developers have any verifiable history. Do they have prior experience in blockchain or startups? Have they launched anything successful before?3. Influencer spam and paid promotions One day, no one’s talking about a particular coin — the next, your feed is flooded with influencers hyping it up. Sound familiar?This sudden burst of attention is often coordinated with a paid promotion campaign disguised as “genuine enthusiasm.”Many influencers fail to disclose sponsorships, even though it’s required by law in many countries. The US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have cracked down on this in recent years.Take, for example:Kim Kardashian, who was fined $1.26 million in 2022 for promoting EthereumMax without proper disclosure.Floyd Mayweather Jr., who was sued for endorsing the same project at a paid event.BitBoy (Ben Armstrong), who faced legal action in multiple lawsuits for promoting scam tokens to his audience.If you notice multiple influencers promoting the same project in a short time, especially without using labels like #ad or #sponsored, it’s a strong indicator of a shill campaign.Don’t mistake volume for value. Hype doesn’t equal legitimacy.4. No real product or roadmapIf you visit the project’s website, it looks sleek, maybe even impressive. But where’s the product? Where’s the code?Shilled tokens often rely on flashy marketing but have no working application, no GitHub code and no actual use case. Everything is either “coming soon” or buried behind vague promises.Ask yourself:Can I use the platform or app today?Is there a white paper that makes sense?Do they have public repositories or open development?If all you’re seeing is a landing page and a vague roadmap that’s been “coming soon” for months, that’s a major red flag.5. Pressure tactics and FOMO Time pressure is a psychological weapon, and shillers know how to use it.Watch out for lines such as:“Presale ends in 2 hours!”“Only 1,000 spots left!”“If you don’t buy now, you’ll miss out forever!”These tactics prey on your fear of missing out (FOMO) and push you into making impulsive decisions without research.But crypto isn’t a sprint; it’s a long-term game. Anyone trying to rush you into buying likely has something to hide. Solid investments don’t need fake urgency.Take a breath, step back, and ask yourself: Am I buying because I believe in this project or because I’m being manipulated?Did you know? The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) secured a $128-million judgment against Ryan Mitchell Pope, Daniel Samuel Bishop and their company EmpiresX for operating a fraudulent forex and cryptocurrency investment scheme that defrauded over 12,500 victims.                  Is shilling illegal in crypto? Can influencers be sued?              Shilling isn’t just unethical in many cases — it’s also illegal.In the world of crypto, undisclosed promotions are a major legal risk. If someone is paid to promote a token or project but fails to reveal that financial connection, they could face fines, lawsuits or even criminal charges. This is especially true if the promoted token is later classified as a security under US law.Regulators like the SEC, FTC and CFTC have all cracked down on this behavior. Their targets have included:Influencers who failed to disclose paid promotionsPromoters who misled investors with false claimsIndividuals who ran pump-and-dump schemes using social media.Francier Obando Pinillo, a pastor from Miami, was indicted on 26 fraud counts for running a crypto scam through “Solano Fi,” defrauding investors of millions from 2021 to 2023. He allegedly used his church, social media and false promises of 34.9% monthly returns to lure victims. The platform showed fake gains but blocked withdrawals, while funds were diverted for personal use. Pinillo was arraigned in Richland, Washington and faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.As crypto becomes more mainstream, expect stricter regulations and more consequences for shillers.Did you know? Argentine President Javier Milei has dissolved the special task force investigating the LIBRA cryptocurrency scandal, a project he promoted in February 2025 that surged to a $4.5-billion valuation before crashing by over 97%. The task force, created by Milei himself, was disbanded via Decree 332/2025, citing that it had fulfilled its purpose. However, critics argue that no official findings were released, and judicial investigations into Milei and his associates continue.                  How to protect yourself from shilling scams              Do your own research, verify the team and utility, ignore hype and influencers, and stay alert to pump-and-dump schemes to avoid crypto shilling traps.Let’s understand how you can protect yourself from shilling scams in crypto:Do your own research (DYOR): Always research the project, the team behind it and the data supporting the claims. Don’t rely solely on hype or influencer recommendations. Look into onchain data, GitHub activity and the project’s utility to make informed decisions.Verify the team: A legitimate crypto project should have a transparent and credible team. If the developers are anonymous or have no professional profiles (like LinkedIn), that’s a red flag. Always check the team’s past projects and credibility before investing.Look for real utility: Does this project actually solve a problem? A genuine project should have a working product or solution, not just promises. Avoid projects that lack real-world utility or are still in “coming soon” stages for extended periods.Ignore the hype: If a token is suddenly trending on social media or being aggressively promoted, don’t let FOMO influence your judgment. Shillers often rely on emotions to push their agenda, so it’s essential to evaluate projects based on their merits, not just popularity.Stay skeptical of influencers: Influencers with large followings may be paid to promote certain tokens. Before taking their advice, ask yourself, What’s their incentive? Verify the promotion is legitimate and disclosed as paid or sponsored. Always cross-check the information with independent sources.Watch for pump-and-dump schemes: Be cautious of sudden price spikes followed by rapid drops. These are often signs of pump-and-dump schemes where the token’s value is artificially inflated by coordinated buying and then quickly sold off, leaving investors with losses. Always monitor price trends and be wary of sudden, unexplained increases in value.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/5-red-flags-youre-being-shilled-dont-buy-the-hype?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The steps include a new, trustless architecture, a native token, and the Seeker ship date.According to the announcement, Solana Mobile will ship the device starting Aug. 4. Seeker is the company’s second-generation device, after the Saga Web3 phone that launched in April 2023. The company unveiled the Seeker phone in September 2024, saying it wouldn’t just be a “memecoin phone.” So far, it has pre-sold 150,000 units.The Solana Seeker has gone through two sale phases: The Founder window, where the price for each device was $450, and the Early Adopter window, where the price per device was $500. Assuming the lower price window, Solana Mobile could generate at least $67.5 million in gross revenue from device sales. For comparison, the iPhone generated $199.3 billion in revenue for Apple in 2024.The new architecture that will govern future Solana Mobile devices is called TEEPIN, which stands for “Trusted Execution Environment Platform Infrastructure Network.” It is a three-layer architecture — hardware, platform, and network layers — that will allow users, developers, and device makers to participate in a trustless environment.Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder and CEO of Solana Labs, called TEEPIN “the next evolution in mobile” and a framework where trust is “verified by cryptography.”In addition, Solana Mobile is planning to launch “SKR,” the native asset of the Solana Mobile ecosystem. \""It transforms the traditional mobile business model by giving stakeholders actual ownership in the platform,” said Emmett Hollyer, general manager at Solana Mobile.

From a broad perspective, the $77 billion in Bitcoin futures open interest has undoubtedly played a role. However, a closer look at the data shows a more positive outlook for further price gains.Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.chThe current 7% annualized Bitcoin futures premium is well within the neutral range of 5% to 10%, which has been typical for the past two weeks. This indicator can easily exceed 30% during periods of strong optimism, so the current level is relatively low. At the same time, the absence of excessive leverage reduces concerns about a rally driven primarily by derivatives.Balanced order books and spot Bitcoin ETF inflows point to spot-driven rallyFor comparison, during the previous Bitcoin $109,346 all-time high on Jan. 20, the annualized futures premium reached 15%, showing a much higher level of leveraged bullish positions affecting the price. Therefore, the current Bitcoin derivatives market appears healthier, suggesting strong demand in spot markets.During the January bull run, Bitcoin’s price on Coinbase traded at a premium compared to other exchanges. This so-called Coinbase premium is not present now, which means buying pressure is more evenly spread out—a sign of a healthier market.Coinbase Bitcoin/USD relative to competitors. Source: TradingView / CointelegraphWhile excessive buying pressure on a single exchange is not necessarily bearish, it can make it easier to trigger unsustainable price surges when liquidity is low. This data supports the idea that derivatives markets were not the main driver of the recent price increases. Moreover, the $1.37 billion in net inflows to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States between May 15 and May 20 further suggests that spot buyers, rather than derivatives traders, were the primary force behind the rally.Despite the lack of conviction in Bitcoin futures, several indicators point to further upside. Forced liquidations of bearish BTC futures positions were relatively low at $170 million between May 18 and May 21, cementing the idea of a spot-driven rally. In comparison, the rally to $104,000 on May 9 triggered $538 million in liquidations over three days.Related: Is Bitcoin price close to a cycle top? — 5 indicators that help traders decideBitcoin options put-to-call ratio at Deribit.

Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin price predictionBitcoin rose above the $109,588 overhead resistance, but the bulls are struggling to sustain the higher levels, as seen from the long wick on the candlestick.BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) in the overbought zone indicate that the bulls are in control. If the price closes above $109,588, the BTC/USDT pair could pick up momentum and skyrocket toward $130,000.The 20-day exponential moving average ($101,958) is the critical support to watch out for on the downside. A break below the 20-day EMA will be the first sign that the bulls are booking profits in a hurry. That increases the risk of a break below the psychological support of $100,000. Ether price predictionBuyers are trying to sustain Ether (ETH) above the $2,550 level but are facing significant resistance from the bears.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping 20-day EMA ($2,334) and the RSI near the overbought zone indicate that buyers are in control. The ETH/USDT pair is likely to pick up momentum on a break above $2,739. That clears the path for a rally to $3,000.Contrary to this assumption, a break and close below the 20-day EMA signals that the bears are back in the game. The pair could tumble to $2,111, which is likely to attract solid buying by the bulls.XRP price predictionXRP (XRP) has been witnessing a tough battle between the buyers and sellers at the 20-day EMA ($2.35).XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. If the price skids below the 20-day EMA, the XRP/USDT pair may stay inside the $2 to $2.65 range for a while. Instead, if the price turns up sharply from the 20-day EMA and breaks above $2.65, the advantage will tilt in favor of the bulls. The pair could rally to $3 and, after that, to $3.40, where the sellers are expected to mount a strong defense.BNB price predictionBNB (BNB) bulls have held the 20-day EMA ($639) support during the pullback, indicating buying on dips. BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bulls will try to push the price above $693 but are expected to face solid selling by the bears. However, if buyers bulldoze their way through, the BNB/USDT pair could skyrocket to the overhead resistance at $745.This optimistic view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and breaks below the 20-day EMA. That could sink the pair to the 50-day SMA ($609). Solana price predictionSellers failed to pull Solana (SOL) below the 20-day EMA ($164), indicating demand at lower levels.SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bulls will try to propel the price above the $185 overhead resistance. If they can pull it off, the SOL/USDT pair could accelerate toward the target objective of $210 and then $220.If sellers want to prevent the upside, they will have to quickly tug the price below the 20-day EMA. The pair could slide to $153 and later to the 50-day SMA ($145). That suggests a possible range-bound action between $120 and $180.Dogecoin price predictionDogecoin (DOGE) has bounced off the breakout level of $0.21, indicating that buyers are active at lower levels.DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe 20-day EMA ($0.21) is trending up, and the RSI is in the positive zone, signaling that buyers are in command. The DOGE/USDT pair could rally to the $0.26 level, which could attract sellers. If the price turns down sharply from the overhead resistance, the pair could form a narrow range between $0.26 and $0.21 for some time.Contrarily, a break and close above $0.26 signals the start of the next leg of the up move. The pair could then surge to $0.35.Cardano price predictionThe bulls have kept Cardano (ADA) above the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders (H&S) pattern during the pullback. ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe flattish 20-day EMA ($0.74) and the RSI in the positive zone indicate the bulls have an edge. Buyers will have to thrust the price above $0.86 to signal the resumption of the uptrend. The ADA/USDT pair could then skyrocket to $1.01.This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the 50-day SMA ($0.69). That suggests the bulls are losing their grip, increasing the risk of a fall to $0.60.Related: Bitcoin enters ‘acceleration phase’ resembling BTC price gains seen after Trump election victorySui price predictionSui’s (SUI) pullback has taken support at the 20-day EMA ($3.73), indicating a positive sentiment.SUI/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory indicate an advantage to buyers. The SUI/USDT pair could reach the $4.25 obstacle, where the sellers are expected to step in. If buyers do not cede much ground to the bears, it increases the likelihood of a break above $4.25. The pair may then climb to $5.The 20-day EMA is the critical support to watch out for on the downside. A break and close below the 20-day EMA could sink the pair to the 50-day SMA ($3.04).Chainlink price predictionBuyers successfully defended the neckline of the inverse H&S pattern in Chainlink (LINK), indicating buying on dips.LINK/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bulls are trying to strengthen their position by pushing the price above the resistance line. If they manage to do that, the LINK/USDT pair could rally to $18. Sellers will try to halt the up move at $18, but the rally could extend to $19.80 if the bulls prevail.Time is running out for the bears. If they want to make a comeback, they will have to swiftly yank the price below the 50-day SMA. The pair may then remain inside the channel for a few more days.Avalanche price predictionAvalanche (AVAX) took support at the 50-day SMA ($20.88), signaling that the bulls are trying to form a higher low. AVAX/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewBuyers will have to drive and maintain the price above the $23.50 resistance to gain the upper hand. The AVAX/USDT pair could then climb to $26.84, which may act as a hurdle. If buyers overcome the $26.84 barrier, the pair could ascend to $31.73 and subsequently to $36.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance and breaks below the 50-day SMA, it suggests that the bulls have given up. The pair could then decline to $18.50.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-21T17:55:00.000Z,"Interest groups, lawmakers to protest Trump&#039;s memecoin dinner","Democratic leaning organizations and members of Congress have announced plans to protest what they describe as the sale of access to the office of the US president, in reference to Donald Trump’s memecoin dinner on May 22. The event’s attendees are said to have collectively spent over $100 million for the chance to meet with the US president.Since Trump’s memecoin project, Official Trump (TRUMP), announced that its top 220 tokenholders would have an opportunity to apply for an exclusive dinner with the president, many leaders in the crypto industry and US lawmakers have criticized the event, saying Trump was opening his office to potential bribery and corruption. The memecoin dinner prompted some Democratic lawmakers to withdraw support for crypto-related legislation in Congress, including the market structure and stablecoin bills.“Trump collecting gifts from foreign governments is unconstitutional,” a spokesperson for the consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen, which is planning to protest near the memecoin dinner on May 22, told Cointelegraph. “Collecting foreign government investments through his memecoin is not much better. American foreign policy should not be for sale.”Source: Public CitizenCrypto industry figures such as Tron founder Justin Sun, Kronos Research chief investment officer Vincent Liu, Hyperithm co-CEO Oh Sangrok, and Synthetix founder Kain Warwick are among the tokenholders expected to attend the dinner at the Trump National Golf Club outside Washington, DC. The memecoin project said all applicants had to pass a background check and could not be from a “[Know Your Customer] watchlist country.”Related: Democrats seek suspicious activity reports linked to Trump crypto venturesPublic Citizen, in partnership with progressive political organization Our Revolution, will hold a rally near the golf club, which Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley is expected to attend. In addition, the Arlington and Loudoun Democrats will be hosting a separate event to urge US officials to “hold [Trump] accountable,” and Democratic leadership in Congress has scheduled two press events on May 22 ahead of the dinner.“Americans cannot and will not accept President Trump’s view that positions of power exist only to benefit the holder of that power,” Ryan Ruzic, chair of the Loudoun County Democratic Committee, told Cointelegraph. “We have a moral responsibility to speak out against corruption, whatever the result may be.”Pushback on TRUMP memecoin affected crypto legislationSome lawmakers initially cited the memecoin dinner and the Trump family’s involvement with the crypto platform World Liberty Financial in opposing passage of the GENIUS Act, a bill to regulate payment stablecoins. World Liberty Financial began issuing its own USD1 stablecoin in March, prompting concerns about Trump’s conflicts of interest. However, the legislation passed a key procedural vote in the Senate on May 19 with support from Democrats, setting the bill up for debate in the chamber.“Many senators, myself included, have very real concerns about the Trump family’s use of crypto technologies to evade oversight, hide shady financial dealings, and personally profit at the expense of everyday Americans,” said Sen. Mark Warner in a statement before the May 19 vote, adding: “But we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay.”Senator Chris Murphy, who voted against advancing the GENIUS Act, called for bipartisan support in amending the bill to specifically bar a US president from issuing stablecoins. He also called on the White House to release a complete list of attendees to the memecoin dinner, suggesting that some or all of them would “try to get something from the president” in exchange for purchasing the tokens. Murphy and Senator Elizabeth Warren will attend a press event with representatives for Public Citizen on May 22. California Representative Maxine Waters, ranking member of the US House Financial Services Committee, announced a separate press conference for the same day, with plans to introduce a bill to “block Trump’s memecoin and stop his crypto corruption, once and for all.”As of May 21, the exact number of attendees to the dinner was unknown. A smaller group of 25 tokenholders also qualified to apply for “VIP tour” and reception — presumably at the White House — with Trump, but the complete list of those planning to attend was also unknown at the time of publication.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/protest-donald-trump-memecoin-dinner?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-21T17:02:48.000Z,"Is Bitcoin price close to a cycle top? — 5 indicators that help traders decide","Key takeaways:Bitcoin market cycle tops are notoriously hard to time, but combining technical and behavioral indicators can offer strong signals.The MVRV-Z Score, Pi Cycle Top indicator, trade volume trends, Puell Multiple, and exchange inflows accurately predict Bitcoin price cycle tops.Bitcoin (BTC) might be approaching the final stage of its current market cycle — a dramatic final rally followed by a sharp correction and, eventually, a bear market. For many, this could be the long-awaited climax of the past four years, and major players are preparing accordingly.Since late 2024, Bitcoin whale accumulation has surged. Glassnode data shows that the number of addresses holding over 100 BTC has jumped by almost 14%, reaching 18,200 — a level not seen since 2017. The biggest market players appear to be positioning for what could be this cycle’s final run-up.Number of BTC addresses holding over 100 BTC. Source: GlassnodeHowever, riding the rally is trickier than it looks and knowing when to exit is notoriously difficult. The lure of higher price highs fuels FOMO, driving investors to buy the top, only to face painful drawdowns or even liquidations.So, how can traders and investors spot the top before the market enters recession?Bitcoin cycle top markersSeveral technical and onchain indicators, such as MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Z-score, Pi Cycle Top, and trading volume trends, have historically been reliable in signaling when Bitcoin is nearing its peak.The MVRV-Z score compares Bitcoin’s market value to its realized value and adjusts for volatility. A high Z-score suggests Bitcoin is significantly overvalued relative to its historical cost basis. When this indicator is at a historical high, the ensuing downward trend in Bitcoin prices is likely.The Pi Cycle Top tracks BTC price dynamics using moving averages. When the 111-day moving average (111-SMA) crosses above twice the 350-day average (350-SMAx2), it signals overheating. In other words, when the short-term trend catches up to the long-term trajectory, a market top is in.Historically, all previous Bitcoin bull runs started with a notable surge in MVRV Z-score, and ended with 111-SMA crossing the longer-term trend.BTC: Pi Cycle Top + MVRV Z-score. Source: Marie Poteriaieva, GlassnodeAdditionally, lower trading volumes during price increases can be a warning sign, often signaling weakening momentum and potential for a reversal. On-balance volume (OBV), which registers cumulative volume flow, is a valuable metric for tracking this process. When OBV diverges from the price action, it is often an early reversal signal. The second leg of the 2021 bull run was a great example. While BTC price was hitting higher highs of $68,000 (compared to the previous all-time high of $63,170), trading volumes moved in a different direction, decreasing from 710,000 BTC to 628,000 BTC. This created a bearish divergence between price and volume, suggesting that fewer market participants were supporting the rally — a classic sign of waning momentum.BTC/USD 1-day, OBV. Source: Marie Poteriaieva, TradingViewProfit-taking metricsAs market cycle tops approach, long-term holders and Bitcoin miners often start locking in profits. Some valuable metrics that can track it are the Puell Multiple and exchange flows.The Puell Multiple Indicator looks at miners' revenue relative to its 365-day average. High readings indicate miners may start selling aggressively, and are often seen near market tops.Large inflows to exchanges are usually signs of distribution, as investors prepare to sell their coins. BTC total transfer volume to exchanges + Puell Multiple.

Bitcoin moves vertically for weeks, with massive $10,000+ daily candles.Whiplash. Bitcoin experiences its sharpest correction of the bull cycle. The curved parabolic trendline that’s supported the rally is broken — a clear signal that the top is likely in. Meanwhile, altcoins and meme tokens may continue pumping a little longer.Complacency. Measure 15% below Bitcoin’s all-time high. That’s the sell zone. Order books on major exchanges often show a wall of sell orders around this level — a likely institutional exit point.According to Garner, the 15% (or 16%) rule works not only in crypto but in traditional markets as well.Historical blow off-tops: BTC, ETH, gold, Nasdaq, Nikkei, Broadvision, 3D Systems.

In a May 21 social media post that begins with, “The Empire Lobbies Back,” Campbell claimed that the banking industry is especially alarmed by the potential for stablecoins to offer interest or rewards to holders. In a pointed message aimed at Democratic lawmakers, Campbell wrote that “banks want you to protect their cartel so they can keep screwing your voters.” He went on to explain how fractional reserve banking enables banks to maximize profits while offering depositors minimal interest.The banking lobby says that if stablecoins pay interest or any other type of monetary reward, banks will be “harmed,” Campbell added.An excerpt of Campbell’s X post. Source: Austin Campbell“This is naked pandering for cartel protection,” he said while urging the opposition party to avoid “screwing” its voters with supporting any type of blanket ban on stablecoin interest payments.Campbell has long advocated for sensible stablecoin legislation in the United States, warning a Congressional subcommittee in April 2023 that failing to enact such laws would push issuers overseas.Related: Pareto launches synthetic dollar backed by private creditThe rise of yield-bearing stablecoinsCampbell’s scathing assessment of the traditional banking industry comes amid a wave of stablecoin issuers launching yield-bearing tokens. As reported by Cointelegraph, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in February approved the first yield-bearing stablecoin security by Figure Markets.

In line with its current trajectory, 21st Capital co-founder Sina noted that Bitcoin is approaching a pivotal moment around the $108,000 level. The Bitcoin Quantile Model update shows that BTC’s market reflects the same “heat” that was present after President Trump’s post-election rally and the spot ETF-driven highs during Q4 2024. The model, which uses quantile regression to map Bitcoin’s price phases on a logarithmic scale, indicates the cryptocurrency is in the Transition Zone, a critical juncture before the Acceleration Phase. Throughout Q4, 2024, Bitcoin rallied by 45% after entering a price discovery period above $74,500. Bitcoin Quantile Model. Source: X.comAs illustrated in the chart, once it breaks into the \""Acceleration\"" Phase, it could trigger BTC’s next leg or the mid-phase, typically between the 33% and 66% range. Based on the model, BTC is expected to progressively target price levels of $130,000 and $163,000 in the coming months. However, anonymous Bitcoin analyst apsk32 believed a price target above $200,000 is a “reasonable” expectation for 2025. Basing the projection on Bitcoin’s “power curve,” the analyst noted that BTC’s position relative to gold has significantly improved since April. From a technical standpoint, this view is supported by the recent convergence of the Sharpe ratios for Bitcoin and gold, suggesting that the two hard assets now offer comparable risk-to-reward profiles to their investors. Fidelity’s Director of Global Macro Jurrien Timmer shed light on this development, recommending a 4:1 goal-to-Bitcoin ratio from an allocation perspective. Related: Bitcoin 'blow-off top' set at $128K with new all-time highs in sightStrong Bitcoin volumes “final straw” before new highs Crypto researcher Aylo analyzed BTC’s historical price action when the crypto asset consolidates near its all-time high level. In an X post, the analyst explained, “The data shows when BTC gets close to its previous ATH during a strong, accelerating trend with high momentum, it has historically broken out to new ATHs within a short time (days to weeks).”However, weaker trends have led to stalls or retraces between March and May 2024. Currently, Bitcoin exhibits a strong trend but lacks the necessary trading volume, which remains the final straw to confirm a breakout, a factor that could delay upward movement.Alyo added that for Bitcoin to break its all-time highs, daily trading volume should exceed the previous 10 days, be at least 1.5 times the 20-day average, and ideally sustain a 3-day increase while the price holds steady or rises.Data from CryptoQuant has reinforced Aylo’s concerns about trading volume.

2025-05-21T15:00:00.000Z,"How to handle crypto trading gains and losses on your balance sheet","Key takeawaysProperly accounting for crypto assets on your balance sheet is essential for accurate tax reporting and financial transparency.Crypto trading activities should be recorded like stock trading, at fair market value on the day of purchase.In some countries, like the US, crypto losses can offset gains, so keeping track of gains and losses is important for reducing taxable income.Whether you’re an individual investor or a business, treating cryptocurrencies as assets and documenting them ensures compliance with tax laws and minimizes the risk of errors.Let’s be real, it’s easy to lose sight of what you’ve actually gained or lost, especially when it comes to crypto and its market volatility and frequent trading activities. And when it comes to accounting, especially in countries like the United States, it gets trickier because you must reflect those numbers properly on your balance sheet. If you are running a business that involves crypto or you are just a crypto investor, understanding how to account for your digital assets correctly is crucial. This guide breaks down the basics of balance sheets, handling crypto gains and losses, and what tax implications you need to account for.What is a balance sheet, and why is it needed?Think of a balance sheet as a report of your financial health. It shows what you own, owe and what’s left over at a specific point in time. It contains three main parts: Assets: What the company owns, such as cash, crypto, real estate, inventory, etc.Liabilities: What the company owes, such as loans, unpaid bills and taxesEquity: What’s left after subtracting liabilities from assets (net worth).For example, if you own $50,000 worth of crypto, and at the same time, you owe someone $20,000. In this case, your equity is $30,000. Balance sheets help you understand your financial position at a glance. They’re essential for filing taxes, attracting investors, applying for loans and complying with regulations. Balance sheets are essential in countries like the United States, where businesses must report crypto holdings accurately for tax and compliance reasons. Similarly, in the UK, European countries and Canada, balance sheets are important for businesses and are often used by individuals, especially when dealing with crypto assets. It’s not just for taxes. A well-maintained balance sheet can help you get funding, plan your finances, or simply sleep better knowing where you stand at night.How do you treat crypto on a balance sheet?One of the most common questions when preparing a balance sheet is, “How to report crypto trading gains and losses on a balance sheet?” In most jurisdictions, the crypto reporting and taxation rules are still to be decided or clarified. This also applies to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which lack definitive guidance concerning cryptocurrency accounting.As cryptocurrencies are considered assets in many jurisdictions, the fundamental concepts of accounting for assets could apply when preparing a balance sheet involving crypto transactions. Below is an example of a simplified crypto balance sheet treatment and some helpful pointers that may assist you in accounting for crypto trading in 2025.Notes to the balance sheet:Cash ($15,000): Represents fiat currency (e.g., USD) held in bank accounts or wallets, including proceeds from selling crypto or other revenue.Cryptocurrency ($20,000): Recorded at cost basis (fair market value at acquisition, less any impairment). Includes 0.5 Bitcoin (BTC) purchased at $30,000 each ($15,000 total) and 10 Ether (ETH) purchased at $500 each ($5,000 total). No impairment has been recorded, assuming the fair market value (FMV) remains above cost.Mining equipment ($5,000): Capitalized cost of crypto mining hardware, net of depreciation. The original cost was $8,000, with $3,000 accumulated depreciation over two years.Accounts payable ($2,000): Unpaid bills (e.g., for electricity or supplier services related to crypto mining operations).Taxes payable ($1,500): Estimated tax liability for realized crypto gains (e.g., from selling 0.1 BTC at a $2,000 gain, taxed at 20% long-term capital gains rate for simplicity).Retained earnings ($36,500): Accumulated profits, including crypto-related income (e.g., mining revenue, realized gains) minus expenses and taxes. Reflects net income from prior and current periods.When buying cryptocurrency with fiat moneyWhen you buy cryptocurrency with fiat money, such as dollars or euros, you’re simply exchanging one type of asset, such as cash, for another, like crypto or stocks. On your balance sheet, cryptocurrency trading activities should be recorded similarly to those of stock trading activities. As with stocks, you should record cryptocurrency on your balance sheet at its fair market value on the day of purchase. While your cash account displays a credit for the same amount, the cryptocurrency is recorded as a debit to your assets account.When selling cryptocurrency for fiat moneySelling crypto for fiat creates a change in your balance sheet: Your crypto holdings will be reduced, meaning credited, and your cash will increase, which also means that the account will be credited.If you sell for more than you paid (the original price of a token), you have a gain; if you sell for less, you record a loss. Both crypto gains and crypto losses should be tracked carefully for tax and reporting purposes.How to record crypto lossesThe difference is recorded as a loss when you sell crypto at a lower price than you bought it for. In some countries, these losses can lower your taxable income, so it can prove useful to properly document them.  However, even if the asset regains its previous price levels, impairment losses cannot be undone in accordance with GAAP’s accounting rules for intangible assets.This contrasts with IFRS, where certain intangible assets can be revalued upward under IAS 38 if an active market exists. However, crypto markets are volatile, and IFRS guidance on crypto revaluation remains unclear, so most entities stick to cost-less impairment. Businesses should consult local accounting standards and auditors for precise treatment.How to record crypto profitsIf you receive cryptocurrency as payment for goods, services or other activities, it’s treated as income at the fair market value on the date you receive it. This value is recorded as revenue and added to your assets. Later, if you sell or swap the crypto, any difference in value will result in a capital gain or loss.How to record crypto mining When cryptocurrency mining income occurs, it should be reported at the currency’s fair market value. This revenue should be shown on your income statement since it increases your assets.Similar to other revenue-generating activities, companies engaged in cryptocurrency mining are required to report their crypto profits on their balance sheet. Their mining income account will be credited as a result. Subsequently, the newly generated digital asset has to be recorded in their accounts at its fair market value.Additionally, costs related to mining operations should be recorded. For example, the cash account needs to be credited if cash is spent to cover mining costs. The purchase of mining equipment, which requires capitalization and amortization, will subsequently be deducted from the associated asset account or otherwise documented as a cost for items like utilities and supplies.Using cryptocurrency to pay suppliersPaying suppliers or vendors with cryptocurrency is like selling the asset since you have to recognize any gain or loss in relation to its original value. Therefore, the difference between the asset’s book value and its expense will be recorded as a capital gain.How to record transaction fees and exchange rates It’s critical to keep track of transaction costs and exchange rate fluctuations when trading or exchanging cryptocurrencies. Fees should be shown as an expense on the balance sheet since they lower your net gain or increase your loss. Changes in exchange rates may also have an impact on the value recorded when converting cryptocurrency into fiat, which could have an effect on your taxes and capital gains.Did you know? Cryptocurrency held for more than a year can be categorized as a long-term asset on your balance sheet in some jurisdictions, which may result in better tax treatment than short-term holdings.How are cryptocurrencies taxed?Taxation of cryptocurrencies varies by country, but your balance sheet plays a crucial role in tracking taxable events. Under current GAAP, crypto is recorded at cost and tested for impairment. IFRS allows revaluation in rare cases, but most entities use the cost model. For traders holding crypto as inventory, GAAP (ASC 330) or IFRS (IAS 2) may apply, with FMV adjustments. The lack of definitive guidance means businesses must apply judgment and document assumptions clearly. In the US, crypto is treated as property, with taxes applied to capital gains when selling or trading. The Internal Revenue Service requires reporting on your balance sheet; losses can offset gains. Also, the US introduced Form 1099-DA in 2025 for crypto brokers to report transactions, increasing compliance requirements. In the UK, cryptocurrencies are taxed under capital gains for individuals, while income tax may apply if trading is frequent or when crypto is received as income, such as through mining, staking or as payment for services.Canada follows a similar approach, taxing crypto as capital gains (50% inclusion rate) or business income for active traders. Mining income is taxable as income.In Germany, long-term holders (over a year) pay no tax on capital gains, but short-term trades over 600 euros are taxed. Notably, the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation (effective 2024) standardizes crypto reporting, impacting balance sheet documentation in member states.Accounting for Ethereum transactionsEthereum, the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts, has unique accounting needs. Here’s how to handle common Ethereum transactions on your balance sheet:Staking rewards: Staking ETH on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network generates rewards, treated as income at FMV when received. For example, receiving 0.1 ETH as a staking reward debits your “Cryptocurrency” asset account and credits “Revenue” on your income statement. Selling staked ETH later triggers a capital gain or loss.Gas fees: Ethereum transactions incur gas fees, which are expenses. Record these as a debit to “Transaction Fees” (an expense account) and a credit to “Cash” or “Cryptocurrency” if paid in ETH. For example, a $50 gas fee paid in ETH reduces your ETH holdings and is expensed.DeFi transactions: Yield farming or liquidity provision (e.g., on Uniswap) generates rewards, treated as income at FMV when received. For example, earning 100 UNI (UNI) tokens ($1,000) debits “Cryptocurrency” and credits “Revenue.” Track gas fees and token swaps as expenses or taxable events.ERC-20 tokens: Ethereum-based tokens (e.g., USDC, LINK) are separate assets. Record each at its FMV at acquisition, like ETH, and track them individually to avoid confusion.Accurate tracking of Ethereum transactions ensures compliance, especially with increased IRS scrutiny on staking and DeFi in 2025.Tools and best practices for crypto accountingManaging crypto transactions can be daunting, but these tools and tips simplify the process:Accounting software: Use platforms like CoinTracker, Koinly or CryptoTaxCalculator to track Ethereum transactions, calculate gains/losses, and generate tax reports. These tools integrate with wallets and exchanges, ensuring accurate FMV records.Regular reconciliation: Match your balance sheet’s crypto holdings to wallet/exchange records monthly to catch errors, especially for gas fees or staking rewards.Work with professionals: Crypto tax rules, especially for Ethereum’s DeFi and staking, are complex. Consult a crypto-savvy accountant to ensure compliance with IRS, His Majesty’s Revenue & Customs or other regulations.Document everything: Keep records of every Ethereum transaction, including FMV, gas fees and staking rewards, to prepare for audits or Form 1099-DA reporting in 2025.By staying organized, you’ll minimize errors and stress when filing taxes or preparing financial statements.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-trading-gains-and-losses-on-balance-sheet?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-21T15:00:00.000Z,"Crypto&#039;s real momentum isn&#039;t in the charts; it&#039;s in developer activity","Opinion by: Markus Levin, co-founder of XYOThe crypto community often experiences periods of heightened anxiety. Market downturns are often triggered by counterproductive sentiment-driven events rather than by fundamental issues, creating a significant disconnect between price behavior and the actual progress being made within the industry by the companies within it. What often goes unnoticed is how much real development happens during these downturns. While market movements capture most of the attention, teams are building faster and more deliberately behind the scenes than ever. The focus shifts away from price speculation and toward real execution. Growth happens during downturns. It's a necessary phase for projects that thrive in a volatile industry. They re-focus attention on refining their technology and business, fueling the next wave of progress.As a result, there's a disconnect between online sentiment and conversations between blockchain industry leaders. For builders and project leaders, the atmosphere is of determination, not doom.Regulators are coming on boardOne of the most promising developments is the accelerating momentum of regulation policy. Many European companies are applying for MiCA licenses in preparation for regulatory updates. There's also a significant policy shift under new US leadership as the SEC retreats from several high-profile crypto enforcement actions. The disparity between sentiment and reality serves as a reminder that price is a lagging indicator. Selloffs are triggered by uncertainty around tariff announcements and background activity such as interest rates. Material, long-term statistics speak for the virtually universal optimism among industry leaders as the number of active developers has remained stable, and the number of established developers almost doubled last year. That's an incredible jump in only one year. From hype to substanceMaturation means teams thoughtfully building, governments engaging seriously with legislation, and users demanding better UX and real utility. The industry has a well-established pattern — market corrections wipe away hype and encourage focus. The last bear market gave rise to breakthroughs in DeFi, NFTs, and zero-knowledge tech. This time, it's about real-world infrastructure, regulation-ready platforms, and next-gen scalability.What emerges in these periods tends to be less visible but more durable. Teams that remain active are often those with clear models, sufficient runway, and a willingness to adapt. These are the periods when we learn whether the systems being built can handle real-world demands. One of the most promising frontiers lies at the intersection of AI and blockchain, the most ubiquitous being within Large Language Models. AI is, however, only as good as the data it's trained on.AI systems are evolving rapidly, but their foundations are skewed. They're built primarily on data scraped from the digital-first countries that predominantly lie in the northern hemisphere, which dominates global media production and internet usage. This creates a feedback loop where Western and East Asian perspectives and widely spoken languages such as English and Mandarin are not only amplified but leave little room for necessary data from smaller populations.A report from Web3 Technologies said 60% of tier-one media on the internet is English. Prominent among these media outlets is The New York Times, which has sued OpenAI based on copyright infringement. The publication alleges that their copyright-protected data was used to train OpenAI's LLM model. Recent: The future of finance is built on Bitcoin — Ethereum was just the testnetKnowing the full extent of the global imbalance in the data creating AI outputs is impossible. Allegations like this and the results delivered when using AI tools suggest the pressing need for a solution.It's even worse. When AI systems are trained on narrow, incomplete data sets, the results can exclude billions from the benefits of emerging technologies. As IBM highlights, data bias isn't just a technical issue — it's a human one with real-world consequences in healthcare, finance, agriculture, and beyond.It's become normal to use AI data every day. We receive personalized Google search results, Adobe has built AI into its industry-standard graphic and video software, and we use AI assistants like Gemini, Grok, and ChatGPT to formulate the thoughts with which we represent ourselves. All of these tools are affected by an overwhelming bias toward the center of a bell curve within their data sets, unable to access or address less common use cases.A popular example demonstrates this issue: Until recently, image generators could not create a full wine glass. No matter what prompt you provided, a wine glass full to the edge was beyond the capabilities of all known generative AI software because they had never been provided photos of wine glasses full to the brim. Their data sets had to be updated to correct this comical problem, which revealed a much more serious one.Decentralized data offers a solution. Globally incentivized systems like DePINs enable the participation of populations that would otherwise remain underserved, allowing the valuable data they provide to come online. This improves the service for everyone, making smaller global communities more accessible to commerce and enabling them easier access to the rest of the world. It also empowers smaller data creators to monetize their data rather than relinquishing it to tech giants. Where do we go from here?The crypto industry is entering a new phase. A phase that's more productive and sustainable. Expect to see rapid growth in working infrastructure, platforms and applications that welcome knowledgeable, consumer-friendly regulations and projects that respect the time and money of their users.Opportunities within the crypto space are changing but not shrinking. Our opportunities grow as we learn from what has not worked in the last few years. They will take time to develop, but successful builders will focus on long-term, incremental change and sound business practices rather than chasing fads and short-term profits.The momentum of real progress has never been stronger, and it is precisely during times like these, when it feels like no one's watching, that the foundations of the future are laid.Opinion by: Markus Levin, co-founder of XYO.

Source: Trugard and WebacyCrypto address poisoning is a scam where attackers send small amounts of cryptocurrency from a wallet address that closely resembles a target’s real address, often with the same starting and ending characters. The goal is to trick the user into accidentally copying and reusing the attacker’s address in future transactions, resulting in lost funds.The technique exploits how users often rely on partial address matching or clipboard history when sending crypto. A January 2025 study found that over 270 million poisoning attempts occurred on BNB Chain and Ethereum between July 1, 2022, and June 30, 2024. Of those, 6,000 attempts were successful, leading to losses over $83 million.Related: What are address poisoning attacks in crypto and how to avoid them?Web2 security in a Web3 worldTrugard chief technology officer Jeremiah O’Connor told Cointelegraph that the team brings deep cybersecurity expertise from the Web2 world, which they’ve been “applying to Web3 data since the early days of crypto.” The team is applying its experience with algorithmic feature engineering from traditional systems to Web3. He added:“Most existing Web3 attack detection systems rely on static rules or basic transaction filtering. These methods often fall behind evolving attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures.“The newly developed system instead leverages machine learning to create a system that learns and adapts to address poisoning attacks. O’Connor highlighted that what sets their system apart is “its emphasis on context and pattern recognition.” Isogawa explained that “AI can detect patterns often beyond the reach of human analysis.”Related: Jameson Lopp sounds alarm on Bitcoin address poisoning attacksThe machine learning approachO’Connor said Trugard generated synthetic training data for the AI to simulate various attack patterns. Then the model was trained through supervised learning, a type of machine learning where a model is trained on labeled data, including input variables and the correct output.In such a setup, the goal is for the model to learn the relationship between inputs and outputs to predict the correct output for new, unseen inputs. Common examples include spam detection, image classification and price prediction.O’Connor said the model is also updated by training it on new data as new strategies emerge. “To top it off, we’ve built a synthetic data generation layer that lets us continuously test the model against simulated poisoning scenarios,” he said. “This has proven incredibly effective in helping the model generalize and stay robust over time.“Magazine: Crypto-Sec: Phishing scammer goes after Hedera users, address poisoner gets $70K",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-system-has-97-claimed-efficacy-in-preventing-address-poisoning-attacks?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

In a May 21 post on X, Legislative Council member Johnny Ng Kit-Chong said the bill had passed its third reading, clearing the final hurdle for adoption.“It is expected that by the end of this year, major institutions will be able to apply to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to become licensed stablecoin issuers,” Ng said.Image of the legislative assembly session. Source: Johnny Ng Kit-ChongAccording to the new Hong Kong legislation, stablecoins must be backed by fiat currency as underlying assets. Ng said Hong Kong is welcoming “global enterprises and institutions interested in issuing stablecoins to apply in Hong Kong,” offering to personally assist with introductions and collaboration:“I am also happy to facilitate connections and collaborate with all stakeholders to advance the development of Web3 in Asia and globally, with Hong Kong at the center.“Related: Hong Kong introduces crypto staking rules, reaffirms Web3 commitmentHong Kong aims to become a Web3 powerhouseNg said the legislation marks the first step on the road toward building Web3 infrastructure in Hong Kong. “The most crucial step is to develop more real-world applications.”Ng said stablecoin adoption has the potential to drive innovation in retail payments, cross-border trade and peer-to-peer transactions.  He added that he encourages the development and adoption of stablecoins, since “they represent a major financial innovation.” Regarding enhancing market stability, Ng suggested distributing interest earnings to stablecoin holders.Related: HashKey receives Hong Kong approval to offer crypto staking servicesInterest for stablecoin holdersAccording to Ng, “providing interest will strengthen the competitiveness of stablecoins.” This increased competitiveness, he explained, incentivizes broader participation and expands stablecoin market share, which supports what he views as sustainable growth.Ng’s remarks that yield-bearing stablecoins are more competitive follow recent positive data. Research indicates that yield-bearing stablecoins have soared to $11 billion in circulation, representing 4.5% of the total stablecoin market, a steep climb from just $1.5 billion and a 1% market share at the start of 2024.Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/hong-kong-passes-stablecoin-bill-opens-licensing-by-year-end?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-21T11:19:25.000Z,"Yield-bearing stablecoins surge to $11B, now 4.5% of market: Report","Yield-bearing stablecoins have soared to $11 billion in circulation, representing 4.5% of the total stablecoin market — a steep climb from just $1.5 billion and a 1% market share at the start of 2024.One of the biggest winners of this trend is Pendle, a decentralized protocol that enables users to lock in fixed yields or speculate on variable interest rates. Pendle now accounts for 30% of all yield-bearing stablecoin total value locked (TVL), roughly $3 billion, the firm said in a report shared with Cointelegraph.  Pendle noted that stablecoins make up 83% of its $4 billion total value locked, a sharp rise from less than 20% just a year ago. In contrast, assets such as Ether (ETH), which historically contributed 80–90% of Pendle’s TVL, have shrunk to less than 10% of its TVL.Traditional stablecoins like USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC) do not pass on interest to holders. With over $200 billion in circulation and US Federal Reserve interest rates at 4.3%, Pendle estimated that stablecoin holders are missing out on over $9 billion in annual yield.Pendle TVL share by assets.

The approval allows yield-bearing stablecoins to operate under specific rules, including registration, disclosure requirements and investor protections.  Moreover, proposed bills like the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) and the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) further signal a favorable direction.Meanwhile, Pendle said it expects stablecoin issuance to double to $500 billion in the next 18 to 24 months. The firm also anticipates yield-bearing stablecoins to capture 15% of this market with $75 billion in issuance (7x growth from $11 billion).Yield-bearing stablecoins issuance.

However, newer entrants such as Open Eden, Reserve and Falcon have increased the share of non-USDe assets from 1% to 26% over the past year.Pendle is also expanding beyond Ethereum, with plans to support networks like Solana and to integrate with Aave and Ethena’s upcoming Converge blockchain.Notably, interest in yield-generating strategies within the cryptocurrency sector has surged in recent years, driven by both retail and institutional investors seeking to maximize returns on their digital assets.On May 19, Franklin, a hybrid cash and crypto payroll provider, announced the launch of Payroll Treasury Yield, which uses blockchain lending protocols to help firms earn returns on payroll funds.Magazine: NBA star Tristan Thompson misses $32B in Bitcoin by taking $82M contract in cash",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/yield-bearing-stablecoins-hit-11b-pendle-dominates-growth?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
