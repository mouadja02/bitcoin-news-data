After briefly dropping to $160 from $184, Solana (SOL) is attempting to reclaim a position above its key resistance at $180 for a second consecutive week. With Bitcoin (BTC) hitting an all-time high, market speculators are banking on eventual capital rotation, which could pump major altcoins like SOL toward new highs. Solana shows promising signs on the daily chart, forming a textbook bull flag pattern after a strong uptrend. While SOL prices currently trade under $180, a breakout above this level could propel SOL toward its first target at $200, with further upside potential to $220 if momentum sustains. Solana 1-day chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The trend remains bullish, supported by the relative strength index (RSI) at 64.30, indicating healthy momentum without overbought conditions. However, SOL needs a clear market structure break (MSB) or a decisive bullish breakout above $180 to trigger the next leg of the rally. Declining volumes during the consolidation phase suggest caution, as a lack of buying pressure could stall the breakout. If SOL fails to breach $180, the immediate key area of interest is between $140-150, and the bull flag pattern would be invalidated. The support range is a daily order block, which should provide higher time frame (HTF) support in case of a price correction.

Mercer emphasized two critical zones: one around late 2024, where SOL broke past $180 after consolidation, and a current zone mirroring that setup. He predicts a breakout above $180 could trigger a sharp upward rally, mirroring the late 2024 rally that saw $SOL peak near $260. Solana price fractal analysis.

2025-05-22T18:30:49.000Z,"XRP Price To See 64,000% Rally To $1,700? Analysts Reveal End Of Year Predictions","XRP price forecasts have taken a dramatic turn as bold predictions surface, suggesting that the cryptocurrency could be on the verge of a parabolic 64,000% rally to $1,700. Analysts backing this ambitious forecast point to historical price patterns and XRP’s current technical structure as the basis for their end-of-the-year predictions. A chart shared by crypto analyst The Real Remi Relief on X (formerly Twitter) shows that XRP is mirroring a technical pattern that preceded its 2017-2018 historical bull run — one that saw the third largest cryptocurrency skyrocket by tens of thousands of percent in just a few months. Now that this historical pattern is unfolding, the analyst has confirmed that a breakout is on the horizon for XRP, with projections pointing toward a potential price target as high as $1,700. XRP Price End Of Year Forecast The chart shows two distinct consolidation phases in XRP’s price action — the first spanning from 2014 to 2017 and the second lasting from 2018 until early 2024. During both periods, the cryptocurrency underwent a long-term compression under a descending resistance line. This compression was followed by a breakout, retest, and vertical price expansion. Related Reading: XRP Moves Into Key Range Against Bitcoin As 3 Major Targets Show Up Notably, this breakout in 2017 led to XRP reaching its historical all-time high of $3.84 — a level it hasn’t revisited for over six years. Earlier this year, XRP experienced a similar breakout that pushed it above the multi-year downtrend. The current chart shows that the cryptocurrency’s retest is holding steady, and this pattern has previously preceded massive rallies during the past bull cycles. As a result, Real Remi Relief argues that history is on the verge of repeating itself. According to his end-of-year forecast for XRP, the cryptocurrency is poised for a staggering 64,000% rally, placing its price at a jaw-dropping $1,700 per token by as early as Q4 2025 or Q1 2026. While the timeline could extend into the following year, the outlook still frames 2025 as a bullish turning point for XRP, with strong potential for the altcoin to close the year in a strong green. Interestingly, the crypto expert has also shared a more conservative target, predicting that XRP could record a still ambitious, but more realistic surge to $1,200 by year’s end. XRP Could Skyrocket Even Higher By 150,000% While the Real Remi Relief’s $1,700 price projection for XRP is undeniably bold, the analyst goes even further, speculating that the cryptocurrency’s total upside potential in this cycle could soar as high as 80,000% and 150,000%. This surge could catapult XRP’s current price of $2.4 to an astonishing $1,920 and $3,600, respectively. Related Reading: XRP: Exit Liquidity Pattern Forming Signals Crash To $1 Such gains would not only eclipse XRP’s previous all-time high but also represent one of the most dramatic asset revaluations in crypto history.

In a forward to the bank’s biannual “ Financial Stability Review ,” ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos says markets are still “highly sensitive” to news about global trade arrangements. “Financial market functioning held up well during the recent sell-off. Despite the drawdowns, equity valuations remain high while credit spreads still appear out of sync with underlying credit risk. Open-ended funds investing in corporate bonds have seen some outflows and do not appear well prepared to withstand significant liquidity stress. In the event of renewed turmoil, these funds may be forced to sell assets. This could turn price swings into more disorderly adjustments.” The ECB warns that the European economy has “pronounced” vulnerabilities to a potential trade war due to its integration in global supply chains. The bank also says it’s unclear if the Trump Administration is committed to international cooperation. “While it is hard to predict the medium to long-term implications of these individual layers of uncertainty, they entail a broad risk of geoeconomic fragmentation across the globe, in turn raising the likelihood of increasingly frequent and impactful adverse tail events. Although the announcements of trade agreements between the United States and some of its trading partners point towards an easing of trade tensions, concerns remain that these tensions could escalate into a trade war with the potential for significant adverse impacts on global growth, inflation and asset prices.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Traders are betting on a new crypto bull run that will push Bitcoin ( BTC ) to $150,000 and most altcoins higher. Altcoins likely to do well in the new altcoin season are those with strong fundamentals and technicals. This article compares Polkadot ( DOT ) and Berachain ( BERA ), highlighting the best one to buy and the one to sell or avoid. and highlights the best one to buy and the one to sell or avoid. Crypto to buy: Polkadot Polkadot is one of the most contrarian crypto assets to buy in this bull run. It offers a staking yield of 11.5%, significantly higher than most layer-2 cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum ( ETH ), TRON ( TRX ), and Solana ( SOL ). In addition to strong fundamentals, the main reason DOT is a good buy is that it has remained in a three-year consolidation between $3.76 and $11.33. This consolidation resembles the pattern Monero ( XMR ) followed over the past two years before its eventual surge . DOT appears to be in the accumulation phase of the Wyckoff Theory, which is typically followed by a markup phase. Markup is characterized by higher demand than supply. DOT has also formed a triple bottom at $3.76, a level it has not dropped below since 2023. Therefore, the most likely outlook is a rebound to at least $11.32, a gain of 132% from the current level. A move above that price would signal further upside, potentially to the 50% retracement level at $30, an increase of 500% from its present value.

2025-05-22T18:27:49.000Z,"US stock markets on the verge of a correction as Bitcoin brushes $112,000","The cracks in the US stock market got wider on Thursday as bond yields surged and Wall Street tried to act like nothing was wrong. Stocks edged up, but the numbers were weak and shaky. The Dow Jones added just 156 points. The S&P 500 crawled up by 0.3%, and the Nasdaq squeezed out a 0.7% gain. That came as the 30-year Treasury yield hit 5.14%, the highest it’s been since October 2023, right after lawmakers pushed through a new bill that traders say could make the deficit spiral out of control. That bill, passed in the House early Thursday along party lines, would cut taxes and increase military spending. It’s now on its way to the Senate. The Congressional Budget Office says the total cost could hit $4 trillion, which would blow a hole in the already massive national debt. At the same time, fears of inflation are rising again, partly because of President Trump’s universal tariffs, which are already weighing on bonds and lifting yields even higher. Traders face rising yields, budget blowouts Longer-term yields are climbing fast. The 10-year Treasury also rose during the session but came down a bit later. Still, yields are moving in the wrong direction for borrowers. These are the same rates that shape mortgages, credit card interest, and all kinds of consumer debt. That’s putting pressure on an economy already hit by Trump’s trade moves. Jed Ellerbroek, who manages portfolios at Argent Capital Management, told CNBC, “Short term, the tax bill is good for the economy. It is going to boost GDP growth in 2026. It reduces taxes for lots of people, it increases spending, especially on defense, and so those things are stimulative to the economy.” But Jed didn’t sound optimistic beyond that. “Longer term, yeah, it blows out the deficit. Yields are going higher, which means prices are going down because Treasuries are becoming incrementally less appealing and trustworthy.” The Treasury auction on Wednesday was already a mess. Demand for 20-year bonds dropped hard, which pushed yields even higher and sent stocks into reverse. That selloff hasn’t disappeared, and investors say it could get worse if the Senate passes the same bill. Chris Senyek, chief strategist at Wolfe Research, said in a note Thursday, “Not shockingly, the long-term US fiscal situations is on an unsustainable path with spending levels YTD surprising to the upside again, with only 2020/2021 trends likely to be worse when the US reaches its September fiscal year-end.” He added, “Our sense is bond vigilantes are likely to start ‘pushing back’ on this unsustainable long-term outlook encapsulated in the tax bill working its way through Congress by sending long-term yields higher.” Chris also pointed out that the US is facing a massive pile of debt that will mature in the next 12 months. Combined with unclear inflation risks and uncertainty about how quickly the Federal Reserve can cut rates, there’s plenty of room for more volatility this year. Bitcoin climbs past $112K while investors ditch bonds While stocks and bonds fumbled, Bitcoin surged again . On Thursday, it jumped above $111,000, climbing as high as $111,989.31 before holding steady near $111,578.76 by afternoon. The increase was about 3% on the day. That pushes the total gain for 2025 to over 18% so far. BTC/USDT 15-min price chart. Source: TradingView This rally has been a slow grind—way different from the wild runs of the past. It’s being powered by large players. Big firms are buying. Companies are holding more of it. Bitcoin is being treated more like a safe haven than a gamble. One of the big reasons? Moody’s slapped the US with a fresh debt downgrade, which made a lot of investors run straight to crypto. Bitcoin’s typical link with tech stocks is also starting to fade. It used to move in sync with the Nasdaq, but now it’s heading in its own direction. Some traders say that’s because more people are seeing it as a backup plan for when the dollar becomes unreliable. New numbers show the trend isn’t just talk. Bitcoin ETFs have barely seen any outflows this month, with only two days of outflows in all of May. Data from SoSoValue shows the rest has been non-stop inflows. And it’s not just funds. Public companies are buying bitcoin like crazy. Their holdings are up 31% this year to about $349 billion, making up 15% of all bitcoin in circulation, based on data from Bitcoin Treasuries.

U.S. stock indices inched up on Thursday, even as rising bond yields and concerns over mounting government debt cast uncertainty over the broader economy. On May 22, the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded at 42,013 points, up 153 points or 0.36 percent.

You might also like: Dow Jones posts modest gains as U.S. debt downgrade shakes Wall Street The market’s positive move came despite a climb in bond yields, which have failed to attract significant investor demand. Long-term U.S. Treasury yields crossed the 5 percent threshold, with the 30-year bond yielding 5.128 percent. Typically, rising bond yields pull capital away from equities as investors seek stable, fixed returns. However, the attractiveness of Treasuries has declined, largely due to growing concerns over U.S. dollar-denominated debt and the expanding federal deficit. Are bonds, or Bitcoin, a safe haven? Uncertainty around U.S. fiscal policy has intensified after proposed tax cuts by former President Donald Trump were projected to significantly expand the national deficit. Combined with elevated Treasury yields, the cost of servicing government debt is expected to climb, prompting some investors to reconsider the role of bonds as a traditional safe haven.

As of May 22, the average 30-year fixed mortgage reached 6.86 percent, the highest level since February.

2025-05-22T18:21:23.000Z,"'Major Wake-Up Call': How $400M Coinbase Breach Exposes Crypto's Dark Side","Last week's highly organized breach of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN) left behind more questions than answers. While some hailed Coinbase's response as a \""really great example\"" in dealing with a crisis, the breach has now caused a potentially massive privacy issue that mirrors the Ledger data breach in 2021 — which led to a spate of real-world robberies as criminals were able to get a hold of names and addresses of crypto holders. Coinbase has already acknowledged that its customers may have lost close to half a billion U.S. dollars as a result of its breach. Cybercriminals accessed Coinbase user data by bribing and convincing Coinbase support employees to share that data, but this was entirely preventable, according to numerous experts that spoke to CoinDesk. “A failsafe system would make stealing data technically impossible, but Coinbase clearly didn't prioritize these measures, leaving the door wide open,” Andy Zhou, co-founder of blockchain security firm BlockSec told CoinDesk. Allowing these criminals to access personal data, whether through a hack or, in this case, social engineering, is a major blight on an exchange that facilitates billions of dollars worth of volume every day. The breach created a myriad of issues, including user privacy and trust . How could Coinbase, a publicly traded company, allow attackers to steal personal information and money through the front door? And could it have been prevented? Hackett Communications CEO Heather Dale hailed Coinbase’s response as a “masterclass in communication,” but Coinbase’s method of tackling the issues was simple: throw as much money at it as possible. The exchange offered a $20 million bug bounty for anyone who reported information that would lead to an arrest or prosecution. It also committed to voluntarily reimbursing impacted users with between $180 million to $400 million. What happened? Before analyzing the fallout of the breach, it’s important to understand how exactly the breach occurred at a publicly traded company that spends millions of dollars per month on security infrastructure. In February, on-chain sleuth ZachXBT reported a rise in thefts involving Coinbase users. He said that it was “a result of aggressive risk models and Coinbase’s failure to stop its users losing $300 [million] per year to social engineering scams.” The fear of cybercriminals stealing hundreds of millions of dollars became a reality last week when Coinbase published a blog post revealing that account balances, government ID images, phone numbers, addresses and masked bank account details were stolen. Unlike other hacks and breaches, which involve attackers exploiting a faulty back-end, these attackers went in through the front door—communicating directly with Coinbase employees and buying access to the information via rogue insiders. Coinbase claimed that it fired all responsible employees on the spot, although it did not reveal the method it used to find those responsible in the blog post . The issue, however, is not confined to crypto . In 2022, digital bank Revolut confirmed that 50,000 sets of customer data were stolen, while one year later, trading platform Robinhood had up to 5 million email addresses leaked . The latter was fined $45 million by the SEC following the breach after it emerged that a portion of customers had their accounts wiped by attackers . The BBC reported in October that one particular Revolut user lost £165,000 ($220,0000) following a data breach and that the neobank’s fraud detection system prevented £475 million in fraudulent transactions in 2023. Coinbase competitors Binance and Kraken said they managed to fend off similar social engineering attacks in recent weeks. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong also posted a video on X last week, stating that he received a “ransom note” for $20 million in bitcoin in exchange for these attackers not releasing some information they claimed to have obtained on Coinbase customers. ZachXBT added on Thursday that the attackers began obfuscating the stolen funds by swapping BTC for ETH on Thorchain, a venue often used by the infamous North Korean hackers Lazarus Group. 'Major wake-up call' Andy Zhou, co-founder of blockchain security firm BlockSec, told CoinDesk that Coinbase should have conducted “stricter background checks on employees handling sensitive data \"" and set up “alarms for weird activity” like someone suddenly downloading thousands of customer profiles. Zhou added that Coinbase should have implemented several technical solutions. These include strict role-based access, meaning employees only see necessary data, or privacy tools that allow work without exposing raw details (for example, blurring ID photos). Nick Tausek, lead security automation architect at Swimlane, told CoinDesk that the breach should be a “major wake-up call” for robust insider threat detection. “As outsourcing scales and operations stretch across time zones, insider threat detection and access governance cannot be afterthoughts. A single insider with the right access, or in this case, the wrong incentives, can punch a hole in even the most fortified security posture. Because, as this breach shows, it only takes 1% of customers breached to make 100% of the headlines.” However, not everyone is piling onto Coinbase. Michal Pospieszalk, CEO of MatterFi, said that it “isn’t a Coinbase problem, it’s a systemic vulnerability that’s plagued crypto since day one.” He argued that the nature of sending crypto without an intermediary means that all platforms are one misstep away from disaster. Hackers need to engineer a situation that can trick users into sending their funds in an irreversible transaction. In Coinbase's case, attackers gained access to personally identifiable information from a rogue employee. The root issue, according to Pospieszalsk, is the problem of users not knowing whether they are sending funds to the right recipient, adding that crypto runs on a “trust me, bro” model of identity verification and that is not sustainable. What happens next? Coinbase said it would voluntarily reimburse customers who lost funds during the breach and would continue to work with law enforcement to capture those responsible. But for users, it’s a darker road. The exchange said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday that the breach impacted 69,461 customers. The filing also noted that the breach occurred in December 2024 and was not discovered by Coinbase until May 15. These details are out on the internet now, and may even be for sale on the dark web and in shady Telegram groups. After the Ledger breach, customer details were published on Raidforums , a nefarious data-sharing platform, which led to a rise in phishing attempts. Unfortunately, Coinbase can't do anything to prevent the sharing of this leaked information, leaving the affected users to attempt to put in as many safeguards as possible. These include changing wallets, changing deposit addresses on exchanges and even changing home addresses to avoid the risk of real-world robberies. Users whose social security numbers were leaked should also lock their credit to prevent identity theft. It may be cumbersome, but as seen earlier this year during the attempted kidnapping of Ledger co-founder David Balland (and several other individuals over the past few weeks), criminals will not stop until they extract the maximum amount of funds, even if it means inflicting brutal acts of violence. This also raises a potential legal question: If a Coinbase customer were to be robbed or assaulted due to the data breach, would Coinbase be liable? Ledger failed to escape a proposed class action lawsuit earlier this year, with plaintiffs alleging that Ledger violated its privacy policy and should have had measures in place to prevent the breach. Crypto researcher Molly White also pointed out that Coinbase changed its user agreement in April, adding two clauses limiting class action lawsuits and requiring lawsuits to be filed in New York, with changes being applied on May 15, the same day the breach was announced. Coinbase responded to CoinDesk about White’s claims, stating that the exchange had “notified customers well in advance ” of the user agreement change and that it had a class action waiver in place for “years.” Coinbase did not, however, comment on questions related to whether the breach was preventable or how it will safeguard customers who could be at risk of real-world robberies in the future.

Some thought Hanyecz offered too low a price, citing that 10,000 BTC could be exchanged for only $41, which was not a good amount for two large pizzas and delivery. Others found it hard to order a pizza from outside the U.S. When someone asked Laszlo if he was hungry, he replied : “I just think it would be interesting if I could say that I paid for a pizza in bitcoins.” Consciously or not, this answer emphasizes the original purpose of Bitcoin as an electronic cash system, as is outlined in the Bitcoin white paper by none other than Satoshi Nakamoto. On May 22, Hanyecz stated that he successfully bought two pizzas for 10,000 BTC and posted a link to a photo of two large pizzas and Laszlo with his kids. He added that he is always happy to receive two large pizzas, so his offer is open as long as he has funds. “I usually have plenty,” he said–in 2010, the block reward was 50 BTC. The person who bought Hanyecz pizzas in return for his bitcoins was identified as Jeromy Sturdivant, a Californian student who was 19 years old at that time. In August, the BTC price spiked, and new comments appeared, mockingly asking Hanyecz if he was still going to pay 10,000 BTC ($600) for two pizzas. He replied that he could not do this anymore and thanked everyone (!) who already bought him pizzas. In November 2010, some asked if it was okay to eat pizza for $26,000. As the Bitcoin price continued to grow, more and more people were flocking to the thread, wondering if Laszlo was regretting eating pizza that cost that much (the prices were getting bigger from message to message). As of May 22, 2025, several hours after the Bitcoin price reached another all-time high, 10,000 BTC equals $1.1 billion. What do Hanyecz and Sturdivant think of their trade years later? Sturdivant, who received 10,000 BTC, gave a number of interviews. He said he realized that he was setting a historical precedent while admitting that if he didn’t do that, someone else would eventually buy pizza for Hanyecz. I feel my part wasn’t critical or irreplaceable, but it was an important step to be taken, and I’m glad to have had the opportunity to take it myself. Beyond that, I’m just as excited to take part in the future and don’t have any intention of pining away for the “glory days.” Some publications claim Sturdivant spent all of his bitcoins to travel with his girlfriend, while in the interview, he mentions he spent bitcoins received from Hanyecz when they cost around $400, ten times bigger than at the time of purchase. As for Hanyecz, he said he didn’t perceive spending 10,000 BTC for pizza as an expensive flex. It was the opposite; it was a rare fortune to get rewarded with free food for his hobby of being a network contributor. Usually, hobbies are money sinks, Hanyecz said. “It wasn’t worth much at the time. I wouldn’t have spent $100 million on pizza, right? But if I hadn’t done that, maybe Bitcoin wouldn’t have become so popular.” In 2018, Hanyecz appeared in Bitcoin history again. He was one of the first testers of Lightning Network and ordered two pizzas via his friend, who agreed to take payment in Lightning Network BTC. The transaction went smoothly, and Hanyecz and his family ate two more pizzas that were bought for Bitcoin. You can read a recollection of this event in Hanyecz’s newsletter . Read more: “Bossy, Eccentric, and Kind of Weird”: Laszlo Hanyecz Describes Bitcoin Founder Satoshi Nakamoto 15 years later, the community is still celebrating on social media People remember Bitcoin Pizza Day. Educational posts appear here and there. This time, the Bitcoin Pizza Anniversary nicely coincided with another historic achievement–the Bitcoin price exceeded $111,500 for the first time. https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1925542057126338870 Isabella Santos, a founder of BTC Isla and many other Bitcoin-related projects, celebrated the new Bitcoin ATH and Pizza Day by eating a pizza for which she paid in Bitcoin. This is especially remarkable as Santos is busy turning the Mexican island of Isla Mujeres into a Bitcoin hub and has helped over 17 local businesses to start accepting Bitcoin. https://twitter.com/isabellasg3/status/1925238948449640652 Pierre Rochard, Bitcoin Bond company CEO, and an avid Bitcoin advocate, wished a happy Bitcoin Pizza Day while asking why someone needs two pizzas when they can easily be sliced in two instead. Well, probably, that’s because they had no halvings back in 2010. Seeing a lot of pizza influencers promoting pizza today. Here’s the problem with pizza: it’s infinitely divisible. Why buy two pizzas when you can just cut one in half? They never have an honest answer to this simple question. Regardless, happy pizza day! — Pierre Rochard (@BitcoinPierre) May 22, 2025 An X account of Zerohedge media has brought an interesting parallel, pointing out that the current cost of these two Papa John’s pizzas got close to Papa John’s entire market cap. https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/1925518344045703597 If we take a look at the comments to such posts, we will see that the regret narrative (“guy spent millions on pizza, poor he”) that was strong for years has been changed with a legend narrative (“the man is a legend”). People are increasingly supportive of a person who literally made Bitcoin valuable in the real-world economy. They don’t mock him or laugh at him anymore. However, the name of Sturdivant is still less prominent than the name of Hanyecz. What’s the meaning of Bitcoin Pizza Day? In Laszlo’s pizza thread on BitcoinTalk, one of the users wrote in 2016: “Imagine if he wouldn’t of bought that pizza and saved that 10k bitcoins right now. He would have 5 million dollars! That would be awesome.” Another user replied: “Not necessary. The circulation of bitcoin gives its value. If he does not buy the pizza with the bitcoin, the bitcoin is worth nothing.” That is an important point. While Michael Saylor and others may argue that Bitcoin is not fit for being a means of exchange but rather serves as a capital that should not be spent or sold, the initial purpose of Bitcoin was serving as a money network that doesn’t have the flaws of the banking system. Bitcoin is a trustless peer-to-peer payment system, and Hanyecz was the first to try buying something with bitcoins and succeeded, thanks to Sturdivant. Before Bitcoin Pizza Day, Bitcoin was living only within the code lines. On May 22, it was born into a physical world, making its first tiny impact on the real-life economy (electricity bills of miners aside). Hanyecz probably missed some long-term returns, but he hit the gas of the Bitcoin vehicle, making use of it while others were sitting still after switching the ignition. He believed that Bitcoin could actually work as money and set the precedent that, 15 years later, still makes Bitcoin valuable.

White House Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency Advisor David Sacks participated in CNBC’s “Closing Bell Overtime” program and made important statements about both artificial intelligence regulations and the stablecoin bill. Sacks, who touched on the subject of artificial intelligence and chip export controls, said that while they stand behind the chip export restrictions to China, those controls for the rest of the world should be reconsidered. “When America competes, it wins. We don’t want advanced semiconductors to end up in China, but we should support other countries to build on American technology infrastructure,” Sacks said. Related News: Standard Chartered Stands Firm on $500,000 Bitcoin Price: Here's Why Sacks, who also drew attention to the energy needs of artificial intelligence, recalled the energy deficit announced by Elon Musk for “AI factories” and stated that the Trump administration intends to deregulate the energy sector. “We need to produce more electricity. We need to ease permitting processes and build data centers,” he said. Answering questions about the stablecoin bill, Sacks said that they received the support of 15 Democratic senators in the Senate vote and that they expect the bill to pass. Stating that this regulation will provide new, cheap and efficient payment infrastructures to the American economy, Sacks said, “Stablecoins will increase the dollar’s dominance in the digital world and create a trillion-dollar demand for treasury bonds.” He argued that stablecoins will be effective immediately once the legal framework is provided. *This is not investment advice.

Morgan Stanley offers a contrasting view, warning of stagflation and recession for US economy in 2025. Despite uncertainty, Bitcoin (BTC) hits new ATH as investors seek alternative havens like gold. Senior Investment Strategist at Standard Chartered Bank, Foo Ken Yap, has predicted that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates despite expectations to the contrary from various market quarters. According to Yap, the Fed will likely take the unexpected action to cushion the bond market impact and lend support to the overall economic growth.

2025-05-22T18:10:45.000Z,"Strategy stock continues to stall despite Bitcoin’s surge to record high","Bitcoin price surged to a record high this week, supported by rising institutional demand and falling supply on exchanges and over-the-counter markets. Bitcoin ( BTC ) was trading at around $111,500 Thursday afternoon, up 4.2% over the past 24 hours. Despite Bitcoin’s strength, the rally is not lifting Strategy stock. MSTR was trading flat for the day at around $403. This performance suggests that the previously strong correlation between Bitcoin and MSTR has broken. There are two main reasons for this divergence. First, Strategy investors are increasingly concerned about ongoing dilution, as the company continues to borrow heavily to finance its Bitcoin purchases. The chart below shows that common shares outstanding have risen from 75.5 million in 2020 to 246 million today. MSTR stock dilution | Source: TradingView This dilution will continue as Strategy revealed that it was selling $2.1 billion in preferred stock sales to fuel Bitcoin purchases. You might also like: Pi Network price could miss out on the crypto bull run as insiders sell In the long term, the company also plans to raise up to 84 billion dollars, equivalent to 76 percent of its current market capitalization. While most of this capital will go toward Bitcoin purchases, some will support broader corporate initiatives. MSTR stock has underperformed Bitcoin as investors question its valuation and mounting losses. The company currently holds 576,230 coins valued at over 64 billion dollars, while its market cap stands at 110 billion dollars. Some analysts believe the valuation gap will eventually narrow, with MSTR’s stock price aligning more closely to the value of its Bitcoin holdings. Meanwhile, Strategy’s soaring losses have added pressure. In its most recent quarterly report, operating expenses jumped to 6 billion dollars, while the net loss widened to 4.1 billion dollars. Revenue fell 3.6 percent year-over-year to 111 million dollars, missing analyst expectations. Investor skepticism has also been fueled by short-sellers. Jim Chanos, a well-known short-seller, revealed a short position in MSTR, alleging that the company is artificially inflating its stock price. Andrew Left of Citron Research issued a similar warning last year, claiming the company operates like a pyramid scheme. MSTR stock price analysis Strategy stock chart | Source: TradingView The daily chart shows that Strategy stock has been trading sideways in recent days, although it remains above the 50-day and 100-day exponential moving averages, which is typically viewed as a bullish signal. The price has formed a bullish pennant pattern, made up of a flagpole and a converging triangle. Before this, it developed a double-bottom formation with support at 237 dollars and a neckline at 343 dollars. Given the improving sentiment in the crypto sector, a breakout to the all-time high of 542 dollars remains a possibility. That move would represent a potential upside of 33 percent from current levels.

2025-05-22T18:02:33.000Z,"Strategy Moves to Raise $2.1B From Shares to Buy More Bitcoin","Strategy, the software intelligence company formerly known as MicroStrategy, is once again doubling down on Bitcoin (BTC). The firm announced earlier today that it plans to sell up to $2.1 billion worth of preferred stock. The money raised will mainly go toward buying more Bitcoin, reinforcing the company’s long-standing bet on the digital asset. Strategy To Sell Preferred Stock With Major Partnerships Strategy announced that it will sell its 10.00% Series A Perpetual Preferred Stock shares under the ticker “STRF” on Nasdaq. The Nasdaq-listed company has made a deal with TD Securities, Barclays Capital, and the Benchmark Company to handle the sales. Depending on market conditions, these firms will act as agents and can sell the shares over time. Notably, no set number of shares must be sold, and the agents are not required to hit any sales target. They will receive a fee of up to 2% of what they sell. The returns from this stock sale will not be kept in escrow, and the company can use the funds as needed. The stock is trading at $100.65 as of May 21. The new shares will carry the same terms as the 8.5 million already in circulation. Strategy New STRF Offering Brings Flexibility Amid Legal Heat The new share offering allows Strategy to sell shares when market conditions are right. This allows the company to raise money without rushing or locking into strict terms. Each share is worth $100 and pays a 10% yearly dividend. However, this 10% dividend is not guaranteed. It depends on whether the company has enough money and whether the board agrees to pay it. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin-focused firm is currently facing serious legal trouble . A group of investors recently filed a class action lawsuit against Strategy. The complaints accused the firm of making false and misleading statements about its profits and the risks associated with its large Bitcoin holdings . Bitcoin at the Center of Strategy’s Future This offering comes as Bitcoin just hit a new all-time high . Earlier today, the asset price briefly touched $111,861 before easing back to around $111,000. For Strategy, this is a strong signal to keep investing in Bitcoin. As of May 21, Strategy owns 576,230 BTC. Starting in August 2020, these were bought at an average price of $69,726 per Bitcoin. At today’s value, those holdings are worth just under $64 billion, nearly 59% more than the company initially paid. Bitcoin now accounts for more than half of Strategy’s total market value, which is $111.4 billion. This latest stock offering will help the company buy more Bitcoin and support its general business needs.

2025-05-22T18:00:23.000Z,"XRP Futures ETF Is Now Live on Nasdaq. Here’s How Investors Can Benefit","In a landmark development for both the digital asset sector and traditional finance, the first-ever XRP Futures Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) has officially gone live on the Nasdaq. According to an announcement from the X-based community Ripplexity, the ETF, launched by Volatility Shares, marks a historic step forward for the mainstream adoption of XRP by providing regulated exposure to its price through futures contracts. This milestone places XRP alongside the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum, both of which have seen their futures-based ETFs open doors for traditional investors to participate in crypto markets without direct custody of the digital asset. For XRP, this debut on one of the world’s leading stock exchanges signals not only increased legitimacy but also a broader opportunity for diversification within institutional and retail investment portfolios. BREAKING: XRP Futures ETF is now LIVE on Nasdaq! Volatility Shares launches the first-ever XRP futures ETF, giving investors regulated exposure to XRP via derivatives. A historic moment for mainstream adoption. #XRP #ETF #Ripple #Nasdaq #XRPL pic.twitter.com/eJfI3WmjqG — Ripplexity (@RippleXity) May 22, 2025 Bridging Traditional Finance and Crypto Futures ETFs have become an essential bridge between legacy financial systems and the evolving digital asset space. By tracking XRP’s futures contracts rather than its spot market price, the newly listed ETF allows investors to gain exposure to XRP without needing to manage private wallets, engage with crypto exchanges, or confront regulatory uncertainty directly. This structure is particularly attractive to risk-conscious institutions and traditional asset managers who must adhere to strict compliance and custody protocols. With the ETF listed on Nasdaq and regulated by U.S. financial authorities, it adds a new layer of credibility and risk mitigation to XRP-based investment products. Moreover, as demand for crypto-linked financial instruments grows, the XRP Futures ETF represents a signal to the broader market that institutional appetite is expanding beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. XRP’s inclusion reflects its growing relevance in global finance, particularly in the cross-border payments sector , where it continues to demonstrate real-world utility. What This Means for XRP’s Market Dynamics The launch of an XRP Futures ETF could serve as a powerful catalyst for increased market liquidity and price discovery. Futures products often bring new volumes and investor behavior into play, which can deepen market participation and enhance overall trading efficiency. Because futures contracts are leveraged instruments, they often draw in more active traders, including hedge funds and algorithmic strategies. This can contribute to tighter spreads, greater volatility, and higher trading volume—key ingredients for a dynamic and responsive market environment. While it’s important to note that futures-based ETFs don’t require the direct purchase of XRP tokens, their existence still influences demand indirectly. As more institutional investors take interest in XRP through regulated channels, the ecosystem surrounding the asset—including spot trading, custody solutions, and liquidity provisioning—will naturally expand. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Boost for XRP’s Broader Adoption Narrative This ETF launch arrives at a time when Ripple, the company closely associated with XRP, is advancing its global ambitions in blockchain-powered finance. From central bank digital currency (CBDC) partnerships to regulatory clarity in major jurisdictions, the XRP ecosystem is steadily aligning with the needs of the modern financial system. By offering exposure to XRP in a traditional investment wrapper, the Volatility Shares ETF can act as an entry point for investors who were previously hesitant due to the complexities of the crypto space. It reduces friction, simplifies access, and opens the door to the trillions of dollars managed in pension funds, ETFs, mutual funds, and other institutional vehicles. This development also reinforces XRP’s role as one of the most actively used and recognized digital assets for real-time payments and settlement. As investor awareness and adoption grow through regulated instruments like ETFs, XRP’s long-term value proposition becomes more visible to a mainstream audience. A Defining Moment for XRP The launch of the XRP Futures ETF on Nasdaq marks a watershed moment in the evolution of crypto-financial products. Volatility Shares’ move to bring XRP into the ETF arena is more than a technical achievement—it’s a statement about the asset’s maturity, resilience, and future potential. With regulatory scrutiny still high across the broader crypto market, a Nasdaq-listed product offering exposure to XRP sends a clear message: the demand for secure, transparent, and regulated access to digital assets is only accelerating. For investors, this presents a timely opportunity to engage with XRP in a framework that meets the standards of traditional finance while offering exposure to the innovation of the blockchain era. As Ripplexity aptly noted, this is a historic moment—not just for XRP, but for the broader convergence of crypto and conventional finance.

2025-05-22T17:50:39.000Z,"This Viral Asset Management Platform is Offering Better Staking Rewards Than Cardano","The Cardano price has been recovering with increasing momentum over the past few weeks due to the renewed bullish sentiment in the broader market. Meanwhile, Unilabs (UNIL), an emerging AI project, outshone ADA’s demand and went viral after revealing up to 122% APYs on staking, surpassing Cardano’s usual up to 7% APY by a significant margin. The AI-powered asset management platform has raised over $30 million in assets under management, highlighting its growing user base. The Unilabs presale has sold over 163 million worth of tokens within two weeks of public launch, setting new standards for ICOs. Experts suggest Unilabs’ staking utility and diverse practical use cases put it in a better position than the Cardano price in the upcoming utility-driven bull leg. Let’s understand how the rising UNIL token can surpass ADA’s growth by the end of the year. Cardano Price Prediction: Is ADA Entering A Bearish Phase? The Cardano price swiftly bounced from the $0.5 support level as the crypto market bulls finally woke up last month after a long silence in the first quarter of 2025. With the introduction of fresh capital, ADA established an upward trend and gained nearly 50% within one and a half months. Last week, the Cardano price lost upward momentum, due to which it reversed from the $0.84 resistance. After a 3.8% intraday surge, it currently trades at $0.756. ADA has been consolidating at the $0.72 support level for the previous few days, where bullish pressure has kept it from falling. Image source: CoinMarketCap If demand declines and bears take control, the Cardano price may slip below the immediate $0.72 support and drop out of the short-term ascending channel. However, if the broader market continues to recover, it can help ADA resume the rally and reach the longer-term resistance at $1.15. Unilabs (UNIL): Earn Passive Income With AI-Backed Portfolios While the Cardano price struggles to maintain bullish momentum, Unilabs is rising steadily, breaking key milestones in its live presale. The UNIL presale has surpassed the $750,000 mark in the first ten days, highlighting the tremendous demand for the undervalued token. With its advanced AI-backed asset management platform, Unilabs is at the forefront of DeFi’s next era. It allows users to invest in growing projects without actively monitoring the market. The platform offers four fund baskets: BTC, AI, RWA, and Mining, which are entirely managed by Unilabs’ AI. The AI scans early-stage opportunities as they arrive in the market and continuously rebalances the $30 million locked capital in these baskets to generate the sector’s highest returns. Users who invest in these funds receive periodic dividends directly in their linked wallets. UNIL Staking Rewards Apart from the consistent fund profits, users can also earn impressive staking rewards by locking in their UNIL tokens. Staking helps keep the ecosystem running by maintaining proper liquidity. Unilabs provides up to 122% APY on staking and offers occasional bonus rewards using a share of the platform’s revenue. UNIL is currently priced at the low price of $0.0051 in stage two of the presale. The token’s value has surged 27.5% over the past week, as the stage one price was $0.004. New investors can make similar gains when UNIL reaches a valuation of $0.0062 in the third stage. Conclusion As the Cardano price action becomes uncertain, ADA investors are moving towards rising projects such as Unilabs, which can offer better growth in the 2025 bull market. The UNIL presale offers an excellent option for investors who are looking for stable and predictable returns in the next stage of the new bull cycle.

2025-05-22T17:46:09.000Z,"Bitcoin Reaches Fresh ATH – Could This Trigger Another Rally for SOL and ETH Like January’s Surge? Here's What to Expect","Bitcoin has hit a new all-time high , hinting at potential ripple effects in the crypto market. This surge raises questions about whether Solana and Ethereum could see significant gains, similar to the explosive growth witnessed in January. Key factors and expert opinions will reveal which coins are poised to follow Bitcoin's impressive climb. ETH Price Dynamics: Surge in Month, Correction Over Six Months Last month ETH saw a 67.11% price boost and a six-month decline of 20.69%. This reflects a rapid recovery in the short term, contrasted by longer-term weakness. The recent price surge has shown impressive momentum, highlighting volatility in the market. Strong monthly gains stand out against a backdrop of extended bearish pressure, showcasing the coin's fluctuating behavior. Current price ranges from $1468.66 to $2037.85, with key resistance at $2280.82 and support at $1142.44. Bulls are trying to take charge near the upper range, but the absence of a strong trend suggests a cautious approach. Trading within these levels could mean targeting gains as resistance is approached while looking to enter on dips at support. SOL’s Rebound Amid Mixed Long-Term Trends SOL experienced nearly a 30% rise over the past month despite a 31% decline over the last six months. The one-week change remains minimal at 0.12%, indicating short-term steadiness against broader volatility. Recent price movements highlight a short-term bounce off negative trends long term, suggesting anticipation for an upcoming altcoin season amid overall market uncertainty. Current trading sees SOL moving within a range of about $110 to $171 , with key resistance levels at $194.93 and $256.57 and support at $71.65, with a secondary support near $10.01. RSI stands at 62.62, with oscillators signaling limited momentum. Bulls may push higher if resistance is broken, while bears maintain pressure. Trading within these levels offers short-term opportunities. Conclusion Bitcoin's new all-time high presents a promising scenario for other cryptocurrencies. If history repeats itself, a surge similar to January’s could drive SOL and ETH upwards. Investors may see this as an opportunity to diversify or increase their holdings in these coins. Past trends suggest that significant movements in Bitcoin often impact other major cryptocurrencies. Both SOL and ETH have shown potential to benefit from Bitcoin's momentum. Hence, market participants might expect a positive ripple effect, leading to possible price increases in SOL and ETH following Bitcoin's performance.

2025-05-22T17:45:40.000Z,"Altcoins update: HYPE and AVAX rally as BTC hits new ATHs; SUI plunges after $260M hack","Cryptocurrencies dominated the financial space as Bitcoin broke past $110,000 with bullish momentum . While most altcoins mirror Bitcoin’s bullish momentum with promising price structures, Hyperliquid (HYPE), Avalanche (AVAX), and Sui (SUI) topped trends for different reasons. Let us find out more. Hyperliquid breaks record as Bitcoin whales charge HYPE was among the most-watched altcoins amid the ongoing broad-based rallies. That comes as DEX Hyperliquid attained all-time highs in key metrics: Open Interest, daily fees, and USD Coin total value locked. The surge came as a large-scale investor sparked the crypto market by increasing its existing 40x long BTC trade to $1.1 billion – the first-ever bet to exceed $1 billion on the Hyperliquid DEX. X users and high-risk trader James Wynn claims to have opened the massive position, which sits well above the $103,790 liquidation price as Bitcoin hovers at $111,109.

Stability beyond $30 could support upswings to $35, above which the alt can soar to $48. That would translate to a 52% increase from Hyperliquid’s current price. AVAX soars on FIFA deal and tech upgrade Avalanche jumped from $22 to surpass $25 in the past 24 hours, driven by broad market sentiments and bullish ecosystem progress. Two announcements by the Avalanche Foundation fueled AVAX’s optimistic trajectory. Firstly, the project has signed a strategic deal with FIFA to introduce web3 experiences for football fanatics. Avalanche Foundation 🔺 @AvalancheFDN · Follow Avalanche 🤝 @FIFAcom Come and get your Avalanche football scarf to celebrate! ⚽️🔺 1:13 PM · May 22, 2025 605 Reply Copy link Read 36 replies The alliance will likely attract millions of new participants to the Avalanche ecosystem, a perfect catalyst for the blockchain’s long-term stability. Moreover, the Avalanche Fusion launch added to the altcoin’s upside. The new interoperability aims to connect Avalanche’s subnets with different networks more efficiently. These developments have renewed interest in AVAX, extending recoveries that started mid-last month. SUI’s price tumbles after massive hack While most altcoins print green candlesticks, Sui investors experienced a devastating blow as hackers accessed the protocol’s top liquidity provider , draining $260 million in assets. Meanwhile, the hacking news sent SUI down from $4.1923 to $3.7727 – a 10% dip- before a slight recovery to $3.95 at press time. Its trading volume has increased by 166% in the past 24 hours, possibly signaling investors exiting positions to avoid further losses. At the same time, CETUS plummeted from $0.2556 to $0.1488, losing over 40% minutes after the hack. Source – Coinmarketcap The Cetus attack has attracted widespread fears , raising worries about LP (liquidity provider) management and smart contract security. Meanwhile, the incident showcases how fraudsters target innocent crypto enthusiasts, especially during market rallies. The latest developments suggest that the team has frozen $160 million of the stolen $220 million, set for a return. While the Sui team continues to recover the stolen assets, Bitcoin will set the market tone. BTC trades at $111,419, targeting the $116,000 mark. Such trends will support extended gains in the altcoin market. However, losing the $110,000 level will delay the uptrends in the short term.

2025-05-22T17:39:37.000Z,"Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson Says ADA Can Power DeFi Ecosystems for Bitcoin, XRP, Litecoin and Dogecoin","As one of the first blockchains anchored on peer-reviewed academic research, Cardano (ADA) continues to emphasize governance and decentralization. This explains why Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson is optimistic that ADA can power decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems for cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), XRP, and Bitcoin. Hoskinson’s point of view might be based on the fact that Cardano combines security architecture, scalability, smart contract functionality, and interoperability features. Fueling the DeFi networks of various cryptos is a welcome move since it will enhance Cardano’s adoption rate. Is Cardano Eyeing a Surprise Move to $1? Thanks to the general bullish momentum in the crypto market, which has seen Bitcoin soar to a new all-time high of $111,544, Cardano has reclaimed the psychological price of $0.75 with its eyes set on breaching the $0.80 zone. According to CoinGecko data, ADA was up by 25.2% in the past month to hit $0.8 at the time of writing. The ninth-largest cryptocurrency based on market capitalization might as well be contemplating a major leg up to $1. Market analyst Lingrid acknowledged, “ADA is rebounding from support after an extended correction within a broad channel. Multiple range breakouts show growing bullish intent beneath resistance. Price is now coiling near a key trendline intersection. If momentum builds, ADA may finally test the major downtrend ceiling. A surprise thrust toward $0.95 could shake the market.” Source: Lingrid Therefore, breaching the major downtrend ceiling will see Cardano soar to the psychological price of $1. Meanwhile, Cardano whales have been on a buying spree after recently amassing more than 80 million ADA, worth a whopping $57 million.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/cardanos-charles-hoskinson-says-ada-can-power-defi-ecosystems-for-bitcoin-xrp-litecoin-and-dogecoin/,"ADA|BTC|DOGE|LTC|TRADING","Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Bitcoin News|Cardano|Charles Hoskinson|Dogecoin|Litecoin|XRP News",cryptocompare
2025-05-22T17:37:53.000Z,"Texas Bitcoin Reserve Wins 105-23 Vote – Could a $2.7T State Ignite Crypto Arms Race?","Key Takeaways: Texas joins New Hampshire as the second U.S. state to legalize a Bitcoin reserve, pending the governor’s approval. SB 21 allows the comptroller to buy only cryptos with a $500B+ market cap. Corporate Bitcoin holdings outpace governments, but Texas could shift the balance if the reserve grows. On May 21, Texas lawmakers passed Senate Bill 21 (SB 21). The bill, backed by both parties, paves the way for a state Bitcoin reserve and is awaiting final approval. Texas House passes SB 21 to establish a Strategic #Bitcoin Reserve. The bill cleared its final vote 101-42. pic.twitter.com/6li1OaumPl — TFTC (@TFTC21) May 21, 2025 The bill easily passed the House with strong support, 105-23 in its second reading and 101-42 in its third. This rare show of unity suggests Governor Greg Abbott will likely sign it. If approved, Texas will become the second U.S. state (after New Hampshire ) with a Bitcoin reserve. Abbott is expected to support the bill. He has backed crypto for years, even accepting crypto campaign donations since 2014, in a bid to make Texas “the crypto capital.” Observers doubt he’ll say no. How SB 21 Reshapes Texas’s Financial Future with Bitcoin SB 21 gives the state comptroller the power to buy and hold Bitcoin and any other cryptocurrency whose market capitalization tops $500 billion for 12 consecutive months, but right now, only Bitcoin meets the bar. The comptroller would manage the reserve, invest surplus funds, and cover administrative expenses with proceeds generated by the holdings. However, the Legislative Budget Board admits it’s still unclear how big the reserve could be or what financial impact it might have. Representative Giovanni Capriglione, who pushed the bill in the House, called the vote “a pivotal moment in securing Texas’s leadership with a modern store of value for future promise.” Supporters argue that adding Bitcoin to the treasury diversifies state assets and shows Texas’s openness to blockchain innovation. With a $2.7 trillion economy and a fast-growing Bitcoin mining industry, Texas would become the largest government in the world to hold Bitcoin. The Crypto Divide: Which States Are Leading and Why Others Are Hesitant America’s states are divided on Bitcoin as some have rushed to embrace it, while others continue to push back hard. On May 6, New Hampshire blazed the trail, becoming the first state to let its treasury hold Bitcoin. Now, Texas stands ready to follow. North Carolina is following suit with nearly identical House and Senate proposals currently awaiting floor votes, while crypto-friendly Wyoming is considering legislation that would grant its treasurer direct Bitcoin purchasing authority. However, resistance persists in other states. New Hampshire just became the first U.S. state to legally adopt Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. HB 302 lets the treasurer park up to 5 % in Bitcoin. Game on. pic.twitter.com/ACabIV3zxe — Swan (@Swan) May 6, 2025 In Arizona, the governor rejected a BTC reserve proposal, while Florida’s legislature withdrew two similar measures. Montana said no, fearing the wild price swings of the crypto market. Across the country, 47 Bitcoin bills sit on lawmakers’ desks in 26 states. About half are still under active consideration. Meanwhile, in Washington, 13 proposals float the idea of a national Bitcoin vault filled with seized coins. Treasurers and officials now weigh custody, compliance, and price swings. Yet more states (and countries) indicate that holding Bitcoin as a strategic asset has moved from a fringe idea to a serious fiscal debate. Bitcoin Reserve — Mayer Mizrachi (@Mayer) May 16, 2025 Internationally, Panama City Mayor Mayer Mizrachi teased plans for a municipal Bitcoin reserve after meeting El Salvador advisers Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert, posting “Bitcoin Reserve” on X. Bitcoin’s Biggest Buyers: Corporations vs. Governments—Who’s Winning? Kyiv is prepping its Bitcoin reserve plans. MP Yaroslav Zhelezniak confirmed that a draft bill to establish a state Bitcoin reserve is nearly complete. Crypto exchange Binance supports its efforts as the country seeks to strengthen its financial resilience during its war with Russia. Meanwhile, corporations continue to snap up Bitcoin at a record pace. Strategy, the pioneer of the corporate BTC plan, recently upped its fundraising targets to $84 billion, planning fresh equity and debt sales to expand the largest corporate BTC treasury. Their latest purchase of 13,390 BTC for $1.34 billion happened on May 12. JUST IN: Michael Saylor said Strategy is doubling their fundraising to raise $84 billion to buy more #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/NPg0E5GLF2 — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) May 1, 2025 Earlier, Japanese firm Metaplanet spent ¥18.4 billion ($126 million) on 1,241 BTC (within the same period) and lifted its stockpile to 6,796 Bitcoin. These moves reflect a broader pattern. Publicly listed firms boosted their combined reserves by 16.1% in Q1 2025, taking corporate holdings to roughly 688,000 BTC, or about 3.3% of the asset’s total supply. Governments are catching up. The U.S. leads stakeholders, with global nations estimated to control between 463,741 and 527,737 BTC (2.2%–2.5% of supply). Frequently Asked Questions(FAQs) Could Texas’s Bitcoin reserve face federal regulatory hurdles? Federal agencies might challenge it. The SEC could argue that Bitcoin qualifies as a security, while the Treasury may raise monetary policy concerns. However, states traditionally control their reserves, setting up a potential showdown over financial sovereignty. Does Texas’s move pressure other states to accelerate crypto adoption? Absolutely. Texas just upped the ante. Crypto-friendly states will scramble to keep pace, while skeptics dig in, and this domino effect could reshape state-level crypto policy nationwide within months.

Waters said the Stop Trading, Retention, and Unfair Market Payoffs (TRUMP) in Crypto Act of 2025 bill would be aimed at blocking the US President, Vice President, members of Congress, and their families from engaging in “crypto crime.” The US lawmaker referred to Trump and his wife, Melania, issuing personal memecoins in January, his family launching a stablecoin, USD1, through the crypto platform World Liberty Financial, and the president attempting to establish a national Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve as his sons back a BTC mining venture. “Donald Trump is preparing to dine with the top donors of his memecoin who’ve made him, and his family, richer,” said Waters, adding: “Trump’s crypto con is not just a scam to target investors. It’s also a dangerous backdoor for selling influence over American policies to the highest foreign bidder.” HR 3573, Stop TRUMP in Crypto Act of 2025, introduced by Rep. Maxine Waters. Source: House Financial Services Committee Democrats Waters’ bill was one of many actions announced to oppose the president’s dinner to reward memecoin holders. Senators Chris Murphy and Elizabeth Warren are expected to attend a press event with representatives for the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, and two Democratic organizations will protest at the Trump National Golf Club outside Washington, DC, where the memecoin dinner will be held. Majority of participants have stayed anonymous ahead of dinner The number and names of attendees to the May 22 dinner were still largely unknown, but several revealed their intentions through social media and news outlets to apply for background checks and meet the president. Bloomberg reported that more than half of the participants eligible for the dinner and “VIP Tour” — a separate experience limited to the top 25 memecoin holders — were likely foreign nationals. Among those claiming to attend included Tron founder Justin Sun, Hyperithm co-CEO Oh Sangrok, Kronos Research chief investment officer Vincent Liu, and Synthetix founder Kain Warwick. Sun posted to X on May 21, showing him appearing to gain access to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building in Washington, DC, which is part of the White House’s compound. Related: What to expect at Trump’s memecoin dinner Since the launch of the TRUMP memecoin on Jan. 17, many lawmakers and industry figures, including some generally supportive of the president’s policies, have criticized the project as a cash grab. In a May 20 article, the conservative-leaning Wall Street Journal Editorial Board called on the White House to disclose the names of those attending the dinner, adding that Trump would “help himself by calling off his Thursday gala.” Two organizations behind the TRUMP token are tied directly to the president and control roughly 80% of the total supply, opening up the potential for a rug pull in the future. In the previous 24 hours, the price of the memecoin has risen more than 11%, to $15.76 from $14.13.

The Bitcoin development company will issue up to $2.1 billion of preferred stock and use the proceeds to buy more of the flagship crypto. Strategy’s $2.1B Stock Raise To Buy Bitcoin Strategy, one of the world’s largest publicly listed corporate Bitcoin holders, has announced the pricing of its latest round of Preferred Strife Perpetual stock, which the firm does before announcing more Bitcoin buys. The company has entered into a sales agreement to issue and sell up to $2.1 billion worth of shares of STRF via an at-the-market (ATM) program. Each share has a liquidation preference of $100 and has the same terms as the 8.5 million already outstanding. STRF, which offers a 10% annual cash dividend, is only available to institutional investors. The STRF shares will be sold gradually and strategically over a period of time through a sales agreement with TD Securities, Barclays Capital, and The Benchmark Company, which will act as sales agents. Of course, the Tysons Corner, Virginia-based firm said it plans to use the proceeds for “general corporate purposes,” including purchasing more Bitcoin — padding its stash of 576,230 BTC currently valued at over $63 billion. For context, the Saylor-founded company now owns more than 2.7% of Bitcoin’s total 21 million supply. The timing of the latest offering coincides with a fresh all-time high price for Bitcoin.

2025-05-22T17:15:00.000Z,"Bitcoin Just Smashed Past $111,000: Here’s Why Analysts Believe MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Deliver Even Higher Returns Than BTC in 2025","Bitcoin has just rewritten crypto history. On May 22, 2025 , BTC blasted through its previous all-time high, reaching a staggering $111,861.22 —a record-breaking move fueled by institutional inflows, ETF demand, and a positive macro shift. While headlines rightly focus on Bitcoin’s climb, analysts are increasingly turning their attention to an emerging contender: MAGACOIN FINANCE . The question now circulating among seasoned investors is simple: Could MAGACOIN FINANCE outperform Bitcoin in 2025? Bitcoin’s Rally Sets the Stage for Altcoin Rotation BTC’s push past $111K came after a months-long period of sideways movement. Now, Bitcoin is trading above $111,300 with a 24-hour volume of nearly $91 billion , and a market cap soaring to $2.21 trillion . This rally isn’t just a flash in the pan—it’s been catalyzed by powerful forces: U.S. spot ETF inflows dramatically increased after the SEC’s earlier 2025 approvals, driving sustained institutional demand. On-chain data shows Bitcoin whales have added over 83,000 BTC in the last month alone. Geopolitical de-escalation and regulatory clarity—including movement on a U.S. stablecoin bill—have added confidence to crypto markets. But with Bitcoin now hitting major resistance between $112,000–$115,000 , traders are asking what comes next. Many believe a significant altcoin rotation is imminent—and MAGACOIN FINANCE is on the shortlist of tokens poised to benefit. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Drawing Analyst Attention While Bitcoin’s rise has been extraordinary, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in its early innings. Despite that, it’s already catching serious attention thanks to: High community momentum and early-stage traction Presale gains that have attracted both retail and speculative capital A unique political narrative that appeals to crypto-native investors and traditional audiences alike According to early market data and analyst projections, MAGACOIN FINANCE has the potential to deliver 25x to 35x gains if broader retail and institutional flows shift toward high-upside altcoins during this next leg of the bull run. One analyst noted, “Bitcoin’s move to $111K has confirmed the bull market is fully here. What we typically see now is capital flowing into undervalued, high-hype altcoins. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the few that checks all the boxes—fresh, relevant, and still early.” Key Catalysts Supporting MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Breakout Potential Several technical and macroeconomic signals suggest that MAGACOIN FINANCE could be on the verge of a major price discovery moment: Altcoin rotation phase beginning: With BTC dominance potentially peaking, many investors are reallocating to altcoins for higher ROI potential. Retail interest expanding: Similar to past cycles, once BTC gains slow, attention shifts toward low-cost tokens with aggressive upside narratives. Psychological milestones: MAGACOIN FINANCE has already crossed early presale targets and is now entering a discovery zone—where exponential momentum typically kicks in. Bitcoin vs MAGACOIN FINANCE: ROI Potential in 2025 Bitcoin may continue its push toward $118K–$131K , but its ROI potential from here is likely more modest. A move from $111K to $150K would represent roughly 35% upside . Compare that to MAGACOIN FINANCE, which analysts say could realistically move 25x to 35x from its current presale levels. That’s a 2,400% to 3,400% upside , according to current projections—a massive gap that many early investors are keen to exploit. Final Thoughts: A Crypto Rotation You Don’t Want to Miss Bitcoin’s $111K milestone has reignited confidence across the board—but it’s also triggered the start of the 2025 altcoin cycle . As analysts have seen in past cycles, coins like Ethereum, Solana, and XRP surged after Bitcoin’s peak momentum periods. This time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is in position to lead that charge . For savvy investors looking beyond BTC and hunting for explosive, early-stage opportunities, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a rare window. The smart money is already watching. The only question left is: Will you be early—or just too late?

In a new thread, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 787,600 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin may soon increase by more than 82% of its current value. The analyst believes an increasing number of investors will move their wealth into Bitcoin due to its scarcity and store of value attributes as the US dollar weakens. “Bitcoin is going to an all-time high faster than I expected: $120,000 is imminent, $150,000 is imminent, $200,000 is imminent. Why? Because more and more people are done with the constant devaluation of the dollar.” Bitcoin had a massive breakout Wednesday, briefly crossing $110,000 for the first time in its history. Bitcoin’s prior all-time high was about $108,700; it has since retraced slightly and is trading for $109,639 at time of writing, up 2.6% in the last 24 hours. Next up, the analyst says that Ethereum ( ETH ) will likely need to hold the $2,410 level as support on the six-hour chart to be able to reclaim $3,000 in the near term. “For ETH, it’s approaching the area to hold. If that holds and we’ll find our way up, I think we’ll see $3,000 quite soon.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Ethereum is trading for $2,556 at time of writing, up 1.1% in the last 24 hours.

2025-05-22T16:53:22.000Z,"Best Crypto to Buy Now Before Dogecoin Hits $1.25","The post Best Crypto to Buy Now Before Dogecoin Hits $1.25 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Crypto analyst Kevin identifies Dogecoin as having “one of the nicest charts, if not the nicest altcoin chart in all of altcoins,” with targets of $1.10-$1.25. Dogecoin realized profits soared 225% in 24 hours to $36.1 million as trading volume spiked to $2.71 billion, signaling massive momentum building. Bitcoin Pepe has raised $11m ahead of its imminent May 31st launch, perfectly positioned to capture value as meme coins lead the next altcoin surge. Dogecoin is heating up, with analysts discussing that a rally past the $1 mark is very possible this year. In his latest technical analysis, crypto analyst “Kevin” called DOGE’s current setup a “perfect price structure” and identified it as having one of the strongest charts across all altcoins. “Dogecoin has one of the nicest charts, if not the nicest altcoin chart in all of altcoins,” Kevin told TradingView . “Next to XRP and ETH, Dogecoin got a beautiful chart.” This partly coincides with news that Dogecoin is receiving its first ETF soon, bringing institutional money into meme coins for the first time. #Dogecoin ETF coming soon folks. Prepare yourselves https://t.co/FBDVWBG12J — Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) May 14, 2025 Dogecoin’s latest technical analysis shows Dogecoin displaying the same pattern that led to its moves in previous cycles—clean breakouts, bullish divergences, and higher lows that mirror previous phases of accumulation. According to recent market data, Dogecoin realized profits have surged 225% in just 24 hours, reaching $36.1 million. This massive spike indicates traders are making substantial gains as DOGE builds momentum. Beyond Dogecoin alone, this reflects broader indications that a 2021-style alt season is brewing—and it won’t just be the established alts that benefit. One of the best crypto presales, Bitcoin Pepe , is fast approaching its May 31st launch with an incredible $11m already raised, with its technology aiming to bridge the meme coin sector and its high-frequency trading with Bitcoin in what looks like one of the smartest utility projects of recent times. It’s one of the most exciting presale projects seen in recent times, with smart money securing early prices before it hits exchanges, and there’s still time to join them as the window begins to narrow. History tells us that when established meme coins like DOGE start making serious moves toward $1+ levels, the entire sector benefits—especially projects that solve real problems within the meme coin ecosystem, which Bitcoin Pepe exemplifies. Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP): Launching into perfect market conditions Bitcoin Pepe couldn’t have timed its May 31st launch better. As the world’s first meme-centric ICO on Bitcoin, Bitcoin Pepe is launching right as the meme coin sector is showing explosive strength, with DOGE targeting $1.25 and realized profits soaring across the board. What makes Bitcoin Pepe special isn’t just the meme branding—it’s serious infrastructure bringing “Solana on Bitcoin” through the revolutionary PEP-20 token standard. While other meme coins rely purely on hype and community, Bitcoin Pepe solves Bitcoin’s biggest limitation by enabling thousands of transactions per second on crypto’s most trusted network. The project has already secured strategic partnerships across gaming, DeFi, and content creation, creating a robust ecosystem around its core layer 2 functionality. Even more telling, all of Bitcoin Pepe’s staking pools have completely sold out—a clear signal of overwhelming demand from smart money positioning ahead of the launch. Smart money and prolific traders are preparing for what could be the defining crypto presale of 2025, as the $11 million mark approaches. There’s still time to enter at ground-floor prices, with rumored tier 1 exchange listings set to kick in once the coin launches. When you wake up and see the raise has almost hit $11,000,000!! Buy $BPEP https://t.co/TtbvT3lq5a pic.twitter.com/UtSZs1G0iX — Bitcoin Pepe (@BitcoinPepe_) May 22, 2025 Why Bitcoin Pepe, and why now? Well, crypto projects that solve genuine problems tend to be rare. By allowing anyone to launch memes on Bitcoin, Bitcoin Pepe connects two worlds that once held separate orbits, and therein lies its genius, which could translate to immense value for token holders. Currently at $0.0359, with $11m already raised, the presale window is rapidly closing. With other memes like Dogecoin showing technical strength and an alt season As interest grows, the meme coin sector is primed and ready to explode—especially when Bitcoin Pepe hits exchanges that have the infrastructure to support this growth. For anyone looking to position themselves in the best crypto to buy now before the next meme coin surge, Bitcoin Pepe offers an elusive combination—meme coin appeal fused with serious utility—and could drive sustained adoption beyond just hype cycles. Dogecoin (DOGE): Technical breakout targeting $1.25 From its humble beginnings as a joke cryptocurrency inspired by the popular “doge” meme featuring a Shiba Inu, Dogecoin has come a long way. Created in 2013 by Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, what started as a fun alternative to Bitcoin has evolved into a serious top-5 contender with a $36.3 billion market cap and, for the first time, institutional interest. The numbers tell the story of DOGE’s impressive momentum. Currently trading at $0.2425, Dogecoin has surged 47.90% over the past month, with daily trading volume blasting to $3.23 billion, representing a 61% increase. The rise isn’t just meme hype anymore; it’s legitimate market activity driving sustained price appreciation. Above : Dogecoin’s powerful month to date. Source : CoinMarketCap . What makes this rally particularly interesting is the timing coinciding with Bitcoin dominance dropping from key levels, typically allowing altcoins like Dogecoin to outperform significantly. For investors seeking exposure to established meme coins with proven track records, clear technical targets, and massive community backing, Dogecoin represents one of the best cryptos to buy now before its potential breakout above the psychologically important $1 level. Meme coin season is just getting started Dogecoin has always been a strong yardstick for the meme coin crypto sector and is now displaying the same “perfect price structure” that preceded previous pumps. Meanwhile, the presale success of Bitcoin Pepe, which has raised $11m and is rapidly counting, demonstrates strong institutional interest in meme coin infrastructure plays that provide genuine utility beyond mere community hype. As Kevin noted, “Everything seems to be lining up at the exact right time”—macro conditions, technical setups, and market sentiment are all aligning for what could be an outstanding meme coin season. For investors seeking the best crypto to buy now, the choice is clear: position in quality projects before the breakouts happen. Bitcoin Pepe’s launch into ideal market conditions on May 31st could make it the presale not to miss in 2025. Don’t wait; smart money is already positioning itself, and the window for optimal entry is rapidly closing.View the official website to learn more and get involved.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/information/best-crypto-to-buy-now-before-dogecoin-hits-1-25/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING","Information",cryptocompare

2025-05-22T16:44:53.000Z,"U.K. Court Trims £8.9 Billion Bitcoin SV Claim Against Binance","Binance secured a significant, though partial, courtroom victory this week when Britain’s Court of Appeal struck out the bulk of a £8.9 billion lawsuit tied to the delisting of Bitcoin SV in 2019. The judgment narrowed an investor claim that exchanges conspired to choke the token’s growth by removing trading pairs, effectively slashing potential damages from $11.9 billion to a fraction of that sum. Court rejects speculative losses In a written opinion, judges dismissed the so-called “foregone growth effect,” explaining that “BSV was obviously not a unique cryptocurrency without reasonably similar substitutes.” Plaintiffs had argued Bitcoin SV might have ascended into the digital-asset elite had liquidity remained intact, a scenario the court deemed too hypothetical for restitution. Mitigation duty emphasized Master of the Rolls Sir Geoffrey Vos wrote, “They had a duty to mitigate their losses,” adding, “They cannot recover losses that they could reasonably have mitigated.” The panel found that investors could have sold holdings or rotated into other coins, undercutting claims for windfall damages. ‘Loss of a chance’ theory fails Lawyers for the class tried to revive a “loss of a chance” doctrine, asserting that delisting deprived holders of future price gains. The court labeled the argument “flawed as a matter of principle,” stressing that “cryptocurrencies are, by their nature, volatile investments.” Implications for broader litigation The ruling may influence parallel suits targeting exchange decisions on token listings, reinforcing the idea that damages must be anchored to measurable economic harm. Binance, still facing limited residual claims from investors unaware of the delisting, welcomed the outcome as validation of its strike-out strategy. Separate FTX battle The exchange is also seeking to dismiss a $1.76 billion action brought by the FTX estate, insisting that mismanagement, not external manipulation, doomed the rival platform. With regulatory scrutiny intensifying worldwide, the U.K. decision offers Binance a precedent to cite in future cases involving allegations of market interference. For Bitcoin SV proponents, however, the latest setback highlights the uphill task of proving that missed market opportunities translate into legally recoverable damages. The case now proceeds with a sharply reduced scope, leaving remaining plaintiffs to quantify losses tied directly to the delisting date rather than imagined bull runs. Legal analysts say the judgment underscores the courts’ reluctance to back-stop speculative bets in an asset class famous for double-digit swings. Exchanges, they add, are likely to view the decision as affirmation that listing choices, while consequential, do not guarantee price trajectories. For investors navigating an ever-changing roster of tradable coins, the message is clear: diversification and timely risk management remain paramount. As digital-asset litigation matures, courts appear increasingly unwilling to entertain what one lawyer called “counterfactual moonshots” dressed up as damage claims. Binance’s limited victory may not end its legal headaches, but it sharply limits exposure on one of the more ambitious suits filed against a crypto exchange. The precedent could ripple through the sector, curbing similar claims and nudging market participants toward clearer contractual terms on token availability. For now, Bitcoin SV must seek relevance in the marketplace, not the courtroom.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/u-k-court-trims-8-9-billion-bitcoin-sv-claim-against-binance/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING|BNB","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare

2025-05-22T16:31:22.000Z,"Top US Exchange Says This Could Be the Last Chance to Grab XRP at Current Low Prices: Here’s Why","While XRP holds steady around the $2 mark after Bitcoin has made history, prominent market watchers believe June 2025 could change everything for XRP. According to Martin Hiesboeck, Head of Research at U.S.-based Uphold exchange, the stars may be aligning for XRP's next major breakout or its last calm before the storm.Notably, the optimism relies on three major events scheduled for June. Hiesboeck suggested that the current price range could be the final entry point before another powerful movement. The Uphold exchange itself also shared this sentiment in a follow-up commentary to Hiesboeck's analysis.Spot XRP ETF Decision as a Game-ChangerOne of the most closely watched dates is June 17, when the U.S. SEC could issue a ruling on Franklin Templeton’s spot XRP ETF application . After missing the original May decision window, anticipation has only grown. At least ten XRP ETF applications exist with a final decision timeline in October.Hiesboeck noted that a green light from the SEC could catapult XRP into the mainstream financial ecosystem, much like Bitcoin surged after its ETF approvals in January 2024. While Ethereum’s ETF launch had less impact in mid-2024, proponents argue that XRP's unique utility in cross-border payments and increasing institutional attention could fuel a more dramatic price reaction.Fed’s June Meeting Could Trigger Altcoin SurgeRunning almost in parallel with the ETF decision is the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on June 17–18. Here, traders are watching for potential interest rate cuts. Risk assets like crypto could benefit if the Fed adopts a more dovish policy in response to growing economic stress or global trade tension. Altcoins like XRP often outperform during liquidity-driven rallies, as investors rotate away from large-cap assets like Bitcoin in search of higher upside. Specifically, a rate cut could inject fresh momentum into the altcoin space.XRPL APEX Conference May Reveal Ripple’s Next Big MoveThe third piece of the puzzle is the XRPL APEX, an annual XRP developer summit scheduled for June 10–12 in Singapore. The event will feature Ripple executives and leading builders discussing the future of the XRP Ledger (XRPL). The agenda hints at major updates, including integrations with artificial intelligence, cross-chain interoperability, DeFi, and real-world asset tokenization. According to Hiesboeck, if Ripple delivers any major product launches or partnerships, investor sentiment around XRP could soar, fueling a potential rally.The Window May Be ClosingXRP has already demonstrated its ability to move fast, jumping from $0.50 on U.S. Election Day 2024 to a high of $3.39 within just two months. Since then, it has consolidated between $2 and $2.50. During this time, many traders have been on the sidelines waiting for a clear signal. Meanwhile, Uphold summed it up, saying, \""June could be make-or-break for XRP.\"" As May draws to a close, Uphold suggests market participants may be seeing the final opportunity to acquire XRP at under $3. These three critical catalysts converging in a short span make market watchers believe the incoming month could mark XRP's new breakout point as seen in November 2024.https://twitter.com/UpholdInc/status/1925319693965172883",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/05/22/top-us-exchange-says-this-could-be-the-last-chance-to-grab-xrp-at-current-low-prices-heres-why/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=top-us-exchange-says-this-could-be-the-last-chance-to-grab-xrp-at-current-low-prices-heres-why,"ALTCOIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|XRP","Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction",cryptocompare
2025-05-22T16:30:18.000Z,"Bitcoin Breaks Records as Market Value Hits Historic Peak – Here Are The Key Drivers","The crypto market recently witnessed a historic moment as Bitcoin, the largest digital asset, rallied hard to a new all-time high on Wednesday, triggering renewed optimism in the sector. After the milestone, BTC’s bullish performance has been analyzed and attributed to several key favorable conditions. Triggers Behind Bitcoin’s Sharp Growth Since gaining upward traction in April, the market value of Bitcoin has officially risen to a new all-time high of $111,867, surpassing its previous peak at the $109,241 level achieved during United States President Donald Trump ’s inauguration on January 20. The notable upsurge to a new peak marks a major turning point in the cryptocurrency’s development as a widely recognized financial instrument. However, this spike is being driven by a combination of strong variables rather than speculative hype. According to Santiment, a leading on-chain data platform, this milestone was reached just six weeks after the news of Trump’s tariffs caused the crypto sector to display extreme FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt). This is a clear example that crypto markets have often moved in the opposite direction of institutional whales’ capital and retail expectations. The on-chain platform has also taken a step to outline the key factors that supported the recent rally to a new all-time high. Aside from the tariffs being lowered and the 90-day truce between the US and China , a major factor behind the BTC’s rally highlighted by Santiment has been the increasing number of institutional investors. This heightened institutional interest has been observed among top asset management firms like BlackRock , Fidelity, Ark Invest, and others. Santiment noted that BlackRock’s interest is evidenced by the expansion of its BTC holdings through its Spot Bitcoin ETF , IBIT, which currently breached the $20 billion milestone. During the period, Fidelity and Ark Invest have also reported record inflows. BTC’s notable surge has triggered bullish sentiment in the sector. Due to ongoing tariff uncertainties and widespread jadedness, there has not been much FOMO, therefore, the path was paved for BTC to finally create history. BTC’s Bullish Move Set To Extend To New Highs Over time, Bitcoin has swiftly transformed from a speculative asset to a vital part of diversified investments . This is because of its increasing inclusion in the portfolios of significant asset managers and hedge funds. With the growing presence and crowd’s greed, Santiment is confident that BTC might surge to the $115,000 and $120,000 price range in the near future. Ali Martinez, a crypto analyst and trader, also predicted a continuation of the uptrend, claiming that BTC is entering price discovery. Given the robust performance so far, Martinez believes that the next key levels to watch include $116,000, $126,000, $136,000, and $148,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $110,834, demonstrating a nearly 9% increase in the past week. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that investors are capitalizing on the ongoing upward trend as BTC’s trading volume has risen sharply by more than 73% in the past day.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hits-historic-peak/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Bitcoin News|Ali Martinez|ARK Invest|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|BlackRock|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Coinmarketcap|Donald Trump|Fear Uncertainty and Doubt|Fidelity|fomo|fud|IBIT|Santiment|spot Bitcoin ETF",cryptocompare
2025-05-22T16:25:43.000Z,"Someone Just Paid 1.08 BTC In Fees For A Single Bitcoin Transaction","In a jaw-dropping moment that has sparked widespread discussion across the crypto community, a single Bitcoin user reportedly paid a staggering 1.08 BTC in transaction fees —valued at around $120,358 at current market prices—for just one transfer. The revelation was brought to public attention by well-known crypto commentator Ash Crypto, who shared the astonishing update on X, exclaiming, “THIS IS CRAZY!! SOMEONE JUST PAID 1.08 BTC IN FEES FOR A SINGLE TRANSACTION.” THIS IS CRAZY!! SOMEONE JUST PAID 1.08 BTC IN FEES FOR A SINGLE TRANSACTION pic.twitter.com/QZYLqJYzaJ — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) May 22, 2025 This incident has reignited a crucial conversation about blockchain scalability, fee volatility, and the growing need for low-cost, efficient alternatives, especially at a time when Bitcoin network congestion is once again making headlines. Bitcoin’s Fee Problem Resurfaces Bitcoin , the world’s first and most dominant cryptocurrency, is no stranger to high transaction fees during periods of heightened network activity. The protocol’s reliance on limited block size and its first-come-first-served transaction model often results in fee surges, particularly during bull markets or frenzied trading periods such as NFT mints or BRC-20 activity. In this most recent case, the fee paid was not only exorbitant—it was anomalous. While the average Bitcoin fee has been elevated in recent weeks due to increased on-chain activity, surpassing 1 BTC in fees for a single transaction is exceptional and almost certainly the result of user error or misconfigured wallet software. Still, the implications are sobering: users must remain vigilant, and the broader ecosystem must question whether such inefficiencies are sustainable. XRP Offers a Stark Contrast In light of this news, many in the crypto space are once again highlighting the strengths of alternative blockchain networks, most notably XRP. The XRP Ledger, built for speed, scalability, and cost-efficiency, offers a dramatically different user experience. Transaction fees on the XRPL typically cost a fraction of a cent, often measured in millionths of an XRP, and remain consistent regardless of network load. This reliability in fee structure has always been one of XRP’s most compelling attributes, especially in contexts where microtransactions, remittances, and enterprise-level payment flows are involved. Unlike Bitcoin, which can see fees spike unpredictably, XRP provides a deterministic and affordable cost model that is particularly attractive to businesses and retail users alike. Moreover, XRP’s fee mechanism is deflationary by design: every transaction burns a tiny amount of XRP, reducing the total supply over time. This model not only discourages spam but also aligns the network’s economic incentives with long-term sustainability, something Bitcoin’s fixed block subsidy model may struggle with post-mining reward halving cycles. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Implications for Crypto Adoption and Network Choice The incident highlighted by Ash Crypto is more than just a headline-grabbing anomaly—it’s a reminder of the fundamental differences between blockchain architectures. While Bitcoin remains a powerful store of value and a pioneer in decentralized finance, its limitations as a transactional medium are becoming increasingly clear as fees escalate. XRP, on the other hand, continues to gain traction as a practical tool for real-time, low-cost settlement across borders. With major financial institutions leveraging RippleNet’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution, which uses XRP as a bridge currency, the case for XRP as the go-to option for high-volume and cost-sensitive transactions is only growing stronger. As the crypto market matures, users and enterprises are expected to become more discerning about the networks they engage with. Incidents like this latest 1.08 BTC fee transaction catalyze reevaluating the trade-offs between decentralization, speed, and cost. In that conversation, XRP stands out not just as a viable alternative but as a network purpose-built to avoid exactly the kind of inefficiency that just made headlines. Final Thoughts While the Bitcoin user’s 1.08 BTC fee may possibly have been a mistake, it underscores a systemic issue that continues to affect the usability of the network. With transaction costs that can swing wildly and reach prohibitive levels, Bitcoin’s limitations as a payment solution are once again in the spotlight. XRP, with its ultra-low fees and proven scalability, offers a compelling solution that aligns more closely with the needs of modern digital finance. As crypto adoption accelerates and real-world use cases take precedence over ideological purity, the contrast between networks like Bitcoin and XRP will only become more pronounced—and for many users, that difference will start and end with cost.

2025-05-22T16:24:38.000Z,"Bitcoin sees limited profit taking with BTC price up 3.7%","Bitcoin price remained near its all-time high after a stellar surge on May 21, with bulls largely in control as the market eyed price discovery. After hitting highs of $111,861, Bitcoin ( BTC ) traded to around $110,300 before rebounding higher. Despite the spike to a fresh peak, with Bitcoin outpacing the Dow Jones Industrial Average as stocks struggled , the market hasn’t witnessed a significant profit taking scenario so far. What are analysts saying about Bitcoin price? Notably, all BTC addresses flipped profitable as the cryptocurrency rallied. Yet on-chain data shows the benchmark digital asset is “still not overheated.” CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan posited that despite the run to a new ATH, profit taking is so far mild. “Overheating indicators such as the funding rate [and] short-term capital inflow remain low compared to previous peaks, and profit-taking by short-term investors is limited.” You might also like: Bitcoin reaches new all-time high above $111K as macro tailwinds drive safe-haven demand Alex Wacy, a popular crypto analyst and investor, noted via a post on X that while BTC storms to a new ATH, “there’s no mania.” He pointed to Google searches being low, with retail not yet in fear of missing out territory. https://twitter.com/wacy_time1/status/1925560147578851478 But as Bitcoin quietly edges towards price discovery, something else is at historic levels – the global M2 money supply. Currently, this sits at over $22 trillion. “That means there’s more money in the system than ever before. But it’s not backed by an equivalent increase in productivity, goods, or services. It’s just… more money,” the analyst noted. No frenzy means it’s still early days for Bitcoin, Wacy said. His forecast aligns with overall market sentiment that Bitcoin’s price could target $150k or higher in 2025. On May 21, 2025, as BTC price broke past its January 2025 peak, Michael Saylor said buying at the top could still be profitable long-term . The confidence in Bitcoin price going higher could be why a whale just sold recently acquired Ether ( ETH ) and continues to hodl the BTC.

Traders aren’t the only ones watching—volume, futures interest, and ETF inflows have all climbed significantly in recent sessions. Bitcoin has pushed beyond $111,000, bringing attention back from both retail and institutional sides. While short-term caution remains, the broader structure now hints at a larger move in development, and that could mean new highs ahead. Golden Cross Pattern Strengthens Bitcoin’s Case for $150K+ Bitcoin’s rally isn’t just a reaction to macro relief or ETF inflows—it’s now backed by a textbook bullish formation. The 50-day simple moving average has crossed above the 200-day, forming the widely tracked “golden cross.” This isn’t a rare occurrence, but the context makes it more important than usual. BTC has already reclaimed its highs from earlier in the year, broken through a multi-week resistance zone, and added billions in daily trading volume along the way. The current market is no longer led by just sentiment; data shows a surge in realized cap and futures open interest—suggesting institutions and leveraged traders are deepening their positions. On the chart, the breakout from both a falling wedge and bull flag reinforces the view that this isn’t a fluke—it’s a structured continuation. We have a GOLDEN CROSS 🚀The 50 SMA has crossed the 200 SMA! #bitcoin #btc #goldencross pic.twitter.com/mo4qFdb9Jh — Yannick Maurer (@full_boat) May 22, 2025 Historically, golden crosses have preceded multi-month rallies, with average gains north of 30% in previous cycles. If that plays out again, Bitcoin could see targets around $150,000 materialize quicker than many anticipate. Technical projections from chart patterns support this, and even conservative analysts are adjusting their targets upward. Still, momentum indicators like RSI point to possible near-term pauses. But unless broader support levels crack—particularly near $93,500—any dip may just offer a cheaper entry point. At this stage, Bitcoin looks like it’s gearing up for another leg higher. Best Crypto to Buy Now As A Bull Market May Be In Sight SUBBD SUBBD claims to be actively rethinking how value is distributed in the creator economy. While traditional platforms continue to take large cuts from creators, SUBBD introduces a tokenized model where influence and engagement are directly monetized by the creators themselves. Through its $SUBBD token, the platform enables microtransactions, creator tipping, NFT utility, and gated content access—all without relying on third-party monetization structures. Its infrastructure isn’t just cosmetic. The token integrates with a Web3-native platform offering dashboard tools, subscriber analytics, and community interaction features—similar to what you'd find on Patreon or OnlyFans, but without central control. Smart contracts enforce terms, allowing creators to retain revenue while building stronger fan communities. As interest in decentralized media platforms grows, SUBBD has positioned itself as a frontrunner. With early traction from influencers, crypto content creators, and even indie musicians, its use case is already materializing across multiple verticals. Importantly, it’s not just hype—the tokenomics are carefully designed, with a capped supply, staking rewards for early holders, and plans to burn tokens through platform activity. This gives $SUBBD both functional utility and deflationary potential. The project was dubbed a 100x potential presale by popular creators, including crypto education platform 99Bitcoins . If Bitcoin’s golden cross does trigger a broad market surge, platforms like SUBBD that bring real-world use cases into crypto could gain significant attention. In a market increasingly seeking function alongside speculation, SUBBD offers both. XRP XRP is no longer fighting for relevance as an altcoin—since the start of this year, one thing is clear—it has it. With real-world financial integration already in play, including partnerships with major banks and global payment processors, XRP has matured into one of the top digital assets by market capitalization. The legal clarity following Ripple’s partial court win has only accelerated its integration into cross-border settlements and liquidity hubs. Currently priced at $2.42, XRP is being discussed as a possible $5+ token by the end of the bull cycle. That isn’t just wishful thinking—it’s supported by expanding real-world demand, consistent on-chain volume, and rising institutional exposure. The token has moved beyond hype; its use case in speeding up international settlements and minimizing forex friction is gaining adoption in the very corridors traditional finance once dominated alone. Its inclusion in crypto indexes, strong trading volume on U.S. exchanges post-clarity, and increasing presence in tokenized asset platforms point toward a second wave of growth. With over a hundred institutional partners and Ripple’s global licensing push still underway, XRP may soon benefit from regulatory clarity across multiple jurisdictions. If Bitcoin’s technical indicators are suggesting an oncoming bull market, assets like XRP—already built out, liquid, and adopted—are likely to benefit from renewed capital inflows. While it's not a small-cap gem, the scale of XRP’s reach gives it the ability to deliver outsized gains even from higher starting points. Solaxy Solaxy is rooted in blockchain infrastructure, with a focus on utility, compatibility, and sustained staking rewards. Built as a Layer 2 solution, Solaxy facilitates cross-chain interoperability between Solana and Ethereum, offering fast, affordable transactions with compatibility baked in. The protocol supports staking of its native token, SOLX, at competitive APY rates, but what really drives interest is its vision of decentralized computing and scalable blockchain services. Solaxy is aiming for more than speed—it wants to be the go-to layer for projects needing high throughput without sacrificing smart contract functionality. Its staking mechanism is designed with long-term token health in mind: lock-up periods, real yield from validator rewards, and an allocation structure that prioritizes network security and user incentives. The team has also hinted at deploying wrapped assets, cross-chain liquidity pools, and integrations with NFT and gaming ecosystems in the coming months. For investors watching technical breakouts like Bitcoin’s golden cross and expecting liquidity to rotate into altcoins, Solaxy presents an infrastructure play that doesn’t rely on speculation. It serves a tangible purpose in improving how blockchains communicate, and its positioning across two major chains gives it broad exposure to network effect. As capital starts flowing back into function-driven projects, Solaxy may attract interest from both developers and long-term holders looking for real yield and ecosystem value—not just token appreciation. Best Wallet Token Best Wallet Token isn’t just another utility coin tied to a mobile app—it powers an expanding ecosystem that addresses a real issue in crypto: managing assets across multiple chains without compromising security. Best Wallet, the platform behind the token, is a non-custodial, multi-chain wallet that already supports over 60 blockchains. From EVM-compatible networks to niche ecosystems, it provides seamless access to swaps, staking, and portfolio tracking in one place. The BEST token fits directly into this structure. It provides holders with early access to early-stage projects through the platform’s built-in aggregator, reduced trading fees, and priority access to airdrops and community incentives. Users can also stake BEST directly in-app for high-yield rewards, with rates that often outperform centralized platforms. Beyond convenience, the wallet incorporates privacy-focused features, meaning users retain full control over their keys while still enjoying real-time analytics and insights. It’s designed for mobile-first crypto users who don’t want to bounce between five apps to handle their assets. 🔥 Over $12M Raised and Counting! 🔥Best Wallet is becoming the go-to for traders who want speed, simplicity, and early access to what matters:✅ Buy new tokens early, directly in-app✅ Buy and swap across chains in one place✅ Full portfolio control, no clutterDownload… pic.twitter.com/RDGvIhPLRo — Best Wallet (@BestWalletHQ) May 6, 2025 Best Wallet’s growth is already underway. The app has been downloaded widely since launch, and it’s consistently updated with new features that reflect user demand, such as its iGaming support and cross-chain token discovery tool. If a broad bull market emerges off the back of Bitcoin’s latest signal, tools that simplify access to that market are likely to benefit. Best Wallet Token has the infrastructure, utility, and user base to catch that wave in a sustainable way. Conclusion If Bitcoin’s golden cross is the start of a larger trend, the window to position early may not stay open for long. With liquidity returning and volume spiking, technical setups seem to be aligning across the board, while conditions are shaping up for a broad move across the crypto market. While risks remain, the current structure points toward strength—not exhaustion—making options like the projects mentioned above excellent picks to consider right now.

2025-05-22T16:21:38.000Z,"Bitcoin Pizza Day rally pushes BTC toward $112,000 — how high is Bitcoin going to go?","With Bitcoin Pizza Day pushing BTC past $111,000, are we just getting started? How high is Bitcoin going to go from here in price discovery mode? Table of Contents Why is Bitcoin going up? Bitcoin pizza day brings tonnes of inflows Bitcoin technical analysis How high is Bitcoin going to go? Why is Bitcoin going up? Bitcoin ( BTC ) reached a new all-time high of $111,861 in early trading on May 22. The date also marks Bitcoin Pizza Day , which commemorates the first real-world purchase made with Bitcoin in 2010, when 10,000 BTC were spent on two pizzas. At today’s price, that amount would be worth over $1.1 billion. After the intraday peak, BTC pulled back minutely to around $111,500 at the time of writing, posting nearly 8% gains over the past seven days. The rise came even as U.S. stock markets declined the previous day, reflecting a growing divergence between Bitcoin and traditional equities and breaking the typical correlation seen with indices like the Nasdaq during periods of economic uncertainty. Multiple developments may be fueling the shift. On May 20, the U.S. Senate advanced a bill that lays out a regulatory framework for stablecoins. Although the bill focuses specifically on dollar-pegged digital assets, it marks the first formal move toward broader crypto legislation in the U.S., potentially opening the door to more regulatory clarity across the space. Meanwhile, institutional sentiment has also shifted. On May 19, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon announced during the bank’s annual investor meeting that clients would now be able to purchase Bitcoin through the firm’s platforms. While JPMorgan won’t be directly holding the asset, offering access through its infrastructure marks a key change for one of the world’s largest banks. JPMorgan’s CEO Jamie Dimon reiterated his personal stance, saying, “I’m not a fan of Bitcoin,” but the move clearly responds to rising client interest. Amid this, concerns around the U.S. fiscal outlook may also be playing a role in Bitcoin’s recent rise. Moody’s downgraded the U.S. sovereign credit rating last week, citing long-term debt challenges and policy uncertainty. In response, some investors appear to be turning to Bitcoin as a potential hedge against dollar weakness and broader fiscal instability. Bitcoin pizza day brings tonnes of inflows Over the last three trading sessions through May 21, spot Bitcoin ETFs have collectively brought in over $1.5 billion in inflows, with nearly $1 billion arriving in just the past two days. BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC have led the activity, with IBIT alone pulling in more than $700 million during this period. Single-day inflows included $305.9 million on May 19 and $287.5 million on May 20. Buying activity at these levels indicates that institutions are still entering the market, doing so at relatively high prices, which points to longer-term conviction rather than short-term positioning. At the same time, Bitcoin’s open interest across derivatives markets has reached a new high, totaling over 722,000 BTC, about $80.5 billion in notional value as of May 22. CME continues to be the largest venue for BTC-denominated open interest, holding 164,060 BTC worth $18.14 billion. With a market share of 22.7%, CME’s dominance reflects the scale of institutional involvement in the current rally. Binance and OKX follow with 122,780 BTC and 43,450 BTC in open interest, respectively. Total open interest rose 17.76% over the past 24 hours. Bitget posted the sharpest percentage increase at over 8%, while Binance saw a 9.5% gain, pointing to rising leverage across both institutional and retail trading segments. Higher open interest paired with rising prices generally signals new capital entering long positions. While that can support further upside, it also adds the risk of sharper short-term swings if overleveraged trades start to unwind. In the options market, activity appears to be shifting toward calls, with traders using contracts to express upward price expectations. Call options give buyers the right to purchase Bitcoin at a set price later, signaling a bullish outlook. At the same time, an increase in protective puts could point to hedging behavior, even in the face of strong spot demand. Taken together, the ETF inflows and derivatives positioning suggest confidence among institutional and sophisticated investors. However, the elevated open interest and influx of leverage also mean that the next leg in price could be more reactive to sudden shifts in sentiment or funding conditions. Bitcoin technical analysis Bitcoin’s daily chart reflects a clean breakout structure. Following a prolonged consolidation between January and mid-April, where prices held within a narrow band between $95,000 and $105,000, momentum began building in late April with a steady upward move. Bitcoin price chart | Source: crypto.news A more defined breakout emerged once BTC pushed past the $105,000 resistance, a level that had capped multiple rally attempts since the start of the year. Recent price action has established a clear pattern of higher highs and higher lows, reinforcing the bullish trend. The current leg of the rally began from the April swing low near $73,000. From that level, Bitcoin has gained over 50% in less than two months, climbing with minimal pullbacks and entering a zone of limited historical reference, where price discovery becomes more speculative. The area between $105,000 and $107,000 now serves as the first major support zone. This range acted as resistance during the earlier consolidation and has likely flipped into support following the breakout. A potential retracement into this zone would offer traders a key area to gauge market strength and the likelihood of trend continuation. However, psychological round numbers like $115,000 and $120,000 may act as soft barriers, given how commonly such levels influence behavior in crypto markets. Sustaining a daily close above $112,000 with strong volume could open the way toward the $118,000 to $120,000 zone, where sellers might begin to emerge and trigger partial profit-taking. From a trend perspective, momentum indicators are likely approaching overbought conditions. While that doesn’t imply an immediate reversal, it does highlight the increasingly stretched nature of the move. A deeper pullback would bring the $98,000 to $100,000 region into focus. This zone holds structural importance and could serve as secondary support before any larger move lower. Losing that level might lead to a broader retest of the $92,000 to $95,000 range, where Bitcoin spent considerable time consolidating earlier in the year. For now, the technical structure remains strong, supported by confirmed breakout levels and active participation across both spot and derivatives markets. How high is Bitcoin going to go? Bitcoin’s ongoing rally has now entered a phase of price discovery. With the previous all-time high surpassed, analysts have begun turning to Fibonacci-based projections and key zones to assess where the market could move next. Ali Martinez points to levels such as $116,000, $126,000, $136,000, and $148,000, referencing commonly used expansion points in trend analysis where reactions may emerge as the rally progresses. #Bitcoin $BTC is trading at new all-time highs, entering price discovery. The next key levels to watch are $116,000, $126,000, $136,000, and $148,000! pic.twitter.com/yh3ShJ5X59 — Ali (@ali_charts) May 21, 2025 A broader framework comes from Titan of Crypto, who highlights a fib extension structure targeting $135,000 as a meaningful level for 2025. https://twitter.com/Washigorira/status/1925210331007127609 His chart reflects a sequence of clean breakouts and successful retests, suggesting the current rally is grounded in prior consolidation phases rather than showing signs of exhaustion. Another projection has been offered by Bitcoin Magazine Pro, which places the upper bound of this cycle in the yellow band of the Rainbow Price Chart, estimating a potential target zone between $170,000 and $230,000. https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagPro/status/1925522260137267234 Beyond technicals, Bitcoin’s price movement is also being shaped by macroeconomic factors. The U.S. dollar has continued to weaken, most recently falling to a two-week low after a lackluster response to the Treasury’s 20-year bond auction. This move follows Moody’s downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating and reflects deepening concerns around long-term debt sustainability. Adding to the pressure, the Congressional Budget Office has projected that President Trump’s latest tax and spending proposal could increase the national debt by nearly $3.8 trillion over the next decade. Bond markets are beginning to reflect this unease, with recent auctions drawing tepid demand and volatility rising across rates. Against this backdrop, Bitcoin appears to be benefiting from a shift in capital preference away from dollar-denominated assets. The rally, in part, mirrors changing investor behavior amid growing concerns about fiat stability and long-term fiscal direction. While Bitcoin continues to climb, most altcoins remain subdued. Major tokens are still trailing in both price movement and trading volume, which is typical during the early phase of a Bitcoin-led rally. During such periods, capital tends to concentrate in Bitcoin, especially when the move is viewed through an institutional or macro lens. Only after BTC finds stability and volatility eases does the market tend to rotate into smaller assets. The next chapter for altcoins will depend on two key factors. Sustained stability in Bitcoin’s current range could help rebuild investor confidence and support risk-taking beyond BTC. Equally important are sentiment and liquidity, both of which remain relatively cautious in the altcoin space. Many tokens are still trading below major resistance zones and have not reclaimed previous highs. Until broader capital rotation is confirmed, altcoin momentum remains speculative and lacks clear trend support. As always, approach the market with care, manage exposure wisely, and avoid risking more than you can afford to lose. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

Meet xBTC A token 1:1 backed by Bitcoin and securely held by OKX. xBTC unlocks a new alternative for BTC holders across @Solana , @SuiNetwork , and @Aptos . More to come – watch this space — OKX (@okx) May 22, 2025 Backed 1:1 by BTC held in OKX custody, xBTC allows users to access Bitcoin liquidity within the Aptos ecosystem without paying minting or redemption fees. Starting May 22, users can mint xBTC directly on OKX and transfer it across the Aptos blockchain for use in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, including trading, lending, and Web3 strategies. According to Jason Lau, Chief Innovation Officer at OKX, this integration is part of the company’s broader vision to expand BTC’s utility across on-chain ecosystems. “By bringing xBTC to Aptos, we are keen to see Bitcoin holders put their BTC to work in fast, low-cost DeFi applications,” he said. The move positions Aptos as one of the first high-performance Layer 1 blockchains to natively support xBTC, paving the way for wider adoption of Bitcoin-backed DeFi products. Empowering DeFi Innovation on Aptos The launch of xBTC reflects Aptos’ commitment to unlocking new liquidity pathways and expanding real-world financial use cases for digital assets. “Bitcoin is the linchpin between traditional and decentralized finance markets,” said Ash Pampati, head of ecosystem at the Aptos Foundation, adding that Aptos’ support for xBTC showcases its scalability and developer-friendly architecture. A launch campaign in collaboration with Aries Markets, Hyperion, and Echo Protocol will further drive awareness and user engagement. These integrations are designed to build momentum for deeper use of xBTC across Aptos-native DeFi platforms, providing developers with the tools and confidence to innovate. Increasing Liquidity and Utility for BTC Holders While Bitcoin has long been the dominant crypto asset, its role in DeFi has been limited due to a lack of native smart contract support. With xBTC, Aptos users can now deploy BTC capital across a growing DeFi ecosystem that already boasts over $1 billion in total value locked (TVL). Echo Protocol’s aBTC has already attracted nearly $270 million in TVL, indicating strong demand for wrapped Bitcoin solutions. xBTC stands out for its transparency, leveraging OKX’s public proof-of-reserves platform to provide verifiable backing for each wrapped token. This launch strengthens cross-chain interoperability and positions both OKX and Aptos at the forefront of bringing Bitcoin utility to decentralized finance.

Ives simply referred to them as a “new design movement” that would be similar to Apple’s family of hardware and software integrations. OpenAI has raised billions of dollars from investors, who view the company as a stalwart in the AI industry following the overwhelming success of its ChatGPT large language model (LLM). As of May, ChatGPT had nearly 800 million weekly active users, according to industry data. These usage trends were behind OpenAI’s massive $157 billion valuation as of October 2024 — a figure that nearly doubled to $300 billion by March 2025.ChatGPT usage trends.

However, SOL needs a clear market structure break (MSB) or a decisive bullish breakout above $180 to trigger the next leg of the rally. Declining volumes during the consolidation phase suggest caution, as a lack of buying pressure could stall the breakout. If SOL fails to breach $180, the immediate key area of interest is between $140-150, and the bull flag pattern would be invalidated.

The funding rate was six times higher in Q1 and three times higher in Q4 last year.These low rates indicate minimal speculative activity in the futures market, with the rally driven by spot buyers rather than leveraged traders, reducing the risk of over-leveraged corrections. Such a scenario also indicates that Bitcoin might not have reached a state of euphoria yet. The availability of untapped liquidity in the crypto ecosystem underscores the potential for further growth.

2025-05-22T15:00:00.000Z,"Semiconductor exemptions don’t matter when it comes to tariffs","Opinion by: Ahmad Shadid of O.xyzSemiconductors scored a rare exemption from US President Donald Trump’s aggressive reciprocal tariffs, but the relief is symbolic at best. Most semiconductors enter the US embedded in servers, GPUs, laptops, and smartphones. The finished goods remain heavily tariffed, some with duties reaching up to 49%. The exemption looks good politically but delivers little practical benefit. Nvidia’s DGX systems, crucial for training advanced AI models, do not fall under the exempted HTS codes. Nvidia could pay effective tariffs nearing 40% on these vital components. Such costs threaten to stall critical AI infrastructure projects across the country. Semiconductor tariffs may compromise the goal of the CHIPS Act. The act promised tens of billions of dollars in subsidies to support domestic chip manufacturing. Yet advanced lithography machines — key equipment from countries like the Netherlands and Japan — face 20%–24% tariffs. Ironically, tariffs designed to boost American production increase the cost of essential manufacturing equipment.The effect of new tariffs is already slowing progress in critical supply chains — just as generative AI and large language models are gaining momentum across sectors like finance and defense. Any delays or cost increases now could blunt America’s technological advantage.Indirect costs undermine exemptions for AIModern semiconductor supply chains are global and highly integrated. An exemption on raw silicon means nothing when servers, GPUs and other finished products face steep tariffs. Tariffs indirectly inflate costs, eliminating any competitive advantage from domestic manufacturing.Indirect tariff costs hit high-end systems disproportionately hard. The effect ripples through AI model training, data center expansions and major infrastructure projects, significantly slowing the industry’s momentum.Tariff impasse halts investmentSo far, it’s clear that the US president’s tariff plan didn’t follow any conventional economic trends or calculated strategy. The uncertain tariff situation stalls investment decisions across the technology sector. Companies need predictable costs to justify large capital expenditures. Ongoing tariff volatility prevents them from committing resources to new data centers and manufacturing lines.This mirrors the supply chain chaos of 2020. At that time, uncertainty caused massive order cancellations and slowed industry recovery for years. If tariff ambiguity continues, we could see similar waves of cancellations in 2025. This would further compound existing inventory and revenue issues in the semiconductor sector.Domestic production is not optimalThe border argument for these tariffs is that they’re meant to boost domestic production. They do little, however, to encourage genuine domestic semiconductor production. Despite subsidies under the CHIPS Act, most US semiconductor companies still rely on international foundries for manufacturing. Instead, they face increased equipment and operational costs.Recent: How trade wars impact stocks and cryptoThe idea that tariffs promote domestic production ignores the reality of global semiconductor manufacturing. Costs rise across the board, putting American companies at a disadvantage rather than offering protection.AI projects face heightened riskThe blockchain and crypto sectors, particularly AI-driven projects, also feel the pinch. Projects depend heavily on GPUs and high-performance servers for mining, validating transactions and running decentralized AI computations. Increased hardware costs directly affect profitability and growth, potentially stalling innovation in blockchain applications. AI developments have just started to pick up the pace in the blockchain and Web3 space. The industry saw increased interest from investors and VCs just a year ago. So, they are still on tighter budgets. Elevated costs can, however, lead to stagnation. We might see innovators and developers exiting the market. The ripple effect extends beyond the general technology sector and could threaten future digital economies. Moreover, these cost pressures disproportionately affect startups and smaller tech firms. Industry giants can absorb additional expenses, but innovative, smaller players face existential threats. This dynamic risks stifling innovation at the grassroots level, harming the entire tech ecosystem.What to expect Semiconductors have momentarily escaped direct tariffs, but the exemption provides little benefit. Tariffs continue to hit finished products, driving up indirect costs across the industry. Instead of boosting domestic manufacturing, these tariffs create economic paralysis, stall critical infrastructure projects, and threaten America’s lead in AI innovation. Policymakers must acknowledge these realities and adjust their approach before irreversible damage is done to the nation’s technological future.Opinion by: Ahmad Shadid of O.xyz.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-22T13:30:00.000Z,"How staking incentivizes trust without burning energy","What if a financial system could run itself not by burning electricity, but by rewarding good behavior? That’s the promise of staking, a mechanism that powers many modern blockchains by turning users into network operators. In this week’s episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Gareth Jenkinson and Nathan Jeffay sit down with StarkWare’s Noam Nisan to unpack how this trustless engine works, why it matters and what’s really at stake.Understanding stakingJeffay began by highlighting how staking is part of the backbone that keeps the blockchain running, and runs itself, with volunteers.“By doing this, they’re saying, OK, we’re taking this task of running the blockchain seriously. Here's some of our money. We're putting it down. We're showing that we're serious about doing this.”To help unpack this topic further and examine the deeper mechanics behind staking, the hosts are joined by Noam Nisan, principal researcher at StarkWare and a widely respected computer scientist who has held roles at Google and Princeton.Related: How to handle crypto trading gains and losses on your balance sheet“So we have this general system with operators... Why would they want to do that? The system, the protocol, incentivizes them to actually run the system,” Nisan explained. “Basically, it can give them tokens for operating the system.”Staking offers what Nisan describes as two distinct types of security: computer science-based guarantees and economic disincentives for bad actors. “If a majority or supermajority, maybe two-thirds of the parties of the token of the staked amount are behaving properly... we can prove that the system acts correctly,” he said. “But you also have what I would call an economic guarantee... if they destroy the system, very likely the value of the token... will go down. So they are the one losing.”PoW vs PoSJenkinson, a vocal Bitcoin (BTC) supporter, posed the classic comparison: proof-of-work vs proof-of-stake. “Do you have any strong feelings about one or the other?” he asked.“The truth is that it’s not clear.. it's really a social question, I think.”Nisan noted that both mechanisms involve trade-offs around cost, control, and decentralization. The episode also explores the role of staking in tokenomics and system design. Nisan unpacks how fee mechanics and inflation controls, such as Ethereum’s minting curve, help keep the ecosystem in balance.To hear the full conversation on The Clear Crypto Podcast,  listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

2025-05-22T12:38:44.000Z,"UK court partially dismisses Bitcoin SV investor’s lawsuit against Binance","The United Kingdom’s Court of Appeal has partially dismissed a lawsuit brought by Bitcoin SV investors against major crypto exchanges, including Binance, for allegedly conspiring to delist the token in 2019.In a judgment handed down on May 21, the court ruled that investors who held BSV through the delisting period (classified as “sub-class B”) were not entitled to billions in speculative damages based on BSV’s hypothetical growth.These investors had claimed over 8.9 billion British pounds ($11.9 billion) in damages, asserting that Binance’s delisting deprived holders of the chance to profit from BSV’s potential rise to a “top-tier cryptocurrency” like Bitcoin (BTC) or Bitcoin Cash (BCH).The court rejected this “foregone growth effect” theory, stating, “BSV was obviously not a unique cryptocurrency without reasonably similar substitutes,” pointing to the representative’s own use of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash as comparators.Sub-class B’s central claim was that delisting led to a missed opportunity to benefit from price appreciation. However, the court determined that those investors had ample chance to mitigate losses by selling or reinvesting in other crypto assets.“They had a duty to mitigate their losses,” wrote Master of the Rolls Sir Geoffrey Vos. “They cannot recover losses that they could reasonably have mitigated.”UK court ruling against Bitcoin SV investor’s lawsuit. Source: CaselawRelated: Bitcoin SV investors attempt to resurrect 2019 Binance lawsuitCourt strikes down “loss of a chance” argumentThe appeal also challenged the Tribunal’s application of the “market mitigation rule,” arguing that such issues should be left for trial.The court dismissed that notion, stating the rule clearly applies to freely tradable assets like BSV, and that the damages must be measured shortly after the delisting.An additional argument concerning the “loss of a chance” to benefit from future price gains was also struck down. The court ruled it “flawed as a matter of principle,” noting that “cryptocurrencies are, by their nature, volatile investments.”Binance’s limited strike-out application ultimately succeeded, with the court stating that even if some holders were unaware of the delisting, “they could never claim more than the total value of their holding before the delisting events plus any quantifiable consequential losses.”Related: Binance wants arbitration for all members of securities class suitBinance seeks to dismiss FTX lawsuitOn May 16, Binance filed a motion to dismiss a $1.76 billion lawsuit filed by the FTX estate, arguing that the claims are legally flawed and an attempt to shift responsibility for FTX’s collapse.The exchange stated the downfall of FTX stemmed from internal fraud, not external manipulation, citing Sam Bankman-Fried’s conviction on multiple fraud charges.Binance has asked the court to dismiss all claims with prejudice.

2025-05-22T10:21:18.000Z,"Can ChatGPT-powered AI agents really trade crypto for you?","Key takeawaysChatGPT-powered AI agents automate trading tasks using natural language prompts and API integrations, improving speed and consistency.Successes occur when ChatGPT is used as a support tool, not a fully autonomous trading system.Failures happen when traders over-rely on ChatGPT without real-time data, proper risk management or manual oversight.Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance.What if a crypto trader didn’t need to constantly check charts, worry about emotions, or stay up all night watching for sudden price swings? What if those tasks could be handled by an intelligent agent that understands instructions in plain English — and reacts within milliseconds? That’s where ChatGPT-powered AI agents come in.These tools combine natural language processing with real-time trading logic to automate decision-making in one of the world’s most volatile markets. From rebalancing portfolios to reacting to market sentiment, ChatGPT is being adapted to act as a trading assistant, risk manager and market analyst — all rolled into one. But can it truly match or even outperform human intuition? This article explores how far these agents have come, where they shine and where they still fall short.How ChatGPT-powered AI agents operate in cryptocurrency marketsChatGPT-powered AI agents are changing how people interact with crypto markets. These tools combine ChatGPT’s language abilities with external trading tools and APIs to help users monitor prices, understand trends and even place trades automatically. Instead of just reacting to charts or numbers, ChatGPT can understand plain language commands like “Buy Ethereum if the price drops below $2,000” or “Sell Bitcoin if RSI goes above 70.”These AI trading assistants can work with major platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, OKX and other centralized or decentralized exchanges and can also tap into decentralized finance (DeFi) tools and smart contracts. With the right setup, ChatGPT can help automate trading strategies based on both technical data and market news.Success stories vs. failures in ChatGPT-powered crypto tradingSome traders have used ChatGPT to assist in automating parts of their crypto trading processes, particularly for strategy generation and sentiment analysis. For example, a user shared on Reddit that they used a ChatGPT-based AI agent for technical analysis on Ether (ETH), feeding it four-hour and daily chart screenshots. By interpreting market sentiment, support and resistance zones, and other indicators, they managed to make $6,500 in profits.Similarly, in the broader crypto sector, ChatGPT has been applied to support project development activities such as drafting white papers and marketing content. A notable example is the launch of the “TURBO” memecoin, which reportedly reached a market capitalization of over $50 million in 2024. In this case, ChatGPT was used to streamline documentation and communication rather than manage trading activity, illustrating its usefulness as a support tool in crypto-related initiatives.However, limitations are evident when ChatGPT is applied beyond its core design. While ChatGPT could suggest a trading portfolio and explain its reasoning clearly, it lacks access to real-time market data and couldn’t respond to sudden volatility. In one instance, ChatGPT was allocated $100 across multiple tokens but failed to actively manage the portfolio as prices fluctuated. This resulted in missed opportunities and underperformance compared to dynamic algorithmic strategies.Individual experiences reinforce these observations. A Redditor exposed a scam where a YouTuber promoted a “ChatGPT trading bot” tutorial that led users to deploy malicious smart contracts. The contracts, generated using ChatGPT and passed off as safe, were designed to drain user wallets once funded. Victims collectively lost $17,240 in ETH, highlighting the danger of blindly trusting AI-generated code without proper auditing.Even when asked, “If I use ChatGPT to build an AI agent for crypto trading, can I become a millionaire?” ChatGPT responded with a realistic outlook — acknowledging that while it’s possible, success depends on having a profitable strategy, disciplined risk management, and the ability to scale effectively.Here is ChatGPT’s response:These cases suggest that while ChatGPT can support certain elements of the trading process, it should not be treated as a standalone solution for autonomous crypto trading.AI in crypto trading: Key benefits and limitationsAI tools like ChatGPT are increasingly being integrated into crypto trading workflows to improve speed, accuracy and efficiency. While they offer important advantages, they also carry specific limitations that traders must actively manage. Below are the main benefits and challenges:Key benefits of using AI for crypto tradingAI bots can execute trades in milliseconds, crucial for capturing opportunities in fast-moving crypto markets.Bots follow pre-programmed rules precisely, eliminating emotional biases that often affect human traders.Crypto markets are always open, and AI bots can monitor and act around the clock without interruption.A single bot can manage multiple trading pairs, exchanges and strategies simultaneously.ChatGPT can understand specific prompts like “Rebalance every Monday” or “Set stop-loss at 5%,” allowing flexible automation.Limitations of ChatGPT in cryptocurrency tradingChatGPT does not access live market data unless specifically integrated with external APIs (e.g., TradingView, CoinMarketCap or exchange websockets).Instructions must be clear and unambiguous; ChatGPT may misinterpret vague or complex commands.Improperly secured API keys or lack of two-factor authentication (2FA) can expose trading accounts to unauthorized access.ChatGPT’s cloud-based infrastructure can introduce latency, which could impact performance during highly volatile periods.ChatGPT does not monitor regional compliance rules; users must manually enforce trading limits based on local regulations.Ethical and regulatory implications of AI in crypto tradingAs AI becomes more integrated into trading systems, it raises significant ethical and regulatory concerns that stakeholders across the financial sector are beginning to address.Accountability: If an AI agent executes a harmful or unlawful trade, questions arise around legal responsibility. It remains unclear in many jurisdictions whether liability falls primarily on the developer, the trader using the AI system or the platform facilitating the transactions.Market manipulation risks: Autonomous AI bots could unintentionally engage in activities such as spoofing (placing and canceling fake orders to mislead the market) or wash trading (creating artificial volume), especially if not properly programmed with compliance safeguards.Regulatory oversight: Financial authorities, including the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the European Securities and Markets Authority, are actively studying the implications of AI and algorithmic trading. These agencies have recognized that traditional trading regulations may not fully account for autonomous decision-making by AI systems.Policy developments: In January 2024, the European Commission released updates to its Digital Finance Strategy, which included references to AI-based financial services. While not yet finalized, these draft regulations under the broader Digital Finance Package signal a move toward stricter compliance expectations for firms deploying AI in financial markets.Meanwhile, ethical crypto platforms are beginning to voluntarily disclose the use of trading bots in their systems. In parallel, open-source communities are advocating for clearer audit trails, improved model transparency and the establishment of ethical guidelines for AI applications in finance to ensure accountability and fairness.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-22T08:37:57.000Z,"Dubai regulator clarifies real-world asset tokenization rules: Lawyer","Newly updated guidelines from Dubai’s crypto regulator include provisions on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and clarify rules for issuers. On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) released its updated Rulebook for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) operating in the region. The regulator gave market participants until June 19 to comply with the new rules. The regulator previously told Cointelegraph that it had enhanced supervisory mechanisms and brought consistency across activity-based rules. One of the more prominent changes includes regulatory clarity on RWA tokens. Irina Heaver, partner at the United Arab Emirates-based law firm NeosLegal, told Cointelegraph that the updated rules clarify RWA issuance and distribution. “Issuing real-world asset tokens and listing them on secondary markets is no longer theoretical,” Heaver told Cointelegraph. “It’s now a regulatory reality in Dubai and the broader UAE.”A “viable” path to realize RWA hypeHeaver compared RWAs to security token offerings (STOs), an earlier attempt from the crypto space to tokenize securities like stocks, bonds and real estate investment trusts. However, the UAE crypto lawyer said that STOs “died a peaceful death in 2018 to 2019.” The lawyer told Cointelegraph STOs did not work out because of the lack of regulatory clarity, viable secondary market trading venues, institutional investor appetite and liquidity. Still, the situation is different for RWAs. Heaver told Cointelegraph that RWAs are the next foundational layer for institutional adoption of blockchain and virtual assets. Heaver said that VARA’s new rules already cover them as Asset-Referenced Virtual Assets (ARVA) tokens. She said: “VARA’s newly updated Virtual Asset Issuance Rulebook (May 2025) addresses these failures head-on. Regulated exchanges and broker-dealers in Dubai are now authorized to distribute and list ARVA tokens.”The lawyer said this solves an issue in jurisdictions like Switzerland, where token issuance is possible, but listing and secondary trading remain unregulated. Related: Dubai gov’t agencies to link real estate registry with property tokenizationLawyer shares requirements for RWA issuersHeaver said ARVA tokens are defined under Dubai law as representing direct or indirect ownership of real-world assets, granting entitlement to receive or share income and purporting to maintain a stable value by reference to real-world assets or income. ARVA tokens are also backed or collateralised by such real-world assets or constitute a derivative, wrapped, duplicated, or fractionalised version of another ARVA. The lawyer said issuers must meet specific requirements, including a Category 1 Virtual Asset Issuance license, a comprehensive white paper and a risk disclosure statement. In addition, issuers must have a paid-up capital of 1.5 million UAE dirhams (about $408,000) or 2% of reserve assets held. The issuers are also subjected to monthly independent audit obligations and must adhere to ongoing supervisory oversight. “VARA is providing regulatory clarity, and it’s giving the industry a viable, enforceable path to turn the hype of RWA tokenization into reality,” Heaver told Cointelegraph. “This matters because it marks a shift, from theory to execution, from fiction to framework.”Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/dubai-vara-guidelines-rwa-tokenization-clarity?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-22T08:25:00.000Z,"5 red flags you’re being shilled: Don’t buy the hype","What is shilling in crypto?              At its core, shilling is the act of artificially promoting a cryptocurrency or token, often with exaggerated claims, to increase its price or popularity. But what’s the goal? Hype it up, get others to buy in, and then cash out, leaving latecomers holding the bag.Shilling can come from anyone: influencers, anonymous accounts or even high-profile figures with political or financial clout. The common thread is manipulation: It’s not about educating you or building real value but pumping hype for personal gain.Unfortunately, the line between enthusiastic promotion and outright deception can be thin, and many fall victim without realizing it. That’s why it’s critical to learn how to spot the signs early.                  5 red flags you’re being shilled              Beware of crypto red flags like overhyped promises, anonymous teams, influencer shills, missing products and FOMO tactics — if it smells like a scam, it probably is.1. Overhyped promises You’ve probably seen posts that scream:“100x potential!”“Guaranteed returns!”“This is your ticket to financial freedom!”These are classic shill tactics. Real, credible projects don’t promise life-changing profits. Why? Because there are no guarantees in crypto or in any investment.When a project leads with grandiose financial claims rather than actual product value or utility, it’s likely a ploy to stir FOMO and attract unsuspecting investors. The truth is, if something sounds too good to be true, it almost always is.Remember: The bigger the promise, the bigger the red flag.2. Anonymous or suspicious teams In crypto, anonymity isn’t always bad, but when you’re trusting people with your money, transparency matters.It’s a major red flag when a project has:No identifiable team membersFake names or aliasesStock photos on its websiteNo LinkedIn or professional history.The simple rule is “No face, no funds.”Scammers often hide behind anonymity because they know they’ll eventually vanish and there’ll be no one to hold accountable. Even worse, some use fabricated credentials or hire actors to pose as team members.Before investing, check whether the founders or developers have any verifiable history. Do they have prior experience in blockchain or startups? Have they launched anything successful before?3. Influencer spam and paid promotions One day, no one’s talking about a particular coin — the next, your feed is flooded with influencers hyping it up. Sound familiar?This sudden burst of attention is often coordinated with a paid promotion campaign disguised as “genuine enthusiasm.”Many influencers fail to disclose sponsorships, even though it’s required by law in many countries. The US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have cracked down on this in recent years.Take, for example:Kim Kardashian, who was fined $1.26 million in 2022 for promoting EthereumMax without proper disclosure.Floyd Mayweather Jr., who was sued for endorsing the same project at a paid event.BitBoy (Ben Armstrong), who faced legal action in multiple lawsuits for promoting scam tokens to his audience.If you notice multiple influencers promoting the same project in a short time, especially without using labels like #ad or #sponsored, it’s a strong indicator of a shill campaign.Don’t mistake volume for value. Hype doesn’t equal legitimacy.4. No real product or roadmapIf you visit the project’s website, it looks sleek, maybe even impressive. But where’s the product? Where’s the code?Shilled tokens often rely on flashy marketing but have no working application, no GitHub code and no actual use case. Everything is either “coming soon” or buried behind vague promises.Ask yourself:Can I use the platform or app today?Is there a white paper that makes sense?Do they have public repositories or open development?If all you’re seeing is a landing page and a vague roadmap that’s been “coming soon” for months, that’s a major red flag.5. Pressure tactics and FOMO Time pressure is a psychological weapon, and shillers know how to use it.Watch out for lines such as:“Presale ends in 2 hours!”“Only 1,000 spots left!”“If you don’t buy now, you’ll miss out forever!”These tactics prey on your fear of missing out (FOMO) and push you into making impulsive decisions without research.But crypto isn’t a sprint; it’s a long-term game. Anyone trying to rush you into buying likely has something to hide. Solid investments don’t need fake urgency.Take a breath, step back, and ask yourself: Am I buying because I believe in this project or because I’m being manipulated?Did you know? The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) secured a $128-million judgment against Ryan Mitchell Pope, Daniel Samuel Bishop and their company EmpiresX for operating a fraudulent forex and cryptocurrency investment scheme that defrauded over 12,500 victims.                  Is shilling illegal in crypto? Can influencers be sued?              Shilling isn’t just unethical in many cases — it’s also illegal.In the world of crypto, undisclosed promotions are a major legal risk. If someone is paid to promote a token or project but fails to reveal that financial connection, they could face fines, lawsuits or even criminal charges. This is especially true if the promoted token is later classified as a security under US law.Regulators like the SEC, FTC and CFTC have all cracked down on this behavior. Their targets have included:Influencers who failed to disclose paid promotionsPromoters who misled investors with false claimsIndividuals who ran pump-and-dump schemes using social media.Francier Obando Pinillo, a pastor from Miami, was indicted on 26 fraud counts for running a crypto scam through “Solano Fi,” defrauding investors of millions from 2021 to 2023. He allegedly used his church, social media and false promises of 34.9% monthly returns to lure victims. The platform showed fake gains but blocked withdrawals, while funds were diverted for personal use. Pinillo was arraigned in Richland, Washington and faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.As crypto becomes more mainstream, expect stricter regulations and more consequences for shillers.Did you know? Argentine President Javier Milei has dissolved the special task force investigating the LIBRA cryptocurrency scandal, a project he promoted in February 2025 that surged to a $4.5-billion valuation before crashing by over 97%. The task force, created by Milei himself, was disbanded via Decree 332/2025, citing that it had fulfilled its purpose. However, critics argue that no official findings were released, and judicial investigations into Milei and his associates continue.                  How to protect yourself from shilling scams              Do your own research, verify the team and utility, ignore hype and influencers, and stay alert to pump-and-dump schemes to avoid crypto shilling traps.Let’s understand how you can protect yourself from shilling scams in crypto:Do your own research (DYOR): Always research the project, the team behind it and the data supporting the claims. Don’t rely solely on hype or influencer recommendations. Look into onchain data, GitHub activity and the project’s utility to make informed decisions.Verify the team: A legitimate crypto project should have a transparent and credible team. If the developers are anonymous or have no professional profiles (like LinkedIn), that’s a red flag. Always check the team’s past projects and credibility before investing.Look for real utility: Does this project actually solve a problem? A genuine project should have a working product or solution, not just promises. Avoid projects that lack real-world utility or are still in “coming soon” stages for extended periods.Ignore the hype: If a token is suddenly trending on social media or being aggressively promoted, don’t let FOMO influence your judgment. Shillers often rely on emotions to push their agenda, so it’s essential to evaluate projects based on their merits, not just popularity.Stay skeptical of influencers: Influencers with large followings may be paid to promote certain tokens. Before taking their advice, ask yourself, What’s their incentive? Verify the promotion is legitimate and disclosed as paid or sponsored. Always cross-check the information with independent sources.Watch for pump-and-dump schemes: Be cautious of sudden price spikes followed by rapid drops. These are often signs of pump-and-dump schemes where the token’s value is artificially inflated by coordinated buying and then quickly sold off, leaving investors with losses. Always monitor price trends and be wary of sudden, unexplained increases in value.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/5-red-flags-youre-being-shilled-dont-buy-the-hype?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Seeker is the company’s second-generation device, after the Saga Web3 phone that launched in April 2023. The company unveiled the Seeker phone in September 2024, saying it wouldn’t just be a “memecoin phone.” So far, it has pre-sold 150,000 units.The Solana Seeker has gone through two sale phases: The Founder window, where the price for each device was $450, and the Early Adopter window, where the price per device was $500. Assuming the lower price window, Solana Mobile could generate at least $67.5 million in gross revenue from device sales. For comparison, the iPhone generated $199.3 billion in revenue for Apple in 2024.The new architecture that will govern future Solana Mobile devices is called TEEPIN, which stands for “Trusted Execution Environment Platform Infrastructure Network.” It is a three-layer architecture — hardware, platform, and network layers — that will allow users, developers, and device makers to participate in a trustless environment.Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder and CEO of Solana Labs, called TEEPIN “the next evolution in mobile” and a framework where trust is “verified by cryptography.”In addition, Solana Mobile is planning to launch “SKR,” the native asset of the Solana Mobile ecosystem. \""It transforms the traditional mobile business model by giving stakeholders actual ownership in the platform,” said Emmett Hollyer, general manager at Solana Mobile.

This data supports the idea that derivatives markets were not the main driver of the recent price increases. Moreover, the $1.37 billion in net inflows to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States between May 15 and May 20 further suggests that spot buyers, rather than derivatives traders, were the primary force behind the rally.Despite the lack of conviction in Bitcoin futures, several indicators point to further upside. Forced liquidations of bearish BTC futures positions were relatively low at $170 million between May 18 and May 21, cementing the idea of a spot-driven rally.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) in the overbought zone indicate that the bulls are in control.

A break below the 20-day EMA will be the first sign that the bulls are booking profits in a hurry.

The ETH/USDT pair is likely to pick up momentum on a break above $2,739. That clears the path for a rally to $3,000.Contrary to this assumption, a break and close below the 20-day EMA signals that the bears are back in the game. The pair could tumble to $2,111, which is likely to attract solid buying by the bulls.XRP price predictionXRP (XRP) has been witnessing a tough battle between the buyers and sellers at the 20-day EMA ($2.35).XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. If the price skids below the 20-day EMA, the XRP/USDT pair may stay inside the $2 to $2.65 range for a while. Instead, if the price turns up sharply from the 20-day EMA and breaks above $2.65, the advantage will tilt in favor of the bulls. The pair could rally to $3 and, after that, to $3.40, where the sellers are expected to mount a strong defense.BNB price predictionBNB (BNB) bulls have held the 20-day EMA ($639) support during the pullback, indicating buying on dips. BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bulls will try to push the price above $693 but are expected to face solid selling by the bears.

If they can pull it off, the SOL/USDT pair could accelerate toward the target objective of $210 and then $220.If sellers want to prevent the upside, they will have to quickly tug the price below the 20-day EMA. The pair could slide to $153 and later to the 50-day SMA ($145).

2025-05-21T17:55:00.000Z,"Interest groups, lawmakers to protest Trump&#039;s memecoin dinner","Democratic leaning organizations and members of Congress have announced plans to protest what they describe as the sale of access to the office of the US president, in reference to Donald Trump’s memecoin dinner on May 22. The event’s attendees are said to have collectively spent over $100 million for the chance to meet with the US president.Since Trump’s memecoin project, Official Trump (TRUMP), announced that its top 220 tokenholders would have an opportunity to apply for an exclusive dinner with the president, many leaders in the crypto industry and US lawmakers have criticized the event, saying Trump was opening his office to potential bribery and corruption. The memecoin dinner prompted some Democratic lawmakers to withdraw support for crypto-related legislation in Congress, including the market structure and stablecoin bills.“Trump collecting gifts from foreign governments is unconstitutional,” a spokesperson for the consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen, which is planning to protest near the memecoin dinner on May 22, told Cointelegraph. “Collecting foreign government investments through his memecoin is not much better. American foreign policy should not be for sale.”Source: Public CitizenCrypto industry figures such as Tron founder Justin Sun, Kronos Research chief investment officer Vincent Liu, Hyperithm co-CEO Oh Sangrok, and Synthetix founder Kain Warwick are among the tokenholders expected to attend the dinner at the Trump National Golf Club outside Washington, DC. The memecoin project said all applicants had to pass a background check and could not be from a “[Know Your Customer] watchlist country.”Related: Democrats seek suspicious activity reports linked to Trump crypto venturesPublic Citizen, in partnership with progressive political organization Our Revolution, will hold a rally near the golf club, which Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley is expected to attend. In addition, the Arlington and Loudoun Democrats will be hosting a separate event to urge US officials to “hold [Trump] accountable,” and Democratic leadership in Congress has scheduled two press events on May 22 ahead of the dinner.“Americans cannot and will not accept President Trump’s view that positions of power exist only to benefit the holder of that power,” Ryan Ruzic, chair of the Loudoun County Democratic Committee, told Cointelegraph. “We have a moral responsibility to speak out against corruption, whatever the result may be.”Pushback on TRUMP memecoin affected crypto legislationSome lawmakers initially cited the memecoin dinner and the Trump family’s involvement with the crypto platform World Liberty Financial in opposing passage of the GENIUS Act, a bill to regulate payment stablecoins. World Liberty Financial began issuing its own USD1 stablecoin in March, prompting concerns about Trump’s conflicts of interest. However, the legislation passed a key procedural vote in the Senate on May 19 with support from Democrats, setting the bill up for debate in the chamber.“Many senators, myself included, have very real concerns about the Trump family’s use of crypto technologies to evade oversight, hide shady financial dealings, and personally profit at the expense of everyday Americans,” said Sen. Mark Warner in a statement before the May 19 vote, adding: “But we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay.”Senator Chris Murphy, who voted against advancing the GENIUS Act, called for bipartisan support in amending the bill to specifically bar a US president from issuing stablecoins. He also called on the White House to release a complete list of attendees to the memecoin dinner, suggesting that some or all of them would “try to get something from the president” in exchange for purchasing the tokens. Murphy and Senator Elizabeth Warren will attend a press event with representatives for Public Citizen on May 22. California Representative Maxine Waters, ranking member of the US House Financial Services Committee, announced a separate press conference for the same day, with plans to introduce a bill to “block Trump’s memecoin and stop his crypto corruption, once and for all.”As of May 21, the exact number of attendees to the dinner was unknown. A smaller group of 25 tokenholders also qualified to apply for “VIP tour” and reception — presumably at the White House — with Trump, but the complete list of those planning to attend was also unknown at the time of publication.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/protest-donald-trump-memecoin-dinner?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

For many, this could be the long-awaited climax of the past four years, and major players are preparing accordingly.Since late 2024, Bitcoin whale accumulation has surged. Glassnode data shows that the number of addresses holding over 100 BTC has jumped by almost 14%, reaching 18,200 — a level not seen since 2017. The biggest market players appear to be positioning for what could be this cycle’s final run-up.Number of BTC addresses holding over 100 BTC. Source: GlassnodeHowever, riding the rally is trickier than it looks and knowing when to exit is notoriously difficult. The lure of higher price highs fuels FOMO, driving investors to buy the top, only to face painful drawdowns or even liquidations.So, how can traders and investors spot the top before the market enters recession?Bitcoin cycle top markersSeveral technical and onchain indicators, such as MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Z-score, Pi Cycle Top, and trading volume trends, have historically been reliable in signaling when Bitcoin is nearing its peak.The MVRV-Z score compares Bitcoin’s market value to its realized value and adjusts for volatility. A high Z-score suggests Bitcoin is significantly overvalued relative to its historical cost basis. When this indicator is at a historical high, the ensuing downward trend in Bitcoin prices is likely.The Pi Cycle Top tracks BTC price dynamics using moving averages. When the 111-day moving average (111-SMA) crosses above twice the 350-day average (350-SMAx2), it signals overheating. In other words, when the short-term trend catches up to the long-term trajectory, a market top is in.Historically, all previous Bitcoin bull runs started with a notable surge in MVRV Z-score, and ended with 111-SMA crossing the longer-term trend.BTC: Pi Cycle Top + MVRV Z-score. Source: Marie Poteriaieva, GlassnodeAdditionally, lower trading volumes during price increases can be a warning sign, often signaling weakening momentum and potential for a reversal. On-balance volume (OBV), which registers cumulative volume flow, is a valuable metric for tracking this process. When OBV diverges from the price action, it is often an early reversal signal. The second leg of the 2021 bull run was a great example. While BTC price was hitting higher highs of $68,000 (compared to the previous all-time high of $63,170), trading volumes moved in a different direction, decreasing from 710,000 BTC to 628,000 BTC. This created a bearish divergence between price and volume, suggesting that fewer market participants were supporting the rally — a classic sign of waning momentum.BTC/USD 1-day, OBV.

Some valuable metrics that can track it are the Puell Multiple and exchange flows.The Puell Multiple Indicator looks at miners' revenue relative to its 365-day average. High readings indicate miners may start selling aggressively, and are often seen near market tops.Large inflows to exchanges are usually signs of distribution, as investors prepare to sell their coins. BTC total transfer volume to exchanges + Puell Multiple.

The curved parabolic trendline that’s supported the rally is broken — a clear signal that the top is likely in. Meanwhile, altcoins and meme tokens may continue pumping a little longer.Complacency. Measure 15% below Bitcoin’s all-time high. That’s the sell zone. Order books on major exchanges often show a wall of sell orders around this level — a likely institutional exit point.According to Garner, the 15% (or 16%) rule works not only in crypto but in traditional markets as well.Historical blow off-tops: BTC, ETH, gold, Nasdaq, Nikkei, Broadvision, 3D Systems.

Based on the model, BTC is expected to progressively target price levels of $130,000 and $163,000 in the coming months. However, anonymous Bitcoin analyst apsk32 believed a price target above $200,000 is a “reasonable” expectation for 2025. Basing the projection on Bitcoin’s “power curve,” the analyst noted that BTC’s position relative to gold has significantly improved since April. From a technical standpoint, this view is supported by the recent convergence of the Sharpe ratios for Bitcoin and gold, suggesting that the two hard assets now offer comparable risk-to-reward profiles to their investors. Fidelity’s Director of Global Macro Jurrien Timmer shed light on this development, recommending a 4:1 goal-to-Bitcoin ratio from an allocation perspective. Related: Bitcoin 'blow-off top' set at $128K with new all-time highs in sightStrong Bitcoin volumes “final straw” before new highs Crypto researcher Aylo analyzed BTC’s historical price action when the crypto asset consolidates near its all-time high level. In an X post, the analyst explained, “The data shows when BTC gets close to its previous ATH during a strong, accelerating trend with high momentum, it has historically broken out to new ATHs within a short time (days to weeks).”However, weaker trends have led to stalls or retraces between March and May 2024. Currently, Bitcoin exhibits a strong trend but lacks the necessary trading volume, which remains the final straw to confirm a breakout, a factor that could delay upward movement.Alyo added that for Bitcoin to break its all-time highs, daily trading volume should exceed the previous 10 days, be at least 1.5 times the 20-day average, and ideally sustain a 3-day increase while the price holds steady or rises.Data from CryptoQuant has reinforced Aylo’s concerns about trading volume. On May 21, retail investor demand for Bitcoin, defined as wallets buying/selling between $0 and $10,000, remained low at just 3.2% over 30 days, despite BTC trading within $2,000 of its all-time high.Bitcoin’s retail investor volumes.

This indicates fresh capital inflows into the market at higher prices. As Cointelegraph reported, holding above $2,400 was crucial to ensure a potential $3,000 retest.Ethereum: Key pricing levels.

This concentration suggests many investors may sell at break-even, potentially stalling Ether’s upward momentum.Ethereum cost basis distribution chart.

ETH price dropped below this level in February, driven by risk-off sentiment following Trump’s tariff measures. ETH/USD weekly chart.

Ether ETFs registered $100.7 million in net inflows in the last three days, per Farside Investors’ data.Meanwhile, the bears will attempt to keep the $2,600 resistance in place to increase the likelihood of pulling the price lower. The immediate target is below the $2,400 level, or the 200-day SMA.Below $2,400, the next key area of interest remains between $2,200 and the psychological level at $2,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) set a new high of $109,400 on May 21, rising more than 26% in the past month, according to data from TradingView.

We’re seeing capital rotate into BTC and high-beta tech as the need for geopolitical hedging fades, but liquidity remains abundant.”The capital rotation reflects a “maturing narrative” as “Bitcoin is no longer just a fear hedge — it’s increasingly a high-conviction risk asset in periods of macro stability,” Kooner said.Source: Donald J.
