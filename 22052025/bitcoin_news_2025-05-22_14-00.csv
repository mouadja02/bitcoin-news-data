2025-05-22T11:50:48.000Z,"Top 5 Altcoins to Buy As Bitcoin Hits New ATH!","The post Top 5 Altcoins to Buy As Bitcoin Hits New ATH! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market today has forayed into a new phase of bullish momentum, driven by Bitcoin’s historic surge to a new all-time high beyond $111,000. This rally has pushed the total crypto market cap to an impressive $3.5 trillion, a 4.5% increase. Meanwhile, daily trading volume has soared to $197.45 billion, marking a sharp 53.67% rise. BTC dominance currently sits at 62.9%, and is expected to fade based on past experiences, and many believe the tide to altseason is about to return. Among the top contenders poised for strong performance are Ethereum, Solana, XRP, Chainlink, and SUI. Top 5 Altcoins to Buy Ethereum (ETH): Ethereum has shown a notable 5.15% gain in the last 24 hours, taking its price to $2662.56. Its run is fueled by a sharp increase in volume to $37.92 billion, a jump of nearly 65%. ETH’s recent rally represents a 50% increase from its pre-Pectra upgrade days, and many analysts expect this upward trend to continue. The price appears poised to break through the $3000 level in the coming weeks. Check out our Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! Solana (SOL): Solana is once again grabbing the spotlight with a 6.38% price surge since yesterday, taking its price to $178.72. Trading activity has intensified, with daily volume rising by more than 72% to $6.24 billion. Solana’s 2021 bull run performance, where it delivered a 100x return, continues to resonate with investors. With strong community support, an expanding DeFi ecosystem, and high-speed capabilities, SOL could soon reclaim the $200 mark. Technical indicators suggest that price targets of $220 and even $250 are within reach. XRP: XRP price has seen a 4.20% rise in the past 24 hours, changing hands at $2.43 after ranging between $2.34 and $2.45. Volume has also jumped to $4.29 billion, up over 43%. The renewed bullishness around XRP is supported by a surge in open interest, which now sits at $4.69 billion, and the fact that XRP futures are outperforming Ethereum ETFs. On a technical level, the XRP/BTC chart shows bullish RSI divergence, suggesting a potential reversal is near. In a bullish case, XRP could defy odds to hit $3 soon, as seen on the XRP/TetherUS chart. Chainlink (LINK): Chainlink, aka LINK price, is up 6.66% to $16.64 over the past day. Its price was assisted by a volume increase of nearly 63% to $784.63 million. LINK is expected to do good, thanks to its critical role as a decentralized oracle provider, integral for the functionality of DeFi, insurance protocols, gaming platforms, and real-world asset tokenization. Additionally, Chainlink staking has added a compelling incentive for long-term holders, with competitive yields attracting both retail and institutional interest. If LINK can break through resistance at $17.40, a move toward $19.80 is the next technical target. SUI SUI is rising as a standout in the Layer-1 category, posting a strong 8.98% gain over the past 24 hours to reach $4.18. It has traded in the range of $3.84 to $4.19, with volume spiking by nearly 74% to $2.14 billion. Backed by increasing development activity and rising social volume, SUI appears well-positioned for a breakout. Analysts are optimistic about its potential to reclaim its previous high of $5.37 and even eye $11. Also read our SUI Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! FAQs Is now a good time to invest in altcoins? Yes, with Bitcoin hitting new highs and its market dominance expected to decline, altcoins are likely to outperform in the short to mid-term. When will altseason start? Now that Bitcoin has created a new ATH with a price surge of over 10%, we can expect an altseason once BTC dominance falls below 60%. What altcoins should I buy? Considering the current trends, one can opt for blue-chip cryptos such as Ethereum, Solana, XRP, Chainlink, and SUI.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/top-5-altcoins-to-buy-as-bitcoin-hits-new-ath/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|LINK|TRADING","Price Analysis|Altcoins",cryptocompare
2025-05-22T11:48:44.000Z,"Whale buys back ETH holdings after losing $2.6M by selling early","A crypto trader spent $3.8 million to buy Ether at a significantly higher price after selling the asset for almost the same amount about a month ago. On May 22, blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain reported that a crypto wallet spent $3.8 million to purchase 1,425 Ether ( ETH ) at $2,670 per coin, reentering ETH after a major rally. On April 13, the same wallet sold 2,522 ETH for $3.9 million, when the asset was trading at about $1,570, a decision that, in retrospect, looks poorly-timed. “Think twice before selling your bags,” Lookonchain wrote, highlighting the potential gains if the trader just held on to their Ether instead of selling and repurchasing it at a higher price point. Whale buys ETH after selling over a month ago. Source: DeBank Trader loses out on $2.6 million gain With ETH up over 70% since the sale, the trader lost out on over 1,000 ETH, or roughly $2.67 million, in the process of buying back in. If the trader decided to hold on to their Ether, the assets would be worth about $6.7 million. As ETH rallied, the asset surpassed the market capitalization of big companies like Coca-Cola and Alibaba. At the time of writing, company data tracker 8marketcap shows that Ether’s $321 billion market capitalization makes it the 38th most-valuable asset in the world, surpassing the pharmaceutical company AbbVie and inching closer to the Bank of America. Ether’s upswing is largely fueled by the successful launch of its Pectra upgrade . The new update introduced improvements to the network’s scalability, validator user experience and smart wallet functionality. These updates are expected to drive broader adoption of the Ethereum mainnet.

A May 19 report from digital asset manager CoinShares revealed that US crypto investment products saw $785 million in inflows last week. This development pushes the year-to-date (YTD) total for crypto ETPs to $7.5 billion. ETH was the top performer among the crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs), attracting $205 million in inflows last week. This represents 26% of all the inflows within the time period. This also brings ETH’s YTD total to over $575 million. The CoinShares report also attributed the increased inflows to renewed investor optimism following the Pectra upgrade and the Ethereum Foundation’s appointment of Tomasz Stańczak as a co-executive director.

A filing with the Maine Attorney General’s Office outlines the massive scope of the breach, which happened in late December but was not discovered by Coinbase until earlier this month. The exchange says criminals bribed a small group of overseas customer support agents to copy the data of less than 1% of the firm’s monthly transacting users. Coinbase notes that hacked information includes names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, masked social security numbers (the last 4 digits only), masked bank-account numbers, some bank account identifiers, government-ID images, account data and limited corporate data. The exchange says impacted customers were notified by email on May 15th. Coinbase learned about the hack after receiving an email earlier this month demanding a $20 million Bitcoin ( BTC ) payoff in exchange for not releasing the illegally obtained info. The company refused to give in to the hackers’ demand and estimates it will pay $180 million to $400 million in remediation costs and voluntary customer reimbursements. In a video posted to the social media platform X, Coinbase chief executive Brian Armstrong promised the exchange would pay back impacted customers, increase cyberattack defenses and relocate certain overseas customer support operations.

2025-05-22T11:39:03.000Z,"Why Are Bitcoin Traders Aggressively Shorting as BTC Hits New Record High?","Bitcoin {BTC} galloped to a new record high above $110,000 on Thursday, liquidating around $500 million worth of derivatives positions in its wake, but some traders aren't buying into the bullish sentiment. Trading volume jumped by 74% in the past 24 hours as traders attempted to position themselves, however the majority of these traders are opting to go short -- or bet on bitcoin moving downwards. Coinalyze data shows that the long/short ratio is at its lowest point since September 2022, which was the midst of crypto winter. This trend began on April 21 as traders aggressively shorted the breakout above $85,000, seemingly under the impression that bitcoin had already formed its cycle high and that any subsequent move would form a double top. However, despite a lack of retail participation , bitcoin continued to grind higher, taking out levels of resistance at $97,000 and $105,000 on its path. The move can be attributed to a number of factors; a recovery in U.S. equities as tariff concerns cooled, a rise in institutional activity on exchanges, like the CME, and crucially a wealth of short positions to squeeze and force prices higher. While these short positions might be considered bearish in terms of market structure, they are actually fanning the flame to the upside as it gives bullish traders areas to target and conduct stop-loss hunts like we saw earlier this week. Shorting an asset's record high is not necessarily a bad strategy; a trader will often opt to enter a short position at a level of resistance, whether that be technical or psychological, and layer stop losses above where the thesis of a short trade would be invalidated. In this case, if a trader shorted $105,000 on each of BTCs three tests of that area, they could have closed their position in profit on three occasions at $102,000, meaning that even if they were stopped out of the trade at $109,000, it would be a profitable week. Alongside the continued rise in short positions we have seen open interest jump disproportionately to BTC. Over the past 24 hours BTC is up 4.8% while open interest is up by 17% despite hundreds of million being liquidated. This indicates that the record high break is driven by leverage and might be less sustainable that the initial drives above $100,000 in December and January. It remains to be seen whether interest in short positions continues to rise if BTC rolls on with its momentous move above $111,000, but there is certainly a minefield of short positions to squeeze if it needs some ammunition.

2025-05-22T11:36:08.000Z,"Trump Adviser David Sacks Says Stablecoin Bill Set to Pass Senate – Could Unlock Trillions for U.S. Treasuries","David Sacks, senior crypto adviser to President Donald Trump, announced on May 21 that bipartisan momentum is propelling the GENIUS Actlandmark stablecoin legislation through the U.S. Senate. The bill, which aims to bring regulatory clarity to a $200 billion stablecoin market, has cleared an important procedural hurdle with the support of 15 Democrats , making its passage highly likely. Sacks framed the bill as a long-overdue regulatory fix and a geopolitical and financial inflection point. He argued that by legitimizing dollar-pegged digital assets under federal law, the legislation could dramatically increase global demand for U.S. Treasuries, potentially injecting trillions of dollars into the American financial system. White House crypto czar David Sacks says stablecoin bill will unlock 'trillions' for U.S. Treasury https://t.co/SfOw09ZRAq — CNBC (@CNBC) May 21, 2025 “We already have over $200 billion in stablecoins—it’s just unregulated,” Sacks told CNBC. “If we provide the legal clarity and framework for this, I think we could create trillions of dollars of demand for our Treasuries practically overnight.” Generally known as the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act , the bill is the most advanced federal effort to date to establish legal guardrails for stablecoins. If passed, it would authorize the issuance of stablecoins fully backed by U.S. dollars or Treasuries, subject to licensing and reserve requirements under federal oversight. Trump Ties and Political Tension Cloud Stablecoin Bill Momentum While the bill’s technical merits have drawn rare bipartisan support, controversy continues to swirl around potential conflicts of interest. Critics point to the Trump family’s ties to World Liberty Financial , a crypto firm recently launching its stablecoin, USD1, which U.S. Treasuries and fiat reserves reportedly back. The token has secured a $2 billion investment commitment from Abu Dhabi’s MGX fund via Binance, raising questions about whether the administration’s policy initiatives are aligned with private family investments. Sacks, who says he divested $200 million in crypto holdings before joining the administration, declined to comment on whether Trump or his family stands to benefit from the bill’s passage. Trump's AI and Crypto Czar @DavidSacks confirmed he sold all direct crypto holdings before the President’s administration began. #DavidSacks #CryptoRegulation https://t.co/TpZaVpYl1J — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 3, 2025 When pressed on the ethics of presidential crypto ventures, he avoided specifics, instead emphasizing the bill’s transformative economic potential. Still, the GENIUS Act’s path to final passage isn’t entirely smooth. Senator Josh Hawley recently added a provision capping credit card late fees amendment that could alienate key financial industry backers and complicate the coalition needed to pass the bill. Yield-Bearing Stablecoins Signal Industry Shift Meanwhile, the broader stablecoin ecosystem is evolving rapidly. Once considered regulatory gray zones, yield-bearing stablecoins are gaining legitimacy under the Trump administration’s regulatory shift. In February, the SEC approved such tokens as “certificates” governed under securities laws rather than banning them. This move opened the door to compliant products offering interest to stablecoin holders, provided they meet disclosure, registration, and investor protection standards. This move is backed by the growing momentum around the stablecoins. Yield-bearing stablecoins surged to $11 billion in circulation from just $1.5 billion at the start of 2024, now accounting for 4.5% of the total stablecoin supply . Stablecoin supply reaches $200B, signaling increased liquidity across exchanges. Historical patterns suggest this could impact $BTC and broader #CryptoMarkets . #Blockchain #Stablecoins https://t.co/uiSRxnoEtz — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 31, 2025 Decentralized protocols like Pendle have emerged as primary beneficiaries. Pendle, which allows users to lock in fixed yields or speculate on variable interest rates, currently holds nearly $3 billion in total value locked (TVL) from yield-bearing stablecoins, making up 30% of the sector’s TVL. Stablecoins now represent 83% of Pendle’s total TVLup, up from less than 20% a year ago, while traditional assets like ETH have fallen to under 10%. This shift indicates growing user preference for stablecoin-based yield opportunities at a time when traditional tokens remain volatile and the Federal Reserve maintains high interest rates. While dominant, legacy stablecoins such as USDT and USDC still do not pass on yield to holders. With over $200 billion in circulation and Fed rates hovering at 4.3%, Pendle estimates that stablecoin holders forgo more than $9 billion in annual interest.

2025-05-22T11:30:13.000Z,"Ripple CEO snubbed by Lummis: XRP FUD Fuels crypto drama","On May 19, 2025, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse revealed on X that his high-stakes meeting with Sen. Cynthia Lummis, chair of the Digital Assets Subcommittee, was abruptly canceled, sending shockwaves through Crypto X. Speculation erupted, with many pointing to Lummis’ son-in-law, Will Cole—a vocal Bitcoin maximalist known for reposting anti-Ripple content—as a potential influence behind the snub, fueling fresh waves of XRP FUD. The timing of this cancelled meeting only fuels the fire as it coincides with the alleged behind-the-scenes negotiation between Circle and Ripple, with the latter attempting to buy the former. Another company interested in buying Circle is Coinbase, a company that gets along with Lummis better, according to observers. Ripple has the money to bid for Circle solely due to dumping XRP. They are trying to buy Circle because stablecoins make the usecase XRP was supposed to fulfil utterly useless. They know this, they've known it for years while they dumped billions of dollars worth of XRP on… https://t.co/qV28WzPzHC — Rex (@R89Capital) May 20, 2025 Ripple critics again alleged that the real reason behind buying Circle is dumping XRP coins in exchange for fiat money. Ripple is an American company behind one of the top five cryptocurrencies, XRP. From the start, Ripple took a path different from the mainstream anti-banking ethos of the crypto community. XRP was supposed to be a cryptocurrency integrated into the traditional banking system. XRP is in control of Ripple. It has high transaction speed and network capacity; however, many doubt that Ripple can be called decentralized. The company was founded by Jed McCaleb and Chris Larsen. Brad Garlinghouse became CEO in 2016. Possible reasons for meeting cancellation Lummis is hands down one of the most prominent pro-crypto U.S. lawmakers of the 2020s. As the CEO of one of the biggest cryptocurrency brands, Ripple, Garlinghouse believed he would be involved in the high-profile stakes discussion over stablecoin legislation in the US. However, it seems the CEO is being ghosted by the regulatory circle around Lummis, with observers noting that there may be a rift forming between the two. Garlinghouse himself took to X to voice these concerns. Heading to DC to champion sensible pro-crypto legislation around stablecoins and market structure, and I’m very encouraged to see our elected officials look at crypto as it should be – a multichain industry. That said, @SenLummis , as Chair of the Digital Assets Subcommittee,… — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) May 19, 2025 There may be many reasons for the cancellation of this meeting. One of the first things that comes to mind is that these days the Senate turned into a battlespace around the Genius Act, a bill aimed to create a framework for the U.S. stablecoin issuers. The bill was blocked by the Senate Democrats earlier this month. Lummis and her colleagues in the Senate were working for two weeks to make amendments to win the Democrats’ vote on May 20, when the Senate voted on the latest iteration of the bill, right after the planned meeting with Garlinghouse. You might also like: Senator Lummis claims Trump supports 1M Bitcoin strategic reserve bill Ripple advocates pointed to a different motive beyond a mere scheduling conflict, suspecting that Sen.

Rochard believes that the company is selling its coin XRP all the time to get revenue. It makes him think that Ripple is kind of a centralized fraud company that creates XRP coins out of thin air and sells them in exchange for fiat money. Bitcoin purists voice similar accusations against Ethereum as well. I will continue to speak out against Ripple XRP, it’s not a real blockchain and it’s not decentralized.

The central bank-issued cryptocurrencies are an approach that has become mainstream in Europe. The GOP, however, opposes a digital dollar and prefers stablecoins issued by the companies, as they don’t compromise operational privacy. Read more: Senate crypto bill collapses: Is partisan divide or Trump’s digital fortune to blame? Pierre Rochard himself points to the pro-Democrat sentiment of Ripple’s co-founder Chris Larsen, who donated $10 million worth of XRP to Kamala Harris when she was running for the office. This donation made Larsen the biggest individual sponsor of the Harris. Larsen explained in the X post that he believes Harris will ensure that American technology will dominate the world. Garlinghouse distanced himself from the support for Harris, but emphasized that the Biden-era approach to crypto should be changed for a better one. The fact of the donation became another reason to accuse Ripple of dumping its coins in bulk. https://twitter.com/Hexologist31/status/1848410473575649766 While it is clear why Cole or like-minded people sharply oppose Ripple, it is still not clear why Sen. Lummis should cancel the meeting with Garlinghouse based on her political leanings. While criticism persists, Ripple continues to struggle legally, as on May 15, a judge denied the SEC settlement, which could help Ripple solve its problems. It seems that 2025 is a harder year for Ripple than for many other U.S. crypto giants.

Accordingly, Michigan lawmakers have introduced four bills regarding cryptocurrencies. Michigan lawmakers have introduced four new bills related to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, according to Decrypt. The new bills in Michigan would allow Bitcoin retirement investments, ban state CBDC backing, and offer tax breaks for crypto mining in oil fields. House Bill 4510 aims to allow public pension funds to invest in Bitcoin through regulated ETF products, provided that the funds have an average market value of at least $250 billion over the past year. House Bill 4511 seeks to prohibit government agencies from supporting or promoting a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC). The bill aims to block government support for a U.S. central bank CBDC and prohibit government agencies from any licensing, taxation, or official advocacy of CBDCs. Bills 4512 and 4513 focus on encouraging BTC mining in abandoned oil wells and offer tax incentives to companies that engage in such operations for environmental remediation.

However, ownership declined, falling to 29% in 2025 from 40% the previous year, according to Independent Reserve’s fifth annual Singapore Crypto Market Survey released on May 21. The survey, conducted in February with 1,500 participants, revealed that men remain more active in crypto investing than women, 35% compared to 24%. Millennials and Gen X (aged 25–54) dominate the investor base, comprising 71% of all holders. Among those trading at least once a week, 76% fall into this age group.

2025-05-22T11:21:09.000Z,"Best Altcoins to Buy as Bitcoin Explosion Promises New Altcoin Season","After hitting ATH after ATH, Bitcoin ($BTC) is now edging close to the $111K mark after briefly touching it earlier today. A combination of institutional demand, supply-side dynamics, and broader macroeconomic conditions has driven $BTC’s recent surge to a record high. As $BTC dominates the spotlight, crypto analysts are eyeing what could come next. A new altcoin season is high on their radar, as the best altcoins are set to explode. $BTC Jumps 71% in Daily Volume & Overtakes Amazon Underscoring $BTC’s market authority, its 24-hour trading volume is up by over 71% and its market cap is an eye-boggling $2.19T. Following the rise, $BTC made history again yesterday, overtaking Amazon in market cap . Consequently, it’s now the fifth most valuable asset on the planet. A key reason for this is the influx of capital into US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have snagged over $2.8B in net this month. These products have propelled the total number of held Bitcoin ETFs to surpass $122B, further reflecting investors’ growing appetite for exposure to the #1 crypto. The April halving event also contributed to the crypto king’s rise. It tightened Bitcoin’s supply, slashing block rewards in half and reducing the rate at which new $BTC enters circulation. Halving events have, historically, acted as bullish catalysts in creating scarcity. And this cycle appears to be no different. Macroeconomic tailwinds also contribute to the $BTC buzz. Looser monetary conditions, increased market liquidity, and geopolitical uncertainty – particularly heightened trade tensions – have caused the US dollar to weaken. In turn, this has propelled riskier assets like $BTC. Since Donald Trump was elected president on November 5, the US dollar has declined by over 7% over the past six months. As the flagship crypto continues to stand tall in both DeFi and TradFi, attention turns to a broader altcoin rally possibly being on the horizon. But according to eToro Australia analyst Reece Hobson, a true altcoin season will only kick off when two key events align : ‘Quantitative easing must begin, injecting more liquidity into the system, and Bitcoin dominance needs to hit around 70%.’ Per CoinGecko data, $BTC’s dominance currently stands at 61.50% , so it shouldn’t be too long until it reaches that target. Now could be the perfect time to enter the new altcoin season before rising demand sends prices soaring. Ahead of the highly anticipated market frenzy, we’re bullish on BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) , MIND of Pepe ($MIND) , and Hyperliquid ($HYPE) – and for good reasons. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Win Free $BTC Before the Crypto King Possibly Reaches $300K Do you want to ride the Bitcoin and altcoin rally without spending a fortune? The BTC Bull Token ecosystem makes that possible. It offers a novel way to earn free $BTC, plus snag more of its native token, $BTCBULL. Imagine receiving $BTC automatically when Bitcoin hits new milestones ($150K and $200K). Well, the BTC Bull Token ecosystem does precisely that. To top it off, you can anticipate winning a large $BTCBULL airdrop when the crypto leader hits the $250K mark. For airdrop eligibility, all you need to do is buy and hold $BTCBULL in Best Wallet , our #1 anonymous crypto wallet . You can also save on gas fees when buying $BEST , its native coin. Crypto analyst ‘PlanB’ predicts that $BTC could soar to $300K if the S&P 500 hits 7K points by year-end. With markets heating up and momentum building, the airdrops might be a stone’s throw away. You can stake $BTCBULL for additional income at a 67% APY. Over 1.5M tokens have already joined the staking pool, showing strong community trust and growing investor confidence. And there’s more. $BTCBULL has planned token burns when $BTC hits $125K, $175K, and $225K. Reducing its token supply at these key milestones could increase its demand and price as Bitcoin rallies. With over $6M already raised on presale, fueled by a whale investor recently contributing $19K and then another $20K , momentum is clearly building. You can buy $BTCBULL for just $0.002525. Its price will increase in two days and could reach $0.006467 after exchange listings, so now’s a prime time to get involved. 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – AI-Powered Altcoin Nears Presale Close With $9.8M Raised MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is quickly emerging as a standout altcoin, having raised $9.8M ahead of its presale close on May 31, 2025 – the final chance to buy before it hits the open market. At the heart of the MIND of Pepe ecosystem is an AI agent that launched on May 10, 2025. It scours social media, dApps, and Web3 ecosystems to detect early market trends. Such insights are already being shared with $MIND holders, and some public updates are also posted on its X account ( @MIND_agent ) and the MIND of Pepe Telegram channel . The agent is rapidly expanding to stay ahead of the curve. It’s getting ready to integrate tools like persona-trained large language models (LLMs) , Solana and DexScreener trackers, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) , and vector embeddings . Soon, holders will also gain entry into the MIND of Pepe Terminal, a live dashboard that delivers real-time market analytics and trading signals for an even sharper edge. Now’s your last chance to buy $MIND for $0.0037515. It’ll likely get a bigger boost once listed on the best crypto exchanges , possibly bringing its price to $0.00535 . 3. Hyperliquid ($HYPE) – Daily Market Cap Surges 18% Over Powering Leading DEX Last but not least, there’s $HYPE. Its market cap has spiked by 18% since yesterday, reaching $10.43B. Albeit more expensive at $31.15, its sharp rise makes it one to watch as the bull run continues to unfold. $HYPE turns heads as the backbone of Hyperliquid, the highest-ranked DEX that commands 45%+ of the market share and boasts a daily trading volume exceeding $19B. Ultimately, it wants to rival CEXs’ speed and features while maintaining decentralization’s transparency and self-custody benefits. $HYPE serves several purposes within the Hyperliquid ecosystem, including governance, staking, and gas token fees. Therefore, after buying the coin, you can spur the DEX’s overall direction, earn staking rewards, and pay for transaction fees seamlessly. You can buy the coin on various exchanges, including Bitget, MEXC, and KuCoin. Invest Before a Possible New Altcoin Season $BTC’s explosive spike, spurred by ETFs, a post-halving supply crunch, and macro conditions, possibly lays the groundwork for a new altcoin season. If you’re waiting for the right moment to capitalize on the best altcoins, that moment is now. Whether you want to win free $BTC, receive hot crypto insights ahead of the rest, or have governance rights in the top-ranked DEX, $BTCBULL , $MIND , and $HYPE are worth a look. However, you must always DYOR and never invest more than you’d be sad to lose. Only time can truly test their market success.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/best-altcoins-bitcoin-explosion-promises-altcoin-season/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Crypto News",cryptocompare
2025-05-22T11:18:29.000Z,"Hyperliquid Soars As Open Interest Hits Record High — Is $HYPE Set For A New ATH?","The post Hyperliquid Soars As Open Interest Hits Record High — Is $HYPE Set For A New ATH? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Key Highlights: Hyperliquid’s open interest surged to $997.5M, its highest ever (CoinGlass). HYPE price spiked 22% in 7 days, now trading at $30.72. RSI at 76.76 and MACD crossover indicate overbought momentum (TradingView). OBV and CMF reflect rising accumulation and strong capital inflow (Chart data). Whale suffered $18.88M loss on a 5x short, highlighting bullish dominance (Lookonchain). Analyst Bias: Cautiously bullish; continuation likely if $32.67 is breached with volume. With Open Interest nearing $1B and HYPE breaking past $30, traders are watching for a breakout to retest the $35 ATH. Whale liquidations and strong on-chain metrics are signalling continued upside. HYPE/USDT Price Analysis: Resistance Levels in Sight Hyperliquid coin has shown strong bullish momentum this month, surging nearly 96% from its April low. The rally began after a prolonged downtrend that started around Feb 22 , when HYPE traded just below $18 and slid to a cycle low of $15.70 by April 8 — marking a ~15% drop. This downtrend established a critical support zone between $15.70 and $18.00 , which served as the springboard for the rally. From there, HYPE reversed strongly, climbing nearly 96% to its current price of $30.72 . Now, the token is approaching the $32.67–$35.00 resistance zone , aligning with both its December ATH and the whale liquidation mark. RSI at 78.20 confirms overbought territory, signalling strong bullish momentum. MACD has crossed above its signal line, and Bollinger Bands are widening, with price hugging the upper band — all supportive of trend continuation. The EMA stack (20/50/100/200) is in perfect bullish alignment. HYPE remains well above the 20-day EMA, now a key support near $28.20 . Holding this level suggests strength in buying dips. Volume & Capital Flows: Bulls in Control Capital flow indicators further validate the uptrend. CMF at +0.30 signals robust inflows, while OBV is rising after months of decline — a clear indicator of renewed net accumulation. This confluence adds weight to the bullish case for a breakout above $32.67. Momentum strongly favors bulls, but entries at current levels carry higher risk due to stretched indicators. A volume-backed breakout above $32.67 or a retracement toward $28.20–$25.10 could offer stronger entry points. Bulls remain in control unless $25 breaks down. On-Chain Metrics: Volume Surge and Whale Liquidations Open Interest has now reached $997.57M (as of May 22), suggesting increased leverage and directional bets — sourced from CoinGlass . Perpetual volume is surging alongside DEX activity, with Hyperliquid leading OI dominance across platforms. According to Artemis Terminal , DEX trading volume has surged 97.4% month-over-month , while daily protocol revenue climbed to $3.1M , up from ~$2.1M a few weeks ago. Daily transactions are holding above 429.4M , reinforcing consistent usage. Whale activity is also shaping sentiment: As per Lookonchain , on May 22, a whale took a 5x leveraged short against HYPE, posting 2.05M USDC — only to face an $18.88M unrealized loss , with liquidation looming at $32.67 . Data from Mitrade also highlighted another whale placing a $830M BTC long at 40x leverage on Hyperliquid, reflecting increasing platform confidence. These whale movements — both failed shorts and bullish long entries — support the current uptrend in HYPE’s structure. Conclusion: ATH in Sight, But Momentum Must Hold Hyperliquid’s native token HYPE, is experiencing a textbook breakout scenario, backed by strong technicals and on-chain activity. With leverage piling up and whale shorts getting punished, the path to retesting $35 looks increasingly probable. However, traders should monitor the $32.67 zone closely. A breakout above this level with rising volume could flip it into support and trigger a new ATH. Failure to breach may invite consolidation toward $28.20 or even $25.10. Bullish bias remains intact while above $28.20. A breakout above $32.67 confirms upside continuation.

2025-05-22T11:17:27.000Z,"Why Is Crypto Up Today? – May 22, 2025","The bull is running. All top 10 coins and nearly all 100 coins per market cap saw their prices rise in the last 24 hours as a result of the ongoing crypto ETF positive flows and regulatory advancements, particularly in the stablecoin sector. At the same time, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has increased by 1.1% to $3.61 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $198 billion, the highest we’ve seen in weeks. TLDR: The crypto market rally continues as BTC hits fresh all-time highs; The bull market boosts investor confidence, sentiment, spending, and profit; Rally has more room to extend; ‘Pullbacks should be seen as entry opportunities—not signs of reversal’; Spot Bitcoin ETFs see a net inflow of $608.99 million; The rally remains sustainable, though pullbacks and short-term corrections are possible. Crypto Winners & Losers All top 10 coins per market cap have appreciated over the past day. Cardano (ADA) is the day’s best performer, for the second day in a row. It’s up 3.6% to $0.7876. Bitcoin (BTC) follows with a rise of 3.4%, currently trading at $111,187. The world’s number one coin has been testing new all-time highs for several hours now. At the time of writing, its highest local and all-time price is $111,544. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) appreciated 0.9%, now changing hands at $2,623. It’s daily high is $2,631, the same level as yesterday. Furthermore, of the top 100 coins, only seven are red today, all with decreases between Maker (MKR)’s 0.6% and Aave (AAVE)’s 3.4%. The two trade at $1,762 and $252, respectively. The rally drivers remain the same: it’s a powerful combination of significant surge in crypto exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) inflows and favorable regulatory developments, further boosted by the somewhat improved US-China trade sentiment and a US sovereign debt credit downgrade by Moody’s. As a result, risk capital has been diverted back into crypto. The sector seems to be winning a battle towards clearer regulations. The US Senate has voted to advance the GENIUS Act . Blockchain Association Interim CEO and Head of Policy, Sarah Milby, described the move as “a meaningful step toward establishing clear, common sense rules for stablecoins.” 2/ With this vote, Congress has signaled that the United States is serious about leading the future of digital finance – where trust, innovation, and dollar dominance intersect. — Blockchain Association (@BlockchainAssn) May 20, 2025 Crypto investment firm Bitwise CEO Matt Hougan has argued that the Act will legitimize mainstream stablecoin usage and propel this section of the market from $236 billion to $2.5 trillion .

The Short-Term Holder cohort’s percentage of supply in profit increasing by more than 7% over the last month – the second-largest positive uptick in profitability for this cohort on record. The fresh ATH will provide additional fuel. Source: Glassnode All investor cohorts have seen improvement in their financial position. “This likely has the knock-on effect” of boosting investor confidence, sentiment, and spending, Glassnode says. “As market conditions improve, and investor portfolios recover, many are taking the opportunity to lock in profits.” Source: Glassnode The analyst team from the crypto exchange Bitfinex commented how Bitcoin has just reclaimed new all-time highs, breaking above the $109.5,000 level “with conviction and volume.” They stated that the move was a squeeze at first. The price moved up on short liquidations, and the first break could be reversed on lower timeframes. However, the rally from 75,000 onwards has been driven by “clean spot demand, ETF inflows, and a macro backdrop that continues to favour risk-on assets.” Per the team, “The recent geopolitical de-escalation (Russia–Ukraine), dovish undertones from global central banks, and softening inflation prints have all created an ideal environment for Bitcoin to act as a macro momentum asset.” Furthermore, the analysts noted stable funding rates, CVDs showing strong spot-led flows, and consistent ETF inflows, especially during US hours. “This is not leverage-driven,” the analysts argue. “It’s structurally bid. With open interest now rising alongside price (rather than front-running it), there’s room for this move to stretch further”. Levels & Events to Watch Next After briefly dipping its finger to test the all-time waters, BTC surged and surpassed the $109,900 level, followed by $110,000, and finally $111,100. How long it will be able to sustain it remains to be seen, but it has made significant long-term strides regardless of possible pullbacks. Per the Bitfinex analysts, the next zone to watch is $114,00–$118,000 as minor liquidity walls. After that, the next step is the $123,000–$125,000 zone, where large options open interest is building. “As long as ETF flows hold and macro doesn’t deliver a shock, this rally has room to extend. Pullbacks should be seen as entry opportunities—not signs of reversal.” Moreover, the Fear and Greed Index has jumped from 69 to 73 in a day, showcasing increased greed, rising investor confidence, boosted optimism, and a general willingness to take risks. Source: CoinMarketCap Moreover, so far on 22 May, spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen a significant net inflow of $608.99 million . This is its sixth consecutive day of inflows. The cumulative total net inflow reached $43.38 billion. Also, spot Ethereum ETFs recorded $587,130 in net inflows, for a fourth day of positive flows, resulting in the cumulative inflow of $2.59 billion. Furthermore, as crypto rallied, decentralized trading platform Hyperliquid saw open interest climb to a record $8.9 billion.

This may also reflect on the market, so it’s something to keep an eye on, especially given the support some crypto insiders have given this endeavor. Honored to support @POTUS and grateful for the invitation from @GetTrumpMemes to attend President Trump’s Gala Dinner as his TOP fan!

Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) May 20, 2025 Quick FAQ Why did crypto move against stocks today? As the crypto market rallies, the stock market records a notable drop. The S&P 500 is down 1.61%, the Nasdaq-100 fell 1.34%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average saw a decrease of 1.91%. Investors are turning to assets like crypto and gold due to the rising concerns over rising Treasury yields, inflation, and interest rate hikes. Furthermore, Trump is pushing to pass a tax-cut bill that could add between $3 trillion and $5 trillion to the $36.2 trillion government debt. Is this rally sustainable? The rally remains strong for now. It has found strong support in institutional demand, fueled by macroeconomic conditions. That said, pullbacks are likely, while the growing greed could lead to short-term downward corrections.

2025-05-22T11:16:09.000Z,"Bitcoin ETF Inflows Soar as IBIT Posts Biggest Daily Surge in 2 Weeks","BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, has posted its largest single-day inflow in over two weeks, attracting over half a billion dollars on May 21 as Bitcoin continues to soar toward new all-time highs . With traders increasingly allocating capital to spot Bitcoin ETFs, market excitement appears to be intensifying amid a broader crypto rally. According to data from Farside Investors, IBIT brought in a staggering $530.6 million in net inflows on Tuesday—its biggest haul since May 5, when it collected $531.2 million. The fund has now avoided a single outflow since April 9, solidifying its status as a dominant player in the Bitcoin ETF landscape. Perhaps even more striking is the rate at which IBIT is absorbing Bitcoin . In just one day, the fund acquired 4,931 BTC—more than ten times the 450 BTC that were mined over the same 24-hour period. This level of accumulation reflects strong institutional demand and suggests that many are betting on further price appreciation. Bitcoin ETF Volume Surge Mirrors BTC Breakout The explosive inflow was matched by a surge in trading activity. IBIT recorded its busiest trading day since January, according to market tracker Trader T. The ETF Store president, Nate Geraci, noted that the strong volume could indicate even more inflows in the days to come. “Given trading volume today, expect these inflow numbers to increase,” he commented. In total, the eleven U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETF funds recorded $607.1 million in net inflows on May 21. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) took the second-highest share with $23.5 million in new capital. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas described the scene as a “classic feeding frenzy,” fueled by Bitcoin’s price rally, which pushed the cryptocurrency to nearly $112,000 in early May 22 trading. Balchunas pointed out that ETF volumes haven’t reached such levels since January, when Bitcoin was hovering near its then all-time high. “Most ETFs are going to see 2x their average flows incoming,” he said, hinting at a potentially sustained wave of investment. Continued Momentum Amid Rate Speculation? Industry experts believe the ETF inflow trend may still be in its early stages. Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE, noted that Bitcoin ETFs have already attracted $3.6 billion in net inflows this month alone. He emphasized that investor interest could accelerate further if the Federal Reserve signals upcoming interest rate cuts. Meanwhile, Jupiter Zheng, partner at HashKey Capital, said Bitcoin’s breakout above $110,000 puts the asset into “uncharted price discovery territory.” He warned of heightened volatility ahead but added that ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and economic instability could push more investors toward Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. As institutional capital continues to pour into spot Bitcoin ETF products , the crypto market may be getting ready for even greater opportunity.

2025-05-22T11:15:00.000Z,"Crypto Daybook Americas: All Signs Point Up as Bitcoin Hits Record High","By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin BTC surpassed Wednesday's record to reach an all-time high of $111,875 in the early hours of Thursday, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index , as traditional financial markets contended with rising bond yields and renewed concerns over ballooning U.S. debt. The largest cryptocurrency has gained around 3.8% in the last 24 hours while the broader CoinDesk 20 CD20 index rose 4.74%, continuing a trend of strength driven by mounting institutional demand and growing interest in crypto exposure. The rally is unfolding against a backdrop of higher yields on U.S. and Japanese government bonds. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose to 4.6%, while the 30-year topped 5%, driven by concerns over President Donald Trump’s tax bill that analysts estimate could add as much as $5 trillion to the country’s debt, according to Reuters. In Japan, yields on 30- and 40-year government bonds also hit record highs. The country’s debt-to-GDP ratio stands at 234%, QCP Capital said , and growing scrutiny coupled with weak demand for long-dated JGBs sent yields soaring. That matters because higher yields — and thus higher returns — on investments that are considered relatively safe tend to lower the appeal of riskier assets like stocks, not to mention cryptocurrencies. While BTC, with its history of trading as a risky asset, hasn't shown much sign of ebbing demand, it raises the question of how long the rally can continue. Still, traders have been building large long positions in BTC options, with the most open interest now concentrated at the $110,000, $120,000 and even $300,000 calls for contracts expiring in late June in a sign of continuing bullish conviction. U.S.-traded spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds have also been seeing significant demand. Total net inflows hit $1.6 billion over the week, and $4.24 billion so far in May, SoSoValue data shows. The inflows, coupled with bitcoin’s price rise, have seen the ETFs' total net assets hit a record $129 billion. There are, however, some muted signs of bearish activity. “The largest block flow this week continues to be ETH December call spreads, while overnight BTC butterfly positions hint that some traders are positioning for consolidation around current levels,” Wintermute OTC trader Jake O. said. Note, he's talking about consolidation, not declines. And traditional participants may even be too bearish. While the U.S. endured a recent credit downgrade, markets are now pricing in a 6-level cut all the way down to BBB+. On top of that, per Jake O., a recent equities market sell-off may not be a result of repositioning given higher bond yields, but rather profit-taking after nine consecutive positive sessions.

Pseudonymous trader James Wynn opened a $1.1 billion long on BTC using 40x leverage via Hyperliquid in one of the largest on-chain DEX trades ever recorded. The position, tied to wallet \""0x507,\"" was entered when BTC was priced at $108K and now sits on over $40 million in unrealized profit. Wynn booked partial profits early Thursday by closing 540 BTC (~$60 million), to net $1.5 million. His prior exits were followed by BTC declines, so traders are watching closely, as reported . Hyperliquid runs on its custom L1, HyperEVM, using the HyperBFT consensus (200K+ TPS) with CEX-level features like real-time order books and deep liquidity — no KYC required. The platform’s permissionless design and lightning-fast execution are increasingly drawing capital from centralized venues to DeFi , and this trade could set a precedent for whale activity. HYPE jumped 15% in the past 24 hours on renewed attention and usage-driven speculation. Derivatives Positioning Analyzing the liquidations heatmap of the BTC-USDT pair on Binance, the largest liquidations cluster around $108.5K and $106.9K with liquidations worth $143 million and $112.5 million, respectively. Meanwhile, BTC the options market swells post-breakout, with open interest on Deribit climbing above $34 billion, just shy of the all-time high of $35.9 billion set in December. The bulk of this positioning is centered on the 30 May expiry, which now holds over $9 billion in notional value to become a key date for potential volatility. Bullish sentiment is clearly in control, with traders aggressively targeting upside via calls. Strikes at $100K, $120K and $150K have attracted particularly large open interest, reflecting growing conviction in a continued rally. Put/call ratios underscore this shift in sentiment — the 24-hour volume ratio has dropped to 0.49, while the open interest ratio sits at 0.60, indicating a meaningful tilt toward bullish exposure following BTC’s move above $110K. Near-term options activity is also picking up, with weekly and monthly contracts seeing notable inflows. Traders appear to be positioning for further momentum or short-term price swings in the wake of the breakout.

With a confirmed close above that level and no sign of a swing failure pattern, the bias remains firmly tilted toward continued upside. In the near term, BTC may encounter resistance around the $112,000–$113,000 range, aligning with a trendline drawn from the prior highs in December and January. However, last week’s consolidation above $100,000 — and the successful reclaim of the previous all-time high — suggest this area is now acting as short-term support. A pullback below $100,000, especially into the weekly order block, would likely represent a healthy correction within the broader uptrend and could offer a compelling reentry opportunity if further downside is seen.

Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Bitcoin: The Digital Gold Shaking Up the Financial World Bitcoin is the world's first cryptocurrency. It was created by someone known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Unlike traditional money, Bitcoin isn't controlled by any government or bank. Instead, it runs on a technology called blockchain, which allows people to send money directly to each other. This means no middlemen like banks are needed. Transactions are verified by miners, who solve complex puzzles to keep the network secure. Every four years, there's a \""halving\"" event that reduces the rewards miners get. There's also a limit of 21 million bitcoins that can ever exist. Right now, Bitcoin looks promising in the market. Its technology offers a way to make transactions securely and without central control. With the next halving approaching, many believe the price could go up due to the reduced supply. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin has the longest track record and the largest network. While newer coins offer exciting features, Bitcoin's simplicity and security make it attractive. In today's market, where more people are interested in digital assets, Bitcoin stands out as a strong option. Conclusion Bitcoin's rise past $107.6K signals a strong 2025 rally ahead. While top coins are promising, XYZVerse ($XYZ) stands out, blending sports and memes, aiming for massive 20,000% growth.

2025-05-22T11:00:48.000Z,"Bitcoin Blasts To $111,867 All-Time High—Here’s What’s Driving The Surge","Bitcoin pierced the $111,000 threshold for the first time in history on May 22, printing an intraday high of $111,867 on Binance, giving the asset a market capitalization of roughly $2.22 trillion, or two-thirds of the entire crypto market. The latest leg of the rally is being propelled by a tight confluence of catalysts that span institutional flows, corporate balance-sheet accumulation, and mounting macro-economic stress. #1 Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows From Wall Street to BlackRock’s vaults, US spot Bitcoin ETFs have turned into a one-way conduit of fresh capital. Farside Investors tallied $607.1 million of net subscriptions on 21 May, of which a blockbuster $530.6 million flowed into BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). That pushed the 11-day haul to more than $2.7 billion and lifted cumulative net inflows across the complex past $42 billion—an unprecedented pace for a six-month-old asset class. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breakout Narrative Explodes As Japan’s Bond Market Collapses “Over $500mil into iShares Bitcoin ETF…Nearly $2 bil just over past week or so. Inflows 26 of past 27 days. *$7+bil* in new $$$ overall. Given trading volume today, expect these inflow numbers to increase,” ETF Store president Nate Geraci posted on X. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas added that IBIT is posting “its 2nd biggest volume day ever today. Classic feeding frenzy in effect, new ATHs will do that, e.g. last time traded this much was 1/23 (last ATH). All the btc ETFs are elevated, most gonna see 2x their average. Flows incoming.” #2 Bitcoin Treasury Companies Parallel to the ETF torrent, a new cohort of listed companies is adopting Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset. Besides Strategy and Metaplanet, these companies bought billions of dollars in Bitcoin in recent weeks. Cantor Fitzgerald’s $3.6 billion SPAC deal will take Twenty One Capital public with more than 42,000 BTC on its books, backed by Tether, Bitfinex and SoftBank. Strive Asset Management is merging with Asset Entities on Nasdaq to create what it calls the first publicly traded asset-manager-led Bitcoin treasury company, equipped with a live $1 billion shelf to keep buying coin. Battery-tech firm KULR Technology Group lifted its stack to 800 BTC this week after a fresh $9 million purchase. Elsewhere, India’s Jetking Infotrain, Indonesia’s DigiAsia Corp, Brazil’s fintech Méliuz, France’s state lender Bpifrance and David Bailey’s Nakamoto Holdings, now merging with KindlyMD to build “the first decentralised Bitcoin treasury network,” among others, all unveiled accumulation strategies within the past month. Collectively these firms represent billions of dollars in spot, largely price-insensitive demand. #3 The New Narrative: A Brewing Macro Storm The macro backdrop is pouring fuel on the fire. Japanese super-long government bonds—once synonymous with near-zero yields—have gone bid-less, sending the 30-year JGB yield to a record 3.14 %. The move tightens the feedback loop linking Tokyo and Washington: Japanese institutions have been among the largest foreign holders of US Treasuries, and analysts warn that disorderly JGB liquidations could force sales of US debt just as the Treasury must refinance roughly $8 trillion this year. Related Reading: Bitcoin All-Time High Propels It Past Amazon, Google To 5th Place Among Global Assets With the WSJ Dollar Index down more than 10% from its January peak and CFTC data showing the biggest speculative short position since mid-2023, investors are casting around for alternatives to sovereign paper. Macro guru Raoul Pal said: “Bond yields are going up. Normally that’s not a good thing… But inflation is falling all the time. The story is liquidity. There’s a lack of liquidity in the bond market, and when yields get too high the government’s reaction function is always and in every case to print more money.” Global liquidity dynamics add to the case. Global M2—aggregating the money stock in the US, euro-area, China and Japan—bottomed late last year and has risen 3–4 % year-to-date, according to multiple trackers. Bitcoin price inflections typically lag global-M2 turns by about three months; the current rally arrived almost on schedule. As crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) observed on X, “Dollar goes down, global liquidity rises, BTC goes higher.” For some market veterans, the price action signals a deeper behavioural shift. “We are watching BTC transform from a risk-on asset to a risk-off asset,” Multicoin Capital co-founder Tushar Jain wrote after Wednesday’s bond rout and dollar sell-off. “Today we saw further proof that the government cannot cut the budget deficit. The market reacted by selling US treasuries, selling USD, selling equities, and buying BTC. The transformation is not yet complete. It will take more days like this to convince the market that BTC is a risk off asset. Like most big changes, this will happen slowly and then suddenly,” Jain added.

FIFA’s layer-1 (L1) blockchain will be powered by the Avalanche network’s scalability-focused infrastructure for the association’s five billion fans worldwide. The move comes nearly a month after FIFA announced its initial plans to launch a new network for its blockchain-based collectibles. AvaCloud’s Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility will enable smoother integration with decentralized wallets and applications. Related: Bitcoin hits new all-time high of $109K as trade war tensions ease The move will enable FIFA to deliver “unique digital collectibles and immersive fan experiences, powered by the speed, scalability, and EVM compatibility,” according to Francesco Abbate, CEO of Modex and FIFA Collect. “The decision was based on a rigorous analysis of key factors including performance, security, transaction fees, customizability, and scalability,” Abbate stated in a May 22 announcement shared with Cointelegraph. Related: Bitcoin volatility lowest in 563 days, Hayes predicts $1M BTC by 2028 FIFA Collect begins migration to Avalanche As part of the rollout, FIFA will migrate its NFT marketplace and NFT collection, FIFA Collect, to the new Avalanche-powered FIFA Blockchain. FIFA added that “future plans and business cases are planned but not yet publicly disclosed.” Following the migration, external Algorand-based wallets such as Pera and Defly will no longer be supported. Instead, users will be able to connect to FIFA Collect via MetaMask or other EVM wallets that support WalletConnect.

In a bold (and awesome) step toward mainstream crypto integration, Volatility Shares will officially launch the first-ever 1x XRP Futures ETF , and trade under the ticker $XRPI on Nasdaq. This debut marks a historic first for Ripple’s native token and signals that XRP may finally be stepping into the ETF spotlight long dominated by Bitcoin and Ethereum. “Good signal that there will be demand for this one,” noted Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, pointing to surging interest in crypto-linked investment vehicles. VolatilityShares is launching the first-ever XRP futures ETF tomorrow, ticker $XRPI .. yes there is a 2x XRP already on market (this is first 1x) and it has $120m aum and trades $35m/day. Good signal that there will be demand for this one. pic.twitter.com/rCooyNZgu0 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) May 21, 2025 Here’s what you should know. Inside the XRPI Launch: Structure, Exposure, and Strategy Filed with the U.S. SEC on May 21, the XRPI ETF is part of the Volatility Shares Trust and offers indirect exposure to XRP futures via a wholly-owned Cayman Islands subsidiary. The fund aims to invest at least 80% of its net assets in XRP-linked instruments – providing regulated access to Ripple’s price action without requiring investors to hold the token itself. This 1x product stands out in a space mostly populated by leveraged plays, making it a more measured approach for those seeking XRP exposure without amplified volatility. Because some like playing it safe and there’s nothing wrong about that! The Race for Leverage: XRP’s ETF Wars Heat Up This isn’t the last stop for Volatility Shares. The firm is preparing to roll out a 2x XRP futures ETF, promising double the daily price appreciation of XRP via leveraged exposure. Teucrium Investment Advisors launched its 2x leveraged XRP ETF ($XXRP) on April 8 , drawing $5.43 million in debut volume and now boasting $120 million in AUM with $35 million in daily trading volume. The demand is clear AND growing. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple Doubles Its Bid to $11B to Acquire Circle — But Coinbase Wants In Too! , All Eyes on XRP The timing couldn’t be better.

Obchakevich said the latest rally “will strengthen confidence in Bitcoin and lead to new injections into the crypto market.” The surge came as Bitcoin set a new all-time high and traded above $110,000, which Obchavich said will “attract new investors to large funds.” Obchakevich noted that institutional players continue to expand their role in the digital asset space: “In May, BlackRock became the second largest bitcoin holder after Satoshi Nakamoto, surpassing Binance in this indicator.” Hassan Khan, the CEO of Bitcoin liquidity platform Ordeez, told Cointelegraph that “this is a structural change.” He explained that “Bitcoin is no longer simply a hedge, it’s in the process of becoming a benchmark currency.” Related: Bitcoin ‘looks exhausted’ as next bear market yields $69K target The crypto market approaches new highs According to CoinMarketCap data , the total cryptocurrency market cap stood at $3.49 trillion at the time of writing.

Looking into the future, Obchakevich shared his view on Bitcoin’s direction: “We are moving gradually towards $200,000, with gradual adjustments. I am sure that this year we will see Bitcoin at $150,000 and $90,000.“ Khan said that “large net inflows to ETFs and increasing open interest demonstrate that institutional confidence is growing.” Looking forward, he said: “Short term profit taking and macro rate uncertainty are tempering momentum. But below-the-surface metrics point to continued high conviction. The foundation is more solid than in any other cycle before it.“ Related: BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF notches 2-week high inflow as BTC nears $112K Today is a special day for Bitcoin Today, May 22, is “Bitcoin Pizza Day,” a recurrence commemorating May 22, 2010, when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz made the first documented purchase of goods using Bitcoin , paying 10,000 BTC for two Papa John’s pizzas. “What was once considered a highly speculative risk has evolved into a serious asset class,” said Ulli Spankowski, chief digital officer at Boerse Stuttgart Group.

2025-05-22T10:38:07.000Z,"Bitcoin (BTC) Runs From Record to Record Again, Analysis Firm Announces Price Target!","The leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) surpassed its previous ATH for the first time yesterday after a difficult 4 months and reached a new ATH. Bitcoin continues to break records, rising above $111,000 in the morning hours. While it is stated that the new record in BTC is due to the increasing interest of institutional investors, the rally is expected to continue. At this point, Presto Research analyst Min Jung said that Bitcoin’s recent rise above $111,000 was largely driven by institutional accumulation, with major firms such as Strategy, Metaplanet, and Twenty One Capital making the biggest contributions. Jung noted that this cycle is different from other bull cycles, arguing that this cycle is driven by long-term institutional capital, unlike previous bull runs that were dominated by retail speculation. Despite the new records, the bull run is still in its early stages, Jung said, adding that the current uptrend is a sign of broader institutional adoption and he expects the rally to continue. “Bitcoin’s surge above $111,000 is driven primarily by treasury holdings from firms like Strategy, Metaplanet, and Twenty One Capital. “Unlike previous bull runs, this rally appears to be fueled by institutional and long-term capital rather than retail speculation.” Jung finally added that they expect Bitcoin to reach $210,000 by the end of 2025.

With sentiment largely bullish, the potential for the benchmark digital asset to go parabolic in coming weeks and months has analysts pointing to what could be the key levels to watch. This outlook has drawn the market’s attention to Bitcoin Pepe – the cryptocurrency that looks set to derive momentum from BTC and SOL. Bulls target gains as Bitcoin price hits $111k Standard Chartered recently forecast Bitcoin’s value will reach $500k or higher in the next four years. Notably, the bank’s analysts see BTC skyrocketing amid institutional adoption and US support for crypto. Continued demand as shown via spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) add to this outlook. On Wednesday, May 21, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas pointed to BlackRock’s IBIT ETF and its inflows. Eric Balchunas @EricBalchunas · Follow $IBIT is going to post its 2nd biggest volume day ever today (outside chance it ends with most). Classic feeding frenzy in effect, new ATHs will do that, eg last time traded this much was 1/23 (last ATH). All the btc ETFs are elevated, most gonna see 2x their average.

Indeed Bitcoin’s surge to a new ATH above $111k comes as the market celebrates the famous ‘Bitcoin Pizza Day.’ Pizza Day represents the day developer Laszlo Hanyecz bought two pizzas for 10,000 BTC. It is now 15 years since and the Bitcoin price has exploded from nearly zero to over $111k . Hanyecz’ BTC could be worth over $1.1 billion today. CyptoQuant says the 10k BTC for pizza was a high price. However, it is what helped turn Bitcoin into a payment option. Growth has been relentless since. Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which adopted Bitcoin as a treasury asset in 2020, has since acquired a staggering $40 billion worth of the coin. In the short five years, the company’s BTC portfolio has an unrealised profit that currently stands at more than $23.8 billion. The question is – does Bitcoin price still have room to go up from here? Most analysts are bullish. Is Bitcoin Pepe worth a look as BTC rallies? Altcoins are retesting some critical levels as top coins such as Ethereum (ETH), XRP (XRP) and Solana (SOL) consolidate amid potentially rising risk asset markets ride broader tailwinds. This is as Bitcoin sees institutional interest mount. On May 21, as BTC spiked to a new ATH, Strategy founder Michael Saylor said buying at the top will still be profitable when price doubles and even triples from there. Investors looking to ride this bull market potential are thus eyeing likely gems.

While not similar to previous cycles, there is the acknowledgement that capital will rotate as inflows hit record highs. That means increased interest. Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP), going live on exchanges soon, could be the best memecoin to ride this sentiment. It’s the first meme layer 2 on Bitcoin, a project that eyes Bitcoin’s $2 trillion market. Combining memecoins, BTC and Solana makes Bitcoin Pepe stand out from the crowd. Ahead of its market debut, Bitcoin Pepe’s presale has smashed past $10 million in early bids. Meanwhile, the project has demonstrated its potential for traction with multiple key strategic partnerships, including with Super Meme, Catamoto and Plena Finance. Upcoming market debut, partnerships and roadmap milestones as well as BTC forecast combine to strengthen BPEP’s bullish outlook. With 9 days to go before the Bitcoin Pepe presale ends on May 31,2025, this might be the best time to buy this altcoin. Currently, the BPEP token is available at a hugely discounted price of $0.0359.

2025-05-22T10:32:32.000Z,"Crypto Confidence Returns: Bitcoin Hits New Peak Above $110,000","Bitcoin price reclaimed a bullish edge this week, topping $111,000 for the first time in its history and rallying more than 33% over the past month. The surge reflects institutional demand, ETF inflows, and growing confidence in U.S. regulatory clarity. Inflows into U.S. Bitcoin ETFs alone surpassed $3.6 billion in May, their largest monthly total since January, while Bitcoin briefly touched $111,816 during Asian trading on May 22, 2025. At the same time, the U.S. Senate moved forward on the bipartisan GENIUS Act, a stablecoin regulation bill analysts say could expand the market from $248 billion today to $2.5 trillion by 2030. Traders are now pricing in targets between $125,000 and $300,000 by late June. Bitcoin Price Hits New ATH Bitcoin price jumped as much as 2.2% to $111,492 in early Asian trading on May 22, 2025, before settling slightly lower. The rally sent Bitcoin’s one-month gain to over 33%, reversing a 25% correction from its January high above $100,000. BTC/USDT Chart| Source: TradingView Ethereum rose 4.5% to $2,619, and Solana climbed 1.9% to $176, underscoring a broad crypto upswing. According to FundFlows data, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs drew more than $3.6 billion in new capital this month, their largest inflow since January 2025. Strategy, the largest publicly traded Bitcoin holder, boosted its position by over $50 billion this quarter, reinforcing a trend of corporate accumulation. Twenty-One Capital, backed by Cantor Fitzgerald and SoftBank, also announced significant Bitcoin purchases, mirroring Strategy’s model. On May 20, 2025, the U.S. Senate passed a procedural vote on the GENIUS Act, a bipartisan bill to regulate dollar-pegged stablecoins. Market participants view the legislation as a critical step toward clearer rules and reduced legal uncertainty for crypto firms. Under the new framework, Standard Chartered projects stablecoin market growth to $2.5 trillion by 2030, up from $248 billion today. Options Market Sentiment Deribit data show peak open interest around the $110,000, $120,000, and $300,000 strike prices for contracts expiring June 27, indicating traders expect further gains. Options traders now forecast a rally to $120,000 by month-end, with bullish positions swamping bearish bets. Analysts at Deutsche Bank note that easing U.S.-China trade tensions and a softer dollar have reinforced Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge. Tony Sycamore of IG Markets described the January–April pullback—from above $100,000 to below $75,000—as a healthy correction within a longer uptrend. Bloomberg reported that growing bipartisan support in Congress for crypto regulation underpins renewed institutional interest. Bitcoin’s ascent above $111,000 underscores that market sentiment now hinges as much on policy and institutional flows as on macroeconomic trends . The convergence of ETF inflows, corporate purchases, and stablecoin legislation has reignited investor confidence. As the GENIUS Act progresses and options markets price in even higher targets, traders and investors alike will watch to see if Bitcoin can sustain its momentum and reassert its role as a leading digital asset. BTC is currently trading at $110,480 after a slight correction from new ATH, according to CoinGecko data.

Source: Coin360 Let’s look at the factors driving crypto prices up today. Crypto prices buoyed by Bitcoin’s new all-time highs Today’s gains were led by Bitcoin ( BTC ), which broke through $111,000 for the first time on May 22, setting a fresh all-time high , as market sentiment continues to improve after last month's tariff-induced sell-off . Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows BTC rose as much as 7.3% to a new record high of $111,888 on May 22 from a low of $104,200 on May 21, lifting the broader crypto market with it. Major altcoins like Ether ( ETH ), Cardano ( ADA ), and Solana ( SOL ) followed Bitcoin’s lead and flashed green, as shown in the chart below. 24-hour market performance of top 10 cryptocurrencies, May 22. Source: CoinMarketCap The performance comes from easing trade tension between the United States and China and Moody's downgrading the US debt rating . This has prompted investors to turn to Bitcoin as a store of value , boosting overall crypto market sentiment. Additionally, the US Dollar Index (DXY) has been on a downtrend since early November and is down more than 9.84% to 99.096 from its Jan. 13 peak of 110.17. The DXY has dropped more than 2.6% over the last 10 days. DXY daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView Crypto market participants often point to increased involvement from traditional financial firms as a reason for crypto gains. This week, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said that the bank will offer clients access to Bitcoin after years of skepticism. Massive short liquidations fuel price surge Another driver of today’s rally is a wave of short liquidations that have triggered a powerful short squeeze, as data from CoinGlass shows. In the past 24 hours, over $495 million in crypto positions have been liquidated across the crypto market, with approximately $300 million representing short position liquidations. Short BTC leveraged positions totaling $173 million have also been liquidated on the day. Total crypto liquidations. Source: CoinGlass The largest single liquidation occurred on Bybit, where a BTC/USD position worth $6.36 million was liquidated. The magnitude of this liquidation mirrors the Nov. 6 liquidation event, where more than $426 million in short leveraged positions were liquidated, accompanying a 16% increase ($356 billion) in the total crypto market capitalization on the same day. The short squeeze has played a crucial role in amplifying the current rally, particularly for Bitcoin, which has led the market with its charge past $110,000. Related: Bitcoin 'looks exhausted' as next bear market yields $69K target Total market cap validates bull flag TOTAL — the combined market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies — confirmed a bull flag pattern on May 20, when it breached the upper boundary of the flag in the weekly timeframe at $3.27 trillion, coinciding with the 50 simple moving average (SMA). TOTAL is currently testing the resistance level at the $3.5 trillion psychological level, as shown in the chart below. A high volume move above this level could accelerate the recent bullish momentum toward the technical target of the prevailing chary pattern at $3.84 trillion — a 17% ascent from the current level.

Conversely, a four-hour candlestick close below $3.35 trillion will likely push the price to test the upper boundary of the flag at $3.27 trillion. Losing this support will invalidate the bullish thesis, and TOTAL could continue its consolidation within the flag for a few more days.

2025-05-22T10:26:00.000Z,"Bitcoin Eyes $120K: Spot ETFs and Institutional Inflows Are Reshaping BTC’s Trajectory","Bitcoin (BTC) has entered uncharted territory, smashing through its previous all-time high (ATH) to near $112,000 on May 22. While casual observers may chalk up this rally to the typical retail-fueled frenzies of past bull runs, analysts at Santiment are saying BTC’s current climb is being shaped by disciplined accumulation from institutional whales, and it may be just the beginning. The experts are projecting a near-term target of $115,000 to $120,000 as the number one cryptocurrency transforms from a speculative asset to a cornerstone of institutional portfolios. Institutional Tsunami Reshaping Bitcoin’s Market Structure On May 21, with BTC at around $109,500, Santiment noted that the cryptocurrency’s surge past its previous ATH of $109,241, set on the day Donald Trump was inaugurated as U.S. president, came amid surprisingly low FOMO among retail traders. Ironically, this lack of retail hype may have cleared the runway for institutional capital to steadily push prices higher without the volatility often seen in retail-driven runs. “One of the key drivers behind Bitcoin’s ascent has been a growing wave of institutional investments,” wrote Santiment, highlighting how easing macro tensions and six straight days of inflows into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) helped push BTC to a record high. At the center of this institutional frenzy is BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT. As of May 22, it holds 636,120 BTC, 2,000 more than the combined holdings of the next 14 biggest U.S. spot ETFs . The fund has become the preferred vehicle for heavyweight investors, with recent SEC filings showing that Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund Mubadala and hedge fund Citadel have significantly expanded their stakes. However, this meteoric rise also poses questions about long-term market structure, with an analysis by CryptoQuant showing that IBIT’s size is creating a monopoly-like concentration that could squeeze out smaller issuers. Meanwhile, corporate accumulators like Michael Saylor’s Strategy and Japan’s Metaplanet are still buying aggressively, with the two firms recently splashing $764 million and $104 million respectively to stack up their holdings. Clear Runway to $120K Technically, Bitcoin is now deep in price discovery mode . Over the past 30 days, it has gained 25.5%, and is up 58.7% year-over-year. With its price hovering around $110,915 at the time of writing, the asset has pumped more than 47% since its April 7 crash to $75,000. According to Santiment, the growing presence of the flagship crypto asset in traditional financial frameworks is changing its perception and giving it new status as a mainstream store of value. In their estimation, investor sentiment and market dynamics could soon push BTC to fresh highs. “Depending on the crowd’s own greed, we could see $115K-$120k in the near future,” the platform tweeted. Additionally, market watchers think that with search interest and social chatter about Bitcoin at bear market lows, the divergence between price action and public enthusiasm could make the cryptocurrency’s current rally more sustainable than those before, especially with institutional whales in control.

2025-05-22T10:21:18.000Z,"Can ChatGPT-powered AI agents really trade crypto for you?","Key takeaways ChatGPT-powered AI agents automate trading tasks using natural language prompts and API integrations, improving speed and consistency. Successes occur when ChatGPT is used as a support tool, not a fully autonomous trading system. Failures happen when traders over-rely on ChatGPT without real-time data, proper risk management or manual oversight. Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance. What if a crypto trader didn’t need to constantly check charts, worry about emotions, or stay up all night watching for sudden price swings? What if those tasks could be handled by an intelligent agent that understands instructions in plain English — and reacts within milliseconds? That’s where ChatGPT-powered AI agents come in. These tools combine natural language processing with real-time trading logic to automate decision-making in one of the world’s most volatile markets. From rebalancing portfolios to reacting to market sentiment, ChatGPT is being adapted to act as a trading assistant, risk manager and market analyst — all rolled into one. But can it truly match or even outperform human intuition? This article explores how far these agents have come, where they shine and where they still fall short. How ChatGPT-powered AI agents operate in cryptocurrency markets ChatGPT-powered AI agents are changing how people interact with crypto markets. These tools combine ChatGPT’s language abilities with external trading tools and APIs to help users monitor prices, understand trends and even place trades automatically. Instead of just reacting to charts or numbers, ChatGPT can understand plain language commands like “Buy Ethereum if the price drops below $2,000” or “Sell Bitcoin if RSI goes above 70.” These AI trading assistants can work with major platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, OKX and other centralized or decentralized exchanges and can also tap into decentralized finance (DeFi) tools and smart contracts . With the right setup, ChatGPT can help automate trading strategies based on both technical data and market news. Success stories vs. failures in ChatGPT-powered crypto trading Some traders have used ChatGPT to assist in automating parts of their crypto trading processes, particularly for strategy generation and sentiment analysis . For example, a user shared on Reddit that they used a ChatGPT-based AI agent for technical analysis on Ether ( ETH ), feeding it four-hour and daily chart screenshots. By interpreting market sentiment, support and resistance zones, and other indicators, they managed to make $6,500 in profits. Similarly, in the broader crypto sector, ChatGPT has been applied to support project development activities such as drafting white papers and marketing content. A notable example is the launch of the “TURBO” memecoin, which reportedly reached a market capitalization of over $50 million in 2024. In this case, ChatGPT was used to streamline documentation and communication rather than manage trading activity, illustrating its usefulness as a support tool in crypto-related initiatives. However, limitations are evident when ChatGPT is applied beyond its core design. While ChatGPT could suggest a trading portfolio and explain its reasoning clearly, it lacks access to real-time market data and couldn’t respond to sudden volatility. In one instance, ChatGPT was allocated $100 across multiple tokens but failed to actively manage the portfolio as prices fluctuated. This resulted in missed opportunities and underperformance compared to dynamic algorithmic strategies. Individual experiences reinforce these observations. A Redditor exposed a scam where a YouTuber promoted a “ChatGPT trading bot” tutorial that led users to deploy malicious smart contracts. The contracts, generated using ChatGPT and passed off as safe, were designed to drain user wallets once funded. Victims collectively lost $17,240 in ETH, highlighting the danger of blindly trusting AI-generated code without proper auditing. Even when asked, “If I use ChatGPT to build an AI agent for crypto trading, can I become a millionaire?” ChatGPT responded with a realistic outlook — acknowledging that while it’s possible, success depends on having a profitable strategy, disciplined risk management, and the ability to scale effectively. Here is ChatGPT’s response: These cases suggest that while ChatGPT can support certain elements of the trading process, it should not be treated as a standalone solution for autonomous crypto trading. AI in crypto trading: Key benefits and limitations AI tools like ChatGPT are increasingly being integrated into crypto trading workflows to improve speed, accuracy and efficiency. While they offer important advantages, they also carry specific limitations that traders must actively manage. Below are the main benefits and challenges: Key benefits of using AI for crypto trading AI bots can execute trades in milliseconds, crucial for capturing opportunities in fast-moving crypto markets. Bots follow pre-programmed rules precisely, eliminating emotional biases that often affect human traders. Crypto markets are always open, and AI bots can monitor and act around the clock without interruption. A single bot can manage multiple trading pairs, exchanges and strategies simultaneously. ChatGPT can understand specific prompts like “Rebalance every Monday” or “Set stop-loss at 5%,” allowing flexible automation. Limitations of ChatGPT in cryptocurrency trading ChatGPT does not access live market data unless specifically integrated with external APIs (e.g., TradingView, CoinMarketCap or exchange websockets). Instructions must be clear and unambiguous; ChatGPT may misinterpret vague or complex commands. Improperly secured API keys or lack of two-factor authentication (2FA) can expose trading accounts to unauthorized access. ChatGPT’s cloud-based infrastructure can introduce latency, which could impact performance during highly volatile periods. ChatGPT does not monitor regional compliance rules; users must manually enforce trading limits based on local regulations. Ethical and regulatory implications of AI in crypto trading As AI becomes more integrated into trading systems, it raises significant ethical and regulatory concerns that stakeholders across the financial sector are beginning to address. Accountability: If an AI agent executes a harmful or unlawful trade, questions arise around legal responsibility. It remains unclear in many jurisdictions whether liability falls primarily on the developer, the trader using the AI system or the platform facilitating the transactions. Market manipulation risks: Autonomous AI bots could unintentionally engage in activities such as spoofing (placing and canceling fake orders to mislead the market) or wash trading (creating artificial volume), especially if not properly programmed with compliance safeguards. Regulatory oversight: Financial authorities, including the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the European Securities and Markets Authority, are actively studying the implications of AI and algorithmic trading. These agencies have recognized that traditional trading regulations may not fully account for autonomous decision-making by AI systems. Policy developments: In January 2024, the European Commission released updates to its Digital Finance Strategy, which included references to AI-based financial services. While not yet finalized, these draft regulations under the broader Digital Finance Package signal a move toward stricter compliance expectations for firms deploying AI in financial markets. Meanwhile, ethical crypto platforms are beginning to voluntarily disclose the use of trading bots in their systems. In parallel, open-source communities are advocating for clearer audit trails, improved model transparency and the establishment of ethical guidelines for AI applications in finance to ensure accountability and fairness.

But this time, something feels different. While Cardano price prediction experts remain hopeful, a growing number of analysts are shifting their focus to a rising star with jaw-dropping potential: Bitcoin Solaris. It’s not just another altcoin—it’s being positioned as the crypto most likely to repeat Bitcoin’s historic millionaire-making trajectory. What About Cardano? Cardano has long been celebrated for its academic roots and slow-but-steady development strategy. Its strong fundamentals and loyal community make it a solid hold, but not necessarily the most explosive opportunity. While ADA continues to show stability, it’s missing one thing: early-stage investor advantage. That’s where Bitcoin Solaris steps in. Universal Mining: Everyone Can Now Earn Crypto One of Bitcoin Solaris’s greatest breakthroughs lies in its Universal Mining model. Traditional mining was once reserved for experts with deep pockets and advanced rigs. But now, even a basic smartphone or laptop can mine BTC-S effortlessly.

Tap-and-earn: One-click mining via the upcoming Solaris Nova App. Adaptive algorithm: Tailors mining output to your hardware automatically. Energy-efficient: Uses 99.95% less power than conventional mining. Built-in wallet: Store your BTC-S directly inside the app. Global reach: If you have internet, you can mine. While only some community members currently have access to the Solaris Nova App beta, there’s still time to join before the official release. This frictionless approach to mining is what makes Bitcoin Solaris stand out—it’s simple, scalable, and perfect for the masses. Presale Traction: Bitcoin Solaris Gains Momentum Current Price: $4 Next Phase: $5 Launch Price: $20 Bonus: 12% Beyond the numbers, the momentum is real. With over $1.2 million raised and just 90 days to run, the Bitcoin Solaris presale is shaping up to be one of the most explosive early-stage launches of the year. More than 8,900 users have already joined ahead of the July 31, 2025 launch, locking in their spot before prices surge. Why Work for Money When BTC-S Can Work for You? To ensure investor trust, Bitcoin Solaris backs its growth with strong security credentials: Fully audited by Cyberscope Fully audited by Freshcoins Verified KYC compliance In a market full of uncertainty, BTC-S is proving it’s built on transparency—not hype. Analysts and Influencers Join the Chorus As more experts take notice, Bitcoin Solaris is quickly gaining visibility. Influencer reviews are starting to flood in, with Crypto Nitro calling it one of the most exciting mobile mining plays to date. These aren’t just empty endorsements—analysts are highlighting real utility, real momentum, and an engaged, expanding community. And speaking of community, Bitcoin Solaris has built a loyal presence across platforms. The Telegram channel and X page are where early supporters gather, share updates, and track the presale’s surge in real time. For anyone looking to stay ahead of the curve, those platforms are essential. Referral Program: Double the Rewards To fuel its organic growth, Bitcoin Solaris has introduced a double rewards referral program. When you refer someone, you earn 5% in BTC-S tokens, and they get a 5% token bonus on their purchase. It’s a win-win model that incentivizes the kind of viral expansion seen in early Bitcoin days—only this time, it’s structured and trackable via each user’s dashboard. Final Thoughts: This Might Be Your Moment The truth is, very few altcoins ever present a chance this big. Bitcoin Solaris is combining universal mining, mass adoption tools, and presale momentum in a way that feels eerily familiar to Bitcoin’s early years.

This event occurs as XRP continues to display growing momentum both on-chain and in market activity, despite years of subdued performance due to regulatory overhang. A golden cross is defined in technical analysis as the point at which a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average, typically interpreted as a potential shift from a bearish to a bullish trend. In this instance, XRP’s 50-week moving average has moved above the 200-week moving average against Bitcoin. It’s the first time this crossover has occurred for the XRP/BTC trading pair, and it suggests a possible reversal in the relative underperformance XRP has experienced since late 2020. Potential Implications for XRP Price Performance This formation is attracting attention because it follows nearly four years of sideways movement in the XRP/BTC ratio, a period during which XRP was largely unable to capitalize on broader market rallies due to its legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Now, with more clarity surrounding Ripple’s position and increasing on-chain activity, the market is reassessing XRP’s relative valuation. Some market participants see this technical shift as a sign that XRP may outperform Bitcoin in the coming months, particularly as altcoin markets gradually recover and investors begin rotating capital outside Bitcoin. The move is seen as particularly notable because most altcoins are still trailing Bitcoin in terms of year-to-date performance.

According to Messari’s “State of XRP Ledger Q1 2025” report, XRP’s circulating market capitalization rose by 2% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ), contrasting with a combined 22% decline across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. On a year-over-year (YoY) basis, XRP’s market cap surged by 252%, growing from $34.6 billion at the end of Q1 2024. Other key metrics also reflected sustained momentum. Daily active addresses increased by 142% QoQ to reach 134,600. The number of new addresses rose by 12% from the previous quarter, totaling 568,300, a 210% increase from the same period a year ago. Notably, the number of receiver addresses on the XRP Ledger continued to exceed sender addresses for the fourth consecutive quarter, signaling an expanding base of transaction participants. Daily average receiver addresses climbed by 168% to 127,800, while average daily senders grew by 14.5%, reaching 34,300. XRP’s first-ever golden cross against Bitcoin on the weekly chart, coupled with positive growth across its core network metrics, may mark a turning point in its long-term trajectory. As technical indicators and adoption metrics align, investor sentiment toward XRP appears to be improving, potentially positioning the asset for stronger relative performance in the broader crypto market.

2025-05-22T10:02:14.000Z,"Berkshire Hathaway in danger as Japanese bonds crash, but Warren Buffett still won’t touch Bitcoin that’s making new ATHs","Berkshire Hathaway is in deep trouble as Japan’s bond market unravels, and Warren Buffett refuses to even glance at Bitcoin, which just crossed a record-breaking $111,000. The current historic surge in Japanese bond yields is threatening to blow up the exact strategy Warren used to justify his billion-dollar bets on Japan’s five major trading houses. While global investors are flooding into crypto and banking record profits, Warren is doing the exact opposite—selling off his only crypto exposure and doubling down on a play that’s now bleeding from all sides. Warren raised ¥281.8 billion in October 2024, then followed up with a much smaller ¥90 billion in April 2025 through yen-denominated bonds. Those funds were used to build positions close to 10% in Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Itochu, Marubeni, and Sumitomo. It worked at first. Borrow at 0.5% interest, buy stocks paying ~5% in dividends. Easy cash. But now, as Japan’s bond yields rise fast, that carry trade strategy is getting torched. New bond issues cost more. The interest spread shrinks. The profit vanishes. Japanese stocks drop as yields kill equity valuations Shares of the five trading houses aren’t holding up either. In 2025 alone, Mitsui’s down 20%, Itochu has lost 16%, and the rest are sliding. Higher yields usually signal tighter policy, and tighter policy kills equity valuations—especially ones built on stable dividends. Berkshire’s portfolio in Japan is loaded with those. The damage gets worse when you factor in the trade tensions triggered by Donald Trump’s latest tariffs, which rattled Japanese markets earlier this year and forced companies like Asahi and Suntory to walk away from bond deals completely. Berkshire didn’t back out, but the ¥90 billion bond it issued this April was the company’s smallest ever. That’s not a flex. That’s caution. The situation’s turning so fast that the same assets Warren called “long-term holdings” are now dipping below what he paid. And while he’s always claimed to like cheap stocks, these ones might get cheaper than he’s willing to admit. Currency swings and bond pressure weaken Berkshire’s hedge There’s another issue Berkshire can’t dodge: the yen. The company’s bonds and dividends are all yen-based, which was supposed to act as a hedge. If the yen dropped, Berkshire’s debt would be easier to repay. That hedge only works when the yen stays weak. But in July 2024, when the Bank of Japan surprised markets with a rate hike, the yen got stronger, fast. If yields keep going up, the yen could climb again. That turns the hedge against Warren. It slashes the dollar value of dividends, hurts returns, and messes with the company’s ability to balance its foreign books. Still, despite the rising risks, Warren’s been stubborn. He hasn’t sold his Japanese positions. He hasn’t moved away from the bond strategy. And he sure ain’t touching Bitcoin, which just set back-to-back all-time highs this week. That’s after Berkshire dumped its entire stake in Nu Holdings, the Brazilian fintech firm behind crypto-friendly Nubank. Bitcoin explodes after Warren exits Nubank and ditches crypto Warren’s firm closed out of Nubank in Q1 2025, walking away with $250 million in profit. That move officially ended Berkshire’s one and only link to crypto. While Warren was cashing out, Bitcoin surged to $109,800, then jumped again to $111,762 on Wednesday, fueled by renewed institutional interest and support for the GENIUS Act in the Senate. That bill lays out new rules for stablecoins and has been a major boost for confidence in the space. Traders also took advantage of the momentum, with over $900 million in short positions liquidated, based on data from CoinGlass. Ethereum, XRP, and Solana all followed Bitcoin’s lead, climbing as the crypto market roared. Meanwhile, Berkshire boosted its cash pile to $347.8 billion, mostly held in US Treasurys, after also unloading shares of Citigroup and Bank of America. Warren once called Bitcoin “rat poison squared,” and it doesn’t look like his opinion has evolved. Despite the rally, despite the regulation, despite even Jamie Dimon, longtime Bitcoin skeptic and JPMorgan CEO, telling clients they can now buy the coin through the bank, Warren hasn’t budged. At Berkshire’s latest shareholder meeting, an attendee named Jackie Han asked about the company’s take on real estate. Warren laughed and said if he had to pick between real estate and stocks for life, he’d go with stocks every time. “There’s just so much more opportunity, at least in the United States, that presents itself in the security market than in real estate,” Warren said.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/berkshire-hathaway-in-danger-as-bonds-crash/,"ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET","OP-ED|Berkshire Hathaway|BoJ|BTC|JPY|USD",cryptocompare

2025-05-22T10:21:18.000Z,"Can ChatGPT-powered AI agents really trade crypto for you?","Key takeawaysChatGPT-powered AI agents automate trading tasks using natural language prompts and API integrations, improving speed and consistency.Successes occur when ChatGPT is used as a support tool, not a fully autonomous trading system.Failures happen when traders over-rely on ChatGPT without real-time data, proper risk management or manual oversight.Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance.What if a crypto trader didn’t need to constantly check charts, worry about emotions, or stay up all night watching for sudden price swings? What if those tasks could be handled by an intelligent agent that understands instructions in plain English — and reacts within milliseconds? That’s where ChatGPT-powered AI agents come in.These tools combine natural language processing with real-time trading logic to automate decision-making in one of the world’s most volatile markets. From rebalancing portfolios to reacting to market sentiment, ChatGPT is being adapted to act as a trading assistant, risk manager and market analyst — all rolled into one. But can it truly match or even outperform human intuition? This article explores how far these agents have come, where they shine and where they still fall short.How ChatGPT-powered AI agents operate in cryptocurrency marketsChatGPT-powered AI agents are changing how people interact with crypto markets. These tools combine ChatGPT’s language abilities with external trading tools and APIs to help users monitor prices, understand trends and even place trades automatically. Instead of just reacting to charts or numbers, ChatGPT can understand plain language commands like “Buy Ethereum if the price drops below $2,000” or “Sell Bitcoin if RSI goes above 70.”These AI trading assistants can work with major platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, OKX and other centralized or decentralized exchanges and can also tap into decentralized finance (DeFi) tools and smart contracts. With the right setup, ChatGPT can help automate trading strategies based on both technical data and market news.Success stories vs. failures in ChatGPT-powered crypto tradingSome traders have used ChatGPT to assist in automating parts of their crypto trading processes, particularly for strategy generation and sentiment analysis. For example, a user shared on Reddit that they used a ChatGPT-based AI agent for technical analysis on Ether (ETH), feeding it four-hour and daily chart screenshots. By interpreting market sentiment, support and resistance zones, and other indicators, they managed to make $6,500 in profits.Similarly, in the broader crypto sector, ChatGPT has been applied to support project development activities such as drafting white papers and marketing content. A notable example is the launch of the “TURBO” memecoin, which reportedly reached a market capitalization of over $50 million in 2024. In this case, ChatGPT was used to streamline documentation and communication rather than manage trading activity, illustrating its usefulness as a support tool in crypto-related initiatives.However, limitations are evident when ChatGPT is applied beyond its core design. While ChatGPT could suggest a trading portfolio and explain its reasoning clearly, it lacks access to real-time market data and couldn’t respond to sudden volatility. In one instance, ChatGPT was allocated $100 across multiple tokens but failed to actively manage the portfolio as prices fluctuated. This resulted in missed opportunities and underperformance compared to dynamic algorithmic strategies.Individual experiences reinforce these observations. A Redditor exposed a scam where a YouTuber promoted a “ChatGPT trading bot” tutorial that led users to deploy malicious smart contracts. The contracts, generated using ChatGPT and passed off as safe, were designed to drain user wallets once funded. Victims collectively lost $17,240 in ETH, highlighting the danger of blindly trusting AI-generated code without proper auditing.Even when asked, “If I use ChatGPT to build an AI agent for crypto trading, can I become a millionaire?” ChatGPT responded with a realistic outlook — acknowledging that while it’s possible, success depends on having a profitable strategy, disciplined risk management, and the ability to scale effectively.Here is ChatGPT’s response:These cases suggest that while ChatGPT can support certain elements of the trading process, it should not be treated as a standalone solution for autonomous crypto trading.AI in crypto trading: Key benefits and limitationsAI tools like ChatGPT are increasingly being integrated into crypto trading workflows to improve speed, accuracy and efficiency. While they offer important advantages, they also carry specific limitations that traders must actively manage. Below are the main benefits and challenges:Key benefits of using AI for crypto tradingAI bots can execute trades in milliseconds, crucial for capturing opportunities in fast-moving crypto markets.Bots follow pre-programmed rules precisely, eliminating emotional biases that often affect human traders.Crypto markets are always open, and AI bots can monitor and act around the clock without interruption.A single bot can manage multiple trading pairs, exchanges and strategies simultaneously.ChatGPT can understand specific prompts like “Rebalance every Monday” or “Set stop-loss at 5%,” allowing flexible automation.Limitations of ChatGPT in cryptocurrency tradingChatGPT does not access live market data unless specifically integrated with external APIs (e.g., TradingView, CoinMarketCap or exchange websockets).Instructions must be clear and unambiguous; ChatGPT may misinterpret vague or complex commands.Improperly secured API keys or lack of two-factor authentication (2FA) can expose trading accounts to unauthorized access.ChatGPT’s cloud-based infrastructure can introduce latency, which could impact performance during highly volatile periods.ChatGPT does not monitor regional compliance rules; users must manually enforce trading limits based on local regulations.Ethical and regulatory implications of AI in crypto tradingAs AI becomes more integrated into trading systems, it raises significant ethical and regulatory concerns that stakeholders across the financial sector are beginning to address.Accountability: If an AI agent executes a harmful or unlawful trade, questions arise around legal responsibility. It remains unclear in many jurisdictions whether liability falls primarily on the developer, the trader using the AI system or the platform facilitating the transactions.Market manipulation risks: Autonomous AI bots could unintentionally engage in activities such as spoofing (placing and canceling fake orders to mislead the market) or wash trading (creating artificial volume), especially if not properly programmed with compliance safeguards.Regulatory oversight: Financial authorities, including the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the European Securities and Markets Authority, are actively studying the implications of AI and algorithmic trading. These agencies have recognized that traditional trading regulations may not fully account for autonomous decision-making by AI systems.Policy developments: In January 2024, the European Commission released updates to its Digital Finance Strategy, which included references to AI-based financial services. While not yet finalized, these draft regulations under the broader Digital Finance Package signal a move toward stricter compliance expectations for firms deploying AI in financial markets.Meanwhile, ethical crypto platforms are beginning to voluntarily disclose the use of trading bots in their systems. In parallel, open-source communities are advocating for clearer audit trails, improved model transparency and the establishment of ethical guidelines for AI applications in finance to ensure accountability and fairness.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

This forced buying adds upward pressure on prices, often triggering even higher spikes.</p><p>Why Bitcoin Traders (and Investors) Should Care</p><p>These liquidation levels act as magnets or significant pivot points in price action. Let's consider two critical liquidation zones for Bitcoin based on recent data:</p><ul><li><p>Above Current Price: At around $115,549, approximately 3.75k BTC worth of short positions could be liquidated. This forced buying could push prices rapidly higher, creating momentum that attracts additional buyers.</p></li><li><p>Below Current Price: A notable zone between approximately $96,000 and $97,335 shows significant potential liquidations of leveraged long positions. If Bitcoin prices drop into this range, substantial selling could be triggered, rapidly pushing prices lower.</p></li></ul><p>How Liquidations Can Propel BTC Futures Price Further</p><p>When a large liquidation occurs (let's say short liquidation at a higher price), traders holding shorts must rapidly buy Bitcoin at the market price to cover their positions. This buying activity creates immediate upward pressure, potentially triggering additional liquidations of other short sellers, causing prices to spike even higher.</p><p>Moreover, these rapid price movements attract momentum traders, scalpers, and short-term speculators who ride the trend further upwards. However, caution is necessary: significant liquidation points often become attractive levels for larger, savvy traders to take profits. Thus, it's common to witness price spiking above critical liquidation levels, followed by a reversal or at least a retest of previously broken resistance or support.</p><p>Key Trading Guidance for Bitcoin Traders</p><ul><li><p>Do Not Treat Liquidation Levels as Precise Reversal Points: Instead, anticipate potential overshoots. Price often moves beyond these levels due to the aggressive market orders and new entrants drawn by the momentum.</p></li><li><p>Expect Potential Reversals Post-Liquidation Spikes: Often, sharp moves above resistance (or below support) are temporary, leading to a reversal as profit-takers seek new buyers or sellers entering at extreme prices.</p></li><li><p>Stay Alert to Retests: After a liquidation-driven breakout, watch carefully if prices return to test the previously significant level—often a key indicator of the next market direction.</p></li></ul><p>Why Track Whales Specifically?</p><p>While standard liquidation maps provide helpful insights, focusing on whale or large institutional positions offers enhanced predictive value. Large traders typically hold sizable positions with significant market impact. Their liquidation points, therefore, are more likely to trigger noticeable price movements, setting off cascades of secondary liquidations and momentum-driven trades. By tracking these larger positions, traders gain clearer insights into potentially explosive market dynamics and critical price thresholds.</p><p>In summary, understanding liquidation dynamics, especially those involving significant \""whale\"" positions, gives Bitcoin traders a vital edge. Remain vigilant around key liquidation zones, anticipate temporary volatility spikes, and prepare for potential reversals and retests. Trade wisely, understanding that these are guides—not guarantees—of price action.</p><p>Bitcoin Price Outlook</p><p>My current analysis indicates a target range of $117,000 - $119,000 for Bitcoin futures.</p><p>Please note that the above video contains visual information only, as a technical issue is currently being addressed which impacts the audio.

2025-05-22T08:37:57.000Z,"Dubai regulator clarifies real-world asset tokenization rules: Lawyer","Newly updated guidelines from Dubai’s crypto regulator include provisions on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and clarify rules for issuers. On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) released its updated Rulebook for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) operating in the region. The regulator gave market participants until June 19 to comply with the new rules. The regulator previously told Cointelegraph that it had enhanced supervisory mechanisms and brought consistency across activity-based rules. One of the more prominent changes includes regulatory clarity on RWA tokens. Irina Heaver, partner at the United Arab Emirates-based law firm NeosLegal, told Cointelegraph that the updated rules clarify RWA issuance and distribution. “Issuing real-world asset tokens and listing them on secondary markets is no longer theoretical,” Heaver told Cointelegraph. “It’s now a regulatory reality in Dubai and the broader UAE.”A “viable” path to realize RWA hypeHeaver compared RWAs to security token offerings (STOs), an earlier attempt from the crypto space to tokenize securities like stocks, bonds and real estate investment trusts. However, the UAE crypto lawyer said that STOs “died a peaceful death in 2018 to 2019.” The lawyer told Cointelegraph STOs did not work out because of the lack of regulatory clarity, viable secondary market trading venues, institutional investor appetite and liquidity. Still, the situation is different for RWAs. Heaver told Cointelegraph that RWAs are the next foundational layer for institutional adoption of blockchain and virtual assets. Heaver said that VARA’s new rules already cover them as Asset-Referenced Virtual Assets (ARVA) tokens. She said: “VARA’s newly updated Virtual Asset Issuance Rulebook (May 2025) addresses these failures head-on. Regulated exchanges and broker-dealers in Dubai are now authorized to distribute and list ARVA tokens.”The lawyer said this solves an issue in jurisdictions like Switzerland, where token issuance is possible, but listing and secondary trading remain unregulated. Related: Dubai gov’t agencies to link real estate registry with property tokenizationLawyer shares requirements for RWA issuersHeaver said ARVA tokens are defined under Dubai law as representing direct or indirect ownership of real-world assets, granting entitlement to receive or share income and purporting to maintain a stable value by reference to real-world assets or income. ARVA tokens are also backed or collateralised by such real-world assets or constitute a derivative, wrapped, duplicated, or fractionalised version of another ARVA. The lawyer said issuers must meet specific requirements, including a Category 1 Virtual Asset Issuance license, a comprehensive white paper and a risk disclosure statement. In addition, issuers must have a paid-up capital of 1.5 million UAE dirhams (about $408,000) or 2% of reserve assets held. The issuers are also subjected to monthly independent audit obligations and must adhere to ongoing supervisory oversight. “VARA is providing regulatory clarity, and it’s giving the industry a viable, enforceable path to turn the hype of RWA tokenization into reality,” Heaver told Cointelegraph. “This matters because it marks a shift, from theory to execution, from fiction to framework.”Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/dubai-vara-guidelines-rwa-tokenization-clarity?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-22T08:25:00.000Z,"5 red flags you’re being shilled: Don’t buy the hype","What is shilling in crypto?              At its core, shilling is the act of artificially promoting a cryptocurrency or token, often with exaggerated claims, to increase its price or popularity. But what’s the goal? Hype it up, get others to buy in, and then cash out, leaving latecomers holding the bag.Shilling can come from anyone: influencers, anonymous accounts or even high-profile figures with political or financial clout. The common thread is manipulation: It’s not about educating you or building real value but pumping hype for personal gain.Unfortunately, the line between enthusiastic promotion and outright deception can be thin, and many fall victim without realizing it. That’s why it’s critical to learn how to spot the signs early.                  5 red flags you’re being shilled              Beware of crypto red flags like overhyped promises, anonymous teams, influencer shills, missing products and FOMO tactics — if it smells like a scam, it probably is.1. Overhyped promises You’ve probably seen posts that scream:“100x potential!”“Guaranteed returns!”“This is your ticket to financial freedom!”These are classic shill tactics. Real, credible projects don’t promise life-changing profits. Why? Because there are no guarantees in crypto or in any investment.When a project leads with grandiose financial claims rather than actual product value or utility, it’s likely a ploy to stir FOMO and attract unsuspecting investors. The truth is, if something sounds too good to be true, it almost always is.Remember: The bigger the promise, the bigger the red flag.2. Anonymous or suspicious teams In crypto, anonymity isn’t always bad, but when you’re trusting people with your money, transparency matters.It’s a major red flag when a project has:No identifiable team membersFake names or aliasesStock photos on its websiteNo LinkedIn or professional history.The simple rule is “No face, no funds.”Scammers often hide behind anonymity because they know they’ll eventually vanish and there’ll be no one to hold accountable. Even worse, some use fabricated credentials or hire actors to pose as team members.Before investing, check whether the founders or developers have any verifiable history. Do they have prior experience in blockchain or startups? Have they launched anything successful before?3. Influencer spam and paid promotions One day, no one’s talking about a particular coin — the next, your feed is flooded with influencers hyping it up. Sound familiar?This sudden burst of attention is often coordinated with a paid promotion campaign disguised as “genuine enthusiasm.”Many influencers fail to disclose sponsorships, even though it’s required by law in many countries. The US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have cracked down on this in recent years.Take, for example:Kim Kardashian, who was fined $1.26 million in 2022 for promoting EthereumMax without proper disclosure.Floyd Mayweather Jr., who was sued for endorsing the same project at a paid event.BitBoy (Ben Armstrong), who faced legal action in multiple lawsuits for promoting scam tokens to his audience.If you notice multiple influencers promoting the same project in a short time, especially without using labels like #ad or #sponsored, it’s a strong indicator of a shill campaign.Don’t mistake volume for value. Hype doesn’t equal legitimacy.4. No real product or roadmapIf you visit the project’s website, it looks sleek, maybe even impressive. But where’s the product? Where’s the code?Shilled tokens often rely on flashy marketing but have no working application, no GitHub code and no actual use case. Everything is either “coming soon” or buried behind vague promises.Ask yourself:Can I use the platform or app today?Is there a white paper that makes sense?Do they have public repositories or open development?If all you’re seeing is a landing page and a vague roadmap that’s been “coming soon” for months, that’s a major red flag.5. Pressure tactics and FOMO Time pressure is a psychological weapon, and shillers know how to use it.Watch out for lines such as:“Presale ends in 2 hours!”“Only 1,000 spots left!”“If you don’t buy now, you’ll miss out forever!”These tactics prey on your fear of missing out (FOMO) and push you into making impulsive decisions without research.But crypto isn’t a sprint; it’s a long-term game. Anyone trying to rush you into buying likely has something to hide. Solid investments don’t need fake urgency.Take a breath, step back, and ask yourself: Am I buying because I believe in this project or because I’m being manipulated?Did you know? The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) secured a $128-million judgment against Ryan Mitchell Pope, Daniel Samuel Bishop and their company EmpiresX for operating a fraudulent forex and cryptocurrency investment scheme that defrauded over 12,500 victims.                  Is shilling illegal in crypto? Can influencers be sued?              Shilling isn’t just unethical in many cases — it’s also illegal.In the world of crypto, undisclosed promotions are a major legal risk. If someone is paid to promote a token or project but fails to reveal that financial connection, they could face fines, lawsuits or even criminal charges. This is especially true if the promoted token is later classified as a security under US law.Regulators like the SEC, FTC and CFTC have all cracked down on this behavior. Their targets have included:Influencers who failed to disclose paid promotionsPromoters who misled investors with false claimsIndividuals who ran pump-and-dump schemes using social media.Francier Obando Pinillo, a pastor from Miami, was indicted on 26 fraud counts for running a crypto scam through “Solano Fi,” defrauding investors of millions from 2021 to 2023. He allegedly used his church, social media and false promises of 34.9% monthly returns to lure victims. The platform showed fake gains but blocked withdrawals, while funds were diverted for personal use. Pinillo was arraigned in Richland, Washington and faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.As crypto becomes more mainstream, expect stricter regulations and more consequences for shillers.Did you know? Argentine President Javier Milei has dissolved the special task force investigating the LIBRA cryptocurrency scandal, a project he promoted in February 2025 that surged to a $4.5-billion valuation before crashing by over 97%. The task force, created by Milei himself, was disbanded via Decree 332/2025, citing that it had fulfilled its purpose. However, critics argue that no official findings were released, and judicial investigations into Milei and his associates continue.                  How to protect yourself from shilling scams              Do your own research, verify the team and utility, ignore hype and influencers, and stay alert to pump-and-dump schemes to avoid crypto shilling traps.Let’s understand how you can protect yourself from shilling scams in crypto:Do your own research (DYOR): Always research the project, the team behind it and the data supporting the claims. Don’t rely solely on hype or influencer recommendations. Look into onchain data, GitHub activity and the project’s utility to make informed decisions.Verify the team: A legitimate crypto project should have a transparent and credible team. If the developers are anonymous or have no professional profiles (like LinkedIn), that’s a red flag. Always check the team’s past projects and credibility before investing.Look for real utility: Does this project actually solve a problem? A genuine project should have a working product or solution, not just promises. Avoid projects that lack real-world utility or are still in “coming soon” stages for extended periods.Ignore the hype: If a token is suddenly trending on social media or being aggressively promoted, don’t let FOMO influence your judgment. Shillers often rely on emotions to push their agenda, so it’s essential to evaluate projects based on their merits, not just popularity.Stay skeptical of influencers: Influencers with large followings may be paid to promote certain tokens. Before taking their advice, ask yourself, What’s their incentive? Verify the promotion is legitimate and disclosed as paid or sponsored. Always cross-check the information with independent sources.Watch for pump-and-dump schemes: Be cautious of sudden price spikes followed by rapid drops. These are often signs of pump-and-dump schemes where the token’s value is artificially inflated by coordinated buying and then quickly sold off, leaving investors with losses. Always monitor price trends and be wary of sudden, unexplained increases in value.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/5-red-flags-youre-being-shilled-dont-buy-the-hype?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Seeker is the company’s second-generation device, after the Saga Web3 phone that launched in April 2023. The company unveiled the Seeker phone in September 2024, saying it wouldn’t just be a “memecoin phone.” So far, it has pre-sold 150,000 units.The Solana Seeker has gone through two sale phases: The Founder window, where the price for each device was $450, and the Early Adopter window, where the price per device was $500. Assuming the lower price window, Solana Mobile could generate at least $67.5 million in gross revenue from device sales. For comparison, the iPhone generated $199.3 billion in revenue for Apple in 2024.The new architecture that will govern future Solana Mobile devices is called TEEPIN, which stands for “Trusted Execution Environment Platform Infrastructure Network.” It is a three-layer architecture — hardware, platform, and network layers — that will allow users, developers, and device makers to participate in a trustless environment.Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder and CEO of Solana Labs, called TEEPIN “the next evolution in mobile” and a framework where trust is “verified by cryptography.”In addition, Solana Mobile is planning to launch “SKR,” the native asset of the Solana Mobile ecosystem. \""It transforms the traditional mobile business model by giving stakeholders actual ownership in the platform,” said Emmett Hollyer, general manager at Solana Mobile.

However, a closer look at the data shows a more positive outlook for further price gains.Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.chThe current 7% annualized Bitcoin futures premium is well within the neutral range of 5% to 10%, which has been typical for the past two weeks.

This data supports the idea that derivatives markets were not the main driver of the recent price increases. Moreover, the $1.37 billion in net inflows to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States between May 15 and May 20 further suggests that spot buyers, rather than derivatives traders, were the primary force behind the rally.Despite the lack of conviction in Bitcoin futures, several indicators point to further upside. Forced liquidations of bearish BTC futures positions were relatively low at $170 million between May 18 and May 21, cementing the idea of a spot-driven rally. In comparison, the rally to $104,000 on May 9 triggered $538 million in liquidations over three days.Related: Is Bitcoin price close to a cycle top? — 5 indicators that help traders decideBitcoin options put-to-call ratio at Deribit.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) in the overbought zone indicate that the bulls are in control.

A break below the 20-day EMA will be the first sign that the bulls are booking profits in a hurry.

The ETH/USDT pair is likely to pick up momentum on a break above $2,739. That clears the path for a rally to $3,000.Contrary to this assumption, a break and close below the 20-day EMA signals that the bears are back in the game. The pair could tumble to $2,111, which is likely to attract solid buying by the bulls.XRP price predictionXRP (XRP) has been witnessing a tough battle between the buyers and sellers at the 20-day EMA ($2.35).XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. If the price skids below the 20-day EMA, the XRP/USDT pair may stay inside the $2 to $2.65 range for a while. Instead, if the price turns up sharply from the 20-day EMA and breaks above $2.65, the advantage will tilt in favor of the bulls. The pair could rally to $3 and, after that, to $3.40, where the sellers are expected to mount a strong defense.BNB price predictionBNB (BNB) bulls have held the 20-day EMA ($639) support during the pullback, indicating buying on dips. BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bulls will try to push the price above $693 but are expected to face solid selling by the bears.

That could sink the pair to the 50-day SMA ($609). Solana price predictionSellers failed to pull Solana (SOL) below the 20-day EMA ($164), indicating demand at lower levels.SOL/USDT daily chart.

If they can pull it off, the SOL/USDT pair could accelerate toward the target objective of $210 and then $220.If sellers want to prevent the upside, they will have to quickly tug the price below the 20-day EMA. The pair could slide to $153 and later to the 50-day SMA ($145).

2025-05-21T17:55:00.000Z,"Interest groups, lawmakers to protest Trump&#039;s memecoin dinner","Democratic leaning organizations and members of Congress have announced plans to protest what they describe as the sale of access to the office of the US president, in reference to Donald Trump’s memecoin dinner on May 22. The event’s attendees are said to have collectively spent over $100 million for the chance to meet with the US president.Since Trump’s memecoin project, Official Trump (TRUMP), announced that its top 220 tokenholders would have an opportunity to apply for an exclusive dinner with the president, many leaders in the crypto industry and US lawmakers have criticized the event, saying Trump was opening his office to potential bribery and corruption. The memecoin dinner prompted some Democratic lawmakers to withdraw support for crypto-related legislation in Congress, including the market structure and stablecoin bills.“Trump collecting gifts from foreign governments is unconstitutional,” a spokesperson for the consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen, which is planning to protest near the memecoin dinner on May 22, told Cointelegraph. “Collecting foreign government investments through his memecoin is not much better. American foreign policy should not be for sale.”Source: Public CitizenCrypto industry figures such as Tron founder Justin Sun, Kronos Research chief investment officer Vincent Liu, Hyperithm co-CEO Oh Sangrok, and Synthetix founder Kain Warwick are among the tokenholders expected to attend the dinner at the Trump National Golf Club outside Washington, DC. The memecoin project said all applicants had to pass a background check and could not be from a “[Know Your Customer] watchlist country.”Related: Democrats seek suspicious activity reports linked to Trump crypto venturesPublic Citizen, in partnership with progressive political organization Our Revolution, will hold a rally near the golf club, which Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley is expected to attend. In addition, the Arlington and Loudoun Democrats will be hosting a separate event to urge US officials to “hold [Trump] accountable,” and Democratic leadership in Congress has scheduled two press events on May 22 ahead of the dinner.“Americans cannot and will not accept President Trump’s view that positions of power exist only to benefit the holder of that power,” Ryan Ruzic, chair of the Loudoun County Democratic Committee, told Cointelegraph. “We have a moral responsibility to speak out against corruption, whatever the result may be.”Pushback on TRUMP memecoin affected crypto legislationSome lawmakers initially cited the memecoin dinner and the Trump family’s involvement with the crypto platform World Liberty Financial in opposing passage of the GENIUS Act, a bill to regulate payment stablecoins. World Liberty Financial began issuing its own USD1 stablecoin in March, prompting concerns about Trump’s conflicts of interest. However, the legislation passed a key procedural vote in the Senate on May 19 with support from Democrats, setting the bill up for debate in the chamber.“Many senators, myself included, have very real concerns about the Trump family’s use of crypto technologies to evade oversight, hide shady financial dealings, and personally profit at the expense of everyday Americans,” said Sen. Mark Warner in a statement before the May 19 vote, adding: “But we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay.”Senator Chris Murphy, who voted against advancing the GENIUS Act, called for bipartisan support in amending the bill to specifically bar a US president from issuing stablecoins. He also called on the White House to release a complete list of attendees to the memecoin dinner, suggesting that some or all of them would “try to get something from the president” in exchange for purchasing the tokens. Murphy and Senator Elizabeth Warren will attend a press event with representatives for Public Citizen on May 22. California Representative Maxine Waters, ranking member of the US House Financial Services Committee, announced a separate press conference for the same day, with plans to introduce a bill to “block Trump’s memecoin and stop his crypto corruption, once and for all.”As of May 21, the exact number of attendees to the dinner was unknown. A smaller group of 25 tokenholders also qualified to apply for “VIP tour” and reception — presumably at the White House — with Trump, but the complete list of those planning to attend was also unknown at the time of publication.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/protest-donald-trump-memecoin-dinner?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

For many, this could be the long-awaited climax of the past four years, and major players are preparing accordingly.Since late 2024, Bitcoin whale accumulation has surged. Glassnode data shows that the number of addresses holding over 100 BTC has jumped by almost 14%, reaching 18,200 — a level not seen since 2017. The biggest market players appear to be positioning for what could be this cycle’s final run-up.Number of BTC addresses holding over 100 BTC. Source: GlassnodeHowever, riding the rally is trickier than it looks and knowing when to exit is notoriously difficult. The lure of higher price highs fuels FOMO, driving investors to buy the top, only to face painful drawdowns or even liquidations.So, how can traders and investors spot the top before the market enters recession?Bitcoin cycle top markersSeveral technical and onchain indicators, such as MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Z-score, Pi Cycle Top, and trading volume trends, have historically been reliable in signaling when Bitcoin is nearing its peak.The MVRV-Z score compares Bitcoin’s market value to its realized value and adjusts for volatility. A high Z-score suggests Bitcoin is significantly overvalued relative to its historical cost basis. When this indicator is at a historical high, the ensuing downward trend in Bitcoin prices is likely.The Pi Cycle Top tracks BTC price dynamics using moving averages. When the 111-day moving average (111-SMA) crosses above twice the 350-day average (350-SMAx2), it signals overheating. In other words, when the short-term trend catches up to the long-term trajectory, a market top is in.Historically, all previous Bitcoin bull runs started with a notable surge in MVRV Z-score, and ended with 111-SMA crossing the longer-term trend.BTC: Pi Cycle Top + MVRV Z-score. Source: Marie Poteriaieva, GlassnodeAdditionally, lower trading volumes during price increases can be a warning sign, often signaling weakening momentum and potential for a reversal. On-balance volume (OBV), which registers cumulative volume flow, is a valuable metric for tracking this process. When OBV diverges from the price action, it is often an early reversal signal. The second leg of the 2021 bull run was a great example. While BTC price was hitting higher highs of $68,000 (compared to the previous all-time high of $63,170), trading volumes moved in a different direction, decreasing from 710,000 BTC to 628,000 BTC. This created a bearish divergence between price and volume, suggesting that fewer market participants were supporting the rally — a classic sign of waning momentum.BTC/USD 1-day, OBV.

Some valuable metrics that can track it are the Puell Multiple and exchange flows.The Puell Multiple Indicator looks at miners' revenue relative to its 365-day average. High readings indicate miners may start selling aggressively, and are often seen near market tops.Large inflows to exchanges are usually signs of distribution, as investors prepare to sell their coins. BTC total transfer volume to exchanges + Puell Multiple.

The curved parabolic trendline that’s supported the rally is broken — a clear signal that the top is likely in. Meanwhile, altcoins and meme tokens may continue pumping a little longer.Complacency. Measure 15% below Bitcoin’s all-time high. That’s the sell zone. Order books on major exchanges often show a wall of sell orders around this level — a likely institutional exit point.According to Garner, the 15% (or 16%) rule works not only in crypto but in traditional markets as well.Historical blow off-tops: BTC, ETH, gold, Nasdaq, Nikkei, Broadvision, 3D Systems.

In a May 21 social media post that begins with, “The Empire Lobbies Back,” Campbell claimed that the banking industry is especially alarmed by the potential for stablecoins to offer interest or rewards to holders. In a pointed message aimed at Democratic lawmakers, Campbell wrote that “banks want you to protect their cartel so they can keep screwing your voters.” He went on to explain how fractional reserve banking enables banks to maximize profits while offering depositors minimal interest.The banking lobby says that if stablecoins pay interest or any other type of monetary reward, banks will be “harmed,” Campbell added.An excerpt of Campbell’s X post.

The model, which uses quantile regression to map Bitcoin’s price phases on a logarithmic scale, indicates the cryptocurrency is in the Transition Zone, a critical juncture before the Acceleration Phase. Throughout Q4, 2024, Bitcoin rallied by 45% after entering a price discovery period above $74,500. Bitcoin Quantile Model. Source: X.comAs illustrated in the chart, once it breaks into the \""Acceleration\"" Phase, it could trigger BTC’s next leg or the mid-phase, typically between the 33% and 66% range. Based on the model, BTC is expected to progressively target price levels of $130,000 and $163,000 in the coming months. However, anonymous Bitcoin analyst apsk32 believed a price target above $200,000 is a “reasonable” expectation for 2025. Basing the projection on Bitcoin’s “power curve,” the analyst noted that BTC’s position relative to gold has significantly improved since April. From a technical standpoint, this view is supported by the recent convergence of the Sharpe ratios for Bitcoin and gold, suggesting that the two hard assets now offer comparable risk-to-reward profiles to their investors. Fidelity’s Director of Global Macro Jurrien Timmer shed light on this development, recommending a 4:1 goal-to-Bitcoin ratio from an allocation perspective. Related: Bitcoin 'blow-off top' set at $128K with new all-time highs in sightStrong Bitcoin volumes “final straw” before new highs Crypto researcher Aylo analyzed BTC’s historical price action when the crypto asset consolidates near its all-time high level. In an X post, the analyst explained, “The data shows when BTC gets close to its previous ATH during a strong, accelerating trend with high momentum, it has historically broken out to new ATHs within a short time (days to weeks).”However, weaker trends have led to stalls or retraces between March and May 2024. Currently, Bitcoin exhibits a strong trend but lacks the necessary trading volume, which remains the final straw to confirm a breakout, a factor that could delay upward movement.Alyo added that for Bitcoin to break its all-time highs, daily trading volume should exceed the previous 10 days, be at least 1.5 times the 20-day average, and ideally sustain a 3-day increase while the price holds steady or rises.Data from CryptoQuant has reinforced Aylo’s concerns about trading volume. On May 21, retail investor demand for Bitcoin, defined as wallets buying/selling between $0 and $10,000, remained low at just 3.2% over 30 days, despite BTC trading within $2,000 of its all-time high.Bitcoin’s retail investor volumes.

Bitcoin (BTC) set a new high of $109,400 on May 21, rising more than 26% in the past month, according to data from TradingView.

2025-05-21T15:00:00.000Z,"How to handle crypto trading gains and losses on your balance sheet","Key takeawaysProperly accounting for crypto assets on your balance sheet is essential for accurate tax reporting and financial transparency.Crypto trading activities should be recorded like stock trading, at fair market value on the day of purchase.In some countries, like the US, crypto losses can offset gains, so keeping track of gains and losses is important for reducing taxable income.Whether you’re an individual investor or a business, treating cryptocurrencies as assets and documenting them ensures compliance with tax laws and minimizes the risk of errors.Let’s be real, it’s easy to lose sight of what you’ve actually gained or lost, especially when it comes to crypto and its market volatility and frequent trading activities. And when it comes to accounting, especially in countries like the United States, it gets trickier because you must reflect those numbers properly on your balance sheet. If you are running a business that involves crypto or you are just a crypto investor, understanding how to account for your digital assets correctly is crucial. This guide breaks down the basics of balance sheets, handling crypto gains and losses, and what tax implications you need to account for.What is a balance sheet, and why is it needed?Think of a balance sheet as a report of your financial health. It shows what you own, owe and what’s left over at a specific point in time. It contains three main parts: Assets: What the company owns, such as cash, crypto, real estate, inventory, etc.Liabilities: What the company owes, such as loans, unpaid bills and taxesEquity: What’s left after subtracting liabilities from assets (net worth).For example, if you own $50,000 worth of crypto, and at the same time, you owe someone $20,000. In this case, your equity is $30,000. Balance sheets help you understand your financial position at a glance. They’re essential for filing taxes, attracting investors, applying for loans and complying with regulations. Balance sheets are essential in countries like the United States, where businesses must report crypto holdings accurately for tax and compliance reasons. Similarly, in the UK, European countries and Canada, balance sheets are important for businesses and are often used by individuals, especially when dealing with crypto assets. It’s not just for taxes. A well-maintained balance sheet can help you get funding, plan your finances, or simply sleep better knowing where you stand at night.How do you treat crypto on a balance sheet?One of the most common questions when preparing a balance sheet is, “How to report crypto trading gains and losses on a balance sheet?” In most jurisdictions, the crypto reporting and taxation rules are still to be decided or clarified. This also applies to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which lack definitive guidance concerning cryptocurrency accounting.As cryptocurrencies are considered assets in many jurisdictions, the fundamental concepts of accounting for assets could apply when preparing a balance sheet involving crypto transactions. Below is an example of a simplified crypto balance sheet treatment and some helpful pointers that may assist you in accounting for crypto trading in 2025.Notes to the balance sheet:Cash ($15,000): Represents fiat currency (e.g., USD) held in bank accounts or wallets, including proceeds from selling crypto or other revenue.Cryptocurrency ($20,000): Recorded at cost basis (fair market value at acquisition, less any impairment). Includes 0.5 Bitcoin (BTC) purchased at $30,000 each ($15,000 total) and 10 Ether (ETH) purchased at $500 each ($5,000 total). No impairment has been recorded, assuming the fair market value (FMV) remains above cost.Mining equipment ($5,000): Capitalized cost of crypto mining hardware, net of depreciation. The original cost was $8,000, with $3,000 accumulated depreciation over two years.Accounts payable ($2,000): Unpaid bills (e.g., for electricity or supplier services related to crypto mining operations).Taxes payable ($1,500): Estimated tax liability for realized crypto gains (e.g., from selling 0.1 BTC at a $2,000 gain, taxed at 20% long-term capital gains rate for simplicity).Retained earnings ($36,500): Accumulated profits, including crypto-related income (e.g., mining revenue, realized gains) minus expenses and taxes. Reflects net income from prior and current periods.When buying cryptocurrency with fiat moneyWhen you buy cryptocurrency with fiat money, such as dollars or euros, you’re simply exchanging one type of asset, such as cash, for another, like crypto or stocks. On your balance sheet, cryptocurrency trading activities should be recorded similarly to those of stock trading activities. As with stocks, you should record cryptocurrency on your balance sheet at its fair market value on the day of purchase. While your cash account displays a credit for the same amount, the cryptocurrency is recorded as a debit to your assets account.When selling cryptocurrency for fiat moneySelling crypto for fiat creates a change in your balance sheet: Your crypto holdings will be reduced, meaning credited, and your cash will increase, which also means that the account will be credited.If you sell for more than you paid (the original price of a token), you have a gain; if you sell for less, you record a loss. Both crypto gains and crypto losses should be tracked carefully for tax and reporting purposes.How to record crypto lossesThe difference is recorded as a loss when you sell crypto at a lower price than you bought it for. In some countries, these losses can lower your taxable income, so it can prove useful to properly document them.  However, even if the asset regains its previous price levels, impairment losses cannot be undone in accordance with GAAP’s accounting rules for intangible assets.This contrasts with IFRS, where certain intangible assets can be revalued upward under IAS 38 if an active market exists. However, crypto markets are volatile, and IFRS guidance on crypto revaluation remains unclear, so most entities stick to cost-less impairment. Businesses should consult local accounting standards and auditors for precise treatment.How to record crypto profitsIf you receive cryptocurrency as payment for goods, services or other activities, it’s treated as income at the fair market value on the date you receive it. This value is recorded as revenue and added to your assets. Later, if you sell or swap the crypto, any difference in value will result in a capital gain or loss.How to record crypto mining When cryptocurrency mining income occurs, it should be reported at the currency’s fair market value. This revenue should be shown on your income statement since it increases your assets.Similar to other revenue-generating activities, companies engaged in cryptocurrency mining are required to report their crypto profits on their balance sheet. Their mining income account will be credited as a result. Subsequently, the newly generated digital asset has to be recorded in their accounts at its fair market value.Additionally, costs related to mining operations should be recorded. For example, the cash account needs to be credited if cash is spent to cover mining costs. The purchase of mining equipment, which requires capitalization and amortization, will subsequently be deducted from the associated asset account or otherwise documented as a cost for items like utilities and supplies.Using cryptocurrency to pay suppliersPaying suppliers or vendors with cryptocurrency is like selling the asset since you have to recognize any gain or loss in relation to its original value. Therefore, the difference between the asset’s book value and its expense will be recorded as a capital gain.How to record transaction fees and exchange rates It’s critical to keep track of transaction costs and exchange rate fluctuations when trading or exchanging cryptocurrencies. Fees should be shown as an expense on the balance sheet since they lower your net gain or increase your loss. Changes in exchange rates may also have an impact on the value recorded when converting cryptocurrency into fiat, which could have an effect on your taxes and capital gains.Did you know? Cryptocurrency held for more than a year can be categorized as a long-term asset on your balance sheet in some jurisdictions, which may result in better tax treatment than short-term holdings.How are cryptocurrencies taxed?Taxation of cryptocurrencies varies by country, but your balance sheet plays a crucial role in tracking taxable events. Under current GAAP, crypto is recorded at cost and tested for impairment. IFRS allows revaluation in rare cases, but most entities use the cost model. For traders holding crypto as inventory, GAAP (ASC 330) or IFRS (IAS 2) may apply, with FMV adjustments. The lack of definitive guidance means businesses must apply judgment and document assumptions clearly. In the US, crypto is treated as property, with taxes applied to capital gains when selling or trading. The Internal Revenue Service requires reporting on your balance sheet; losses can offset gains. Also, the US introduced Form 1099-DA in 2025 for crypto brokers to report transactions, increasing compliance requirements. In the UK, cryptocurrencies are taxed under capital gains for individuals, while income tax may apply if trading is frequent or when crypto is received as income, such as through mining, staking or as payment for services.Canada follows a similar approach, taxing crypto as capital gains (50% inclusion rate) or business income for active traders. Mining income is taxable as income.In Germany, long-term holders (over a year) pay no tax on capital gains, but short-term trades over 600 euros are taxed. Notably, the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation (effective 2024) standardizes crypto reporting, impacting balance sheet documentation in member states.Accounting for Ethereum transactionsEthereum, the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts, has unique accounting needs. Here’s how to handle common Ethereum transactions on your balance sheet:Staking rewards: Staking ETH on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network generates rewards, treated as income at FMV when received. For example, receiving 0.1 ETH as a staking reward debits your “Cryptocurrency” asset account and credits “Revenue” on your income statement. Selling staked ETH later triggers a capital gain or loss.Gas fees: Ethereum transactions incur gas fees, which are expenses. Record these as a debit to “Transaction Fees” (an expense account) and a credit to “Cash” or “Cryptocurrency” if paid in ETH. For example, a $50 gas fee paid in ETH reduces your ETH holdings and is expensed.DeFi transactions: Yield farming or liquidity provision (e.g., on Uniswap) generates rewards, treated as income at FMV when received. For example, earning 100 UNI (UNI) tokens ($1,000) debits “Cryptocurrency” and credits “Revenue.” Track gas fees and token swaps as expenses or taxable events.ERC-20 tokens: Ethereum-based tokens (e.g., USDC, LINK) are separate assets. Record each at its FMV at acquisition, like ETH, and track them individually to avoid confusion.Accurate tracking of Ethereum transactions ensures compliance, especially with increased IRS scrutiny on staking and DeFi in 2025.Tools and best practices for crypto accountingManaging crypto transactions can be daunting, but these tools and tips simplify the process:Accounting software: Use platforms like CoinTracker, Koinly or CryptoTaxCalculator to track Ethereum transactions, calculate gains/losses, and generate tax reports. These tools integrate with wallets and exchanges, ensuring accurate FMV records.Regular reconciliation: Match your balance sheet’s crypto holdings to wallet/exchange records monthly to catch errors, especially for gas fees or staking rewards.Work with professionals: Crypto tax rules, especially for Ethereum’s DeFi and staking, are complex. Consult a crypto-savvy accountant to ensure compliance with IRS, His Majesty’s Revenue & Customs or other regulations.Document everything: Keep records of every Ethereum transaction, including FMV, gas fees and staking rewards, to prepare for audits or Form 1099-DA reporting in 2025.By staying organized, you’ll minimize errors and stress when filing taxes or preparing financial statements.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-trading-gains-and-losses-on-balance-sheet?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-21T15:00:00.000Z,"Crypto&#039;s real momentum isn&#039;t in the charts; it&#039;s in developer activity","Opinion by: Markus Levin, co-founder of XYOThe crypto community often experiences periods of heightened anxiety. Market downturns are often triggered by counterproductive sentiment-driven events rather than by fundamental issues, creating a significant disconnect between price behavior and the actual progress being made within the industry by the companies within it. What often goes unnoticed is how much real development happens during these downturns. While market movements capture most of the attention, teams are building faster and more deliberately behind the scenes than ever. The focus shifts away from price speculation and toward real execution. Growth happens during downturns. It's a necessary phase for projects that thrive in a volatile industry. They re-focus attention on refining their technology and business, fueling the next wave of progress.As a result, there's a disconnect between online sentiment and conversations between blockchain industry leaders. For builders and project leaders, the atmosphere is of determination, not doom.Regulators are coming on boardOne of the most promising developments is the accelerating momentum of regulation policy. Many European companies are applying for MiCA licenses in preparation for regulatory updates. There's also a significant policy shift under new US leadership as the SEC retreats from several high-profile crypto enforcement actions. The disparity between sentiment and reality serves as a reminder that price is a lagging indicator. Selloffs are triggered by uncertainty around tariff announcements and background activity such as interest rates. Material, long-term statistics speak for the virtually universal optimism among industry leaders as the number of active developers has remained stable, and the number of established developers almost doubled last year. That's an incredible jump in only one year. From hype to substanceMaturation means teams thoughtfully building, governments engaging seriously with legislation, and users demanding better UX and real utility. The industry has a well-established pattern — market corrections wipe away hype and encourage focus. The last bear market gave rise to breakthroughs in DeFi, NFTs, and zero-knowledge tech. This time, it's about real-world infrastructure, regulation-ready platforms, and next-gen scalability.What emerges in these periods tends to be less visible but more durable. Teams that remain active are often those with clear models, sufficient runway, and a willingness to adapt. These are the periods when we learn whether the systems being built can handle real-world demands. One of the most promising frontiers lies at the intersection of AI and blockchain, the most ubiquitous being within Large Language Models. AI is, however, only as good as the data it's trained on.AI systems are evolving rapidly, but their foundations are skewed. They're built primarily on data scraped from the digital-first countries that predominantly lie in the northern hemisphere, which dominates global media production and internet usage. This creates a feedback loop where Western and East Asian perspectives and widely spoken languages such as English and Mandarin are not only amplified but leave little room for necessary data from smaller populations.A report from Web3 Technologies said 60% of tier-one media on the internet is English. Prominent among these media outlets is The New York Times, which has sued OpenAI based on copyright infringement. The publication alleges that their copyright-protected data was used to train OpenAI's LLM model. Recent: The future of finance is built on Bitcoin — Ethereum was just the testnetKnowing the full extent of the global imbalance in the data creating AI outputs is impossible. Allegations like this and the results delivered when using AI tools suggest the pressing need for a solution.It's even worse. When AI systems are trained on narrow, incomplete data sets, the results can exclude billions from the benefits of emerging technologies. As IBM highlights, data bias isn't just a technical issue — it's a human one with real-world consequences in healthcare, finance, agriculture, and beyond.It's become normal to use AI data every day. We receive personalized Google search results, Adobe has built AI into its industry-standard graphic and video software, and we use AI assistants like Gemini, Grok, and ChatGPT to formulate the thoughts with which we represent ourselves. All of these tools are affected by an overwhelming bias toward the center of a bell curve within their data sets, unable to access or address less common use cases.A popular example demonstrates this issue: Until recently, image generators could not create a full wine glass. No matter what prompt you provided, a wine glass full to the edge was beyond the capabilities of all known generative AI software because they had never been provided photos of wine glasses full to the brim. Their data sets had to be updated to correct this comical problem, which revealed a much more serious one.Decentralized data offers a solution. Globally incentivized systems like DePINs enable the participation of populations that would otherwise remain underserved, allowing the valuable data they provide to come online. This improves the service for everyone, making smaller global communities more accessible to commerce and enabling them easier access to the rest of the world. It also empowers smaller data creators to monetize their data rather than relinquishing it to tech giants. Where do we go from here?The crypto industry is entering a new phase. A phase that's more productive and sustainable. Expect to see rapid growth in working infrastructure, platforms and applications that welcome knowledgeable, consumer-friendly regulations and projects that respect the time and money of their users.Opportunities within the crypto space are changing but not shrinking. Our opportunities grow as we learn from what has not worked in the last few years. They will take time to develop, but successful builders will focus on long-term, incremental change and sound business practices rather than chasing fads and short-term profits.The momentum of real progress has never been stronger, and it is precisely during times like these, when it feels like no one's watching, that the foundations of the future are laid.Opinion by: Markus Levin, co-founder of XYO.

2025-05-21T14:00:55.000Z,"AI tool claims 97% efficacy in preventing ‘address poisoning’ attacks","Crypto cybersecurity firm Trugard and onchain trust protocol Webacy have developed an artificial intelligence-based system for detecting crypto wallet address poisoning.According to a May 21 announcement shared with Cointelegraph, the new tool is part of Webacy’s crypto decisioning tools and “leverages a supervised machine learning model trained on live transaction data in conjunction with onchain analytics, feature engineering and behavioral context.” The new tool purportedly has a success score of 97%, tested across known attack cases. “Address poisoning is one of the most underreported yet costly scams in crypto, and it preys on the simplest assumption: That what you see is what you get,” said Webacy co-founder Maika Isogawa.Address poisoning detection infographic. Source: Trugard and WebacyCrypto address poisoning is a scam where attackers send small amounts of cryptocurrency from a wallet address that closely resembles a target’s real address, often with the same starting and ending characters. The goal is to trick the user into accidentally copying and reusing the attacker’s address in future transactions, resulting in lost funds.The technique exploits how users often rely on partial address matching or clipboard history when sending crypto. A January 2025 study found that over 270 million poisoning attempts occurred on BNB Chain and Ethereum between July 1, 2022, and June 30, 2024. Of those, 6,000 attempts were successful, leading to losses over $83 million.Related: What are address poisoning attacks in crypto and how to avoid them?Web2 security in a Web3 worldTrugard chief technology officer Jeremiah O’Connor told Cointelegraph that the team brings deep cybersecurity expertise from the Web2 world, which they’ve been “applying to Web3 data since the early days of crypto.” The team is applying its experience with algorithmic feature engineering from traditional systems to Web3. He added:“Most existing Web3 attack detection systems rely on static rules or basic transaction filtering. These methods often fall behind evolving attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures.“The newly developed system instead leverages machine learning to create a system that learns and adapts to address poisoning attacks. O’Connor highlighted that what sets their system apart is “its emphasis on context and pattern recognition.” Isogawa explained that “AI can detect patterns often beyond the reach of human analysis.”Related: Jameson Lopp sounds alarm on Bitcoin address poisoning attacksThe machine learning approachO’Connor said Trugard generated synthetic training data for the AI to simulate various attack patterns. Then the model was trained through supervised learning, a type of machine learning where a model is trained on labeled data, including input variables and the correct output.In such a setup, the goal is for the model to learn the relationship between inputs and outputs to predict the correct output for new, unseen inputs. Common examples include spam detection, image classification and price prediction.O’Connor said the model is also updated by training it on new data as new strategies emerge. “To top it off, we’ve built a synthetic data generation layer that lets us continuously test the model against simulated poisoning scenarios,” he said. “This has proven incredibly effective in helping the model generalize and stay robust over time.“Magazine: Crypto-Sec: Phishing scammer goes after Hedera users, address poisoner gets $70K",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-system-has-97-claimed-efficacy-in-preventing-address-poisoning-attacks?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

After failing to gain support from key Democrats on May 8, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act passed the US Senate in a 66–32 procedural vote on May 20 and is now heading to a debate on the Senate floor.The bill seeks to set clear rules for stablecoin collateralization and mandate compliance with Anti-Money Laundering laws.Related: German gov’t missed out on $2.3B profit after selling Bitcoin at $57K“This act doesn’t just regulate stablecoins, it legitimizes them,” said Andrei Grachev, managing partner at DWF Labs and Falcon Finance.“It sets clear rules, and with clarity comes confidence.

Monthly remittances typically range from $131 to $648, representing between 6% and 23% of the sender’s average income.“Remittances are lifelines in this region, but they’re broken,” Lapchik told Cointelegraph. “Guatemala alone sees $21 billion in remittances every year, and families are losing 6% to 10% of that to fees and delays. These are people sending $300, $400 a month, and they can’t afford to wait days or pay that much just to get money home,” he said, adding:“Crypto solves this when it’s used the right way. It lets us move money instantly and at a fraction of the cost, integrated into the bank apps people already use.” Latin America is the second-fastest growing region in terms of crypto adoption, though Guatemala lags behind regional leaders Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia, according to a 2024 Chainalysis study.The study cited stablecoins as a primary adoption driver in the region. Crypto adoption in Latin America by total value received.

Pendle now accounts for 30% of all yield-bearing stablecoin total value locked (TVL), roughly $3 billion, the firm said in a report shared with Cointelegraph.  Pendle noted that stablecoins make up 83% of its $4 billion total value locked, a sharp rise from less than 20% just a year ago. In contrast, assets such as Ether (ETH), which historically contributed 80–90% of Pendle’s TVL, have shrunk to less than 10% of its TVL.Traditional stablecoins like USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC) do not pass on interest to holders.

The platform will be powered by Maia, an AI core engine developed by My Aion, and aims to optimize and manage systems across mobility, energy, education, healthcare and digital services. My Aion CEO Daniele Marinelli said the AI will know the user well enough to “recommend the perfect place for your anniversary dinner and book it for you without you lifting a finger.”The project will debut in Abu Dhabi before expanding internationally. It is expected to launch in 18 months. Multibillion-dollar AI project to create jobs for UAE nationalsThe project is structured under a $2.5 billion Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) model, a public-private partnership model for large-scale infrastructure and technology projects. Under the model, private sector entities construct the infrastructure, run and manage the system for a certain period. The companies usually recoup their investments and earn profits during the operational phase. At the end of the period set by the parties involved, ownership and control of the systems developed through the BOT model are transferred to the government or a public sector entity. Bold Technologies CEO Thani Al Thani Al Falasi said the initiative will support UAE job creation. “This initiative will support job creation for UAE nationals, foster local innovation and contribute meaningfully to the national AI ecosystem,” he said. My Aion’s Marinelli said that relocating to Abu Dhabi provides their global operations with a new chapter. “The UAE offers the infrastructure and institutional support needed to scale responsibly and strategically,” Marinelli said.Cointelegraph has reached out to Bold Technologies and My Aion for more information. Related: Decentralized OORT AI data hits top ranks on Google KaggleCrypto proponents say AI could benefit from digital assetsOn May 20, Catena Labs, a project led by Circle co-founder Sean Neville, announced that it will create an AI-native financial institution.

2025-05-21T08:38:10.000Z,"SEC’s Peirce says NFT royalties do not make tokens securities","United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Hester Peirce said many non-fungible tokens (NFTs), including those with mechanisms to pay creator royalties, likely fall outside the purview of federal securities laws.In a recent speech, Peirce said NFTs that allow artists to earn resale revenue do not automatically qualify as securities. Unlike stocks, NFTs are programmable assets that distribute proceeds to developers or artists. The SEC official said that mirrors how streaming platforms compensate musicians and filmmakers. “Just as streaming platforms pay royalties to the creator of a song or video each time a user plays it, an NFT can enable artists to benefit from the appreciation in the value of their work after its initial sale,” Peirce said. Peirce added that the feature does not provide NFT owners any rights or interest in any business enterprise or profits “traditionally associated with securities.”SEC never prohibited NFT royaltiesOscar Franklin Tan, chief legal officer of Enjin core contributor Atlas Development Services, told Cointelegraph that the recent remarks by Peirce on NFTs and creator royalties have been widely misunderstood. Peirce had clarified that NFTs that send resale royalties to artists are not necessarily securities, a view Tan says is legally sound but mischaracterized in some media reports. “So Hester Peirce said that an NFT that sends royalties back to the creator after a sale is not a security. This is correct, but the way some media reported this is completely out of context,” Tan told Cointelegraph. “The actual context is that this is not controversial, and it was never considered a security.”The lawyer said US securities law focuses on regulating investments and not compensating creators for their work. “The artist or creator is not an investor, not a passive third party in the NFT,” he said, noting that royalty payments are not considered investment income. Instead, Tan told Cointelegraph that this type of earning is “analogous to business income,” which the SEC does not regulate. He added: “The SEC never prohibited contracts where artists and creators get royalties from secondary sales of their work, not royalties from paper contracts or blockchain protocols.”Tan explained that the legal distinction becomes more complicated when NFTs promise shared profits from royalties to multiple holders beyond the original creator. Tan also urged regulators and market participants to apply traditional legal reasoning to new blockchain technologies. “Ask yourself, if this were done by pen and paper instead of blockchain, would there still be a regulatory issue?” he said. “If none, slow down.”Source: Oscar Franklin TanRelated: SEC charges Unicoin crypto platform over alleged $100 million fraudOpenSea calls on the SEC to exempt NFT marketplaces from oversightWhile NFT royalties may not have been a controversial SEC issue, NFT marketplaces are a different case. In August 2024, NFT trading platform OpenSea received a Wells notice from the SEC, alleging that NFTs traded on the marketplace could qualify as unregistered securities. On Feb. 22, OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer announced that the SEC has officially closed its investigation into the platform. The executive said that this was a win for the industry. Following the conclusion of the SEC’s investigation, OpenSea’s lawyers penned a letter to Peirce, who leads the SEC’s Crypto Task Force. OpenSea general counsel Adele Faure and deputy general counsel Laura Brookover said in an April 9 letter that NFT marketplaces don’t qualify as brokers under US securities laws. The lawyers said the marketplaces don’t execute transactions or act as intermediaries. The lawyers urged the SEC to “clearly state that NFT marketplaces like OpenSea do not qualify as exchanges under federal securities laws.”Magazine: NBA star Tristan Thompson misses $32B in Bitcoin by taking $82M contract in cash",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/nft-royalties-not-securities-sec-peirce?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-21T08:27:53.000Z,"South Korea tightens crypto rules ahead of institutional market entry","South Korea is tightening rules around digital asset transactions as it prepares to allow institutional players into its crypto market, introducing new guidelines for nonprofit crypto sales and stricter listing standards for exchanges.On May 20, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) of South Korea said during its fourth Virtual Asset Committee meeting that it had finalized sweeping new measures.Set to take effect in June, the updated rules allow both nonprofit organizations and virtual asset exchanges to sell cryptocurrencies, but under new compliance standards.Nonprofit entities must have at least five years of audited financial history to be permitted to receive and sell virtual asset donations. They will also need to establish internal Donation Review Committees to assess the appropriateness of each donation and the liquidation strategy.To reduce risks of money laundering, all donations must be routed through verified Korean won exchange accounts, with verification responsibilities placed on banks, exchanges and the nonprofits themselves.Furthermore, only cryptocurrencies listed on at least three major domestic exchanges will be eligible, and liquidation is expected to occur immediately upon receipt.Guidelines regarding nonprofits selling crypto donations.

Sales will be capped at daily limits, typically no more than 10% of the total planned amount.Furthermore, sales will only be permitted for the top 20 tokens by market cap across five won-based exchanges. Importantly, exchanges are barred from selling tokens on their own platforms to prevent conflicts of interest.South Korea is also tightening standards for listing digital assets. The revised rules aim to curb instability from sudden price spikes by requiring a minimum circulating supply before a token is allowed to trade and temporarily restricting market orders post-listing.So-called zombie tokens (with low volume and thin market caps) and memecoins without clear utility will face more scrutiny. For instance, exchanges must delist tokens if they fail to meet liquidity benchmarks or community engagement thresholds.Starting in June, exchanges and nonprofits can apply for real-name accounts to facilitate these sales. Later this year, the FSC plans to extend real-name accounts to listed firms and professional investors.Cointelegraph contacted South Korea’s Digital Asset eXchange Association for comment, but had not received a response by publication.Related: RedotPay enters South Korea with crypto-powered payment cardsSouth Korean candidates push pro-crypto agendaSouth Korea’s Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung has proposed launching a stablecoin pegged to the Korean won, aiming to curb capital flight and bolster the country’s financial autonomy.Speaking at a recent policy forum, Lee said a won-based stablecoin could help retain domestic wealth and reduce dependence on foreign-backed digital currencies such as USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC).The initiative is part of Lee’s broader push for digital asset reforms, which also includes legalizing spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs).His rival, Kim Moon-soo of the ruling People Power Party, has also expressed support for introducing spot crypto ETFs, signaling bipartisan momentum on the issue.Magazine: NBA star Tristan Thompson misses $32B in Bitcoin by taking $82M contract in cash",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/south-korea-tightens-kyc-rules-ahead-of-institutional-crypto-entry?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
