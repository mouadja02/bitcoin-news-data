2025-05-23T01:50:39.000Z,"Crucial Protection: US Supreme Court Safeguards Federal Reserve Independence and Jerome Powell","BitcoinWorld Crucial Protection: US Supreme Court Safeguards Federal Reserve Independence and Jerome Powell The stability of the global financial system and the health of the U.S. economy often rest significantly on the actions and independence of one crucial institution: the Federal Reserve . As the central bank of the United States, its decisions on interest rates and the money supply ripple through markets worldwide, influencing everything from borrowing costs for businesses and families to the valuation of assets, including the dynamic cryptocurrency space. Recent news, highlighted by a Bloomberg report, brings into focus a significant legal development reinforcing the Fed’s unique position, specifically addressing concerns about potential political pressure on its leadership, like Chairman Jerome Powell . Understanding the Federal Reserve and Its Unique Structure Before diving into the recent legal news, it’s helpful to understand what the Federal Reserve is and why its structure is considered ‘quasi-private’ and unique. Established in 1913, the Fed was designed to provide a more stable and secure financial system for the nation. It’s not a typical government agency in the same way as, say, the Department of Commerce. Here’s a quick breakdown: Structure: It’s composed of a Board of Governors appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks (which are technically owned by member commercial banks), and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which sets monetary policy. Funding: The Fed is self-financing, earning income primarily from interest on government securities it holds. It does not rely on congressional appropriations, which is a key element of its independence. Mandate: Congress sets the goals for monetary policy, which are maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The Fed has the independence to choose how to pursue these goals. This blend of public purpose and private-like structure contributes to the concept of Fed independence . Why is Fed Independence Crucial for Economic Stability? The concept of Fed independence is not just an academic one; it’s widely seen by economists and policymakers as essential for effective monetary policy and overall economic stability. The primary argument for independence is to insulate monetary policy decisions from short-term political pressures. Imagine a scenario where interest rates were set directly by elected politicians. During economic downturns, there might be immense pressure to lower rates excessively or print money to stimulate the economy rapidly, even if such actions risked runaway inflation down the line. Conversely, during booms, there might be reluctance to raise rates to cool the economy for fear of slowing job growth before an election. An independent central bank, like the Federal Reserve , can make difficult but necessary decisions – like raising interest rates to combat inflation even if it causes short-term pain – based on economic data and long-term goals, rather than the political cycle. This ability to prioritize long-term price stability and sustainable employment is considered a major benefit. Historical examples from various countries suggest that central banks with greater independence tend to have better track records in controlling inflation. The US Supreme Court Weighs In: Protecting Leadership Like Jerome Powell The Bloomberg report specifically highlighted a US Supreme Court ruling that appears to significantly bolster the legal protections surrounding the leadership of independent federal agencies, and by extension, the Federal Reserve . While the ruling itself might have stemmed from a different agency or context, the interpretation, as reported by Bloomberg, is that its principles apply to the Fed due to its independent structure. The core of the matter often revolves around the President’s power to remove the heads of these agencies. Unlike cabinet secretaries who serve at the pleasure of the President, the heads of independent agencies typically have some form of protection, often requiring ‘for cause’ removal rather than arbitrary dismissal. The Supreme Court’s stance in the relevant ruling reportedly affirmed or clarified the strength of these protections. This is particularly relevant in the context of past tensions between former President Donald Trump and current Fed Chair Jerome Powell . During his presidency, Trump frequently and publicly criticized Powell and the Fed’s monetary policy decisions, particularly interest rate hikes. This led to speculation and concern among some observers about whether a president could attempt to remove a Fed Chair they disagreed with. The Supreme Court ruling, as interpreted by Bloomberg, seems to have largely settled these concerns by reinforcing the legal barriers to such a dismissal, confirming that the Fed Chair, like heads of other independent agencies with similar structures, cannot be easily fired without proper legal justification. How Does This Protection Influence Monetary Policy and Markets (Including Crypto)? So, what does a Supreme Court ruling on agency head removal have to do with monetary policy and, say, the price of Bitcoin? Quite a bit, actually. Monetary policy decisions – setting interest rates, managing the Fed’s balance sheet – are the primary tools the Fed uses to influence the economy. These decisions directly impact liquidity in the financial system, the cost of borrowing for individuals and businesses, and the attractiveness of different asset classes. A Fed Chair who feels secure in their position, protected from political reprisal for unpopular but necessary decisions, is more likely to pursue consistent, data-driven monetary policy aimed at achieving the Fed’s long-term mandates. Conversely, a Chair who feared arbitrary dismissal might be tempted to make policy decisions that are politically expedient in the short term, even if detrimental to the economy in the long run. For financial markets, including the relatively new and often volatile cryptocurrency market, stability and predictability from the central bank are generally viewed positively. While crypto markets react to a unique set of factors, they are not immune to macroeconomic forces. Decisions on interest rates, for instance, influence the broader risk-on/risk-off sentiment in markets. When rates are low and liquidity is high (often during periods of accommodative monetary policy), investors may be more inclined to invest in riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. When rates rise (during tightening monetary policy), safer assets like bonds become more attractive, potentially reducing appetite for crypto. The Supreme Court ruling, by reinforcing the independence and security of the Fed Chair’s position, contributes to the perception of stable and predictable monetary policy making. This clarity reduces a potential source of uncertainty that could otherwise add volatility to markets. Challenges and Considerations Regarding Independence While Fed independence is widely supported, it’s not without its critics or challenges. One key area of debate is accountability. If the Fed is independent of direct political control, to whom is it accountable? The Fed does report to Congress and its leadership testifies regularly, but decisions are made internally. Another challenge is ensuring transparency in decision-making processes. While the Fed has made strides in communicating its policy intentions and rationale, the inner workings can still seem opaque to the public. Balancing independence with appropriate oversight and transparency remains an ongoing discussion. Actionable Insights from the Bloomberg Report What can we take away from this Bloomberg report and the Supreme Court ruling it highlights? Reinforced Stability: The legal framework protecting the Federal Reserve ‘s leadership appears stronger, reducing the likelihood of politically motivated removals of the Fed Chair. Predictable Policy? Greater security for the Fed Chair supports the institution’s ability to pursue its mandated goals through consistent monetary policy , free from immediate political pressure. Reduced Uncertainty: For markets, including crypto, this removes a potential tail risk related to the political interference in central banking. Focus Remains on Economics: The primary drivers of Fed decisions will continue to be economic data related to inflation and employment, rather than shifts in political winds regarding the Chair’s position. Compelling Summary In conclusion, the Bloomberg report on the US Supreme Court ruling underscores a vital aspect of the American financial system: the protected independence of the Federal Reserve . By reinforcing the legal safeguards around the Fed Chair’s position, the ruling, as interpreted by Bloomberg, significantly reduces the potential for a president to dismiss the head of the central bank, as was a subject of past speculation concerning Jerome Powell and former President Trump. This legal certainty is crucial because it allows the Fed to pursue stable and effective monetary policy based on economic fundamentals, rather than short-term political considerations. For the economy and financial markets, including the cryptocurrency world, this reinforced Fed independence provides a greater degree of predictability and stability in the crucial realm of central banking decisions.

2025-05-23T01:40:41.000Z,"Crucial SEC Crypto ETF Decisions: Delays Hit XRP, Litecoin, Bitcoin; Staked TRX ETF Acknowledged","BitcoinWorld Crucial SEC Crypto ETF Decisions: Delays Hit XRP, Litecoin, Bitcoin; Staked TRX ETF Acknowledged The world of cryptocurrency investment products is constantly evolving, with significant attention focused on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Investors and enthusiasts eagerly await regulatory clarity, particularly concerning the approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that offer easier access to digital assets. Recently, the SEC made several announcements regarding pending applications, leading to a mix of anticipated delays and noteworthy acknowledgments in the SEC crypto ETF landscape. Understanding the Latest Crypto ETF Delays According to insights shared by Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, the SEC has formally pushed back its decision deadlines for a number of proposed crypto-related ETFs. While delays are not uncommon in the regulatory process, especially for novel or complex financial products like those tied to cryptocurrencies, these specific postponements highlight the ongoing cautious approach by the commission. The delayed filings include: Bitwise and CoinShares’ XRP ETFs: Two separate proposals seeking to offer exposure to the XRP cryptocurrency. A Litecoin ETF: A filing focused on the Litecoin cryptocurrency. Fidelity’s In-Kind Bitcoin ETF: This specific filing is for a Bitcoin ETF that would allow for ‘in-kind’ creations and redemptions, a structure different from the cash-only creation/redemption mechanism of the spot Bitcoin ETFs already approved. These delays mean the SEC requires more time to review the applications, potentially soliciting further public comments or conducting deeper analysis into market structure, custody solutions, and potential for manipulation concerning these specific assets and fund structures. While frustrating for applicants and investors hoping for quicker access, it’s part of the standard regulatory procedure for complex filings. Why Are Crypto ETF Delays Significant? Every delay from the SEC regarding a crypto ETF filing is closely watched by the market for several reasons: Market Sentiment: Delays can sometimes dampen market enthusiasm for the underlying asset, signaling continued regulatory hurdles. Path to Approval: While not necessarily a rejection, repeated delays can indicate the SEC has significant questions or concerns that need addressing. Institutional Interest: ETFs are popular investment vehicles for institutional investors and retail traders alike. Delays push back the timeline for broader market access and potential capital inflows. Regulatory Precedent: The SEC’s decisions on these filings, particularly for assets like XRP and structures like in-kind Bitcoin ETFs, could set precedents for future crypto investment products. The market has seen this pattern before. The journey to the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 was marked by numerous delays over several years, illustrating that patience is often required when navigating the U.S. regulatory landscape for crypto products. Spotlight on the XRP ETF Delays The postponement of decisions on the Bitwise and CoinShares XRP ETF proposals is particularly noteworthy. XRP’s regulatory status in the U.S. has been complex due to the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple Labs. While Ripple has achieved some favorable rulings regarding programmatic sales of XRP not being investment contracts, the overall legal picture is still evolving. The market has been anticipating potential XRP ETF filings, hoping that the partial legal clarity might pave the way for such products. However, the SEC’s decision to delay suggests they are taking a cautious approach, likely waiting for more definitive outcomes in the ongoing legal proceedings or requiring more time to assess the unique market dynamics and regulatory considerations surrounding XRP. The potential approval of an XRP ETF is seen by many as a significant catalyst for the asset, potentially bringing increased liquidity and mainstream investor access. The delays, while expected by some given the circumstances, push this potential catalyst further into the future. What About the Bitcoin ETF Delay? Fidelity’s in-kind Bitcoin ETF filing is also among those delayed. This is distinct from the cash-create/redeem spot Bitcoin ETFs that began trading earlier this year. In an in-kind structure, authorized participants (APs) would exchange actual Bitcoin for ETF shares (creation) and exchange ETF shares for actual Bitcoin (redemption). The SEC has historically preferred cash-only mechanisms for crypto ETFs, citing concerns about the custody and valuation of the underlying assets during the creation/redemption process in an in-kind model. The delay on Fidelity’s filing indicates the SEC is still scrutinizing the feasibility and regulatory compliance of this alternative structure, even after approving cash-based spot Bitcoin ETFs. While the market already has access to spot Bitcoin ETFs, the approval of an in-kind version could potentially offer minor operational or tax advantages depending on the fund structure and jurisdiction. The delay means this specific option remains on hold for now. A Glimmer of Hope: The Staked TRX ETF Acknowledgment Amidst the news of delays, there was a positive development: the SEC formally acknowledged Canary Funds’ proposal for a staked TRX ETF. An acknowledgment is the first step in the regulatory process, indicating the SEC has received the formal filing and the clock has started on their review period. It does not imply approval but is a necessary step towards it. The significance here lies in the ‘staked’ component. Traditional ETFs typically hold the underlying asset passively. A staked ETF, however, would aim to generate yield by participating in the staking mechanism of the underlying proof-of-stake cryptocurrency, in this case, TRON (TRX). What is Staking? Staking is a process available with many proof-of-stake blockchains where holders of the cryptocurrency can lock up their coins to support the network’s operations (like validating transactions) and in return, earn rewards, similar to earning interest. A staked TRX ETF would potentially offer investors exposure to the price movements of TRX while also passing on staking rewards, providing a potentially higher yield compared to a non-staked ETF. This could be an attractive feature for investors seeking passive income from their crypto holdings within a familiar ETF wrapper. Challenges for Staked ETFs: While innovative, staked ETFs present unique challenges for regulators: Slashing Risk: Staking involves risks, including ‘slashing,’ where a portion of staked assets can be penalized and lost if the validator node acts maliciously or goes offline. How would an ETF manage and disclose this risk? Yield Variability: Staking rewards can fluctuate based on network conditions, participation rates, and inflation models. This adds complexity compared to a simple price-tracking ETF. Custody and Control: Staking involves locking up assets and delegating them to validators. The custody and control mechanisms within an ETF structure would need careful consideration to ensure investor protection. Regulatory Classification: How does the income generated from staking fit into existing securities regulations? Is it yield, or something else? Despite these challenges, the acknowledgment of a staked TRX ETF proposal is a forward step, signaling that the SEC is beginning to engage with more complex, yield-generating crypto product structures beyond simple spot price tracking. The Broader SEC Crypto ETF Landscape These recent actions by the SEC underscore the dynamic and evolving nature of the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies in the United States. While the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs was a landmark moment, the path for other single-asset ETFs (like XRP or Litecoin) and more complex structures (like in-kind Bitcoin or staked ETFs) remains uncertain and subject to rigorous review. The SEC’s mandate is to protect investors and maintain fair and orderly markets. Their cautious approach reflects ongoing concerns about market volatility, potential manipulation, and the nascent nature of the crypto market compared to traditional finance. Each filing presents unique questions related to the specific asset, the proposed fund structure, custody arrangements, and surveillance sharing agreements. The acknowledgment of the staked TRX ETF suggests the industry is continuing to innovate and propose new ways for investors to gain exposure to crypto, pushing the boundaries of what regulators have previously considered. It opens the door, however slightly, to the possibility of ETFs that capture not just price appreciation but also native network yield. Actionable Insights for Investors What do these developments mean for you as an investor? Patience is Key: The regulatory process is slow. Don’t base investment decisions solely on anticipated ETF approvals or delays. Understand the Product: If and when new crypto ETFs are approved, take the time to understand their specific structure (e.g., spot vs. futures, cash vs. in-kind, staked vs. non-staked), fees, and underlying risks. Diversification: Don’t put all your hopes (or capital) into one specific asset based on ETF speculation. Maintain a diversified approach based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Stay Informed: Keep track of regulatory news from the SEC and other bodies. Regulatory clarity is a major factor influencing the maturation of the crypto market. Conclusion The recent actions by the SEC regarding various crypto ETF filings paint a clear picture of the current regulatory climate: cautious progress mixed with significant scrutiny. While delays for XRP ETF, Litecoin ETF, and in-kind Bitcoin ETF proposals highlight the ongoing hurdles for bringing novel crypto products to market, the acknowledgment of the first staked TRX ETF filing signals that the door is not entirely closed to innovation. These developments underscore the importance of regulatory milestones in the crypto industry’s journey towards mainstream adoption. As the SEC continues its review process, the market will be watching closely for further decisions that will shape the future of crypto investment products.

2025-05-23T01:30:29.000Z,"Bitcoin: Trump’s Bold Claim on US Dominance in Crypto Explained","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: Trump’s Bold Claim on US Dominance in Crypto Explained In a recent statement that has captured the attention of the digital asset world, former U.S. President Donald Trump asserted that the United States is currently ‘dominating’ in the realm of Bitcoin and crypto . This bold claim, reportedly made by Trump and shared by Watcher Guru on X, included a promise to ‘keep it that way.’ But what does this assertion really mean for the rapidly evolving landscape of digital currencies in the US ? What Does “Dominating” Mean for US Crypto? When a figure like Trump speaks about the US ‘dominating’ in Bitcoin and crypto , it can be interpreted in several ways. It could refer to the sheer size of the American market, the level of innovation happening within the country, or perhaps a political stance aimed at fostering growth and leadership in the sector. The US is undoubtedly a major player, boasting significant institutional investment, a large base of retail investors, and numerous blockchain companies pushing technological boundaries. Market Size: The US holds a substantial portion of the global crypto market capitalization and trading volume. Innovation Hub: Silicon Valley and other tech centers are home to many leading blockchain and crypto startups. Institutional Adoption: American financial institutions have shown increasing interest and involvement in Bitcoin and other digital assets. Talent Pool: The US attracts top talent in blockchain development and cryptography. However, the idea of ‘dominance’ is complex. While the US has strengths, it also faces significant challenges, particularly concerning regulation . The Impact of US Regulation on Crypto Dominance One of the most frequently discussed aspects of the US crypto market is its regulatory environment. Unlike some other countries that have established clear frameworks, the US approach has often been described as fragmented and uncertain. Various agencies, including the SEC, CFTC, and Treasury, have asserted jurisdiction, leading to confusion and sometimes conflicting guidance. This regulatory uncertainty can be seen as both a challenge and, paradoxically, a driver of innovation (as companies navigate complex rules). However, many in the industry argue that clearer, more predictable regulation is essential for the US to truly maintain or enhance its leading position. For instance, the ongoing debates surrounding whether certain cryptocurrencies are securities or commodities, and the lack of a clear path for registering and operating crypto businesses, can hinder growth and potentially push innovation offshore. Trump ‘s statement suggests a desire for the US to be a leader, which implies a need to address these regulatory hurdles effectively. Trump’s Evolving Stance on Bitcoin and Crypto Interestingly, Trump ‘s public stance on Bitcoin and crypto has evolved over time. Previously, he expressed skepticism, even calling Bitcoin a ‘scam against the dollar.’ His current position, emphasizing US dominance and the intent to ‘keep it that way,’ signals a significant shift. This evolution likely reflects the growing mainstream acceptance of digital assets and their increasing relevance in the global economy and political discourse. His current view aligns more closely with a segment of the Republican party that is increasingly vocal about supporting crypto innovation and pushing back against what they see as overreaching regulation from agencies like the SEC. This political alignment could have significant implications for future policy if he were to return to office. Why is US Leadership in Crypto Important? Maintaining a leading position in the Bitcoin and crypto space is seen by proponents as crucial for the US economy and its future competitiveness. Leadership in this sector can translate into: Economic Growth: Fostering the growth of crypto companies creates jobs and stimulates investment. Technological Advantage: Being at the forefront of blockchain technology ensures the US remains a global leader in digital innovation. Financial Inclusion: Digital assets can potentially offer new avenues for financial services to underserved populations. National Security: A strong domestic crypto industry can be important for cybersecurity and countering illicit finance, though this is also a complex area of regulation . Trump ‘s emphasis on ‘dominance’ highlights the geopolitical and economic importance he now seems to place on this sector. Challenges to Maintaining Dominance Despite Trump ‘s optimistic outlook, the US faces several challenges in maintaining its perceived dominance: Regulatory Competition: Other countries and regions are actively creating clearer regulatory frameworks to attract crypto businesses. Talent Migration: Regulatory uncertainty can lead companies and talent to move to more favorable jurisdictions. Public Perception: Negative headlines related to scams or market volatility can impact broader adoption and political will. Infrastructure: Ensuring robust and secure digital infrastructure is essential for mass adoption. Effectively navigating these challenges will require coordinated efforts between policymakers, regulators, and the private sector. What’s Next for Bitcoin and Crypto in the US? Trump ‘s statement adds another layer to the ongoing political discussion surrounding Bitcoin and crypto in the US . As the country heads towards future elections, the stance of political leaders on digital assets is becoming an increasingly important factor for voters and the industry alike. His commitment to ‘keep it that way’ suggests a potential policy direction focused on fostering growth, although the specifics of how that would be achieved, particularly regarding regulation , remain to be seen. The conversation around US dominance in crypto is far from over. It involves complex interplay between technological innovation, market forces, and the ever-evolving landscape of regulation . Trump ‘s words serve as a reminder that digital assets are now firmly on the political radar, and future policies will significantly shape the country’s role in this global phenomenon. Conclusion Donald Trump ‘s recent assertion that the US is ‘dominating’ in Bitcoin and crypto is a notable moment, signaling a shift in his public stance and highlighting the growing political recognition of the sector’s importance. While the US has significant strengths contributing to its position, maintaining true dominance will require addressing persistent challenges, particularly the need for clear and effective regulation . The future of Bitcoin and crypto in the US will likely be shaped by continued technological advancement, market dynamics, and crucially, the policy decisions made by its leaders.

2025-05-23T01:30:10.000Z,"Bitcoin STH Still Holding Depite New ATH – Analyst Expects Profit Taking At $126K","Bitcoin has officially entered uncharted territory, breaking above its all-time high and reaching an impressive $111,888 earlier today. This marks the beginning of a new price discovery phase, igniting excitement across the market. While bulls remain firmly in control, sentiment is far from euphoric. Many analysts are urging caution, expecting a possible retrace as the market digests this breakout. Top analyst Axel Adler shared timely insights, emphasizing that the sustainability of this rally hinges on the behavior of short-term holders (STH) and ETF speculators. According to Adler, the current STH MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) ratio has not yet crossed the “green” threshold of one standard deviation (+1 STDV), a level historically associated with “super rallies.” As of now, the data suggests that there is still room for further upside. However, the risk appetite of STH and ETF participants will likely determine whether Bitcoin continues climbing or pauses for a correction. With market sentiment cautious but optimistic, all eyes are on whether this breakout can transform into a sustained, high-momentum bull phase. Bitcoin STH Risk Appetite And ETF Flows May Dictate Next Move Bitcoin is showing remarkable strength as it pushes higher despite rising macroeconomic uncertainty. U.S. stocks fell sharply yesterday, rattled by surging Treasury yields that signaled tighter financial conditions ahead. Yet, in contrast, BTC has continued its climb, reaffirming its growing role as a hedge against traditional market volatility. Still, breaking above the $115,000 level remains critical. Without that breakout, Bitcoin risks losing momentum and facing a significant correction. Adler highlights that this rally hinges on the risk appetite of short-term holders (STH) and ETF-driven speculators. According to Adler, the current STH MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) metric has not yet crossed the “green” threshold of one standard deviation (+1 STDV). Historically, this level has marked the beginning of a “super rally,” a phase in which prices accelerate rapidly until STH holders begin profit-taking. In previous rallies of this cycle, Bitcoin surged an average of 46% above the +1 STDV line. Based on today’s data, this would project a potential high near $154,000. However, Adler warns that the current late-stage environment could curb gains. He anticipates selling to begin around $126,000, particularly from ETF buyers who entered around the $84,000 mark. While STH holders may be willing to ride out higher prices, ETF speculators could become the pressure point. Their exits may trigger the next correction, reinforcing the need for strong buying volume to sustain the breakout. As Bitcoin navigates new highs, market behavior will likely hinge on how both groups react to mounting gains. Technical Details: BTC Enters Price Discovery Bitcoin has officially entered price discovery after breaking above its previous all-time high, reaching $111,888 earlier today. The chart shows a strong bullish structure supported by rising volume and higher lows since the breakout above $100,000 in early May. The momentum has been consistent, with BTC holding well above its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $93,413 and the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $89,106, which now act as strong macro supports. After clearing the $103,600 resistance zone cleanly, Bitcoin continued to climb with minimal retracement, signaling strong buying interest and low overhead supply. The absence of major resistance in this new range increases the likelihood of further upside. However, RSI-based overheating or funding rate spikes could soon act as short-term obstacles. Despite the bullish momentum, it’s important to watch for any bearish divergences or signs of exhaustion near the psychological $115,000 level. A close above that mark with strong volume would likely extend the rally into the $120,000–$130,000 range. On the downside, the $103,600 and $100,000 levels now serve as crucial support zones. If bulls can maintain this structure and volume remains favorable, the breakout could lead to a sustained leg up in this cycle.

2025-05-23T01:14:30.000Z,"Michigan lawmakers file 4 crypto bills on retiree funds, CBDCs, mining","Michigan lawmakers have introduced four crypto-related bills covering crypto mining, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and crypto in state retirement funds. Republican state Representative Bill Schuette introduced House Bill 4510 on May 21, which would amend Michigan’s Public Employee Retirement System Investment Act to allow the state treasurer, currently Rachael Eubanks, to invest in cryptocurrencies that have averaged a market cap above $250 million over the last calendar year. Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) are the only cryptocurrencies that currently meet that threshold. The bill adds that any cryptocurrencies must be held in the form of an exchange-traded product issued by a registered investment company. A similar bill was introduced in February, permitting the state treasurer to allocate up to 10% of Michigan’s Budget Stabilization Fund into crypto. Republican Representative Bryan Posthumus led the introduction of the second bipartisan crypto bill on May 21, HB 4511 , which would prohibit Michigan from banning crypto or imposing licensing requirements on crypto holders. It would also prohibit state officials from advocating or supporting a proposed CBDC from the federal government. The bill defines advocating or supporting a CBDC to involve issuing a memorandum or official statement endorsing a CBDC proposal related to its testing, adoption or implementation. Source: Bitcoin Laws Michigan to consider two crypto mining bills HB 4512 , the third crypto bill introduced by a bipartisan group led by Democratic Representative Mike McFall, would create a Bitcoin mining program allowing operators to set up at abandoned oil and gas sites.

2025-05-23T01:00:33.000Z,"US Stock Market: Crucial Day Ends Mixed, What It Means for Crypto","BitcoinWorld US Stock Market: Crucial Day Ends Mixed, What It Means for Crypto Hey crypto enthusiasts! While your focus might be firmly on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the latest altcoin moves, paying attention to the broader financial landscape, particularly the US Stock Market , is absolutely crucial. Why? Because what happens in traditional markets often sends ripples into the world of digital assets. Today, the major U.S. stock indexes closed with a decidedly mixed performance, leaving many investors wondering about the signals this sends. Let’s dive into the details and explore what this could potentially mean for your crypto portfolio. Breaking Down the Numbers: Nasdaq Performance , S&P 500 Index , and Dow Jones Industrial Average Let’s look at the specifics of how the three main U.S. stock indexes wrapped up the trading day. It wasn’t a unified move; instead, we saw a bit of a split decision among these market bellwethers. Here’s the quick rundown: S&P 500 Index : Closed down slightly, posting a -0.04% change. This index is often seen as a broad gauge of the U.S. equity market, representing the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies. A slight dip here suggests a touch of caution or sector-specific weakness. Nasdaq Performance : Stood out with a positive move, gaining +0.28%. The Nasdaq Composite is heavily weighted towards technology and growth stocks. Its positive close could indicate continued strength or renewed investor interest in the tech sector, which often has closer ties to the risk-on sentiment that can also benefit crypto. Dow Jones Industrial Average : Finished essentially flat, showing a -0.00% change. The Dow tracks 30 large, publicly-owned companies based in the United States. Its near-unchanged state suggests stability among some of the nation’s industrial and established giants, but also a lack of strong directional conviction. Here’s that data in a simple table format: Index Daily Change S&P 500 -0.04% Nasdaq +0.28% Dow Jones -0.00% This mixed picture from the US Stock Market tells us that investors weren’t universally buying or selling across the board. There were likely specific sectors or individual company news driving these differing outcomes. Why is the US Stock Market Performance So Important for Crypto? You might wonder why a crypto news site is focusing on the traditional stock market. Great question! Historically, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have shown varying degrees of correlation with the US Stock Market , particularly with tech-heavy indexes like the Nasdaq. Here’s why this relationship matters: Investor Sentiment: Both stocks (especially growth stocks) and cryptocurrencies are often considered ‘risk-on’ assets. When investor confidence is high and they are comfortable taking on more risk, both markets can benefit. Conversely, during periods of fear or uncertainty, investors tend to move towards ‘risk-off’ assets like bonds or cash, selling off both stocks and crypto. Macroeconomic Factors: Big economic news – like inflation data, interest rate decisions by the Federal Reserve, or jobs reports – impacts both traditional financial markets and the crypto space. A mixed stock market close might reflect investor indecision or differing interpretations of recent economic signals, which can also create uncertainty in the crypto market. Liquidity: Global liquidity conditions, influenced by central bank policies, affect how much capital is available to flow into various asset classes, including both stocks and crypto. Institutional Adoption: As more large institutions invest in crypto, their portfolio decisions are often guided by broader market conditions and their performance in traditional assets. If their stock holdings are under pressure, it might influence their crypto strategy. While crypto aims to be a decentralized alternative, it currently operates within the broader global financial ecosystem. Therefore, understanding the pulse of the US Stock Market provides valuable context. The Big Question: What is the Potential Crypto Market Impact ? Given the mixed close in the US Stock Market , what could this mean for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the rest of the crypto market? It’s rarely a simple one-to-one relationship, but we can draw some potential connections: Ambiguity Reigns: A mixed day in stocks often translates to a lack of clear direction in crypto as well. The conflicting signals from the S&P 500/Dow vs. Nasdaq reflect underlying uncertainties that likely affect crypto investor sentiment similarly. Nasdaq’s Tech Influence: The positive Nasdaq Performance could be seen as a cautiously positive signal for crypto, given the historical correlation between tech growth stocks and digital assets. If the optimism in tech persists, it might spill over into crypto. No Strong Catalyst: A mixed close doesn’t provide a strong bullish or bearish catalyst from the traditional finance side. This means the crypto market might continue to trade based more on its own internal factors, like network developments, regulatory news, or specific tokenomics updates. Potential for Decorrelation: Sometimes, during periods of uncertainty in traditional markets, crypto can start to move independently, acting as an alternative investment class. A mixed stock market day, lacking a clear panic or euphoria, could be one such period where crypto charts its own course. However, strong evidence of sustained decorrelation is still debated. The key takeaway is that a mixed stock market close suggests caution and division among traditional investors. This sentiment often mirrors, or at least influences, the mood within the crypto community, leading to potentially sideways price action or increased volatility as traders react to conflicting signals. Actionable Insights: Navigating Markets When the US Stock Market is Mixed As a crypto investor, how should you approach days like this when the US Stock Market sends mixed signals? Here are a few actionable tips: Stay Informed on Macro: Don’t just watch crypto charts. Keep an eye on major economic news releases (inflation, jobs, Fed speeches). These are often the underlying drivers affecting both markets. Watch Key Correlation Points: Pay attention to how Bitcoin reacts specifically to significant moves in the Nasdaq. Is the historical correlation holding, weakening, or strengthening? Focus on Crypto Fundamentals: When external signals are mixed, internal crypto factors become more important. Research project developments, adoption rates, regulatory clarity, and network activity. Manage Risk: Mixed markets can be volatile. Ensure your portfolio is diversified (within crypto and potentially across asset classes if that’s your strategy) and consider using risk management tools like stop-losses. Avoid making impulsive decisions based solely on a single day’s mixed stock performance. Long-Term Perspective: For long-term crypto investors, a mixed day in stocks is just noise. Focus on your investment thesis for the digital assets you hold. Understanding the interplay between traditional finance and crypto is part of becoming a more informed and resilient investor in the digital asset space. The mixed close in the US Stock Market today serves as a reminder that these connections exist and are worth monitoring. In conclusion, the day’s mixed performance across the US Stock Market indexes – with the Nasdaq showing modest gains while the S&P 500 and Dow remained near flat – reflects a complex picture in traditional finance. While not a direct command signal for crypto, this lack of clear direction in stocks often contributes to uncertainty or sideways movement in the digital asset market. The potential Crypto Market Impact is likely one of cautious observation, with investors weighing the Nasdaq’s positive performance against the broader market’s indecision. Keeping an eye on these traditional indicators, alongside core crypto developments, remains a prudent approach for navigating the interconnected financial world.

2025-05-23T01:00:27.000Z,"Analysts Project a 13,000% Window: MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Cardano May Be Lining Up for Explosive Action","As the crypto market gears up for a potentially explosive second half of 2025, analysts are highlighting a rare convergence of high-upside opportunities. MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Cardano (ADA) are now at the center of attention, with projections suggesting a combined window for gains that could reach 13,000% for early entrants. While Bitcoin and Ethereum provide stability and institutional support, MAGA’s presale momentum and aggressive ROI forecasts are making it the breakout contender for those seeking exponential returns. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Early-Stage Presale With 13,000%+ Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as one of the most compelling presale projects of 2025, with over $8 million raised and its price still under $0.001 as Stage 8 nears completion. Analysts are projecting up to 18,500% potential returns, with many conservative models settling around a 13,000%–15,000% upside window based on listing targets, community growth, and scarcity-driven tokenomics. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political meme appeal are driving rapid accumulation by both retail and institutional investors. As Stage 8 fills and the $0.007 listing target approaches, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being positioned as a rare ground-floor opportunity—one that could rival the early days of SHIBA INU or DOGE, but with a more transparent structure and scarcity-driven upside. XRP: Bullish Catalysts and Institutional Momentum XRP is trading above $2.30, buoyed by legal clarity, the launch of CME futures, and ongoing ETF speculation. Analysts forecast a move to $2.80–$3.40 by early June, with some optimistic scenarios targeting $4.50 if bullish momentum persists. The recent conclusion of Ripple’s SEC lawsuit and confirmation that XRP is not a security have removed major overhangs, setting the stage for further institutional adoption. While XRP’s upside is strong, its growth potential pales in comparison to the exponential returns possible with early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the window for outsized gains is still wide open. Cardano: Technical Setup and Growth Forecast Cardano (ADA) is showing strong technical signals, with a double bottom on the weekly chart and a bullish outlook for 2025. Analysts predict ADA could range from $0.66 to $1.88 this year, with a stretched bullish target of $2.36 if key support levels hold. While ADA remains a favorite for long-term holders, its near-term upside is less dramatic compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. As capital rotates into high-upside plays, many Cardano holders are now diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE to maximize portfolio growth. Bitcoin and Ethereum: Macro Anchors With Rotating Capital Bitcoin (BTC) remains the market’s foundation, trading above $100,000 and drawing record inflows from institutional investors. Analysts forecast a possible run to $250,000 by year-end if current momentum holds. Ethereum (ETH) is holding steady near $2,600, with bullish technicals and ongoing upgrades supporting its long-term outlook. While both BTC and ETH are core holdings for stability, the biggest near-term upside is shifting toward early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the risk/reward profile is far more compelling for growth-focused investors. Kaspa: Quiet Growth, But MAGA Steals the Spotlight Kaspa (KAS) is gaining traction for its blockDAG architecture and scalability, but its price action remains subdued compared to the explosive presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. As capital seeks sharper returns, MAGA’s early-stage appeal and viral narrative are making it the go-to allocation for traders chasing the next 10x–50x winner. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion Analysts are projecting a 13,000% window for early entrants in MAGACOIN FINANCE, with XRP and Cardano also positioned for significant gains as the market heats up. With Stage 8 nearly full, a $0.007 listing target, and a rapidly growing community, MAGA stands out as the top early-stage opportunity of 2025. For those seeking the next top presale winner, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the name on every analyst’s and trader’s watchlist.

2025-05-23T01:00:00.000Z,"Whales Are Rotating Into MUTM as BTC Nears $110K — And That Says a Lot About Its 2025 Outlook","In recent weeks, a shift in capital flow has become increasingly clear. While retail investors continue to chase post-breakout momentum, whale wallets — those holding significant amounts of capital — are making more deliberate moves. One of the clearest signals? Large holders are beginning to rotate into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) while Bitcoin edges closer to $110,000. This isn’t random. Whales are known for positioning early, often ahead of the broader market. Their entry into MUTM speaks volumes about how this DeFi crypto project is being valued behind the scenes — especially with its fundamentals strengthening and its utility set to go live by the time the token launches. For many investors tracking the top cryptocurrencies showing early momentum, this is a signal worth noting. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance has already completed Phase 4 of its presale, raising nearly $9 million and attracting over 11,000 holders. The token price has risen from $0.025 to $0.03, and with a launch price confirmed at $0.06, investors buying now are already positioned for a 100% surge by the time it hits public exchanges. Despite this increase, the current price is still seen as a favorable entry — especially by large wallets that recognize the value of locking in upside before listings. With 11 presale phases in total, the early momentum has been strong, but there’s still room for newcomers to enter before the next price jump. For those wondering what crypto to buy now, MUTM is quickly emerging as one of the most talked-about new tokens in the market. One major factor behind whale interest is the dual lending architecture of the platform. Mutuum provides users with access to both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models. In the P2C model, users deposit assets into a shared liquidity pool and earn yield based on pool usage. Interest rates adjust dynamically depending on how much of the pool is borrowed, offering a passive, automated earning mechanism. The P2P model, however, introduces even more flexibility. Users can negotiate terms directly with one another, allowing for tailored agreements. This is particularly appealing for tokens that don’t fit neatly into conventional lending frameworks — including memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) or Dogecoin (DOGE). Through this system, borrowers and lenders can interact around volatile or niche assets while avoiding the limitations of centralized matching. Whales understand the value of that flexibility — especially in a DeFi crypto market where capital efficiency and asset diversity are becoming more important than ever. It’s one reason MUTM is being highlighted on lists of top crypto to buy among early investors looking beyond short-term hype. BTC Nears $110K — But Smart Capital Is Already Rotating As of this week, Bitcoin is nearing the $110,000 mark, continuing its climb following a wave of institutional inflows and expanding ETF activity. While this movement has captured headlines, the price increase is no longer unexpected — the uptrend has been building for months. What is more noteworthy is where strategic capital is now flowing. Instead of allocating heavily to BTC at elevated levels, larger wallets are starting to diversify into tokens like MUTM, where the growth potential from current pricing is substantially greater. For those looking for the best cheap crypto to buy now, this rotation is becoming increasingly significant. Stablecoin Development Adds Even More Depth Another reason whales are leaning in? Mutuum Finance’s overcollateralized stablecoin is currently under development. This new token will be minted directly from excess collateral within the lending protocol and pegged algorithmically to the U.S. dollar. Unlike centralized stablecoins or opaque algorithmic models, Mutuum’s approach is fully decentralized and backed on-chain. When borrowers provide collateral to mint the stablecoin, they’re interacting with smart contracts that ensure the supply remains overcollateralized at all times. This stablecoin will offer an additional layer of utility, creating a dependable medium of exchange within the ecosystem while also boosting liquidity. For investors exploring what cryptocurrency to invest in today, real-time utility like this adds a level of practicality that goes beyond pure speculation. With utilities going live at launch, presale momentum building, and institutional-style accumulation happening early, analysts now believe that MUTM would surge by up to 2300% shortly after listing. From its current presale price of $0.03, that would place the token around $0.72, potentially even higher if exchange support aligns with projected timelines. For example, a $750 investment at $0.03 would yield $17,250 when the token hits that $0.72 mark — a level some forecasts consider conservative when factoring in platform usage and liquidity flow. This kind of projection is why some now include MUTM in discussions of the next big cryptocurrency poised for breakout performance. While Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines with new highs, serious investors are already looking for the best crypto to invest in with longer-term upside — and the data shows they’re finding it in MUTM. With whales rotating in ahead of listings, a platform launch on the horizon, and mechanisms already in place to support long-term value, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as more than just a presale — it’s shaping up to be a central player in DeFi’s next wave. And for those paying attention now, it’s still early.

2025-05-23T00:30:58.000Z,"Bitcoin’s Breakout to $111K Sets the Stage — MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP Could Be the Next to Explode","Bitcoin’s historic surge above $111,000 has sent shockwaves through the crypto market, confirming a new phase of bullish momentum. As institutional inflows and regulatory optimism fuel BTC’s rally, attention is rapidly shifting toward high-upside altcoins. MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP are now at the center of analyst discussions, with both seen as leading candidates for the next explosive breakout in 2025. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Powerhouse With 18,500% Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the standout presale of 2025, with over $8 million raised and its presale price still under $0.001. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political meme appeal are driving rapid community growth and early-stage investor participation. Analysts are projecting up to 18,500% potential returns, with some calling a $1 target by year-end “not out of reach” given current momentum. As Stage 8 nears completion and the $0.007 listing target approaches, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being positioned as a rare ground-floor opportunity—one that could rival the early days of SHIBA INU or DOGE, but with a more transparent structure and scarcity-driven upside. With whale allocations and rapid presale sellouts highlighting strong conviction, MAGA stands out as the top breakout contender for Q3. XRP: Bullish Structure and Institutional Catalysts XRP has surged over 300% since late 2024 and is now consolidating near $2.35, with whale accumulation and renewed institutional interest following the launch of CME futures and ongoing ETF speculation. Analysts forecast a move to $2.80–$3.40 by early June, with some optimistic scenarios targeting $4.50 if bullish momentum persists. Positive regulatory developments—including the conclusion of Ripple’s SEC lawsuit and confirmation that XRP is not a security—have removed major overhangs, setting the stage for further institutional adoption. As capital rotates from Bitcoin into high-upside altcoins, XRP is increasingly viewed as a core holding for those seeking both stability and significant upside. Bitcoin: The Macro Anchor With Record Institutional Demand Bitcoin’s rally to $111,000 is fueled by unprecedented institutional inflows, robust ETF adoption, and a wave of optimism around regulatory clarity. With spot Bitcoin ETFs attracting billions in fresh capital and major financial players like BlackRock leading the charge, BTC’s dominance is undeniable. However, as Bitcoin stabilizes and its market cap grows, the biggest near-term upside is shifting toward early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the risk/reward profile is far more compelling for growth-focused investors. Solana and Aptos: Strong Fundamentals, but MAGA Steals the Spotlight Solana (SOL) continues to lead among Layer-1 platforms, with strong DeFi usage, developer activity, and whale accumulation supporting its price near $170. Aptos (APT) is also gaining traction with network upgrades and developer interest. Yet, as capital seeks sharper returns, both SOL and APT are being outpaced by the explosive presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is quickly becoming the go-to allocation for traders chasing the next 10x–50x winner. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Conclusion Bitcoin’s breakout to $111,000 has set the stage for a new wave of crypto growth, but the real excitement is building around MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP. With MAGA’s presale nearing completion and XRP’s bullish structure and institutional catalysts, both tokens are positioned for explosive gains in the coming months.

2025-05-23T00:30:39.000Z,"Bitcoin ATH Met With Mixed Whale Reactions – What’s The Market Signal?","Yesterday, Bitcoin (BTC) made a fresh all-time high (ATH) of $111,880 on Binance crypto exchange following months of downward action during the first quarter of the year. The leading cryptocurrency has rebounded over 45% from its April 6 low of approximately $76,000, and recent whale behavior suggests that long-term holders see further upside potential. Bitcoin ATH Sees Mixed Reaction From Whales According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Crazzyblockk, new whales – wallets that have held substantial BTC amounts for less than 30 days – have been aggressively taking profits during the current price rally, contributing to increased selling pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Demand Rises 3.4% As Small Investors Return To The Market – New ATH Soon? In contrast, old whales – wallets holding significant BTC for over six months – have shown minimal selling activity. This indicates long-term confidence in Bitcoin and expectations of continued price appreciation. Meanwhile, whales active between 7 to 30 days ago have engaged in moderate profit-taking, suggesting cautious participation in the ongoing rally. While the restrained activity from old whales is a positive signal, some indicators point to caution regarding the rally’s sustainability. For example, the Net Realized Profit/Loss (NRPL) during the current price surge is significantly lower than levels observed during previous 2024-2025 market tops. This indicates weaker overall profit-taking momentum among investors. For the uninitiated, NRPL measures the net profit or loss investors are locking in when they sell their Bitcoin, based on the price difference between acquisition and sale. A high NRPL indicates strong profit-taking behavior, while a low or negative NRPL suggests reduced enthusiasm or capitulation. Is The Market Headed Further Up? Although a low NRPL may imply that the market is not yet euphoric – a potentially healthy sign – it also raises concerns about the strength and sustainability of the ongoing rally. These dynamics could influence BTC’s price trajectory across different timeframes. Related Reading: Buy Bitcoin, Ditch The Banks Before It’s Too Late—Kiyosaki In the short-term, continued profit-taking by new whales may trigger a price correction to neutralize overheated market conditions. A drop in price could send BTC back to the $100,000-$105,000 support zone. In contrast, in the mid-term, the ongoing inactivity of old whales coupled with low NRPL levels could support a bullish continuation after a consolidation phase. Investors may view pullbacks as opportunities to accumulate more BTC. To conclude, while a short-term price correction remains possible, the mid-term outlook for Bitcoin is largely optimistic – assuming old whales maintain their positions and NRPL remains low. This aligns with recent on-chain analyses showing that many new BTC investors are sitting on solid unrealized gains and are not showing signs of panic selling, despite Bitcoin trading close to ATHs. At press time, BTC trades at $111,500, up 4.2% in the past 24 hours.

2025-05-23T00:20:39.000Z,"Bitcoin ETF In-Kind Redemption Delay: SEC’s Concerning Pause on Fidelity Funds","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin ETF In-Kind Redemption Delay: SEC’s Concerning Pause on Fidelity Funds Hey there, crypto enthusiasts and investors! We’ve got some significant news from the regulatory front that could impact how your spot Bitcoin ETF and potential Ethereum ETF investments function. According to reports circulating, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has apparently hit the pause button on approving the ‘in-kind’ redemption mechanism for Fidelity’s spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds. This isn’t just a technical hiccup; it’s a development with potential implications for the structure and, importantly, the tax efficiency of these popular investment vehicles. What Exactly Are In-Kind Redemptions for a Bitcoin ETF, and Why Do They Matter? Let’s break down what ‘in-kind’ redemptions mean in the context of an ETF. When you redeem shares of an ETF, you’re essentially selling them back to the fund. There are two primary ways this can happen: Cash Redemptions: The fund manager sells the underlying assets (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) and gives you cash in return for your shares. In-Kind Redemptions: Instead of selling the assets, the fund manager gives you a proportional amount of the actual underlying asset (Bitcoin or Ethereum) in exchange for your shares. This process typically happens between the ETF issuer and large institutional participants (Authorized Participants or APs), not individual retail investors directly. For a Bitcoin ETF or any commodity-based ETF, in-kind redemptions are generally considered the gold standard, primarily because of their impact on Crypto ETF tax efficiency . When a fund uses cash redemptions, selling the underlying asset can trigger capital gains taxes *within* the fund itself. These gains are then passed on to shareholders at the end of the year, potentially increasing your tax burden even if you haven’t sold your shares. In contrast, in-kind redemptions avoid this internal selling process, making the fund structure more tax-efficient for long-term holders. How Does the SEC Delay Impact Fidelity’s Ethereum ETF Aspirations? While spot Bitcoin ETF s are already trading, the regulatory path for a spot Ethereum ETF is still uncertain. Fidelity is among several firms that have filed for a spot Ethereum ETF. The reported SEC delay on in-kind redemptions for their *existing* Bitcoin ETF application (and presumably their Ethereum filing, which would likely seek similar redemption mechanisms) casts a shadow on how a future Ethereum ETF might operate if approved. If the SEC maintains its stance against in-kind redemptions, any approved spot Ethereum ETF from Fidelity (and potentially others) might be forced to operate solely on cash redemptions. This would mean investors in an Ethereum ETF could face the same potential tax inefficiencies as those in a cash-only Bitcoin ETF. Understanding the SEC Delay: What Are the Potential Reasons? The exact reasons behind the SEC delay aren’t always explicitly stated in these procedural pauses, but we can speculate based on the SEC’s past behavior and concerns regarding crypto. Potential reasons could include: Regulatory Caution: The SEC is notoriously cautious when it comes to cryptocurrencies. They may be scrutinizing the operational complexities and risks associated with fund managers directly handling and transferring volatile digital assets during redemptions. Market Manipulation Concerns: While spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved after addressing concerns about market surveillance, the SEC might still harbor worries about the potential for manipulation during large in-kind redemption processes, especially involving assets like Ethereum, which they have sometimes referred to as potentially being securities. Operational Logistics: Ensuring the seamless and secure transfer of Bitcoin or Ethereum from the fund to Authorized Participants during redemptions involves complex technical and custodial arrangements that the SEC might want to review thoroughly. Setting Precedent: The SEC’s decision on in-kind redemptions for Fidelity could set a precedent for other existing and future crypto ETFs, including those holding different digital assets. It’s important to remember that a delay is not an outright denial. It signifies that the SEC requires more time to review the specifics of the proposed mechanism and ensure it aligns with investor protection mandates and market integrity rules. Exploring Crypto ETF Tax Efficiency: Cash vs. In-Kind Redemptions Let’s delve a bit deeper into the tax implications, as this is arguably the most significant consequence for investors. Understanding Crypto ETF tax efficiency is crucial. Imagine a scenario where many investors decide to redeem their ETF shares. If the fund uses cash redemptions, the fund manager must sell a portion of the fund’s Bitcoin or Ethereum holdings to get the cash needed. If the price of Bitcoin or Ethereum has risen since the fund acquired those specific coins, selling them triggers a capital gain *inside* the fund. This gain is then distributed proportionally to all shareholders at the end of the year, regardless of whether those shareholders redeemed their shares or not. This can lead to unexpected tax bills for investors holding the ETF in taxable brokerage accounts. With in-kind redemptions, when an AP redeems shares, they receive Bitcoin or Ethereum directly from the fund’s holdings. No sale occurs *within* the fund itself to generate cash for the redemption. Therefore, no capital gains are realized at the fund level, and no capital gains distributions are passed on to remaining shareholders. This makes the in-kind structure significantly more tax-efficient, particularly for long-term investors. The SEC delay on approving this mechanism for Fidelity means that, for now, their ETFs may need to rely solely on cash redemptions, potentially impacting the tax efficiency compared to a scenario where in-kind was permitted. Actionable Insights: Navigating the In-Kind Redemptions Situation So, what does this mean for you as an investor or someone considering investing in a Bitcoin ETF or potential Ethereum ETF ? Understand the Redemption Mechanism: Check the prospectus or documentation for the specific ETF you hold or are considering. While the delay impacts Fidelity, other issuers might have different structures or be subject to similar reviews. Know if the fund uses cash or in-kind redemptions (or a mix). Consider Tax Implications: If a fund uses cash redemptions, be aware that you might receive capital gains distributions, even if you haven’t sold your shares. This is particularly relevant for holdings in taxable brokerage accounts. Consider holding periods and potential tax liabilities. Stay Informed: Regulatory decisions can change. Keep an eye on announcements from the SEC and ETF issuers regarding the approval status of in-kind redemptions. Consult a Tax Professional: Tax laws are complex, and the implications of ETF structures can vary based on your individual circumstances. A tax advisor can provide personalized guidance. The SEC delay highlights the ongoing complexities of integrating digital assets into traditional financial structures. While the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs was a major step, nuances like redemption mechanisms show that regulatory scrutiny remains high. In Conclusion: The SEC’s Pause and What It Signifies The reported SEC delay in approving in-kind redemptions for Fidelity’s spot Bitcoin ETF and potential Ethereum ETF is a notable development. While not halting the funds themselves (in the case of the Bitcoin ETF), it impacts a key structural feature that enhances Crypto ETF tax efficiency . This decision underscores the SEC’s cautious approach to the crypto market, scrutinizing operational details that are standard in other asset classes but raise unique questions when applied to volatile and novel digital assets. Investors should be mindful of the implications, particularly regarding potential tax outcomes, and stay informed as regulators continue to navigate the integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance.

2025-05-23T00:10:26.000Z,"SEC Ethereum ETF: Crucial Deadline Extension Sparks Uncertainty for Approval Hopes","BitcoinWorld SEC Ethereum ETF: Crucial Deadline Extension Sparks Uncertainty for Approval Hopes Crypto markets are once again focused on the regulatory calendar, specifically concerning the potential approval of a spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) in the United States. A recent development from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has added another layer of complexity and anticipation: the SEC has formally extended the review period for the 21Shares’ spot ETH ETF application, with particular attention being paid to the inclusion of staking features. This move wasn’t entirely unexpected, as the SEC often uses the full extent of its mandated review periods for complex or novel financial products. However, each extension serves as a fresh data point for market participants trying to gauge the likelihood and timing of potential ETH ETF approval. The decision specifically highlights the ongoing deliberations surrounding how staking, a core feature of Ethereum’s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, should be treated within an ETF structure. What’s the Latest on the SEC Ethereum ETF Review Process? The core news is straightforward: the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has pushed back the final deadline for its decision on the spot Ethereum ETF application filed by ARK Invest and 21Shares. While the original snippet focused solely on 21Shares, it’s crucial to note this application is a joint effort. The new deadline provides the regulator with additional time to evaluate the proposal, which includes provisions for staking a portion of the ETF’s held Ether. This particular application is one of several awaiting the SEC’s verdict. Filers like VanEck, BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, and others also have applications under review. The SEC’s process involves several stages, with initial deadlines, potential extensions, and finally, a definitive approval or disapproval order. This latest extension for the ARK 21Shares filing signals that the SEC is not yet ready to make a final call and requires more time to thoroughly examine the nuances of the proposal. Why is the SEC Deadline Extension Significant? Every SEC deadline, and subsequent extension, is closely watched by the market. Here’s why this particular SEC deadline extension for the ARK 21Shares application carries weight: Indicates Deliberation: Extensions typically mean the SEC is actively reviewing complex issues and hasn’t reached a conclusion. It suggests they are grappling with specific aspects of the filing rather than a simple rubber-stamp or outright rejection based on fundamental principles (though that remains a possibility). Focus on Staking: The SEC’s mention of the staking component in its extension order is particularly telling. It confirms that staking within an ETF structure is a primary area of regulatory focus and potential concern. This distinguishes the Ethereum ETF review significantly from the recently approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, as Bitcoin does not have a native staking mechanism. Sets a Precedent (Potentially): While each application is reviewed individually, decisions on one often influence others, especially for similar products. The outcome and reasoning behind the SEC’s decision on the ARK 21Shares application, particularly regarding staking, could provide insights into how other staked ETH ETF applications might be treated. Impacts Market Sentiment: Delays can sometimes dampen market enthusiasm built on anticipation of approval. Conversely, they can also be seen as the SEC doing its due diligence on a complex product, which some might view positively in the long run for market integrity. Understanding the SEC’s process is key here. The regulator is tasked with protecting investors and ensuring fair and orderly markets. When evaluating novel products like crypto ETFs, they look at market manipulation risks, liquidity, custody arrangements, and crucially, the nature of the underlying asset and any yield-generating features like staking. Understanding Ethereum ETF Staking and the Regulatory Hurdles One of the main points of discussion, and likely the primary reason for the SEC’s extended review, is the inclusion of staking in some of the proposed Ethereum ETFs. But what exactly does this mean, and why is it complicated? Ethereum transitioned from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism with ‘The Merge’. In PoS, instead of miners validating transactions, validators stake ETH to participate in the network’s consensus and earn rewards (yield). An Ethereum ETF staking feature would mean the fund manager could stake a portion of the Ether held by the ETF, potentially generating additional yield for the fund, which would then theoretically benefit the ETF holders. Here’s where the regulatory questions arise for the SEC Ethereum ETF review: Is Staking a Security? This is perhaps the most significant hurdle. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has previously indicated that he views many cryptocurrencies and features like staking as potentially falling under U.S. securities laws. If staking is deemed a security offering, including it in an ETF structure regulated under commodity laws (which is how spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved) becomes legally challenging. Custody and Control: Staking involves locking up assets and participating in network validation. This raises questions about who controls the staked ETH (the fund manager or a third-party validator?), the risks associated with slashing (penalties for validator errors), and the potential illiquidity of staked assets (though withdrawals are now enabled on Ethereum). Valuation and Accounting: How should the yield generated from staking be accounted for and distributed within the ETF structure? This adds complexity compared to a simple spot product that just holds the underlying asset. These questions are not trivial and require careful consideration by the SEC to ensure investor protection and regulatory compliance. The inclusion of staking is a double-edged sword for applicants: it could make the ETF more attractive by offering yield, but it also introduces significant regulatory complexity not present in Bitcoin ETFs. The Role of 21Shares ETH ETF Application in the Approval Race ARK Invest and 21Shares ETH ETF application is often seen as a bellwether in the race for crypto ETF approvals. 21Shares, often in partnership with ARK Invest, has been among the earliest and most persistent filers for various crypto-related ETFs in the U.S. Their spot Bitcoin ETF, ARKB, was part of the first cohort approved in January 2024. Because they are typically early filers, their application often reaches critical decision deadlines before others. While the SEC doesn’t necessarily have to approve or reject applications in the order they were filed, the decisions on earlier applications can sometimes signal the SEC’s general stance or reveal the specific points of contention they are focused on. The fact that the SEC specifically called out the staking component in the extension notice for the ARK 21Shares application confirms that staking is a central issue they are currently wrestling with across all relevant ETH ETF filings. Potential Outcomes and Actionable Insights for the Future of ETH ETF Given the continued SEC deadline extension and the focus on staking, what are the potential scenarios, and what does this mean for market participants interested in the future of the ETH ETF landscape? Potential Outcomes: There are a few main paths the SEC could take: Approval (Potentially Without Staking): The SEC could approve spot ETH ETFs but require applicants to remove the staking feature. This would simplify the regulatory analysis significantly, making approval more likely in the near term. Approval (Including Staking): Less likely in the immediate future given the apparent regulatory hurdles, but the SEC could find a path to approve ETFs that include staking, perhaps with specific limitations or structural requirements. This would be a major bullish catalyst. Further Delays: The SEC could issue more extensions for this and other applications if they feel they need more time or if the applicants need to amend their proposals significantly based on SEC feedback. Disapproval: The SEC could ultimately disapprove the applications, citing concerns about market manipulation, investor protection, or the legal status of Ether or staking. This would be a significant setback for the industry’s efforts to bring a spot ETH ETF to market. Actionable Insights: For investors and those watching the space, the current situation offers several takeaways: Stay Informed, Be Patient: The regulatory process is lengthy and unpredictable. Rely on reputable news sources and official SEC filings for updates. Understand the Staking Hurdle: Recognize that staking is the primary differentiator and potential roadblock compared to the approved Bitcoin ETFs. The SEC’s stance on this will likely determine the outcome for many applications. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Trading based purely on ETF approval speculation is highly risky. Understand the volatility inherent in crypto markets and regulatory news. Consider Alternatives: While waiting for a spot ETH ETF, investors interested in Ethereum can explore existing regulated products like futures-based ETH ETFs or gain direct exposure to ETH, understanding the associated risks and responsibilities (like self-custody). The road to a spot SEC Ethereum ETF in the U.S. is proving to be more complex than the path taken by Bitcoin. The regulatory focus on staking highlights the unique challenges posed by Ethereum’s network design. Conclusion: The Waiting Game Continues for ETH ETF Approval The SEC’s extension of the review deadline for the ARK 21Shares spot ETH ETF application, specifically mentioning the staking component, underscores the significant regulatory questions that still need to be resolved. While not a rejection, it confirms that the path to ETH ETF approval is not straightforward and is complicated by features unique to Ethereum’s proof-of-stake mechanism. The industry and investors will continue to watch the SEC’s next moves closely. The decisions made in the coming months regarding these applications, and particularly the stance taken on staking, will shape the future landscape of regulated Ethereum investment products in the United States. For now, the waiting game continues, with the regulatory process adding a layer of uncertainty to the highly anticipated prospect of a spot ETH ETF .

According to Reuters , the central bank’s monetary policy director, Nilton David, says that the financial institution does not expect the BRICS group of emerging nations to create markets large enough to topple the US dollar’s dominance within 10 years. David says that BRICS-denominated assets currently do not have meaningful stock to offset the US dollar. “I don’t think that will change over the coming decade.” He says that alternative settlement tools may gain traction and even improve bilateral trade deals, but they would not be enough to displace the US currency. The BRICS is an intergovernmental organization of 11 countries— Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, Indonesia and Iran. The group aims to strengthen the economic, political and social cooperation among its members and elevate the influence of Global South countries in international governance. The group does not have a common currency, but there are concerns that it will create one that can challenge the US dollar. During a 2023 summit, member nations discussed the issue of de-dollarization. US President Donald Trump has warned of repercussions if the alliance creates a new currency or backs one to replace the greenback.

2025-05-22T23:30:41.000Z,"Ethereum ETF: BlackRock’s Massive Accumulation Accelerates","BitcoinWorld Ethereum ETF: BlackRock’s Massive Accumulation Accelerates The world of finance is witnessing a significant shift as major institutional players increasingly turn their attention to digital assets. One such pivotal development is the consistent and substantial accumulation of Ethereum (ETH) by financial giants like BlackRock for their exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This trend signals growing confidence in the future of cryptocurrencies, particularly Ethereum, among traditional finance institutions. What Does BlackRock’s ETH Accumulation Mean? Recent data from Arkham Intelligence highlights BlackRock’s aggressive move into the Ethereum ETF space. The firm’s ETHA ETF has been actively accumulating ETH, marking a third consecutive day of significant purchases. On the latest day, BlackRock added an impressive 9,989 ETH to its holdings. This single purchase alone is valued at approximately $26.47 million, acquired directly from a Coinbase Prime hot wallet. This isn’t an isolated event. The prior two days also saw substantial inflows: Day 2: 5,449 ETH acquired Day 1: 8,162 ETH acquired Cumulatively, over just three days, BlackRock has added a total of 23,600 ETH to its ETF holdings, representing a total investment of approximately $60.81 million based on reported values at the time of purchase. This consistent pattern of buying underscores a strategic move by one of the world’s largest asset managers. Understanding Institutional Crypto Adoption BlackRock’s actions are a clear indicator of growing Institutional Crypto adoption. For years, cryptocurrencies were primarily viewed as retail investments or speculative assets. However, the successful launch and performance of Bitcoin ETFs, and now the anticipation and early movements around Ethereum ETFs, are changing this perception dramatically. Institutional adoption brings several potential benefits to the crypto market: Increased Legitimacy: Participation by trusted financial institutions lends credibility to the asset class. Greater Liquidity: Large-scale buying and selling can increase market depth and reduce volatility. Wider Accessibility: ETFs provide traditional investors with an easy, regulated way to gain exposure to crypto without directly managing private keys or wallets. Potential for Price Stability (Long-Term): As more capital flows in through regulated products, it could contribute to more stable price discovery over time. However, it’s also important to consider potential challenges: Market Influence: Large institutional moves can significantly impact market prices. Centralization Concerns: Concentration of assets in a few large funds could raise concerns about centralization of power. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased institutional involvement often brings greater regulatory attention and potential restrictions. The Significance of BlackRock’s ETH Accumulation BlackRock is not just any player; it manages trillions of dollars in assets. Their active buying of ETH for an ETH ETF sends a powerful signal to the market. It suggests that they view Ethereum as a viable, investable asset class with long-term potential. This consistent accumulation, particularly after the regulatory steps towards approving spot Ethereum ETFs, aligns with a strategy to build significant holdings in anticipation of or following broader market access. This pattern mirrors the lead-up to the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, where firms like BlackRock also accumulated substantial amounts of BTC. While the regulatory path for spot Ethereum ETFs in certain jurisdictions is still unfolding, BlackRock’s moves indicate proactive positioning. What This Means for Crypto Investment For individuals interested in Crypto Investment , BlackRock’s actions provide valuable insight into institutional sentiment. While retail investors have long been part of the Ethereum ecosystem, institutional participation through ETFs offers a new dynamic. It opens the door for pension funds, endowments, and wealth managers to allocate capital to ETH, potentially unlocking a massive pool of liquidity. The availability of an Ethereum ETF allows investors to gain exposure through traditional brokerage accounts, simplifying the process and potentially reducing perceived risks associated with direct crypto ownership. This could lead to increased demand for ETH, impacting its market dynamics. Analyzing the Data: A Closer Look at ETH Accumulation Let’s break down the recent ETH Accumulation by BlackRock’s ETF: Date (Approx.) ETH Acquired Approximate USD Value Source Most Recent Day 9,989 ETH $26.47 million Coinbase Prime Hot Wallet Previous Day 5,449 ETH ~ $14.45 million Not specified in snippet, likely similar Two Days Prior 8,162 ETH ~ $21.58 million Not specified in snippet, likely similar Total (3 Days) 23,600 ETH ~ $60.81 million (Note: USD values are based on the provided snippet’s figure for the latest day and approximate based on total value mentioned for the prior two days. Actual values fluctuate with market price.) This consistent buying pattern, totaling tens of millions of dollars over a short period, is a strong signal of persistent demand originating from BlackRock’s ETF operations. Conclusion: A New Era for Ethereum? BlackRock’s significant and continuous ETH Accumulation through its ETF is a landmark event for the cryptocurrency market. It underscores the growing appetite for digital assets among the world’s largest financial institutions and highlights Ethereum’s position as a key asset in this evolving landscape. While the full impact of widespread Institutional Crypto adoption via products like the Ethereum ETF remains to be seen, BlackRock’s actions suggest a future where crypto plays an increasingly integrated role in traditional investment portfolios. This ongoing trend is likely to be a major talking point and driver in the market for the foreseeable future.

(Source: Intelion Data Systems/YouTube/Screenshot.) This means that the nation’s vast illegal crypto mining sector is still largely unaccounted for. But the data also revealed how much power the country’s top crypto mining players use. It also reveals information about where the miners have built their biggest data centers and the types of energy mixes they use to power their rigs. The data shows that BitRiver’s revenue for 2024 was RUB 10.286 billion (over $129 million). The same company used 533 MW of electrical power in 15 data centers. BitRiver operates more than 175,000 crypto mining rigs and provides hosting and support to B2B clients. The firm continues to operate centers in Irkutsk Oblast , the nation’s first Bitcoin mining hub. In recent months, mining in Irkutsk has caused major strains on the Siberian grid.

2025-05-22T23:15:13.000Z,"Bitcoin Inches Toward All-Time High, While Cardano and Filecoin Lag—Qubetics Becomes Best Crypto Presale to Join In May 2025","With Bitcoin trading just 2% shy of its all-time high, the crypto market is sending shockwaves across global finance once again. ETFs alone have absorbed over $1 billion in BTC inflows in just two days, according to Decrypt, marking a blistering resurgence of institutional momentum. This renewed faith has reignited attention across altcoins, but not all are rising equally. Cardano gears up for a high-profile appearance at Gitex Europe 2025, while Filecoin struggles to shake off bearish pressure. Both projects are making waves—but for entirely different reasons. Meanwhile, a quieter revolution is unfolding. Qubetics ($TICS), a Web3 protocol still in presale, is now up to Stage 35, having raised over $17.2 million and sold more than 513 million tokens. It’s making its case not through buzzwords or flash but with serious infrastructure and a developer-first ecosystem. The best crypto presale to join in May 2025 isn’t being hyped on mainstream charts—it’s building something real, and the numbers don’t lie. The Rise of Qubetics: Why the First Web3 Aggregator Is Reshaping Blockchain Utility As buzz builds around blockchain utility, Qubetics isn’t just another coin promising lofty ideals. It delivers. Positioned as the world’s first Web3 aggregator, Qubetics creates a development backbone that pulls together Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos, Avalanche, and beyond into one frictionless framework. At the heart of this innovation lies QubeQode—a fully integrated, no-code/low-code IDE. This platform allows developers, agencies, and even non-technical entrepreneurs to deploy multi-chain applications faster than ever. Whether it’s a payment gateway for small businesses in Detroit, or a real estate tokenization platform in Miami, Qubetics cuts down dev time from weeks to hours. The Qubetics IDE goes a step further, offering robust analytics, real-time cross-chain debugging, and modular templates that can be adapted across industries. It’s not abstract talk—it’s a working solution for real-world deployment. For legacy industries and Web2 companies making the Web3 leap, this is the kind of stack that removes years of friction in a single leap. In this climate, it’s clear why Qubetics is being quietly hailed as the best crypto presale to join in May 2025 . Qubetics Presale Sets the Bar for ROI: Stage 35 Hits as Weekly Price Jumps Continue Qubetics Presale momentum shows no signs of slowing. Currently in Stage 35 at a price of $0.2785 per $TICS, the platform has now raised over $17.2 million, and onboarded 26,800+ holders. Each stage lasts just 7 days, and as of the last cutoff (Sunday, 12 a.m.), the price rose by 10%—as it has consistently every week. For early adopters buying at the current stage, the math gets exciting quickly. Let’s say a participant enters with $100: If $TICS hits $1 post-presale, that $100 becomes $358.95 If $TICS hits $5, it becomes $1,794.74 If $TICS reaches $6, the return stretches to $2,153.68 A $10 target after the mainnet launch in Q2 2025? That’s $3,589.47 And if Qubetics hits $15, you’re looking at $5,384.21 in return. These aren’t dreams—they’re projections grounded in utility, adoption trends, and an aggressively limited presale model. This combination of short-term growth with long-term infrastructure makes the Qubetics presale the standout choice right now. The price-to-value ratio, combined with the robust development tools and real-time utility, underpins why this remains the best crypto pre sale by a wide margin. Cardano to Headline Gitex Europe 2025—Strategic Exposure Amid Institutional Pivot to Europe On May 21st, 2025, Cardano is scheduled to participate in Gitex Europe, a global tech showcase taking place in Berlin. This isn’t just another speaking gig—it signals Cardano’s strategic alignment with the ongoing shift of U.S. corporations toward Europe for blockchain partnerships, as recently reported by Cryptopolitan. The presence of Cardano at this high-level forum places it in direct conversation with regulators, enterprise adopters, and tech stakeholders. What makes this significant is the timing. With the U.S. market tightening around compliance, Cardano’s European outreach looks like a well-calculated pivot. Gitex offers a perfect stage to present Cardano’s smart contract capabilities, scaling roadmap, and enterprise applications to a region where institutional interest is heating up. While this doesn’t directly translate to a price surge yet, the strategic optics are undeniable. It allows Cardano to reposition itself as an infrastructure partner for both public and private sector innovation in a maturing European blockchain market. But while it makes a strong show of intent, the lack of fresh protocol breakthroughs keeps its short-term price targets conservative for now. Filecoin Forecast Highlights Headwinds Despite Long-Term Utility Appeal Unlike Qubetics’ momentum or Cardano’s positioning, Filecoin is grappling with headwinds. According to the latest Capital.com analysis, Filecoin’s native token FIL has faced notable volatility. As of May 2025, FIL trades at $5.81, with trailing 12-month returns in the red. This decline is attributed to broader market swings and competition in the decentralized storage space. Analysts point to resistance around the $7.10 mark, and if it breaks above that, it could target $9.90. On the flip side, if bearish momentum holds, the support sits around $3.52, a drop that would raise red flags. This has kept short-term sentiment mixed despite Filecoin’s robust utility framework. Long-term, Filecoin still holds potential as decentralized data storage becomes a larger narrative. But its lack of near-term catalysts, combined with a sluggish recovery pace, makes it less appealing compared to presale tokens like Qubetics that offer immediate upside and future-ready infrastructure. While not out of the game, Filecoin currently sits on uncertain ground. Conclusion: Why May 2025 May Belong to the Quiet Movers In a market roaring with ETF flows, all-time high chatter, and multi-billion-dollar narratives, it’s the quiet builders like Qubetics that are carving out real momentum. As Cardano builds its institutional narrative and Filecoin navigates technical volatility, Qubetics is stacking presale milestones, delivering infrastructure, and preparing for a Q2 2025 mainnet launch with real-world utility at its core. This isn’t just another pump—it’s a development-layer revolution. With over $17.2M raised, weekly 10% jumps, and game-changing ROI math, Qubetics presale easily takes the crown as the best crypto presale to join in May 2025. As markets pivot and narratives shift, this project checks every box: application, roadmap, ROI, and timing. For those watching the top crypto presale opportunities with intent, the window is open—but not for long.

2025-05-22T23:00:57.000Z,"Bitcoin Golden Cross In Play – Analyst Reveals Best Course Of Action","Bitcoin’s price action in the past 24 hours has been nothing short of remarkable. After consolidating for several days in a tightening range, the market broke past the $105,503 support-turned-resistance zone earlier in the week and kicked off a steep climb in the past trading day. This has allowed Bitcoin to push into new all-time high levels, and is showing no signs of slowing down. Interestingly, technical analysis shows the rally comes off an approach of a golden cross between the 50 and 200-day moving averages, but FX_Professor offered a different take on the much-celebrated golden cross. Analyst Disputes Golden Cross Hype As Late Signal In a recent analysis published on TradingView, FX_Professor discussed a different take on Bitcoin’s golden cross. While most market commentators interpret this crossover of the 50-day simple moving average above the 200-day as a strong bullish confirmation, the analyst dismissed it as a delayed indicator. The analyst described it as the afterparty where retail investors arrive late to the scene. Related Reading: Golden Ratio Multiplier Called Bitcoin Top In 2021 – Here’s What It’s Saying Now Instead of waiting for the golden cross to flash green, FX_Professor noted pre-indicator pressure zones as the real signal of value. In the case of Bitcoin’s price action in recent months, the analyst pointed out the $74,394 and $79,000 region as the zone of accumulation and early positioning, well before the golden cross became visible. As such, by the time the cross appeared recently, Bitcoin’s price action had already been up significantly. The golden cross is often used by traders as a signal to enter a long position, as it suggests that the asset’s price is likely to continue rising. However, this analysis follows a trend among experienced traders who view the golden cross as more of a lagging confirmation than a trigger of a rally. Early Entry Zones And Structure Matter More, Analyst Says According to FX_Professor, indicators such as EMAs or SMAs can be useful but should never come before understanding the price structure, trendlines, and real-time pressure zones. He shared a snapshot of his own Bitcoin price chart that combines custom EMAs with a signature parallelogram method to detect where price tension begins to build. Visible on the chart are entries forming as early as April when Bitcoin bounced off support around $74,000, long before the crossover confirmation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Top Indicator Says It’s Not Over Yet As Parabola Signals Fail Now, with Bitcoin pushing toward the next target zone near $113,000, the analyst’s strategy continues to validate itself in real time. Nonetheless, the confirmation of a golden cross is still bullish for Bitcoin’s price action moving forward, even if the price rally is already halfway to its peak level. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $110,734. This marks a slight pullback from the new all-time high of $111,544, which was registered just three hours ago. The Bitcoin price is still up by 3.1% in the past 24 hours, and new all-time highs are possible before the weekly close.

2025-05-22T22:50:10.000Z,"Mantle mETH Achieves Historic Public Company Milestone","BitcoinWorld Mantle mETH Achieves Historic Public Company Milestone Get ready for a significant moment in the world of digital assets! A groundbreaking development has just unfolded, showcasing the increasing integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional finance. Mantle mETH, the liquid staking token from the Mantle Network, has achieved a historic first by being included on the balance sheet of a publicly traded company. This move by Beyond Medical Technologies, through its Ethereum treasury managed by Republic Technologies, marks a pivotal step for Liquid Staking Tokens and signals a potential shift in how public companies approach their treasury strategies. What is Mantle mETH and Why is it Making Waves? Before diving into the significance of this news, let’s quickly touch upon what Mantle mETH is. Mantle is a high-performance Ethereum Layer 2 network. mETH is Mantle’s Liquid Staking Token (LST), representing staked ETH on the Ethereum network while remaining liquid and usable within the DeFi ecosystem and beyond. Essentially, when you stake ETH, it’s typically locked. LSTs like mETH allow holders to earn staking rewards while still having a token they can trade, lend, or use in other decentralized applications. The reason Mantle mETH is making waves is precisely because of its recent adoption by a public company. This isn’t just another crypto project; it’s a project whose token has now entered the realm of traditional corporate finance, setting a precedent. The Significance: A Public Company Crypto Breakthrough? This news is huge because it represents the first time a publicly listed company has formally included a Liquid Staking Token on its balance sheet. While some public companies hold Bitcoin or Ethereum directly, holding an LST is a different ballgame. It indicates a deeper understanding and willingness to engage with more complex, yield-generating crypto assets. Beyond Medical Technologies (CSE: DOCT), through its Republic Technologies subsidiary, is the company making this bold move. By converting a significant portion of its existing ETH holdings into Mantle mETH, they are actively pursuing an Ethereum-based Crypto Treasury Strategy that aims to potentially generate yield on their assets while maintaining a degree of liquidity. Why is being the ‘first’ so important? It often paves the way for others. This action by Beyond Medical Technologies could serve as a case study or even a catalyst for other public companies considering how to manage their digital asset holdings more actively and efficiently. It lends an air of legitimacy and growing acceptance to LSTs within traditional financial frameworks. How Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) are Changing Treasury Strategy Traditionally, companies holding assets like cash or bonds aim for stability and potentially yield. With the advent of crypto, companies like MicroStrategy pioneered holding Bitcoin as a reserve asset. However, holding passive crypto assets doesn’t generate yield in the way traditional fixed-income assets might. This is where Liquid Staking Token s like Mantle mETH come into play. For companies holding Ethereum, they face a choice: Hold ETH passively (potential price appreciation, but no native yield). Stake ETH directly (earn yield, but ETH is locked and illiquid). Hold an LST like mETH (earn staking yield *and* retain liquidity). By opting for mETH, Republic Technologies is demonstrating a sophisticated Crypto Treasury Strategy . They are not just holding ETH; they are actively seeking to maximize the utility and potential returns on their digital assets by participating in the staking mechanism through a liquid wrapper. This allows them flexibility that direct staking doesn’t offer, such as potentially using the mETH as collateral or swapping it quickly if needed, while still benefiting from the underlying ETH staking rewards. What This Means for Institutional Crypto Adoption This move by a public company is a significant indicator for broader Institutional Crypto Adoption . Institutions often move cautiously, waiting for precedents and clearer regulatory landscapes. While Beyond Medical Technologies is perhaps not a Fortune 500 giant, their decision to hold an LST on their balance sheet sends a strong signal: Increased Comfort Level: It shows a growing comfort among corporate entities with more complex DeFi primitives beyond just holding spot crypto. Focus on Yield: It highlights that institutions are interested not just in speculative price action but also in generating yield from their digital assets, similar to traditional finance. Validation for LSTs: It validates the LST market as a legitimate and potentially valuable sector for corporate involvement. Paving the Way: As mentioned, it could encourage other companies, perhaps larger ones, to explore similar strategies once they see a public company successfully implementing it. While we are still in the early innings of widespread Institutional Crypto Adoption , events like this are crucial steps that build confidence and familiarity with the technology and its potential benefits. Benefits and Considerations for Companies Holding mETH Let’s break down some of the potential upsides and downsides for a company deciding to hold a Liquid Staking Token like Mantle mETH. Potential Benefits: Yield Generation: Earn staking rewards on underlying ETH holdings. Liquidity: Unlike directly staked ETH, mETH can be traded or used in DeFi protocols, offering flexibility. Diversification: Adds a new asset class and yield source to the corporate balance sheet. Potential Appreciation: Benefits from potential price increases in both ETH and potentially the mETH token itself relative to ETH (though the latter is designed to track ETH value plus yield). Alignment with Ethereum Strategy: For companies already invested in the Ethereum ecosystem, holding mETH aligns with and enhances that position. Important Considerations & Risks: Market Volatility: The value of mETH is tied to ETH, which is highly volatile. Smart Contract Risk: LSTs rely on complex smart contracts. Bugs or exploits could lead to loss of funds. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory status of LSTs and corporate crypto holdings is still evolving in many jurisdictions. Operational Complexity: Managing digital assets requires specialized knowledge, security protocols, and accounting practices. Depeg Risk: While LSTs are designed to trade close to the value of staked ETH, they can sometimes trade at a discount or premium (depeg risk). For Beyond Medical Technologies, the decision likely involved weighing these factors as part of their overall Crypto Treasury Strategy . Looking Ahead: The Future of LSTs in Corporate Finance The integration of Mantle mETH onto a public company’s balance sheet is more than just a single event; it’s a potential harbinger of future trends. As the LST market matures and becomes more robust, and as regulatory clarity hopefully improves, we might see more companies exploring similar strategies. The appeal of earning yield on otherwise passive crypto holdings is significant, especially in a low-interest-rate environment (or when compared to zero yield on passive crypto). This move by Beyond Medical Technologies, facilitated by Republic Technologies and Mantle, positions LSTs as a viable tool within a sophisticated Crypto Treasury Strategy for forward-thinking companies. While widespread Public Company Crypto adoption of LSTs is not guaranteed, this milestone is undoubtedly a step in that direction, showcasing the potential for DeFi innovations to bridge the gap with traditional corporate finance. Summary: A Historic Step for Mantle mETH and LSTs In conclusion, Mantle mETH has achieved a historic first by becoming the inaugural Liquid Staking Token to be held on the balance sheet of a publicly traded company, Beyond Medical Technologies, through its Republic Technologies subsidiary. This move represents a sophisticated Crypto Treasury Strategy aimed at generating yield while retaining liquidity on their ETH holdings. It is a significant milestone for Institutional Crypto Adoption and validation for the LST sector, potentially paving the way for other companies to explore similar uses of Public Company Crypto assets. While challenges remain, this event underscores the growing maturity and potential of DeFi technologies to integrate with traditional finance.

2025-05-22T22:35:24.000Z,"Ethereum’s trillion-dollar rebrand masks deep trouble as Solana eats its lunch","Ethereum is trying to clean up its image just as it’s losing its grip. The Ethereum Foundation launched a campaign in 2025 called the “Trillion Dollar Security Initiative” to promote the blockchain as the only serious option for securing real-world value. But the effort comes at a time when the project is slipping across the board, from price performance to user attention and developer support, while Solana is gaining fast. The message coming from Ethereum’s leadership is all about stability, uptime, and security. But Ether, the token that runs on it, hasn’t kept up with Bitcoin since the Merge upgrade was rolled out in 2022. The gap has only widened. The Ether-to-Bitcoin price ratio has stayed on a downward slope since then, and Ethereum has struggled to pull in new interest even as it added new tech upgrades. Instead of regaining momentum, it has seen core users and builders Ethereum’s leadership walk away. Solana gains traction while Ethereum loses ground In 2024, Solana’s active developer count jumped by 83%, while Ethereum’s dropped by 17%, data from Electric Capital showed. Cheaper fees and better user experience on Solana have pulled in a younger crowd that’s more focused on speed, memecoins, and new ideas than Ethereum’s long-term vision. That same audience drove Solana’s price to an all-time high earlier this year while Ether stayed mostly flat. Ethereum’s ecosystem has gotten too fragmented, and developers are opting out of dealing with Layer-2 rollups like Base and Arbitrum just to get basic dApps running. Even the Ethereum Foundation’s own move to promote security is being questioned. Katie Talati, head of research at Arca, said the new initiative was less of a breakthrough and more of a branding effort. “This feels more like a marketing repositioning from the Ethereum Foundation than an actual technical innovation,” Katie said . “I don’t believe that this announcement alone will be enough to recapture developer and user mindshare. But over the long term, a greater focus on security guarantees via improvements to UX/UI will attract more developers. Users, however, only come when there is something interesting to use.” Part of Ethereum’s current struggle comes from its scaling progress. After the Dencun upgrade last year, Ethereum did make progress on moving activity off the main chain. But most of that activity landed on Layer-2s. The core network hasn’t kept that momentum, and as a result, Ether’s burn rate has dropped. That weakens the coin’s previous deflationary pitch, one of the key reasons investors used to hold it in the first place. Wall Street push fails to spark interest in Ether ETFs Now, Ethereum’s leaders are chasing attention in Washington and on Wall Street. A group called Etherealize, formed with support from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and led by researcher Vivek Raman, is focused on lobbying for the blockchain’s future in traditional finance. Vivek explained the strategy in an email, saying, “We speak to TradFi and Wall Street players all day and in the end — a blockchain’s security is the most important quality to ensure trust.” He added that Ethereum’s role will be as “digital oil” to complement Bitcoin’s role as “digital gold.” That narrative hasn’t worked out well so far. In 2025, spot Ether ETFs in the US saw $42 million in net outflows. At the same time, Bitcoin ETFs brought in $8 billion across a dozen funds. Institutions seem more interested in returns and yield than Ethereum’s security pitch. Ethereum’s roadmap hasn’t been convincing enough to pull serious capital out of Bitcoin’s orbit. At the same time, Michael Saylor’s firm MicroStrategy is going all-in on Bitcoin again. His company just announced it would sell $2.1 billion worth of 10% “perpetual strife” preferred stock to buy more Bitcoin. That kind of headline doesn’t help Ethereum’s case. When one chain is pulling in billions through aggressive buying strategies, and the other is launching rebrands to chase institutional money that isn’t even arriving, the contrast is sharp.

2025-05-22T22:30:49.000Z,"US Crypto Regulation: Crucial House Crypto Bill Markup Set for June 10","BitcoinWorld US Crypto Regulation: Crucial House Crypto Bill Markup Set for June 10 The wheels of legislative progress continue to turn in Washington D.C. for the digital asset space. A significant date has been set for those closely watching the development of US crypto regulation: June 10. This is when the U.S. House of Representatives is scheduled to hold a markup session for its proposed House crypto bill, aimed at establishing a clear regulatory framework for the industry. This news, shared by Crypto in America host Eleanor Terrett on X, marks a tangible step forward in the ongoing effort to define cryptocurrency law in the United States and shape the future crypto market structure. What is the House Crypto Bill and Why Does it Matter for US Crypto Regulation? The proposed House crypto bill, often referred to as a market structure bill, is a bipartisan effort primarily driven by members of the House Financial Services Committee and potentially the House Agriculture Committee, given the dual nature of some digital assets being seen as both securities and commodities. Its main goal is to provide regulatory clarity for the digital asset ecosystem in the U.S. Currently, the lack of a unified federal approach means different agencies, notably the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), assert jurisdiction over various aspects of the crypto market. This has led to uncertainty, conflicting guidance, and a perception within the industry that the U.S. is lagging behind other jurisdictions in establishing predictable US crypto regulation. The House crypto bill aims to address this by: Defining which digital assets fall under which regulatory body’s purview. Establishing rules for crypto exchanges, brokers, and other intermediaries. Setting standards for consumer protection and market integrity. Providing a framework for stablecoins. Passing this bill would be a significant development, potentially unlocking greater institutional investment, fostering innovation domestically, and providing much-needed legal certainty for businesses operating in the space. It represents a concerted effort by lawmakers to move beyond enforcement actions towards proactive cryptocurrency lawmaking. Understanding the Crypto Bill Markup Process: What Happens on June 10? Setting a date for a crypto bill markup is a crucial procedural step in the legislative journey. A markup session is when a congressional committee reviews, debates, and amends a proposed bill. It’s a detailed, often lengthy process where committee members offer amendments to the bill’s text. Here’s what typically happens during a markup: Introduction: The committee chair formally introduces the bill. Discussion: Committee members discuss the bill’s provisions, potential impacts, and areas of concern. Amendments: Members propose amendments to change the bill. These amendments are debated and voted upon by the committee. Vote: After all amendments are considered, the committee votes on the final version of the bill. If it passes the committee vote, it is then sent to the full House floor for further consideration and debate. The crypto bill markup on June 10 is the opportunity for the House Financial Services Committee (and potentially others involved) to refine the House crypto bill based on feedback, negotiations, and differing perspectives within the committee. The outcome of this session will determine the exact text of the bill that could potentially move forward for a full House vote. The Long Road to US Crypto Regulation: Context and Challenges The path to comprehensive US crypto regulation has been challenging and slow. Multiple factors contribute to this difficulty: Novelty and Complexity: Digital assets are a rapidly evolving technology that doesn’t fit neatly into existing financial regulations designed for traditional assets. Jurisdictional Disputes: As mentioned, the SEC and CFTC have differing views on how digital assets should be classified and regulated. Political Polarization: While there is some bipartisan support for creating a framework, disagreements exist on the specifics, particularly regarding the balance between innovation, consumer protection, and financial stability. Lobbying and Industry Input: The crypto industry, consumer groups, and traditional finance firms all lobby lawmakers, presenting diverse and sometimes conflicting viewpoints. Previous attempts at establishing clear cryptocurrency law have stalled or failed to gain sufficient traction. This makes the scheduled crypto bill markup a notable moment, indicating a renewed push to move legislation forward in the current congressional term. Potential Impact on the Crypto Market Structure The eventual passage of a House crypto bill could profoundly impact the crypto market structure in the United States. A clear legal and regulatory framework could: Increase Institutional Adoption: Large financial institutions are often hesitant to engage deeply with crypto due to regulatory uncertainty. Clear rules could provide the confidence needed for broader participation. Enhance Consumer Protection: The bill is expected to include provisions aimed at protecting retail investors from fraud and manipulation, potentially increasing trust in regulated platforms. Foster Domestic Innovation: With clear rules, crypto startups might be more inclined to build and operate in the U.S. rather than seeking friendlier jurisdictions abroad. Define Asset Classes: A key outcome could be a clearer legal definition of when a digital asset is a security (regulated by the SEC) versus a commodity (regulated by the CFTC). However, challenges remain. Critics worry that poorly designed US crypto regulation could stifle innovation through overly burdensome compliance requirements or definitions that don’t accurately reflect the technology. The specifics hammered out during the crypto bill markup and subsequent legislative steps will be critical in determining whether the bill achieves its intended positive outcomes for the crypto market structure. Stakeholders and Perspectives on Cryptocurrency Law Various groups have vested interests and differing views on the development of cryptocurrency law: Crypto Industry: Generally advocates for clear, tailored rules that recognize the unique nature of digital assets, often preferring CFTC oversight for many tokens. They seek a framework that encourages innovation and provides a level playing field. Traditional Finance: Some institutions see crypto as a new asset class and want clear rules to participate, while others may view it as a threat or competitor and support stricter regulations. Regulators (SEC/CFTC): The SEC has largely favored regulating many tokens as securities under existing law, while the CFTC has viewed Bitcoin and Ethereum as commodities. The bill aims to provide legislative direction to resolve some of these turf wars. Consumer Advocates: Focus on protecting investors from scams, fraud, and market manipulation, generally supporting robust oversight and disclosure requirements. Lawmakers: Republicans have generally pushed for legislation providing clarity and limiting what they see as regulation by enforcement, while Democrats have often emphasized strong consumer protection and addressing potential systemic risks. The crypto bill markup is where these differing perspectives within the committee will clash and compromise, attempting to forge a version of the House crypto bill that can garner enough support to move forward. Actionable Insights: How to Stay Informed For anyone involved in or interested in the crypto space, staying informed about the progress of the House crypto bill and broader US crypto regulation is essential. Here are some steps you can take: Follow Reputable News Sources: Keep an eye on financial news outlets, crypto-specific news sites, and reports from organizations tracking legislative developments. Monitor Committee Activities: The House Financial Services Committee website is a primary source for information on hearing schedules, bill text, and markup outcomes. Understand the Bill’s Details: As the bill progresses, read summaries or the text itself to understand its potential impact on specific assets or activities you’re interested in. Engage with Your Representatives: Contacting your members of Congress to share your views on the importance of clear, effective cryptocurrency law can be impactful. The June 10 crypto bill markup is just one step, but a significant one, in a potentially long legislative process that includes votes in the full House, consideration in the Senate, and potentially conference committees to reconcile differences between House and Senate versions before a bill can become law. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for US Crypto Regulation The scheduling of the crypto bill markup for June 10 is a tangible indicator that U.S. lawmakers are actively working towards establishing a comprehensive framework for US crypto regulation. This session represents a critical juncture where the details of the proposed House crypto bill will be debated, amended, and potentially advanced. While the path to final cryptocurrency law is still long and uncertain, this markup is a necessary step in providing the clarity and structure needed for the future growth and stability of the crypto market structure in the United States. All eyes will be on the committee on June 10 to see how this pivotal session unfolds.

2025-05-22T22:10:30.000Z,"Crypto Whale Scores Massive $23.7M ETH Profit While Holding Bitcoin Fortune","BitcoinWorld Crypto Whale Scores Massive $23.7M ETH Profit While Holding Bitcoin Fortune The world of cryptocurrency is often moved by the actions of its largest players – the so-called ‘whales.’ These are individuals or entities holding vast amounts of digital assets, and their trades can send ripples across the market. Recently, one such crypto whale executed a remarkable maneuver, netting tens of millions in profit from Ethereum while maintaining a substantial position in Bitcoin. Who is This Mysterious Crypto Whale and What Did They Buy? Tracking the movements of a large crypto investor can offer valuable insights into market sentiment and potential trends. According to on-chain data shared by Lookonchain on X, a specific whale made a significant move on April 27th. This investor acquired a massive portfolio via over-the-counter (OTC) transactions, ensuring minimal market disruption during the purchase. The acquisition included: 30,000 ETH: Purchased for $54.9 million, averaging out to a price of $1,830 per ETH. 600 BTC: Acquired for $56.94 million, at an average price of $94,900 per BTC. This initial outlay demonstrates the sheer scale of capital deployed by this crypto whale , signaling strong conviction in both Ethereum and Bitcoin at the time of purchase. Cashing In: The Impressive ETH Profit While holding both assets for a period, the whale recently decided to take profits on their Ethereum position. This isn’t just any profit; it’s a staggering gain that highlights the potential returns in volatile crypto markets when timed effectively. The investor sold their entire holding of 30,000 ETH for a total of $78.63 million. Let’s break down the impressive ETH profit : Transaction Amount Price per Unit Total Value Purchase (ETH) 30,000 ETH $1,830 $54.9 million Sale (ETH) 30,000 ETH $2,621 $78.63 million Realized Profit – – $23.73 million This realized gain of $23.73 million represents a return of approximately 43% on the initial ETH investment in a relatively short timeframe. It’s a prime example of a successful crypto trading execution by a large player. The Unsold Bitcoin Holdings: Awaiting Further Gains? Interestingly, despite realizing significant gains on Ethereum, the whale has opted to hold onto their Bitcoin position. The 600 BTC acquired alongside the ETH remain in the investor’s wallet. As of the latest report from Lookonchain, these Bitcoin holdings are currently valued at $66.5 million. Comparing this to the initial purchase price of $56.94 million, the whale is sitting on a substantial unrealized gain of $9.6 million from their BTC position alone. This decision to sell ETH but hold BTC suggests a potentially different outlook or strategy for the two leading cryptocurrencies. Analyzing the Crypto Trading Strategy What can we infer from this crypto trading pattern? Selling ETH while holding BTC could indicate several things: Profit Taking & Risk Management: The whale might have viewed the ETH rally as a good opportunity to lock in substantial profits, perhaps de-risking their overall portfolio while maintaining exposure to Bitcoin, which they might believe has further upside potential. Different Time Horizons: The investor might have had a shorter-term target for ETH and a longer-term view for BTC. Market Signal: While not definitive, such large-scale selling of one asset and holding of another by a significant player is often watched closely by the market for potential signals. This case study provides a fascinating glimpse into the high-stakes world of a large crypto investor navigating the market. What Can We Learn from This Large Crypto Investor? While most individual traders don’t operate on this scale, the actions of a large crypto investor like this whale offer valuable lessons: The Importance of Strategy: This wasn’t a random trade; it involved a large OTC purchase and a strategic sale. Having a plan is crucial. Profit Realization: Knowing when to take profits is just as important as knowing when to buy. The whale didn’t wait for the absolute peak (if there was one yet) but locked in a significant gain. Portfolio Allocation: The decision to hold one asset while selling another highlights how investors view different cryptocurrencies within their portfolio. Tracking Whales: While not always predictive, monitoring the moves of significant wallets can provide context for market movements. This event underscores the dynamic nature of the crypto market and the potential for substantial returns, as demonstrated by this whale’s impressive ETH profit . Conclusion The recent activity of this prominent crypto whale serves as a compelling narrative in the ongoing saga of digital asset markets. By strategically acquiring and then partially liquidating positions, this large crypto investor secured a remarkable $23.73 million ETH profit . Their continued holding of substantial Bitcoin holdings , currently sitting on significant unrealized gains, suggests a calculated approach to their portfolio, employing distinct strategies for different assets. This instance of high-stakes crypto trading offers valuable insights into how major players navigate volatility and capitalize on market movements, reminding us of the exciting opportunities present in the cryptocurrency space.

Not only did the labs rarely provide COVID-19 test kits to beneficiaries, but the defendants allegedly went so far as to pay a marketing company to acquire the names of hundreds of thousands of Medicare beneficiaries to be used in the fraud. Said Matthew R. Galeotti, Head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, of the purported scheme: “As alleged, the defendants used straw owners at multiple laboratories to cause the submission of more than $200 million in fraudulent claims to Medicare for COVID-19 test kits. Healthcare fraud harms Americans by squandering taxpayer money and diverting limited resources from those who need them most. The Criminal Division will continue to aggressively prosecute these crimes to hold fraudsters accountable, protect victims, and recover financial losses.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-05-22T22:00:48.000Z,"Bitcoin Tops $111K — Yet MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP Are Capturing the Market’s Imagination With Superior Upside","As the cryptocurrency market surges into mid-2025, Bitcoin’s historic climb above $111,000 has grabbed global attention. Yet, beneath the surface of this milestone, a dynamic shift is underway. Investors are increasingly drawn to select altcoins that promise not just stability, but transformative returns. Meanwhile, Ethereum and Avalanche remain solid performers, but it’s the early-stage and narrative-driven assets that are commanding the spotlight. Among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a standout, drawing attention for its early-stage momentum and potential for outsized returns—making it a top contender for those seeking the next big crypto success story 5000% ROI STILL ON THE TABLE – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Phenomenon Poised for Explosive Growth MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly establishing itself as the premier presale opportunity of 2025. With over $8 million raised and a listing target of $0.007, the project is drawing both retail and institutional interest ahead of its exchange debut. Analysts are projecting returns of 25x–35x from current entry points, with some models pointing to even greater upside if demand remains robust. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Stands Out: Scarcity-Driven Model: Capped supply and audited contracts ensure transparency and value preservation. Narrative Strength: A politically charged brand and loyal community are driving organic growth and media traction. Early-Stage Momentum: With Stage 8 nearing completion, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers one of the last ground-floor entry points before public price discovery. Strategic Positioning: The project’s roadmap and token utility are resonating with investors seeking asymmetric returns. MAGACOIN FINANCE is a strategic early-stage play that could rival the early days of SHIBA INU and DOGE, but with a more transparent and structured approach. Bitcoin: Institutional Surge and Record Highs Bitcoin’s latest ascent is powered by unprecedented institutional inflows, with U.S. spot ETFs attracting billions in fresh capital and major financial institutions expanding their crypto exposure. Analysts forecast that BTC could climb to $116,000–$137,000 in the near term, with long-term models suggesting even higher ceilings if current momentum persists. Yet, as Bitcoin’s rally stabilizes, a growing share of capital is rotating toward altcoins with higher-multiple potential—and MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its presale structure and community-driven growth, is perfectly positioned to capture this wave of interest XRP: Institutional Validation and Price Projections XRP has surged from $1.75 in April to its current range of $2.40–$2.65, buoyed by regulatory clarity and anticipation of new institutional products. Analysts now see a clear path toward $5–$10, with some bullish scenarios targeting $15 or higher if ETF approvals and global adoption accelerate. XRP’s combination of real-world utility and institutional backing makes it a top pick for those seeking both stability and significant upside. While XRP remains a core institutional asset, its upside is increasingly being matched by the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE, which continues to attract early adopters looking for the next crypto breakout Ethereum: Steady Growth Amid Market Rotation Ethereum trades between $2,550–$2,600 and remains the backbone of decentralized finance and Web3, with ongoing upgrades and institutional adoption supporting its price. However, after a robust rally, ETH’s momentum has moderated, and some investors are shifting toward early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper returns. With its transparent tokenomics and rapid presale progress, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a compelling alternative for those seeking the next wave of crypto innovation. Avalanche: Institutional Interest and Technical Strength Avalanche is seeing steady adoption and trades averagely at $22, with notable integrations from major institutions and a growing presence in DeFi and gaming. While AVAX is a dependable hold, its near-term upside is less dramatic compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. The latter’s aggressive community-led growth and record-setting capital inflows make it the clear choice for investors targeting high-multiple opportunities before listings Solana: Layer-1 Leader, but Momentum Shifts Trading at $170–$175, solana continues to lead among Layer-1 platforms, with strong DeFi usage and developer activity. After a period of rapid appreciation, SOL’s price growth has moderated, prompting some investors to seek higher-multiple opportunities elsewhere. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its structured presale and clear path to exchange listings, offers a unique chance to participate in a project poised for explosive expansion as the cycle progresses CLICK HERE – $0.007 LISTING COMING FAST Final Thoughts Bitcoin’s record-breaking rally is a landmark event, but the most compelling opportunities may lie elsewhere. MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP are capturing the market’s imagination with their unique value propositions and potential for outsized gains. With MAGACOIN’s presale nearing completion and XRP’s institutional momentum building, these assets are poised to lead the next wave of crypto market growth. For investors seeking transformative returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the breakout opportunity of 2025.

2025-05-22T22:00:26.000Z,"Here’s what happened in crypto today","Today in crypto, US lawmakers are drafting an amendment to the GENIUS Act to bar sitting presidents from profiting off stablecoins. Sui-based decentralized exchange Cetus has been exploited, losing more than $200 million. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has broken past the $110,000 mark for the first time. Senators plan to amend GENIUS Act to address Trump family's stablecoin Though a majority of members of the US Senate voted to advance a bill to regulate payment stablecoins on May 20, high-ranking Democrats are planning to propose an amendment to the legislation to address President Donald Trump’s connections to the cryptocurrency industry. According to a May 22 Axios report, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senators Elizabeth Warren and Jeff Merkley will file an amendment to the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act, or GENIUS Act, to block a US president from profiting from stablecoins. The proposed amendment would come after 18 Democrats sided with Republicans in the Senate in voting to advance the bill on May 20 after it failed a procedural vote on May 8. “Passing the GENIUS Act without our anti-corruption amendment stamps a Congressional seal of approval on Trump selling access and influence to the highest bidder,” Merkley said in a May 22 X post. Trump his three sons are involved in the crypto platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI), which launched its USD1 stablecoin in March. Critics have pointed out that the president could continue to personally benefit from legislation that helps recognize stablecoins like USD1 as financial instruments in the US. Sui DEX Cetus hit by suspected hack: Over $200 million in potential losses Cetus, a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Sui blockchain, is suspected to have been hit by a massive exploit that may have drained more than $200 million worth of digital assets. Pseudonymous Web3 researcher COMDARE3 posted on X that “users report” that Sui-based DEX Cetus is being exploited.” They also shared a screenshot of Cetus market data on DEX Screener , showing many assets losing well over half of their value over the last 24 hours. The team behind Extractor, an onchain monitoring tool developed by crypto cybersecurity company Hacken, confirmed that “at least $63m was already bridged to Ethereum, 20k ETH was just transferred to a fresh wallet” in a single transaction . A Hacken representative told Cointelegraph that these findings were confirmed by the company’s Web3 researcher, Yehor Rudytsia. Cetus pool data shows that as of the time of writing, the DEX processed $2.9 billion worth of transactions on May 22, a significant increase over the $320 million reported on May 21. This heightened level of activity may have been caused by funds being siphoned out of the protocol. Cetus did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comments about the suspected exploit. A Sui team representative gave no comment to Cointelegraph regarding the Cetus situation. Some tokens, such as Lombard Staked BTC (LBTC) or AXOLcoin (AXOL) lost most of their value on Cetus. The top 15 losers all lost in excess of three-quarters of their price. Cetus DEX-listed asset pricing data. Source: DEX Screener Bitcoin climbs above $110,000 for the first time Bitcoin ( BTC ) rallied above $110,000 for the first time late on May 21 after it gained over 3% in the past day and continued its rally early into May 22 to a high of nearly $112,000 as of 4 am UTC. The cryptocurrency had well passed a a peak high of $109,458 that it hit earlier in the day, which was the first time it traded above its long-held Jan. 20 peak. Bitcoin has gained around 20% this year and has nearly doubled since its slump to $75,000 on April 7, triggered by US President Donald Trump enacting sweeping tariffs that tanked global markets. Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows it has climbed out of a slump earlier this year.

WLD price is over 86 percent down from its all-time high but rising institutional adoption signals a momentum shift. Worldcoin (WLD) price dominated the top altcoin gainers in the past 24 hours after Bitcoin (BTC) price confirmed the onset of a crypto summer 2025. The mid-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $15.9 billion and a 24-hour average traded volume of around $1 billion, surged over 30 percent on Thursday to trade about $1.59 during the late North American trading session. Following the WLD price rally today, the total Worldcoin futures open interest surged over 67 percent in the past 24 hours to hover about $411 million at the time of this writing.

Following the notable Worldcoin adoption, the World Foundation announced a $135 million raised funds from a16z and Bain Capital Crypto. Most importantly, the investors purchased WLD tokens directly from the secondary market. Short-Term Targets for WLD Price As with the wider altcoin market, the WLD price has recorded bullish momentum since the first week of April 2025, following the easing of the trade war. In the four-hour time frame, the WLD price has been forming higher highs and higher lows, a characteristic of a rising trend. Following the recent rebound from the established rising logarithmic trend, WLD price is now aiming for the next target range between $2.32 and $4.124. Furthermore, the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) surged above the 70 percent level again, signaling bullish sentiment. Additionally, the daily MACD line has already crossed the zero line amid growing histograms.

2025-05-22T21:48:15.000Z,"Tom Emmer Reintroduces Regulatory Clarity For Crypto Tech Bill","On May 21, Congressman Tom Emmer reintroduced the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act (BRCA), a bipartisan bill co-led with Congressman Ritchie Torres. The bill’s core principle stipulates that if crypto developers and service providers do not hold custody of consumer funds, they shouldn’t be classified as money transmitters under current regulations. The clarification aims to provide legal certainty for blockchain developers, miners, validators, and crypto wallet providers who build non-custodial services. Clarity for Developers, Miners, and Validators The legislation addresses concerns that unclear regulations are pushing American crypto innovation overseas. Both congressmen emphasize that the bill protects innovation while maintaining appropriate oversight, and they have refined the framework based on previous feedback when similar language was rejected in committee. “The longer we delay this commonsense clarification, the greater the risk that this transformative technology is pushed overseas, harming American investors and innovators,” said Emmer . “If we want to keep the next generation of builders in the United States, this kind of legal clarity is essential,” said Torres, who added, “We cannot afford to let outdated or misapplied regulations drive American talent and technology overseas.” Several industry organizations have endorsed the reintroduction, including Coin Center, DeFi Education Fund, Blockchain Association, Solana Policy Institute, and Crypto Council for Innovation. Emmer originally introduced this bill in 2018, and the current version represents continued efforts to establish regulatory clarity. Texas Bitcoin Reserve Bill Passes In related news, the Texas strategic Bitcoin reserve bill ( SB 21 ) has passed the third reading by a vote of 101 to 42 and now heads to the Governor’s desk for signature. The bill establishes the reserve as an investment vehicle, allowing the state to actively buy, sell, and manage high market cap crypto assets for financial security and economic resilience.

According to a report from My London, Jacob Irwin-Cline went out to a London bar and had several drinks before calling an Uber to take him home. Cline said that he did not thoroughly check the details of the Uber ride on his phone and left with a random private cab driver resembling the Uber driver at first glance, but driving a different vehicle — a detail Cline would only discover after the incident. Once inside the vehicle, the US tourist said the driver offered him a cigarette, which Cline said was likely laced with a rare and potent sedative drug called scopolamine. Cline added that the cigarette made him feel extremely docile and tired, causing him to pass out for around 30 minutes before regaining consciousness. Shortly after Cline woke up, the driver ordered him out of the vehicle. As Cline exited, the driver suddenly sped off, striking him with the car and fleeing with his cellphone, which contained his private keys and access to his crypto accounts. The unfortunate incident comes amid a recent spate of kidnappings , extortion incidents, armed robberies, and ransom attempts directed at crypto industry executives, investors, and their families. Related: Chainalysis CEO offers a clue into recent spate of Paris crypto attacks Crypto community members become the targets of violent crime Several kidnapping incidents involving crypto investors, industry executives, and their families have occurred in May. On May 3, the father of an unnamed crypto exchange owner was freed by French police after law enforcement officials raided the property where the individual was being held captive by organized criminals demanding a ransom for his release. Shortly after that incident, the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, the CEO of the Paymium crypto exchange, were the targets of an attempted kidnapping in Paris. The incident occurred in broad daylight when the assailants attacked the family and attempted to force them into a parked vehicle. However, Noizat's daughter and another individual were able to fight off the masked attackers.

2025-05-22T21:38:43.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: New ATH Confirmed — Here’s Where BTC Could Be Headed Next","Bitcoin (BTC) has hit a new all time high of $111,087, up 3% in a day and finally breaking above the long held resistance zone of $108,000. The daily close above the highs is a big deal for the crypto markets. BTC is now in a rising channel since April, with higher highs and higher lows. Technically the breakout is strong. MACD has just given a bullish crossover and the 50 day EMA ($96,956) is rising, the long term trend is strong. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview If BTC holds above $113,369, we may see the next resistance levels at $117,141 and $120,913. But price is at the top of the channel so a pullback to $108,000 could be a healthy reset and a second chance long. Regulation Boosts Investor Confidence Beyond the charts, Bitcoin’s breakout is being driven by big regulatory tailwinds. In Texas, the state lawmakers approved Senate Bill 21 , allowing the state to create a Bitcoin reserve. Once signed into law, Texas will be the second US state after New Hampshire to hold crypto on its balance sheet, a big step in legitimizing Bitcoin as a treasury asset. JUST IN: The Texas House has officially passed the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bill (SB21). Using rainy day funds, Texas could purchase 217,654 BTC assuming a BTC price of $109,219. BULLISH! pic.twitter.com/04WBx4gr8d — Satoshi Club (@esatoshiclub) May 21, 2025 Hong Kong also passed landmark legislation to regulate fiat-referenced stablecoins (FRS), including licensing, AML compliance and reserve management. This tighter framework will attract institutional capital and solidify Bitcoin as a regulated and strategic hedge in global finance. These policy changes reduce uncertainty and mean crypto is becoming part of the mainstream financial infrastructure – key for long term adoption and capital inflow. Macro Tailwinds Fuel Bullish Outlook for Bitcoin Bitcoin’s rally comes as traditional markets are getting nervous. A disappointing US Treasury auction pushed 20 year bond yields above 5.1%, 10 year and 30 year yields are also spiking. This bond market chaos is driving investors to Bitcoin as a macro hedge. Geopolitical tensions – tariffs and currency concerns – are also eroding faith in fiat systems. $110K BITCOIN HAS ENTERED THE CHAT Bitcoin just cracked six figures guess it finally remembered the password.

2025-05-22T21:30:33.000Z,"Dogecoin Breaks Out Of Bull Pennant—What’s The Target?","An analyst has pointed out how Dogecoin is showing a break out of a Bull Pennant. Here’s where the target could lie, based on the pattern. Dogecoin Has Just Seen A Surge Beyond Bull Pennant Resistance In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a pattern that has been forming in the hourly price of Dogecoin recently. The pattern in question is a “Bull Pennant,” which is a type of Pennant from technical analysis (TA). A Pennant forms whenever the price of an asset witnesses consolidation between two converging trendlines following a sharp move. The initial rapid move is known as the ‘pole,’ and the consolidation channel as the ‘pennant.’ Related Reading: Bitcoin Sets New ATH, But This Metric Says No Overheating Yet This arrangement is similar to that seen in Flag patterns, with the main difference between the two being the fact that Flags involve parallel consolidation channels, not triangular ones. Just like other consolidation patterns in TA, when the price is stuck inside the pennant portion, it is likely to face resistance at the upper level and support at the lower one. Pennants are usually considered continuation patterns, so a breakout is more probable to occur in the same direction as the preceding move (that is, the same orientation as the pole). When the pole is pointing in the up direction, the resulting Pennant is called a Bull Pennant. Similarly, it being in the opposite direction forms what’s known as a Bear Pennant. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the Bull Pennant that the 1-hour Dogecoin price has potentially been trading inside recently: As is visible in the above graph, Dogecoin was witnessing net consolidation toward the downside inside this Bull Pennant earlier, but now, with the latest rally in the asset, its price has managed to find a break above the resistance line. So far, the memecoin hasn’t gained too much distance over the line, so it’s unconfirmed whether this is a real breakout. In the scenario that it is indeed the case and the governing pattern here is a Bull Pennant, then it’s possible that DOGE could end up seeing a rally of a similar scale as the pole of the pattern. The length of the pole involved in this Bull Pennant puts the breakout target at around $0.31. If the memecoin can manage a run to this mark, then its price would have gone up by almost 30% from the current level. Related Reading: $3.8 Billion In Capital Inflows Behind Ethereum’s Post-Pectra Surge, Data Shows It now remains to be seen how Dogecoin would develop in the coming days and whether its path would look anything like the one traced by the pattern.

2025-05-22T21:20:01.000Z,"SecureTech Unveils Ambitious Bitcoin Treasury Strategy and Web3 M&A Push","BitcoinWorld SecureTech Unveils Ambitious Bitcoin Treasury Strategy and Web3 M&A Push In the rapidly evolving intersection of cybersecurity, Web3, and corporate finance, SecureTech is making significant waves. The company has laid out an ambitious roadmap for 2025, signaling a clear intent to strengthen its market position and embrace innovative financial strategies. At the heart of these plans are a strategic share reduction, targeted mergers and acquisitions (M&A) to bolster technology offerings, preparations for a potential stock uplisting to a national exchange, and critically, the development of a pioneering Bitcoin treasury strategy . Understanding SecureTech’s Bold 2025 Vision SecureTech, known for its work in cybersecurity and the burgeoning Web3 space, isn’t just planning incremental changes; they’re outlining a transformative year. The 2025 strategy appears designed to enhance shareholder value, expand technological capabilities, increase market visibility, and integrate digital assets into core corporate finance. Key pillars of their announced plans include: A substantial 55% reduction in outstanding shares. Active pursuit of Web3 M&A opportunities. Steps towards potentially uplisting to a national stock exchange. Implementing a dedicated Bitcoin treasury strategy via subsidiaries and partnerships. Ongoing evaluation of opportunities within the broader blockchain fintech landscape. This multi-faceted approach suggests a company positioning itself for significant growth and adaptation in a dynamic digital economy. Why a 55% Share Reduction? A significant share reduction, like the 55% planned by SecureTech, is a powerful corporate finance move. It typically involves buying back shares from the open market or through tender offers. The primary goal is often to increase the value of the remaining outstanding shares. Here’s how it generally works and potential benefits: Increased Earnings Per Share (EPS): With fewer shares outstanding, the company’s net income is divided among a smaller number of shares, potentially boosting EPS. This can make the stock look more attractive to investors. Improved Valuation Metrics: Other per-share metrics, like book value per share, can also improve. Signaling Confidence: A share buyback can signal that the company believes its stock is undervalued and that investing in its own shares is a good use of capital. Returning Value to Shareholders: It’s a way to return capital to shareholders, similar to dividends, but potentially more tax-efficient in some jurisdictions. Consolidation of Ownership: In some cases, it can consolidate ownership, giving existing shareholders a larger percentage of the company. For SecureTech, this move could be aimed at enhancing its financial profile ahead of potential M&A activities or a stock uplisting, making the company appear financially stronger and more efficient. How Does Web3 M&A Fit In? SecureTech’s focus on Web3 M&A highlights the company’s commitment to expanding its technological footprint in next-generation internet technologies. Web3 encompasses decentralized technologies like blockchain, NFTs, decentralized finance (DeFi), and the metaverse. Mergers and acquisitions in this space can allow SecureTech to: Acquire Talent and Expertise: Bring in skilled teams with specialized knowledge in specific Web3 niches. Gain Access to New Technology: Integrate innovative blockchain protocols, smart contract capabilities, or decentralized application (dApp) platforms. Expand Product Offerings: Add new services or products related to digital asset security, decentralized identity, or Web3 infrastructure. Enter New Markets: Establish a presence in specific Web3 verticals or geographic regions. Accelerate Growth: Achieve faster expansion than would be possible through internal development alone. The strategic nature of this M&A drive suggests SecureTech is looking for synergistic opportunities that complement its existing cybersecurity and Web3 foundations, creating a more robust and diversified technology portfolio. Preparing for a Stock Uplisting: What Does it Mean? Moving from an over-the-counter (OTC) market to a national exchange, such as the Nasdaq or New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), is known as a stock uplisting . This is a significant step for any company and comes with increased scrutiny and requirements. The process typically involves: Meeting stringent financial standards (revenue, net income, market capitalization). Adhering to higher corporate governance requirements. Ensuring a minimum share price and public float. Increased reporting and compliance obligations. The benefits of a successful stock uplisting are substantial: Increased Visibility and Prestige: Listing on a major exchange brings more attention from institutional investors and analysts. Improved Liquidity: Trading volume often increases, making it easier for investors to buy and sell shares. Enhanced Access to Capital: Being on a national exchange can make it easier and cheaper to raise funds through future stock offerings. Broader Investor Base: Attracts a wider range of investors, including large institutions that may have restrictions on investing in OTC stocks. SecureTech’s preparation for this move indicates confidence in its growth trajectory and a desire to access larger capital markets and gain greater legitimacy in the eyes of mainstream finance. Deep Dive: SecureTech’s Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Perhaps one of the most intriguing aspects of SecureTech’s 2025 plan is the development of a dedicated Bitcoin treasury strategy . This involves holding Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset, a practice popularized by companies like MicroStrategy. SecureTech is pursuing this through its subsidiary, Piranha Blockchain, and a partnership with LockerFunder. This structure suggests a multi-pronged approach: Piranha Blockchain’s Role: Likely focuses on the technical and operational aspects of acquiring, securing, and managing the Bitcoin holdings. This could involve developing or utilizing secure custody solutions. LockerFunder Partnership: Could be related to financing mechanisms for acquiring Bitcoin, leveraging existing capital, or potentially providing services related to the strategy’s execution. Strategic Rationale: Companies adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy for various reasons, including a hedge against inflation, a belief in Bitcoin’s long-term appreciation potential, and diversification away from traditional fiat holdings. For a Web3 and fintech-focused company like SecureTech, it also aligns with their core business and expertise in digital assets. Implementing such a strategy involves careful consideration of security, regulatory compliance, accounting treatment, and market volatility. It signals a forward-thinking approach to corporate finance, embracing digital assets as part of a modern treasury management system. Evaluating Further Blockchain Fintech Opportunities Beyond the specific focus on a Bitcoin treasury and Web3 M&A, SecureTech is also broadly evaluating further opportunities in the blockchain fintech space. This indicates a commitment to staying at the forefront of financial technology innovation. What might this evaluation entail? Exploring DeFi Applications: Investigating decentralized finance protocols for potential integration or services. Looking into Tokenization: Examining the potential for tokenizing real-world assets or creating new digital assets. Assessing Payment Solutions: Evaluating blockchain-based payment systems and infrastructure. Identifying Strategic Partnerships: Seeking collaborations with other players in the blockchain and fintech ecosystems. Developing New Products: Creating innovative solutions that leverage blockchain technology for financial use cases, potentially related to security, identity, or asset management. This broad evaluation shows SecureTech’s intent to not only participate in the current digital asset landscape but also to actively shape its future through exploring and potentially integrating emerging blockchain fintech advancements. Benefits and Challenges of SecureTech’s Strategy SecureTech’s comprehensive 2025 plan presents a mix of potential benefits and inherent challenges. Potential Benefits: Enhanced Shareholder Value: Share reduction and potential uplisting can boost stock attractiveness. Technological Leadership: Web3 M&A can integrate cutting-edge tech and talent. Increased Capital Access: Uplisting opens doors to larger funding opportunities. Innovative Finance: Bitcoin treasury strategy aligns with digital asset trends and potential long-term gains. Market Position: Aggressive strategy can solidify SecureTech’s place in the cybersecurity and Web3 sectors. Potential Challenges: Execution Risk: Successfully implementing a share reduction, complex M&A, and an uplisting simultaneously is challenging. Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price volatility introduces risk to the treasury strategy. Regulatory Uncertainty: The Web3 and crypto space faces evolving regulations. Integration Hurdles: Merging acquired companies and technologies can be difficult. Cost and Resources: These initiatives require significant financial and human resources. Navigating these challenges effectively will be key to realizing the full potential of SecureTech’s ambitious plans. What Actionable Insights Can We Take? For investors and market watchers, SecureTech’s strategy offers several points of interest: Monitor Execution: Keep a close eye on how SecureTech progresses with its share reduction, M&A deals, and uplisting efforts. Milestones achieved or missed will be telling. Evaluate Bitcoin Treasury Performance: Track the performance and management of their Bitcoin treasury strategy . This will be a key differentiator and potential value driver, but also a source of risk. Assess M&A Targets: If specific acquisition targets are announced, evaluate how they complement SecureTech’s existing business and contribute to their Web3 M&A goals. Observe Uplisting Progress: Follow their steps towards a national exchange listing, including meeting necessary requirements. Watch for Blockchain Fintech Innovation: Pay attention to any new products or partnerships emerging from their evaluation of blockchain fintech opportunities. SecureTech’s strategy provides a case study in how established tech companies are seeking to integrate digital assets and decentralized technologies into their core operations and financial planning. Conclusion: A Future Built on Digital Assets and Strategic Growth SecureTech’s 2025 strategy paints a picture of a company aggressively pursuing growth and innovation at the frontier of technology and finance. From reducing its share count to preparing for a significant stock uplisting , the company is taking concrete steps to enhance its corporate structure and market standing. Their proactive pursuit of Web3 M&A opportunities signals a clear intent to expand technological capabilities in decentralized domains. However, the most noteworthy element is arguably the formal adoption of a Bitcoin treasury strategy , positioning SecureTech among a growing list of companies integrating digital assets into their balance sheets. Coupled with an ongoing evaluation of broader blockchain fintech possibilities, SecureTech is clearly charting a course deeply intertwined with the future of digital finance and decentralized technology. Success will depend on skillful execution and navigating the inherent volatilities and regulatory complexities of the digital asset space.

2025-05-22T21:10:04.000Z,"Roxom Global Funding: Powering a New Bitcoin Exchange and Crypto Media Empire","BitcoinWorld Roxom Global Funding: Powering a New Bitcoin Exchange and Crypto Media Empire Exciting news is rippling through the cryptocurrency world! Roxom Global, a project with a clear focus on Bitcoin, has successfully closed a significant funding round. This development signals strong investor confidence not just in Roxom Global’s vision, but also in the continued potential of the Bitcoin ecosystem and broader crypto investment landscape. Understanding the Roxom Global Funding Breakdown The recent capital raise by Roxom Global is quite substantial, totaling an impressive $17.9 million. What’s particularly interesting is how this funding is allocated, highlighting the company’s dual-pronged strategy: $7.9 million: Earmarked specifically for the development and launch of their BTC-denominated securities exchange. This is a key piece of their infrastructure, focusing on transactions settled directly in Bitcoin. $10 million: Dedicated to building out RoxomTV, their ambitious 24/7 crypto media network . This indicates a strong belief in the need for dedicated, round-the-clock coverage of the crypto space. This strategic split in the Roxom Global funding underscores the project’s aim to be both a transactional hub and a central information source within the Bitcoin and crypto communities. Why a BTC-Denominated Bitcoin Exchange? The decision to build a Bitcoin exchange where securities are denominated in BTC is a notable one. Most traditional exchanges and even many crypto platforms primarily use fiat currencies (like USD) or stablecoins (like USDT) as the primary trading pair. A BTC-denominated exchange means that the value of assets listed and traded on the platform would be measured directly in Bitcoin. This approach could appeal strongly to Bitcoin maximalists and those who view BTC itself as the primary unit of account and store of value. Potential Benefits: Aligns with Bitcoin Philosophy: Caters directly to users who prefer to operate purely within the Bitcoin standard. Simplifies BTC-Native Strategies: Makes it easier for users to manage and grow their wealth directly in Bitcoin terms. Potential for Innovation: Could pave the way for new types of financial products and services built natively on Bitcoin. Potential Challenges: Niche Market: May initially appeal to a smaller subset of the overall crypto market compared to fiat or stablecoin pairs. Volatility: Trading against a volatile asset like BTC introduces different risk dynamics compared to stable assets. Regulatory Hurdles: Navigating the regulatory landscape for a securities exchange, especially one dealing directly in crypto, can be complex. The Vision for a 24/7 Crypto Media Network With $10 million allocated, RoxomTV aims to be a significant player in the crypto media network space. In a market that never sleeps, having a constant stream of news, analysis, and market data is crucial for investors and enthusiasts alike. A dedicated 24/7 network could offer: Real-time market updates and price analysis. Breaking news coverage from around the globe. In-depth interviews with industry leaders and experts. Educational content for newcomers and advanced traders. Live event coverage and commentary. Building a reputable and widely watched crypto media network requires significant investment in infrastructure, talent, and content creation. Roxom Global’s substantial funding for this arm suggests they are serious about becoming a go-to source for crypto information, aiming to compete with established players and fill potential gaps in round-the-clock coverage. Strategic BTC Treasury Accumulation Beyond building infrastructure, Roxom Global is also focused on strengthening its own balance sheet by accumulating Bitcoin. The report indicates their current BTC treasury holds over $12.5 million worth of Bitcoin at current market prices. Furthermore, they plan to purchase an additional 30 BTC. This strategy of holding Bitcoin on the corporate balance sheet has become increasingly popular among companies, large and small, looking to hedge against inflation or signal their conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value. Holding a significant BTC treasury serves multiple purposes: Store of Value: Positioning Bitcoin as a primary reserve asset. Alignment with Mission: For a Bitcoin-focused company, holding BTC aligns their financial health directly with the asset they promote. Potential Appreciation: Benefiting from potential future increases in Bitcoin’s price. Adding 30 more BTC to a treasury already exceeding $12.5 million demonstrates a strong commitment to this strategy and further ties the company’s future to Bitcoin’s performance. This move is a tangible form of crypto investment by the company itself, distinct from the funding received from external investors. What Does This Funding Round Signal for Crypto Investment? The successful $17.9 million Roxom Global funding round is more than just news about one company; it’s a positive indicator for the broader crypto investment climate. It shows that despite market volatility, investors are still willing to back ambitious projects within the crypto space, particularly those focusing on core infrastructure like exchanges and essential services like media. Key takeaways for those interested in crypto investment : Continued Confidence: Significant capital is still flowing into promising crypto ventures. Focus on Infrastructure: Projects building fundamental layers (exchanges, data/media) are attracting serious investment. Bitcoin Remains Central: Funding for Bitcoin-centric projects like Roxom Global highlights BTC’s enduring importance in the ecosystem. Dual Approach: Combining financial services (exchange) with information services (media) is seen as a potentially powerful model. This funding round suggests that the market is maturing, with investment flowing towards projects that aim to build sustainable, multi-faceted businesses rather than just speculative tokens. Conclusion: Roxom Global’s Ambitious Path Ahead Roxom Global’s successful $17.9 million funding round marks a significant milestone. With substantial capital allocated to both a unique BTC-denominated Bitcoin exchange and an ambitious 24/7 crypto media network , the company is positioning itself to be a key player in the evolving digital asset landscape. Their strategy of accumulating Bitcoin for their BTC treasury further reinforces their commitment to the ecosystem’s foundational asset. As they move forward, the execution of these plans will be crucial, but the initial Roxom Global funding provides a powerful launchpad for their ambitious vision in the world of crypto investment and beyond.

The company announced that it purchased 4.39 BTC for 5 million Norwegian kroner (approximately $475,000) as part of its long-term Bitcoin Treasury Strategy. The Stockholm-based company offers AI-powered automation and digital solutions for healthcare providers.

2025-05-22T20:49:07.000Z,"Why Did Bitcoin (BTC) Hit a New Record High? Why Are Altcoins Quiet? Analyst Explains Why","Bitcoin hits all-time high, surpassing $111,000 Evaluating the dynamics behind this historic rise, Bitwise Asset Management's Investment Director Matt Hougan stated that the rally has just begun and is a harbinger of a long-term rise. According to Hougan, Bitcoin's rise is driven by two key factors: the increasing interest of institutional investors in the market and indirect support from the US government. “More than $8 billion has flowed into Bitcoin ETFs in the last 30 days. This means new demand against fixed supply and pushes prices up,” Hougan said, adding that the government’s increasing budget deficits and money printing policies have also pushed investors away from fiat currencies, which has increased their focus on Bitcoin. Related News: Following Record Highs in Bitcoin, US Crypto Chief David Sacks Makes Critical Statements Hougan said the rise in long-term government bonds and developments in markets such as Japan suggested investors were losing appetite for borrowing. “The U.S. government is no longer serious about budget cuts. That calls into question the long-term value of the dollar,” he said. Hougan also touched on why this strong performance of Bitcoin was not seen in altcoins, saying that Bitcoin is in a different position as “digital gold.” He said, “Cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Solana should be evaluated more like technology investments,” and stated that it is natural for these assets to perform differently than Bitcoin.

The bill adds that any cryptocurrencies must be held in the form of an exchange-traded product issued by a registered investment company.A similar bill was introduced in February, permitting the state treasurer to allocate up to 10% of Michigan’s Budget Stabilization Fund into crypto.Republican Representative Bryan Posthumus led the introduction of the second bipartisan crypto bill on May 21, HB 4511, which would prohibit Michigan from banning crypto or imposing licensing requirements on crypto holders. It would also prohibit state officials from advocating or supporting a proposed CBDC from the federal government.The bill defines advocating or supporting a CBDC to involve issuing a memorandum or official statement endorsing a CBDC proposal related to its testing, adoption or implementation.Source: Bitcoin LawsMichigan to consider two crypto mining billsHB 4512, the third crypto bill introduced by a bipartisan group led by Democratic Representative Mike McFall, would create a Bitcoin mining program allowing operators to set up at abandoned oil and gas sites. A supervisor would be assigned to determine how much oil or gas could reasonably be expected to be produced from the site, who the last operator of the site was and how long it has been left unused.Related: US Senate moves forward with GENIUS stablecoin billThose seeking to participate in the program would need to submit legal documents outlining their organizational structure, demonstrate their ability to operate as a Bitcoin mining entity and provide estimates of the breakeven price for a profitable venture.The fourth bill, HB 4513 — also filed by a McFall-led bipartisan group — would amend Michigan’s income tax laws to include income obtained from the proposed Bitcoin mining program.Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/michigan-lawmakers-introduce-four-crypto-bills?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

According to a report from My London, Jacob Irwin-Cline went out to a London bar and had several drinks before calling an Uber to take him home.Cline said that he did not thoroughly check the details of the Uber ride on his phone and left with a random private cab driver resembling the Uber driver at first glance, but driving a different vehicle — a detail Cline would only discover after the incident.Once inside the vehicle, the US tourist said the driver offered him a cigarette, which Cline said was likely laced with a rare and potent sedative drug called scopolamine. Cline added that the cigarette made him feel extremely docile and tired, causing him to pass out for around 30 minutes before regaining consciousness.Shortly after Cline woke up, the driver ordered him out of the vehicle. As Cline exited, the driver suddenly sped off, striking him with the car and fleeing with his cellphone, which contained his private keys and access to his crypto accounts.The unfortunate incident comes amid a recent spate of kidnappings, extortion incidents, armed robberies, and ransom attempts directed at crypto industry executives, investors, and their families.

However, Noizat's daughter and another individual were able to fight off the masked attackers.The rise in violent attacks against crypto investors and professionals has prompted an increase in personal security, including requests for bodyguards and private security measures for those likely to be victimized.Magazine: China’s ‘point running’ crypto scams, pig butchers kidnap kids: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/american-tourist-drugged-fake-uber-driver-robbed-123k-btc?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The proposed amendment would come after 18 Democrats sided with Republicans in the Senate in voting to advance the bill on May 20 after it failed a procedural vote on May 8.“Passing the GENIUS Act without our anti-corruption amendment stamps a Congressional seal of approval on Trump selling access and influence to the highest bidder,” Merkley said in a May 22 X post.Trump his three sons are involved in the crypto platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI), which launched its USD1 stablecoin in March. Critics have pointed out that the president could continue to personally benefit from legislation that helps recognize stablecoins like USD1 as financial instruments in the US. Related: US lawmaker introduces anti-corruption bill ahead of Trump’s dinnerAn Abu Dhabi-based investment firm said that it would use USD1 to settle a $2-billion investment in Binance, effectively allowing the president’s family to profit from the transaction fees. Democratic lawmakers have already called for an investigation into Trump’s connections to the platform, which was largely dismissed as “flawed” by WLFI co-founder Zach Witkoff.Stablecoins are just one of many potential conflicts, say DemocratsMerkley and Warren are also planning responses to Trump hosting a dinner at his golf club for up to 220 people who purchased the most significant amounts of his personal memecoin. Merkley is expected to attend a protest organized by the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, in partnership with progressive political organization Our Revolution, outside the Trump venue on May 22. Warren held a press conference with Merkley, Senator Chris Murphy and Public Citizen representatives, calling on Trump to “release the guest list” for the dinner event. Though a few of the potential attendees have publicly announced they were the owners of the wallets who purchased the memecoin and intended to go, the majority were still anonymous at the time of publication.“What is happening tonight — this private, secret dinner — in which individuals who have put money in Donald Trump’s pocket, get access to him, is maybe the most corrupt of all the corruption,” said Murphy, adding:“They were able to pay their way in to get an audience with the President of the United States to ask for favorable national security concessions.”Cointelegraph reached out to the White House for comment, but had not received a response at the time of publication.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/senators-amendment-genius-act-world-liberty-financial-stablecoin?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The $2.2 billion position in futures markets signals growing interest from traders, but it is not necessarily bullish, as those instruments can also be used to speculate on the XRP price downside.XRP futures open interest on major exchanges, XRP. Source: CoinGlassSome traders argue that the increased demand for leveraged XRP positions indicates growing institutional interest, especially as multiple issuers filed for a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) listing in the US. However, the final decision by the US SEC should be made in October.Excessive demand for bullish leveraged XRP causes a positive funding rate, meaning longs (buyers) are the ones paying the carry cost.

Still, the current optimism level is nowhere near the 100% annualized funding rate from Dec. 4, 2024, which followed an impressive 7-day rally to $2.90 from $1.33. Far from being bearish, the current level leaves room for bullish positioning on XRP futures markets.Related: Which senators invest in crypto? 11 lawmakers have blockchain-related investmentsFavorable regulation opens the door for new partnerships and acquisitionsPart of the limited XRP price upside can be explained by the multiple rejections of US Senator Cynthia Lummis, Chair of the US Congress Digital Assets Subcommittee, to meet Ripple representatives. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse asked on May 19 that the lawmaker “reconsider and be a leader for ALL of crypto,” and discuss “how to make the US the crypto capital of the world.”There is nothing stopping XRP from hitting $3.50 or even higher, as Ripple Labs is no longer facing direct threats from regulators, which paves the way for partnerships and acquisitions. Historically, XRP has reacted very positively following those announcements, and the $2.2 billion futures open interest could help catapult XRP price above the current $3.25 all-time high.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

However, SOL needs a clear market structure break (MSB) or a decisive bullish breakout above $180 to trigger the next leg of the rally. Declining volumes during the consolidation phase suggest caution, as a lack of buying pressure could stall the breakout. If SOL fails to breach $180, the immediate key area of interest is between $140-150, and the bull flag pattern would be invalidated.

2025-05-22T15:00:00.000Z,"Semiconductor exemptions don’t matter when it comes to tariffs","Opinion by: Ahmad Shadid of O.xyzSemiconductors scored a rare exemption from US President Donald Trump’s aggressive reciprocal tariffs, but the relief is symbolic at best. Most semiconductors enter the US embedded in servers, GPUs, laptops, and smartphones. The finished goods remain heavily tariffed, some with duties reaching up to 49%. The exemption looks good politically but delivers little practical benefit. Nvidia’s DGX systems, crucial for training advanced AI models, do not fall under the exempted HTS codes. Nvidia could pay effective tariffs nearing 40% on these vital components. Such costs threaten to stall critical AI infrastructure projects across the country. Semiconductor tariffs may compromise the goal of the CHIPS Act. The act promised tens of billions of dollars in subsidies to support domestic chip manufacturing. Yet advanced lithography machines — key equipment from countries like the Netherlands and Japan — face 20%–24% tariffs. Ironically, tariffs designed to boost American production increase the cost of essential manufacturing equipment.The effect of new tariffs is already slowing progress in critical supply chains — just as generative AI and large language models are gaining momentum across sectors like finance and defense. Any delays or cost increases now could blunt America’s technological advantage.Indirect costs undermine exemptions for AIModern semiconductor supply chains are global and highly integrated. An exemption on raw silicon means nothing when servers, GPUs and other finished products face steep tariffs. Tariffs indirectly inflate costs, eliminating any competitive advantage from domestic manufacturing.Indirect tariff costs hit high-end systems disproportionately hard. The effect ripples through AI model training, data center expansions and major infrastructure projects, significantly slowing the industry’s momentum.Tariff impasse halts investmentSo far, it’s clear that the US president’s tariff plan didn’t follow any conventional economic trends or calculated strategy. The uncertain tariff situation stalls investment decisions across the technology sector. Companies need predictable costs to justify large capital expenditures. Ongoing tariff volatility prevents them from committing resources to new data centers and manufacturing lines.This mirrors the supply chain chaos of 2020. At that time, uncertainty caused massive order cancellations and slowed industry recovery for years. If tariff ambiguity continues, we could see similar waves of cancellations in 2025. This would further compound existing inventory and revenue issues in the semiconductor sector.Domestic production is not optimalThe border argument for these tariffs is that they’re meant to boost domestic production. They do little, however, to encourage genuine domestic semiconductor production. Despite subsidies under the CHIPS Act, most US semiconductor companies still rely on international foundries for manufacturing. Instead, they face increased equipment and operational costs.Recent: How trade wars impact stocks and cryptoThe idea that tariffs promote domestic production ignores the reality of global semiconductor manufacturing. Costs rise across the board, putting American companies at a disadvantage rather than offering protection.AI projects face heightened riskThe blockchain and crypto sectors, particularly AI-driven projects, also feel the pinch. Projects depend heavily on GPUs and high-performance servers for mining, validating transactions and running decentralized AI computations. Increased hardware costs directly affect profitability and growth, potentially stalling innovation in blockchain applications. AI developments have just started to pick up the pace in the blockchain and Web3 space. The industry saw increased interest from investors and VCs just a year ago. So, they are still on tighter budgets. Elevated costs can, however, lead to stagnation. We might see innovators and developers exiting the market. The ripple effect extends beyond the general technology sector and could threaten future digital economies. Moreover, these cost pressures disproportionately affect startups and smaller tech firms. Industry giants can absorb additional expenses, but innovative, smaller players face existential threats. This dynamic risks stifling innovation at the grassroots level, harming the entire tech ecosystem.What to expect Semiconductors have momentarily escaped direct tariffs, but the exemption provides little benefit. Tariffs continue to hit finished products, driving up indirect costs across the industry. Instead of boosting domestic manufacturing, these tariffs create economic paralysis, stall critical infrastructure projects, and threaten America’s lead in AI innovation. Policymakers must acknowledge these realities and adjust their approach before irreversible damage is done to the nation’s technological future.Opinion by: Ahmad Shadid of O.xyz.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

When you do, you don’t own enough NFT’s, as art is upstream of wealth. Both will never be this cheap again,” Pal said.NFTs are “the single best long term store of wealth I know and you get to buy it before network effects kick in,” he added in another response.Source: Raoul Pal“There is some validity to the statement that NFTs, and in extension art, become a vehicle for the wealthy once a certain level of wealth is reached,” wrote Nicolai Sondergaard, research analyst at Nansen, calling it a “natural move” for asset diversification.“For traders and investors, further down the wealth curve, NFTs are partially about speculating on future returns,” he told Cointelegraph, adding that NFTs also benefit from the allure of strong communities, beyond just wealth creation.Related: German gov’t missed out on $2.3B profit after selling Bitcoin at $57KArt NFTs may see a resurgence as “digital ownership gains acceptance among younger, tech-savvy cohorts,” if collections manage to move past the “speculative fervor,” according to Anndy Lian, author and intergovernmental blockchain expert.Still, Lian said broader adoption depends on blockchain networks improving scalability and security to “instill confidence.” He added that art NFTs “must transcend hype, anchoring value in cultural significance or utility.”  Beeple’s “Everydays: The First 5000 Days.” Source: ChristiesSome digital artists made millions of dollars through NFTs.

2025-05-22T13:30:00.000Z,"How staking incentivizes trust without burning energy","What if a financial system could run itself not by burning electricity, but by rewarding good behavior? That’s the promise of staking, a mechanism that powers many modern blockchains by turning users into network operators. In this week’s episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Gareth Jenkinson and Nathan Jeffay sit down with StarkWare’s Noam Nisan to unpack how this trustless engine works, why it matters and what’s really at stake.Understanding stakingJeffay began by highlighting how staking is part of the backbone that keeps the blockchain running, and runs itself, with volunteers.“By doing this, they’re saying, OK, we’re taking this task of running the blockchain seriously. Here's some of our money. We're putting it down. We're showing that we're serious about doing this.”To help unpack this topic further and examine the deeper mechanics behind staking, the hosts are joined by Noam Nisan, principal researcher at StarkWare and a widely respected computer scientist who has held roles at Google and Princeton.Related: How to handle crypto trading gains and losses on your balance sheet“So we have this general system with operators... Why would they want to do that? The system, the protocol, incentivizes them to actually run the system,” Nisan explained. “Basically, it can give them tokens for operating the system.”Staking offers what Nisan describes as two distinct types of security: computer science-based guarantees and economic disincentives for bad actors. “If a majority or supermajority, maybe two-thirds of the parties of the token of the staked amount are behaving properly... we can prove that the system acts correctly,” he said. “But you also have what I would call an economic guarantee... if they destroy the system, very likely the value of the token... will go down. So they are the one losing.”PoW vs PoSJenkinson, a vocal Bitcoin (BTC) supporter, posed the classic comparison: proof-of-work vs proof-of-stake. “Do you have any strong feelings about one or the other?” he asked.“The truth is that it’s not clear.. it's really a social question, I think.”Nisan noted that both mechanisms involve trade-offs around cost, control, and decentralization. The episode also explores the role of staking in tokenomics and system design. Nisan unpacks how fee mechanics and inflation controls, such as Ethereum’s minting curve, help keep the ecosystem in balance.To hear the full conversation on The Clear Crypto Podcast,  listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

2025-05-22T12:38:44.000Z,"UK court partially dismisses Bitcoin SV investor’s lawsuit against Binance","The United Kingdom’s Court of Appeal has partially dismissed a lawsuit brought by Bitcoin SV investors against major crypto exchanges, including Binance, for allegedly conspiring to delist the token in 2019.In a judgment handed down on May 21, the court ruled that investors who held BSV through the delisting period (classified as “sub-class B”) were not entitled to billions in speculative damages based on BSV’s hypothetical growth.These investors had claimed over 8.9 billion British pounds ($11.9 billion) in damages, asserting that Binance’s delisting deprived holders of the chance to profit from BSV’s potential rise to a “top-tier cryptocurrency” like Bitcoin (BTC) or Bitcoin Cash (BCH).The court rejected this “foregone growth effect” theory, stating, “BSV was obviously not a unique cryptocurrency without reasonably similar substitutes,” pointing to the representative’s own use of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash as comparators.Sub-class B’s central claim was that delisting led to a missed opportunity to benefit from price appreciation. However, the court determined that those investors had ample chance to mitigate losses by selling or reinvesting in other crypto assets.“They had a duty to mitigate their losses,” wrote Master of the Rolls Sir Geoffrey Vos. “They cannot recover losses that they could reasonably have mitigated.”UK court ruling against Bitcoin SV investor’s lawsuit.

2025-05-22T10:21:18.000Z,"Can ChatGPT-powered AI agents really trade crypto for you?","Key takeawaysChatGPT-powered AI agents automate trading tasks using natural language prompts and API integrations, improving speed and consistency.Successes occur when ChatGPT is used as a support tool, not a fully autonomous trading system.Failures happen when traders over-rely on ChatGPT without real-time data, proper risk management or manual oversight.Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance.What if a crypto trader didn’t need to constantly check charts, worry about emotions, or stay up all night watching for sudden price swings? What if those tasks could be handled by an intelligent agent that understands instructions in plain English — and reacts within milliseconds? That’s where ChatGPT-powered AI agents come in.These tools combine natural language processing with real-time trading logic to automate decision-making in one of the world’s most volatile markets. From rebalancing portfolios to reacting to market sentiment, ChatGPT is being adapted to act as a trading assistant, risk manager and market analyst — all rolled into one. But can it truly match or even outperform human intuition? This article explores how far these agents have come, where they shine and where they still fall short.How ChatGPT-powered AI agents operate in cryptocurrency marketsChatGPT-powered AI agents are changing how people interact with crypto markets. These tools combine ChatGPT’s language abilities with external trading tools and APIs to help users monitor prices, understand trends and even place trades automatically. Instead of just reacting to charts or numbers, ChatGPT can understand plain language commands like “Buy Ethereum if the price drops below $2,000” or “Sell Bitcoin if RSI goes above 70.”These AI trading assistants can work with major platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, OKX and other centralized or decentralized exchanges and can also tap into decentralized finance (DeFi) tools and smart contracts. With the right setup, ChatGPT can help automate trading strategies based on both technical data and market news.Success stories vs. failures in ChatGPT-powered crypto tradingSome traders have used ChatGPT to assist in automating parts of their crypto trading processes, particularly for strategy generation and sentiment analysis. For example, a user shared on Reddit that they used a ChatGPT-based AI agent for technical analysis on Ether (ETH), feeding it four-hour and daily chart screenshots. By interpreting market sentiment, support and resistance zones, and other indicators, they managed to make $6,500 in profits.Similarly, in the broader crypto sector, ChatGPT has been applied to support project development activities such as drafting white papers and marketing content. A notable example is the launch of the “TURBO” memecoin, which reportedly reached a market capitalization of over $50 million in 2024. In this case, ChatGPT was used to streamline documentation and communication rather than manage trading activity, illustrating its usefulness as a support tool in crypto-related initiatives.However, limitations are evident when ChatGPT is applied beyond its core design. While ChatGPT could suggest a trading portfolio and explain its reasoning clearly, it lacks access to real-time market data and couldn’t respond to sudden volatility. In one instance, ChatGPT was allocated $100 across multiple tokens but failed to actively manage the portfolio as prices fluctuated. This resulted in missed opportunities and underperformance compared to dynamic algorithmic strategies.Individual experiences reinforce these observations. A Redditor exposed a scam where a YouTuber promoted a “ChatGPT trading bot” tutorial that led users to deploy malicious smart contracts. The contracts, generated using ChatGPT and passed off as safe, were designed to drain user wallets once funded. Victims collectively lost $17,240 in ETH, highlighting the danger of blindly trusting AI-generated code without proper auditing.Even when asked, “If I use ChatGPT to build an AI agent for crypto trading, can I become a millionaire?” ChatGPT responded with a realistic outlook — acknowledging that while it’s possible, success depends on having a profitable strategy, disciplined risk management, and the ability to scale effectively.Here is ChatGPT’s response:These cases suggest that while ChatGPT can support certain elements of the trading process, it should not be treated as a standalone solution for autonomous crypto trading.AI in crypto trading: Key benefits and limitationsAI tools like ChatGPT are increasingly being integrated into crypto trading workflows to improve speed, accuracy and efficiency. While they offer important advantages, they also carry specific limitations that traders must actively manage. Below are the main benefits and challenges:Key benefits of using AI for crypto tradingAI bots can execute trades in milliseconds, crucial for capturing opportunities in fast-moving crypto markets.Bots follow pre-programmed rules precisely, eliminating emotional biases that often affect human traders.Crypto markets are always open, and AI bots can monitor and act around the clock without interruption.A single bot can manage multiple trading pairs, exchanges and strategies simultaneously.ChatGPT can understand specific prompts like “Rebalance every Monday” or “Set stop-loss at 5%,” allowing flexible automation.Limitations of ChatGPT in cryptocurrency tradingChatGPT does not access live market data unless specifically integrated with external APIs (e.g., TradingView, CoinMarketCap or exchange websockets).Instructions must be clear and unambiguous; ChatGPT may misinterpret vague or complex commands.Improperly secured API keys or lack of two-factor authentication (2FA) can expose trading accounts to unauthorized access.ChatGPT’s cloud-based infrastructure can introduce latency, which could impact performance during highly volatile periods.ChatGPT does not monitor regional compliance rules; users must manually enforce trading limits based on local regulations.Ethical and regulatory implications of AI in crypto tradingAs AI becomes more integrated into trading systems, it raises significant ethical and regulatory concerns that stakeholders across the financial sector are beginning to address.Accountability: If an AI agent executes a harmful or unlawful trade, questions arise around legal responsibility. It remains unclear in many jurisdictions whether liability falls primarily on the developer, the trader using the AI system or the platform facilitating the transactions.Market manipulation risks: Autonomous AI bots could unintentionally engage in activities such as spoofing (placing and canceling fake orders to mislead the market) or wash trading (creating artificial volume), especially if not properly programmed with compliance safeguards.Regulatory oversight: Financial authorities, including the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the European Securities and Markets Authority, are actively studying the implications of AI and algorithmic trading. These agencies have recognized that traditional trading regulations may not fully account for autonomous decision-making by AI systems.Policy developments: In January 2024, the European Commission released updates to its Digital Finance Strategy, which included references to AI-based financial services. While not yet finalized, these draft regulations under the broader Digital Finance Package signal a move toward stricter compliance expectations for firms deploying AI in financial markets.Meanwhile, ethical crypto platforms are beginning to voluntarily disclose the use of trading bots in their systems. In parallel, open-source communities are advocating for clearer audit trails, improved model transparency and the establishment of ethical guidelines for AI applications in finance to ensure accountability and fairness.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-22T08:37:57.000Z,"Dubai regulator clarifies real-world asset tokenization rules: Lawyer","Newly updated guidelines from Dubai’s crypto regulator include provisions on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and clarify rules for issuers. On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) released its updated Rulebook for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) operating in the region. The regulator gave market participants until June 19 to comply with the new rules. The regulator previously told Cointelegraph that it had enhanced supervisory mechanisms and brought consistency across activity-based rules. One of the more prominent changes includes regulatory clarity on RWA tokens. Irina Heaver, partner at the United Arab Emirates-based law firm NeosLegal, told Cointelegraph that the updated rules clarify RWA issuance and distribution. “Issuing real-world asset tokens and listing them on secondary markets is no longer theoretical,” Heaver told Cointelegraph. “It’s now a regulatory reality in Dubai and the broader UAE.”A “viable” path to realize RWA hypeHeaver compared RWAs to security token offerings (STOs), an earlier attempt from the crypto space to tokenize securities like stocks, bonds and real estate investment trusts. However, the UAE crypto lawyer said that STOs “died a peaceful death in 2018 to 2019.” The lawyer told Cointelegraph STOs did not work out because of the lack of regulatory clarity, viable secondary market trading venues, institutional investor appetite and liquidity. Still, the situation is different for RWAs. Heaver told Cointelegraph that RWAs are the next foundational layer for institutional adoption of blockchain and virtual assets. Heaver said that VARA’s new rules already cover them as Asset-Referenced Virtual Assets (ARVA) tokens. She said: “VARA’s newly updated Virtual Asset Issuance Rulebook (May 2025) addresses these failures head-on.

2025-05-22T08:25:00.000Z,"5 red flags you’re being shilled: Don’t buy the hype","What is shilling in crypto?              At its core, shilling is the act of artificially promoting a cryptocurrency or token, often with exaggerated claims, to increase its price or popularity. But what’s the goal? Hype it up, get others to buy in, and then cash out, leaving latecomers holding the bag.Shilling can come from anyone: influencers, anonymous accounts or even high-profile figures with political or financial clout. The common thread is manipulation: It’s not about educating you or building real value but pumping hype for personal gain.Unfortunately, the line between enthusiastic promotion and outright deception can be thin, and many fall victim without realizing it. That’s why it’s critical to learn how to spot the signs early.                  5 red flags you’re being shilled              Beware of crypto red flags like overhyped promises, anonymous teams, influencer shills, missing products and FOMO tactics — if it smells like a scam, it probably is.1. Overhyped promises You’ve probably seen posts that scream:“100x potential!”“Guaranteed returns!”“This is your ticket to financial freedom!”These are classic shill tactics. Real, credible projects don’t promise life-changing profits. Why? Because there are no guarantees in crypto or in any investment.When a project leads with grandiose financial claims rather than actual product value or utility, it’s likely a ploy to stir FOMO and attract unsuspecting investors. The truth is, if something sounds too good to be true, it almost always is.Remember: The bigger the promise, the bigger the red flag.2. Anonymous or suspicious teams In crypto, anonymity isn’t always bad, but when you’re trusting people with your money, transparency matters.It’s a major red flag when a project has:No identifiable team membersFake names or aliasesStock photos on its websiteNo LinkedIn or professional history.The simple rule is “No face, no funds.”Scammers often hide behind anonymity because they know they’ll eventually vanish and there’ll be no one to hold accountable. Even worse, some use fabricated credentials or hire actors to pose as team members.Before investing, check whether the founders or developers have any verifiable history. Do they have prior experience in blockchain or startups? Have they launched anything successful before?3. Influencer spam and paid promotions One day, no one’s talking about a particular coin — the next, your feed is flooded with influencers hyping it up. Sound familiar?This sudden burst of attention is often coordinated with a paid promotion campaign disguised as “genuine enthusiasm.”Many influencers fail to disclose sponsorships, even though it’s required by law in many countries. The US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have cracked down on this in recent years.Take, for example:Kim Kardashian, who was fined $1.26 million in 2022 for promoting EthereumMax without proper disclosure.Floyd Mayweather Jr., who was sued for endorsing the same project at a paid event.BitBoy (Ben Armstrong), who faced legal action in multiple lawsuits for promoting scam tokens to his audience.If you notice multiple influencers promoting the same project in a short time, especially without using labels like #ad or #sponsored, it’s a strong indicator of a shill campaign.Don’t mistake volume for value. Hype doesn’t equal legitimacy.4. No real product or roadmapIf you visit the project’s website, it looks sleek, maybe even impressive. But where’s the product? Where’s the code?Shilled tokens often rely on flashy marketing but have no working application, no GitHub code and no actual use case. Everything is either “coming soon” or buried behind vague promises.Ask yourself:Can I use the platform or app today?Is there a white paper that makes sense?Do they have public repositories or open development?If all you’re seeing is a landing page and a vague roadmap that’s been “coming soon” for months, that’s a major red flag.5. Pressure tactics and FOMO Time pressure is a psychological weapon, and shillers know how to use it.Watch out for lines such as:“Presale ends in 2 hours!”“Only 1,000 spots left!”“If you don’t buy now, you’ll miss out forever!”These tactics prey on your fear of missing out (FOMO) and push you into making impulsive decisions without research.But crypto isn’t a sprint; it’s a long-term game. Anyone trying to rush you into buying likely has something to hide. Solid investments don’t need fake urgency.Take a breath, step back, and ask yourself: Am I buying because I believe in this project or because I’m being manipulated?Did you know? The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) secured a $128-million judgment against Ryan Mitchell Pope, Daniel Samuel Bishop and their company EmpiresX for operating a fraudulent forex and cryptocurrency investment scheme that defrauded over 12,500 victims.                  Is shilling illegal in crypto? Can influencers be sued?              Shilling isn’t just unethical in many cases — it’s also illegal.In the world of crypto, undisclosed promotions are a major legal risk. If someone is paid to promote a token or project but fails to reveal that financial connection, they could face fines, lawsuits or even criminal charges. This is especially true if the promoted token is later classified as a security under US law.Regulators like the SEC, FTC and CFTC have all cracked down on this behavior. Their targets have included:Influencers who failed to disclose paid promotionsPromoters who misled investors with false claimsIndividuals who ran pump-and-dump schemes using social media.Francier Obando Pinillo, a pastor from Miami, was indicted on 26 fraud counts for running a crypto scam through “Solano Fi,” defrauding investors of millions from 2021 to 2023. He allegedly used his church, social media and false promises of 34.9% monthly returns to lure victims. The platform showed fake gains but blocked withdrawals, while funds were diverted for personal use. Pinillo was arraigned in Richland, Washington and faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.As crypto becomes more mainstream, expect stricter regulations and more consequences for shillers.Did you know? Argentine President Javier Milei has dissolved the special task force investigating the LIBRA cryptocurrency scandal, a project he promoted in February 2025 that surged to a $4.5-billion valuation before crashing by over 97%. The task force, created by Milei himself, was disbanded via Decree 332/2025, citing that it had fulfilled its purpose. However, critics argue that no official findings were released, and judicial investigations into Milei and his associates continue.                  How to protect yourself from shilling scams              Do your own research, verify the team and utility, ignore hype and influencers, and stay alert to pump-and-dump schemes to avoid crypto shilling traps.Let’s understand how you can protect yourself from shilling scams in crypto:Do your own research (DYOR): Always research the project, the team behind it and the data supporting the claims. Don’t rely solely on hype or influencer recommendations. Look into onchain data, GitHub activity and the project’s utility to make informed decisions.Verify the team: A legitimate crypto project should have a transparent and credible team. If the developers are anonymous or have no professional profiles (like LinkedIn), that’s a red flag. Always check the team’s past projects and credibility before investing.Look for real utility: Does this project actually solve a problem? A genuine project should have a working product or solution, not just promises. Avoid projects that lack real-world utility or are still in “coming soon” stages for extended periods.Ignore the hype: If a token is suddenly trending on social media or being aggressively promoted, don’t let FOMO influence your judgment. Shillers often rely on emotions to push their agenda, so it’s essential to evaluate projects based on their merits, not just popularity.Stay skeptical of influencers: Influencers with large followings may be paid to promote certain tokens. Before taking their advice, ask yourself, What’s their incentive? Verify the promotion is legitimate and disclosed as paid or sponsored. Always cross-check the information with independent sources.Watch for pump-and-dump schemes: Be cautious of sudden price spikes followed by rapid drops. These are often signs of pump-and-dump schemes where the token’s value is artificially inflated by coordinated buying and then quickly sold off, leaving investors with losses. Always monitor price trends and be wary of sudden, unexplained increases in value.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/5-red-flags-youre-being-shilled-dont-buy-the-hype?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Seeker is the company’s second-generation device, after the Saga Web3 phone that launched in April 2023. The company unveiled the Seeker phone in September 2024, saying it wouldn’t just be a “memecoin phone.” So far, it has pre-sold 150,000 units.The Solana Seeker has gone through two sale phases: The Founder window, where the price for each device was $450, and the Early Adopter window, where the price per device was $500. Assuming the lower price window, Solana Mobile could generate at least $67.5 million in gross revenue from device sales. For comparison, the iPhone generated $199.3 billion in revenue for Apple in 2024.The new architecture that will govern future Solana Mobile devices is called TEEPIN, which stands for “Trusted Execution Environment Platform Infrastructure Network.” It is a three-layer architecture — hardware, platform, and network layers — that will allow users, developers, and device makers to participate in a trustless environment.Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder and CEO of Solana Labs, called TEEPIN “the next evolution in mobile” and a framework where trust is “verified by cryptography.”In addition, Solana Mobile is planning to launch “SKR,” the native asset of the Solana Mobile ecosystem. \""It transforms the traditional mobile business model by giving stakeholders actual ownership in the platform,” said Emmett Hollyer, general manager at Solana Mobile.

This data supports the idea that derivatives markets were not the main driver of the recent price increases. Moreover, the $1.37 billion in net inflows to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States between May 15 and May 20 further suggests that spot buyers, rather than derivatives traders, were the primary force behind the rally.Despite the lack of conviction in Bitcoin futures, several indicators point to further upside. Forced liquidations of bearish BTC futures positions were relatively low at $170 million between May 18 and May 21, cementing the idea of a spot-driven rally. In comparison, the rally to $104,000 on May 9 triggered $538 million in liquidations over three days.Related: Is Bitcoin price close to a cycle top? — 5 indicators that help traders decideBitcoin options put-to-call ratio at Deribit.

For comparison, the put-to-call ratio at Deribit dropped to 0.4x during the previous bull run on Jan. 20, reflecting lower confidence due to reduced volumes in call (buy) options.Bitcoin’s upward movement may have been limited by macroeconomic factors, especially as the tariff war continues. Still, the potential for the price to reach $110,000 and higher is partly based on the weak position of the US Federal Reserve. Injecting liquidity could ease recession concerns, but it also reduces the appeal of government bonds, which favors risk-on assets like Bitcoin.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Bitcoin’s strength is expected to improve sentiment in the cryptocurrency sector, pulling several altcoins higher.What are the possible target levels for Bitcoin? Could altcoins break above their respective overhead resistance levels? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin price predictionBitcoin rose above the $109,588 overhead resistance, but the bulls are struggling to sustain the higher levels, as seen from the long wick on the candlestick.BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) in the overbought zone indicate that the bulls are in control. If the price closes above $109,588, the BTC/USDT pair could pick up momentum and skyrocket toward $130,000.The 20-day exponential moving average ($101,958) is the critical support to watch out for on the downside. A break below the 20-day EMA will be the first sign that the bulls are booking profits in a hurry. That increases the risk of a break below the psychological support of $100,000. Ether price predictionBuyers are trying to sustain Ether (ETH) above the $2,550 level but are facing significant resistance from the bears.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping 20-day EMA ($2,334) and the RSI near the overbought zone indicate that buyers are in control. The ETH/USDT pair is likely to pick up momentum on a break above $2,739. That clears the path for a rally to $3,000.Contrary to this assumption, a break and close below the 20-day EMA signals that the bears are back in the game. The pair could tumble to $2,111, which is likely to attract solid buying by the bulls.XRP price predictionXRP (XRP) has been witnessing a tough battle between the buyers and sellers at the 20-day EMA ($2.35).XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. If the price skids below the 20-day EMA, the XRP/USDT pair may stay inside the $2 to $2.65 range for a while. Instead, if the price turns up sharply from the 20-day EMA and breaks above $2.65, the advantage will tilt in favor of the bulls. The pair could rally to $3 and, after that, to $3.40, where the sellers are expected to mount a strong defense.BNB price predictionBNB (BNB) bulls have held the 20-day EMA ($639) support during the pullback, indicating buying on dips. BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bulls will try to push the price above $693 but are expected to face solid selling by the bears. However, if buyers bulldoze their way through, the BNB/USDT pair could skyrocket to the overhead resistance at $745.This optimistic view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and breaks below the 20-day EMA. That could sink the pair to the 50-day SMA ($609). Solana price predictionSellers failed to pull Solana (SOL) below the 20-day EMA ($164), indicating demand at lower levels.SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bulls will try to propel the price above the $185 overhead resistance. If they can pull it off, the SOL/USDT pair could accelerate toward the target objective of $210 and then $220.If sellers want to prevent the upside, they will have to quickly tug the price below the 20-day EMA. The pair could slide to $153 and later to the 50-day SMA ($145). That suggests a possible range-bound action between $120 and $180.Dogecoin price predictionDogecoin (DOGE) has bounced off the breakout level of $0.21, indicating that buyers are active at lower levels.DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe 20-day EMA ($0.21) is trending up, and the RSI is in the positive zone, signaling that buyers are in command.

If the price turns down sharply from the overhead resistance, the pair could form a narrow range between $0.26 and $0.21 for some time.Contrarily, a break and close above $0.26 signals the start of the next leg of the up move.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewBuyers will have to drive and maintain the price above the $23.50 resistance to gain the upper hand.

If buyers overcome the $26.84 barrier, the pair could ascend to $31.73 and subsequently to $36.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance and breaks below the 50-day SMA, it suggests that the bulls have given up.

2025-05-21T17:55:00.000Z,"Interest groups, lawmakers to protest Trump&#039;s memecoin dinner","Democratic leaning organizations and members of Congress have announced plans to protest what they describe as the sale of access to the office of the US president, in reference to Donald Trump’s memecoin dinner on May 22. The event’s attendees are said to have collectively spent over $100 million for the chance to meet with the US president.Since Trump’s memecoin project, Official Trump (TRUMP), announced that its top 220 tokenholders would have an opportunity to apply for an exclusive dinner with the president, many leaders in the crypto industry and US lawmakers have criticized the event, saying Trump was opening his office to potential bribery and corruption. The memecoin dinner prompted some Democratic lawmakers to withdraw support for crypto-related legislation in Congress, including the market structure and stablecoin bills.“Trump collecting gifts from foreign governments is unconstitutional,” a spokesperson for the consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen, which is planning to protest near the memecoin dinner on May 22, told Cointelegraph. “Collecting foreign government investments through his memecoin is not much better. American foreign policy should not be for sale.”Source: Public CitizenCrypto industry figures such as Tron founder Justin Sun, Kronos Research chief investment officer Vincent Liu, Hyperithm co-CEO Oh Sangrok, and Synthetix founder Kain Warwick are among the tokenholders expected to attend the dinner at the Trump National Golf Club outside Washington, DC. The memecoin project said all applicants had to pass a background check and could not be from a “[Know Your Customer] watchlist country.”Related: Democrats seek suspicious activity reports linked to Trump crypto venturesPublic Citizen, in partnership with progressive political organization Our Revolution, will hold a rally near the golf club, which Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley is expected to attend. In addition, the Arlington and Loudoun Democrats will be hosting a separate event to urge US officials to “hold [Trump] accountable,” and Democratic leadership in Congress has scheduled two press events on May 22 ahead of the dinner.“Americans cannot and will not accept President Trump’s view that positions of power exist only to benefit the holder of that power,” Ryan Ruzic, chair of the Loudoun County Democratic Committee, told Cointelegraph. “We have a moral responsibility to speak out against corruption, whatever the result may be.”Pushback on TRUMP memecoin affected crypto legislationSome lawmakers initially cited the memecoin dinner and the Trump family’s involvement with the crypto platform World Liberty Financial in opposing passage of the GENIUS Act, a bill to regulate payment stablecoins. World Liberty Financial began issuing its own USD1 stablecoin in March, prompting concerns about Trump’s conflicts of interest. However, the legislation passed a key procedural vote in the Senate on May 19 with support from Democrats, setting the bill up for debate in the chamber.“Many senators, myself included, have very real concerns about the Trump family’s use of crypto technologies to evade oversight, hide shady financial dealings, and personally profit at the expense of everyday Americans,” said Sen. Mark Warner in a statement before the May 19 vote, adding: “But we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay.”Senator Chris Murphy, who voted against advancing the GENIUS Act, called for bipartisan support in amending the bill to specifically bar a US president from issuing stablecoins. He also called on the White House to release a complete list of attendees to the memecoin dinner, suggesting that some or all of them would “try to get something from the president” in exchange for purchasing the tokens. Murphy and Senator Elizabeth Warren will attend a press event with representatives for Public Citizen on May 22. California Representative Maxine Waters, ranking member of the US House Financial Services Committee, announced a separate press conference for the same day, with plans to introduce a bill to “block Trump’s memecoin and stop his crypto corruption, once and for all.”As of May 21, the exact number of attendees to the dinner was unknown. A smaller group of 25 tokenholders also qualified to apply for “VIP tour” and reception — presumably at the White House — with Trump, but the complete list of those planning to attend was also unknown at the time of publication.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/protest-donald-trump-memecoin-dinner?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-21T17:02:48.000Z,"Is Bitcoin price close to a cycle top? — 5 indicators that help traders decide","Key takeaways:Bitcoin market cycle tops are notoriously hard to time, but combining technical and behavioral indicators can offer strong signals.The MVRV-Z Score, Pi Cycle Top indicator, trade volume trends, Puell Multiple, and exchange inflows accurately predict Bitcoin price cycle tops.Bitcoin (BTC) might be approaching the final stage of its current market cycle — a dramatic final rally followed by a sharp correction and, eventually, a bear market. For many, this could be the long-awaited climax of the past four years, and major players are preparing accordingly.Since late 2024, Bitcoin whale accumulation has surged. Glassnode data shows that the number of addresses holding over 100 BTC has jumped by almost 14%, reaching 18,200 — a level not seen since 2017. The biggest market players appear to be positioning for what could be this cycle’s final run-up.Number of BTC addresses holding over 100 BTC. Source: GlassnodeHowever, riding the rally is trickier than it looks and knowing when to exit is notoriously difficult. The lure of higher price highs fuels FOMO, driving investors to buy the top, only to face painful drawdowns or even liquidations.So, how can traders and investors spot the top before the market enters recession?Bitcoin cycle top markersSeveral technical and onchain indicators, such as MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Z-score, Pi Cycle Top, and trading volume trends, have historically been reliable in signaling when Bitcoin is nearing its peak.The MVRV-Z score compares Bitcoin’s market value to its realized value and adjusts for volatility. A high Z-score suggests Bitcoin is significantly overvalued relative to its historical cost basis. When this indicator is at a historical high, the ensuing downward trend in Bitcoin prices is likely.The Pi Cycle Top tracks BTC price dynamics using moving averages. When the 111-day moving average (111-SMA) crosses above twice the 350-day average (350-SMAx2), it signals overheating. In other words, when the short-term trend catches up to the long-term trajectory, a market top is in.Historically, all previous Bitcoin bull runs started with a notable surge in MVRV Z-score, and ended with 111-SMA crossing the longer-term trend.BTC: Pi Cycle Top + MVRV Z-score. Source: Marie Poteriaieva, GlassnodeAdditionally, lower trading volumes during price increases can be a warning sign, often signaling weakening momentum and potential for a reversal. On-balance volume (OBV), which registers cumulative volume flow, is a valuable metric for tracking this process. When OBV diverges from the price action, it is often an early reversal signal. The second leg of the 2021 bull run was a great example. While BTC price was hitting higher highs of $68,000 (compared to the previous all-time high of $63,170), trading volumes moved in a different direction, decreasing from 710,000 BTC to 628,000 BTC. This created a bearish divergence between price and volume, suggesting that fewer market participants were supporting the rally — a classic sign of waning momentum.BTC/USD 1-day, OBV. Source: Marie Poteriaieva, TradingViewProfit-taking metricsAs market cycle tops approach, long-term holders and Bitcoin miners often start locking in profits. Some valuable metrics that can track it are the Puell Multiple and exchange flows.The Puell Multiple Indicator looks at miners' revenue relative to its 365-day average. High readings indicate miners may start selling aggressively, and are often seen near market tops.Large inflows to exchanges are usually signs of distribution, as investors prepare to sell their coins. BTC total transfer volume to exchanges + Puell Multiple. Source: Marie Poteriaieva, GlassnodeIndividually, these indicators can mark various shifts in market trends. Combined, they often align with cycle tops.Related: Sorry bears — Bitcoin analysis dismisses $107K BTC price double topThe 15% ruleHistoric price activity observations might come in handy, too. Crypto market analyst Cole Garner shared his exit playbook based on whales’ behavior. His roadmap includes three steps:Euphoria. Bitcoin moves vertically for weeks, with massive $10,000+ daily candles.Whiplash. Bitcoin experiences its sharpest correction of the bull cycle. The curved parabolic trendline that’s supported the rally is broken — a clear signal that the top is likely in. Meanwhile, altcoins and meme tokens may continue pumping a little longer.Complacency. Measure 15% below Bitcoin’s all-time high. That’s the sell zone. Order books on major exchanges often show a wall of sell orders around this level — a likely institutional exit point.According to Garner, the 15% (or 16%) rule works not only in crypto but in traditional markets as well.Historical blow off-tops: BTC, ETH, gold, Nasdaq, Nikkei, Broadvision, 3D Systems. Source: Cole GarnerNo single indicator can pinpoint the exact moment to exit, especially in a shifting macro environment. But when multiple signals align, they become hard to ignore.
