2025-05-23T05:35:08.000Z,"CME Group Fuels XRP ETF Hope","Levi Rietveld, a respected crypto analyst and founder of Crypto Crusaders, has commented on the strong performance of XRP futures since their debut on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). In a recent post , he noted that the contracts are doing exceptionally, noting that they have pulled in almost $30 million since the launch. He also pointed to the growing interest as a possible catalyst for regulatory movement on a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). With over ten XRP spot ETF applications pending, the success and appeal of the futures contracts may influence the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) stance. Strong Early Trading Points to Institutional Demand CME’s XRP futures officially launched on May 19 , including standard-sized (50,000 XRP) and micro (2,500 XRP) contracts. These contracts are cash-settled in U.S. dollars and based on the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate, which is calculated daily. The first day alone saw about $19 million in trades , while the second day added another $7 million. These figures signal substantial institutional engagement, placing XRP alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana as the only cryptocurrencies with futures contracts on CME. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The fast increase in volume suggests that XRP is increasingly seen as a viable asset in institutional portfolios. The regulated environment provided by CME offers a compliant gateway for exposure to XRP price movements, especially for firms that do not wish to hold the underlying token directly. The Path to Spot XRP ETFs The performance of the CME XRP futures has direct implications for broader regulatory developments, particularly the potential approval of a spot XRP ETF. Levi highlighted this connection, pointing out that the strong institutional demand has renewed speculation about ETFs. The swift institutional uptake in a regulated setting may strengthen the case for the SEC to approve such products. The fact that more than ten applications for spot XRP ETFs are pending further supports the notion that the market is actively preparing for such a shift. Historically, futures have played a role in ETF approval decisions, and experts have previously pointed to the lack of XRP futures as a reason why ETFs would not be approved . Bitcoin and Ethereum futures were established on CME before spot ETFs were approved in the U.S., and XRP may follow a similar trajectory if current trading patterns remain consistent.

2025-05-23T05:32:02.000Z,"BITCOIN PRICE ANALYSIS & PREDICTION (May 23) – BTC Hits New All-Time High Following 30% Increases in a Month","Following a consistent recovery from a broad corrective phase, Bitcoin finally reached a new milestone today after over 30 days of trading. This came as a result of a major price break as bigger moves lie ahead. The recent rally in Bitcoin was initiated last month after recovering from a short-term correction level of $74.5k. This brought a renewed hope for the bulls as the price closed well at around $97k – above March’s high. Due to a rejection, it pulled back slightly earlier this month and bounced back with a major surge above the crucial $100k level in the first week. Consolidating throughout last week with a strong close above $109.5k, it recovered fully to the top following a steady increase in demand. Breaking to a new all-time high today, Bitcoin just hinted a new macro bullish wave, and from the look of things, altcoins are expected to follow suit once it suspends the latest surge into a consolidation mode. However, it is important to note that bigger moves lie ahead for the giant crypto in the long-term as long as capital continues to flow well into the market. In fact, with the latest market sentiments and speculations, coupled with some strong fundamentals surround the market, BTC may end this cycle at around $140k. BTC’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Anticipating more surges above the current high of $111,888, the $115k and $120k levels would be the next bulls’ target in the coming days. The previously broken all-time high of $109,588 now acts as support for the primary cryptocurrency. Below it lies $106,457. If all these supports fail in a pullback, it may revisit the $100,718 level before rebounding. Key Resistance Levels: $111,888, $115,000, $120,000 Key Support Levels: $109,588, $106,457, 100,718 Spot Price: $110,756 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

2025-05-23T05:30:00.000Z,"Tourist Loses $123K in Bitcoin in London as Crypto Criminal Activity Surges","A disturbing robbery in London and a major sentencing in Boston this week have drawn attention to the expanding threat landscape surrounding cryptocurrency. In the UK, an American tourist was reportedly drugged with a powerful sedative and robbed of $123,000 in Bitcoin after mistaking a fake taxi driver for his Uber ride. The attacker fled with the victim’s smartphone, which held the private keys to his crypto wallet. Just days earlier in the United States, a Massachusetts man was sentenced to six years in federal prison for running a covert Bitcoin exchange masked as a vending machine company, laundering over $1 million in cash linked to scams and drug deals. Crypto Crime Wave Reaches London: American Tourist Drugged and Robbed of $123K in Bitcoin In a chilling reminder of the real-world risks tied to digital assets, an American tourist visiting the United Kingdom fell victim to a crypto-targeted mugging that left him without $123,000 in Bitcoin. The victim, identified as Jacob Irwin-Cline, recounted the traumatic ordeal to My London, revealing a sophisticated scheme involving impersonation, drugging, and digital theft. The incident began after Cline spent an evening at a bar in London. Slightly intoxicated, he ordered an Uber to take him back to his accommodation. However, instead of verifying the license plate or vehicle description, he mistakenly entered a different car driven by a man who resembled the expected Uber driver but was operating a private, unregistered vehicle. Jacob Irwin-Cline (Source: My London) What followed was a disturbing sequence of events that has raised alarm bells in both the tourism and crypto communities. According to Cline, the impersonating driver offered him a cigarette shortly after entering the vehicle. The seemingly innocent gesture turned dangerous when Cline began to feel overwhelmingly drowsy. Within minutes, Cline lost consciousness for what he estimates was approximately half an hour. By the time he regained awareness, the situation had spiraled out of control. The driver demanded that he exit the car. As Cline stepped out, the vehicle abruptly accelerated, clipping him in the process and fleeing the scene with his smartphone. The phone was not just a communication device, it also contained access to Cline’s Bitcoin wallet. His private keys, stored on the device without additional cold storage backups or multi-factor authentication, gave the thief immediate access to the $123,000 in crypto assets. Cline’s case is not isolated. It comes amid a troubling wave of violent incidents targeting crypto investors, executives, and their families. Criminals appear to be evolving their methods to exploit the growing number of individuals with significant digital holdings. Earlier this month in France, the father of a crypto exchange owner was rescued from captivity by French police, who uncovered an organized ransom operation. The unidentified exchange executive’s family was reportedly being targeted for the crypto ransom, and law enforcement intervention was critical in preventing a potentially tragic outcome. Just days later, Pierre Noizat, CEO of Paris-based crypto exchange Paymium, confirmed that his daughter and grandson were victims of an attempted kidnapping in broad daylight. The assailants, masked and coordinated, tried to force the family into a nearby vehicle before being repelled by the daughter and another individual on-site. These events have put pressure on governments, exchanges, and the broader crypto ecosystem to rethink security standards—both digital and physical. A Call for Better Personal Security With the line between virtual wealth and real-world vulnerability continuing to blur, experts are urging individuals with substantial crypto holdings to implement stronger operational security (OpSec) protocols. This includes storing private keys in cold wallets, using multi-signature access, and avoiding sharing wealth-related information in public forums or social settings. The UK incident also raises questions about platform accountability. Ride-sharing companies like Uber have invested in safety features such as license plate verification and driver identity checks. However, this incident illustrates the dangers of noncompliance on the user side, especially when impaired or distracted. London’s Metropolitan Police have yet to make a public statement about Cline’s case but are reportedly investigating the theft. Authorities have urged tourists and residents to remain vigilant, particularly when accessing high-value accounts on mobile devices while traveling. Meanwhile, crypto platforms are being encouraged to enforce stronger security measures, including default 2FA (two-factor authentication) and enhanced alerts when access from a new device is detected. Crypto Wealth is No Longer Anonymous Cline’s experience sheds light on the hard truth that crypto wealth, once considered pseudonymous and secure, can now make individuals a high-profile target in both the digital and physical world. Social media posts, exchange account leaks, and even blockchain explorer data can hint at wallet balances and attract malicious actors. As of this writing, Cline’s stolen Bitcoin has not been recovered. Blockchain forensic firms have been contacted to trace the funds, but analysts warn that once a phone is compromised and access keys are exported or transferred, real-time recovery becomes increasingly difficult. Massachusetts Man Sentenced to 6 Years for Operating Covert Bitcoin Exchange Disguised as Vending Business In other crypto crime news, a US man accused of running a clandestine Bitcoin exchange under the guise of a vending machine business has been sentenced to six years in federal prison, capping a years-long investigation into what prosecutors called a “no questions asked” crypto conversion service that facilitated drug deals and scams. Trung Nguyen, a resident of Danvers, Massachusetts, was sentenced by US District Court Judge Richard Stearns in a Boston courtroom on May 22. In addition to the prison term, Nguyen will serve three years of supervised release and must forfeit $1.5 million in illegal proceeds. Nguyen’s business, which operated under the name National Vending, processed more than $1 million in cash-for- Bitcoin transactions between September 2017 and October 2020, according to prosecutors. But beneath the surface, the business was anything but ordinary vending operations. Prosecutors say Trung Nguyen operated a fake vending machine business. (Source: Pacer ) Authorities revealed that Nguyen took part in an online course designed to teach individuals how to evade banking scrutiny and regulatory detection. These lessons included tips on avoiding words like “Bitcoin” in business paperwork, creating fictional supplier lists, and camouflaging illicit financial flows through legitimate-sounding fronts. According to federal filings, Nguyen’s services attracted a diverse and questionable clientele. Among them were victims of overseas romance and tech scams, who were coerced into converting cash into Bitcoin on behalf of fraudsters. In one particularly damning example, Nguyen facilitated ten transactions totaling $250,000 for a known drug dealer in 2018. At the heart of the prosecution was Nguyen’s decision to run a money-transmitting business without registering with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which is a requirement under federal anti-money laundering (AML) laws. Prosecutors alleged that Nguyen willfully ignored AML rules, failing to file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) or Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs) even when processing large sums of cash exceeding $10,000—transactions that would typically be red-flagged by compliant financial institutions. Instead, Nguyen structured deposits by breaking up large cash sums into smaller amounts spread across multiple days and different bank branches, which is a tactic commonly known as “smurfing,” that is used to avoid triggering regulatory alerts. Sting Operation and Conviction Nguyen’s downfall came via a sting operation in which undercover law enforcement officers posed as clients. During several meetings, Nguyen accepted bundles of cash and returned Bitcoin while charging a commission of around 5%. He communicated through encrypted messaging platforms and reportedly used advanced privacy technologies to obscure transaction trails on the blockchain. Despite initially pleading not guilty in June 2023, Nguyen was convicted in November 2024 on one count of operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business and one count of money laundering. He was acquitted on a second money laundering charge. National Vending: A Case Study in Modern Financial Deception National Vending functioned for three years without detection by disguising its true nature. Banks processed Nguyen’s structured deposits under the assumption that they were revenue from vending operations. Crypto exchanges received fiat deposits that Nguyen claimed were business expenses. In reality, authorities said, Nguyen was functioning as a shadow exchange and turning hard cash into untraceable cryptocurrency for anyone willing to pay his commission and ask no questions. With Nguyen’s sentencing, regulators may further accelerate crackdowns on peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto exchangers and unlicensed brokers. Legal experts believe that authorities could increase enforcement actions in the coming year by leveraging blockchain analysis tools and undercover agents. While centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken have long operated under regulatory oversight, decentralized and informal conversion services continue to operate in legal gray zones. Nguyen’s prosecution signals that such loopholes are closing.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9235/tourist-loses-123-k-in-bitcoin-in-london-as-crypto-criminal-activity-surges,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

With this, the Ethereum market cap surged above $327 billion and surpassed the market cap of Bank of America for a while. With this, the ETH price is heading towards one of the most bullish monthly closes in the near future. Moreover, the current chart patterns are replicating the Bitcoin 2021 bull run, and hence, if it follows a similar outcome, the ETH price may find highs beyond a 5-digit figure. Following the Pectra upgrade, ETH/BTC has shown huge bullish momentum, rebounding from the key support levels at 0.02. This occurred back in 2020, before the start of the 2021 bull run. This could be the main reason that the 40x Long Whale, James Wynn , opened a long position with 25x leverage in ETH at the entry point of $2666, valued at $60.4 million. Previously, the whale had opened a long position in Bitcoin, which resulted in a massive upswing towards new highs. This suggests that whales have become extremely bullish on Ethereum, indicating that the price of ETH could be poised for a significant upswing. After facing equal bullish and bearish action throughout the past week, the ETH price has finally triggered a strong breakout, which could push the price beyond the multi-year ascending trend line. Moreover, the weekly price action suggests the token is testing the 200-day MA, and a rise above the range could be the turning point for the second-largest token. Currently, the price is testing the neckline of the v-shaped recovery and hence a weekly close above $2,619 may ascertain the beginning of the fresh bullish action. The weekly RSI is rising, the weekly MACD underwent a bullish crossover, and the weekly CMF is at 0 after a rebound from -0.11, but the weekly DMI displays a diverse movement. On the other hand, the Ethereum Open Interest has surged above $33 billion, suggesting a significant rise in the open futures and option contracts, which signals fresh liquidity entering the space. After Bitcoin, it’s now time for Ethereum to break the highs, which may further trigger a strong altseason as Bitcoin dominance continues to drop.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/ethereum-open-interest-hits-new-highs-heres-why-eth-price-is-poised-for-a-50-surge/,"BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX","Price Analysis|Ethereum",cryptocompare

Bitcoin ( BTC ) futures open interest reached a peak of just over $80 billion on May 23, according to CoinGlass. It’s an increase of 30% since the start of May as derivatives speculators load up on leverage in anticipation of higher Bitcoin prices. Open interest is the total number of outstanding futures contracts that allow traders to bet on the future price of Bitcoin, which have not been settled or closed, showing the total amount of current market speculation. Total Bitcoin futures OI. Source: Coinglass When OI surges, it indicates massive leveraged positions are built up in the market, with lots of traders holding large positions with borrowed money. If Bitcoin’s price moves against these over-leveraged positions, traders get forcibly liquidated, and the flushout can create selling pressure on Bitcoin, which can cause a rapid drop in prices and high volatility. However, analysts suggest the surge in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows, which have seen more than $2.5 billion this week, can counter some of that extended leverage. Related: Crypto perp futures coming ‘very soon,’ says CFTC’s Mersinger Bitcoin options markets show a similar pattern with open interest over $1.5 billion at the $110,000 and $120,000 strike prices on the Deribit exchange. There is also more than $1 billion in OI at strike prices of $115,000, $125,000, and $130,000. Around $2.76 billion worth of notional value contracts are due to expire on May 23 with a put/call ratio of 1.2%, meaning there are more short (put) sellers than longs (call), and a max pain point of $103,000, where most losses will be made on expiry, according to Deribit.

According to The Independent and Bloomberg , protesters held signs reading “America is not for sale” and “Stop Crypto Corruption” while chanting “Shame!” as attendees emerged from their cars near the club’s security checkpoint. Some shouted, “I hope you choke on your dinner,” while others carried props, including a gold coin with Trump’s face and placards demanding the guest list be made public.

Access to the event was based on a leaderboard. It tracked token holdings over a three-week period. As a result, the top 25 investors received additional privileges. These included a private cocktail reception with Trump earlier in the evening. Bloomberg reported that the dinner hall featured signs that read “Fight Fight Fight.” These referenced the company behind the meme coin. Additionally, guests received gift bags with branded hats and plaques. Meanwhile, the menu included salad, filet mignon, pan-seared halibut, and warm lava cake. The guest list featured several public figures. These included former NBA player Lamar Odom and crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun . Notably, Sun is currently resolving a regulatory case in the US. He posted a photo of himself on the way to the dinner on X. Trump also promoted the evening on Truth Social, claiming, “The U.S.A. is DOMINATING in Crypto, Bitcoin, etc., and we are going to keep it that way!” Warren Decries Trump Crypto Gathering as Corrupt and Ethically Fraught The event has sparked sharp criticism from Democratic lawmakers. Sen. Elizabeth Warren called it “an orgy of corruption ,” pointing to recent policy shifts under the Trump administration. These include the dismantling of the Justice Department’s crypto enforcement unit and changes at the SEC. She and others have warned that such gatherings blur ethical lines and risk selling influence to wealthy individuals, including those outside the US. The White House released a vague schedule showing Trump would stay at the club until around 8:30 p.m. EDT. However, it confirmed the event was closed to the press.

2025-05-23T05:00:10.000Z,"XRP’s 3.3% Weekly Gain Encouraging — Yet MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Explosive Potential Keeps It in Focus","Bitcoin (BTC) continues to anchor the crypto market, trading above $106,000 with forecasts pointing to $116,000–$137,000 by late May 2025. Institutional inflows and ETF adoption remain robust, giving BTC a solid foundation for the next leg up. However, as Bitcoin’s momentum steadies, savvy investors are increasingly rotating capital into altcoins with higher upside—especially early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the risk/reward profile is drawing aggressive capital rotation. This shift is positioning MAGA as a primary beneficiary of the current bull cycle’s capital flow. XRP: Bullish Momentum, But Limited Multiples XRP has climbed 3.3% this week, now trading at $2.35 after surging more than 300% since late 2024 3 . The token’s rally is fueled by regulatory clarity, the launch of CME-regulated XRP futures, and growing speculation around a spot ETF. Analysts are forecasting a move to $2.80–$3.40 by June, with $4.50 as an optimistic scenario for 2025. However, with XRP’s price action now consolidating in a narrow range and some technical indicators flashing caution, many traders are diversifying into early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE to maximize portfolio growth potential. While XRP’s outlook is bullish, the magnitude of its next leg may pale in comparison to what’s possible with MAGA’s explosive setup. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Breakout Presale With 30x–50x Upside MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing the spotlight as 2025’s leading presale, with over $8 million raised and a confirmed listing price of $0.007. The project’s scarcity-driven model, Hashex-audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling unprecedented demand. Analysts are projecting 30x–50x returns for early buyers, and some models suggest a $1 target within 12–18 months—a potential 375,000% gain from the current presale price. With Stage 8 nearly full and a limited-time 50% bonus for early buyers using the promo code MAGA50X , MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the only major altcoin still in true accumulation mode before listings. As capital rotates from established giants to breakout contenders, MAGA’s momentum and asymmetric upside are making it the top altcoin to watch for Q3 2025. Polkadot: Quiet Growth, But MAGA Steals the Show Polkadot (DOT) is holding steady around $7.50, with steady development and ecosystem expansion. While DOT remains a dependable hold for long-term investors, its near-term upside is less dramatic compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. As traders seek sharper returns, MAGA’s early-stage appeal and viral narrative are making it the go-to allocation for those chasing the next 30x–50x winner. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Conclusion XRP’s 3.3% weekly gain is encouraging and Bitcoin’s macro strength is clear, but MAGACOIN FINANCE’s explosive presale potential and 30x–50x analyst forecasts are keeping it firmly in the spotlight. With Stage 8 nearly full, a $0.007 listing target, and a 50% bonus for early buyers using MAGA50X , MAGA offers a rare chance to secure ground-floor exposure before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery.

2025-05-23T04:56:38.000Z,"JPMorgan, BofA, and Wells Fargo Plan Stablecoin Launch Amid Crypto Disruption","The post JPMorgan, BofA, and Wells Fargo Plan Stablecoin Launch Amid Crypto Disruption appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As digital assets continue to reshape global finance, America’s biggest banks are moving to reclaim their role at the forefront. A new report by The Wall Street Journal reveals that JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo are exploring a joint stablecoin initiative, one that could transform traditional banking’s approach to digital money and challenge the dominance of crypto-native platforms. Breaking: @WSJ front page – Big Banks Explore Venturing Into Crypto World Together With Joint #Stablecoin The discussions involve payments companies co-owned by @jpmorgan @Chase . The conversations have so far involved companies co-owned by JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America… pic.twitter.com/HzmS6PsvB8 — MartyParty (@martypartymusic) May 23, 2025 US Banks Push for Regulated Stablecoin Leading US financial institutions are in early talks to develop a stablecoin through two key entities: Early Warning Services (EWS) and The Clearing House (TCH). Both are jointly owned by a consortium of major banks. EWS runs Zelle, the popular peer-to-peer payment network , while TCH powers real-time interbank payments. This initiative signals a significant shift in banking strategy, no longer ignoring the digital asset trend but actively building infrastructure to compete with it. Regulatory Clarity Could Accelerate Stablecoin Development A crucial element for the stablecoin project’s success lies in regulatory clarity. The GENIUS Act, short for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, could become the legal foundation for such initiatives. The bill recently passed a procedural Senate hurdle and, if fully approved, would allow both banks and nonbanks to issue stablecoins under a regulated framework. For the banks, this could mean a clear path to create and distribute dollar-backed digital assets legally and securely, opening the door to broader institutional adoption . JPMorgan and Wells Fargo Lead the Way JPMorgan has already launched its digital dollar, JPM Coin, to move money within its system. Wells Fargo has tested a similar version called Wells Fargo Digital Cash for use in cross-border payments and internal transfers. Meanwhile, Bank of America hasn’t rolled one out yet, but its CEO says they’re ready to go, as soon as the rules allow it. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : U.S. SEC Delays Decision-Making on More Crypto ETFs Led by XRP and Litecoin , Crypto-Native Firms Target Banking Status While traditional banks warm up to blockchain , crypto-native firms like Circle, BitGo, Paxos, and Coinbase also advance toward full-scale banking roles. With President Trump’s return and his pro-crypto stance , promising to make the US a “Bitcoin superpower,” these firms are again finding room to grow after years of regulatory headwinds. Some, like BitGo, are reportedly preparing to apply for bank charters while managing reserves for stablecoins like USD1 , tied to a venture from the Trump family. As big banks turn to blockchain and crypto firms try to go mainstream, stablecoins are becoming the next big thing. If banks launch their digital dollar, it could change how money moves and bring traditional finance closer to crypto. But it all depends on rules, demand, and how fast they can act. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The move comes after a steep breakout on May 20 that took the Bitcoin price above multiple trendline resistances and historical supply zones.

2025-05-23T04:32:04.000Z,"XRP Flashes Bullish Signal After 200 Days, Price Targets $3.33","The post XRP Flashes Bullish Signal After 200 Days, Price Targets $3.33 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The XRP price has flashed a powerful bullish signal after 200 days, and this could be the start of the much-awaited bullish rally. With fresh momentum building, analysts are eyeing a surge toward $3.33 in the short term, with even higher targets going further. Analyst Targets $3.33 Short Term Analyst Dark Defender , in his latest analysis, has observed that XRP has flashed a rare Golden Cross signal on the weekly RSI. This could launch XRP toward $3.33 soon, with a higher target set at $5.85. These targets are part of a bigger bullish trend that is expected to unfold soon. As Bitcoin continues to make new all-time highs, Investor Paul Barron believes that the rising wave could lift XRP as well, which could target $4 next. XRP Forms First Golden Cross vs. Bitcoin in 4 Years XRP recently formed a golden cross against Bitcoin on the weekly chart for the first time in four years. This happens when the 50-week moving average crosses above the 200-week moving average, which hints at a possible bull run against XRP after staying flat for four years. XRP is building pressure for a big move, followed by a sharp breakout in either direction. With RSI near 60, it has plenty of room for upside movements. On the upside, its targets include $2.68, $2.95, and $3.39, with $3.87. But if it loses support at $2.30, then it could slide back to $2.26 or $2.10, losing its long-term support zone. Bullish Technical Indicators with Some Mixed Signals XRP’s technical indicators show mixed signals but are mostly positive. MACD shows some selling pressure while the RSI is neutral at 58. Major moving averages from 10-200 periods show strong buy momentum and an overall bullish trend. It is currently trading at $2.47, up over 2% in the past day. Recent reports from Messari point that XRP is showing strong growth, with its market cap up 2% this quarter, while BTC, ETH, and SOL dropped 22%. Year-over-year, XRP’s market cap climbed by 252%. Network activity is booming too, as daily active addresses jumped 142% and new addresses rose 210% compared to last year.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-flashes-bullish-signal-after-200-days-price-targets-3-33/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare
2025-05-23T04:30:58.000Z,"Dogecoin Price Roadmap To $5: These 5 Bullish Factors Lead The Way","The Dogecoin price is gaining renewed attention as a crypto analyst outlines a potential roadmap toward a bullish $5 target . Backed by technical chart patterns and bullish signals, the analyst has unveiled five factors that are emerging as critical drivers in DOGE’s projected upward trajectory. Technical Indicators Point To Dogecoin Price Rally A recent technical analysis on Dogecoin’s monthly chart by Bitcoin Galaxy on TradingView forecasts that a massive rally could be on the horizon — one that would propel DOGE from its current price of $0.24 to $5. The chart analysis reveals five compelling bullish signals that could set the stage for this meteoric price increase. A deep dive into the monthly time frame shows that Dogecoin is potentially repeating the same setup that led to its historic 2021 surge . First, the 20-month and 50-month Moving Averages (MA50 and MA20) have acted as solid support, just as they performed before during the last bull run. Dogecoin’s price recently rebounded from this support zone, mirroring the early stages of the previous bull cycle . Another signal highlighted by the analyst is the Relative Strength Index (RSI) . Currently, DOGE’s RSI remains relatively low on the monthly chart but is showing a potential for upward movement. In previous cycles, the RSI rose around the 80 level before a blow-off top. With ample room to grow toward 80% currently, Dogecoin’s momentum could be building for another price rally. Bitcoin Galaxy’s chart also shows that Dogecoin has long held a critical support level despite market turbulence, showing strength and resilience. The last time this support was tested and held, the meme coin experienced a price increase of approximately 20,399%. The timeline of Dogecoin’s highlighted bullish structure may also be aligning. The previous bull rally took about six months (181 days) to reach its peak, roughly around $0.477 in 2021, from a similar technical setup. If the same pattern unfolds, the chart suggests October 2025 could mark a significant price climax. This timeline places June and July in a critical window, which the analyst suggests could see strong bullish action and likely trigger the start or middle of DOGE’s projected rally phase. With these signals aligned, Bitcoin Galaxy believes that Dogecoin is set for a surge to $5, representing a 1,983% increase from its current market price. $0.74 Resistance Key To DOGE Breakout Notably, Bitcoin Galaxy highlights the $0.74 level as a critical resistance for Dogecoin . A breakout above this threshold could validate this analyst’s bullish roadmap toward the $4 – $5 target. Looking at the chart, the resistance level aligns with the upper boundary of an ascending parallel channel that contains DOGE’s price movements from mid-2022 to date. This channel often signals healthy upward momentum as long as the price stays within its boundaries.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-roadmap-to-5/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Dogecoin|50-Month MA|Ascending Parallel Channel|Bitcoin Galaxy|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|moving average|relative strength index|RSI",cryptocompare
2025-05-23T04:30:24.000Z,"Ethereum’s 4.5% Increase Highlights Market Optimism — MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Presale Success Suggests Massive Upside","Ethereum’s recent 4.5% price increase is fueling optimism across the crypto landscape, with whales accumulating and analysts pointing to further upside as network upgrades and ETF speculation build. Yet, while ETH’s rise is impressive, the real story of 2025 is the explosive momentum behind MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale—where analysts are projecting up to 35x–50x returns, and some models even suggest a $1 target by year-end. As Bitcoin and XRP consolidate and Injective gains traction, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the top early-stage opportunity for those seeking exponential gains this cycle. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Powerhouse With 35x–50x Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is dominating 2025’s presale charts, with over $8 million raised and its price still under $0.001 as Stage 8 nears completion. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, scarcity-driven tokenomics, and HashEx-audited contracts are fueling unprecedented demand, with analysts forecasting 35x–50x returns as conservative, and some models projecting up to 18,500% upside if momentum continues. MAGA’s political meme narrative and viral community engagement have made it the #1 presale of the year, outpacing even the most established tokens in terms of investor enthusiasm and momentum. With a $0.007 listing target on the horizon and a limited-time 50% bonus for early buyers using the promo code PATRIOT50X , MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the only major altcoin still in true accumulation mode before listings—offering the highest risk-adjusted upside window heading into Q3. Ethereum: Whale Accumulation and Bullish Catalysts Ethereum (ETH) has climbed 4.5% in recent weeks, trading near $2,489 and showing renewed strength as whales accumulate millions of tokens in anticipation of network upgrades and a proposed 100x gas limit increase. Analysts expect that if historical trends repeat, ETH could surge toward $2,300–$2,700 in the near term, with the EIP 9698 proposal and ETF speculation providing additional bullish catalysts. While Ethereum remains the backbone of DeFi and Web3, its size and maturity mean that the most aggressive capital is now rotating into earlier-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the risk/reward profile is far more compelling for those seeking transformative returns. XRP: Institutional Momentum, But MAGA Steals the Spotlight XRP is trading between $2.33 and $2.65, with whale accumulation and regulatory clarity supporting its price. Analysts forecast a move to $5.50 by December 2025 and $10–$20 by 2030 if global adoption and ETF approvals accelerate. While XRP’s upside is steady, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s early-stage momentum and 35x–50x growth model are attracting traders seeking faster, higher-multiple returns before listings go live. Bitcoin and Injective: Solid Foundations, But Capital Rotates Bitcoin (BTC) is consolidating above $110,000, providing a strong macro anchor for the market, while Injective (INJ) continues to build in the DeFi space. However, as capital rotates for higher multiples, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale structure and viral narrative are making it the go-to allocation for those chasing the next 25x–50x winner. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW Conclusion Ethereum’s 4.5% gain is a clear sign of market optimism, but the most compelling opportunity of 2025 may be MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 nearly full, a locked-in $0.007 listing target, and a 50% bonus for early buyers using PATRIOT50X , MAGA offers a rare ground-floor entry before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery.

2025-05-23T04:01:39.000Z,"Ethereum Price Could Surge to $3,200 as CME Futures Gaps Remain Unfilled","Ethereum (ETH) is showing strong momentum amid rising trading volumes, bullish community sentiment, and technical patterns hinting at a potential breakout to $3,200. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has been on a tear lately, climbing 5.6% in the last 24 hours to reach $2,666, with a 30-day gain of more than 64%. This surge has reignited discussion around key price targets, particularly two unfilled CME futures gaps near the $3,200 mark. CME Gaps and the $3,200 Target According to pseudonymous crypto trader Titan of Crypto, such gaps “tend to get filled,” implying ETH’s rally might be far from over. The technical rationale behind his claim finds support in historical price behavior, where such voids often act as a magnet for future price action. These differences are usually created when the market starts a new week significantly higher than it closed the previous week. Ethereum, which is currently riding a wave of bullish momentum, appears to be targeting these levels next, provided it can overcome key resistance zones. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe weighed in on May 22, noting that the crypto asset recently cleared the $2,400 resistance zone. “I assume that Ethereum is following Bitcoin and will break to $3,000+,” he said, highlighting the correlation between the two. Nonetheless, some market watchers are arguing caution. As CryptoPotato recently reported, ETH has entered an “ overheated state ” following intense trading activity and profit-taking near $2,600. According to on-chain data from CryptoQuant, the altcoin may face a short-term cooling period before resuming its upward trajectory. Despite the potential pause, there is still strong long-term conviction, with Santiment data showing less than 5% of ETH is now held on centralized exchanges, the lowest level in more than 10 years. Additionally, last week, investment products linked to the token saw inflows worth $205 million , signaling renewed institutional confidence following the Pectra upgrade. Altcoin Season on the Horizon? Meanwhile, the crypto community is buzzing, with YouTuber Crypto Rover linking Ethereum’s latest uptick to an impending altcoin season. Chris Burniske, who formerly headed ARK Invest’s crypto division, also pointed to ETH’s strength against BTC as a trigger for alt rallies. The cryptocurrency’s recent performance shows a 37.4% gain over 14 days, accompanied by a 64% surge in the past month, which still leaves it more than 29% below its all-time high. According to digital asset investor Daan Crypto Trades, Ethereum’s next critical resistance is at $2,850, a level that, if broken, could pave the way for the $3,200 CME gap fill predicted by Titan of Crypto.

2025-05-23T03:50:39.000Z,"Best crypto to buy as BTC closes out Bitcoin Pizza Day with a bang","Bitcoin (BTC) surged to a new all-time high on Thursday, trading above $111,000 for the first time ever as the crypto community celebrated Bitcoin Pizza Day — the anniversary of the first real-world Bitcoin transaction. The milestone marks a decisive breakout, putting the original cryptocurrency in price discovery mode amid a shifting macroeconomic backdrop. At the time of writing on Friday, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap continued to stay above the $111K mark. Bitcoin continues to serve as the bedrock of the crypto market and a store of value during times of economic instability. However, its reduced price swings and rising acceptance among institutional players have made it less compelling for those chasing high-risk, high-reward opportunities. This shift has pushed more adventurous investors toward newer, high-upside tokens like Bitcoin Pepe , which offer greater exposure to speculative momentum. As overall market sentiment turns more optimistic, these early-stage assets are likely to see amplified gains from returning risk capital. BTC shows its metal The rally comes as traditional financial markets face renewed uncertainty. The 30-year US Treasury yield topped 5% this week following Moody’s downgrade of the US sovereign debt rating. Meanwhile, a proposed tax bill in Congress could significantly widen the federal deficit, stoking investor fears over long-term fiscal stability. Bitcoin’s recent price action underscores its evolving role in investor portfolios. The cryptocurrency has increasingly decoupled from equity markets, with BTC soaring even as the S&P 500 fell on Thursday. Bitcoin is now up 18% year-to-date, decisively outperforming major US equities. Gold, the traditional safe haven, has also notched new all-time highs and is rebounding after a brief pullback. Still, Bitcoin’s ascent is drawing particular attention from both retail and institutional investors who increasingly view it as a hedge against macro risk and a diversifier in multi-asset portfolios. The bullish momentum has revived long-term price forecasts. Geoff Kendrick, Head of Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered, issued a note on Tuesday projecting that Bitcoin could reach $500,000 by 2029. That target, once the domain of crypto maximalists, is now being echoed by mainstream analysts as digital assets gain broader acceptance. Why Bitcoin Pepe is poised to benefit Bitcoin’s renewed surge is once again fueling a broader crypto rally, echoing past cycles where capital rotation lifted the entire digital asset landscape. This latest wave of liquidity is reviving interest in speculative plays, especially meme coins. At the center of this resurgence is Bitcoin Pepe, a project that fuses the viral appeal of meme culture with the technical underpinnings of next-generation infrastructure. As the first meme-focused Layer 2 built on Bitcoin, it leverages the network’s robust security while adopting a high-speed, Solana-like framework to scale effectively. The project is moving quickly to expand its ecosystem. These include a partnership with Super Meme for secure meme coin launches via PEP-20. The project is also collaborating with Plena Finance to explore integrating BPEP into mobile-first DeFi. The project also joins hands with GETE Network to potentially bring BPEP into cross-chain Web3 gaming. These alliances not only deepen Bitcoin Pepe’s technical stack but also extend its relevance beyond meme-driven speculation. Investor appetite is already evident— Bitcoin Pepe ’s ongoing presale has attracted over $11 million. Priced at $0.0359, the presale runs through May 31, 2025. An exchange listing is anticipated soon after, potentially unlocking near-term momentum as the market reacts to the debut of this meme-layer infrastructure token.

2025-05-23T03:40:33.000Z,"AI and Mining Data Centers Convergence","HodlX Guest Post Submit Your Post In recent months, AI (artificial intelligence) workloads have gone from theoretical benchmarks to real-time economic pressure on global infrastructure. From language models serving millions of queries per hour to diffusion models requiring vast GPU clusters for inference, the strain on power grids and compute resources is accelerating. Surprisingly, the infrastructure best positioned to absorb this load isn’t housed in Silicon Valley or hyperscale server farms – but in mining data centers. From PoW (proof-of-work) to generative AI Cryptocurrency mining centers were built on the premise of high-density, power-intensive computation – optimized for efficiency, uptime and thermal control. These are the same foundations required for modern AI. But there’s a critical difference – while mining processes are relatively bursty and can be interrupted without business loss, AI workloads are sustained, precision-driven and delay-sensitive. This contrast presents an opportunity . By upgrading cooling systems – particularly through immersion and liquid-based technologies – and optimizing power distribution infrastructure, mining data centers can become hybrid environments. They can run crypto mining when energy costs are low and switch to AI inference jobs when GPU demand spikes. Emerging orchestration platforms, combined with AI-specific scheduling tools, allow dynamic switching between tasks. These tools have demonstrated up to 27 to 33% improvement in job completion times and 1.53x reductions in queuing delays. The economic layer is equally compelling – if AI demand is monetized through inference marketplaces, mining operations may find it more profitable to rent compute power than to mine certain assets. Some mining centers already experiment with FPGA-based setups, which are ASIC-resistant and natively suitable for AI training . This opens the door to full interoperability – where the same infrastructure processes both PoW blocks and transformer models , depending on market conditions. When scale becomes a liability Despite its early lead in AI investment, the US faces a looming infrastructure wall. In Virginia , data centers consume more than 25% of the state’s electricity. In Santa Clara, over 50 data centers now draw 60% of the city’s total power usage, forcing Silicon Valley Power to drastically expand its transmission systems – raising rates for both industrial and residential users. Numerous research show that global electricity demand could more than triple by 2030, largely due to AI . If these projections hold, the US will need not just additional power but smarter load balancing strategies – which traditional hyperscale AI facilities, tied to rigid uptime SLAs, are poorly suited for. To meet this soaring demand, the US must rapidly diversify its energy sources. Scaling up renewables – including utility-scale solar, wind and hydropower – will play a critical role. Yet these sources are inherently intermittent, creating volatility on the grid. This is where mining data centers offer a surprising stabilizing advantage. Designed with demand-flexible architecture, they can pause or throttle operations based on grid load, absorbing excess generation during peak renewable output and scaling down during low-production periods. In Texas, this flexibility has already led to collaborative load-shedding agreements between mining operations and grid operators, positioning these facilities as extremely valuable in next-generation power management. Alternative strategies are also emerging. Electricity imports from Canada , especially through HVDC (high-voltage direct current) lines tapping into hydroelectric power, are under active exploration . On the domestic front, SMRs (small modular reactors) represent a promising path. Developed by several firms and already approved by US regulators, SMRs offer safe, decentralized nuclear power – ideal for pairing with regional AI hubs and compute-heavy facilities . The next AI frontier Bitcoin mining has acted as the early mover in this trend. Yet the real story isn’t just about mining – it’s about what comes next. Mining infrastructure is paving the way for AI to compute at scale. These facilities are testing grounds – where local talent is trained, operational processes are refined and regulatory pathways are explored. With modest hardware upgrades and improved connectivity, many mining centers could pivot to support AI workloads, offering a low-latency, cost-efficient backbone for global model inference. The door to full interoperability What’s needed is a reframing of what data center infrastructure should look like in the AI era. Rather than defaulting to hyperscalers, the future may be modular, flexible and geographically distributed, led by hybrid centers that know how to manage thermal loads, optimize for cost per watt and shift operational models in real time. Batyr is the founder and CEO of Uminers , a full-cycle mining infrastructure provider. He has deep background in data center development, cryptocurrency mining and AI-driven technologies.

2025-05-23T03:00:53.000Z,"Could It Be 15,000%? MAGACOIN FINANCE, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Are Now Entering Analyst Bull Zones","As the summer of 2025 heats up, analysts are zeroing in on a handful of tokens that could deliver life-changing returns. While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the market’s foundational assets, it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that’s rapidly moving from under-the-radar presale to headline contender. With capital rotation intensifying and early-stage momentum building, some experts are now projecting that MAGA, ETH, and BTC could be the next big winners—potentially offering up to 15,000% upside this cycle. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Acceleration and 15,000% Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing major attention in 2025, with over $8 million raised and its presale price still under $0.001. Analysts are projecting up to 18,500% potential returns, with some calling a $1 target by year-end “not out of reach” if current momentum continues. MAGA’s capped supply of 100 billion tokens (45% in presale), audited smart contracts, and political meme appeal are driving rapid community growth and early-stage investor participation. As Stage 8 nears completion and the $0.007 listing target approaches, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being positioned as a rare ground-floor opportunity—one that could rival the early days of SHIBA INU or DOGE, but with a more transparent structure and scarcity-driven upside. Analysts say a 35x surge looks conservative, with 50x or even 150x possible if current trends continue. In pure numbers, even a modest $500 position could scale to $17,000–$25,000 based on prevailing models. For those seeking the next supercycle winner, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the name on every smart investor’s radar. Ethereum: Bullish Structure and 2025 Breakout Forecast Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,621, up 2.8% on the day and showing renewed strength as whales accumulate and network upgrades gather steam. Technical analysis points to possible resistance at $2,853, $3,023, and $3,222, with the 50-day moving average supporting a bullish edge. Looking ahead, DigitalCoinPrice predicts a strong 2025 for ETH, with price targets as high as $5,715 by year-end and new all-time highs above $4,800. As Ethereum’s layer-2 adoption and ecosystem expansion continue, the platform’s role as a store of value and utility token is only strengthening, making it a core holding for those seeking both stability and upside. Bitcoin: Market Anchor, But Capital Rotates to High-Upside Plays Bitcoin (BTC) is holding above $103,000, with May price predictions between $110,000–$115,000 as institutional interest remains strong. While BTC’s dominance is clear, the biggest near-term upside is shifting toward more nimble early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the risk/reward profile is far more attractive. As Bitcoin’s price stabilizes, capital is increasingly rotating into high-upside altcoins like MAGA, where early-stage entries offer the potential for exponential returns before public hype catches on. XRP and HBAR: Steady Growth, But MAGA Steals the Spotlight XRP is trading at $2.36, with analysts watching closely as futures and ETF optimism fuel renewed interest. While XRP’s infrastructure and legal clarity are positives, the most dramatic growth potential may now be shifting toward early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the window for exponential returns remains open. HBAR continues to build through enterprise integrations and real-world use cases, but its near-term upside is less dramatic compared to the explosive potential of MAGA. EARLY ACCESS ENDING SOON – ACT NOW Conclusion As analysts watch closely for the next 15,000% crypto winner, MAGACOIN FINANCE, Ethereum, and Bitcoin are all entering the bull zone for 2025. With MAGA’s presale nearly complete, a $0.007 listing target, and projections as high as 18,500% ROI, the early-stage window is closing fast. For investors seeking the next big crypto success story, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the breakout contender that could define this cycle’s upside.

Bitcoin Realized Cap Data Shows Recent Movements From 10+ Years BTC Bitcoin has managed to achieve a new all-time high (ATH), but it’s not the only thing cryptocurrency community members are celebrating today. Back on May 22nd, 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz exchanged 10,000 BTC for two pizzas, in what was perhaps the first example of the asset being used as a mode of payment in a real-world purchase. Given the significance of this event, the date has come to be celebrated as “Bitcoin Pizza Day.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Out Of Bull Pennant—What’s The Target? The pizzas that Laszlo purchased were worth around $40. Fifteen years on, the same amount of BTC translates to a whopping $1.1 billion. Here’s a chart shared by the analytics firm CryptoQuant that shows how this figure has looked on every Bitcoin Pizza Day in history: Naturally, no one could have possibly foreseen just how big Bitcoin would eventually become. But even if they did, transactions like these were probably necessary in bringing the asset to where it’s at today. As CryptoQuant says, “It’s a high price, but it’s the price that was paid to turn Bitcoin into a means of payment.” That said, while many like Laszlo would have actively spent their BTC, some holders didn’t. Whether that’s by accident or a product of willful HODLing is impossible to say for sure, but a chunk of the supply is now aged more than ten years old, meaning the owners of those coins haven’t involved them in a single transaction since then. The analytics firm Glassnode has shared the data for the Realized Cap share of this specific part of the Bitcoin circulating supply. Looks like the value of the metric has seen a notable decline recently | Source: Glassnode on X The Realized Cap basically tells us about the total amount of capital that the Bitcoin investors as a whole have used to purchase their coins. In the chart, the percentage of this metric occupied by the supply aged more than ten years is displayed. Last year, this value hit a peak at 0.045%. Today, the indicator has come to just 0.033%, following steep drawdowns between December and February, and another since April 20th. Based on the trend, Glassnode notes, “15 years after Laszlo bought pizza for 10,000 $BTC – now worth over $1.1B – some of that era’s coins are still moving.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Sets New ATH, But This Metric Says No Overheating Yet Coins that are this old are more likely to have reached that age by being lost than through HODLing conviction, so it’s possible that the old Bitcoin being moved now was just recently rediscovered, either by the original investor or someone else who happened to come across the forgotten wallet keys. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $111,400, up over 7% in the last seven days.

2025-05-23T02:54:27.000Z,"Pi Network Alert: 102M Pi Moved Off OKX, What’s Coming?","The post Pi Network Alert: 102M Pi Moved Off OKX, What’s Coming? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Pi Coin’s price has slipped by more than 3%, currently trading around $0.81. The token recently spiked to $1.60 before quickly pulling back — a move that stirred debate in the crypto community, with some raising concerns about manipulation. At the moment, Pi is holding a crucial support at $0.79, while resistance remains in the $0.99 to $1.20 range. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is hovering near 52, putting the token on the edge of oversold territory — which could tempt bulls looking for a possible entry. Pi Coin is currently 72% down from its ATH of $2.98. Over 102.7 Million Pi Withdrawn from OKX in Just 3 Days In the midst of the price dip, something big is happening under the surface. Crypto analyst Mr. Spock reported that in the past three days alone, a staggering 102,776,657.17 Pi (π) has been withdrawn from OKX, one of the world’s leading crypto exchanges. That’s over 102.7 million Pi coins, potentially worth tens of millions of dollars, now moving on-chain, live, and verified. And these aren’t small transactions — with some single withdrawals topping 70 million Pi. A New Phase for Pi Coin? Mr. Spock said that this marks a turning point for Pi Coin, which has long faced skepticism over whether it would ever achieve meaningful liquidity or utility. “While doubters watched from the sidelines, true Pioneers kept mining, building, and believing — and now, the results are beginning to show,” he said. With Pi now demonstrating large-scale withdrawals, on-chain activity, and practical blockchain functionality, it seems the project is entering a new phase of real-world traction. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pi Network Faces Centralization Power as Vietnam Dominates Its Node Activity , Call for Transparency In May 2025, Pi Network saw unusual migration activity, with 7 million Pi moved in just 24 hours across nearly 19,500 user accounts. Migrations continued overnight, hinting at increased automation. However, concerns have been raised about large transfers from the Pi liquidity reserve wallet to exchanges like OKX and MEXC. While allowed under Pi’s tokenomics, these actions haven’t been clearly communicated. The community is now calling on the Pi Core Team to be more transparent and release regular reports to maintain trust as the network moves forward. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-23T02:38:39.000Z,"‘No questions asked’ Bitcoin launderer gets 6 years in prison","A US man operating what prosecutors called a “no questions asked” cash-to-Bitcoin conversion service has been sentenced to six years behind bars and was ordered to hand over millions of dollars. Boston federal court Judge Richard Stearns sentenced Trung Nguyen, from Danvers, Massachusetts, to six years in prison followed by three years of supervised release, and ordered him to forfeit $1.5 million, the Boston US Attorney’s Office said on May 22. Prosecutors said Nguyen ran an unlicensed money-transmitting business called National Vending between September 2017 and October 2020, which used various techniques he learned in an online course to evade authorities. As part of the course, Nguyen was taught how to conceal his actual business from banks, crypto exchanges and state authorities by masquerading as a vending machine company that accepted cash deposits, had a list of fictional suppliers, and generally avoided using the phrase “Bitcoin” where possible. Prosecutors say Trung Nguyen operated a fake vending machine business to obscure the cash deposits he was receiving. Source: Pacer According to prosecutors, among Nguyen’s customer base were several scam victims who were tricked into converting cash into Bitcoin ( BTC ) by con artists overseas, as well as a drug dealer who sent $250,000 in cash across 10 transactions in 2018. The Justice Department said Nguyen converted more than $1 million to Bitcoin and “purposely failed” to register with the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) despite being required to do so under federal Anti-Money Laundering regulations. Nguyen also “failed to file Suspicious Activity Reports or Currency Transaction Reports on any of these transactions, including cash transactions of more than $10,000,” according to prosecutors. Undercover cops sting Nguyen Nguyen would often meet his clients in person to accept large sums of cash, which is how he was caught, prosecutors said. A May 2023 indictment said that during several meetings with undercover law enforcement officers, he accepted cash and sent Bitcoin in return, taking just over 5% in commission. Related: Crypto use in money laundering ‘far below’ cash — US Treasury The indictment said Nguyen used encrypted messaging apps and “technologies that made it more difficult” to trace his Bitcoin transactions and broke up the cash deposits into smaller sums over consecutive days and at different branches of the same bank to evade notice by authorities. Nguyen was charged with operating an unlicensed money transmitting business and two counts of money laundering. He pleaded not guilty to all charges in June 2023. A jury convicted him in November on the unlicensed money-transmitting business charge and on just one of the money laundering charges, finding him not guilty of a separate money laundering charge.

2025-05-23T02:03:46.000Z,"XRP Price Prediction For May 23","The post XRP Price Prediction For May 23 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market has been quite active lately, but XRP’s price hasn’t moved as much as some other coins — at least for now. However, XRP is known for quick, unexpected moves and it is holding steady at an important support level on the daily chart. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.45. XRP has recently shown signs of strength . Last week, it experienced a small pullback and sideways movement due to a bearish divergence. But now, the RSI indicator is moving up, suggesting this weakness might be over — especially while Bitcoin and other altcoins are bouncing back. At the moment, XRP is holding within a price range between $1.57 (April low) and $3.40 (recent high). The price has not yet shown a clear breakout in either direction. Analysts suggest this range could develop into a triangle pattern or other formations over time. Short-Term XRP Analysis In the shorter time frame, XRP is trading between $2.15 and $2.31 as support, and $2.48 to $2.61 as resistance. The price is currently moving sideways within this range, and traders are watching for a possible breakout above $2.62. If this happens, it could be the first sign of a bigger rally ahead. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Lawsuit News: Ex-SEC Attorney Opens Up About New ‘Corrected Filing’ , As long as XRP holds above its recent Monday low, the short-term trend remains positive. There’s a chance we could see a quick jump toward the $3.30–$3.40 zone, especially if Bitcoin and the broader market continue to gain momentum. What to Keep an Eye On If XRP breaks below $2.31 and then $2.28, it might suggest that the latest short-term rally has ended, and the price could drop toward the $1.79–$2.60 region before finding new support. Overall, even though XRP is currently moving within a tight range, the bigger picture remains bullish — with no major signs of a long-term top forming just yet. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-23T01:50:39.000Z,"Crucial Protection: US Supreme Court Safeguards Federal Reserve Independence and Jerome Powell","BitcoinWorld Crucial Protection: US Supreme Court Safeguards Federal Reserve Independence and Jerome Powell The stability of the global financial system and the health of the U.S. economy often rest significantly on the actions and independence of one crucial institution: the Federal Reserve . As the central bank of the United States, its decisions on interest rates and the money supply ripple through markets worldwide, influencing everything from borrowing costs for businesses and families to the valuation of assets, including the dynamic cryptocurrency space. Recent news, highlighted by a Bloomberg report, brings into focus a significant legal development reinforcing the Fed’s unique position, specifically addressing concerns about potential political pressure on its leadership, like Chairman Jerome Powell . Understanding the Federal Reserve and Its Unique Structure Before diving into the recent legal news, it’s helpful to understand what the Federal Reserve is and why its structure is considered ‘quasi-private’ and unique. Established in 1913, the Fed was designed to provide a more stable and secure financial system for the nation. It’s not a typical government agency in the same way as, say, the Department of Commerce. Here’s a quick breakdown: Structure: It’s composed of a Board of Governors appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks (which are technically owned by member commercial banks), and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which sets monetary policy. Funding: The Fed is self-financing, earning income primarily from interest on government securities it holds. It does not rely on congressional appropriations, which is a key element of its independence. Mandate: Congress sets the goals for monetary policy, which are maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The Fed has the independence to choose how to pursue these goals. This blend of public purpose and private-like structure contributes to the concept of Fed independence . Why is Fed Independence Crucial for Economic Stability? The concept of Fed independence is not just an academic one; it’s widely seen by economists and policymakers as essential for effective monetary policy and overall economic stability. The primary argument for independence is to insulate monetary policy decisions from short-term political pressures. Imagine a scenario where interest rates were set directly by elected politicians. During economic downturns, there might be immense pressure to lower rates excessively or print money to stimulate the economy rapidly, even if such actions risked runaway inflation down the line. Conversely, during booms, there might be reluctance to raise rates to cool the economy for fear of slowing job growth before an election. An independent central bank, like the Federal Reserve , can make difficult but necessary decisions – like raising interest rates to combat inflation even if it causes short-term pain – based on economic data and long-term goals, rather than the political cycle. This ability to prioritize long-term price stability and sustainable employment is considered a major benefit. Historical examples from various countries suggest that central banks with greater independence tend to have better track records in controlling inflation. The US Supreme Court Weighs In: Protecting Leadership Like Jerome Powell The Bloomberg report specifically highlighted a US Supreme Court ruling that appears to significantly bolster the legal protections surrounding the leadership of independent federal agencies, and by extension, the Federal Reserve . While the ruling itself might have stemmed from a different agency or context, the interpretation, as reported by Bloomberg, is that its principles apply to the Fed due to its independent structure. The core of the matter often revolves around the President’s power to remove the heads of these agencies. Unlike cabinet secretaries who serve at the pleasure of the President, the heads of independent agencies typically have some form of protection, often requiring ‘for cause’ removal rather than arbitrary dismissal. The Supreme Court’s stance in the relevant ruling reportedly affirmed or clarified the strength of these protections. This is particularly relevant in the context of past tensions between former President Donald Trump and current Fed Chair Jerome Powell . During his presidency, Trump frequently and publicly criticized Powell and the Fed’s monetary policy decisions, particularly interest rate hikes. This led to speculation and concern among some observers about whether a president could attempt to remove a Fed Chair they disagreed with. The Supreme Court ruling, as interpreted by Bloomberg, seems to have largely settled these concerns by reinforcing the legal barriers to such a dismissal, confirming that the Fed Chair, like heads of other independent agencies with similar structures, cannot be easily fired without proper legal justification. How Does This Protection Influence Monetary Policy and Markets (Including Crypto)? So, what does a Supreme Court ruling on agency head removal have to do with monetary policy and, say, the price of Bitcoin? Quite a bit, actually. Monetary policy decisions – setting interest rates, managing the Fed’s balance sheet – are the primary tools the Fed uses to influence the economy. These decisions directly impact liquidity in the financial system, the cost of borrowing for individuals and businesses, and the attractiveness of different asset classes. A Fed Chair who feels secure in their position, protected from political reprisal for unpopular but necessary decisions, is more likely to pursue consistent, data-driven monetary policy aimed at achieving the Fed’s long-term mandates. Conversely, a Chair who feared arbitrary dismissal might be tempted to make policy decisions that are politically expedient in the short term, even if detrimental to the economy in the long run. For financial markets, including the relatively new and often volatile cryptocurrency market, stability and predictability from the central bank are generally viewed positively. While crypto markets react to a unique set of factors, they are not immune to macroeconomic forces. Decisions on interest rates, for instance, influence the broader risk-on/risk-off sentiment in markets. When rates are low and liquidity is high (often during periods of accommodative monetary policy), investors may be more inclined to invest in riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. When rates rise (during tightening monetary policy), safer assets like bonds become more attractive, potentially reducing appetite for crypto. The Supreme Court ruling, by reinforcing the independence and security of the Fed Chair’s position, contributes to the perception of stable and predictable monetary policy making. This clarity reduces a potential source of uncertainty that could otherwise add volatility to markets. Challenges and Considerations Regarding Independence While Fed independence is widely supported, it’s not without its critics or challenges. One key area of debate is accountability. If the Fed is independent of direct political control, to whom is it accountable? The Fed does report to Congress and its leadership testifies regularly, but decisions are made internally. Another challenge is ensuring transparency in decision-making processes. While the Fed has made strides in communicating its policy intentions and rationale, the inner workings can still seem opaque to the public. Balancing independence with appropriate oversight and transparency remains an ongoing discussion. Actionable Insights from the Bloomberg Report What can we take away from this Bloomberg report and the Supreme Court ruling it highlights? Reinforced Stability: The legal framework protecting the Federal Reserve ‘s leadership appears stronger, reducing the likelihood of politically motivated removals of the Fed Chair. Predictable Policy? Greater security for the Fed Chair supports the institution’s ability to pursue its mandated goals through consistent monetary policy , free from immediate political pressure. Reduced Uncertainty: For markets, including crypto, this removes a potential tail risk related to the political interference in central banking. Focus Remains on Economics: The primary drivers of Fed decisions will continue to be economic data related to inflation and employment, rather than shifts in political winds regarding the Chair’s position. Compelling Summary In conclusion, the Bloomberg report on the US Supreme Court ruling underscores a vital aspect of the American financial system: the protected independence of the Federal Reserve . By reinforcing the legal safeguards around the Fed Chair’s position, the ruling, as interpreted by Bloomberg, significantly reduces the potential for a president to dismiss the head of the central bank, as was a subject of past speculation concerning Jerome Powell and former President Trump. This legal certainty is crucial because it allows the Fed to pursue stable and effective monetary policy based on economic fundamentals, rather than short-term political considerations. For the economy and financial markets, including the cryptocurrency world, this reinforced Fed independence provides a greater degree of predictability and stability in the crucial realm of central banking decisions.

2025-05-23T01:40:41.000Z,"Crucial SEC Crypto ETF Decisions: Delays Hit XRP, Litecoin, Bitcoin; Staked TRX ETF Acknowledged","BitcoinWorld Crucial SEC Crypto ETF Decisions: Delays Hit XRP, Litecoin, Bitcoin; Staked TRX ETF Acknowledged The world of cryptocurrency investment products is constantly evolving, with significant attention focused on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Investors and enthusiasts eagerly await regulatory clarity, particularly concerning the approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that offer easier access to digital assets. Recently, the SEC made several announcements regarding pending applications, leading to a mix of anticipated delays and noteworthy acknowledgments in the SEC crypto ETF landscape. Understanding the Latest Crypto ETF Delays According to insights shared by Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, the SEC has formally pushed back its decision deadlines for a number of proposed crypto-related ETFs. While delays are not uncommon in the regulatory process, especially for novel or complex financial products like those tied to cryptocurrencies, these specific postponements highlight the ongoing cautious approach by the commission. The delayed filings include: Bitwise and CoinShares’ XRP ETFs: Two separate proposals seeking to offer exposure to the XRP cryptocurrency. A Litecoin ETF: A filing focused on the Litecoin cryptocurrency. Fidelity’s In-Kind Bitcoin ETF: This specific filing is for a Bitcoin ETF that would allow for ‘in-kind’ creations and redemptions, a structure different from the cash-only creation/redemption mechanism of the spot Bitcoin ETFs already approved. These delays mean the SEC requires more time to review the applications, potentially soliciting further public comments or conducting deeper analysis into market structure, custody solutions, and potential for manipulation concerning these specific assets and fund structures. While frustrating for applicants and investors hoping for quicker access, it’s part of the standard regulatory procedure for complex filings. Why Are Crypto ETF Delays Significant? Every delay from the SEC regarding a crypto ETF filing is closely watched by the market for several reasons: Market Sentiment: Delays can sometimes dampen market enthusiasm for the underlying asset, signaling continued regulatory hurdles. Path to Approval: While not necessarily a rejection, repeated delays can indicate the SEC has significant questions or concerns that need addressing. Institutional Interest: ETFs are popular investment vehicles for institutional investors and retail traders alike. Delays push back the timeline for broader market access and potential capital inflows. Regulatory Precedent: The SEC’s decisions on these filings, particularly for assets like XRP and structures like in-kind Bitcoin ETFs, could set precedents for future crypto investment products. The market has seen this pattern before. The journey to the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 was marked by numerous delays over several years, illustrating that patience is often required when navigating the U.S. regulatory landscape for crypto products. Spotlight on the XRP ETF Delays The postponement of decisions on the Bitwise and CoinShares XRP ETF proposals is particularly noteworthy. XRP’s regulatory status in the U.S. has been complex due to the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple Labs. While Ripple has achieved some favorable rulings regarding programmatic sales of XRP not being investment contracts, the overall legal picture is still evolving. The market has been anticipating potential XRP ETF filings, hoping that the partial legal clarity might pave the way for such products. However, the SEC’s decision to delay suggests they are taking a cautious approach, likely waiting for more definitive outcomes in the ongoing legal proceedings or requiring more time to assess the unique market dynamics and regulatory considerations surrounding XRP. The potential approval of an XRP ETF is seen by many as a significant catalyst for the asset, potentially bringing increased liquidity and mainstream investor access. The delays, while expected by some given the circumstances, push this potential catalyst further into the future. What About the Bitcoin ETF Delay? Fidelity’s in-kind Bitcoin ETF filing is also among those delayed. This is distinct from the cash-create/redeem spot Bitcoin ETFs that began trading earlier this year. In an in-kind structure, authorized participants (APs) would exchange actual Bitcoin for ETF shares (creation) and exchange ETF shares for actual Bitcoin (redemption). The SEC has historically preferred cash-only mechanisms for crypto ETFs, citing concerns about the custody and valuation of the underlying assets during the creation/redemption process in an in-kind model. The delay on Fidelity’s filing indicates the SEC is still scrutinizing the feasibility and regulatory compliance of this alternative structure, even after approving cash-based spot Bitcoin ETFs. While the market already has access to spot Bitcoin ETFs, the approval of an in-kind version could potentially offer minor operational or tax advantages depending on the fund structure and jurisdiction. The delay means this specific option remains on hold for now. A Glimmer of Hope: The Staked TRX ETF Acknowledgment Amidst the news of delays, there was a positive development: the SEC formally acknowledged Canary Funds’ proposal for a staked TRX ETF. An acknowledgment is the first step in the regulatory process, indicating the SEC has received the formal filing and the clock has started on their review period. It does not imply approval but is a necessary step towards it. The significance here lies in the ‘staked’ component. Traditional ETFs typically hold the underlying asset passively. A staked ETF, however, would aim to generate yield by participating in the staking mechanism of the underlying proof-of-stake cryptocurrency, in this case, TRON (TRX). What is Staking? Staking is a process available with many proof-of-stake blockchains where holders of the cryptocurrency can lock up their coins to support the network’s operations (like validating transactions) and in return, earn rewards, similar to earning interest. A staked TRX ETF would potentially offer investors exposure to the price movements of TRX while also passing on staking rewards, providing a potentially higher yield compared to a non-staked ETF. This could be an attractive feature for investors seeking passive income from their crypto holdings within a familiar ETF wrapper. Challenges for Staked ETFs: While innovative, staked ETFs present unique challenges for regulators: Slashing Risk: Staking involves risks, including ‘slashing,’ where a portion of staked assets can be penalized and lost if the validator node acts maliciously or goes offline. How would an ETF manage and disclose this risk? Yield Variability: Staking rewards can fluctuate based on network conditions, participation rates, and inflation models. This adds complexity compared to a simple price-tracking ETF. Custody and Control: Staking involves locking up assets and delegating them to validators. The custody and control mechanisms within an ETF structure would need careful consideration to ensure investor protection. Regulatory Classification: How does the income generated from staking fit into existing securities regulations? Is it yield, or something else? Despite these challenges, the acknowledgment of a staked TRX ETF proposal is a forward step, signaling that the SEC is beginning to engage with more complex, yield-generating crypto product structures beyond simple spot price tracking. The Broader SEC Crypto ETF Landscape These recent actions by the SEC underscore the dynamic and evolving nature of the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies in the United States. While the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs was a landmark moment, the path for other single-asset ETFs (like XRP or Litecoin) and more complex structures (like in-kind Bitcoin or staked ETFs) remains uncertain and subject to rigorous review. The SEC’s mandate is to protect investors and maintain fair and orderly markets. Their cautious approach reflects ongoing concerns about market volatility, potential manipulation, and the nascent nature of the crypto market compared to traditional finance. Each filing presents unique questions related to the specific asset, the proposed fund structure, custody arrangements, and surveillance sharing agreements. The acknowledgment of the staked TRX ETF suggests the industry is continuing to innovate and propose new ways for investors to gain exposure to crypto, pushing the boundaries of what regulators have previously considered. It opens the door, however slightly, to the possibility of ETFs that capture not just price appreciation but also native network yield. Actionable Insights for Investors What do these developments mean for you as an investor? Patience is Key: The regulatory process is slow. Don’t base investment decisions solely on anticipated ETF approvals or delays. Understand the Product: If and when new crypto ETFs are approved, take the time to understand their specific structure (e.g., spot vs. futures, cash vs. in-kind, staked vs. non-staked), fees, and underlying risks. Diversification: Don’t put all your hopes (or capital) into one specific asset based on ETF speculation. Maintain a diversified approach based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Stay Informed: Keep track of regulatory news from the SEC and other bodies. Regulatory clarity is a major factor influencing the maturation of the crypto market. Conclusion The recent actions by the SEC regarding various crypto ETF filings paint a clear picture of the current regulatory climate: cautious progress mixed with significant scrutiny. While delays for XRP ETF, Litecoin ETF, and in-kind Bitcoin ETF proposals highlight the ongoing hurdles for bringing novel crypto products to market, the acknowledgment of the first staked TRX ETF filing signals that the door is not entirely closed to innovation. These developments underscore the importance of regulatory milestones in the crypto industry’s journey towards mainstream adoption. As the SEC continues its review process, the market will be watching closely for further decisions that will shape the future of crypto investment products.

2025-05-23T01:30:29.000Z,"Bitcoin: Trump’s Bold Claim on US Dominance in Crypto Explained","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: Trump’s Bold Claim on US Dominance in Crypto Explained In a recent statement that has captured the attention of the digital asset world, former U.S. President Donald Trump asserted that the United States is currently ‘dominating’ in the realm of Bitcoin and crypto . This bold claim, reportedly made by Trump and shared by Watcher Guru on X, included a promise to ‘keep it that way.’ But what does this assertion really mean for the rapidly evolving landscape of digital currencies in the US ? What Does “Dominating” Mean for US Crypto? When a figure like Trump speaks about the US ‘dominating’ in Bitcoin and crypto , it can be interpreted in several ways. It could refer to the sheer size of the American market, the level of innovation happening within the country, or perhaps a political stance aimed at fostering growth and leadership in the sector. The US is undoubtedly a major player, boasting significant institutional investment, a large base of retail investors, and numerous blockchain companies pushing technological boundaries. Market Size: The US holds a substantial portion of the global crypto market capitalization and trading volume. Innovation Hub: Silicon Valley and other tech centers are home to many leading blockchain and crypto startups. Institutional Adoption: American financial institutions have shown increasing interest and involvement in Bitcoin and other digital assets. Talent Pool: The US attracts top talent in blockchain development and cryptography. However, the idea of ‘dominance’ is complex. While the US has strengths, it also faces significant challenges, particularly concerning regulation . The Impact of US Regulation on Crypto Dominance One of the most frequently discussed aspects of the US crypto market is its regulatory environment. Unlike some other countries that have established clear frameworks, the US approach has often been described as fragmented and uncertain. Various agencies, including the SEC, CFTC, and Treasury, have asserted jurisdiction, leading to confusion and sometimes conflicting guidance. This regulatory uncertainty can be seen as both a challenge and, paradoxically, a driver of innovation (as companies navigate complex rules). However, many in the industry argue that clearer, more predictable regulation is essential for the US to truly maintain or enhance its leading position. For instance, the ongoing debates surrounding whether certain cryptocurrencies are securities or commodities, and the lack of a clear path for registering and operating crypto businesses, can hinder growth and potentially push innovation offshore. Trump ‘s statement suggests a desire for the US to be a leader, which implies a need to address these regulatory hurdles effectively. Trump’s Evolving Stance on Bitcoin and Crypto Interestingly, Trump ‘s public stance on Bitcoin and crypto has evolved over time. Previously, he expressed skepticism, even calling Bitcoin a ‘scam against the dollar.’ His current position, emphasizing US dominance and the intent to ‘keep it that way,’ signals a significant shift. This evolution likely reflects the growing mainstream acceptance of digital assets and their increasing relevance in the global economy and political discourse. His current view aligns more closely with a segment of the Republican party that is increasingly vocal about supporting crypto innovation and pushing back against what they see as overreaching regulation from agencies like the SEC. This political alignment could have significant implications for future policy if he were to return to office. Why is US Leadership in Crypto Important? Maintaining a leading position in the Bitcoin and crypto space is seen by proponents as crucial for the US economy and its future competitiveness. Leadership in this sector can translate into: Economic Growth: Fostering the growth of crypto companies creates jobs and stimulates investment. Technological Advantage: Being at the forefront of blockchain technology ensures the US remains a global leader in digital innovation. Financial Inclusion: Digital assets can potentially offer new avenues for financial services to underserved populations. National Security: A strong domestic crypto industry can be important for cybersecurity and countering illicit finance, though this is also a complex area of regulation . Trump ‘s emphasis on ‘dominance’ highlights the geopolitical and economic importance he now seems to place on this sector. Challenges to Maintaining Dominance Despite Trump ‘s optimistic outlook, the US faces several challenges in maintaining its perceived dominance: Regulatory Competition: Other countries and regions are actively creating clearer regulatory frameworks to attract crypto businesses. Talent Migration: Regulatory uncertainty can lead companies and talent to move to more favorable jurisdictions. Public Perception: Negative headlines related to scams or market volatility can impact broader adoption and political will. Infrastructure: Ensuring robust and secure digital infrastructure is essential for mass adoption. Effectively navigating these challenges will require coordinated efforts between policymakers, regulators, and the private sector. What’s Next for Bitcoin and Crypto in the US? Trump ‘s statement adds another layer to the ongoing political discussion surrounding Bitcoin and crypto in the US . As the country heads towards future elections, the stance of political leaders on digital assets is becoming an increasingly important factor for voters and the industry alike. His commitment to ‘keep it that way’ suggests a potential policy direction focused on fostering growth, although the specifics of how that would be achieved, particularly regarding regulation , remain to be seen. The conversation around US dominance in crypto is far from over. It involves complex interplay between technological innovation, market forces, and the ever-evolving landscape of regulation . Trump ‘s words serve as a reminder that digital assets are now firmly on the political radar, and future policies will significantly shape the country’s role in this global phenomenon. Conclusion Donald Trump ‘s recent assertion that the US is ‘dominating’ in Bitcoin and crypto is a notable moment, signaling a shift in his public stance and highlighting the growing political recognition of the sector’s importance. While the US has significant strengths contributing to its position, maintaining true dominance will require addressing persistent challenges, particularly the need for clear and effective regulation . The future of Bitcoin and crypto in the US will likely be shaped by continued technological advancement, market dynamics, and crucially, the policy decisions made by its leaders.

2025-05-23T01:14:30.000Z,"Michigan lawmakers file 4 crypto bills on retiree funds, CBDCs, mining","Michigan lawmakers have introduced four crypto-related bills covering crypto mining, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and crypto in state retirement funds. Republican state Representative Bill Schuette introduced House Bill 4510 on May 21, which would amend Michigan’s Public Employee Retirement System Investment Act to allow the state treasurer, currently Rachael Eubanks, to invest in cryptocurrencies that have averaged a market cap above $250 million over the last calendar year. Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) are the only cryptocurrencies that currently meet that threshold. The bill adds that any cryptocurrencies must be held in the form of an exchange-traded product issued by a registered investment company. A similar bill was introduced in February, permitting the state treasurer to allocate up to 10% of Michigan’s Budget Stabilization Fund into crypto. Republican Representative Bryan Posthumus led the introduction of the second bipartisan crypto bill on May 21, HB 4511 , which would prohibit Michigan from banning crypto or imposing licensing requirements on crypto holders. It would also prohibit state officials from advocating or supporting a proposed CBDC from the federal government. The bill defines advocating or supporting a CBDC to involve issuing a memorandum or official statement endorsing a CBDC proposal related to its testing, adoption or implementation. Source: Bitcoin Laws Michigan to consider two crypto mining bills HB 4512 , the third crypto bill introduced by a bipartisan group led by Democratic Representative Mike McFall, would create a Bitcoin mining program allowing operators to set up at abandoned oil and gas sites. A supervisor would be assigned to determine how much oil or gas could reasonably be expected to be produced from the site, who the last operator of the site was and how long it has been left unused. Related: US Senate moves forward with GENIUS stablecoin bill Those seeking to participate in the program would need to submit legal documents outlining their organizational structure, demonstrate their ability to operate as a Bitcoin mining entity and provide estimates of the breakeven price for a profitable venture.

2025-05-23T01:00:33.000Z,"US Stock Market: Crucial Day Ends Mixed, What It Means for Crypto","BitcoinWorld US Stock Market: Crucial Day Ends Mixed, What It Means for Crypto Hey crypto enthusiasts! While your focus might be firmly on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the latest altcoin moves, paying attention to the broader financial landscape, particularly the US Stock Market , is absolutely crucial. Why? Because what happens in traditional markets often sends ripples into the world of digital assets. Today, the major U.S. stock indexes closed with a decidedly mixed performance, leaving many investors wondering about the signals this sends. Let’s dive into the details and explore what this could potentially mean for your crypto portfolio. Breaking Down the Numbers: Nasdaq Performance , S&P 500 Index , and Dow Jones Industrial Average Let’s look at the specifics of how the three main U.S. stock indexes wrapped up the trading day. It wasn’t a unified move; instead, we saw a bit of a split decision among these market bellwethers. Here’s the quick rundown: S&P 500 Index : Closed down slightly, posting a -0.04% change. This index is often seen as a broad gauge of the U.S. equity market, representing the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies. A slight dip here suggests a touch of caution or sector-specific weakness. Nasdaq Performance : Stood out with a positive move, gaining +0.28%. The Nasdaq Composite is heavily weighted towards technology and growth stocks. Its positive close could indicate continued strength or renewed investor interest in the tech sector, which often has closer ties to the risk-on sentiment that can also benefit crypto. Dow Jones Industrial Average : Finished essentially flat, showing a -0.00% change. The Dow tracks 30 large, publicly-owned companies based in the United States. Its near-unchanged state suggests stability among some of the nation’s industrial and established giants, but also a lack of strong directional conviction. Here’s that data in a simple table format: Index Daily Change S&P 500 -0.04% Nasdaq +0.28% Dow Jones -0.00% This mixed picture from the US Stock Market tells us that investors weren’t universally buying or selling across the board. There were likely specific sectors or individual company news driving these differing outcomes. Why is the US Stock Market Performance So Important for Crypto? You might wonder why a crypto news site is focusing on the traditional stock market. Great question! Historically, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have shown varying degrees of correlation with the US Stock Market , particularly with tech-heavy indexes like the Nasdaq. Here’s why this relationship matters: Investor Sentiment: Both stocks (especially growth stocks) and cryptocurrencies are often considered ‘risk-on’ assets. When investor confidence is high and they are comfortable taking on more risk, both markets can benefit. Conversely, during periods of fear or uncertainty, investors tend to move towards ‘risk-off’ assets like bonds or cash, selling off both stocks and crypto. Macroeconomic Factors: Big economic news – like inflation data, interest rate decisions by the Federal Reserve, or jobs reports – impacts both traditional financial markets and the crypto space. A mixed stock market close might reflect investor indecision or differing interpretations of recent economic signals, which can also create uncertainty in the crypto market. Liquidity: Global liquidity conditions, influenced by central bank policies, affect how much capital is available to flow into various asset classes, including both stocks and crypto. Institutional Adoption: As more large institutions invest in crypto, their portfolio decisions are often guided by broader market conditions and their performance in traditional assets. If their stock holdings are under pressure, it might influence their crypto strategy. While crypto aims to be a decentralized alternative, it currently operates within the broader global financial ecosystem. Therefore, understanding the pulse of the US Stock Market provides valuable context. The Big Question: What is the Potential Crypto Market Impact ? Given the mixed close in the US Stock Market , what could this mean for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the rest of the crypto market? It’s rarely a simple one-to-one relationship, but we can draw some potential connections: Ambiguity Reigns: A mixed day in stocks often translates to a lack of clear direction in crypto as well. The conflicting signals from the S&P 500/Dow vs. Nasdaq reflect underlying uncertainties that likely affect crypto investor sentiment similarly. Nasdaq’s Tech Influence: The positive Nasdaq Performance could be seen as a cautiously positive signal for crypto, given the historical correlation between tech growth stocks and digital assets. If the optimism in tech persists, it might spill over into crypto. No Strong Catalyst: A mixed close doesn’t provide a strong bullish or bearish catalyst from the traditional finance side. This means the crypto market might continue to trade based more on its own internal factors, like network developments, regulatory news, or specific tokenomics updates. Potential for Decorrelation: Sometimes, during periods of uncertainty in traditional markets, crypto can start to move independently, acting as an alternative investment class. A mixed stock market day, lacking a clear panic or euphoria, could be one such period where crypto charts its own course. However, strong evidence of sustained decorrelation is still debated. The key takeaway is that a mixed stock market close suggests caution and division among traditional investors. This sentiment often mirrors, or at least influences, the mood within the crypto community, leading to potentially sideways price action or increased volatility as traders react to conflicting signals. Actionable Insights: Navigating Markets When the US Stock Market is Mixed As a crypto investor, how should you approach days like this when the US Stock Market sends mixed signals? Here are a few actionable tips: Stay Informed on Macro: Don’t just watch crypto charts. Keep an eye on major economic news releases (inflation, jobs, Fed speeches). These are often the underlying drivers affecting both markets. Watch Key Correlation Points: Pay attention to how Bitcoin reacts specifically to significant moves in the Nasdaq. Is the historical correlation holding, weakening, or strengthening? Focus on Crypto Fundamentals: When external signals are mixed, internal crypto factors become more important. Research project developments, adoption rates, regulatory clarity, and network activity. Manage Risk: Mixed markets can be volatile. Ensure your portfolio is diversified (within crypto and potentially across asset classes if that’s your strategy) and consider using risk management tools like stop-losses. Avoid making impulsive decisions based solely on a single day’s mixed stock performance. Long-Term Perspective: For long-term crypto investors, a mixed day in stocks is just noise. Focus on your investment thesis for the digital assets you hold. Understanding the interplay between traditional finance and crypto is part of becoming a more informed and resilient investor in the digital asset space. The mixed close in the US Stock Market today serves as a reminder that these connections exist and are worth monitoring. In conclusion, the day’s mixed performance across the US Stock Market indexes – with the Nasdaq showing modest gains while the S&P 500 and Dow remained near flat – reflects a complex picture in traditional finance. While not a direct command signal for crypto, this lack of clear direction in stocks often contributes to uncertainty or sideways movement in the digital asset market. The potential Crypto Market Impact is likely one of cautious observation, with investors weighing the Nasdaq’s positive performance against the broader market’s indecision. Keeping an eye on these traditional indicators, alongside core crypto developments, remains a prudent approach for navigating the interconnected financial world.

2025-05-23T01:00:27.000Z,"Analysts Project a 13,000% Window: MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Cardano May Be Lining Up for Explosive Action","As the crypto market gears up for a potentially explosive second half of 2025, analysts are highlighting a rare convergence of high-upside opportunities. MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Cardano (ADA) are now at the center of attention, with projections suggesting a combined window for gains that could reach 13,000% for early entrants. While Bitcoin and Ethereum provide stability and institutional support, MAGA’s presale momentum and aggressive ROI forecasts are making it the breakout contender for those seeking exponential returns. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Early-Stage Presale With 13,000%+ Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as one of the most compelling presale projects of 2025, with over $8 million raised and its price still under $0.001 as Stage 8 nears completion. Analysts are projecting up to 18,500% potential returns, with many conservative models settling around a 13,000%–15,000% upside window based on listing targets, community growth, and scarcity-driven tokenomics. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political meme appeal are driving rapid accumulation by both retail and institutional investors. As Stage 8 fills and the $0.007 listing target approaches, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being positioned as a rare ground-floor opportunity—one that could rival the early days of SHIBA INU or DOGE, but with a more transparent structure and scarcity-driven upside. XRP: Bullish Catalysts and Institutional Momentum XRP is trading above $2.30, buoyed by legal clarity, the launch of CME futures, and ongoing ETF speculation. Analysts forecast a move to $2.80–$3.40 by early June, with some optimistic scenarios targeting $4.50 if bullish momentum persists. The recent conclusion of Ripple’s SEC lawsuit and confirmation that XRP is not a security have removed major overhangs, setting the stage for further institutional adoption. While XRP’s upside is strong, its growth potential pales in comparison to the exponential returns possible with early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the window for outsized gains is still wide open. Cardano: Technical Setup and Growth Forecast Cardano (ADA) is showing strong technical signals, with a double bottom on the weekly chart and a bullish outlook for 2025. Analysts predict ADA could range from $0.66 to $1.88 this year, with a stretched bullish target of $2.36 if key support levels hold. While ADA remains a favorite for long-term holders, its near-term upside is less dramatic compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. As capital rotates into high-upside plays, many Cardano holders are now diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE to maximize portfolio growth. Bitcoin and Ethereum: Macro Anchors With Rotating Capital Bitcoin (BTC) remains the market’s foundation, trading above $100,000 and drawing record inflows from institutional investors. Analysts forecast a possible run to $250,000 by year-end if current momentum holds. Ethereum (ETH) is holding steady near $2,600, with bullish technicals and ongoing upgrades supporting its long-term outlook. While both BTC and ETH are core holdings for stability, the biggest near-term upside is shifting toward early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the risk/reward profile is far more compelling for growth-focused investors. Kaspa: Quiet Growth, But MAGA Steals the Spotlight Kaspa (KAS) is gaining traction for its blockDAG architecture and scalability, but its price action remains subdued compared to the explosive presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. As capital seeks sharper returns, MAGA’s early-stage appeal and viral narrative are making it the go-to allocation for traders chasing the next 10x–50x winner. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion Analysts are projecting a 13,000% window for early entrants in MAGACOIN FINANCE, with XRP and Cardano also positioned for significant gains as the market heats up. With Stage 8 nearly full, a $0.007 listing target, and a rapidly growing community, MAGA stands out as the top early-stage opportunity of 2025. For those seeking the next top presale winner, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the name on every analyst’s and trader’s watchlist.

2025-05-23T01:00:00.000Z,"Whales Are Rotating Into MUTM as BTC Nears $110K — And That Says a Lot About Its 2025 Outlook","In recent weeks, a shift in capital flow has become increasingly clear. While retail investors continue to chase post-breakout momentum, whale wallets — those holding significant amounts of capital — are making more deliberate moves. One of the clearest signals? Large holders are beginning to rotate into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) while Bitcoin edges closer to $110,000. This isn’t random. Whales are known for positioning early, often ahead of the broader market. Their entry into MUTM speaks volumes about how this DeFi crypto project is being valued behind the scenes — especially with its fundamentals strengthening and its utility set to go live by the time the token launches. For many investors tracking the top cryptocurrencies showing early momentum, this is a signal worth noting. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance has already completed Phase 4 of its presale, raising nearly $9 million and attracting over 11,000 holders. The token price has risen from $0.025 to $0.03, and with a launch price confirmed at $0.06, investors buying now are already positioned for a 100% surge by the time it hits public exchanges. Despite this increase, the current price is still seen as a favorable entry — especially by large wallets that recognize the value of locking in upside before listings. With 11 presale phases in total, the early momentum has been strong, but there’s still room for newcomers to enter before the next price jump. For those wondering what crypto to buy now, MUTM is quickly emerging as one of the most talked-about new tokens in the market. One major factor behind whale interest is the dual lending architecture of the platform. Mutuum provides users with access to both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models. In the P2C model, users deposit assets into a shared liquidity pool and earn yield based on pool usage. Interest rates adjust dynamically depending on how much of the pool is borrowed, offering a passive, automated earning mechanism. The P2P model, however, introduces even more flexibility. Users can negotiate terms directly with one another, allowing for tailored agreements. This is particularly appealing for tokens that don’t fit neatly into conventional lending frameworks — including memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) or Dogecoin (DOGE). Through this system, borrowers and lenders can interact around volatile or niche assets while avoiding the limitations of centralized matching. Whales understand the value of that flexibility — especially in a DeFi crypto market where capital efficiency and asset diversity are becoming more important than ever. It’s one reason MUTM is being highlighted on lists of top crypto to buy among early investors looking beyond short-term hype. BTC Nears $110K — But Smart Capital Is Already Rotating As of this week, Bitcoin is nearing the $110,000 mark, continuing its climb following a wave of institutional inflows and expanding ETF activity. While this movement has captured headlines, the price increase is no longer unexpected — the uptrend has been building for months. What is more noteworthy is where strategic capital is now flowing. Instead of allocating heavily to BTC at elevated levels, larger wallets are starting to diversify into tokens like MUTM, where the growth potential from current pricing is substantially greater. For those looking for the best cheap crypto to buy now, this rotation is becoming increasingly significant. Stablecoin Development Adds Even More Depth Another reason whales are leaning in? Mutuum Finance’s overcollateralized stablecoin is currently under development. This new token will be minted directly from excess collateral within the lending protocol and pegged algorithmically to the U.S. dollar. Unlike centralized stablecoins or opaque algorithmic models, Mutuum’s approach is fully decentralized and backed on-chain. When borrowers provide collateral to mint the stablecoin, they’re interacting with smart contracts that ensure the supply remains overcollateralized at all times. This stablecoin will offer an additional layer of utility, creating a dependable medium of exchange within the ecosystem while also boosting liquidity. For investors exploring what cryptocurrency to invest in today, real-time utility like this adds a level of practicality that goes beyond pure speculation. With utilities going live at launch, presale momentum building, and institutional-style accumulation happening early, analysts now believe that MUTM would surge by up to 2300% shortly after listing. From its current presale price of $0.03, that would place the token around $0.72, potentially even higher if exchange support aligns with projected timelines. For example, a $750 investment at $0.03 would yield $17,250 when the token hits that $0.72 mark — a level some forecasts consider conservative when factoring in platform usage and liquidity flow. This kind of projection is why some now include MUTM in discussions of the next big cryptocurrency poised for breakout performance. While Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines with new highs, serious investors are already looking for the best crypto to invest in with longer-term upside — and the data shows they’re finding it in MUTM. With whales rotating in ahead of listings, a platform launch on the horizon, and mechanisms already in place to support long-term value, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as more than just a presale — it’s shaping up to be a central player in DeFi’s next wave. And for those paying attention now, it’s still early.

2025-05-23T00:30:58.000Z,"Bitcoin’s Breakout to $111K Sets the Stage — MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP Could Be the Next to Explode","Bitcoin’s historic surge above $111,000 has sent shockwaves through the crypto market, confirming a new phase of bullish momentum. As institutional inflows and regulatory optimism fuel BTC’s rally, attention is rapidly shifting toward high-upside altcoins. MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP are now at the center of analyst discussions, with both seen as leading candidates for the next explosive breakout in 2025. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Powerhouse With 18,500% Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the standout presale of 2025, with over $8 million raised and its presale price still under $0.001. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political meme appeal are driving rapid community growth and early-stage investor participation. Analysts are projecting up to 18,500% potential returns, with some calling a $1 target by year-end “not out of reach” given current momentum. As Stage 8 nears completion and the $0.007 listing target approaches, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being positioned as a rare ground-floor opportunity—one that could rival the early days of SHIBA INU or DOGE, but with a more transparent structure and scarcity-driven upside. With whale allocations and rapid presale sellouts highlighting strong conviction, MAGA stands out as the top breakout contender for Q3. XRP: Bullish Structure and Institutional Catalysts XRP has surged over 300% since late 2024 and is now consolidating near $2.35, with whale accumulation and renewed institutional interest following the launch of CME futures and ongoing ETF speculation. Analysts forecast a move to $2.80–$3.40 by early June, with some optimistic scenarios targeting $4.50 if bullish momentum persists. Positive regulatory developments—including the conclusion of Ripple’s SEC lawsuit and confirmation that XRP is not a security—have removed major overhangs, setting the stage for further institutional adoption. As capital rotates from Bitcoin into high-upside altcoins, XRP is increasingly viewed as a core holding for those seeking both stability and significant upside. Bitcoin: The Macro Anchor With Record Institutional Demand Bitcoin’s rally to $111,000 is fueled by unprecedented institutional inflows, robust ETF adoption, and a wave of optimism around regulatory clarity. With spot Bitcoin ETFs attracting billions in fresh capital and major financial players like BlackRock leading the charge, BTC’s dominance is undeniable. However, as Bitcoin stabilizes and its market cap grows, the biggest near-term upside is shifting toward early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the risk/reward profile is far more compelling for growth-focused investors. Solana and Aptos: Strong Fundamentals, but MAGA Steals the Spotlight Solana (SOL) continues to lead among Layer-1 platforms, with strong DeFi usage, developer activity, and whale accumulation supporting its price near $170. Aptos (APT) is also gaining traction with network upgrades and developer interest. Yet, as capital seeks sharper returns, both SOL and APT are being outpaced by the explosive presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is quickly becoming the go-to allocation for traders chasing the next 10x–50x winner. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Conclusion Bitcoin’s breakout to $111,000 has set the stage for a new wave of crypto growth, but the real excitement is building around MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP. With MAGA’s presale nearing completion and XRP’s bullish structure and institutional catalysts, both tokens are positioned for explosive gains in the coming months.

2025-05-23T00:30:39.000Z,"Bitcoin ATH Met With Mixed Whale Reactions – What’s The Market Signal?","Yesterday, Bitcoin (BTC) made a fresh all-time high (ATH) of $111,880 on Binance crypto exchange following months of downward action during the first quarter of the year. The leading cryptocurrency has rebounded over 45% from its April 6 low of approximately $76,000, and recent whale behavior suggests that long-term holders see further upside potential. Bitcoin ATH Sees Mixed Reaction From Whales According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Crazzyblockk, new whales – wallets that have held substantial BTC amounts for less than 30 days – have been aggressively taking profits during the current price rally, contributing to increased selling pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Demand Rises 3.4% As Small Investors Return To The Market – New ATH Soon? In contrast, old whales – wallets holding significant BTC for over six months – have shown minimal selling activity. This indicates long-term confidence in Bitcoin and expectations of continued price appreciation. Meanwhile, whales active between 7 to 30 days ago have engaged in moderate profit-taking, suggesting cautious participation in the ongoing rally. While the restrained activity from old whales is a positive signal, some indicators point to caution regarding the rally’s sustainability. For example, the Net Realized Profit/Loss (NRPL) during the current price surge is significantly lower than levels observed during previous 2024-2025 market tops. This indicates weaker overall profit-taking momentum among investors. For the uninitiated, NRPL measures the net profit or loss investors are locking in when they sell their Bitcoin, based on the price difference between acquisition and sale. A high NRPL indicates strong profit-taking behavior, while a low or negative NRPL suggests reduced enthusiasm or capitulation. Is The Market Headed Further Up? Although a low NRPL may imply that the market is not yet euphoric – a potentially healthy sign – it also raises concerns about the strength and sustainability of the ongoing rally. These dynamics could influence BTC’s price trajectory across different timeframes. Related Reading: Buy Bitcoin, Ditch The Banks Before It’s Too Late—Kiyosaki In the short-term, continued profit-taking by new whales may trigger a price correction to neutralize overheated market conditions. A drop in price could send BTC back to the $100,000-$105,000 support zone. In contrast, in the mid-term, the ongoing inactivity of old whales coupled with low NRPL levels could support a bullish continuation after a consolidation phase. Investors may view pullbacks as opportunities to accumulate more BTC. To conclude, while a short-term price correction remains possible, the mid-term outlook for Bitcoin is largely optimistic – assuming old whales maintain their positions and NRPL remains low. This aligns with recent on-chain analyses showing that many new BTC investors are sitting on solid unrealized gains and are not showing signs of panic selling, despite Bitcoin trading close to ATHs. At press time, BTC trades at $111,500, up 4.2% in the past 24 hours.

2025-05-23T00:20:39.000Z,"Bitcoin ETF In-Kind Redemption Delay: SEC’s Concerning Pause on Fidelity Funds","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin ETF In-Kind Redemption Delay: SEC’s Concerning Pause on Fidelity Funds Hey there, crypto enthusiasts and investors! We’ve got some significant news from the regulatory front that could impact how your spot Bitcoin ETF and potential Ethereum ETF investments function. According to reports circulating, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has apparently hit the pause button on approving the ‘in-kind’ redemption mechanism for Fidelity’s spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds. This isn’t just a technical hiccup; it’s a development with potential implications for the structure and, importantly, the tax efficiency of these popular investment vehicles. What Exactly Are In-Kind Redemptions for a Bitcoin ETF, and Why Do They Matter? Let’s break down what ‘in-kind’ redemptions mean in the context of an ETF. When you redeem shares of an ETF, you’re essentially selling them back to the fund. There are two primary ways this can happen: Cash Redemptions: The fund manager sells the underlying assets (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) and gives you cash in return for your shares. In-Kind Redemptions: Instead of selling the assets, the fund manager gives you a proportional amount of the actual underlying asset (Bitcoin or Ethereum) in exchange for your shares. This process typically happens between the ETF issuer and large institutional participants (Authorized Participants or APs), not individual retail investors directly. For a Bitcoin ETF or any commodity-based ETF, in-kind redemptions are generally considered the gold standard, primarily because of their impact on Crypto ETF tax efficiency . When a fund uses cash redemptions, selling the underlying asset can trigger capital gains taxes *within* the fund itself. These gains are then passed on to shareholders at the end of the year, potentially increasing your tax burden even if you haven’t sold your shares. In contrast, in-kind redemptions avoid this internal selling process, making the fund structure more tax-efficient for long-term holders. How Does the SEC Delay Impact Fidelity’s Ethereum ETF Aspirations? While spot Bitcoin ETF s are already trading, the regulatory path for a spot Ethereum ETF is still uncertain. Fidelity is among several firms that have filed for a spot Ethereum ETF. The reported SEC delay on in-kind redemptions for their *existing* Bitcoin ETF application (and presumably their Ethereum filing, which would likely seek similar redemption mechanisms) casts a shadow on how a future Ethereum ETF might operate if approved. If the SEC maintains its stance against in-kind redemptions, any approved spot Ethereum ETF from Fidelity (and potentially others) might be forced to operate solely on cash redemptions. This would mean investors in an Ethereum ETF could face the same potential tax inefficiencies as those in a cash-only Bitcoin ETF. Understanding the SEC Delay: What Are the Potential Reasons? The exact reasons behind the SEC delay aren’t always explicitly stated in these procedural pauses, but we can speculate based on the SEC’s past behavior and concerns regarding crypto. Potential reasons could include: Regulatory Caution: The SEC is notoriously cautious when it comes to cryptocurrencies. They may be scrutinizing the operational complexities and risks associated with fund managers directly handling and transferring volatile digital assets during redemptions. Market Manipulation Concerns: While spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved after addressing concerns about market surveillance, the SEC might still harbor worries about the potential for manipulation during large in-kind redemption processes, especially involving assets like Ethereum, which they have sometimes referred to as potentially being securities. Operational Logistics: Ensuring the seamless and secure transfer of Bitcoin or Ethereum from the fund to Authorized Participants during redemptions involves complex technical and custodial arrangements that the SEC might want to review thoroughly. Setting Precedent: The SEC’s decision on in-kind redemptions for Fidelity could set a precedent for other existing and future crypto ETFs, including those holding different digital assets. It’s important to remember that a delay is not an outright denial. It signifies that the SEC requires more time to review the specifics of the proposed mechanism and ensure it aligns with investor protection mandates and market integrity rules. Exploring Crypto ETF Tax Efficiency: Cash vs. In-Kind Redemptions Let’s delve a bit deeper into the tax implications, as this is arguably the most significant consequence for investors. Understanding Crypto ETF tax efficiency is crucial. Imagine a scenario where many investors decide to redeem their ETF shares. If the fund uses cash redemptions, the fund manager must sell a portion of the fund’s Bitcoin or Ethereum holdings to get the cash needed. If the price of Bitcoin or Ethereum has risen since the fund acquired those specific coins, selling them triggers a capital gain *inside* the fund. This gain is then distributed proportionally to all shareholders at the end of the year, regardless of whether those shareholders redeemed their shares or not. This can lead to unexpected tax bills for investors holding the ETF in taxable brokerage accounts. With in-kind redemptions, when an AP redeems shares, they receive Bitcoin or Ethereum directly from the fund’s holdings. No sale occurs *within* the fund itself to generate cash for the redemption. Therefore, no capital gains are realized at the fund level, and no capital gains distributions are passed on to remaining shareholders. This makes the in-kind structure significantly more tax-efficient, particularly for long-term investors. The SEC delay on approving this mechanism for Fidelity means that, for now, their ETFs may need to rely solely on cash redemptions, potentially impacting the tax efficiency compared to a scenario where in-kind was permitted. Actionable Insights: Navigating the In-Kind Redemptions Situation So, what does this mean for you as an investor or someone considering investing in a Bitcoin ETF or potential Ethereum ETF ? Understand the Redemption Mechanism: Check the prospectus or documentation for the specific ETF you hold or are considering. While the delay impacts Fidelity, other issuers might have different structures or be subject to similar reviews. Know if the fund uses cash or in-kind redemptions (or a mix). Consider Tax Implications: If a fund uses cash redemptions, be aware that you might receive capital gains distributions, even if you haven’t sold your shares. This is particularly relevant for holdings in taxable brokerage accounts. Consider holding periods and potential tax liabilities. Stay Informed: Regulatory decisions can change. Keep an eye on announcements from the SEC and ETF issuers regarding the approval status of in-kind redemptions. Consult a Tax Professional: Tax laws are complex, and the implications of ETF structures can vary based on your individual circumstances. A tax advisor can provide personalized guidance. The SEC delay highlights the ongoing complexities of integrating digital assets into traditional financial structures. While the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs was a major step, nuances like redemption mechanisms show that regulatory scrutiny remains high. In Conclusion: The SEC’s Pause and What It Signifies The reported SEC delay in approving in-kind redemptions for Fidelity’s spot Bitcoin ETF and potential Ethereum ETF is a notable development. While not halting the funds themselves (in the case of the Bitcoin ETF), it impacts a key structural feature that enhances Crypto ETF tax efficiency . This decision underscores the SEC’s cautious approach to the crypto market, scrutinizing operational details that are standard in other asset classes but raise unique questions when applied to volatile and novel digital assets. Investors should be mindful of the implications, particularly regarding potential tax outcomes, and stay informed as regulators continue to navigate the integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance.

It’s an increase of 30% since the start of May as derivatives speculators load up on leverage in anticipation of higher Bitcoin prices.Open interest is the total number of outstanding futures contracts that allow traders to bet on the future price of Bitcoin, which have not been settled or closed, showing the total amount of current market speculation.Total Bitcoin futures OI. Source: CoinglassWhen OI surges, it indicates massive leveraged positions are built up in the market, with lots of traders holding large positions with borrowed money. If Bitcoin’s price moves against these over-leveraged positions, traders get forcibly liquidated, and the flushout can create selling pressure on Bitcoin, which can cause a rapid drop in prices and high volatility.However, analysts suggest the surge in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows, which have seen more than $2.5 billion this week, can counter some of that extended leverage.Related: Crypto perp futures coming ‘very soon,’ says CFTC’s MersingerBitcoin options markets show a similar pattern with open interest over $1.5 billion at the $110,000 and $120,000 strike prices on the Deribit exchange.

2025-05-23T05:11:25.000Z,"Trendspotting in crypto: How to discover winning projects before the crowd","TL;DRSpotting the next big crypto project before it explodes demands data, discipline and a sharp eye for real signals. This guide explores how to identify early winners by analyzing onchain metrics, tokenomics, dev activity and community traction while avoiding the common traps of hype-driven pumps and red-flag projects.Despite the crypto space being crowded, fast-moving and full of noise, some investors manage to consistently find promising projects while they’re still under the radar.So, how do they do it? Crypto trendspotters know how to read onchain data. They understand tokenomics. They read GitHub commits and follow the money. It takes more than jumping on the hype bandwagon ahead of the crowd.This guide breaks down how to find crypto projects with real potential using lessons from past winners like Solana, Arbitrum, Chainlink and even memecoins like Pepe. Along the way, it will highlight the tools that matter, red flags to avoid and the difference between organic growth and manufactured buzz.How the real winners took offSolanaWhen Solana launched in 2020, few outside of developer circles had heard of it. But it had one big edge: speed. Solana’s proof-of-history tech made it one of the fastest chains around, and it quickly became a magnet for builders, especially in DeFi and NFTs. By 2021, its ecosystem exploded with apps like Serum and Magic Eden.Early adopters who paid attention to onchain growth — like wallet activity and DEX volume — could see something brewing. Solana (SOL) went from under $1 to $50+ in less than a year. Arbitrum Arbitrum launched in 2021 as an Ethereum layer 2, but its big moment came with the Arbitrum (ARB) token airdrop in March 2023. At launch, Arbitrum was already processing more transactions than many layer 1s and had billions in total value locked (TVL) in decentralized applications (DApps).Smart investors were watching. Even before the token, the signs were there: user activity, rising liquidity and growing app adoption. When ARB dropped, the pump stuck because the foundation was real.ChainlinkChainlink is a classic example of a project with long-term utility. It doesn’t have flashy branding or meme power, but it does one thing incredibly well: feed real-world data into smart contracts.By 2024, it had become the backbone of much of DeFi, gaming and even tokenized real-world assets. If you were watching closely in 2019-2020, you saw LINK (LINK) getting integrated everywhere. That kind of early utility often flies under the radar — until price action catches up.PEPE Coin (PEPE)Let’s not pretend memes don’t matter. Pepe (PEPE) launched in 2023 with no roadmap, no utility and no VC backing. But it hit a nerve, and the internet ran with it. The coin hit a billion-dollar market cap within weeks.That kind of run is rare — and risky. But for traders tracking social sentiment, wallet distribution and community activity, the early signals were all there. PEPE didn’t promise anything, but it delivered returns by becoming a viral moment.How to find crypto gems earlySo, how do you separate the next Solana from the next rug pull? Here’s how serious trendspotters approach it.1. Start with onchain metricsPublic blockchains are transparent. Use that to look at:Daily active walletsTransaction volumeTokenholder growthLiquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs)TVL (for DeFi projects).If users and capital are moving in — before the token moons — that’s a great sign. Tools like Dune Analytics, Nansen and DefiLlama are your best friends here.2. Understand the tokenomicsAsk questions like:What’s the total supply? How much is circulating?Are there upcoming unlocks or vesting cliffs?Who holds the tokens, and how concentrated are the top wallets?Is there utility? Does the token do anything?Tokens with capped supply, smart incentives (like staking or burn mechanisms) and fair distribution models tend to do better long-term.3. Check developer activityIs the team actually building?GitHub is a goldmine. Look at how often code is pushed, how many contributors are active, and whether the repo looks alive. No updates for months? Big red flag.You don’t need to read code — just track commits and releases. Projects with real traction are always shipping.4. Look for ecosystem signalsAre other developers building on top of it? Are DApps launching? Is liquidity growing? Are users coming back week after week?Ecosystem growth is hard to fake, and it’s often the strongest early indicator that a project has legs.5. Follow the communityX, Discord, Telegram, Reddit — yes, it’s noisy. But it’s also where trends start. Look beyond the price talk:Are people actually using the product?Are devs answering questions?Is the tone constructive or just hype?Use LunarCrush or Santiment to track social momentum, but always double-check it with onchain data.Key tools to spot crypto trendsHere’s a quick rundown of the top platforms used by smart crypto trendspotters:Top tip: Don’t just use one tool. Great traders cross-reference everything.Crypto trend analysis 2025A coin might be flying, but is it because people are actually using it or just talking about it? Learning to tell the difference can save you from making a bad investment. Signs of real tractionSteady user growth and TVL over time: If users are showing up before a token pumps — and the numbers keep climbing week over week — that’s usually a sign of substance. You’ll often see this in DeFi protocols or layer 2s gaining trust slowly, not overnight.Code commits and product updates: A live GitHub with regular commits, active devs and visible progress means the team is building. This shows momentum and long-term focus — not just a marketing push.More tokenholders, less whale control: When new holders join steadily — and supply isn’t all locked up by the top five wallets — it’s a healthier setup. Distributed ownership reduces the risk of rug pulls or coordinated dumps.New integrations and ecosystem activity: If other apps are integrating the token or building on the protocol, it usually means the tech is solid and useful. This kind of network effect compounds fast and often precedes a breakout.Liquidity that builds slowly: Gradual increases in liquidity and trading volume tend to reflect real interest. If liquidity sticks around (rather than vanishing after a pump), it’s usually organic.Signs of manufactured hypeSudden spikes in social mentions or trading volume with no news: If the project is everywhere on X overnight, but there’s no product update, launch or roadmap shift, be skeptical. It’s likely a coordinated shill.Influencer spam and recycled talking points: When you see multiple anonymous influencers posting the same meme or catchphrase, that’s a signal someone’s trying to manufacture buzz.No dev activity or roadmap: If there’s no GitHub, no changelog and the team isn’t shipping anything, it’s probably just a hype machine.Anonymous team, outrageous promises: Combine a mystery team with claims like “100x guaranteed,” and you’re likely looking at a cash grab. Real builders let the work speak for itself.Rule of thumb: If the price is moving and everything else — users, devs, integrations — is standing still, you’re looking at hype. But when those fundamentals are quietly ticking up in the background? That’s when it’s worth a closer look.More red flagsSome projects look great on the surface — slick websites, trending hashtags, a fast-moving chart — but fall apart under the hood. Here are some more red flags to watch out for:High holder concentration: If most of the token is sitting in a handful of wallets, it doesn’t take much for a price crash. Whales often buy early and dump on retail.Unverified token contracts: A token that hasn’t been verified on Etherscan or BscScan might hide functions that allow minting, blocking wallets or draining liquidity. Always check the contract or look for an audit.No liquidity lock or audit: If the devs control all the liquidity provider tokens and there’s no lock or time-locked contract, they can pull the rug at any moment. Similarly, no third-party audit? That’s a gamble.Big token unlocks coming up: Large unlocks for insiders or early investors can trigger huge sell-offs. If you’re holding during a major vesting event, you could be exit liquidity. Know the schedule.Top tip: Before you click buy, ask, Who stands to gain the most if this pumps? Who gets hurt if it dumps? If the answer points to a few insiders with heavy bags and zero accountability, walk away.How to spot crypto trends before the crowdThe best early investors are the mechanics looking under the hood. They study token structures and unlock schedules, join communities early to catch signals firsthand, and follow the builders to see who’s actually shipping. Most importantly, they cross-check everything: on-chain data, social sentiment, developer activity, and liquidity. Tools like Dune, DefiLlama, Nansen and GitHub help them separate noise from substance — and spot winners before the crowd does.Crypto rewards those who are curious, critical and a little bit contrarian. The crowd usually shows up late. If you want to find gems before they moon, you’ll need to think independently, dig deeper, and act before the narrative forms.It’s not easy. But it’s doable. And the more you practice spotting early signals — the real ones, not the noise — the more second nature it becomes.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

It would also prohibit state officials from advocating or supporting a proposed CBDC from the federal government.The bill defines advocating or supporting a CBDC to involve issuing a memorandum or official statement endorsing a CBDC proposal related to its testing, adoption or implementation.Source: Bitcoin LawsMichigan to consider two crypto mining billsHB 4512, the third crypto bill introduced by a bipartisan group led by Democratic Representative Mike McFall, would create a Bitcoin mining program allowing operators to set up at abandoned oil and gas sites. A supervisor would be assigned to determine how much oil or gas could reasonably be expected to be produced from the site, who the last operator of the site was and how long it has been left unused.Related: US Senate moves forward with GENIUS stablecoin billThose seeking to participate in the program would need to submit legal documents outlining their organizational structure, demonstrate their ability to operate as a Bitcoin mining entity and provide estimates of the breakeven price for a profitable venture.The fourth bill, HB 4513 — also filed by a McFall-led bipartisan group — would amend Michigan’s income tax laws to include income obtained from the proposed Bitcoin mining program.Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/michigan-lawmakers-introduce-four-crypto-bills?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

According to a report from My London, Jacob Irwin-Cline went out to a London bar and had several drinks before calling an Uber to take him home.Cline said that he did not thoroughly check the details of the Uber ride on his phone and left with a random private cab driver resembling the Uber driver at first glance, but driving a different vehicle — a detail Cline would only discover after the incident.Once inside the vehicle, the US tourist said the driver offered him a cigarette, which Cline said was likely laced with a rare and potent sedative drug called scopolamine. Cline added that the cigarette made him feel extremely docile and tired, causing him to pass out for around 30 minutes before regaining consciousness.Shortly after Cline woke up, the driver ordered him out of the vehicle. As Cline exited, the driver suddenly sped off, striking him with the car and fleeing with his cellphone, which contained his private keys and access to his crypto accounts.The unfortunate incident comes amid a recent spate of kidnappings, extortion incidents, armed robberies, and ransom attempts directed at crypto industry executives, investors, and their families.

However, Noizat's daughter and another individual were able to fight off the masked attackers.The rise in violent attacks against crypto investors and professionals has prompted an increase in personal security, including requests for bodyguards and private security measures for those likely to be victimized.Magazine: China’s ‘point running’ crypto scams, pig butchers kidnap kids: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/american-tourist-drugged-fake-uber-driver-robbed-123k-btc?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The proposed amendment would come after 18 Democrats sided with Republicans in the Senate in voting to advance the bill on May 20 after it failed a procedural vote on May 8.“Passing the GENIUS Act without our anti-corruption amendment stamps a Congressional seal of approval on Trump selling access and influence to the highest bidder,” Merkley said in a May 22 X post.Trump his three sons are involved in the crypto platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI), which launched its USD1 stablecoin in March. Critics have pointed out that the president could continue to personally benefit from legislation that helps recognize stablecoins like USD1 as financial instruments in the US. Related: US lawmaker introduces anti-corruption bill ahead of Trump’s dinnerAn Abu Dhabi-based investment firm said that it would use USD1 to settle a $2-billion investment in Binance, effectively allowing the president’s family to profit from the transaction fees. Democratic lawmakers have already called for an investigation into Trump’s connections to the platform, which was largely dismissed as “flawed” by WLFI co-founder Zach Witkoff.Stablecoins are just one of many potential conflicts, say DemocratsMerkley and Warren are also planning responses to Trump hosting a dinner at his golf club for up to 220 people who purchased the most significant amounts of his personal memecoin. Merkley is expected to attend a protest organized by the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, in partnership with progressive political organization Our Revolution, outside the Trump venue on May 22. Warren held a press conference with Merkley, Senator Chris Murphy and Public Citizen representatives, calling on Trump to “release the guest list” for the dinner event. Though a few of the potential attendees have publicly announced they were the owners of the wallets who purchased the memecoin and intended to go, the majority were still anonymous at the time of publication.“What is happening tonight — this private, secret dinner — in which individuals who have put money in Donald Trump’s pocket, get access to him, is maybe the most corrupt of all the corruption,” said Murphy, adding:“They were able to pay their way in to get an audience with the President of the United States to ask for favorable national security concessions.”Cointelegraph reached out to the White House for comment, but had not received a response at the time of publication.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/senators-amendment-genius-act-world-liberty-financial-stablecoin?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The $2.2 billion position in futures markets signals growing interest from traders, but it is not necessarily bullish, as those instruments can also be used to speculate on the XRP price downside.XRP futures open interest on major exchanges, XRP. Source: CoinGlassSome traders argue that the increased demand for leveraged XRP positions indicates growing institutional interest, especially as multiple issuers filed for a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) listing in the US. However, the final decision by the US SEC should be made in October.Excessive demand for bullish leveraged XRP causes a positive funding rate, meaning longs (buyers) are the ones paying the carry cost.

Still, the current optimism level is nowhere near the 100% annualized funding rate from Dec. 4, 2024, which followed an impressive 7-day rally to $2.90 from $1.33. Far from being bearish, the current level leaves room for bullish positioning on XRP futures markets.Related: Which senators invest in crypto? 11 lawmakers have blockchain-related investmentsFavorable regulation opens the door for new partnerships and acquisitionsPart of the limited XRP price upside can be explained by the multiple rejections of US Senator Cynthia Lummis, Chair of the US Congress Digital Assets Subcommittee, to meet Ripple representatives. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse asked on May 19 that the lawmaker “reconsider and be a leader for ALL of crypto,” and discuss “how to make the US the crypto capital of the world.”There is nothing stopping XRP from hitting $3.50 or even higher, as Ripple Labs is no longer facing direct threats from regulators, which paves the way for partnerships and acquisitions. Historically, XRP has reacted very positively following those announcements, and the $2.2 billion futures open interest could help catapult XRP price above the current $3.25 all-time high.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Ives simply referred to them as a “new design movement” that would be similar to Apple’s family of hardware and software integrations. OpenAI has raised billions of dollars from investors, who view the company as a stalwart in the AI industry following the overwhelming success of its ChatGPT large language model (LLM). As of May, ChatGPT had nearly 800 million weekly active users, according to industry data. These usage trends were behind OpenAI’s massive $157 billion valuation as of October 2024 — a figure that nearly doubled to $300 billion by March 2025.ChatGPT usage trends.

However, SOL needs a clear market structure break (MSB) or a decisive bullish breakout above $180 to trigger the next leg of the rally. Declining volumes during the consolidation phase suggest caution, as a lack of buying pressure could stall the breakout. If SOL fails to breach $180, the immediate key area of interest is between $140-150, and the bull flag pattern would be invalidated.

2025-05-22T15:00:00.000Z,"Semiconductor exemptions don’t matter when it comes to tariffs","Opinion by: Ahmad Shadid of O.xyzSemiconductors scored a rare exemption from US President Donald Trump’s aggressive reciprocal tariffs, but the relief is symbolic at best. Most semiconductors enter the US embedded in servers, GPUs, laptops, and smartphones. The finished goods remain heavily tariffed, some with duties reaching up to 49%. The exemption looks good politically but delivers little practical benefit. Nvidia’s DGX systems, crucial for training advanced AI models, do not fall under the exempted HTS codes. Nvidia could pay effective tariffs nearing 40% on these vital components. Such costs threaten to stall critical AI infrastructure projects across the country. Semiconductor tariffs may compromise the goal of the CHIPS Act. The act promised tens of billions of dollars in subsidies to support domestic chip manufacturing. Yet advanced lithography machines — key equipment from countries like the Netherlands and Japan — face 20%–24% tariffs. Ironically, tariffs designed to boost American production increase the cost of essential manufacturing equipment.The effect of new tariffs is already slowing progress in critical supply chains — just as generative AI and large language models are gaining momentum across sectors like finance and defense. Any delays or cost increases now could blunt America’s technological advantage.Indirect costs undermine exemptions for AIModern semiconductor supply chains are global and highly integrated. An exemption on raw silicon means nothing when servers, GPUs and other finished products face steep tariffs. Tariffs indirectly inflate costs, eliminating any competitive advantage from domestic manufacturing.Indirect tariff costs hit high-end systems disproportionately hard. The effect ripples through AI model training, data center expansions and major infrastructure projects, significantly slowing the industry’s momentum.Tariff impasse halts investmentSo far, it’s clear that the US president’s tariff plan didn’t follow any conventional economic trends or calculated strategy. The uncertain tariff situation stalls investment decisions across the technology sector. Companies need predictable costs to justify large capital expenditures. Ongoing tariff volatility prevents them from committing resources to new data centers and manufacturing lines.This mirrors the supply chain chaos of 2020. At that time, uncertainty caused massive order cancellations and slowed industry recovery for years. If tariff ambiguity continues, we could see similar waves of cancellations in 2025. This would further compound existing inventory and revenue issues in the semiconductor sector.Domestic production is not optimalThe border argument for these tariffs is that they’re meant to boost domestic production. They do little, however, to encourage genuine domestic semiconductor production. Despite subsidies under the CHIPS Act, most US semiconductor companies still rely on international foundries for manufacturing. Instead, they face increased equipment and operational costs.Recent: How trade wars impact stocks and cryptoThe idea that tariffs promote domestic production ignores the reality of global semiconductor manufacturing. Costs rise across the board, putting American companies at a disadvantage rather than offering protection.AI projects face heightened riskThe blockchain and crypto sectors, particularly AI-driven projects, also feel the pinch. Projects depend heavily on GPUs and high-performance servers for mining, validating transactions and running decentralized AI computations. Increased hardware costs directly affect profitability and growth, potentially stalling innovation in blockchain applications. AI developments have just started to pick up the pace in the blockchain and Web3 space. The industry saw increased interest from investors and VCs just a year ago. So, they are still on tighter budgets. Elevated costs can, however, lead to stagnation. We might see innovators and developers exiting the market. The ripple effect extends beyond the general technology sector and could threaten future digital economies. Moreover, these cost pressures disproportionately affect startups and smaller tech firms. Industry giants can absorb additional expenses, but innovative, smaller players face existential threats. This dynamic risks stifling innovation at the grassroots level, harming the entire tech ecosystem.What to expect Semiconductors have momentarily escaped direct tariffs, but the exemption provides little benefit. Tariffs continue to hit finished products, driving up indirect costs across the industry. Instead of boosting domestic manufacturing, these tariffs create economic paralysis, stall critical infrastructure projects, and threaten America’s lead in AI innovation. Policymakers must acknowledge these realities and adjust their approach before irreversible damage is done to the nation’s technological future.Opinion by: Ahmad Shadid of O.xyz.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-22T13:30:00.000Z,"How staking incentivizes trust without burning energy","What if a financial system could run itself not by burning electricity, but by rewarding good behavior? That’s the promise of staking, a mechanism that powers many modern blockchains by turning users into network operators. In this week’s episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Gareth Jenkinson and Nathan Jeffay sit down with StarkWare’s Noam Nisan to unpack how this trustless engine works, why it matters and what’s really at stake.Understanding stakingJeffay began by highlighting how staking is part of the backbone that keeps the blockchain running, and runs itself, with volunteers.“By doing this, they’re saying, OK, we’re taking this task of running the blockchain seriously. Here's some of our money. We're putting it down. We're showing that we're serious about doing this.”To help unpack this topic further and examine the deeper mechanics behind staking, the hosts are joined by Noam Nisan, principal researcher at StarkWare and a widely respected computer scientist who has held roles at Google and Princeton.Related: How to handle crypto trading gains and losses on your balance sheet“So we have this general system with operators... Why would they want to do that? The system, the protocol, incentivizes them to actually run the system,” Nisan explained. “Basically, it can give them tokens for operating the system.”Staking offers what Nisan describes as two distinct types of security: computer science-based guarantees and economic disincentives for bad actors. “If a majority or supermajority, maybe two-thirds of the parties of the token of the staked amount are behaving properly... we can prove that the system acts correctly,” he said. “But you also have what I would call an economic guarantee... if they destroy the system, very likely the value of the token... will go down. So they are the one losing.”PoW vs PoSJenkinson, a vocal Bitcoin (BTC) supporter, posed the classic comparison: proof-of-work vs proof-of-stake. “Do you have any strong feelings about one or the other?” he asked.“The truth is that it’s not clear.. it's really a social question, I think.”Nisan noted that both mechanisms involve trade-offs around cost, control, and decentralization. The episode also explores the role of staking in tokenomics and system design. Nisan unpacks how fee mechanics and inflation controls, such as Ethereum’s minting curve, help keep the ecosystem in balance.To hear the full conversation on The Clear Crypto Podcast,  listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

2025-05-22T12:38:44.000Z,"UK court partially dismisses Bitcoin SV investor’s lawsuit against Binance","The United Kingdom’s Court of Appeal has partially dismissed a lawsuit brought by Bitcoin SV investors against major crypto exchanges, including Binance, for allegedly conspiring to delist the token in 2019.In a judgment handed down on May 21, the court ruled that investors who held BSV through the delisting period (classified as “sub-class B”) were not entitled to billions in speculative damages based on BSV’s hypothetical growth.These investors had claimed over 8.9 billion British pounds ($11.9 billion) in damages, asserting that Binance’s delisting deprived holders of the chance to profit from BSV’s potential rise to a “top-tier cryptocurrency” like Bitcoin (BTC) or Bitcoin Cash (BCH).The court rejected this “foregone growth effect” theory, stating, “BSV was obviously not a unique cryptocurrency without reasonably similar substitutes,” pointing to the representative’s own use of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash as comparators.Sub-class B’s central claim was that delisting led to a missed opportunity to benefit from price appreciation. However, the court determined that those investors had ample chance to mitigate losses by selling or reinvesting in other crypto assets.“They had a duty to mitigate their losses,” wrote Master of the Rolls Sir Geoffrey Vos. “They cannot recover losses that they could reasonably have mitigated.”UK court ruling against Bitcoin SV investor’s lawsuit.

The court ruled it “flawed as a matter of principle,” noting that “cryptocurrencies are, by their nature, volatile investments.”Binance’s limited strike-out application ultimately succeeded, with the court stating that even if some holders were unaware of the delisting, “they could never claim more than the total value of their holding before the delisting events plus any quantifiable consequential losses.”Related: Binance wants arbitration for all members of securities class suitBinance seeks to dismiss FTX lawsuitOn May 16, Binance filed a motion to dismiss a $1.76 billion lawsuit filed by the FTX estate, arguing that the claims are legally flawed and an attempt to shift responsibility for FTX’s collapse.The exchange stated the downfall of FTX stemmed from internal fraud, not external manipulation, citing Sam Bankman-Fried’s conviction on multiple fraud charges.Binance has asked the court to dismiss all claims with prejudice.

2025-05-22T10:21:18.000Z,"Can ChatGPT-powered AI agents really trade crypto for you?","Key takeawaysChatGPT-powered AI agents automate trading tasks using natural language prompts and API integrations, improving speed and consistency.Successes occur when ChatGPT is used as a support tool, not a fully autonomous trading system.Failures happen when traders over-rely on ChatGPT without real-time data, proper risk management or manual oversight.Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance.What if a crypto trader didn’t need to constantly check charts, worry about emotions, or stay up all night watching for sudden price swings? What if those tasks could be handled by an intelligent agent that understands instructions in plain English — and reacts within milliseconds? That’s where ChatGPT-powered AI agents come in.These tools combine natural language processing with real-time trading logic to automate decision-making in one of the world’s most volatile markets. From rebalancing portfolios to reacting to market sentiment, ChatGPT is being adapted to act as a trading assistant, risk manager and market analyst — all rolled into one. But can it truly match or even outperform human intuition? This article explores how far these agents have come, where they shine and where they still fall short.How ChatGPT-powered AI agents operate in cryptocurrency marketsChatGPT-powered AI agents are changing how people interact with crypto markets. These tools combine ChatGPT’s language abilities with external trading tools and APIs to help users monitor prices, understand trends and even place trades automatically. Instead of just reacting to charts or numbers, ChatGPT can understand plain language commands like “Buy Ethereum if the price drops below $2,000” or “Sell Bitcoin if RSI goes above 70.”These AI trading assistants can work with major platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, OKX and other centralized or decentralized exchanges and can also tap into decentralized finance (DeFi) tools and smart contracts. With the right setup, ChatGPT can help automate trading strategies based on both technical data and market news.Success stories vs. failures in ChatGPT-powered crypto tradingSome traders have used ChatGPT to assist in automating parts of their crypto trading processes, particularly for strategy generation and sentiment analysis. For example, a user shared on Reddit that they used a ChatGPT-based AI agent for technical analysis on Ether (ETH), feeding it four-hour and daily chart screenshots. By interpreting market sentiment, support and resistance zones, and other indicators, they managed to make $6,500 in profits.Similarly, in the broader crypto sector, ChatGPT has been applied to support project development activities such as drafting white papers and marketing content. A notable example is the launch of the “TURBO” memecoin, which reportedly reached a market capitalization of over $50 million in 2024. In this case, ChatGPT was used to streamline documentation and communication rather than manage trading activity, illustrating its usefulness as a support tool in crypto-related initiatives.However, limitations are evident when ChatGPT is applied beyond its core design. While ChatGPT could suggest a trading portfolio and explain its reasoning clearly, it lacks access to real-time market data and couldn’t respond to sudden volatility. In one instance, ChatGPT was allocated $100 across multiple tokens but failed to actively manage the portfolio as prices fluctuated. This resulted in missed opportunities and underperformance compared to dynamic algorithmic strategies.Individual experiences reinforce these observations. A Redditor exposed a scam where a YouTuber promoted a “ChatGPT trading bot” tutorial that led users to deploy malicious smart contracts. The contracts, generated using ChatGPT and passed off as safe, were designed to drain user wallets once funded. Victims collectively lost $17,240 in ETH, highlighting the danger of blindly trusting AI-generated code without proper auditing.Even when asked, “If I use ChatGPT to build an AI agent for crypto trading, can I become a millionaire?” ChatGPT responded with a realistic outlook — acknowledging that while it’s possible, success depends on having a profitable strategy, disciplined risk management, and the ability to scale effectively.Here is ChatGPT’s response:These cases suggest that while ChatGPT can support certain elements of the trading process, it should not be treated as a standalone solution for autonomous crypto trading.AI in crypto trading: Key benefits and limitationsAI tools like ChatGPT are increasingly being integrated into crypto trading workflows to improve speed, accuracy and efficiency. While they offer important advantages, they also carry specific limitations that traders must actively manage. Below are the main benefits and challenges:Key benefits of using AI for crypto tradingAI bots can execute trades in milliseconds, crucial for capturing opportunities in fast-moving crypto markets.Bots follow pre-programmed rules precisely, eliminating emotional biases that often affect human traders.Crypto markets are always open, and AI bots can monitor and act around the clock without interruption.A single bot can manage multiple trading pairs, exchanges and strategies simultaneously.ChatGPT can understand specific prompts like “Rebalance every Monday” or “Set stop-loss at 5%,” allowing flexible automation.Limitations of ChatGPT in cryptocurrency tradingChatGPT does not access live market data unless specifically integrated with external APIs (e.g., TradingView, CoinMarketCap or exchange websockets).Instructions must be clear and unambiguous; ChatGPT may misinterpret vague or complex commands.Improperly secured API keys or lack of two-factor authentication (2FA) can expose trading accounts to unauthorized access.ChatGPT’s cloud-based infrastructure can introduce latency, which could impact performance during highly volatile periods.ChatGPT does not monitor regional compliance rules; users must manually enforce trading limits based on local regulations.Ethical and regulatory implications of AI in crypto tradingAs AI becomes more integrated into trading systems, it raises significant ethical and regulatory concerns that stakeholders across the financial sector are beginning to address.Accountability: If an AI agent executes a harmful or unlawful trade, questions arise around legal responsibility. It remains unclear in many jurisdictions whether liability falls primarily on the developer, the trader using the AI system or the platform facilitating the transactions.Market manipulation risks: Autonomous AI bots could unintentionally engage in activities such as spoofing (placing and canceling fake orders to mislead the market) or wash trading (creating artificial volume), especially if not properly programmed with compliance safeguards.Regulatory oversight: Financial authorities, including the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the European Securities and Markets Authority, are actively studying the implications of AI and algorithmic trading. These agencies have recognized that traditional trading regulations may not fully account for autonomous decision-making by AI systems.Policy developments: In January 2024, the European Commission released updates to its Digital Finance Strategy, which included references to AI-based financial services. While not yet finalized, these draft regulations under the broader Digital Finance Package signal a move toward stricter compliance expectations for firms deploying AI in financial markets.Meanwhile, ethical crypto platforms are beginning to voluntarily disclose the use of trading bots in their systems. In parallel, open-source communities are advocating for clearer audit trails, improved model transparency and the establishment of ethical guidelines for AI applications in finance to ensure accountability and fairness.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-22T08:37:57.000Z,"Dubai regulator clarifies real-world asset tokenization rules: Lawyer","Newly updated guidelines from Dubai’s crypto regulator include provisions on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and clarify rules for issuers. On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) released its updated Rulebook for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) operating in the region. The regulator gave market participants until June 19 to comply with the new rules. The regulator previously told Cointelegraph that it had enhanced supervisory mechanisms and brought consistency across activity-based rules. One of the more prominent changes includes regulatory clarity on RWA tokens. Irina Heaver, partner at the United Arab Emirates-based law firm NeosLegal, told Cointelegraph that the updated rules clarify RWA issuance and distribution. “Issuing real-world asset tokens and listing them on secondary markets is no longer theoretical,” Heaver told Cointelegraph. “It’s now a regulatory reality in Dubai and the broader UAE.”A “viable” path to realize RWA hypeHeaver compared RWAs to security token offerings (STOs), an earlier attempt from the crypto space to tokenize securities like stocks, bonds and real estate investment trusts. However, the UAE crypto lawyer said that STOs “died a peaceful death in 2018 to 2019.” The lawyer told Cointelegraph STOs did not work out because of the lack of regulatory clarity, viable secondary market trading venues, institutional investor appetite and liquidity. Still, the situation is different for RWAs. Heaver told Cointelegraph that RWAs are the next foundational layer for institutional adoption of blockchain and virtual assets. Heaver said that VARA’s new rules already cover them as Asset-Referenced Virtual Assets (ARVA) tokens. She said: “VARA’s newly updated Virtual Asset Issuance Rulebook (May 2025) addresses these failures head-on. Regulated exchanges and broker-dealers in Dubai are now authorized to distribute and list ARVA tokens.”The lawyer said this solves an issue in jurisdictions like Switzerland, where token issuance is possible, but listing and secondary trading remain unregulated. Related: Dubai gov’t agencies to link real estate registry with property tokenizationLawyer shares requirements for RWA issuersHeaver said ARVA tokens are defined under Dubai law as representing direct or indirect ownership of real-world assets, granting entitlement to receive or share income and purporting to maintain a stable value by reference to real-world assets or income. ARVA tokens are also backed or collateralised by such real-world assets or constitute a derivative, wrapped, duplicated, or fractionalised version of another ARVA. The lawyer said issuers must meet specific requirements, including a Category 1 Virtual Asset Issuance license, a comprehensive white paper and a risk disclosure statement. In addition, issuers must have a paid-up capital of 1.5 million UAE dirhams (about $408,000) or 2% of reserve assets held.

2025-05-22T08:25:00.000Z,"5 red flags you’re being shilled: Don’t buy the hype","What is shilling in crypto?              At its core, shilling is the act of artificially promoting a cryptocurrency or token, often with exaggerated claims, to increase its price or popularity. But what’s the goal? Hype it up, get others to buy in, and then cash out, leaving latecomers holding the bag.Shilling can come from anyone: influencers, anonymous accounts or even high-profile figures with political or financial clout. The common thread is manipulation: It’s not about educating you or building real value but pumping hype for personal gain.Unfortunately, the line between enthusiastic promotion and outright deception can be thin, and many fall victim without realizing it. That’s why it’s critical to learn how to spot the signs early.                  5 red flags you’re being shilled              Beware of crypto red flags like overhyped promises, anonymous teams, influencer shills, missing products and FOMO tactics — if it smells like a scam, it probably is.1. Overhyped promises You’ve probably seen posts that scream:“100x potential!”“Guaranteed returns!”“This is your ticket to financial freedom!”These are classic shill tactics. Real, credible projects don’t promise life-changing profits. Why? Because there are no guarantees in crypto or in any investment.When a project leads with grandiose financial claims rather than actual product value or utility, it’s likely a ploy to stir FOMO and attract unsuspecting investors. The truth is, if something sounds too good to be true, it almost always is.Remember: The bigger the promise, the bigger the red flag.2. Anonymous or suspicious teams In crypto, anonymity isn’t always bad, but when you’re trusting people with your money, transparency matters.It’s a major red flag when a project has:No identifiable team membersFake names or aliasesStock photos on its websiteNo LinkedIn or professional history.The simple rule is “No face, no funds.”Scammers often hide behind anonymity because they know they’ll eventually vanish and there’ll be no one to hold accountable. Even worse, some use fabricated credentials or hire actors to pose as team members.Before investing, check whether the founders or developers have any verifiable history. Do they have prior experience in blockchain or startups? Have they launched anything successful before?3. Influencer spam and paid promotions One day, no one’s talking about a particular coin — the next, your feed is flooded with influencers hyping it up. Sound familiar?This sudden burst of attention is often coordinated with a paid promotion campaign disguised as “genuine enthusiasm.”Many influencers fail to disclose sponsorships, even though it’s required by law in many countries. The US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have cracked down on this in recent years.Take, for example:Kim Kardashian, who was fined $1.26 million in 2022 for promoting EthereumMax without proper disclosure.Floyd Mayweather Jr., who was sued for endorsing the same project at a paid event.BitBoy (Ben Armstrong), who faced legal action in multiple lawsuits for promoting scam tokens to his audience.If you notice multiple influencers promoting the same project in a short time, especially without using labels like #ad or #sponsored, it’s a strong indicator of a shill campaign.Don’t mistake volume for value. Hype doesn’t equal legitimacy.4. No real product or roadmapIf you visit the project’s website, it looks sleek, maybe even impressive. But where’s the product? Where’s the code?Shilled tokens often rely on flashy marketing but have no working application, no GitHub code and no actual use case. Everything is either “coming soon” or buried behind vague promises.Ask yourself:Can I use the platform or app today?Is there a white paper that makes sense?Do they have public repositories or open development?If all you’re seeing is a landing page and a vague roadmap that’s been “coming soon” for months, that’s a major red flag.5. Pressure tactics and FOMO Time pressure is a psychological weapon, and shillers know how to use it.Watch out for lines such as:“Presale ends in 2 hours!”“Only 1,000 spots left!”“If you don’t buy now, you’ll miss out forever!”These tactics prey on your fear of missing out (FOMO) and push you into making impulsive decisions without research.But crypto isn’t a sprint; it’s a long-term game. Anyone trying to rush you into buying likely has something to hide. Solid investments don’t need fake urgency.Take a breath, step back, and ask yourself: Am I buying because I believe in this project or because I’m being manipulated?Did you know? The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) secured a $128-million judgment against Ryan Mitchell Pope, Daniel Samuel Bishop and their company EmpiresX for operating a fraudulent forex and cryptocurrency investment scheme that defrauded over 12,500 victims.                  Is shilling illegal in crypto? Can influencers be sued?              Shilling isn’t just unethical in many cases — it’s also illegal.In the world of crypto, undisclosed promotions are a major legal risk. If someone is paid to promote a token or project but fails to reveal that financial connection, they could face fines, lawsuits or even criminal charges. This is especially true if the promoted token is later classified as a security under US law.Regulators like the SEC, FTC and CFTC have all cracked down on this behavior. Their targets have included:Influencers who failed to disclose paid promotionsPromoters who misled investors with false claimsIndividuals who ran pump-and-dump schemes using social media.Francier Obando Pinillo, a pastor from Miami, was indicted on 26 fraud counts for running a crypto scam through “Solano Fi,” defrauding investors of millions from 2021 to 2023. He allegedly used his church, social media and false promises of 34.9% monthly returns to lure victims. The platform showed fake gains but blocked withdrawals, while funds were diverted for personal use. Pinillo was arraigned in Richland, Washington and faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.As crypto becomes more mainstream, expect stricter regulations and more consequences for shillers.Did you know? Argentine President Javier Milei has dissolved the special task force investigating the LIBRA cryptocurrency scandal, a project he promoted in February 2025 that surged to a $4.5-billion valuation before crashing by over 97%. The task force, created by Milei himself, was disbanded via Decree 332/2025, citing that it had fulfilled its purpose. However, critics argue that no official findings were released, and judicial investigations into Milei and his associates continue.                  How to protect yourself from shilling scams              Do your own research, verify the team and utility, ignore hype and influencers, and stay alert to pump-and-dump schemes to avoid crypto shilling traps.Let’s understand how you can protect yourself from shilling scams in crypto:Do your own research (DYOR): Always research the project, the team behind it and the data supporting the claims. Don’t rely solely on hype or influencer recommendations. Look into onchain data, GitHub activity and the project’s utility to make informed decisions.Verify the team: A legitimate crypto project should have a transparent and credible team. If the developers are anonymous or have no professional profiles (like LinkedIn), that’s a red flag. Always check the team’s past projects and credibility before investing.Look for real utility: Does this project actually solve a problem? A genuine project should have a working product or solution, not just promises. Avoid projects that lack real-world utility or are still in “coming soon” stages for extended periods.Ignore the hype: If a token is suddenly trending on social media or being aggressively promoted, don’t let FOMO influence your judgment. Shillers often rely on emotions to push their agenda, so it’s essential to evaluate projects based on their merits, not just popularity.Stay skeptical of influencers: Influencers with large followings may be paid to promote certain tokens. Before taking their advice, ask yourself, What’s their incentive? Verify the promotion is legitimate and disclosed as paid or sponsored. Always cross-check the information with independent sources.Watch for pump-and-dump schemes: Be cautious of sudden price spikes followed by rapid drops. These are often signs of pump-and-dump schemes where the token’s value is artificially inflated by coordinated buying and then quickly sold off, leaving investors with losses. Always monitor price trends and be wary of sudden, unexplained increases in value.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/5-red-flags-youre-being-shilled-dont-buy-the-hype?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Seeker is the company’s second-generation device, after the Saga Web3 phone that launched in April 2023. The company unveiled the Seeker phone in September 2024, saying it wouldn’t just be a “memecoin phone.” So far, it has pre-sold 150,000 units.The Solana Seeker has gone through two sale phases: The Founder window, where the price for each device was $450, and the Early Adopter window, where the price per device was $500. Assuming the lower price window, Solana Mobile could generate at least $67.5 million in gross revenue from device sales. For comparison, the iPhone generated $199.3 billion in revenue for Apple in 2024.The new architecture that will govern future Solana Mobile devices is called TEEPIN, which stands for “Trusted Execution Environment Platform Infrastructure Network.” It is a three-layer architecture — hardware, platform, and network layers — that will allow users, developers, and device makers to participate in a trustless environment.Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder and CEO of Solana Labs, called TEEPIN “the next evolution in mobile” and a framework where trust is “verified by cryptography.”In addition, Solana Mobile is planning to launch “SKR,” the native asset of the Solana Mobile ecosystem. \""It transforms the traditional mobile business model by giving stakeholders actual ownership in the platform,” said Emmett Hollyer, general manager at Solana Mobile.

From a broad perspective, the $77 billion in Bitcoin futures open interest has undoubtedly played a role. However, a closer look at the data shows a more positive outlook for further price gains.Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.chThe current 7% annualized Bitcoin futures premium is well within the neutral range of 5% to 10%, which has been typical for the past two weeks. This indicator can easily exceed 30% during periods of strong optimism, so the current level is relatively low. At the same time, the absence of excessive leverage reduces concerns about a rally driven primarily by derivatives.Balanced order books and spot Bitcoin ETF inflows point to spot-driven rallyFor comparison, during the previous Bitcoin $109,346 all-time high on Jan. 20, the annualized futures premium reached 15%, showing a much higher level of leveraged bullish positions affecting the price. Therefore, the current Bitcoin derivatives market appears healthier, suggesting strong demand in spot markets.During the January bull run, Bitcoin’s price on Coinbase traded at a premium compared to other exchanges. This so-called Coinbase premium is not present now, which means buying pressure is more evenly spread out—a sign of a healthier market.Coinbase Bitcoin/USD relative to competitors. Source: TradingView / CointelegraphWhile excessive buying pressure on a single exchange is not necessarily bearish, it can make it easier to trigger unsustainable price surges when liquidity is low. This data supports the idea that derivatives markets were not the main driver of the recent price increases. Moreover, the $1.37 billion in net inflows to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States between May 15 and May 20 further suggests that spot buyers, rather than derivatives traders, were the primary force behind the rally.Despite the lack of conviction in Bitcoin futures, several indicators point to further upside. Forced liquidations of bearish BTC futures positions were relatively low at $170 million between May 18 and May 21, cementing the idea of a spot-driven rally. In comparison, the rally to $104,000 on May 9 triggered $538 million in liquidations over three days.Related: Is Bitcoin price close to a cycle top? — 5 indicators that help traders decideBitcoin options put-to-call ratio at Deribit.

2025-05-21T18:57:47.000Z,"Price predictions 5/21: BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, ADA, SUI, LINK, AVAX","Key points:Bitcoin made a new all-time high, but the bulls will have to sustain the higher levels for the momentum to pick up.Several altcoins have bounced off their respective support levels, signaling a positive sentiment.Analysts expect Bitcoin to maintain its positive momentum and surge above $200,000 by the end of the year.Bitcoin (BTC) rose to a new all-time high on May 21 on easing macroeconomic fears and continued inflows into the US-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Analysts expect the momentum to continue and Bitcoin to surge to $200,000 by the end of the year.There are some murmurs among analysts about a bearish divergence, leading to a double-top pattern. However, private wealth manager Swissblock Technologies said in a post on X that its Bitcoin Fundamental Index is not showing any bearish divergence, and the onchain strength remains intact.Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360Bitcoin is on the verge of forming a “golden cross” on the daily chart, which generally is followed by sharp rallies, barring a few instances when the pattern failed. Bitcoin’s strength is expected to improve sentiment in the cryptocurrency sector, pulling several altcoins higher.What are the possible target levels for Bitcoin? Could altcoins break above their respective overhead resistance levels? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin price predictionBitcoin rose above the $109,588 overhead resistance, but the bulls are struggling to sustain the higher levels, as seen from the long wick on the candlestick.BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) in the overbought zone indicate that the bulls are in control. If the price closes above $109,588, the BTC/USDT pair could pick up momentum and skyrocket toward $130,000.The 20-day exponential moving average ($101,958) is the critical support to watch out for on the downside. A break below the 20-day EMA will be the first sign that the bulls are booking profits in a hurry. That increases the risk of a break below the psychological support of $100,000. Ether price predictionBuyers are trying to sustain Ether (ETH) above the $2,550 level but are facing significant resistance from the bears.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping 20-day EMA ($2,334) and the RSI near the overbought zone indicate that buyers are in control. The ETH/USDT pair is likely to pick up momentum on a break above $2,739. That clears the path for a rally to $3,000.Contrary to this assumption, a break and close below the 20-day EMA signals that the bears are back in the game. The pair could tumble to $2,111, which is likely to attract solid buying by the bulls.XRP price predictionXRP (XRP) has been witnessing a tough battle between the buyers and sellers at the 20-day EMA ($2.35).XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. If the price skids below the 20-day EMA, the XRP/USDT pair may stay inside the $2 to $2.65 range for a while. Instead, if the price turns up sharply from the 20-day EMA and breaks above $2.65, the advantage will tilt in favor of the bulls. The pair could rally to $3 and, after that, to $3.40, where the sellers are expected to mount a strong defense.BNB price predictionBNB (BNB) bulls have held the 20-day EMA ($639) support during the pullback, indicating buying on dips. BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bulls will try to push the price above $693 but are expected to face solid selling by the bears. However, if buyers bulldoze their way through, the BNB/USDT pair could skyrocket to the overhead resistance at $745.This optimistic view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and breaks below the 20-day EMA. That could sink the pair to the 50-day SMA ($609). Solana price predictionSellers failed to pull Solana (SOL) below the 20-day EMA ($164), indicating demand at lower levels.SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bulls will try to propel the price above the $185 overhead resistance. If they can pull it off, the SOL/USDT pair could accelerate toward the target objective of $210 and then $220.If sellers want to prevent the upside, they will have to quickly tug the price below the 20-day EMA. The pair could slide to $153 and later to the 50-day SMA ($145). That suggests a possible range-bound action between $120 and $180.Dogecoin price predictionDogecoin (DOGE) has bounced off the breakout level of $0.21, indicating that buyers are active at lower levels.DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe 20-day EMA ($0.21) is trending up, and the RSI is in the positive zone, signaling that buyers are in command. The DOGE/USDT pair could rally to the $0.26 level, which could attract sellers. If the price turns down sharply from the overhead resistance, the pair could form a narrow range between $0.26 and $0.21 for some time.Contrarily, a break and close above $0.26 signals the start of the next leg of the up move. The pair could then surge to $0.35.Cardano price predictionThe bulls have kept Cardano (ADA) above the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders (H&S) pattern during the pullback. ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe flattish 20-day EMA ($0.74) and the RSI in the positive zone indicate the bulls have an edge. Buyers will have to thrust the price above $0.86 to signal the resumption of the uptrend. The ADA/USDT pair could then skyrocket to $1.01.This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the 50-day SMA ($0.69). That suggests the bulls are losing their grip, increasing the risk of a fall to $0.60.Related: Bitcoin enters ‘acceleration phase’ resembling BTC price gains seen after Trump election victorySui price predictionSui’s (SUI) pullback has taken support at the 20-day EMA ($3.73), indicating a positive sentiment.SUI/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory indicate an advantage to buyers. The SUI/USDT pair could reach the $4.25 obstacle, where the sellers are expected to step in. If buyers do not cede much ground to the bears, it increases the likelihood of a break above $4.25. The pair may then climb to $5.The 20-day EMA is the critical support to watch out for on the downside. A break and close below the 20-day EMA could sink the pair to the 50-day SMA ($3.04).Chainlink price predictionBuyers successfully defended the neckline of the inverse H&S pattern in Chainlink (LINK), indicating buying on dips.LINK/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bulls are trying to strengthen their position by pushing the price above the resistance line. If they manage to do that, the LINK/USDT pair could rally to $18. Sellers will try to halt the up move at $18, but the rally could extend to $19.80 if the bulls prevail.Time is running out for the bears. If they want to make a comeback, they will have to swiftly yank the price below the 50-day SMA. The pair may then remain inside the channel for a few more days.Avalanche price predictionAvalanche (AVAX) took support at the 50-day SMA ($20.88), signaling that the bulls are trying to form a higher low. AVAX/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewBuyers will have to drive and maintain the price above the $23.50 resistance to gain the upper hand. The AVAX/USDT pair could then climb to $26.84, which may act as a hurdle. If buyers overcome the $26.84 barrier, the pair could ascend to $31.73 and subsequently to $36.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance and breaks below the 50-day SMA, it suggests that the bulls have given up. The pair could then decline to $18.50.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
