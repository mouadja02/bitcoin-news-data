From Wall Street giants to crypto-savvy politicians, the United States is taking center stage in Bitcoin’s latest bull run. But it’s now a global race for control, and the two main players are the United States and China. The U.S. Is Holding More Bitcoin Than Ever Recent data from the on-chain analytical platform CryptoQuant shows that U.S.-based entities, including banks, exchanges, and funds, are now holding a bigger chunk of Bitcoin than the rest of the world. This strong buying activity recently triggered a bullish chart pattern known as a golden cross on the U.S. to Rest Reserve Ratio chart, which often signals a potential price surge. In the past, this type of signal marked the beginning of major uptrends. We saw it last year, and now it’s happening again. This shift is helping fuel the recent price jump, along with optimism over new U.S. crypto laws and growing interest from major names like Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy, Tesla, Semler Scientific, and many more. Meanwhile, the U.S currently holds overall 207189 BTC worth around 22.99 billion. Political Winds Are Blowing Bitcoin’s Way There’s also growing political support for crypto in the U.S. As President Donald Trump recently voiced strong support for crypto, even saying he wants the U.S. to lead Bitcoin mining and become the “crypto capital of the world.” Combined with new Senate talks around stablecoin laws, the U.S. is pushing hard to attract crypto innovation. Bullish Now, But Caution Ahead While things look good now, CryptoQuant’s chart also highlights what could come next. The last two times this ratio formed a “death cross,” when the short-term trend drops below the long-term, Bitcoin took a hit shortly after. So while it’s a party now, history says to keep an eye out. China Is Still a Big Player Even though the U.S is leading the race, but China quietly remains one of the biggest holders and miners of Bitcoin through indirect channels. While much of the trading is hidden or rerouted, China’s grip on mining and holding power is real, and the U.S. doesn’t want to be left behind. Although China currently holds overall 194,000 BTC, worth around 21.53 billion.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-soars-past-111k-as-u-s-traders-take-the-lead-but-for-how-long/,"ASIA|BTC|MINING|REGULATION|TRADING","News",cryptocompare
2025-05-23T06:44:17.000Z,"MicroStrategy Announces Massive $2.1B Preferred Stock Offering with 10% Dividend","BitcoinWorld MicroStrategy Announces Massive $2.1B Preferred Stock Offering with 10% Dividend In a significant financial move, MicroStrategy, the software intelligence firm known for its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy, is reportedly planning to issue up to $2.1 billion in preferred stock. This potential offering, first reported by Walter Bloomberg on X, carries a notable 10% annual dividend, signaling a strategic decision by the company to potentially raise substantial capital. What is MicroStrategy Preferred Stock and What’s Being Offered? MicroStrategy preferred stock represents a class of ownership in the company that has a higher claim on assets and earnings than common stock. Holders of preferred stock typically receive fixed dividends before common shareholders and have priority in the event of liquidation. However, they usually do not have voting rights. According to the report, MicroStrategy is aiming to issue up to $2.1 billion worth of this preferred stock. The specific terms and conditions will be detailed in the offering documents, but the headline figure of $2.1 billion suggests a substantial capital raise. This isn’t MicroStrategy’s first foray into raising capital through debt or equity to fund its Bitcoin purchases, but the scale and the nature of preferred stock make this particular move noteworthy. Understanding the Attractive 10% Dividend Yield One of the most striking features of this potential offering is the proposed 10% annual dividend. A 10% yield on preferred stock is relatively high in the current market environment, especially for a company like MicroStrategy. This high dividend rate is likely intended to attract a wide range of investors, particularly those seeking income streams. For investors, a 10% dividend offers a potentially attractive return on investment, paid out before common stock dividends (though MicroStrategy does not currently pay a common stock dividend). However, the high yield also implicitly suggests a level of risk perceived by the market or structured into the offering to make it appealing despite other potential factors like market volatility or the company’s specific business model tied heavily to Bitcoin. How Does This Fuel MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Strategy? MicroStrategy’s primary corporate strategy under Michael Saylor has been to acquire and hold Bitcoin. The company has consistently used various financial instruments, including convertible senior notes and stock offerings, to raise capital specifically for purchasing more Bitcoin. This $2.1 billion preferred stock offering appears to be another mechanism to further that core objective. By issuing preferred stock, MicroStrategy can raise significant capital without diluting the voting power of its common shareholders (as preferred stock typically has no voting rights). The capital raised would likely be used to acquire more Bitcoin, increasing the company’s overall BTC holdings. This move aligns perfectly with MicroStrategy’s stated goal of being a corporate vehicle for investing in Bitcoin. The company’s balance sheet is increasingly dominated by its Bitcoin holdings. Raising capital through preferred stock adds to its liabilities but increases its capacity to accumulate more digital assets, reinforcing its unique position among publicly traded companies. Is This MicroStrategy Investment Opportunity Right for You? Investing in MicroStrategy preferred stock comes with its own set of considerations, distinct from investing in the common MSTR stock or Bitcoin directly. Potential investors should weigh the benefits against the risks: Potential Benefits: Attractive Income: The 10% annual dividend offers a potentially high fixed return. Priority in Liquidation: Preferred shareholders have a higher claim on company assets than common shareholders if the company were to be liquidated. Potential for Capital Appreciation: While the primary draw is the dividend, the market price of preferred stock can fluctuate based on interest rates, company performance, and market sentiment. Potential Risks: Subordination to Debt: Preferred stock is subordinate to the company’s debt obligations. If MicroStrategy faced financial distress, debt holders would be paid before preferred shareholders. Call Risk: The company may have the right to ‘call’ or redeem the preferred stock at a certain price after a specific date, potentially limiting the investor’s income stream if interest rates fall. Market Risk: The value of the preferred stock can be affected by changes in interest rates and the overall market’s perception of MicroStrategy and the cryptocurrency market. No Voting Rights: Preferred shareholders typically do not have a say in company management decisions. Tied to Bitcoin Volatility: While preferred stock offers a fixed dividend, the company’s underlying health and ability to pay that dividend are heavily influenced by the volatile price of Bitcoin, which constitutes a significant portion of its assets. Investors interested in this specific MicroStrategy investment should carefully review the official offering documents once they are released to understand the full terms, conditions, and risks. Potential Impact on MSTR Stock and the Market The issuance of $2.1 billion in preferred stock could have several implications for MicroStrategy’s common stock (MSTR stock) and the broader market: Funding for Bitcoin: If the capital is used to buy more Bitcoin, it reinforces MicroStrategy’s commitment to its Bitcoin strategy and could be seen positively by investors bullish on Bitcoin. Increased demand from MSTR could also have a minor impact on Bitcoin’s price. Increased Leverage: This offering adds another layer of financing to MicroStrategy’s capital structure, increasing its overall leverage. While leverage can amplify gains when asset values rise, it also magnifies losses if asset values decline. Market Perception: A large preferred stock offering with a high dividend yield could be interpreted in different ways by the market. Some may see it as an aggressive, confident move to capitalize on market conditions, while others might view the high yield as indicative of higher risk or a costlier way to raise funds compared to other options. Potential for Future Capital Raises: Success with this offering might pave the way for future similar capital-raising activities. The market’s reaction will depend on the final terms of the offering and the prevailing sentiment towards both MicroStrategy and Bitcoin at the time. Conclusion: A Bold Financial Maneuver MicroStrategy’s reported plan to issue up to $2.1 billion in preferred stock with a 10% dividend is a bold financial maneuver that underscores the company’s unwavering commitment to its Bitcoin strategy. This offering provides MicroStrategy with significant capital to potentially expand its Bitcoin holdings, further solidifying its position as a unique investment vehicle for gaining exposure to the digital asset. For investors, the preferred stock offers a high-yield income opportunity but comes with risks related to MicroStrategy’s leveraged balance sheet and the inherent volatility of Bitcoin. As always, potential investors should conduct thorough due diligence and consider their own risk tolerance and investment goals before participating in such an offering.

2025-05-23T06:41:47.000Z,"London Uber Driver steals $123k in crypto after drugging American Tourist","A U.S. tourist was drugged and robbed in London by an Uber driver who made off with $123,000 in cryptocurrency. According to local media , the victim, 30-year-old Jacob Irwin-Cline, was visiting the UK on a short layover when the incident occurred. After a night out in Soho, he called an Uber to return to his hostel, but instead, he ended up getting into a different vehicle with a driver who appeared to match the profile shown in his app. Cline told reporters that the driver, who introduced himself as “Mohammed,” flagged him down using the name saved in the Uber app and seemed friendly enough to gain his trust. The vehicle, however, didn’t match the make and model listed on Cline’s phone. Once inside, the driver offered him a cigarette that Cline now believes was laced with a powerful sedative. He said he quickly became disoriented and passed out, waking up later to find himself on the street, his phone, which held access to his crypto wallets, gone. You might also like: Sui-based Cetus Protocol offers $6M bounty to hacker after $223M exploit Cline confirmed the $123,000 loss, stating that despite reaching out to the FBI’s cybercrime unit, he holds little hope of recovering the funds. The incident adds to a troubling trend of crypto-related crimes targeting unsuspecting investors and tourists. As the popularity of digital assets continues to grow, so too do the risks for those holding substantial amounts on mobile wallets or unsecured devices. Just weeks earlier, the father of a crypto exchange founder was kidnapped in France by a criminal gang demanding ransom. In a separate case, the daughter and grandson of Paymium CEO Pierre Noizat were the victims of an attempted abduction in broad daylight in Paris. It prompted French authorities to roll out special protections for crypto professionals and their families, including priority police access and home security checks, following a spate of similar attacks. Meanwhile, in the U.S., three teens in Florida reportedly kidnapped a man after a crypto event in Las Vegas, forcing him to transfer millions in digital assets before abandoning him in the desert.

2025-05-23T06:41:32.000Z,"OKX Launches xBTC on Aptos Blockchain to Enhance Bitcoin-Backed DeFi","OKX, a blockchain technology company that also operates one of the largest crypto exchanges globally, is launching xBTC, a wrapped version of bitcoin (BTC) on the layer-1 blockchain Aptos. According to a press release sent to CryptoPotato , the launch will give Aptos users access to wrapped BTC without any minting or redemption fees required. OKX Unveils xBTC on Aptos xBTC is backed 1:1 by bitcoins held in OKX’s custody. Starting May 22, Aptos users will be able to mint xBTC on OKX, deposit, or withdraw to the blockchain. They can use the asset across several Aptos-native decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, including trading and lending. This development unlocks new utilities for Bitcoin and Aptos DeFi, as BTC remains the most dominant and trusted cryptocurrency. Aptos Foundation, an organization dedicated to fostering development on the Aptos chain, revealed that the network has a DeFi ecosystem with more than $1 billion in total value locked (TVL). The blockchain has recorded strong momentum behind wrapped BTC assets, as seen in Echo protocol’s aBTC, which boasts over $270 million in TVL. Echo Protocol is a Bitcoin liquid re-staking and yield solutions platform. The foundation believes xBTC will unlock more liquidity, cross-chain interoperability, and access to DeFi protocols in the Aptos ecosystem. Ash Pampati, Head of Ecosystem at Aptos Foundation, said: “Aptos was built for real-world open finance applications, and Bitcoin is the linchpin between traditional and decentralized finance markets. Being one of the first blockchains to support xBTC is a testament to the network’s high performance, security, and scalability. This opens up new avenues for liquidity and ecosystem growth while giving developers the confidence and tools to seize them.” OKX to Launch Special Campaign for xBTC Meanwhile, OKX intends to kickstart a special campaign for xBTC on May 23 to prepare for deeper integrations across the Aptos ecosystem in the coming weeks. The company will partner with Echo Protocol, the decentralized margin trading chain Aries Markets, and the decentralized map ecosystem Hyperion for the campaign. “Delivering seamless usability and access to on-chain use cases is core to what we’ve been building at OKX. By bringing xBTC to Aptos, we are keen to see Bitcoin holders put their BTC to work in fast, low-cost DeFi applications while enjoying the security and transparency they’ve come to expect from us,” said OKX chief innovation officer Jason Lau.

2025-05-23T06:35:44.000Z,"Illicit Bitcoin Service Lands US Man 6-Year Sentence, Must Surrender $1.5M","A Massachusetts man who ran an unlicensed cash-to- Bitcoin operation that prosecutors say facilitated money laundering for scammers and a methamphetamine dealer has been sentenced to six years in federal prison. Trung Nguyen, 48, of Danvers, received the sentence in Boston federal court on Thursday. In addition to the prison term, US District Judge Richard G. Stearns ordered Nguyen to serve 3 years of supervised release and to forfeit over $1.5m in illegal proceeds. Nguyen, who also went by the alias “DCS420,” was convicted in Nov. 2024 of money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. Image Source: DoJ Fake Business Masked $1M Bitcoin Laundering Operation Prosecutors said Nguyen ran his scheme through a company called National Vending, LLC, which he presented as a vending machine business. In reality, it served as a front for a Bitcoin exchange service that bypassed federal anti-money laundering requirements. Between 2017 and 2020, Nguyen converted over $1m in cash to Bitcoin, including $250,000 for someone who told him they were a meth dealer. Under federal law, virtual currency exchangers are classified as money transmitters and must register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN. They are also required to maintain anti-money laundering programs and file reports on large or suspicious transactions. Nguyen did neither, despite handling multiple six-figure sums for clients involved in criminal activity and scams. Federal Jury Found Nguyen Knowingly Bypassed Laws Protecting Fraud Victims The Justice Department revealed that Nguyen processed hundreds of thousands of dollars for romance scam victims. These victims had been tricked into sending Bitcoin to fraudsters overseas. In addition, Nguyen used encrypted messaging to communicate with clients. He also avoided reporting thresholds by breaking up large deposits. Further, he took a course that advised him to create a cover story and never mention Bitcoin. Nguyen was indicted in May 2023 and convicted more than a year later after a federal jury found he deliberately flouted laws designed to prevent financial crimes. Authorities said his actions not only helped criminals hide their tracks, but also put vulnerable victims at further risk. Separately this week, a federal jury in the Eastern District of New York convicted former SafeMoon CEO Braden Karony of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, wire fraud and money laundering. The 12-day trial began on May 5. Karony now faces up to 45 years in prison and the forfeiture of illicit gains.

It’s the country’s only real stock market play on Bitcoin, and right now, it looks like it’s still undervalued—even after a huge recent price jump. According to Richard Byworth , a well-known crypto investor, Metaplanet’s current price is still low compared to the amount of Bitcoin it holds. At $10.82 per share (in its U.S. OTC version, MTPLF), the stock is trading at just over 5 times its net asset value based on Bitcoin holdings. For comparison, MicroStrategy (MSTR), a U.S. company that also holds a lot of Bitcoin, trades at only 1.75 times its Bitcoin value. Short Sellers Are Getting Trapped Metaplanet is the most shorted stock in Japan, with nearly 30% of its shares sold short. But because the stock price has been rising sharply, short sellers are stuck. The stock has hit its daily price limit up for three days in a row on the Tokyo exchange. This means it can’t be sold at a higher price during trading hours, which is making it even harder for shorts to cover their positions. Some short sellers are now facing losses of more than 300%, unable to buy shares back to close their bets. When the limits are lifted, there could be a big price move—known as a short squeeze—that pushes the stock much higher. Strong Bitcoin Buying and Macro Trends Metaplanet has been buying Bitcoin aggressively, giving it a Bitcoin yield that’s over 11 times higher than MicroStrategy’s based on recent purchases. This shows the company is growing its Bitcoin holdings fast. Global bond markets are showing signs of trouble. U.S. and Japanese government bond yields are rising, which often leads central banks to lower rates again. Lower interest rates tend to be good for Bitcoin and related stocks. Why Japanese Investors Like Metaplanet Holding Bitcoin directly in Japan can be expensive because capital gains are taxed as regular income at rates up to 55%. But investing in Metaplanet through Japan’s NISA accounts lets investors avoid capital gains tax on up to about $25,000 a year. This tax advantage is attracting many retail investors in Japan, since Metaplanet is currently the only easy way for them to get exposure to Bitcoin via the stock market. What’s Next for Metaplanet? Byworth suggests that if Metaplanet’s price doubled to around $21, it would be valued similarly to MicroStrategy on a Bitcoin asset basis. Even then, it would still be below its highest valuation in the past. With short sellers stuck and strong buying interest from investors, the stock could see more big moves soon.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/metaplanet-stock-undervalued-despite-bitcoin-surge-says-investor-richard-byworth/,"ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","News|Fintech Company",cryptocompare

An analysis of average daily USD trading volumes for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and XRP across different exchanges reveals an increasing depth in XRP markets. While BTC and ETH dominate overall volume, XRP’s trading activity has become more stable and pronounced. WOW! #XRP MARKET DEPTH SHOWS GROWING MATURITY BEYOND SPECULATIVE BREAKOUT! pic.twitter.com/LModv4pZq3 — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) May 21, 2025 In Amelie, XRP consistently shows sustained volume activity, especially from late 2024 into early 2025, contrasting with the relatively low volume in the months leading up to November 2024. The volume spike began around the time XRP began its remarkable surge. Shortly after former SEC Chair Gary Gensler announced his resignation date in November, the digital asset began climbing, rising consistently until it hit a multi-year peak of $3.39 in January. The chart shows that the digital asset experienced its most notable volume spikes within this period. In early February, XRP took things further, posting its highest volume ever on the 1-hour chart. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Exchange Data Reinforces XRP’s Market Presence The accompanying data table on average daily trading volume by exchange further illustrates XRP’s standing. A crypto researcher recently ranked Coinbase as the top exchange for XRP by trading volume , and Amelie’s chart confirms this, with a volume of $152 million on the exchange. Coinbase takes a substantial portion of the $226.8 million recorded across all listed exchanges, while Kraken follows with $30.8 million. LMAX and Bitstamp contribute $26.4 million and $17.6 million, respectively. Compared to BTC and ETH, XRP still trails in total volume. BTC averages $1.997 billion per day across the included exchanges, and ETH averages $952.5 million. However, the proportion of XRP volume to total activity, particularly on exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken, points to growing investor engagement with the asset. Amelie pointed out that XRP’s expansion is not driven solely by speculative surges. Instead, the data suggests a shift toward more measured and sustained trading behavior. The asset is currently trading at $2.4, and has a 24-hour volume of $3.94 billion, up 35.64% from yesterday, reinforcing the increasing investor participation.

In his statement on his social media account, Krüger drew attention to two important developments behind this rising expectation. First of all, Krüger stated that the $5 billion FTX distribution planned to take place on May 30 could provide significant momentum to the market, and drew attention to the fact that this time, major creditors will receive payment. He stated that this development could be a positive catalyst in the market. On the other hand, Krüger stated that the 90-day customs duty postponement, which will end on July 9, could put pressure on the market, and said, “Depending on the news flow from the White House, markets may start to worry about customs duties again 2-3 weeks in advance.” Related News: A Turning Point for Bitcoin in Europe: A Company Announces It Has Purchased BTC On the other hand, another analyst, Joao Wedson, argued that explaining the recent price movements with institutional demand discourse could be misleading.

2025-05-23T06:00:19.000Z,"BitLemons ($BLEM) Leads 2025 Crypto Surge: BTC Eyes $126K While ETH Rallies 13% – Could This GambleFi Token Deliver the Year’s Biggest Returns?","By Marketpulse on February 22, 2025 | Market Insights The cryptocurrency market is heating up as Bitcoin pushes toward $126K and Ethereum posts impressive gains, but savvy investors are turning their attention to an emerging GambleFi powerhouse that’s already raised over $2 million and shows no signs of slowing down. While established giants battle for market dominance, BitLemons ($BLEM) is quietly positioning itself to capture a massive slice of the $450 billion traditional casino market. With dual security audits, a fully operational revenue-generating platform, and a deflationary tokenomics model that would make any investor’s mouth water, BitLemons represents the kind of early-stage opportunity that creates generational wealth. As Stage 3 of the presale rapidly fills at just $0.03 per token, the question isn’t whether you should invest—it’s whether you can afford not to. Can Bitcoin Sustain Its Push Toward $126K Despite Market Volatility? Bitcoin’s recent reclaim of the $110K psychological barrier has reignited institutional enthusiasm and retail investor confidence alike. The world’s flagship cryptocurrency is displaying textbook bullish behavior, with analysts drawing trend lines directly toward the $118K and $126K resistance zones. This momentum surge comes as macroeconomic factors align favorably, with increasing corporate treasury allocations and regulatory clarity providing sustainable tailwinds. The technical picture for Bitcoin over the past seven days reveals a story of steady accumulation and controlled volatility. Trading volume has increased by approximately 18% week-over-week, while the 20-day exponential moving average maintains its upward trajectory. The RSI sits comfortably in positive territory without approaching overbought levels, suggesting room for continued upward movement. Key support has been established around the $109,588 level, with resistance targets clearly defined at $118K and the psychological $126K zone. Is Ethereum’s 13% Surge Against Bitcoin Signaling an Altcoin Season Revival? Ethereum’s impressive performance against Bitcoin has caught the attention of seasoned traders who recognize this type of relative strength as a potential harbinger of broader altcoin momentum. The ETH/BTC pair’s 13% surge represents more than just a technical bounce—it signals a fundamental shift in market flows as investors rotate capital toward assets with higher growth potential. This rotation pattern historically precedes significant altcoin rallies that can dwarf Bitcoin’s gains. Ethereum’s seven-day price action tells a compelling story of sustained buying pressure and institutional accumulation. The network’s native token has demonstrated remarkable resilience, with trading volumes increasing by 22% compared to the previous week. Technical analysis reveals a clear break above the $2,600 resistance level, with momentum indicators suggesting further upside potential toward the $2,800-$3,000 range. Support levels have been firmly established around $2,400, providing a solid foundation for continued advancement. Why Are Smart Money Investors Flooding Into BitLemons While Others Chase Established Names? BitLemons ($BLEM) represents the convergence of two unstoppable forces: the explosive growth of cryptocurrency adoption and the massive, largely untapped potential of online gaming revenues. While Bitcoin and Ethereum battle for incremental market share gains, BitLemons is pioneering an entirely new category within the GambleFi space, backed by a fully functional crypto casino generating revenue around the clock with over 8,000 games from premium providers like Evolution and Pragmatic. The numbers behind BitLemons’ presale success tell a story that would make even the most skeptical investor take notice. Stage 1 sold out in just 16 days, Stage 2 followed suit completely, and Stage 3 is already 11.23% filled with tokens priced at just $0.03. The project has secured dual security audits from SpyWolf and SolidProof—a level of validation that separates serious projects from speculative ventures. With $1 million raised in the private seed round and over $2 million total funding secured, momentum continues accelerating as each of the 13 presale stages brings higher prices, starting from $0.01 and increasing by $0.01 per stage. Could BitLemons’ Revolutionary Tokenomics Model Redefine Passive Income in Crypto? The genius of BitLemons lies not just in its market timing, but in its sophisticated approach to value creation through tokenomics that reward holders while systematically reducing supply. The project allocates 30% of Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) directly to token mechanics: 15% funds aggressive buyback and burn programs that create deflationary pressure, while another 15% provides staking rewards that generate passive income for holders. This dual-mechanism approach ensures that as the platform grows and generates more revenue, token holders benefit through both price appreciation and direct distributions. Market whispers suggest a potential listing price between $0.17-$0.18, representing substantial upside from current Stage 3 pricing of $0.03. Unlike speculative projects that promise future utility, BitLemons delivers immediate value through its operational casino platform that never sleeps, generating revenue 24/7 from a global user base. The deflationary supply model, combined with high-yield staking opportunities and revenue-driven rewards, creates a perfect storm for sustained price appreciation that traditional cryptocurrencies simply cannot match. The Writing Is On The Wall: Why BitLemons Could Eclipse Both Bitcoin and Ethereum Returns in 2025 While Bitcoin eyes $126K targets and Ethereum rallies against its digital gold counterpart, the real opportunity lies in identifying the next breakthrough project before mainstream adoption. BitLemons ($BLEM) combines the best elements of DeFi innovation with real-world revenue generation, positioning early investors to capitalize on both the cryptocurrency boom and the explosive growth of online gaming. With institutional-grade security audits, a proven revenue model, and tokenomics designed to reward long-term holders, BitLemons represents the type of asymmetric opportunity that defines portfolio-changing investments. The clock is ticking as Stage 3 fills rapidly and the next price increase looms on the horizon. Every day that passes brings BitLemons closer to its anticipated exchange listings, where early investors will likely see their patience rewarded with substantial returns. Don’t let this incredible seed entry opportunity slip away while chasing the incremental gains of established cryptocurrencies. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of BitLemons ($BLEM) Presale Today!

2025-05-23T06:00:15.000Z,"Bitcoin Exchange Activity Declines Sharply Since July 2022 – Accumulation Or Apathy?","Bitcoin is trading above all-time highs once again, having surged past the $110,000 mark just hours ago. The breakout signals strong bullish momentum as BTC enters a fresh price discovery phase. Investor sentiment remains upbeat, with many analysts speculating on how far this rally could extend. While some foresee an extended bull run powered by macro trends and institutional flows, others caution that overheated levels could trigger sharp pullbacks. One critical piece of data drawing attention comes from CryptoQuant: since the collapse of Luna in 2022, average weekly trading volumes for the BTC/USD pair on centralized exchanges (CEXs) have sharply declined. From a peak of 2.9 million BTC traded weekly in July 2022, volumes have fallen to just 426,000 BTC as of yesterday’s session. This drop in exchange activity suggests two key dynamics. First, a reduced supply of BTC on exchanges often correlates with long-term holding behavior, typically a bullish signal. Second, lower sell-side liquidity may increase volatility, especially in the face of rapid price movements. As Bitcoin continues its upward march, the absence of significant volume on CEXs could either accelerate gains or magnify corrections depending on investor reaction in the days ahead. Bitcoin Low Exchange Volume Adds Fuel To Bullish Outlook Bitcoin is showing resilience in the face of macroeconomic headwinds. While U.S. equities dipped yesterday due to rising yields in Treasury Bonds, Bitcoin climbed steadily, signaling that market participants may be rotating capital into hard assets amid uncertainty. This relative strength highlights BTC’s appeal as a hedge, particularly when traditional markets waver. However, despite the bullish momentum, a key hurdle remains at the $115,000 level. Breaking above this resistance would confirm the next phase of the rally and open the door to higher price discovery. Conversely, a failure to hold above current levels around $110,000 could invite a swift correction back to previous support zones. Traders are watching closely, as volatility could rise quickly. Top analyst Axel Adler added meaningful context to the broader trend. According to Adler , after the Luna collapse in 2022, weekly trading volumes for the BTC/USD pair on centralized exchanges (CEXs) have plummeted—from 2.9 million BTC in July 2022 to just 426,000 BTC this week. This long-term decline in exchange activity is viewed as a bullish structural shift. It signals a move toward long-term holding behavior and a tightening of available supply. With fewer coins circulating on exchanges, sell-side pressure is reduced, creating a supportive backdrop for continued upward price action. BTC Price Action Shows Strong Momentum Bitcoin is trading at $110,855 after briefly reaching $111,163, signaling strong upward momentum and continuation of the bullish trend. On the 4-hour chart, BTC has consistently posted higher lows and higher highs since the bounce off the $100K support level on May 15. The recent breakout above the $108K resistance level triggered a surge in buying volume, pushing BTC into uncharted territory. Key technical indicators support the bullish bias. The 200-period simple moving average (SMA) at $98,024 and the 200-period exponential moving average (EMA) at $98,826 are trending upward, confirming strong underlying trend support. Volume spikes in the last two sessions also suggest strong conviction from buyers as BTC entered price discovery. However, the price is beginning to show signs of potential exhaustion. The latest candles exhibit long wicks on the upper side, hinting at selling pressure near local highs. If BTC fails to maintain momentum, a retest of the $108K breakout level could occur. Immediate support lies around $103,600, with $100K as the psychological floor.

2025-05-23T05:35:08.000Z,"CME Group Fuels XRP ETF Hope","Levi Rietveld, a respected crypto analyst and founder of Crypto Crusaders, has commented on the strong performance of XRP futures since their debut on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). In a recent post , he noted that the contracts are doing exceptionally, noting that they have pulled in almost $30 million since the launch. He also pointed to the growing interest as a possible catalyst for regulatory movement on a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). With over ten XRP spot ETF applications pending, the success and appeal of the futures contracts may influence the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) stance. Strong Early Trading Points to Institutional Demand CME’s XRP futures officially launched on May 19 , including standard-sized (50,000 XRP) and micro (2,500 XRP) contracts. These contracts are cash-settled in U.S. dollars and based on the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate, which is calculated daily. The first day alone saw about $19 million in trades , while the second day added another $7 million. These figures signal substantial institutional engagement, placing XRP alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana as the only cryptocurrencies with futures contracts on CME. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The fast increase in volume suggests that XRP is increasingly seen as a viable asset in institutional portfolios. The regulated environment provided by CME offers a compliant gateway for exposure to XRP price movements, especially for firms that do not wish to hold the underlying token directly. The Path to Spot XRP ETFs The performance of the CME XRP futures has direct implications for broader regulatory developments, particularly the potential approval of a spot XRP ETF. Levi highlighted this connection, pointing out that the strong institutional demand has renewed speculation about ETFs. The swift institutional uptake in a regulated setting may strengthen the case for the SEC to approve such products. The fact that more than ten applications for spot XRP ETFs are pending further supports the notion that the market is actively preparing for such a shift. Historically, futures have played a role in ETF approval decisions, and experts have previously pointed to the lack of XRP futures as a reason why ETFs would not be approved . Bitcoin and Ethereum futures were established on CME before spot ETFs were approved in the U.S., and XRP may follow a similar trajectory if current trading patterns remain consistent.

2025-05-23T05:32:02.000Z,"BITCOIN PRICE ANALYSIS & PREDICTION (May 23) – BTC Hits New All-Time High Following 30% Increases in a Month","Following a consistent recovery from a broad corrective phase, Bitcoin finally reached a new milestone today after over 30 days of trading. This came as a result of a major price break as bigger moves lie ahead. The recent rally in Bitcoin was initiated last month after recovering from a short-term correction level of $74.5k. This brought a renewed hope for the bulls as the price closed well at around $97k – above March’s high. Due to a rejection, it pulled back slightly earlier this month and bounced back with a major surge above the crucial $100k level in the first week. Consolidating throughout last week with a strong close above $109.5k, it recovered fully to the top following a steady increase in demand. Breaking to a new all-time high today, Bitcoin just hinted a new macro bullish wave, and from the look of things, altcoins are expected to follow suit once it suspends the latest surge into a consolidation mode. However, it is important to note that bigger moves lie ahead for the giant crypto in the long-term as long as capital continues to flow well into the market. In fact, with the latest market sentiments and speculations, coupled with some strong fundamentals surround the market, BTC may end this cycle at around $140k. BTC’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Anticipating more surges above the current high of $111,888, the $115k and $120k levels would be the next bulls’ target in the coming days. The previously broken all-time high of $109,588 now acts as support for the primary cryptocurrency. Below it lies $106,457. If all these supports fail in a pullback, it may revisit the $100,718 level before rebounding. Key Resistance Levels: $111,888, $115,000, $120,000 Key Support Levels: $109,588, $106,457, 100,718 Spot Price: $110,756 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

2025-05-23T05:30:00.000Z,"Tourist Loses $123K in Bitcoin in London as Crypto Criminal Activity Surges","A disturbing robbery in London and a major sentencing in Boston this week have drawn attention to the expanding threat landscape surrounding cryptocurrency. In the UK, an American tourist was reportedly drugged with a powerful sedative and robbed of $123,000 in Bitcoin after mistaking a fake taxi driver for his Uber ride. The attacker fled with the victim’s smartphone, which held the private keys to his crypto wallet. Just days earlier in the United States, a Massachusetts man was sentenced to six years in federal prison for running a covert Bitcoin exchange masked as a vending machine company, laundering over $1 million in cash linked to scams and drug deals. Crypto Crime Wave Reaches London: American Tourist Drugged and Robbed of $123K in Bitcoin In a chilling reminder of the real-world risks tied to digital assets, an American tourist visiting the United Kingdom fell victim to a crypto-targeted mugging that left him without $123,000 in Bitcoin. The victim, identified as Jacob Irwin-Cline, recounted the traumatic ordeal to My London, revealing a sophisticated scheme involving impersonation, drugging, and digital theft. The incident began after Cline spent an evening at a bar in London. Slightly intoxicated, he ordered an Uber to take him back to his accommodation. However, instead of verifying the license plate or vehicle description, he mistakenly entered a different car driven by a man who resembled the expected Uber driver but was operating a private, unregistered vehicle. Jacob Irwin-Cline (Source: My London) What followed was a disturbing sequence of events that has raised alarm bells in both the tourism and crypto communities. According to Cline, the impersonating driver offered him a cigarette shortly after entering the vehicle. The seemingly innocent gesture turned dangerous when Cline began to feel overwhelmingly drowsy. Within minutes, Cline lost consciousness for what he estimates was approximately half an hour. By the time he regained awareness, the situation had spiraled out of control. The driver demanded that he exit the car. As Cline stepped out, the vehicle abruptly accelerated, clipping him in the process and fleeing the scene with his smartphone. The phone was not just a communication device, it also contained access to Cline’s Bitcoin wallet. His private keys, stored on the device without additional cold storage backups or multi-factor authentication, gave the thief immediate access to the $123,000 in crypto assets. Cline’s case is not isolated. It comes amid a troubling wave of violent incidents targeting crypto investors, executives, and their families. Criminals appear to be evolving their methods to exploit the growing number of individuals with significant digital holdings. Earlier this month in France, the father of a crypto exchange owner was rescued from captivity by French police, who uncovered an organized ransom operation. The unidentified exchange executive’s family was reportedly being targeted for the crypto ransom, and law enforcement intervention was critical in preventing a potentially tragic outcome. Just days later, Pierre Noizat, CEO of Paris-based crypto exchange Paymium, confirmed that his daughter and grandson were victims of an attempted kidnapping in broad daylight. The assailants, masked and coordinated, tried to force the family into a nearby vehicle before being repelled by the daughter and another individual on-site. These events have put pressure on governments, exchanges, and the broader crypto ecosystem to rethink security standards—both digital and physical. A Call for Better Personal Security With the line between virtual wealth and real-world vulnerability continuing to blur, experts are urging individuals with substantial crypto holdings to implement stronger operational security (OpSec) protocols. This includes storing private keys in cold wallets, using multi-signature access, and avoiding sharing wealth-related information in public forums or social settings. The UK incident also raises questions about platform accountability. Ride-sharing companies like Uber have invested in safety features such as license plate verification and driver identity checks. However, this incident illustrates the dangers of noncompliance on the user side, especially when impaired or distracted. London’s Metropolitan Police have yet to make a public statement about Cline’s case but are reportedly investigating the theft. Authorities have urged tourists and residents to remain vigilant, particularly when accessing high-value accounts on mobile devices while traveling. Meanwhile, crypto platforms are being encouraged to enforce stronger security measures, including default 2FA (two-factor authentication) and enhanced alerts when access from a new device is detected. Crypto Wealth is No Longer Anonymous Cline’s experience sheds light on the hard truth that crypto wealth, once considered pseudonymous and secure, can now make individuals a high-profile target in both the digital and physical world. Social media posts, exchange account leaks, and even blockchain explorer data can hint at wallet balances and attract malicious actors. As of this writing, Cline’s stolen Bitcoin has not been recovered. Blockchain forensic firms have been contacted to trace the funds, but analysts warn that once a phone is compromised and access keys are exported or transferred, real-time recovery becomes increasingly difficult. Massachusetts Man Sentenced to 6 Years for Operating Covert Bitcoin Exchange Disguised as Vending Business In other crypto crime news, a US man accused of running a clandestine Bitcoin exchange under the guise of a vending machine business has been sentenced to six years in federal prison, capping a years-long investigation into what prosecutors called a “no questions asked” crypto conversion service that facilitated drug deals and scams. Trung Nguyen, a resident of Danvers, Massachusetts, was sentenced by US District Court Judge Richard Stearns in a Boston courtroom on May 22. In addition to the prison term, Nguyen will serve three years of supervised release and must forfeit $1.5 million in illegal proceeds. Nguyen’s business, which operated under the name National Vending, processed more than $1 million in cash-for- Bitcoin transactions between September 2017 and October 2020, according to prosecutors. But beneath the surface, the business was anything but ordinary vending operations. Prosecutors say Trung Nguyen operated a fake vending machine business. (Source: Pacer ) Authorities revealed that Nguyen took part in an online course designed to teach individuals how to evade banking scrutiny and regulatory detection. These lessons included tips on avoiding words like “Bitcoin” in business paperwork, creating fictional supplier lists, and camouflaging illicit financial flows through legitimate-sounding fronts. According to federal filings, Nguyen’s services attracted a diverse and questionable clientele. Among them were victims of overseas romance and tech scams, who were coerced into converting cash into Bitcoin on behalf of fraudsters. In one particularly damning example, Nguyen facilitated ten transactions totaling $250,000 for a known drug dealer in 2018. At the heart of the prosecution was Nguyen’s decision to run a money-transmitting business without registering with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which is a requirement under federal anti-money laundering (AML) laws. Prosecutors alleged that Nguyen willfully ignored AML rules, failing to file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) or Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs) even when processing large sums of cash exceeding $10,000—transactions that would typically be red-flagged by compliant financial institutions. Instead, Nguyen structured deposits by breaking up large cash sums into smaller amounts spread across multiple days and different bank branches, which is a tactic commonly known as “smurfing,” that is used to avoid triggering regulatory alerts. Sting Operation and Conviction Nguyen’s downfall came via a sting operation in which undercover law enforcement officers posed as clients. During several meetings, Nguyen accepted bundles of cash and returned Bitcoin while charging a commission of around 5%. He communicated through encrypted messaging platforms and reportedly used advanced privacy technologies to obscure transaction trails on the blockchain. Despite initially pleading not guilty in June 2023, Nguyen was convicted in November 2024 on one count of operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business and one count of money laundering. He was acquitted on a second money laundering charge. National Vending: A Case Study in Modern Financial Deception National Vending functioned for three years without detection by disguising its true nature. Banks processed Nguyen’s structured deposits under the assumption that they were revenue from vending operations. Crypto exchanges received fiat deposits that Nguyen claimed were business expenses. In reality, authorities said, Nguyen was functioning as a shadow exchange and turning hard cash into untraceable cryptocurrency for anyone willing to pay his commission and ask no questions. With Nguyen’s sentencing, regulators may further accelerate crackdowns on peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto exchangers and unlicensed brokers. Legal experts believe that authorities could increase enforcement actions in the coming year by leveraging blockchain analysis tools and undercover agents. While centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken have long operated under regulatory oversight, decentralized and informal conversion services continue to operate in legal gray zones. Nguyen’s prosecution signals that such loopholes are closing.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9235/tourist-loses-123-k-in-bitcoin-in-london-as-crypto-criminal-activity-surges,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

With this, the Ethereum market cap surged above $327 billion and surpassed the market cap of Bank of America for a while. With this, the ETH price is heading towards one of the most bullish monthly closes in the near future. Moreover, the current chart patterns are replicating the Bitcoin 2021 bull run, and hence, if it follows a similar outcome, the ETH price may find highs beyond a 5-digit figure. Following the Pectra upgrade, ETH/BTC has shown huge bullish momentum, rebounding from the key support levels at 0.02. This occurred back in 2020, before the start of the 2021 bull run. This could be the main reason that the 40x Long Whale, James Wynn , opened a long position with 25x leverage in ETH at the entry point of $2666, valued at $60.4 million. Previously, the whale had opened a long position in Bitcoin, which resulted in a massive upswing towards new highs. This suggests that whales have become extremely bullish on Ethereum, indicating that the price of ETH could be poised for a significant upswing. After facing equal bullish and bearish action throughout the past week, the ETH price has finally triggered a strong breakout, which could push the price beyond the multi-year ascending trend line. Moreover, the weekly price action suggests the token is testing the 200-day MA, and a rise above the range could be the turning point for the second-largest token. Currently, the price is testing the neckline of the v-shaped recovery and hence a weekly close above $2,619 may ascertain the beginning of the fresh bullish action. The weekly RSI is rising, the weekly MACD underwent a bullish crossover, and the weekly CMF is at 0 after a rebound from -0.11, but the weekly DMI displays a diverse movement. On the other hand, the Ethereum Open Interest has surged above $33 billion, suggesting a significant rise in the open futures and option contracts, which signals fresh liquidity entering the space. After Bitcoin, it’s now time for Ethereum to break the highs, which may further trigger a strong altseason as Bitcoin dominance continues to drop.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/ethereum-open-interest-hits-new-highs-heres-why-eth-price-is-poised-for-a-50-surge/,"BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX","Price Analysis|Ethereum",cryptocompare

Bitcoin ( BTC ) futures open interest reached a peak of just over $80 billion on May 23, according to CoinGlass. It’s an increase of 30% since the start of May as derivatives speculators load up on leverage in anticipation of higher Bitcoin prices. Open interest is the total number of outstanding futures contracts that allow traders to bet on the future price of Bitcoin, which have not been settled or closed, showing the total amount of current market speculation. Total Bitcoin futures OI. Source: Coinglass When OI surges, it indicates massive leveraged positions are built up in the market, with lots of traders holding large positions with borrowed money. If Bitcoin’s price moves against these over-leveraged positions, traders get forcibly liquidated, and the flushout can create selling pressure on Bitcoin, which can cause a rapid drop in prices and high volatility. However, analysts suggest the surge in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows, which have seen more than $2.5 billion this week, can counter some of that extended leverage. Related: Crypto perp futures coming ‘very soon,’ says CFTC’s Mersinger Bitcoin options markets show a similar pattern with open interest over $1.5 billion at the $110,000 and $120,000 strike prices on the Deribit exchange. There is also more than $1 billion in OI at strike prices of $115,000, $125,000, and $130,000. Around $2.76 billion worth of notional value contracts are due to expire on May 23 with a put/call ratio of 1.2%, meaning there are more short (put) sellers than longs (call), and a max pain point of $103,000, where most losses will be made on expiry, according to Deribit.

Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $112,000 on May 22 and had mostly traded just above $111,000 over the last 24 hours, but had again slipped below the level at 4:15 am UTC on May 23.

2025-05-23T05:04:51.000Z,"Crypto Dinner at Trump Resort Draws Protesters Backlash","Roughly 100 demonstrators gathered outside the Trump National Golf Club in Virginia on Thursday evening as guests arrived for the Trump Crypto Dinner, a private event celebrating top investors in President Trump’s $TRUMP cryptocurrency. The event, held behind closed doors and not listed on the public schedule, was marketed as one of the most exclusive crypto gatherings in the world, drawing backlash over its secretive nature and high-dollar access. According to The Independent and Bloomberg , protesters held signs reading “America is not for sale” and “Stop Crypto Corruption” while chanting “Shame!” as attendees emerged from their cars near the club’s security checkpoint. Some shouted, “I hope you choke on your dinner,” while others carried props, including a gold coin with Trump’s face and placards demanding the guest list be made public. On my way to Trump dinner @GetTrumpMemes pic.twitter.com/CInPrawsvI — H.E. Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) May 22, 2025 Decor, Gifts and Gourmet Fare Marked Trump’s Crypto Dinner The dinner welcomed the top 220 holders of the $TRUMP memecoin , a token launched earlier this year and controlled primarily by the Trump Organization and its affiliates. Access to the event was based on a leaderboard. It tracked token holdings over a three-week period. As a result, the top 25 investors received additional privileges. These included a private cocktail reception with Trump earlier in the evening. Bloomberg reported that the dinner hall featured signs that read “Fight Fight Fight.” These referenced the company behind the meme coin. Additionally, guests received gift bags with branded hats and plaques. Meanwhile, the menu included salad, filet mignon, pan-seared halibut, and warm lava cake. The guest list featured several public figures. These included former NBA player Lamar Odom and crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun . Notably, Sun is currently resolving a regulatory case in the US. He posted a photo of himself on the way to the dinner on X. Trump also promoted the evening on Truth Social, claiming, “The U.S.A. is DOMINATING in Crypto, Bitcoin, etc., and we are going to keep it that way!” Warren Decries Trump Crypto Gathering as Corrupt and Ethically Fraught The event has sparked sharp criticism from Democratic lawmakers. Sen. Elizabeth Warren called it “an orgy of corruption ,” pointing to recent policy shifts under the Trump administration. These include the dismantling of the Justice Department’s crypto enforcement unit and changes at the SEC. She and others have warned that such gatherings blur ethical lines and risk selling influence to wealthy individuals, including those outside the US. The White House released a vague schedule showing Trump would stay at the club until around 8:30 p.m. EDT. However, it confirmed the event was closed to the press. Despite the mounting scrutiny, the dinner appears to have marked another attempt by Trump to fuse political capital with personal digital ventures.

2025-05-23T05:00:10.000Z,"XRP’s 3.3% Weekly Gain Encouraging — Yet MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Explosive Potential Keeps It in Focus","Bitcoin (BTC) continues to anchor the crypto market, trading above $106,000 with forecasts pointing to $116,000–$137,000 by late May 2025. Institutional inflows and ETF adoption remain robust, giving BTC a solid foundation for the next leg up. However, as Bitcoin’s momentum steadies, savvy investors are increasingly rotating capital into altcoins with higher upside—especially early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the risk/reward profile is drawing aggressive capital rotation. This shift is positioning MAGA as a primary beneficiary of the current bull cycle’s capital flow. XRP: Bullish Momentum, But Limited Multiples XRP has climbed 3.3% this week, now trading at $2.35 after surging more than 300% since late 2024 3 . The token’s rally is fueled by regulatory clarity, the launch of CME-regulated XRP futures, and growing speculation around a spot ETF. Analysts are forecasting a move to $2.80–$3.40 by June, with $4.50 as an optimistic scenario for 2025. However, with XRP’s price action now consolidating in a narrow range and some technical indicators flashing caution, many traders are diversifying into early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE to maximize portfolio growth potential. While XRP’s outlook is bullish, the magnitude of its next leg may pale in comparison to what’s possible with MAGA’s explosive setup. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Breakout Presale With 30x–50x Upside MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing the spotlight as 2025’s leading presale, with over $8 million raised and a confirmed listing price of $0.007. The project’s scarcity-driven model, Hashex-audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling unprecedented demand. Analysts are projecting 30x–50x returns for early buyers, and some models suggest a $1 target within 12–18 months—a potential 375,000% gain from the current presale price. With Stage 8 nearly full and a limited-time 50% bonus for early buyers using the promo code MAGA50X , MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the only major altcoin still in true accumulation mode before listings. As capital rotates from established giants to breakout contenders, MAGA’s momentum and asymmetric upside are making it the top altcoin to watch for Q3 2025. Polkadot: Quiet Growth, But MAGA Steals the Show Polkadot (DOT) is holding steady around $7.50, with steady development and ecosystem expansion. While DOT remains a dependable hold for long-term investors, its near-term upside is less dramatic compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. As traders seek sharper returns, MAGA’s early-stage appeal and viral narrative are making it the go-to allocation for those chasing the next 30x–50x winner. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Conclusion XRP’s 3.3% weekly gain is encouraging and Bitcoin’s macro strength is clear, but MAGACOIN FINANCE’s explosive presale potential and 30x–50x analyst forecasts are keeping it firmly in the spotlight. With Stage 8 nearly full, a $0.007 listing target, and a 50% bonus for early buyers using MAGA50X , MAGA offers a rare chance to secure ground-floor exposure before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery. For those seeking the next supercycle winner, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the name on every smart investor’s radar.

A new report by The Wall Street Journal reveals that JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo are exploring a joint stablecoin initiative, one that could transform traditional banking’s approach to digital money and challenge the dominance of crypto-native platforms. Breaking: @WSJ front page – Big Banks Explore Venturing Into Crypto World Together With Joint #Stablecoin The discussions involve payments companies co-owned by @jpmorgan @Chase . The conversations have so far involved companies co-owned by JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America… pic.twitter.com/HzmS6PsvB8 — MartyParty (@martypartymusic) May 23, 2025 US Banks Push for Regulated Stablecoin Leading US financial institutions are in early talks to develop a stablecoin through two key entities: Early Warning Services (EWS) and The Clearing House (TCH). Both are jointly owned by a consortium of major banks. EWS runs Zelle, the popular peer-to-peer payment network , while TCH powers real-time interbank payments. This initiative signals a significant shift in banking strategy, no longer ignoring the digital asset trend but actively building infrastructure to compete with it. Regulatory Clarity Could Accelerate Stablecoin Development A crucial element for the stablecoin project’s success lies in regulatory clarity. The GENIUS Act, short for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, could become the legal foundation for such initiatives. The bill recently passed a procedural Senate hurdle and, if fully approved, would allow both banks and nonbanks to issue stablecoins under a regulated framework. For the banks, this could mean a clear path to create and distribute dollar-backed digital assets legally and securely, opening the door to broader institutional adoption . JPMorgan and Wells Fargo Lead the Way JPMorgan has already launched its digital dollar, JPM Coin, to move money within its system. Wells Fargo has tested a similar version called Wells Fargo Digital Cash for use in cross-border payments and internal transfers. Meanwhile, Bank of America hasn’t rolled one out yet, but its CEO says they’re ready to go, as soon as the rules allow it. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : U.S. SEC Delays Decision-Making on More Crypto ETFs Led by XRP and Litecoin , Crypto-Native Firms Target Banking Status While traditional banks warm up to blockchain , crypto-native firms like Circle, BitGo, Paxos, and Coinbase also advance toward full-scale banking roles. With President Trump’s return and his pro-crypto stance , promising to make the US a “Bitcoin superpower,” these firms are again finding room to grow after years of regulatory headwinds. Some, like BitGo, are reportedly preparing to apply for bank charters while managing reserves for stablecoins like USD1 , tied to a venture from the Trump family. As big banks turn to blockchain and crypto firms try to go mainstream, stablecoins are becoming the next big thing. If banks launch their digital dollar, it could change how money moves and bring traditional finance closer to crypto. But it all depends on rules, demand, and how fast they can act. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

With fresh momentum building, analysts are eyeing a surge toward $3.33 in the short term, with even higher targets going further. Analyst Targets $3.33 Short Term Analyst Dark Defender , in his latest analysis, has observed that XRP has flashed a rare Golden Cross signal on the weekly RSI. This could launch XRP toward $3.33 soon, with a higher target set at $5.85. These targets are part of a bigger bullish trend that is expected to unfold soon. As Bitcoin continues to make new all-time highs, Investor Paul Barron believes that the rising wave could lift XRP as well, which could target $4 next. XRP Forms First Golden Cross vs. Bitcoin in 4 Years XRP recently formed a golden cross against Bitcoin on the weekly chart for the first time in four years. This happens when the 50-week moving average crosses above the 200-week moving average, which hints at a possible bull run against XRP after staying flat for four years. XRP is building pressure for a big move, followed by a sharp breakout in either direction. With RSI near 60, it has plenty of room for upside movements. On the upside, its targets include $2.68, $2.95, and $3.39, with $3.87. But if it loses support at $2.30, then it could slide back to $2.26 or $2.10, losing its long-term support zone. Bullish Technical Indicators with Some Mixed Signals XRP’s technical indicators show mixed signals but are mostly positive. MACD shows some selling pressure while the RSI is neutral at 58. Major moving averages from 10-200 periods show strong buy momentum and an overall bullish trend. It is currently trading at $2.47, up over 2% in the past day. Recent reports from Messari point that XRP is showing strong growth, with its market cap up 2% this quarter, while BTC, ETH, and SOL dropped 22%. Year-over-year, XRP’s market cap climbed by 252%. Network activity is booming too, as daily active addresses jumped 142% and new addresses rose 210% compared to last year.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-flashes-bullish-signal-after-200-days-price-targets-3-33/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, scarcity-driven tokenomics, and HashEx-audited contracts are fueling unprecedented demand, with analysts forecasting 35x–50x returns as conservative, and some models projecting up to 18,500% upside if momentum continues. MAGA’s political meme narrative and viral community engagement have made it the #1 presale of the year, outpacing even the most established tokens in terms of investor enthusiasm and momentum. With a $0.007 listing target on the horizon and a limited-time 50% bonus for early buyers using the promo code PATRIOT50X , MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the only major altcoin still in true accumulation mode before listings—offering the highest risk-adjusted upside window heading into Q3. Ethereum: Whale Accumulation and Bullish Catalysts Ethereum (ETH) has climbed 4.5% in recent weeks, trading near $2,489 and showing renewed strength as whales accumulate millions of tokens in anticipation of network upgrades and a proposed 100x gas limit increase. Analysts expect that if historical trends repeat, ETH could surge toward $2,300–$2,700 in the near term, with the EIP 9698 proposal and ETF speculation providing additional bullish catalysts. While Ethereum remains the backbone of DeFi and Web3, its size and maturity mean that the most aggressive capital is now rotating into earlier-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the risk/reward profile is far more compelling for those seeking transformative returns. XRP: Institutional Momentum, But MAGA Steals the Spotlight XRP is trading between $2.33 and $2.65, with whale accumulation and regulatory clarity supporting its price. Analysts forecast a move to $5.50 by December 2025 and $10–$20 by 2030 if global adoption and ETF approvals accelerate. While XRP’s upside is steady, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s early-stage momentum and 35x–50x growth model are attracting traders seeking faster, higher-multiple returns before listings go live. Bitcoin and Injective: Solid Foundations, But Capital Rotates Bitcoin (BTC) is consolidating above $110,000, providing a strong macro anchor for the market, while Injective (INJ) continues to build in the DeFi space. However, as capital rotates for higher multiples, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale structure and viral narrative are making it the go-to allocation for those chasing the next 25x–50x winner. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW Conclusion Ethereum’s 4.5% gain is a clear sign of market optimism, but the most compelling opportunity of 2025 may be MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 nearly full, a locked-in $0.007 listing target, and a 50% bonus for early buyers using PATRIOT50X , MAGA offers a rare ground-floor entry before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery. For those seeking the next supercycle winner, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the name topping every analyst’s watchlist.

2025-05-23T04:01:39.000Z,"Ethereum Price Could Surge to $3,200 as CME Futures Gaps Remain Unfilled","Ethereum (ETH) is showing strong momentum amid rising trading volumes, bullish community sentiment, and technical patterns hinting at a potential breakout to $3,200. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has been on a tear lately, climbing 5.6% in the last 24 hours to reach $2,666, with a 30-day gain of more than 64%. This surge has reignited discussion around key price targets, particularly two unfilled CME futures gaps near the $3,200 mark. CME Gaps and the $3,200 Target According to pseudonymous crypto trader Titan of Crypto, such gaps “tend to get filled,” implying ETH’s rally might be far from over. The technical rationale behind his claim finds support in historical price behavior, where such voids often act as a magnet for future price action. These differences are usually created when the market starts a new week significantly higher than it closed the previous week. Ethereum, which is currently riding a wave of bullish momentum, appears to be targeting these levels next, provided it can overcome key resistance zones. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe weighed in on May 22, noting that the crypto asset recently cleared the $2,400 resistance zone. “I assume that Ethereum is following Bitcoin and will break to $3,000+,” he said, highlighting the correlation between the two. Nonetheless, some market watchers are arguing caution. As CryptoPotato recently reported, ETH has entered an “ overheated state ” following intense trading activity and profit-taking near $2,600. According to on-chain data from CryptoQuant, the altcoin may face a short-term cooling period before resuming its upward trajectory. Despite the potential pause, there is still strong long-term conviction, with Santiment data showing less than 5% of ETH is now held on centralized exchanges, the lowest level in more than 10 years. Additionally, last week, investment products linked to the token saw inflows worth $205 million , signaling renewed institutional confidence following the Pectra upgrade. Altcoin Season on the Horizon? Meanwhile, the crypto community is buzzing, with YouTuber Crypto Rover linking Ethereum’s latest uptick to an impending altcoin season. Chris Burniske, who formerly headed ARK Invest’s crypto division, also pointed to ETH’s strength against BTC as a trigger for alt rallies. The cryptocurrency’s recent performance shows a 37.4% gain over 14 days, accompanied by a 64% surge in the past month, which still leaves it more than 29% below its all-time high. According to digital asset investor Daan Crypto Trades, Ethereum’s next critical resistance is at $2,850, a level that, if broken, could pave the way for the $3,200 CME gap fill predicted by Titan of Crypto.

2025-05-23T03:50:39.000Z,"Best crypto to buy as BTC closes out Bitcoin Pizza Day with a bang","Bitcoin (BTC) surged to a new all-time high on Thursday, trading above $111,000 for the first time ever as the crypto community celebrated Bitcoin Pizza Day — the anniversary of the first real-world Bitcoin transaction. The milestone marks a decisive breakout, putting the original cryptocurrency in price discovery mode amid a shifting macroeconomic backdrop. At the time of writing on Friday, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap continued to stay above the $111K mark. Bitcoin continues to serve as the bedrock of the crypto market and a store of value during times of economic instability. However, its reduced price swings and rising acceptance among institutional players have made it less compelling for those chasing high-risk, high-reward opportunities. This shift has pushed more adventurous investors toward newer, high-upside tokens like Bitcoin Pepe , which offer greater exposure to speculative momentum. As overall market sentiment turns more optimistic, these early-stage assets are likely to see amplified gains from returning risk capital. BTC shows its metal The rally comes as traditional financial markets face renewed uncertainty. The 30-year US Treasury yield topped 5% this week following Moody’s downgrade of the US sovereign debt rating. Meanwhile, a proposed tax bill in Congress could significantly widen the federal deficit, stoking investor fears over long-term fiscal stability. Bitcoin’s recent price action underscores its evolving role in investor portfolios. The cryptocurrency has increasingly decoupled from equity markets, with BTC soaring even as the S&P 500 fell on Thursday. Bitcoin is now up 18% year-to-date, decisively outperforming major US equities. Gold, the traditional safe haven, has also notched new all-time highs and is rebounding after a brief pullback. Still, Bitcoin’s ascent is drawing particular attention from both retail and institutional investors who increasingly view it as a hedge against macro risk and a diversifier in multi-asset portfolios. The bullish momentum has revived long-term price forecasts. Geoff Kendrick, Head of Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered, issued a note on Tuesday projecting that Bitcoin could reach $500,000 by 2029. That target, once the domain of crypto maximalists, is now being echoed by mainstream analysts as digital assets gain broader acceptance. Why Bitcoin Pepe is poised to benefit Bitcoin’s renewed surge is once again fueling a broader crypto rally, echoing past cycles where capital rotation lifted the entire digital asset landscape. This latest wave of liquidity is reviving interest in speculative plays, especially meme coins. At the center of this resurgence is Bitcoin Pepe, a project that fuses the viral appeal of meme culture with the technical underpinnings of next-generation infrastructure. As the first meme-focused Layer 2 built on Bitcoin, it leverages the network’s robust security while adopting a high-speed, Solana-like framework to scale effectively. The project is moving quickly to expand its ecosystem. These include a partnership with Super Meme for secure meme coin launches via PEP-20. The project is also collaborating with Plena Finance to explore integrating BPEP into mobile-first DeFi. The project also joins hands with GETE Network to potentially bring BPEP into cross-chain Web3 gaming. These alliances not only deepen Bitcoin Pepe’s technical stack but also extend its relevance beyond meme-driven speculation. Investor appetite is already evident— Bitcoin Pepe ’s ongoing presale has attracted over $11 million. Priced at $0.0359, the presale runs through May 31, 2025. An exchange listing is anticipated soon after, potentially unlocking near-term momentum as the market reacts to the debut of this meme-layer infrastructure token.

2025-05-23T03:40:33.000Z,"AI and Mining Data Centers Convergence","HodlX Guest Post Submit Your Post In recent months, AI (artificial intelligence) workloads have gone from theoretical benchmarks to real-time economic pressure on global infrastructure. From language models serving millions of queries per hour to diffusion models requiring vast GPU clusters for inference, the strain on power grids and compute resources is accelerating. Surprisingly, the infrastructure best positioned to absorb this load isn’t housed in Silicon Valley or hyperscale server farms – but in mining data centers. From PoW (proof-of-work) to generative AI Cryptocurrency mining centers were built on the premise of high-density, power-intensive computation – optimized for efficiency, uptime and thermal control. These are the same foundations required for modern AI. But there’s a critical difference – while mining processes are relatively bursty and can be interrupted without business loss, AI workloads are sustained, precision-driven and delay-sensitive. This contrast presents an opportunity . By upgrading cooling systems – particularly through immersion and liquid-based technologies – and optimizing power distribution infrastructure, mining data centers can become hybrid environments. They can run crypto mining when energy costs are low and switch to AI inference jobs when GPU demand spikes. Emerging orchestration platforms, combined with AI-specific scheduling tools, allow dynamic switching between tasks. These tools have demonstrated up to 27 to 33% improvement in job completion times and 1.53x reductions in queuing delays. The economic layer is equally compelling – if AI demand is monetized through inference marketplaces, mining operations may find it more profitable to rent compute power than to mine certain assets. Some mining centers already experiment with FPGA-based setups, which are ASIC-resistant and natively suitable for AI training . This opens the door to full interoperability – where the same infrastructure processes both PoW blocks and transformer models , depending on market conditions. When scale becomes a liability Despite its early lead in AI investment, the US faces a looming infrastructure wall. In Virginia , data centers consume more than 25% of the state’s electricity. In Santa Clara, over 50 data centers now draw 60% of the city’s total power usage, forcing Silicon Valley Power to drastically expand its transmission systems – raising rates for both industrial and residential users. Numerous research show that global electricity demand could more than triple by 2030, largely due to AI . If these projections hold, the US will need not just additional power but smarter load balancing strategies – which traditional hyperscale AI facilities, tied to rigid uptime SLAs, are poorly suited for. To meet this soaring demand, the US must rapidly diversify its energy sources. Scaling up renewables – including utility-scale solar, wind and hydropower – will play a critical role. Yet these sources are inherently intermittent, creating volatility on the grid. This is where mining data centers offer a surprising stabilizing advantage. Designed with demand-flexible architecture, they can pause or throttle operations based on grid load, absorbing excess generation during peak renewable output and scaling down during low-production periods. In Texas, this flexibility has already led to collaborative load-shedding agreements between mining operations and grid operators, positioning these facilities as extremely valuable in next-generation power management. Alternative strategies are also emerging. Electricity imports from Canada , especially through HVDC (high-voltage direct current) lines tapping into hydroelectric power, are under active exploration . On the domestic front, SMRs (small modular reactors) represent a promising path. Developed by several firms and already approved by US regulators, SMRs offer safe, decentralized nuclear power – ideal for pairing with regional AI hubs and compute-heavy facilities . The next AI frontier Bitcoin mining has acted as the early mover in this trend. Yet the real story isn’t just about mining – it’s about what comes next. Mining infrastructure is paving the way for AI to compute at scale. These facilities are testing grounds – where local talent is trained, operational processes are refined and regulatory pathways are explored. With modest hardware upgrades and improved connectivity, many mining centers could pivot to support AI workloads, offering a low-latency, cost-efficient backbone for global model inference. The door to full interoperability What’s needed is a reframing of what data center infrastructure should look like in the AI era. Rather than defaulting to hyperscalers, the future may be modular, flexible and geographically distributed, led by hybrid centers that know how to manage thermal loads, optimize for cost per watt and shift operational models in real time. Batyr is the founder and CEO of Uminers , a full-cycle mining infrastructure provider. He has deep background in data center development, cryptocurrency mining and AI-driven technologies.

2025-05-23T03:00:53.000Z,"Could It Be 15,000%? MAGACOIN FINANCE, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Are Now Entering Analyst Bull Zones","As the summer of 2025 heats up, analysts are zeroing in on a handful of tokens that could deliver life-changing returns. While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the market’s foundational assets, it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that’s rapidly moving from under-the-radar presale to headline contender. With capital rotation intensifying and early-stage momentum building, some experts are now projecting that MAGA, ETH, and BTC could be the next big winners—potentially offering up to 15,000% upside this cycle. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Acceleration and 15,000% Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing major attention in 2025, with over $8 million raised and its presale price still under $0.001. Analysts are projecting up to 18,500% potential returns, with some calling a $1 target by year-end “not out of reach” if current momentum continues. MAGA’s capped supply of 100 billion tokens (45% in presale), audited smart contracts, and political meme appeal are driving rapid community growth and early-stage investor participation. As Stage 8 nears completion and the $0.007 listing target approaches, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being positioned as a rare ground-floor opportunity—one that could rival the early days of SHIBA INU or DOGE, but with a more transparent structure and scarcity-driven upside. Analysts say a 35x surge looks conservative, with 50x or even 150x possible if current trends continue. In pure numbers, even a modest $500 position could scale to $17,000–$25,000 based on prevailing models. For those seeking the next supercycle winner, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the name on every smart investor’s radar. Ethereum: Bullish Structure and 2025 Breakout Forecast Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,621, up 2.8% on the day and showing renewed strength as whales accumulate and network upgrades gather steam. Technical analysis points to possible resistance at $2,853, $3,023, and $3,222, with the 50-day moving average supporting a bullish edge. Looking ahead, DigitalCoinPrice predicts a strong 2025 for ETH, with price targets as high as $5,715 by year-end and new all-time highs above $4,800. As Ethereum’s layer-2 adoption and ecosystem expansion continue, the platform’s role as a store of value and utility token is only strengthening, making it a core holding for those seeking both stability and upside. Bitcoin: Market Anchor, But Capital Rotates to High-Upside Plays Bitcoin (BTC) is holding above $103,000, with May price predictions between $110,000–$115,000 as institutional interest remains strong. While BTC’s dominance is clear, the biggest near-term upside is shifting toward more nimble early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the risk/reward profile is far more attractive. As Bitcoin’s price stabilizes, capital is increasingly rotating into high-upside altcoins like MAGA, where early-stage entries offer the potential for exponential returns before public hype catches on. XRP and HBAR: Steady Growth, But MAGA Steals the Spotlight XRP is trading at $2.36, with analysts watching closely as futures and ETF optimism fuel renewed interest. While XRP’s infrastructure and legal clarity are positives, the most dramatic growth potential may now be shifting toward early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the window for exponential returns remains open. HBAR continues to build through enterprise integrations and real-world use cases, but its near-term upside is less dramatic compared to the explosive potential of MAGA.

2025-05-23T03:00:06.000Z,"Bitcoin From Pizza Day Era Still On The Move, Glassnode Reveals","As Bitcoin Pizza Day turns 15 years old, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has revealed how coins from back then are still being moved. Bitcoin Realized Cap Data Shows Recent Movements From 10+ Years BTC Bitcoin has managed to achieve a new all-time high (ATH), but it’s not the only thing cryptocurrency community members are celebrating today. Back on May 22nd, 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz exchanged 10,000 BTC for two pizzas, in what was perhaps the first example of the asset being used as a mode of payment in a real-world purchase. Given the significance of this event, the date has come to be celebrated as “Bitcoin Pizza Day.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Out Of Bull Pennant—What’s The Target? The pizzas that Laszlo purchased were worth around $40. Fifteen years on, the same amount of BTC translates to a whopping $1.1 billion. Here’s a chart shared by the analytics firm CryptoQuant that shows how this figure has looked on every Bitcoin Pizza Day in history: Naturally, no one could have possibly foreseen just how big Bitcoin would eventually become. But even if they did, transactions like these were probably necessary in bringing the asset to where it’s at today. As CryptoQuant says, “It’s a high price, but it’s the price that was paid to turn Bitcoin into a means of payment.” That said, while many like Laszlo would have actively spent their BTC, some holders didn’t. Whether that’s by accident or a product of willful HODLing is impossible to say for sure, but a chunk of the supply is now aged more than ten years old, meaning the owners of those coins haven’t involved them in a single transaction since then. The analytics firm Glassnode has shared the data for the Realized Cap share of this specific part of the Bitcoin circulating supply. Looks like the value of the metric has seen a notable decline recently | Source: Glassnode on X The Realized Cap basically tells us about the total amount of capital that the Bitcoin investors as a whole have used to purchase their coins. In the chart, the percentage of this metric occupied by the supply aged more than ten years is displayed. Last year, this value hit a peak at 0.045%. Today, the indicator has come to just 0.033%, following steep drawdowns between December and February, and another since April 20th. Based on the trend, Glassnode notes, “15 years after Laszlo bought pizza for 10,000 $BTC – now worth over $1.1B – some of that era’s coins are still moving.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Sets New ATH, But This Metric Says No Overheating Yet Coins that are this old are more likely to have reached that age by being lost than through HODLing conviction, so it’s possible that the old Bitcoin being moved now was just recently rediscovered, either by the original investor or someone else who happened to come across the forgotten wallet keys. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $111,400, up over 7% in the last seven days.

2025-05-23T02:54:27.000Z,"Pi Network Alert: 102M Pi Moved Off OKX, What’s Coming?","The post Pi Network Alert: 102M Pi Moved Off OKX, What’s Coming? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Pi Coin’s price has slipped by more than 3%, currently trading around $0.81. The token recently spiked to $1.60 before quickly pulling back — a move that stirred debate in the crypto community, with some raising concerns about manipulation. At the moment, Pi is holding a crucial support at $0.79, while resistance remains in the $0.99 to $1.20 range. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is hovering near 52, putting the token on the edge of oversold territory — which could tempt bulls looking for a possible entry. Pi Coin is currently 72% down from its ATH of $2.98. Over 102.7 Million Pi Withdrawn from OKX in Just 3 Days In the midst of the price dip, something big is happening under the surface. Crypto analyst Mr. Spock reported that in the past three days alone, a staggering 102,776,657.17 Pi (π) has been withdrawn from OKX, one of the world’s leading crypto exchanges. That’s over 102.7 million Pi coins, potentially worth tens of millions of dollars, now moving on-chain, live, and verified. And these aren’t small transactions — with some single withdrawals topping 70 million Pi. A New Phase for Pi Coin? Mr. Spock said that this marks a turning point for Pi Coin, which has long faced skepticism over whether it would ever achieve meaningful liquidity or utility. “While doubters watched from the sidelines, true Pioneers kept mining, building, and believing — and now, the results are beginning to show,” he said. With Pi now demonstrating large-scale withdrawals, on-chain activity, and practical blockchain functionality, it seems the project is entering a new phase of real-world traction. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pi Network Faces Centralization Power as Vietnam Dominates Its Node Activity , Call for Transparency In May 2025, Pi Network saw unusual migration activity, with 7 million Pi moved in just 24 hours across nearly 19,500 user accounts. Migrations continued overnight, hinting at increased automation. However, concerns have been raised about large transfers from the Pi liquidity reserve wallet to exchanges like OKX and MEXC. While allowed under Pi’s tokenomics, these actions haven’t been clearly communicated. The community is now calling on the Pi Core Team to be more transparent and release regular reports to maintain trust as the network moves forward. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-23T02:38:39.000Z,"‘No questions asked’ Bitcoin launderer gets 6 years in prison","A US man operating what prosecutors called a “no questions asked” cash-to-Bitcoin conversion service has been sentenced to six years behind bars and was ordered to hand over millions of dollars. Boston federal court Judge Richard Stearns sentenced Trung Nguyen, from Danvers, Massachusetts, to six years in prison followed by three years of supervised release, and ordered him to forfeit $1.5 million, the Boston US Attorney’s Office said on May 22. Prosecutors said Nguyen ran an unlicensed money-transmitting business called National Vending between September 2017 and October 2020, which used various techniques he learned in an online course to evade authorities. As part of the course, Nguyen was taught how to conceal his actual business from banks, crypto exchanges and state authorities by masquerading as a vending machine company that accepted cash deposits, had a list of fictional suppliers, and generally avoided using the phrase “Bitcoin” where possible. Prosecutors say Trung Nguyen operated a fake vending machine business to obscure the cash deposits he was receiving. Source: Pacer According to prosecutors, among Nguyen’s customer base were several scam victims who were tricked into converting cash into Bitcoin ( BTC ) by con artists overseas, as well as a drug dealer who sent $250,000 in cash across 10 transactions in 2018. The Justice Department said Nguyen converted more than $1 million to Bitcoin and “purposely failed” to register with the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) despite being required to do so under federal Anti-Money Laundering regulations. Nguyen also “failed to file Suspicious Activity Reports or Currency Transaction Reports on any of these transactions, including cash transactions of more than $10,000,” according to prosecutors. Undercover cops sting Nguyen Nguyen would often meet his clients in person to accept large sums of cash, which is how he was caught, prosecutors said. A May 2023 indictment said that during several meetings with undercover law enforcement officers, he accepted cash and sent Bitcoin in return, taking just over 5% in commission. Related: Crypto use in money laundering ‘far below’ cash — US Treasury The indictment said Nguyen used encrypted messaging apps and “technologies that made it more difficult” to trace his Bitcoin transactions and broke up the cash deposits into smaller sums over consecutive days and at different branches of the same bank to evade notice by authorities. Nguyen was charged with operating an unlicensed money transmitting business and two counts of money laundering. He pleaded not guilty to all charges in June 2023. A jury convicted him in November on the unlicensed money-transmitting business charge and on just one of the money laundering charges, finding him not guilty of a separate money laundering charge.

However, XRP is known for quick, unexpected moves and it is holding steady at an important support level on the daily chart. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.45. XRP has recently shown signs of strength . Last week, it experienced a small pullback and sideways movement due to a bearish divergence. But now, the RSI indicator is moving up, suggesting this weakness might be over — especially while Bitcoin and other altcoins are bouncing back. At the moment, XRP is holding within a price range between $1.57 (April low) and $3.40 (recent high). The price has not yet shown a clear breakout in either direction. Analysts suggest this range could develop into a triangle pattern or other formations over time. Short-Term XRP Analysis In the shorter time frame, XRP is trading between $2.15 and $2.31 as support, and $2.48 to $2.61 as resistance.

There’s a chance we could see a quick jump toward the $3.30–$3.40 zone, especially if Bitcoin and the broader market continue to gain momentum. What to Keep an Eye On If XRP breaks below $2.31 and then $2.28, it might suggest that the latest short-term rally has ended, and the price could drop toward the $1.79–$2.60 region before finding new support. Overall, even though XRP is currently moving within a tight range, the bigger picture remains bullish — with no major signs of a long-term top forming just yet. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

However, one of the examples examined by Moonlock did not feature the full anti-Ledger phishing functionality advertised. The firm speculates those features could “still be in development or is forthcoming in future updates.” Moonlock says hackers are offering malware for would-be thieves to steal from Ledger users.

It’s an increase of 30% since the start of May as derivatives speculators load up on leverage in anticipation of higher Bitcoin prices.Open interest is the total number of outstanding futures contracts that allow traders to bet on the future price of Bitcoin, which have not been settled or closed, showing the total amount of current market speculation.Total Bitcoin futures OI. Source: CoinglassWhen OI surges, it indicates massive leveraged positions are built up in the market, with lots of traders holding large positions with borrowed money. If Bitcoin’s price moves against these over-leveraged positions, traders get forcibly liquidated, and the flushout can create selling pressure on Bitcoin, which can cause a rapid drop in prices and high volatility.However, analysts suggest the surge in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows, which have seen more than $2.5 billion this week, can counter some of that extended leverage.Related: Crypto perp futures coming ‘very soon,’ says CFTC’s MersingerBitcoin options markets show a similar pattern with open interest over $1.5 billion at the $110,000 and $120,000 strike prices on the Deribit exchange.

2025-05-23T05:11:25.000Z,"Trendspotting in crypto: How to discover winning projects before the crowd","TL;DRSpotting the next big crypto project before it explodes demands data, discipline and a sharp eye for real signals. This guide explores how to identify early winners by analyzing onchain metrics, tokenomics, dev activity and community traction while avoiding the common traps of hype-driven pumps and red-flag projects.Despite the crypto space being crowded, fast-moving and full of noise, some investors manage to consistently find promising projects while they’re still under the radar.So, how do they do it? Crypto trendspotters know how to read onchain data. They understand tokenomics. They read GitHub commits and follow the money. It takes more than jumping on the hype bandwagon ahead of the crowd.This guide breaks down how to find crypto projects with real potential using lessons from past winners like Solana, Arbitrum, Chainlink and even memecoins like Pepe. Along the way, it will highlight the tools that matter, red flags to avoid and the difference between organic growth and manufactured buzz.How the real winners took offSolanaWhen Solana launched in 2020, few outside of developer circles had heard of it. But it had one big edge: speed. Solana’s proof-of-history tech made it one of the fastest chains around, and it quickly became a magnet for builders, especially in DeFi and NFTs. By 2021, its ecosystem exploded with apps like Serum and Magic Eden.Early adopters who paid attention to onchain growth — like wallet activity and DEX volume — could see something brewing. Solana (SOL) went from under $1 to $50+ in less than a year. Arbitrum Arbitrum launched in 2021 as an Ethereum layer 2, but its big moment came with the Arbitrum (ARB) token airdrop in March 2023. At launch, Arbitrum was already processing more transactions than many layer 1s and had billions in total value locked (TVL) in decentralized applications (DApps).Smart investors were watching. Even before the token, the signs were there: user activity, rising liquidity and growing app adoption. When ARB dropped, the pump stuck because the foundation was real.ChainlinkChainlink is a classic example of a project with long-term utility. It doesn’t have flashy branding or meme power, but it does one thing incredibly well: feed real-world data into smart contracts.By 2024, it had become the backbone of much of DeFi, gaming and even tokenized real-world assets. If you were watching closely in 2019-2020, you saw LINK (LINK) getting integrated everywhere. That kind of early utility often flies under the radar — until price action catches up.PEPE Coin (PEPE)Let’s not pretend memes don’t matter. Pepe (PEPE) launched in 2023 with no roadmap, no utility and no VC backing. But it hit a nerve, and the internet ran with it. The coin hit a billion-dollar market cap within weeks.That kind of run is rare — and risky. But for traders tracking social sentiment, wallet distribution and community activity, the early signals were all there. PEPE didn’t promise anything, but it delivered returns by becoming a viral moment.How to find crypto gems earlySo, how do you separate the next Solana from the next rug pull? Here’s how serious trendspotters approach it.1. Start with onchain metricsPublic blockchains are transparent. Use that to look at:Daily active walletsTransaction volumeTokenholder growthLiquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs)TVL (for DeFi projects).If users and capital are moving in — before the token moons — that’s a great sign. Tools like Dune Analytics, Nansen and DefiLlama are your best friends here.2. Understand the tokenomicsAsk questions like:What’s the total supply? How much is circulating?Are there upcoming unlocks or vesting cliffs?Who holds the tokens, and how concentrated are the top wallets?Is there utility? Does the token do anything?Tokens with capped supply, smart incentives (like staking or burn mechanisms) and fair distribution models tend to do better long-term.3. Check developer activityIs the team actually building?GitHub is a goldmine. Look at how often code is pushed, how many contributors are active, and whether the repo looks alive.

Look for ecosystem signalsAre other developers building on top of it? Are DApps launching? Is liquidity growing? Are users coming back week after week?Ecosystem growth is hard to fake, and it’s often the strongest early indicator that a project has legs.5. Follow the communityX, Discord, Telegram, Reddit — yes, it’s noisy. But it’s also where trends start. Look beyond the price talk:Are people actually using the product?Are devs answering questions?Is the tone constructive or just hype?Use LunarCrush or Santiment to track social momentum, but always double-check it with onchain data.Key tools to spot crypto trendsHere’s a quick rundown of the top platforms used by smart crypto trendspotters:Top tip: Don’t just use one tool. Great traders cross-reference everything.Crypto trend analysis 2025A coin might be flying, but is it because people are actually using it or just talking about it? Learning to tell the difference can save you from making a bad investment. Signs of real tractionSteady user growth and TVL over time: If users are showing up before a token pumps — and the numbers keep climbing week over week — that’s usually a sign of substance. You’ll often see this in DeFi protocols or layer 2s gaining trust slowly, not overnight.Code commits and product updates: A live GitHub with regular commits, active devs and visible progress means the team is building. This shows momentum and long-term focus — not just a marketing push.More tokenholders, less whale control: When new holders join steadily — and supply isn’t all locked up by the top five wallets — it’s a healthier setup. Distributed ownership reduces the risk of rug pulls or coordinated dumps.New integrations and ecosystem activity: If other apps are integrating the token or building on the protocol, it usually means the tech is solid and useful. This kind of network effect compounds fast and often precedes a breakout.Liquidity that builds slowly: Gradual increases in liquidity and trading volume tend to reflect real interest. If liquidity sticks around (rather than vanishing after a pump), it’s usually organic.Signs of manufactured hypeSudden spikes in social mentions or trading volume with no news: If the project is everywhere on X overnight, but there’s no product update, launch or roadmap shift, be skeptical. It’s likely a coordinated shill.Influencer spam and recycled talking points: When you see multiple anonymous influencers posting the same meme or catchphrase, that’s a signal someone’s trying to manufacture buzz.No dev activity or roadmap: If there’s no GitHub, no changelog and the team isn’t shipping anything, it’s probably just a hype machine.Anonymous team, outrageous promises: Combine a mystery team with claims like “100x guaranteed,” and you’re likely looking at a cash grab. Real builders let the work speak for itself.Rule of thumb: If the price is moving and everything else — users, devs, integrations — is standing still, you’re looking at hype. But when those fundamentals are quietly ticking up in the background? That’s when it’s worth a closer look.More red flagsSome projects look great on the surface — slick websites, trending hashtags, a fast-moving chart — but fall apart under the hood. Here are some more red flags to watch out for:High holder concentration: If most of the token is sitting in a handful of wallets, it doesn’t take much for a price crash. Whales often buy early and dump on retail.Unverified token contracts: A token that hasn’t been verified on Etherscan or BscScan might hide functions that allow minting, blocking wallets or draining liquidity. Always check the contract or look for an audit.No liquidity lock or audit: If the devs control all the liquidity provider tokens and there’s no lock or time-locked contract, they can pull the rug at any moment. Similarly, no third-party audit? That’s a gamble.Big token unlocks coming up: Large unlocks for insiders or early investors can trigger huge sell-offs. If you’re holding during a major vesting event, you could be exit liquidity. Know the schedule.Top tip: Before you click buy, ask, Who stands to gain the most if this pumps? Who gets hurt if it dumps? If the answer points to a few insiders with heavy bags and zero accountability, walk away.How to spot crypto trends before the crowdThe best early investors are the mechanics looking under the hood. They study token structures and unlock schedules, join communities early to catch signals firsthand, and follow the builders to see who’s actually shipping. Most importantly, they cross-check everything: on-chain data, social sentiment, developer activity, and liquidity. Tools like Dune, DefiLlama, Nansen and GitHub help them separate noise from substance — and spot winners before the crowd does.Crypto rewards those who are curious, critical and a little bit contrarian. The crowd usually shows up late. If you want to find gems before they moon, you’ll need to think independently, dig deeper, and act before the narrative forms.It’s not easy. But it’s doable. And the more you practice spotting early signals — the real ones, not the noise — the more second nature it becomes.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

He pleaded not guilty to all charges in June 2023.A jury convicted him in November on the unlicensed money-transmitting business charge and on just one of the money laundering charges, finding him not guilty of a separate money laundering charge.Magazine: Lazarus Group’s favorite exploit revealed — Crypto hacks analysis",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/no-questions-asked-bitcoin-launderer-gets-6-years?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

According to a report from My London, Jacob Irwin-Cline went out to a London bar and had several drinks before calling an Uber to take him home.Cline said that he did not thoroughly check the details of the Uber ride on his phone and left with a random private cab driver resembling the Uber driver at first glance, but driving a different vehicle — a detail Cline would only discover after the incident.Once inside the vehicle, the US tourist said the driver offered him a cigarette, which Cline said was likely laced with a rare and potent sedative drug called scopolamine. Cline added that the cigarette made him feel extremely docile and tired, causing him to pass out for around 30 minutes before regaining consciousness.Shortly after Cline woke up, the driver ordered him out of the vehicle. As Cline exited, the driver suddenly sped off, striking him with the car and fleeing with his cellphone, which contained his private keys and access to his crypto accounts.The unfortunate incident comes amid a recent spate of kidnappings, extortion incidents, armed robberies, and ransom attempts directed at crypto industry executives, investors, and their families.

The proposed amendment would come after 18 Democrats sided with Republicans in the Senate in voting to advance the bill on May 20 after it failed a procedural vote on May 8.“Passing the GENIUS Act without our anti-corruption amendment stamps a Congressional seal of approval on Trump selling access and influence to the highest bidder,” Merkley said in a May 22 X post.Trump his three sons are involved in the crypto platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI), which launched its USD1 stablecoin in March.

Merkley is expected to attend a protest organized by the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, in partnership with progressive political organization Our Revolution, outside the Trump venue on May 22. Warren held a press conference with Merkley, Senator Chris Murphy and Public Citizen representatives, calling on Trump to “release the guest list” for the dinner event.

However, the final decision by the US SEC should be made in October.Excessive demand for bullish leveraged XRP causes a positive funding rate, meaning longs (buyers) are the ones paying the carry cost.

Far from being bearish, the current level leaves room for bullish positioning on XRP futures markets.Related: Which senators invest in crypto? 11 lawmakers have blockchain-related investmentsFavorable regulation opens the door for new partnerships and acquisitionsPart of the limited XRP price upside can be explained by the multiple rejections of US Senator Cynthia Lummis, Chair of the US Congress Digital Assets Subcommittee, to meet Ripple representatives. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse asked on May 19 that the lawmaker “reconsider and be a leader for ALL of crypto,” and discuss “how to make the US the crypto capital of the world.”There is nothing stopping XRP from hitting $3.50 or even higher, as Ripple Labs is no longer facing direct threats from regulators, which paves the way for partnerships and acquisitions.

With Bitcoin (BTC) hitting an all-time high, market speculators are banking on eventual capital rotation, which could pump major altcoins like SOL toward new highs.Solana shows promising signs on the daily chart, forming a textbook bull flag pattern after a strong uptrend. While SOL prices currently trade under $180, a breakout above this level could propel SOL toward its first target at $200, with further upside potential to $220 if momentum sustains.Solana 1-day chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe trend remains bullish, supported by the relative strength index (RSI) at 64.30, indicating healthy momentum without overbought conditions. However, SOL needs a clear market structure break (MSB) or a decisive bullish breakout above $180 to trigger the next leg of the rally. Declining volumes during the consolidation phase suggest caution, as a lack of buying pressure could stall the breakout. If SOL fails to breach $180, the immediate key area of interest is between $140-150, and the bull flag pattern would be invalidated.

2025-05-22T15:00:00.000Z,"Semiconductor exemptions don’t matter when it comes to tariffs","Opinion by: Ahmad Shadid of O.xyzSemiconductors scored a rare exemption from US President Donald Trump’s aggressive reciprocal tariffs, but the relief is symbolic at best. Most semiconductors enter the US embedded in servers, GPUs, laptops, and smartphones. The finished goods remain heavily tariffed, some with duties reaching up to 49%. The exemption looks good politically but delivers little practical benefit. Nvidia’s DGX systems, crucial for training advanced AI models, do not fall under the exempted HTS codes. Nvidia could pay effective tariffs nearing 40% on these vital components. Such costs threaten to stall critical AI infrastructure projects across the country. Semiconductor tariffs may compromise the goal of the CHIPS Act. The act promised tens of billions of dollars in subsidies to support domestic chip manufacturing. Yet advanced lithography machines — key equipment from countries like the Netherlands and Japan — face 20%–24% tariffs. Ironically, tariffs designed to boost American production increase the cost of essential manufacturing equipment.The effect of new tariffs is already slowing progress in critical supply chains — just as generative AI and large language models are gaining momentum across sectors like finance and defense. Any delays or cost increases now could blunt America’s technological advantage.Indirect costs undermine exemptions for AIModern semiconductor supply chains are global and highly integrated. An exemption on raw silicon means nothing when servers, GPUs and other finished products face steep tariffs. Tariffs indirectly inflate costs, eliminating any competitive advantage from domestic manufacturing.Indirect tariff costs hit high-end systems disproportionately hard. The effect ripples through AI model training, data center expansions and major infrastructure projects, significantly slowing the industry’s momentum.Tariff impasse halts investmentSo far, it’s clear that the US president’s tariff plan didn’t follow any conventional economic trends or calculated strategy. The uncertain tariff situation stalls investment decisions across the technology sector. Companies need predictable costs to justify large capital expenditures. Ongoing tariff volatility prevents them from committing resources to new data centers and manufacturing lines.This mirrors the supply chain chaos of 2020. At that time, uncertainty caused massive order cancellations and slowed industry recovery for years. If tariff ambiguity continues, we could see similar waves of cancellations in 2025. This would further compound existing inventory and revenue issues in the semiconductor sector.Domestic production is not optimalThe border argument for these tariffs is that they’re meant to boost domestic production. They do little, however, to encourage genuine domestic semiconductor production. Despite subsidies under the CHIPS Act, most US semiconductor companies still rely on international foundries for manufacturing. Instead, they face increased equipment and operational costs.Recent: How trade wars impact stocks and cryptoThe idea that tariffs promote domestic production ignores the reality of global semiconductor manufacturing. Costs rise across the board, putting American companies at a disadvantage rather than offering protection.AI projects face heightened riskThe blockchain and crypto sectors, particularly AI-driven projects, also feel the pinch. Projects depend heavily on GPUs and high-performance servers for mining, validating transactions and running decentralized AI computations. Increased hardware costs directly affect profitability and growth, potentially stalling innovation in blockchain applications. AI developments have just started to pick up the pace in the blockchain and Web3 space. The industry saw increased interest from investors and VCs just a year ago. So, they are still on tighter budgets. Elevated costs can, however, lead to stagnation. We might see innovators and developers exiting the market. The ripple effect extends beyond the general technology sector and could threaten future digital economies. Moreover, these cost pressures disproportionately affect startups and smaller tech firms. Industry giants can absorb additional expenses, but innovative, smaller players face existential threats. This dynamic risks stifling innovation at the grassroots level, harming the entire tech ecosystem.What to expect Semiconductors have momentarily escaped direct tariffs, but the exemption provides little benefit. Tariffs continue to hit finished products, driving up indirect costs across the industry. Instead of boosting domestic manufacturing, these tariffs create economic paralysis, stall critical infrastructure projects, and threaten America’s lead in AI innovation. Policymakers must acknowledge these realities and adjust their approach before irreversible damage is done to the nation’s technological future.Opinion by: Ahmad Shadid of O.xyz.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-22T13:30:00.000Z,"How staking incentivizes trust without burning energy","What if a financial system could run itself not by burning electricity, but by rewarding good behavior? That’s the promise of staking, a mechanism that powers many modern blockchains by turning users into network operators. In this week’s episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Gareth Jenkinson and Nathan Jeffay sit down with StarkWare’s Noam Nisan to unpack how this trustless engine works, why it matters and what’s really at stake.Understanding stakingJeffay began by highlighting how staking is part of the backbone that keeps the blockchain running, and runs itself, with volunteers.“By doing this, they’re saying, OK, we’re taking this task of running the blockchain seriously. Here's some of our money. We're putting it down. We're showing that we're serious about doing this.”To help unpack this topic further and examine the deeper mechanics behind staking, the hosts are joined by Noam Nisan, principal researcher at StarkWare and a widely respected computer scientist who has held roles at Google and Princeton.Related: How to handle crypto trading gains and losses on your balance sheet“So we have this general system with operators... Why would they want to do that? The system, the protocol, incentivizes them to actually run the system,” Nisan explained. “Basically, it can give them tokens for operating the system.”Staking offers what Nisan describes as two distinct types of security: computer science-based guarantees and economic disincentives for bad actors. “If a majority or supermajority, maybe two-thirds of the parties of the token of the staked amount are behaving properly... we can prove that the system acts correctly,” he said. “But you also have what I would call an economic guarantee... if they destroy the system, very likely the value of the token... will go down. So they are the one losing.”PoW vs PoSJenkinson, a vocal Bitcoin (BTC) supporter, posed the classic comparison: proof-of-work vs proof-of-stake. “Do you have any strong feelings about one or the other?” he asked.“The truth is that it’s not clear.. it's really a social question, I think.”Nisan noted that both mechanisms involve trade-offs around cost, control, and decentralization. The episode also explores the role of staking in tokenomics and system design. Nisan unpacks how fee mechanics and inflation controls, such as Ethereum’s minting curve, help keep the ecosystem in balance.To hear the full conversation on The Clear Crypto Podcast,  listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

2025-05-22T13:19:19.000Z,"These 4 memecoins can outperform Bitcoin this cycle","Key takeaways:Memecoins like Fartcoin, WIF, SPX6900, and Popcat are outperforming Bitcoin in the short term amid renewed crypto market euphoria.Bullish technical patterns signal more upside for top-performing memecoins.Popcat stands out with a potential 350% rally, while Fartcoin and WIF also eye significant gains in the coming weeks.Bitcoin (BTC) has surged 7.35% over the past three days, hitting a new all-time high near $112,000 on May 22, but memecoins are stealing the spotlight. Fueled by BTC’s rally, several high-risk tokens are posting even larger gains, stoking possibilities that they could continue to outperform Bitcoin as the crypto bull run accelerates.Fartcoin ascending channel hints at more gainsSolana-based Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) memecoin has surged 30% in the last three days to hit $1.57 as of May 22, its highest level in the last four months.The rally extends Fartcoin’s strong year-to-date (YTD) performance—up 74.50%—amid the ongoing memecoin frenzy. In comparison, Bitcoin has risen 18% so far in 2025.Technically, Fartcoin is trading within a well-defined ascending channel that began forming in early March, suggesting sustained bullish momentum.FARTCOIN/USDT daily price chart. Source: TradingViewThe memecoin has also broken above its 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA; the red wave), currently near $1.06, a key support level in uptrends.FARTCOIN’s relative strength index (RSI) was hovering near 64 as of May 22, suggesting there is room to run before selling conditions emerge near the overbought threshold at 70. If the uptrend holds, Fartcoin could retest the channel’s upper boundary near $2.74 by June, up 80% from the current price levels.Dogwifhat price could doubleLike FARTCOIN, Dogwifhat (WIF) has outperformed Bitcoin during the recent rally, up over 27% in the past three days. But the Solana memecoin has underperformed the top cryptocurrency year-to-date, down about 38%.But a bull pennant formation may put Dogwifhat in a position to catch up in the coming weeks. As of May 22, WIF’s price was testing the pennant’s upper trendline for a breakout, with its technical target at around $2.50, up about 125% from the current price levels.  WIF/USDT daily price chart.

It is, therefore, underperforming Bitcoin on a YTD timeframe but, like WIF, shows the potential of outperforming BTC this cycle in percentage terms.At the core of this bullish outlook is SPX6900’s ongoing bullish reversal attempts.

2025-05-22T12:38:44.000Z,"UK court partially dismisses Bitcoin SV investor’s lawsuit against Binance","The United Kingdom’s Court of Appeal has partially dismissed a lawsuit brought by Bitcoin SV investors against major crypto exchanges, including Binance, for allegedly conspiring to delist the token in 2019.In a judgment handed down on May 21, the court ruled that investors who held BSV through the delisting period (classified as “sub-class B”) were not entitled to billions in speculative damages based on BSV’s hypothetical growth.These investors had claimed over 8.9 billion British pounds ($11.9 billion) in damages, asserting that Binance’s delisting deprived holders of the chance to profit from BSV’s potential rise to a “top-tier cryptocurrency” like Bitcoin (BTC) or Bitcoin Cash (BCH).The court rejected this “foregone growth effect” theory, stating, “BSV was obviously not a unique cryptocurrency without reasonably similar substitutes,” pointing to the representative’s own use of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash as comparators.Sub-class B’s central claim was that delisting led to a missed opportunity to benefit from price appreciation. However, the court determined that those investors had ample chance to mitigate losses by selling or reinvesting in other crypto assets.“They had a duty to mitigate their losses,” wrote Master of the Rolls Sir Geoffrey Vos. “They cannot recover losses that they could reasonably have mitigated.”UK court ruling against Bitcoin SV investor’s lawsuit. Source: CaselawRelated: Bitcoin SV investors attempt to resurrect 2019 Binance lawsuitCourt strikes down “loss of a chance” argumentThe appeal also challenged the Tribunal’s application of the “market mitigation rule,” arguing that such issues should be left for trial.The court dismissed that notion, stating the rule clearly applies to freely tradable assets like BSV, and that the damages must be measured shortly after the delisting.An additional argument concerning the “loss of a chance” to benefit from future price gains was also struck down. The court ruled it “flawed as a matter of principle,” noting that “cryptocurrencies are, by their nature, volatile investments.”Binance’s limited strike-out application ultimately succeeded, with the court stating that even if some holders were unaware of the delisting, “they could never claim more than the total value of their holding before the delisting events plus any quantifiable consequential losses.”Related: Binance wants arbitration for all members of securities class suitBinance seeks to dismiss FTX lawsuitOn May 16, Binance filed a motion to dismiss a $1.76 billion lawsuit filed by the FTX estate, arguing that the claims are legally flawed and an attempt to shift responsibility for FTX’s collapse.The exchange stated the downfall of FTX stemmed from internal fraud, not external manipulation, citing Sam Bankman-Fried’s conviction on multiple fraud charges.Binance has asked the court to dismiss all claims with prejudice.

2025-05-22T10:21:18.000Z,"Can ChatGPT-powered AI agents really trade crypto for you?","Key takeawaysChatGPT-powered AI agents automate trading tasks using natural language prompts and API integrations, improving speed and consistency.Successes occur when ChatGPT is used as a support tool, not a fully autonomous trading system.Failures happen when traders over-rely on ChatGPT without real-time data, proper risk management or manual oversight.Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance.What if a crypto trader didn’t need to constantly check charts, worry about emotions, or stay up all night watching for sudden price swings? What if those tasks could be handled by an intelligent agent that understands instructions in plain English — and reacts within milliseconds? That’s where ChatGPT-powered AI agents come in.These tools combine natural language processing with real-time trading logic to automate decision-making in one of the world’s most volatile markets. From rebalancing portfolios to reacting to market sentiment, ChatGPT is being adapted to act as a trading assistant, risk manager and market analyst — all rolled into one. But can it truly match or even outperform human intuition? This article explores how far these agents have come, where they shine and where they still fall short.How ChatGPT-powered AI agents operate in cryptocurrency marketsChatGPT-powered AI agents are changing how people interact with crypto markets. These tools combine ChatGPT’s language abilities with external trading tools and APIs to help users monitor prices, understand trends and even place trades automatically. Instead of just reacting to charts or numbers, ChatGPT can understand plain language commands like “Buy Ethereum if the price drops below $2,000” or “Sell Bitcoin if RSI goes above 70.”These AI trading assistants can work with major platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, OKX and other centralized or decentralized exchanges and can also tap into decentralized finance (DeFi) tools and smart contracts. With the right setup, ChatGPT can help automate trading strategies based on both technical data and market news.Success stories vs. failures in ChatGPT-powered crypto tradingSome traders have used ChatGPT to assist in automating parts of their crypto trading processes, particularly for strategy generation and sentiment analysis. For example, a user shared on Reddit that they used a ChatGPT-based AI agent for technical analysis on Ether (ETH), feeding it four-hour and daily chart screenshots. By interpreting market sentiment, support and resistance zones, and other indicators, they managed to make $6,500 in profits.Similarly, in the broader crypto sector, ChatGPT has been applied to support project development activities such as drafting white papers and marketing content. A notable example is the launch of the “TURBO” memecoin, which reportedly reached a market capitalization of over $50 million in 2024. In this case, ChatGPT was used to streamline documentation and communication rather than manage trading activity, illustrating its usefulness as a support tool in crypto-related initiatives.However, limitations are evident when ChatGPT is applied beyond its core design. While ChatGPT could suggest a trading portfolio and explain its reasoning clearly, it lacks access to real-time market data and couldn’t respond to sudden volatility. In one instance, ChatGPT was allocated $100 across multiple tokens but failed to actively manage the portfolio as prices fluctuated. This resulted in missed opportunities and underperformance compared to dynamic algorithmic strategies.Individual experiences reinforce these observations. A Redditor exposed a scam where a YouTuber promoted a “ChatGPT trading bot” tutorial that led users to deploy malicious smart contracts. The contracts, generated using ChatGPT and passed off as safe, were designed to drain user wallets once funded. Victims collectively lost $17,240 in ETH, highlighting the danger of blindly trusting AI-generated code without proper auditing.Even when asked, “If I use ChatGPT to build an AI agent for crypto trading, can I become a millionaire?” ChatGPT responded with a realistic outlook — acknowledging that while it’s possible, success depends on having a profitable strategy, disciplined risk management, and the ability to scale effectively.Here is ChatGPT’s response:These cases suggest that while ChatGPT can support certain elements of the trading process, it should not be treated as a standalone solution for autonomous crypto trading.AI in crypto trading: Key benefits and limitationsAI tools like ChatGPT are increasingly being integrated into crypto trading workflows to improve speed, accuracy and efficiency. While they offer important advantages, they also carry specific limitations that traders must actively manage. Below are the main benefits and challenges:Key benefits of using AI for crypto tradingAI bots can execute trades in milliseconds, crucial for capturing opportunities in fast-moving crypto markets.Bots follow pre-programmed rules precisely, eliminating emotional biases that often affect human traders.Crypto markets are always open, and AI bots can monitor and act around the clock without interruption.A single bot can manage multiple trading pairs, exchanges and strategies simultaneously.ChatGPT can understand specific prompts like “Rebalance every Monday” or “Set stop-loss at 5%,” allowing flexible automation.Limitations of ChatGPT in cryptocurrency tradingChatGPT does not access live market data unless specifically integrated with external APIs (e.g., TradingView, CoinMarketCap or exchange websockets).Instructions must be clear and unambiguous; ChatGPT may misinterpret vague or complex commands.Improperly secured API keys or lack of two-factor authentication (2FA) can expose trading accounts to unauthorized access.ChatGPT’s cloud-based infrastructure can introduce latency, which could impact performance during highly volatile periods.ChatGPT does not monitor regional compliance rules; users must manually enforce trading limits based on local regulations.Ethical and regulatory implications of AI in crypto tradingAs AI becomes more integrated into trading systems, it raises significant ethical and regulatory concerns that stakeholders across the financial sector are beginning to address.Accountability: If an AI agent executes a harmful or unlawful trade, questions arise around legal responsibility. It remains unclear in many jurisdictions whether liability falls primarily on the developer, the trader using the AI system or the platform facilitating the transactions.Market manipulation risks: Autonomous AI bots could unintentionally engage in activities such as spoofing (placing and canceling fake orders to mislead the market) or wash trading (creating artificial volume), especially if not properly programmed with compliance safeguards.Regulatory oversight: Financial authorities, including the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the European Securities and Markets Authority, are actively studying the implications of AI and algorithmic trading. These agencies have recognized that traditional trading regulations may not fully account for autonomous decision-making by AI systems.Policy developments: In January 2024, the European Commission released updates to its Digital Finance Strategy, which included references to AI-based financial services. While not yet finalized, these draft regulations under the broader Digital Finance Package signal a move toward stricter compliance expectations for firms deploying AI in financial markets.Meanwhile, ethical crypto platforms are beginning to voluntarily disclose the use of trading bots in their systems. In parallel, open-source communities are advocating for clearer audit trails, improved model transparency and the establishment of ethical guidelines for AI applications in finance to ensure accountability and fairness.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-22T10:02:14.000Z,"Crypto travelers bring 3x greater lifetime value than fiat users","Travelers using cryptocurrency for booking arrangements spend more than twice as much as regular travelers using fiat money, according to a joint report from Binance Pay and crypto travel platform Travala shared with Cointelegraph.Crypto-based bookings on Travala reached $80 million in 2024, up from $45 million the year before. Crypto travelers are also outspending their fiat counterparts, with an average booking value of  $1,211 per transaction, over 2.5 times more than fiat users who spend $469.Additionally, the report said crypto users were three times more valuable over their lifetime due to longer stays and higher repeat bookings, with crypto travelers 57% more likely to make a repeat hotel purchase.Source: Binance Pay, TravalaJuan Otero, CEO of Travala, attributed these travel preferences to the flexible nature of Web3 jobs:“Many also work in the digital asset industry or have flexible, remote work lifestyles, which makes them more likely to travel frequently and stay in one place for longer while seeking out destinations that support seamless, global payments.”Crypto-based transactions have become more common in the travel sector and beyond. Airlines that have integrated digital currencies into their booking systems have seen a 40% boost in bookings, with travel and hospitality representing 14% of all crypto transactions in 2024, according to a Feb. 21 report by Triple-A.Related: Crypto spending will grow, but fiat isn’t going anywhere: Mercuryo CEOThe main benefit of using crypto for travel is its borderless, global utility, Jonathan Lim, the global head of Binance Pay, told Cointelegraph. “Travelers can skip currency exchange lines, avoid foreign transaction fees, and pay instantly using assets they already hold,” he added.A growing number of crypto users also drives the increase in travelers using crypto to pay for trips. Triple-A’s report shows that cryptocurrency ownership has a compound annual growth rate of 99%, significantly outpacing the growth of traditional payment methods. Among crypto owners, 65% express interest in using it for payments.Founded in 2017, Travala is among the most popular crypto-native travel platforms, which enables users to pay for services like flights, hotel stays and tours with 141 different cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC) and USDC (USDC) via Binance Pay. Related: Bhutan launches tourism crypto payments with Binance Pay and DK BankCrypto payment covers more and more retail industriesThe first real-world Bitcoin transaction — 10,000 BTC for two pizzas — occurred 15 years ago today, on May 22, 2010, now commemorated as Bitcoin Pizza Day.

2025-05-22T08:37:57.000Z,"Dubai regulator clarifies real-world asset tokenization rules: Lawyer","Newly updated guidelines from Dubai’s crypto regulator include provisions on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and clarify rules for issuers. On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) released its updated Rulebook for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) operating in the region. The regulator gave market participants until June 19 to comply with the new rules. The regulator previously told Cointelegraph that it had enhanced supervisory mechanisms and brought consistency across activity-based rules. One of the more prominent changes includes regulatory clarity on RWA tokens. Irina Heaver, partner at the United Arab Emirates-based law firm NeosLegal, told Cointelegraph that the updated rules clarify RWA issuance and distribution. “Issuing real-world asset tokens and listing them on secondary markets is no longer theoretical,” Heaver told Cointelegraph. “It’s now a regulatory reality in Dubai and the broader UAE.”A “viable” path to realize RWA hypeHeaver compared RWAs to security token offerings (STOs), an earlier attempt from the crypto space to tokenize securities like stocks, bonds and real estate investment trusts. However, the UAE crypto lawyer said that STOs “died a peaceful death in 2018 to 2019.” The lawyer told Cointelegraph STOs did not work out because of the lack of regulatory clarity, viable secondary market trading venues, institutional investor appetite and liquidity. Still, the situation is different for RWAs. Heaver told Cointelegraph that RWAs are the next foundational layer for institutional adoption of blockchain and virtual assets. Heaver said that VARA’s new rules already cover them as Asset-Referenced Virtual Assets (ARVA) tokens. She said: “VARA’s newly updated Virtual Asset Issuance Rulebook (May 2025) addresses these failures head-on. Regulated exchanges and broker-dealers in Dubai are now authorized to distribute and list ARVA tokens.”The lawyer said this solves an issue in jurisdictions like Switzerland, where token issuance is possible, but listing and secondary trading remain unregulated. Related: Dubai gov’t agencies to link real estate registry with property tokenizationLawyer shares requirements for RWA issuersHeaver said ARVA tokens are defined under Dubai law as representing direct or indirect ownership of real-world assets, granting entitlement to receive or share income and purporting to maintain a stable value by reference to real-world assets or income. ARVA tokens are also backed or collateralised by such real-world assets or constitute a derivative, wrapped, duplicated, or fractionalised version of another ARVA. The lawyer said issuers must meet specific requirements, including a Category 1 Virtual Asset Issuance license, a comprehensive white paper and a risk disclosure statement. In addition, issuers must have a paid-up capital of 1.5 million UAE dirhams (about $408,000) or 2% of reserve assets held. The issuers are also subjected to monthly independent audit obligations and must adhere to ongoing supervisory oversight. “VARA is providing regulatory clarity, and it’s giving the industry a viable, enforceable path to turn the hype of RWA tokenization into reality,” Heaver told Cointelegraph. “This matters because it marks a shift, from theory to execution, from fiction to framework.”Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/dubai-vara-guidelines-rwa-tokenization-clarity?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-22T08:25:00.000Z,"5 red flags you’re being shilled: Don’t buy the hype","What is shilling in crypto?              At its core, shilling is the act of artificially promoting a cryptocurrency or token, often with exaggerated claims, to increase its price or popularity. But what’s the goal? Hype it up, get others to buy in, and then cash out, leaving latecomers holding the bag.Shilling can come from anyone: influencers, anonymous accounts or even high-profile figures with political or financial clout. The common thread is manipulation: It’s not about educating you or building real value but pumping hype for personal gain.Unfortunately, the line between enthusiastic promotion and outright deception can be thin, and many fall victim without realizing it. That’s why it’s critical to learn how to spot the signs early.                  5 red flags you’re being shilled              Beware of crypto red flags like overhyped promises, anonymous teams, influencer shills, missing products and FOMO tactics — if it smells like a scam, it probably is.1. Overhyped promises You’ve probably seen posts that scream:“100x potential!”“Guaranteed returns!”“This is your ticket to financial freedom!”These are classic shill tactics. Real, credible projects don’t promise life-changing profits. Why? Because there are no guarantees in crypto or in any investment.When a project leads with grandiose financial claims rather than actual product value or utility, it’s likely a ploy to stir FOMO and attract unsuspecting investors. The truth is, if something sounds too good to be true, it almost always is.Remember: The bigger the promise, the bigger the red flag.2. Anonymous or suspicious teams In crypto, anonymity isn’t always bad, but when you’re trusting people with your money, transparency matters.It’s a major red flag when a project has:No identifiable team membersFake names or aliasesStock photos on its websiteNo LinkedIn or professional history.The simple rule is “No face, no funds.”Scammers often hide behind anonymity because they know they’ll eventually vanish and there’ll be no one to hold accountable. Even worse, some use fabricated credentials or hire actors to pose as team members.Before investing, check whether the founders or developers have any verifiable history. Do they have prior experience in blockchain or startups? Have they launched anything successful before?3. Influencer spam and paid promotions One day, no one’s talking about a particular coin — the next, your feed is flooded with influencers hyping it up. Sound familiar?This sudden burst of attention is often coordinated with a paid promotion campaign disguised as “genuine enthusiasm.”Many influencers fail to disclose sponsorships, even though it’s required by law in many countries. The US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have cracked down on this in recent years.Take, for example:Kim Kardashian, who was fined $1.26 million in 2022 for promoting EthereumMax without proper disclosure.Floyd Mayweather Jr., who was sued for endorsing the same project at a paid event.BitBoy (Ben Armstrong), who faced legal action in multiple lawsuits for promoting scam tokens to his audience.If you notice multiple influencers promoting the same project in a short time, especially without using labels like #ad or #sponsored, it’s a strong indicator of a shill campaign.Don’t mistake volume for value. Hype doesn’t equal legitimacy.4. No real product or roadmapIf you visit the project’s website, it looks sleek, maybe even impressive. But where’s the product? Where’s the code?Shilled tokens often rely on flashy marketing but have no working application, no GitHub code and no actual use case. Everything is either “coming soon” or buried behind vague promises.Ask yourself:Can I use the platform or app today?Is there a white paper that makes sense?Do they have public repositories or open development?If all you’re seeing is a landing page and a vague roadmap that’s been “coming soon” for months, that’s a major red flag.5. Pressure tactics and FOMO Time pressure is a psychological weapon, and shillers know how to use it.Watch out for lines such as:“Presale ends in 2 hours!”“Only 1,000 spots left!”“If you don’t buy now, you’ll miss out forever!”These tactics prey on your fear of missing out (FOMO) and push you into making impulsive decisions without research.But crypto isn’t a sprint; it’s a long-term game. Anyone trying to rush you into buying likely has something to hide. Solid investments don’t need fake urgency.Take a breath, step back, and ask yourself: Am I buying because I believe in this project or because I’m being manipulated?Did you know? The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) secured a $128-million judgment against Ryan Mitchell Pope, Daniel Samuel Bishop and their company EmpiresX for operating a fraudulent forex and cryptocurrency investment scheme that defrauded over 12,500 victims.                  Is shilling illegal in crypto? Can influencers be sued?              Shilling isn’t just unethical in many cases — it’s also illegal.In the world of crypto, undisclosed promotions are a major legal risk. If someone is paid to promote a token or project but fails to reveal that financial connection, they could face fines, lawsuits or even criminal charges. This is especially true if the promoted token is later classified as a security under US law.Regulators like the SEC, FTC and CFTC have all cracked down on this behavior. Their targets have included:Influencers who failed to disclose paid promotionsPromoters who misled investors with false claimsIndividuals who ran pump-and-dump schemes using social media.Francier Obando Pinillo, a pastor from Miami, was indicted on 26 fraud counts for running a crypto scam through “Solano Fi,” defrauding investors of millions from 2021 to 2023. He allegedly used his church, social media and false promises of 34.9% monthly returns to lure victims. The platform showed fake gains but blocked withdrawals, while funds were diverted for personal use. Pinillo was arraigned in Richland, Washington and faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.As crypto becomes more mainstream, expect stricter regulations and more consequences for shillers.Did you know? Argentine President Javier Milei has dissolved the special task force investigating the LIBRA cryptocurrency scandal, a project he promoted in February 2025 that surged to a $4.5-billion valuation before crashing by over 97%. The task force, created by Milei himself, was disbanded via Decree 332/2025, citing that it had fulfilled its purpose. However, critics argue that no official findings were released, and judicial investigations into Milei and his associates continue.                  How to protect yourself from shilling scams              Do your own research, verify the team and utility, ignore hype and influencers, and stay alert to pump-and-dump schemes to avoid crypto shilling traps.Let’s understand how you can protect yourself from shilling scams in crypto:Do your own research (DYOR): Always research the project, the team behind it and the data supporting the claims. Don’t rely solely on hype or influencer recommendations. Look into onchain data, GitHub activity and the project’s utility to make informed decisions.Verify the team: A legitimate crypto project should have a transparent and credible team. If the developers are anonymous or have no professional profiles (like LinkedIn), that’s a red flag. Always check the team’s past projects and credibility before investing.Look for real utility: Does this project actually solve a problem? A genuine project should have a working product or solution, not just promises. Avoid projects that lack real-world utility or are still in “coming soon” stages for extended periods.Ignore the hype: If a token is suddenly trending on social media or being aggressively promoted, don’t let FOMO influence your judgment. Shillers often rely on emotions to push their agenda, so it’s essential to evaluate projects based on their merits, not just popularity.Stay skeptical of influencers: Influencers with large followings may be paid to promote certain tokens. Before taking their advice, ask yourself, What’s their incentive? Verify the promotion is legitimate and disclosed as paid or sponsored. Always cross-check the information with independent sources.Watch for pump-and-dump schemes: Be cautious of sudden price spikes followed by rapid drops. These are often signs of pump-and-dump schemes where the token’s value is artificially inflated by coordinated buying and then quickly sold off, leaving investors with losses. Always monitor price trends and be wary of sudden, unexplained increases in value.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/5-red-flags-youre-being-shilled-dont-buy-the-hype?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The steps include a new, trustless architecture, a native token, and the Seeker ship date.According to the announcement, Solana Mobile will ship the device starting Aug. 4. Seeker is the company’s second-generation device, after the Saga Web3 phone that launched in April 2023. The company unveiled the Seeker phone in September 2024, saying it wouldn’t just be a “memecoin phone.” So far, it has pre-sold 150,000 units.The Solana Seeker has gone through two sale phases: The Founder window, where the price for each device was $450, and the Early Adopter window, where the price per device was $500. Assuming the lower price window, Solana Mobile could generate at least $67.5 million in gross revenue from device sales. For comparison, the iPhone generated $199.3 billion in revenue for Apple in 2024.The new architecture that will govern future Solana Mobile devices is called TEEPIN, which stands for “Trusted Execution Environment Platform Infrastructure Network.” It is a three-layer architecture — hardware, platform, and network layers — that will allow users, developers, and device makers to participate in a trustless environment.Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder and CEO of Solana Labs, called TEEPIN “the next evolution in mobile” and a framework where trust is “verified by cryptography.”In addition, Solana Mobile is planning to launch “SKR,” the native asset of the Solana Mobile ecosystem. \""It transforms the traditional mobile business model by giving stakeholders actual ownership in the platform,” said Emmett Hollyer, general manager at Solana Mobile.

Some units were listed on eBay for thousands of dollars, driven by growing demand. By December 2023, the Saga had completely sold out.Magazine: Memecoins are ded — But Solana ‘100x better’ despite revenue plunge",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-mobile-reveals-trustless-architecture-native-token-for-seeker-device?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-21T20:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin hits new highs in the absence of ‘unhealthy’ leverage use — Will the rally continue?","Key takeaways:Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows and low leverage suggest the BTC rally has room to grow.US Federal Reserve liquidity and weak bond sales support a Bitcoin push beyond $110,000.Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to sustain its bullish momentum after reaching a new all-time high of $109,827 on May 21, which led traders to question whether derivatives markets mainly drove the rally. From a broad perspective, the $77 billion in Bitcoin futures open interest has undoubtedly played a role. However, a closer look at the data shows a more positive outlook for further price gains.Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.chThe current 7% annualized Bitcoin futures premium is well within the neutral range of 5% to 10%, which has been typical for the past two weeks. This indicator can easily exceed 30% during periods of strong optimism, so the current level is relatively low. At the same time, the absence of excessive leverage reduces concerns about a rally driven primarily by derivatives.Balanced order books and spot Bitcoin ETF inflows point to spot-driven rallyFor comparison, during the previous Bitcoin $109,346 all-time high on Jan. 20, the annualized futures premium reached 15%, showing a much higher level of leveraged bullish positions affecting the price. Therefore, the current Bitcoin derivatives market appears healthier, suggesting strong demand in spot markets.During the January bull run, Bitcoin’s price on Coinbase traded at a premium compared to other exchanges. This so-called Coinbase premium is not present now, which means buying pressure is more evenly spread out—a sign of a healthier market.Coinbase Bitcoin/USD relative to competitors. Source: TradingView / CointelegraphWhile excessive buying pressure on a single exchange is not necessarily bearish, it can make it easier to trigger unsustainable price surges when liquidity is low. This data supports the idea that derivatives markets were not the main driver of the recent price increases. Moreover, the $1.37 billion in net inflows to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States between May 15 and May 20 further suggests that spot buyers, rather than derivatives traders, were the primary force behind the rally.Despite the lack of conviction in Bitcoin futures, several indicators point to further upside. Forced liquidations of bearish BTC futures positions were relatively low at $170 million between May 18 and May 21, cementing the idea of a spot-driven rally. In comparison, the rally to $104,000 on May 9 triggered $538 million in liquidations over three days.Related: Is Bitcoin price close to a cycle top? — 5 indicators that help traders decideBitcoin options put-to-call ratio at Deribit.

For comparison, the put-to-call ratio at Deribit dropped to 0.4x during the previous bull run on Jan. 20, reflecting lower confidence due to reduced volumes in call (buy) options.Bitcoin’s upward movement may have been limited by macroeconomic factors, especially as the tariff war continues. Still, the potential for the price to reach $110,000 and higher is partly based on the weak position of the US Federal Reserve.
