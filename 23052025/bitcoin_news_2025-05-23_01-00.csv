2025-05-22T22:50:10.000Z,"Mantle mETH Achieves Historic Public Company Milestone","BitcoinWorld Mantle mETH Achieves Historic Public Company Milestone Get ready for a significant moment in the world of digital assets! A groundbreaking development has just unfolded, showcasing the increasing integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional finance. Mantle mETH, the liquid staking token from the Mantle Network, has achieved a historic first by being included on the balance sheet of a publicly traded company. This move by Beyond Medical Technologies, through its Ethereum treasury managed by Republic Technologies, marks a pivotal step for Liquid Staking Tokens and signals a potential shift in how public companies approach their treasury strategies. What is Mantle mETH and Why is it Making Waves? Before diving into the significance of this news, let’s quickly touch upon what Mantle mETH is. Mantle is a high-performance Ethereum Layer 2 network. mETH is Mantle’s Liquid Staking Token (LST), representing staked ETH on the Ethereum network while remaining liquid and usable within the DeFi ecosystem and beyond. Essentially, when you stake ETH, it’s typically locked. LSTs like mETH allow holders to earn staking rewards while still having a token they can trade, lend, or use in other decentralized applications. The reason Mantle mETH is making waves is precisely because of its recent adoption by a public company. This isn’t just another crypto project; it’s a project whose token has now entered the realm of traditional corporate finance, setting a precedent. The Significance: A Public Company Crypto Breakthrough? This news is huge because it represents the first time a publicly listed company has formally included a Liquid Staking Token on its balance sheet. While some public companies hold Bitcoin or Ethereum directly, holding an LST is a different ballgame. It indicates a deeper understanding and willingness to engage with more complex, yield-generating crypto assets. Beyond Medical Technologies (CSE: DOCT), through its Republic Technologies subsidiary, is the company making this bold move. By converting a significant portion of its existing ETH holdings into Mantle mETH, they are actively pursuing an Ethereum-based Crypto Treasury Strategy that aims to potentially generate yield on their assets while maintaining a degree of liquidity. Why is being the ‘first’ so important? It often paves the way for others. This action by Beyond Medical Technologies could serve as a case study or even a catalyst for other public companies considering how to manage their digital asset holdings more actively and efficiently. It lends an air of legitimacy and growing acceptance to LSTs within traditional financial frameworks. How Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) are Changing Treasury Strategy Traditionally, companies holding assets like cash or bonds aim for stability and potentially yield. With the advent of crypto, companies like MicroStrategy pioneered holding Bitcoin as a reserve asset. However, holding passive crypto assets doesn’t generate yield in the way traditional fixed-income assets might. This is where Liquid Staking Token s like Mantle mETH come into play. For companies holding Ethereum, they face a choice: Hold ETH passively (potential price appreciation, but no native yield). Stake ETH directly (earn yield, but ETH is locked and illiquid). Hold an LST like mETH (earn staking yield *and* retain liquidity). By opting for mETH, Republic Technologies is demonstrating a sophisticated Crypto Treasury Strategy . They are not just holding ETH; they are actively seeking to maximize the utility and potential returns on their digital assets by participating in the staking mechanism through a liquid wrapper. This allows them flexibility that direct staking doesn’t offer, such as potentially using the mETH as collateral or swapping it quickly if needed, while still benefiting from the underlying ETH staking rewards. What This Means for Institutional Crypto Adoption This move by a public company is a significant indicator for broader Institutional Crypto Adoption . Institutions often move cautiously, waiting for precedents and clearer regulatory landscapes. While Beyond Medical Technologies is perhaps not a Fortune 500 giant, their decision to hold an LST on their balance sheet sends a strong signal: Increased Comfort Level: It shows a growing comfort among corporate entities with more complex DeFi primitives beyond just holding spot crypto. Focus on Yield: It highlights that institutions are interested not just in speculative price action but also in generating yield from their digital assets, similar to traditional finance. Validation for LSTs: It validates the LST market as a legitimate and potentially valuable sector for corporate involvement. Paving the Way: As mentioned, it could encourage other companies, perhaps larger ones, to explore similar strategies once they see a public company successfully implementing it. While we are still in the early innings of widespread Institutional Crypto Adoption , events like this are crucial steps that build confidence and familiarity with the technology and its potential benefits. Benefits and Considerations for Companies Holding mETH Let’s break down some of the potential upsides and downsides for a company deciding to hold a Liquid Staking Token like Mantle mETH. Potential Benefits: Yield Generation: Earn staking rewards on underlying ETH holdings. Liquidity: Unlike directly staked ETH, mETH can be traded or used in DeFi protocols, offering flexibility. Diversification: Adds a new asset class and yield source to the corporate balance sheet. Potential Appreciation: Benefits from potential price increases in both ETH and potentially the mETH token itself relative to ETH (though the latter is designed to track ETH value plus yield). Alignment with Ethereum Strategy: For companies already invested in the Ethereum ecosystem, holding mETH aligns with and enhances that position. Important Considerations & Risks: Market Volatility: The value of mETH is tied to ETH, which is highly volatile. Smart Contract Risk: LSTs rely on complex smart contracts. Bugs or exploits could lead to loss of funds. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory status of LSTs and corporate crypto holdings is still evolving in many jurisdictions. Operational Complexity: Managing digital assets requires specialized knowledge, security protocols, and accounting practices. Depeg Risk: While LSTs are designed to trade close to the value of staked ETH, they can sometimes trade at a discount or premium (depeg risk). For Beyond Medical Technologies, the decision likely involved weighing these factors as part of their overall Crypto Treasury Strategy . Looking Ahead: The Future of LSTs in Corporate Finance The integration of Mantle mETH onto a public company’s balance sheet is more than just a single event; it’s a potential harbinger of future trends. As the LST market matures and becomes more robust, and as regulatory clarity hopefully improves, we might see more companies exploring similar strategies. The appeal of earning yield on otherwise passive crypto holdings is significant, especially in a low-interest-rate environment (or when compared to zero yield on passive crypto). This move by Beyond Medical Technologies, facilitated by Republic Technologies and Mantle, positions LSTs as a viable tool within a sophisticated Crypto Treasury Strategy for forward-thinking companies. While widespread Public Company Crypto adoption of LSTs is not guaranteed, this milestone is undoubtedly a step in that direction, showcasing the potential for DeFi innovations to bridge the gap with traditional corporate finance. Summary: A Historic Step for Mantle mETH and LSTs In conclusion, Mantle mETH has achieved a historic first by becoming the inaugural Liquid Staking Token to be held on the balance sheet of a publicly traded company, Beyond Medical Technologies, through its Republic Technologies subsidiary. This move represents a sophisticated Crypto Treasury Strategy aimed at generating yield while retaining liquidity on their ETH holdings. It is a significant milestone for Institutional Crypto Adoption and validation for the LST sector, potentially paving the way for other companies to explore similar uses of Public Company Crypto assets. While challenges remain, this event underscores the growing maturity and potential of DeFi technologies to integrate with traditional finance.

2025-05-22T22:35:24.000Z,"Ethereum’s trillion-dollar rebrand masks deep trouble as Solana eats its lunch","Ethereum is trying to clean up its image just as it’s losing its grip. The Ethereum Foundation launched a campaign in 2025 called the “Trillion Dollar Security Initiative” to promote the blockchain as the only serious option for securing real-world value. But the effort comes at a time when the project is slipping across the board, from price performance to user attention and developer support, while Solana is gaining fast. The message coming from Ethereum’s leadership is all about stability, uptime, and security. But Ether, the token that runs on it, hasn’t kept up with Bitcoin since the Merge upgrade was rolled out in 2022. The gap has only widened. The Ether-to-Bitcoin price ratio has stayed on a downward slope since then, and Ethereum has struggled to pull in new interest even as it added new tech upgrades. Instead of regaining momentum, it has seen core users and builders Ethereum’s leadership walk away. Solana gains traction while Ethereum loses ground In 2024, Solana’s active developer count jumped by 83%, while Ethereum’s dropped by 17%, data from Electric Capital showed. Cheaper fees and better user experience on Solana have pulled in a younger crowd that’s more focused on speed, memecoins, and new ideas than Ethereum’s long-term vision. That same audience drove Solana’s price to an all-time high earlier this year while Ether stayed mostly flat. Ethereum’s ecosystem has gotten too fragmented, and developers are opting out of dealing with Layer-2 rollups like Base and Arbitrum just to get basic dApps running. Even the Ethereum Foundation’s own move to promote security is being questioned. Katie Talati, head of research at Arca, said the new initiative was less of a breakthrough and more of a branding effort. “This feels more like a marketing repositioning from the Ethereum Foundation than an actual technical innovation,” Katie said . “I don’t believe that this announcement alone will be enough to recapture developer and user mindshare. But over the long term, a greater focus on security guarantees via improvements to UX/UI will attract more developers. Users, however, only come when there is something interesting to use.” Part of Ethereum’s current struggle comes from its scaling progress. After the Dencun upgrade last year, Ethereum did make progress on moving activity off the main chain. But most of that activity landed on Layer-2s. The core network hasn’t kept that momentum, and as a result, Ether’s burn rate has dropped. That weakens the coin’s previous deflationary pitch, one of the key reasons investors used to hold it in the first place. Wall Street push fails to spark interest in Ether ETFs Now, Ethereum’s leaders are chasing attention in Washington and on Wall Street. A group called Etherealize, formed with support from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and led by researcher Vivek Raman, is focused on lobbying for the blockchain’s future in traditional finance. Vivek explained the strategy in an email, saying, “We speak to TradFi and Wall Street players all day and in the end — a blockchain’s security is the most important quality to ensure trust.” He added that Ethereum’s role will be as “digital oil” to complement Bitcoin’s role as “digital gold.” That narrative hasn’t worked out well so far. In 2025, spot Ether ETFs in the US saw $42 million in net outflows. At the same time, Bitcoin ETFs brought in $8 billion across a dozen funds. Institutions seem more interested in returns and yield than Ethereum’s security pitch. Ethereum’s roadmap hasn’t been convincing enough to pull serious capital out of Bitcoin’s orbit. At the same time, Michael Saylor’s firm MicroStrategy is going all-in on Bitcoin again. His company just announced it would sell $2.1 billion worth of 10% “perpetual strife” preferred stock to buy more Bitcoin. That kind of headline doesn’t help Ethereum’s case. When one chain is pulling in billions through aggressive buying strategies, and the other is launching rebrands to chase institutional money that isn’t even arriving, the contrast is sharp.

2025-05-22T22:30:49.000Z,"US Crypto Regulation: Crucial House Crypto Bill Markup Set for June 10","BitcoinWorld US Crypto Regulation: Crucial House Crypto Bill Markup Set for June 10 The wheels of legislative progress continue to turn in Washington D.C. for the digital asset space. A significant date has been set for those closely watching the development of US crypto regulation: June 10. This is when the U.S. House of Representatives is scheduled to hold a markup session for its proposed House crypto bill, aimed at establishing a clear regulatory framework for the industry. This news, shared by Crypto in America host Eleanor Terrett on X, marks a tangible step forward in the ongoing effort to define cryptocurrency law in the United States and shape the future crypto market structure. What is the House Crypto Bill and Why Does it Matter for US Crypto Regulation? The proposed House crypto bill, often referred to as a market structure bill, is a bipartisan effort primarily driven by members of the House Financial Services Committee and potentially the House Agriculture Committee, given the dual nature of some digital assets being seen as both securities and commodities. Its main goal is to provide regulatory clarity for the digital asset ecosystem in the U.S. Currently, the lack of a unified federal approach means different agencies, notably the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), assert jurisdiction over various aspects of the crypto market. This has led to uncertainty, conflicting guidance, and a perception within the industry that the U.S. is lagging behind other jurisdictions in establishing predictable US crypto regulation. The House crypto bill aims to address this by: Defining which digital assets fall under which regulatory body’s purview. Establishing rules for crypto exchanges, brokers, and other intermediaries. Setting standards for consumer protection and market integrity. Providing a framework for stablecoins. Passing this bill would be a significant development, potentially unlocking greater institutional investment, fostering innovation domestically, and providing much-needed legal certainty for businesses operating in the space. It represents a concerted effort by lawmakers to move beyond enforcement actions towards proactive cryptocurrency lawmaking. Understanding the Crypto Bill Markup Process: What Happens on June 10? Setting a date for a crypto bill markup is a crucial procedural step in the legislative journey. A markup session is when a congressional committee reviews, debates, and amends a proposed bill. It’s a detailed, often lengthy process where committee members offer amendments to the bill’s text. Here’s what typically happens during a markup: Introduction: The committee chair formally introduces the bill. Discussion: Committee members discuss the bill’s provisions, potential impacts, and areas of concern. Amendments: Members propose amendments to change the bill. These amendments are debated and voted upon by the committee. Vote: After all amendments are considered, the committee votes on the final version of the bill. If it passes the committee vote, it is then sent to the full House floor for further consideration and debate. The crypto bill markup on June 10 is the opportunity for the House Financial Services Committee (and potentially others involved) to refine the House crypto bill based on feedback, negotiations, and differing perspectives within the committee. The outcome of this session will determine the exact text of the bill that could potentially move forward for a full House vote. The Long Road to US Crypto Regulation: Context and Challenges The path to comprehensive US crypto regulation has been challenging and slow. Multiple factors contribute to this difficulty: Novelty and Complexity: Digital assets are a rapidly evolving technology that doesn’t fit neatly into existing financial regulations designed for traditional assets. Jurisdictional Disputes: As mentioned, the SEC and CFTC have differing views on how digital assets should be classified and regulated. Political Polarization: While there is some bipartisan support for creating a framework, disagreements exist on the specifics, particularly regarding the balance between innovation, consumer protection, and financial stability. Lobbying and Industry Input: The crypto industry, consumer groups, and traditional finance firms all lobby lawmakers, presenting diverse and sometimes conflicting viewpoints. Previous attempts at establishing clear cryptocurrency law have stalled or failed to gain sufficient traction. This makes the scheduled crypto bill markup a notable moment, indicating a renewed push to move legislation forward in the current congressional term. Potential Impact on the Crypto Market Structure The eventual passage of a House crypto bill could profoundly impact the crypto market structure in the United States. A clear legal and regulatory framework could: Increase Institutional Adoption: Large financial institutions are often hesitant to engage deeply with crypto due to regulatory uncertainty. Clear rules could provide the confidence needed for broader participation. Enhance Consumer Protection: The bill is expected to include provisions aimed at protecting retail investors from fraud and manipulation, potentially increasing trust in regulated platforms. Foster Domestic Innovation: With clear rules, crypto startups might be more inclined to build and operate in the U.S. rather than seeking friendlier jurisdictions abroad. Define Asset Classes: A key outcome could be a clearer legal definition of when a digital asset is a security (regulated by the SEC) versus a commodity (regulated by the CFTC). However, challenges remain. Critics worry that poorly designed US crypto regulation could stifle innovation through overly burdensome compliance requirements or definitions that don’t accurately reflect the technology. The specifics hammered out during the crypto bill markup and subsequent legislative steps will be critical in determining whether the bill achieves its intended positive outcomes for the crypto market structure. Stakeholders and Perspectives on Cryptocurrency Law Various groups have vested interests and differing views on the development of cryptocurrency law: Crypto Industry: Generally advocates for clear, tailored rules that recognize the unique nature of digital assets, often preferring CFTC oversight for many tokens. They seek a framework that encourages innovation and provides a level playing field. Traditional Finance: Some institutions see crypto as a new asset class and want clear rules to participate, while others may view it as a threat or competitor and support stricter regulations. Regulators (SEC/CFTC): The SEC has largely favored regulating many tokens as securities under existing law, while the CFTC has viewed Bitcoin and Ethereum as commodities. The bill aims to provide legislative direction to resolve some of these turf wars. Consumer Advocates: Focus on protecting investors from scams, fraud, and market manipulation, generally supporting robust oversight and disclosure requirements. Lawmakers: Republicans have generally pushed for legislation providing clarity and limiting what they see as regulation by enforcement, while Democrats have often emphasized strong consumer protection and addressing potential systemic risks. The crypto bill markup is where these differing perspectives within the committee will clash and compromise, attempting to forge a version of the House crypto bill that can garner enough support to move forward. Actionable Insights: How to Stay Informed For anyone involved in or interested in the crypto space, staying informed about the progress of the House crypto bill and broader US crypto regulation is essential. Here are some steps you can take: Follow Reputable News Sources: Keep an eye on financial news outlets, crypto-specific news sites, and reports from organizations tracking legislative developments. Monitor Committee Activities: The House Financial Services Committee website is a primary source for information on hearing schedules, bill text, and markup outcomes. Understand the Bill’s Details: As the bill progresses, read summaries or the text itself to understand its potential impact on specific assets or activities you’re interested in. Engage with Your Representatives: Contacting your members of Congress to share your views on the importance of clear, effective cryptocurrency law can be impactful. The June 10 crypto bill markup is just one step, but a significant one, in a potentially long legislative process that includes votes in the full House, consideration in the Senate, and potentially conference committees to reconcile differences between House and Senate versions before a bill can become law. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for US Crypto Regulation The scheduling of the crypto bill markup for June 10 is a tangible indicator that U.S. lawmakers are actively working towards establishing a comprehensive framework for US crypto regulation. This session represents a critical juncture where the details of the proposed House crypto bill will be debated, amended, and potentially advanced. While the path to final cryptocurrency law is still long and uncertain, this markup is a necessary step in providing the clarity and structure needed for the future growth and stability of the crypto market structure in the United States. All eyes will be on the committee on June 10 to see how this pivotal session unfolds.

2025-05-22T22:30:43.000Z,"XRP Ledger Breaks Ground With Its First MiCA-Regulated Euro Stablecoin","Schuman Financial’s EURØP today became the first euro-denominated stablecoin that both satisfies the European Union’s new Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regime and lives natively on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Launched from Paris on 22 May, the milestone ties MiCA-grade legal certainty to a blockchain that has already settled more than 3.3 billion transactions during its 12-year lifespan. “EURØP on the XRPL combines the resilience of a global blockchain with euro-native liquidity and compliance at its core. This will give Europe and euro-denominated financial markets an integral infrastructure for the next wave of financial innovation, which is happening on-chain,” said Martin Bruncko, Schuman Financial’s founder and CEO, in the announcement . XRP Ledger And Why MiCA Status Matters MiCA’s stablecoin provisions—covering e-money tokens (EMT) such as EURØP—took effect on 30 June 2024. They require full 1:1 fiat backing, daily redeemability, bankruptcy-remote reserves and authorisation by an EU regulator. The French ACPR has licensed Schuman Financial as an EMT issuer, while KPMG audits its reserve assets held at Société Générale and other top-tier banks. Only a handful of issuers have so far cleared MiCA’s bar: Circle’s USDC and EURC, Société Générale’s EURCV, and a dozen niche projects. But EURØP is the first to bring that regulatory pedigree to XRPL, whose native DEX, fast finality and low fees historically attracted IOU-based fiat tokens yet lacked a MiCA-compliant euro coin. Euro stablecoins represent barely 0.15 % of the $232 billion global stablecoin float—roughly $338 million as of end-April 2025—yet they have become a strategic priority for European banks and fintechs now that MiCA offers a passportable legal framework. For payment firms and corporate treasurers, EURØP offers a programmable settlement asset that can move in three to five seconds at fractions of a cent while retaining full EU regulatory coverage. Schuman Financial says the token will underpin DeFi lending pools, automated foreign-exchange corridors, and on-chain euro legs for tokenized r eal-world-asset (RWA) trades —use cases that MiCA expressly contemplates once issuers file a “significant” EMT designation with the European Banking Authority. Cassie Craddock, Ripple’s Managing Director for UK & Europe, framed the launch as validation of ledger’s enterprise strategy: “The launch of EURØP on the XRP Ledger demonstrates how stablecoins can meet the high standards set by MiCA while unlocking new possibilities for on-chain payments and RWA tokenization.

2025-05-22T22:10:30.000Z,"Crypto Whale Scores Massive $23.7M ETH Profit While Holding Bitcoin Fortune","BitcoinWorld Crypto Whale Scores Massive $23.7M ETH Profit While Holding Bitcoin Fortune The world of cryptocurrency is often moved by the actions of its largest players – the so-called ‘whales.’ These are individuals or entities holding vast amounts of digital assets, and their trades can send ripples across the market. Recently, one such crypto whale executed a remarkable maneuver, netting tens of millions in profit from Ethereum while maintaining a substantial position in Bitcoin. Who is This Mysterious Crypto Whale and What Did They Buy? Tracking the movements of a large crypto investor can offer valuable insights into market sentiment and potential trends. According to on-chain data shared by Lookonchain on X, a specific whale made a significant move on April 27th. This investor acquired a massive portfolio via over-the-counter (OTC) transactions, ensuring minimal market disruption during the purchase. The acquisition included: 30,000 ETH: Purchased for $54.9 million, averaging out to a price of $1,830 per ETH. 600 BTC: Acquired for $56.94 million, at an average price of $94,900 per BTC. This initial outlay demonstrates the sheer scale of capital deployed by this crypto whale , signaling strong conviction in both Ethereum and Bitcoin at the time of purchase. Cashing In: The Impressive ETH Profit While holding both assets for a period, the whale recently decided to take profits on their Ethereum position. This isn’t just any profit; it’s a staggering gain that highlights the potential returns in volatile crypto markets when timed effectively. The investor sold their entire holding of 30,000 ETH for a total of $78.63 million. Let’s break down the impressive ETH profit : Transaction Amount Price per Unit Total Value Purchase (ETH) 30,000 ETH $1,830 $54.9 million Sale (ETH) 30,000 ETH $2,621 $78.63 million Realized Profit – – $23.73 million This realized gain of $23.73 million represents a return of approximately 43% on the initial ETH investment in a relatively short timeframe. It’s a prime example of a successful crypto trading execution by a large player. The Unsold Bitcoin Holdings: Awaiting Further Gains? Interestingly, despite realizing significant gains on Ethereum, the whale has opted to hold onto their Bitcoin position. The 600 BTC acquired alongside the ETH remain in the investor’s wallet. As of the latest report from Lookonchain, these Bitcoin holdings are currently valued at $66.5 million. Comparing this to the initial purchase price of $56.94 million, the whale is sitting on a substantial unrealized gain of $9.6 million from their BTC position alone. This decision to sell ETH but hold BTC suggests a potentially different outlook or strategy for the two leading cryptocurrencies. Analyzing the Crypto Trading Strategy What can we infer from this crypto trading pattern? Selling ETH while holding BTC could indicate several things: Profit Taking & Risk Management: The whale might have viewed the ETH rally as a good opportunity to lock in substantial profits, perhaps de-risking their overall portfolio while maintaining exposure to Bitcoin, which they might believe has further upside potential. Different Time Horizons: The investor might have had a shorter-term target for ETH and a longer-term view for BTC. Market Signal: While not definitive, such large-scale selling of one asset and holding of another by a significant player is often watched closely by the market for potential signals. This case study provides a fascinating glimpse into the high-stakes world of a large crypto investor navigating the market. What Can We Learn from This Large Crypto Investor? While most individual traders don’t operate on this scale, the actions of a large crypto investor like this whale offer valuable lessons: The Importance of Strategy: This wasn’t a random trade; it involved a large OTC purchase and a strategic sale. Having a plan is crucial. Profit Realization: Knowing when to take profits is just as important as knowing when to buy. The whale didn’t wait for the absolute peak (if there was one yet) but locked in a significant gain. Portfolio Allocation: The decision to hold one asset while selling another highlights how investors view different cryptocurrencies within their portfolio. Tracking Whales: While not always predictive, monitoring the moves of significant wallets can provide context for market movements. This event underscores the dynamic nature of the crypto market and the potential for substantial returns, as demonstrated by this whale’s impressive ETH profit . Conclusion The recent activity of this prominent crypto whale serves as a compelling narrative in the ongoing saga of digital asset markets. By strategically acquiring and then partially liquidating positions, this large crypto investor secured a remarkable $23.73 million ETH profit . Their continued holding of substantial Bitcoin holdings , currently sitting on significant unrealized gains, suggests a calculated approach to their portfolio, employing distinct strategies for different assets. This instance of high-stakes crypto trading offers valuable insights into how major players navigate volatility and capitalize on market movements, reminding us of the exciting opportunities present in the cryptocurrency space.

2025-05-22T22:00:48.000Z,"Bitcoin Tops $111K — Yet MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP Are Capturing the Market’s Imagination With Superior Upside","As the cryptocurrency market surges into mid-2025, Bitcoin’s historic climb above $111,000 has grabbed global attention. Yet, beneath the surface of this milestone, a dynamic shift is underway. Investors are increasingly drawn to select altcoins that promise not just stability, but transformative returns. Meanwhile, Ethereum and Avalanche remain solid performers, but it’s the early-stage and narrative-driven assets that are commanding the spotlight. Among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a standout, drawing attention for its early-stage momentum and potential for outsized returns—making it a top contender for those seeking the next big crypto success story 5000% ROI STILL ON THE TABLE – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Phenomenon Poised for Explosive Growth MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly establishing itself as the premier presale opportunity of 2025. With over $8 million raised and a listing target of $0.007, the project is drawing both retail and institutional interest ahead of its exchange debut. Analysts are projecting returns of 25x–35x from current entry points, with some models pointing to even greater upside if demand remains robust. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Stands Out: Scarcity-Driven Model: Capped supply and audited contracts ensure transparency and value preservation. Narrative Strength: A politically charged brand and loyal community are driving organic growth and media traction. Early-Stage Momentum: With Stage 8 nearing completion, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers one of the last ground-floor entry points before public price discovery. Strategic Positioning: The project’s roadmap and token utility are resonating with investors seeking asymmetric returns. MAGACOIN FINANCE is a strategic early-stage play that could rival the early days of SHIBA INU and DOGE, but with a more transparent and structured approach. Bitcoin: Institutional Surge and Record Highs Bitcoin’s latest ascent is powered by unprecedented institutional inflows, with U.S. spot ETFs attracting billions in fresh capital and major financial institutions expanding their crypto exposure. Analysts forecast that BTC could climb to $116,000–$137,000 in the near term, with long-term models suggesting even higher ceilings if current momentum persists. Yet, as Bitcoin’s rally stabilizes, a growing share of capital is rotating toward altcoins with higher-multiple potential—and MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its presale structure and community-driven growth, is perfectly positioned to capture this wave of interest XRP: Institutional Validation and Price Projections XRP has surged from $1.75 in April to its current range of $2.40–$2.65, buoyed by regulatory clarity and anticipation of new institutional products. Analysts now see a clear path toward $5–$10, with some bullish scenarios targeting $15 or higher if ETF approvals and global adoption accelerate. XRP’s combination of real-world utility and institutional backing makes it a top pick for those seeking both stability and significant upside. While XRP remains a core institutional asset, its upside is increasingly being matched by the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE, which continues to attract early adopters looking for the next crypto breakout Ethereum: Steady Growth Amid Market Rotation Ethereum trades between $2,550–$2,600 and remains the backbone of decentralized finance and Web3, with ongoing upgrades and institutional adoption supporting its price. However, after a robust rally, ETH’s momentum has moderated, and some investors are shifting toward early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper returns. With its transparent tokenomics and rapid presale progress, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a compelling alternative for those seeking the next wave of crypto innovation. Avalanche: Institutional Interest and Technical Strength Avalanche is seeing steady adoption and trades averagely at $22, with notable integrations from major institutions and a growing presence in DeFi and gaming. While AVAX is a dependable hold, its near-term upside is less dramatic compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. The latter’s aggressive community-led growth and record-setting capital inflows make it the clear choice for investors targeting high-multiple opportunities before listings Solana: Layer-1 Leader, but Momentum Shifts Trading at $170–$175, solana continues to lead among Layer-1 platforms, with strong DeFi usage and developer activity. After a period of rapid appreciation, SOL’s price growth has moderated, prompting some investors to seek higher-multiple opportunities elsewhere. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its structured presale and clear path to exchange listings, offers a unique chance to participate in a project poised for explosive expansion as the cycle progresses CLICK HERE – $0.007 LISTING COMING FAST Final Thoughts Bitcoin’s record-breaking rally is a landmark event, but the most compelling opportunities may lie elsewhere. MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP are capturing the market’s imagination with their unique value propositions and potential for outsized gains. With MAGACOIN’s presale nearing completion and XRP’s institutional momentum building, these assets are poised to lead the next wave of crypto market growth. For investors seeking transformative returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the breakout opportunity of 2025.

2025-05-22T22:00:26.000Z,"Here’s what happened in crypto today","Today in crypto, US lawmakers are drafting an amendment to the GENIUS Act to bar sitting presidents from profiting off stablecoins. Sui-based decentralized exchange Cetus has been exploited, losing more than $200 million. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has broken past the $110,000 mark for the first time. Senators plan to amend GENIUS Act to address Trump family's stablecoin Though a majority of members of the US Senate voted to advance a bill to regulate payment stablecoins on May 20, high-ranking Democrats are planning to propose an amendment to the legislation to address President Donald Trump’s connections to the cryptocurrency industry. According to a May 22 Axios report, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senators Elizabeth Warren and Jeff Merkley will file an amendment to the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act, or GENIUS Act, to block a US president from profiting from stablecoins. The proposed amendment would come after 18 Democrats sided with Republicans in the Senate in voting to advance the bill on May 20 after it failed a procedural vote on May 8. “Passing the GENIUS Act without our anti-corruption amendment stamps a Congressional seal of approval on Trump selling access and influence to the highest bidder,” Merkley said in a May 22 X post. Trump his three sons are involved in the crypto platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI), which launched its USD1 stablecoin in March. Critics have pointed out that the president could continue to personally benefit from legislation that helps recognize stablecoins like USD1 as financial instruments in the US. Sui DEX Cetus hit by suspected hack: Over $200 million in potential losses Cetus, a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Sui blockchain, is suspected to have been hit by a massive exploit that may have drained more than $200 million worth of digital assets. Pseudonymous Web3 researcher COMDARE3 posted on X that “users report” that Sui-based DEX Cetus is being exploited.” They also shared a screenshot of Cetus market data on DEX Screener , showing many assets losing well over half of their value over the last 24 hours. The team behind Extractor, an onchain monitoring tool developed by crypto cybersecurity company Hacken, confirmed that “at least $63m was already bridged to Ethereum, 20k ETH was just transferred to a fresh wallet” in a single transaction . A Hacken representative told Cointelegraph that these findings were confirmed by the company’s Web3 researcher, Yehor Rudytsia. Cetus pool data shows that as of the time of writing, the DEX processed $2.9 billion worth of transactions on May 22, a significant increase over the $320 million reported on May 21. This heightened level of activity may have been caused by funds being siphoned out of the protocol. Cetus did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comments about the suspected exploit. A Sui team representative gave no comment to Cointelegraph regarding the Cetus situation. Some tokens, such as Lombard Staked BTC (LBTC) or AXOLcoin (AXOL) lost most of their value on Cetus. The top 15 losers all lost in excess of three-quarters of their price. Cetus DEX-listed asset pricing data. Source: DEX Screener Bitcoin climbs above $110,000 for the first time Bitcoin ( BTC ) rallied above $110,000 for the first time late on May 21 after it gained over 3% in the past day and continued its rally early into May 22 to a high of nearly $112,000 as of 4 am UTC. The cryptocurrency had well passed a a peak high of $109,458 that it hit earlier in the day, which was the first time it traded above its long-held Jan. 20 peak. Bitcoin has gained around 20% this year and has nearly doubled since its slump to $75,000 on April 7, triggered by US President Donald Trump enacting sweeping tariffs that tanked global markets. Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows it has climbed out of a slump earlier this year.

WLD price is over 86 percent down from its all-time high but rising institutional adoption signals a momentum shift. Worldcoin (WLD) price dominated the top altcoin gainers in the past 24 hours after Bitcoin (BTC) price confirmed the onset of a crypto summer 2025. The mid-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $15.9 billion and a 24-hour average traded volume of around $1 billion, surged over 30 percent on Thursday to trade about $1.59 during the late North American trading session. Following the WLD price rally today, the total Worldcoin futures open interest surged over 67 percent in the past 24 hours to hover about $411 million at the time of this writing. Worldcoin Gets Boost from Institutional Investors The Worldcoin project has grown significantly in the past year catalyzed by the significant adoption of the World App. According to the latest data , the World App has more than 26 million users, with over 12.5 million users having already verified their unique humaneness through the Orb device. Following the notable Worldcoin adoption, the World Foundation announced a $135 million raised funds from a16z and Bain Capital Crypto. Most importantly, the investors purchased WLD tokens directly from the secondary market. Short-Term Targets for WLD Price As with the wider altcoin market, the WLD price has recorded bullish momentum since the first week of April 2025, following the easing of the trade war. In the four-hour time frame, the WLD price has been forming higher highs and higher lows, a characteristic of a rising trend. Following the recent rebound from the established rising logarithmic trend, WLD price is now aiming for the next target range between $2.32 and $4.124. Furthermore, the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) surged above the 70 percent level again, signaling bullish sentiment. Additionally, the daily MACD line has already crossed the zero line amid growing histograms.

2025-05-22T21:48:15.000Z,"Tom Emmer Reintroduces Regulatory Clarity For Crypto Tech Bill","On May 21, Congressman Tom Emmer reintroduced the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act (BRCA), a bipartisan bill co-led with Congressman Ritchie Torres. The bill’s core principle stipulates that if crypto developers and service providers do not hold custody of consumer funds, they shouldn’t be classified as money transmitters under current regulations. The clarification aims to provide legal certainty for blockchain developers, miners, validators, and crypto wallet providers who build non-custodial services. Clarity for Developers, Miners, and Validators The legislation addresses concerns that unclear regulations are pushing American crypto innovation overseas. Both congressmen emphasize that the bill protects innovation while maintaining appropriate oversight, and they have refined the framework based on previous feedback when similar language was rejected in committee. “The longer we delay this commonsense clarification, the greater the risk that this transformative technology is pushed overseas, harming American investors and innovators,” said Emmer . “If we want to keep the next generation of builders in the United States, this kind of legal clarity is essential,” said Torres, who added, “We cannot afford to let outdated or misapplied regulations drive American talent and technology overseas.” Several industry organizations have endorsed the reintroduction, including Coin Center, DeFi Education Fund, Blockchain Association, Solana Policy Institute, and Crypto Council for Innovation. Emmer originally introduced this bill in 2018, and the current version represents continued efforts to establish regulatory clarity. Texas Bitcoin Reserve Bill Passes In related news, the Texas strategic Bitcoin reserve bill ( SB 21 ) has passed the third reading by a vote of 101 to 42 and now heads to the Governor’s desk for signature. The bill establishes the reserve as an investment vehicle, allowing the state to actively buy, sell, and manage high market cap crypto assets for financial security and economic resilience.

According to a report from My London, Jacob Irwin-Cline went out to a London bar and had several drinks before calling an Uber to take him home. Cline said that he did not thoroughly check the details of the Uber ride on his phone and left with a random private cab driver resembling the Uber driver at first glance, but driving a different vehicle — a detail Cline would only discover after the incident. Once inside the vehicle, the US tourist said the driver offered him a cigarette, which Cline said was likely laced with a rare and potent sedative drug called scopolamine. Cline added that the cigarette made him feel extremely docile and tired, causing him to pass out for around 30 minutes before regaining consciousness. Shortly after Cline woke up, the driver ordered him out of the vehicle. As Cline exited, the driver suddenly sped off, striking him with the car and fleeing with his cellphone, which contained his private keys and access to his crypto accounts. The unfortunate incident comes amid a recent spate of kidnappings , extortion incidents, armed robberies, and ransom attempts directed at crypto industry executives, investors, and their families. Related: Chainalysis CEO offers a clue into recent spate of Paris crypto attacks Crypto community members become the targets of violent crime Several kidnapping incidents involving crypto investors, industry executives, and their families have occurred in May. On May 3, the father of an unnamed crypto exchange owner was freed by French police after law enforcement officials raided the property where the individual was being held captive by organized criminals demanding a ransom for his release. Shortly after that incident, the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, the CEO of the Paymium crypto exchange, were the targets of an attempted kidnapping in Paris. The incident occurred in broad daylight when the assailants attacked the family and attempted to force them into a parked vehicle. However, Noizat's daughter and another individual were able to fight off the masked attackers. The rise in violent attacks against crypto investors and professionals has prompted an increase in personal security , including requests for bodyguards and private security measures for those likely to be victimized.

The daily close above the highs is a big deal for the crypto markets. BTC is now in a rising channel since April, with higher highs and higher lows. Technically the breakout is strong. MACD has just given a bullish crossover and the 50 day EMA ($96,956) is rising, the long term trend is strong. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview If BTC holds above $113,369, we may see the next resistance levels at $117,141 and $120,913. But price is at the top of the channel so a pullback to $108,000 could be a healthy reset and a second chance long. Regulation Boosts Investor Confidence Beyond the charts, Bitcoin’s breakout is being driven by big regulatory tailwinds. In Texas, the state lawmakers approved Senate Bill 21 , allowing the state to create a Bitcoin reserve. Once signed into law, Texas will be the second US state after New Hampshire to hold crypto on its balance sheet, a big step in legitimizing Bitcoin as a treasury asset.

This tighter framework will attract institutional capital and solidify Bitcoin as a regulated and strategic hedge in global finance. These policy changes reduce uncertainty and mean crypto is becoming part of the mainstream financial infrastructure – key for long term adoption and capital inflow. Macro Tailwinds Fuel Bullish Outlook for Bitcoin Bitcoin’s rally comes as traditional markets are getting nervous. A disappointing US Treasury auction pushed 20 year bond yields above 5.1%, 10 year and 30 year yields are also spiking. This bond market chaos is driving investors to Bitcoin as a macro hedge.

What sets BTCBULL apart is its unique rewards model — token holders receive Bitcoin airdrops directly tied to BTC’s price rallies. The higher Bitcoin climbs, the more BTC gets distributed — with presale buyers receiving priority rewards over post-launch DEX investors. Key Stats: USDT Raised: $6,172,195.39 / $7,136,435 Token Price: $0.002525 Staking Pool: 1.47B BTCBULL Yield: ~71% APY Built-in scarcity adds even more firepower: every time Bitcoin rises by $50K, BTC Bull triggers a token burn, reducing supply and increasing upside potential for long-term holders. Meanwhile, staking is turning heads. BTCBULL offers a whopping ~71% APY on its Ethereum-based staking pool (currently holding 1.47B BTCBULL), with no lockups or withdrawal fees. That means passive yield — with full liquidity.

2025-05-22T21:30:33.000Z,"Dogecoin Breaks Out Of Bull Pennant—What’s The Target?","An analyst has pointed out how Dogecoin is showing a break out of a Bull Pennant. Here’s where the target could lie, based on the pattern. Dogecoin Has Just Seen A Surge Beyond Bull Pennant Resistance In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a pattern that has been forming in the hourly price of Dogecoin recently. The pattern in question is a “Bull Pennant,” which is a type of Pennant from technical analysis (TA). A Pennant forms whenever the price of an asset witnesses consolidation between two converging trendlines following a sharp move. The initial rapid move is known as the ‘pole,’ and the consolidation channel as the ‘pennant.’ Related Reading: Bitcoin Sets New ATH, But This Metric Says No Overheating Yet This arrangement is similar to that seen in Flag patterns, with the main difference between the two being the fact that Flags involve parallel consolidation channels, not triangular ones. Just like other consolidation patterns in TA, when the price is stuck inside the pennant portion, it is likely to face resistance at the upper level and support at the lower one. Pennants are usually considered continuation patterns, so a breakout is more probable to occur in the same direction as the preceding move (that is, the same orientation as the pole). When the pole is pointing in the up direction, the resulting Pennant is called a Bull Pennant. Similarly, it being in the opposite direction forms what’s known as a Bear Pennant. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the Bull Pennant that the 1-hour Dogecoin price has potentially been trading inside recently: As is visible in the above graph, Dogecoin was witnessing net consolidation toward the downside inside this Bull Pennant earlier, but now, with the latest rally in the asset, its price has managed to find a break above the resistance line. So far, the memecoin hasn’t gained too much distance over the line, so it’s unconfirmed whether this is a real breakout. In the scenario that it is indeed the case and the governing pattern here is a Bull Pennant, then it’s possible that DOGE could end up seeing a rally of a similar scale as the pole of the pattern. The length of the pole involved in this Bull Pennant puts the breakout target at around $0.31. If the memecoin can manage a run to this mark, then its price would have gone up by almost 30% from the current level. Related Reading: $3.8 Billion In Capital Inflows Behind Ethereum’s Post-Pectra Surge, Data Shows It now remains to be seen how Dogecoin would develop in the coming days and whether its path would look anything like the one traced by the pattern.

2025-05-22T21:20:01.000Z,"SecureTech Unveils Ambitious Bitcoin Treasury Strategy and Web3 M&A Push","BitcoinWorld SecureTech Unveils Ambitious Bitcoin Treasury Strategy and Web3 M&A Push In the rapidly evolving intersection of cybersecurity, Web3, and corporate finance, SecureTech is making significant waves. The company has laid out an ambitious roadmap for 2025, signaling a clear intent to strengthen its market position and embrace innovative financial strategies. At the heart of these plans are a strategic share reduction, targeted mergers and acquisitions (M&A) to bolster technology offerings, preparations for a potential stock uplisting to a national exchange, and critically, the development of a pioneering Bitcoin treasury strategy . Understanding SecureTech’s Bold 2025 Vision SecureTech, known for its work in cybersecurity and the burgeoning Web3 space, isn’t just planning incremental changes; they’re outlining a transformative year. The 2025 strategy appears designed to enhance shareholder value, expand technological capabilities, increase market visibility, and integrate digital assets into core corporate finance. Key pillars of their announced plans include: A substantial 55% reduction in outstanding shares. Active pursuit of Web3 M&A opportunities. Steps towards potentially uplisting to a national stock exchange. Implementing a dedicated Bitcoin treasury strategy via subsidiaries and partnerships. Ongoing evaluation of opportunities within the broader blockchain fintech landscape. This multi-faceted approach suggests a company positioning itself for significant growth and adaptation in a dynamic digital economy. Why a 55% Share Reduction? A significant share reduction, like the 55% planned by SecureTech, is a powerful corporate finance move. It typically involves buying back shares from the open market or through tender offers. The primary goal is often to increase the value of the remaining outstanding shares. Here’s how it generally works and potential benefits: Increased Earnings Per Share (EPS): With fewer shares outstanding, the company’s net income is divided among a smaller number of shares, potentially boosting EPS. This can make the stock look more attractive to investors. Improved Valuation Metrics: Other per-share metrics, like book value per share, can also improve. Signaling Confidence: A share buyback can signal that the company believes its stock is undervalued and that investing in its own shares is a good use of capital. Returning Value to Shareholders: It’s a way to return capital to shareholders, similar to dividends, but potentially more tax-efficient in some jurisdictions. Consolidation of Ownership: In some cases, it can consolidate ownership, giving existing shareholders a larger percentage of the company. For SecureTech, this move could be aimed at enhancing its financial profile ahead of potential M&A activities or a stock uplisting, making the company appear financially stronger and more efficient. How Does Web3 M&A Fit In? SecureTech’s focus on Web3 M&A highlights the company’s commitment to expanding its technological footprint in next-generation internet technologies. Web3 encompasses decentralized technologies like blockchain, NFTs, decentralized finance (DeFi), and the metaverse. Mergers and acquisitions in this space can allow SecureTech to: Acquire Talent and Expertise: Bring in skilled teams with specialized knowledge in specific Web3 niches. Gain Access to New Technology: Integrate innovative blockchain protocols, smart contract capabilities, or decentralized application (dApp) platforms. Expand Product Offerings: Add new services or products related to digital asset security, decentralized identity, or Web3 infrastructure. Enter New Markets: Establish a presence in specific Web3 verticals or geographic regions. Accelerate Growth: Achieve faster expansion than would be possible through internal development alone. The strategic nature of this M&A drive suggests SecureTech is looking for synergistic opportunities that complement its existing cybersecurity and Web3 foundations, creating a more robust and diversified technology portfolio. Preparing for a Stock Uplisting: What Does it Mean? Moving from an over-the-counter (OTC) market to a national exchange, such as the Nasdaq or New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), is known as a stock uplisting . This is a significant step for any company and comes with increased scrutiny and requirements. The process typically involves: Meeting stringent financial standards (revenue, net income, market capitalization). Adhering to higher corporate governance requirements. Ensuring a minimum share price and public float. Increased reporting and compliance obligations. The benefits of a successful stock uplisting are substantial: Increased Visibility and Prestige: Listing on a major exchange brings more attention from institutional investors and analysts. Improved Liquidity: Trading volume often increases, making it easier for investors to buy and sell shares. Enhanced Access to Capital: Being on a national exchange can make it easier and cheaper to raise funds through future stock offerings. Broader Investor Base: Attracts a wider range of investors, including large institutions that may have restrictions on investing in OTC stocks. SecureTech’s preparation for this move indicates confidence in its growth trajectory and a desire to access larger capital markets and gain greater legitimacy in the eyes of mainstream finance. Deep Dive: SecureTech’s Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Perhaps one of the most intriguing aspects of SecureTech’s 2025 plan is the development of a dedicated Bitcoin treasury strategy . This involves holding Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset, a practice popularized by companies like MicroStrategy. SecureTech is pursuing this through its subsidiary, Piranha Blockchain, and a partnership with LockerFunder. This structure suggests a multi-pronged approach: Piranha Blockchain’s Role: Likely focuses on the technical and operational aspects of acquiring, securing, and managing the Bitcoin holdings. This could involve developing or utilizing secure custody solutions. LockerFunder Partnership: Could be related to financing mechanisms for acquiring Bitcoin, leveraging existing capital, or potentially providing services related to the strategy’s execution. Strategic Rationale: Companies adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy for various reasons, including a hedge against inflation, a belief in Bitcoin’s long-term appreciation potential, and diversification away from traditional fiat holdings. For a Web3 and fintech-focused company like SecureTech, it also aligns with their core business and expertise in digital assets. Implementing such a strategy involves careful consideration of security, regulatory compliance, accounting treatment, and market volatility. It signals a forward-thinking approach to corporate finance, embracing digital assets as part of a modern treasury management system. Evaluating Further Blockchain Fintech Opportunities Beyond the specific focus on a Bitcoin treasury and Web3 M&A, SecureTech is also broadly evaluating further opportunities in the blockchain fintech space. This indicates a commitment to staying at the forefront of financial technology innovation. What might this evaluation entail? Exploring DeFi Applications: Investigating decentralized finance protocols for potential integration or services. Looking into Tokenization: Examining the potential for tokenizing real-world assets or creating new digital assets. Assessing Payment Solutions: Evaluating blockchain-based payment systems and infrastructure. Identifying Strategic Partnerships: Seeking collaborations with other players in the blockchain and fintech ecosystems. Developing New Products: Creating innovative solutions that leverage blockchain technology for financial use cases, potentially related to security, identity, or asset management. This broad evaluation shows SecureTech’s intent to not only participate in the current digital asset landscape but also to actively shape its future through exploring and potentially integrating emerging blockchain fintech advancements. Benefits and Challenges of SecureTech’s Strategy SecureTech’s comprehensive 2025 plan presents a mix of potential benefits and inherent challenges. Potential Benefits: Enhanced Shareholder Value: Share reduction and potential uplisting can boost stock attractiveness. Technological Leadership: Web3 M&A can integrate cutting-edge tech and talent. Increased Capital Access: Uplisting opens doors to larger funding opportunities. Innovative Finance: Bitcoin treasury strategy aligns with digital asset trends and potential long-term gains. Market Position: Aggressive strategy can solidify SecureTech’s place in the cybersecurity and Web3 sectors. Potential Challenges: Execution Risk: Successfully implementing a share reduction, complex M&A, and an uplisting simultaneously is challenging. Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price volatility introduces risk to the treasury strategy. Regulatory Uncertainty: The Web3 and crypto space faces evolving regulations. Integration Hurdles: Merging acquired companies and technologies can be difficult. Cost and Resources: These initiatives require significant financial and human resources. Navigating these challenges effectively will be key to realizing the full potential of SecureTech’s ambitious plans. What Actionable Insights Can We Take? For investors and market watchers, SecureTech’s strategy offers several points of interest: Monitor Execution: Keep a close eye on how SecureTech progresses with its share reduction, M&A deals, and uplisting efforts. Milestones achieved or missed will be telling. Evaluate Bitcoin Treasury Performance: Track the performance and management of their Bitcoin treasury strategy . This will be a key differentiator and potential value driver, but also a source of risk. Assess M&A Targets: If specific acquisition targets are announced, evaluate how they complement SecureTech’s existing business and contribute to their Web3 M&A goals. Observe Uplisting Progress: Follow their steps towards a national exchange listing, including meeting necessary requirements. Watch for Blockchain Fintech Innovation: Pay attention to any new products or partnerships emerging from their evaluation of blockchain fintech opportunities. SecureTech’s strategy provides a case study in how established tech companies are seeking to integrate digital assets and decentralized technologies into their core operations and financial planning. Conclusion: A Future Built on Digital Assets and Strategic Growth SecureTech’s 2025 strategy paints a picture of a company aggressively pursuing growth and innovation at the frontier of technology and finance. From reducing its share count to preparing for a significant stock uplisting , the company is taking concrete steps to enhance its corporate structure and market standing. Their proactive pursuit of Web3 M&A opportunities signals a clear intent to expand technological capabilities in decentralized domains. However, the most noteworthy element is arguably the formal adoption of a Bitcoin treasury strategy , positioning SecureTech among a growing list of companies integrating digital assets into their balance sheets. Coupled with an ongoing evaluation of broader blockchain fintech possibilities, SecureTech is clearly charting a course deeply intertwined with the future of digital finance and decentralized technology. Success will depend on skillful execution and navigating the inherent volatilities and regulatory complexities of the digital asset space.

2025-05-22T21:10:04.000Z,"Roxom Global Funding: Powering a New Bitcoin Exchange and Crypto Media Empire","BitcoinWorld Roxom Global Funding: Powering a New Bitcoin Exchange and Crypto Media Empire Exciting news is rippling through the cryptocurrency world! Roxom Global, a project with a clear focus on Bitcoin, has successfully closed a significant funding round. This development signals strong investor confidence not just in Roxom Global’s vision, but also in the continued potential of the Bitcoin ecosystem and broader crypto investment landscape. Understanding the Roxom Global Funding Breakdown The recent capital raise by Roxom Global is quite substantial, totaling an impressive $17.9 million. What’s particularly interesting is how this funding is allocated, highlighting the company’s dual-pronged strategy: $7.9 million: Earmarked specifically for the development and launch of their BTC-denominated securities exchange. This is a key piece of their infrastructure, focusing on transactions settled directly in Bitcoin. $10 million: Dedicated to building out RoxomTV, their ambitious 24/7 crypto media network . This indicates a strong belief in the need for dedicated, round-the-clock coverage of the crypto space. This strategic split in the Roxom Global funding underscores the project’s aim to be both a transactional hub and a central information source within the Bitcoin and crypto communities. Why a BTC-Denominated Bitcoin Exchange? The decision to build a Bitcoin exchange where securities are denominated in BTC is a notable one. Most traditional exchanges and even many crypto platforms primarily use fiat currencies (like USD) or stablecoins (like USDT) as the primary trading pair. A BTC-denominated exchange means that the value of assets listed and traded on the platform would be measured directly in Bitcoin. This approach could appeal strongly to Bitcoin maximalists and those who view BTC itself as the primary unit of account and store of value. Potential Benefits: Aligns with Bitcoin Philosophy: Caters directly to users who prefer to operate purely within the Bitcoin standard. Simplifies BTC-Native Strategies: Makes it easier for users to manage and grow their wealth directly in Bitcoin terms. Potential for Innovation: Could pave the way for new types of financial products and services built natively on Bitcoin. Potential Challenges: Niche Market: May initially appeal to a smaller subset of the overall crypto market compared to fiat or stablecoin pairs. Volatility: Trading against a volatile asset like BTC introduces different risk dynamics compared to stable assets. Regulatory Hurdles: Navigating the regulatory landscape for a securities exchange, especially one dealing directly in crypto, can be complex. The Vision for a 24/7 Crypto Media Network With $10 million allocated, RoxomTV aims to be a significant player in the crypto media network space. In a market that never sleeps, having a constant stream of news, analysis, and market data is crucial for investors and enthusiasts alike. A dedicated 24/7 network could offer: Real-time market updates and price analysis. Breaking news coverage from around the globe. In-depth interviews with industry leaders and experts. Educational content for newcomers and advanced traders. Live event coverage and commentary. Building a reputable and widely watched crypto media network requires significant investment in infrastructure, talent, and content creation. Roxom Global’s substantial funding for this arm suggests they are serious about becoming a go-to source for crypto information, aiming to compete with established players and fill potential gaps in round-the-clock coverage. Strategic BTC Treasury Accumulation Beyond building infrastructure, Roxom Global is also focused on strengthening its own balance sheet by accumulating Bitcoin. The report indicates their current BTC treasury holds over $12.5 million worth of Bitcoin at current market prices. Furthermore, they plan to purchase an additional 30 BTC. This strategy of holding Bitcoin on the corporate balance sheet has become increasingly popular among companies, large and small, looking to hedge against inflation or signal their conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value. Holding a significant BTC treasury serves multiple purposes: Store of Value: Positioning Bitcoin as a primary reserve asset. Alignment with Mission: For a Bitcoin-focused company, holding BTC aligns their financial health directly with the asset they promote. Potential Appreciation: Benefiting from potential future increases in Bitcoin’s price. Adding 30 more BTC to a treasury already exceeding $12.5 million demonstrates a strong commitment to this strategy and further ties the company’s future to Bitcoin’s performance. This move is a tangible form of crypto investment by the company itself, distinct from the funding received from external investors. What Does This Funding Round Signal for Crypto Investment? The successful $17.9 million Roxom Global funding round is more than just news about one company; it’s a positive indicator for the broader crypto investment climate. It shows that despite market volatility, investors are still willing to back ambitious projects within the crypto space, particularly those focusing on core infrastructure like exchanges and essential services like media. Key takeaways for those interested in crypto investment : Continued Confidence: Significant capital is still flowing into promising crypto ventures. Focus on Infrastructure: Projects building fundamental layers (exchanges, data/media) are attracting serious investment. Bitcoin Remains Central: Funding for Bitcoin-centric projects like Roxom Global highlights BTC’s enduring importance in the ecosystem. Dual Approach: Combining financial services (exchange) with information services (media) is seen as a potentially powerful model. This funding round suggests that the market is maturing, with investment flowing towards projects that aim to build sustainable, multi-faceted businesses rather than just speculative tokens. Conclusion: Roxom Global’s Ambitious Path Ahead Roxom Global’s successful $17.9 million funding round marks a significant milestone. With substantial capital allocated to both a unique BTC-denominated Bitcoin exchange and an ambitious 24/7 crypto media network , the company is positioning itself to be a key player in the evolving digital asset landscape. Their strategy of accumulating Bitcoin for their BTC treasury further reinforces their commitment to the ecosystem’s foundational asset. As they move forward, the execution of these plans will be crucial, but the initial Roxom Global funding provides a powerful launchpad for their ambitious vision in the world of crypto investment and beyond.

Analyst Explains Why","Bitcoin hits all-time high, surpassing $111,000 Evaluating the dynamics behind this historic rise, Bitwise Asset Management's Investment Director Matt Hougan stated that the rally has just begun and is a harbinger of a long-term rise. According to Hougan, Bitcoin's rise is driven by two key factors: the increasing interest of institutional investors in the market and indirect support from the US government. “More than $8 billion has flowed into Bitcoin ETFs in the last 30 days. This means new demand against fixed supply and pushes prices up,” Hougan said, adding that the government’s increasing budget deficits and money printing policies have also pushed investors away from fiat currencies, which has increased their focus on Bitcoin. Related News: Following Record Highs in Bitcoin, US Crypto Chief David Sacks Makes Critical Statements Hougan said the rise in long-term government bonds and developments in markets such as Japan suggested investors were losing appetite for borrowing. “The U.S. government is no longer serious about budget cuts. That calls into question the long-term value of the dollar,” he said. Hougan also touched on why this strong performance of Bitcoin was not seen in altcoins, saying that Bitcoin is in a different position as “digital gold.” He said, “Cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Solana should be evaluated more like technology investments,” and stated that it is natural for these assets to perform differently than Bitcoin. Hougan predicts that Bitcoin will reach new records in the coming period. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Why Did Bitcoin (BTC) Hit a New Record High? Why Are Altcoins Quiet?

The S&P 500 dipped 0.04%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.28%. The legislation—projected by the Congressional Budget Office to add nearly $4 trillion to the federal deficit—includes sweeping tax cuts and increased military spending. It passed the House by a single vote after last-minute revisions, including expanded deductions for state and local taxes, aimed at swaying conservative lawmakers. The bill now heads to the Senate. Another spike in Treasury yields tempered investor sentiment. The 30-year bond briefly rose above 5.16%—its highest level since 2023—before easing. The benchmark 10-year yield also pulled back slightly to 4.55%. Analysts said weak demand at Wednesday’s 20-year bond auction fueled the earlier sell-off in Treasurys, while concerns about debt sustainability persist. “Short term, the tax bill is good for the economy,” said Argent Capital’s Jed Ellerbroek. “But in the longer term, it adds to the deficit, and that’s bad for markets.” You might also like: CFTC’s Mersinger says crypto perpetual futures could trade in U.S. Bitcoin keeps hitting all-time highs Bitcoin ( BTC ) extended its massive rally, trading above $111,000, amid optimism over Senate progress on stablecoin regulation and anticipation surrounding a Trump donor event attended by major crypto holders. Bitcoin’s rally sparked limited excitement among derivatives traders compared to past bull runs. Analysts noted that spot market demand, not speculation, drove the gains, with long/short ratios and liquidations indicating moderate bullish sentiment.

Speaking on the program, Scaramucci stated that Bitcoin has risen to $ 111,000, and attributed this rise to both investor interest and bipartisan regulatory efforts regarding stablecoins in the US. “Stablecoin laws will help Bitcoin and crypto assets in general to be placed on a more institutional and legal basis,” Scaramucci said, adding that initiatives such as the “Stable Act” and “Genius Act” are particularly noteworthy. According to Scaramucci, stablecoins can be a tool that will support not only the crypto ecosystem but also the global strength of the US dollar. In his statement on this subject, he used the following expressions: “Stablecoins will reduce global transaction costs and greatly benefit those without access to the banking system. In addition, the reserves of these coins are mostly US Treasury bonds. This could strengthen the dollar’s position as a global reserve currency.” Related News: Following Record Highs in Bitcoin, US Crypto Chief David Sacks Makes Critical Statements Scaramucci highlighted that major stablecoin issuers like Tether have a larger holding in US Treasury bonds than countries like Germany or Japan. Anthony Scaramucci also touched on President Donald Trump’s stance on crypto assets. Stating that he finds some of Trump’s deregulation steps positive, Scaramucci also said that “memecoin”-based campaign messages or controversial approaches regarding wallet control create a negative perception in the sector. Scaramucci stated that due to increasing public spending and central bank monetary policies, many investors tend to turn to alternative assets other than the US dollar. Stating that Bitcoin stands out as an attractive store of value due to its limited supply, the investor said, “The unconscious spending of central banks for a long time is now directing investors to more reliable havens.” Scaramucci singled out Circle among the companies he invested in in the stablecoin sector. Describing the company’s founder Jeremy Allaire and his team as “very successful in terms of regulatory compliance,” Scaramucci stated that he has confidence in Circle as one of the leaders in the stablecoin sector. *This is not investment advice.

Mersinger announced that he will be moving to a new role at the Blockchain Association in order to continue to play an active role in regulating the crypto industry. Speaking about the stablecoin regulation expected to pass the Senate, Mersinger said, “The passage of this bill shows that this asset class is now permanent and that the US aims to lead in this area.” He argued that the US could further consolidate its economic power with these new technologies. Mersinger stated that it was a challenging process to make the decision to leave before completing his term, which will last until 2028. However, he expressed that he believes that he can make a more effective contribution to priority issues such as stablecoin law and market structure regulations through his new role at the Blockchain Association. Related News: Altcoin Developers Make a Statement Regarding Today's $224 Million Hack Incident Mersinger argued that the CFTC is in a unique position as a regulator of the crypto spot market. “We already have oversight authority in the futures markets. As the CFTC, we are a market regulator, and that makes us competent,” he said. He also said that the CFTC is a global regulator, so it can effectively oversee international crypto markets as well. CFTC Member Mersinger: “Cryptocurrency Futures Products to Begin Trading Soon” Mersinger, who said that cryptocurrency perpetual futures products may soon start trading in the US, stated that some applications are in the evaluation phase and that these products will soon start trading within the framework of US regulations. “It would be a great gain for the sector if these products return to the US market,” he said. Mersinger, who noted that the CFTC has historically relied on bipartisan cooperation, argued that the agency operates independently of political pressures and that the agency can effectively monitor markets even with a small number of members. While US President Donald Trump’s wealth growth from crypto investments during his re-election campaign has been a source of public debate, Mersinger said these discussions are distracting from the real issues. “What we really need to focus on is having markets operate in a regulated manner in the US.

2025-05-22T20:00:31.000Z,"Bitcoin Rally ‘Remains Robust’ as One BTC Metric Reaches Historic All-Time Highs, According to Glassnode","The latest rally sending Bitcoin ( BTC ) to new all-time highs is showing a lot of strength as one key metric reaches unprecedented levels, according to the digital asset analytics firm Glassnode. Glassnode says that Bitcoin’s Realized Cap, which records the price at which each coin was last moved and aims to gauge how many holders are in profit or at a loss, is hitting a new all-time high. “Strength in the digital asset market remains robust with Bitcoin continuing to consolidate just beneath its all-time high of $109,000. The elevation in price has raised the profitability of the vast majority of market investors, with many seizing the opportunity to lock in profits. As a result, capital inflows have increased markedly, pushing the Realized Cap above $900 billion for the first time, a historic milestone that underscores the depth of liquidity in the market.” Glassnode also says that Short-Term Holders (STHs), those entities that have held their coins for less than 155 days, have sold at massive profits in the last month, while Bitcoin is absorbing the selling pressure. “For the Short-Term Holders, the improvement in their portfolio values has directly translated into a notable increase in spending activity, with the cohort realizing over $11.4 billion of profit across the last month.” Glassnode reports on the social media platform X that ever since Bitcoin plummeted to a local low of around $74,000 in early April, the market value to realized value (MVRV) metric – which gauges the market’s sentiment and valuation of a crypto asset – has soared for both STHs and Long-Term Holders (LTHs). A rising MVRV means “holders are sitting on more unrealized profit – boosting confidence and reducing sell pressure,” according to the analytics firm. “Since the $74,000 low: MVRV: 1.74 to 2.33 (+74% to +133%). STH MVRV: 0.82 to 1.13 (from -18% loss to +13% gain). LTH MVRV: 2.91 to 3.30 (+191% to +230%). Profitability is up across the board, boosting confidence and supporting the rally.” Bitcoin printed a new all-time high Wednesday, briefly breaking past $110,000 for the first time in its history. The top crypto asset has since retraced, trading for $109,686 at time of writing, up 2.6% in the last 24 hours.

2025-05-22T20:00:12.000Z,"Ethereum Consolidates Above $2,500 While BTC Leads the Charge – Key Levels To Watch","Ethereum is gaining momentum as optimism returns to the crypto market. With Bitcoin officially entering price discovery and surging past its all-time highs, attention is turning toward ETH, which is now testing critical resistance levels. Ethereum has gained over 55% since early May, riding the wave of broader market strength and renewed investor confidence. However, despite the impressive recovery, ETH still lags behind Bitcoin’s pace and has yet to reclaim its 2021 highs. Related Reading: Litecoin Eyes $117.50 As Price Rebounds From Key Support – Analyst Top analyst Daan shared a technical view highlighting that Ethereum has been chopping around the $2,400–$2,600 zone since its explosive move earlier this month. This range-bound price action signals indecision, as buyers remain active but haven’t yet triggered a breakout. Daan notes that although Bitcoin is showing strong leadership with its push into new highs, Ethereum’s performance in this phase has been more muted. Still, the setup remains constructive for bulls. The $2,400 level has acted as solid support, while resistance above $2,800 remains the next target to clear for continuation. As Bitcoin continues to lead, ETH could be next in line to surge—if it can escape this range and follow BTC’s lead into a new leg higher. All eyes are now on Ethereum’s next move. Ethereum Prepares For A Breakout As Altcoins Enter The Spotlight As Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high above $111K, the broader crypto market appears to be entering a fresh phase of momentum, one that could drive massive gains across altcoins. Among them, Ethereum remains in a critical position. While ETH hasn’t followed BTC’s breakout just yet, it’s holding firmly above support and showing signs of building strength. To confirm a bullish continuation, ETH needs to break decisively above resistance and lead the altcoin rally. Daan shared a technical view highlighting that ETH has been consolidating between the $2,400 and $2,600 levels since its last squeeze higher. Despite Bitcoin’s explosive move, Ethereum is once again lagging, a dynamic that’s been reflected in a cooling ETH/BTC ratio. This underperformance has sparked debate among traders, with many waiting for ETH to catch up and drive the next altseason. Daan emphasized that the $2,500 zone has been well-defended by bulls, but ETH has yet to produce a convincing breakout. The key resistance level to watch is $2,850—clearing it would mark a technical shift toward higher highs. On the flip side, if ETH falls below $2,100, it could trigger a broader pullback. For now, ETH remains range-bound but poised, with market sentiment growing more optimistic by the day.

After weeks of consolidation in the $2,400–$2,600 range, ETH has pushed toward the upper boundary of this zone, hinting at a possible breakout. The recent bounce from support around $2,450 has been strong, with consecutive green candles and rising volume signaling increasing bullish momentum. The 200-period SMA and EMA, currently at $2,077 and $2,1,99 respectively, are well below the current price, confirming a bullish market structure. ETH has held above both moving averages since early May, and the current price action appears to be building up pressure for a decisive move. Related Reading: Dogecoin Momentum Fades – Analyst Expects $0.213 Retest However, ETH must now break above $2,700 convincingly to confirm a breakout and signal a continuation toward higher resistance at $2,850 and beyond.

A breakout could trigger a rapid move to $3,000, while failure to hold current levels could drag ETH back toward its previous support.

Bitcoin’s breakout failed to usher euphoria among traders and the reaction on derivatives traders was muted, relative to previous BTC price rallies. Ethereum ( ETH ) struggles to attract institutional inflows even as ETH rallies alongside Bitcoin ( BTC ) in its price discovery. Altcoins in the top 50 cryptocurrencies ranked by market capitalization are in the green, rallying in the last 24 hours. Table of Contents Bitcoin derivatives analysis Ethereum technical and derivatives analysis Crypto trader sentiment and why euphoria is missing How high can Bitcoin go? Expert commentary Bitcoin derivatives analysis Analysts at 10xResearch and Amberdata are in agreement on the fact that spot market strength and not speculation, is driving gains in BTC. Bitcoin’s rally beyond $111,000 failed to kick in a euphoria among traders and the long/short ratio across top derivatives exchanges is above 1. While this indicates that traders are bullish on BTC and expect further gains, on previous instances like the 2017 and 2020 cycles, the ratio exceeded 2. The 24-hour liquidation data shows $175 million in shorts liquidations and over $47 million in long positions were liquidated. Bearish traders are being punished for betting against Bitcoin price rally, but the key question is, how high will Bitcoin go?

Crypto trader sentiment and why euphoria is missing The Fear and Greed Index Chart on CoinMarketCap shows that even as Bitcoin enters price discovery, the levels of “Greed” observed in November 2024 were the highest. Trader sentiment is not as euphoric as one might expect, at the time of writing it reads 73. Extreme greed is typically correlated with cycle peaks or yearly tops. Above $110,000 Bitcoin is still lagging in terms of bullish sentiment among traders. This may be a positive sign as it supports the thesis that the cycle top is still away and traders are likely waiting and watching for the next pullback and rally in BTC. Fear and Greed Index chart | Source: CMC How high can Bitcoin go? Bitcoin’s target is the $122,000 level that coincides with the 127.2% Fibonacci retracement of its 50% rally from April 7 low to May 22 peak. BTC is currently less than 10% away from its target and technical indicators on the daily price chart support likelihood of further gains. RSI is sloping upwards and crossed into the “overvalued” zone and MACD flashes consecutive green histogram bars. If Bitcoin tests resistance at $122,000 and breaks past this level, the next target at $127,352 comes into play. The $127,352 target is the 141.4% Fibonacci retracement level for Bitcoin in its ongoing upward trend. While analysts at Bernstein pushed their target for Bitcoin to $200,000 in 2025, it is likely that BTC crosses the $127,000 level before June 2025, based on its gains since April 2025.

Exchanges like Binance and Bybit have seen “heavy open interest entries that trap shorts and attract fresh longs,” in this zone. Bitcoin pushed above resistance between the $105,000 and $106,000 level early on Thursday. It remains to be seen how long Bitcoin holds above the FVGs on the daily timeframe. Bitfinex analysts told Crypto.news in a written note that the team is watching minor liquidity walls between $114,000 and $118,000 and the $123,000 to $125,000 zone is where large options open interest is building.

In a new strategy session, crypto trader Kevin Svenson tells his 83,200 YouTube subscribers that the top crypto asset by market cap’s latest upward shift confirms that it’s going to continue climbing until the end of this week, bringing BTC’s price to at least $115,000. “This run could be finishing around the end of May 23rd or May 24th, that may be when we actually get to $115,000, so really just a three-day run just like [previously]. I mean I don’t see a reason why this can’t happen. Usually, when you break the all-time high, there’s a lot of momentum, there’s a lot of excitement, and prices move very quickly. So seeing Bitcoin at 115,000 around May 23rd or May 24th would be no surprise at all now.” However, Svenson cautions traders not to take his prediction as meaning that the flagship digital asset is guaranteed to lose steam at $115,000, as he says it could shoot up to $124,000 by July. “Even though I’m saying that we might stall at $115,000, that does not mean that the run would be over at $115,000. We might just get some chop consolidation and then ultimately run up towards my parabolic trend target of $124,000 – that’s where I think we might actually be by the time that July rolls around.” Bitcoin is trading for $111,322 at time of writing, a 2.1% increase during the last 24 hours.

Here are the prominent transactions of the day: On April 27, a mystery whale purchased 30,000 Ethereum (ETH) via over-the-counter transactions for a total of $54.9 million at $1,830. The same whale also purchased 600 Bitcoin (BTC), paying $56.94 million for the transaction.

2025-05-22T19:40:13.000Z,"Altcoin Season: Explosive Opportunity Predicted After Bitcoin Halving","BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season: Explosive Opportunity Predicted After Bitcoin Halving The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with anticipation. Could we be on the verge of the most significant surge in altcoin prices we’ve ever seen? That’s the exciting possibility being discussed following a notable altcoin prediction from analyst Wimar.X. According to reports from BeInCrypto, Wimar.X suggests that the conditions are aligning for an altcoin season of unprecedented scale, potentially kicking off as early as May 25. Why is May 25 a Potential Trigger for Altcoin Season? This specific date isn’t pulled out of thin air. Wimar.X’s analysis is rooted in historical patterns observed in the crypto market , particularly those following Bitcoin halving events. The halving, a programmed reduction in the rate at which new Bitcoin is created, has historically acted as a catalyst for significant market movements. While Bitcoin often sees a rally leading up to or shortly after the halving, the subsequent phase frequently involves capital rotating from Bitcoin into altcoins, fueling their growth. The theory is that after Bitcoin’s price has seen substantial appreciation, investors look for opportunities elsewhere in the market where potential percentage gains might be higher. This search for value often leads them to altcoins – cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. Here’s a simplified look at the typical post-halving market cycle phases: Phase 1: Pre-Halving Rally: Bitcoin’s price tends to rise as anticipation builds. Phase 2: Post-Halving Consolidation/Initial Dip: Sometimes a ‘sell the news’ event or a period of sideways movement occurs. Phase 3: Bitcoin Parabolic Run: Bitcoin experiences a major price surge, often reaching new all-time highs. Phase 4: Altcoin Season: Capital flows from Bitcoin into altcoins, causing many to outperform BTC significantly. Phase 5: Market Peak & Correction: The overall market peaks, followed by a significant downturn. Wimar.X’s prediction suggests we are nearing the transition from Phase 3 or an early stage of Phase 4, where the environment becomes ripe for altcoins to shine. Understanding the Role of BTC Dominance in Altcoin Season A key indicator supporting the potential for an altcoin season is BTC dominance . What is it? BTC dominance refers to Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies. It’s expressed as a percentage. BTC Dominance = (Bitcoin Market Cap / Total Crypto Market Cap) * 100% When BTC dominance is high, it means a large portion of the total value in the crypto market is held in Bitcoin. This often happens during bear markets (when investors flock to the perceived safety of BTC) or during strong Bitcoin-led rallies. Conversely, when BTC dominance falls, it indicates that altcoins are gaining market share relative to Bitcoin. This is the hallmark of an altcoin season . As capital rotates from BTC into various altcoins, Bitcoin’s percentage of the total market cap decreases, even if Bitcoin’s price isn’t necessarily falling (it might just be growing slower than altcoins, or staying stable while altcoins rise). Wimar.X specifically points out that BTC dominance has recently seen a new all-time high relative to the current market structure and is now showing signs of falling. This decline after a peak is historically a strong precursor to significant altcoin rallies. It signals that investors are beginning to diversify away from their primary Bitcoin holdings into the broader altcoin landscape. What Does a Potential Explosive Altcoin Season Mean for You? If Wimar.X’s altcoin prediction holds true, an explosive altcoin season presents significant opportunities for investors. Historically, during these periods, many altcoins have seen gains far exceeding those of Bitcoin, with some experiencing parabolic price increases. Potential Benefits: Higher Percentage Gains: Altcoins, especially those with smaller market caps, have the potential for exponential growth during a season. Portfolio Diversification: Investing in a range of altcoins across different sectors (DeFi, NFTs, Layer 2s, etc.) can diversify your crypto holdings beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. Early Adoption Potential: Identifying promising altcoins early in their growth cycle can lead to substantial long-term returns. Potential Challenges & Risks: Increased Volatility: Altcoins are generally more volatile than Bitcoin. Prices can rise and fall dramatically in short periods. Risk of Failure: Many altcoin projects do not succeed. Identifying legitimate projects amidst hype is crucial and difficult. Liquidity Issues: Some smaller altcoins may have low trading volume, making it difficult to buy or sell large positions without impacting the price. Scams and Rug Pulls: The altcoin space is unfortunately rife with fraudulent projects designed to steal investor funds. Current Market Signals and Historical Context While the Altcoin Season Index (an index tracking whether 75% of the top 50 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days) currently remains low, this isn’t necessarily contradictory to the prediction. A low index simply reflects the recent past performance, which has been dominated by Bitcoin’s strength. The prediction is forward-looking, based on the expectation of a shift. Furthermore, historical data shows that the second quarter (Q2) of the year has often been a strong period for the crypto market , including altcoins. Combining this historical Q2 strength with the post- Bitcoin halving cycle dynamics and the observed fall in BTC dominance creates a compelling argument for the potential timing of the predicted altcoin season . Actionable Insights: Preparing for a Potential Altcoin Surge If you believe an explosive altcoin season is on the horizon, how can you position yourself? Here are some actionable steps: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): This is paramount. Don’t invest based solely on hype. Research projects’ fundamentals, technology, team, tokenomics, and community. Identify Promising Sectors: Look into areas of the crypto market showing innovation and growth potential (e.g., specific Layer 2 solutions, DePIN projects, AI-related tokens, specific DeFi protocols). Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across multiple promising altcoins and sectors. Consider Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Set stop-loss orders to limit potential downside. Have an exit strategy – know when you plan to take profits. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of investing a lump sum, consider investing a fixed amount at regular intervals to average out your purchase price. Monitor Key Indicators: Keep an eye on BTC dominance , the Altcoin Season Index, overall market sentiment, and news developments. Secure Your Assets: Use reputable exchanges and consider hardware wallets for storing your cryptocurrencies, especially if you accumulate a significant amount. Remember, this is an altcoin prediction based on historical trends and current indicators. The crypto market is inherently unpredictable, and there are no guarantees. Concluding Thoughts: Navigating the Potential Altcoin Wave The prospect of the largest altcoin season in history beginning around May 25 is undoubtedly exciting for anyone involved in the crypto market . The confluence of the post- Bitcoin halving cycle, the observed decline in BTC dominance , and historical Q2 strength provides a compelling narrative for this potential surge. While the analyst Wimar.X’s altcoin prediction offers a specific timeframe, the underlying market dynamics suggest that conditions are becoming favorable for altcoins to potentially outperform Bitcoin. However, with great potential comes great risk. An explosive altcoin season is also a period of heightened volatility and increased exposure to less established assets. Approaching this period with a well-researched strategy, a diversified portfolio, and robust risk management is essential. Whether the exact date is May 25 or slightly later, the signs are pointing towards a potentially significant shift in market dynamics that could favor altcoins in the coming months.

2025-05-22T19:40:02.000Z,"Democrats propose crypto ban for politicians, protest outside Trump’s memecoin gala","Just hours before President Donald Trump’s high-profile gala for holders of his memecoin, Democratic lawmakers moved to curb what they call rising “crypto corruption” in Washington. Led by Rep. Maxine Waters, 15 House Democrats introduced the “Stop Trading, Retention, and Unfair Market Payoffs in Crypto Act of 2025.” The bill would prohibit the president, vice president, members of Congress, and their immediate families from owning, promoting, or profiting from digital assets while in office. Lawmakers would also be barred from holding crypto assets in ways that allow them to exert unilateral control over the tokens. “Trump’s crypto con is not just a scam to target investors,” Waters said in a statement. “It’s also a dangerous backdoor for selling influence over American policies to the highest foreign bidder.” The legislation arrives amid a wave of criticism surrounding Trump’s deepening ties to crypto. The president and his wife, Melania, recently launched personal memecoins. Trump’s family has also backed a stablecoin through the crypto firm World Liberty Financial, and his sons are linked to a Bitcoin mining venture. Blockchain records indicate that Justin Sun, founder of Tron and a Chinese national, is one of the largest holders of TRUMP ( TRUMP ) — the memecoin that serves as a ticket to Thursday night’s dinner.

Critics, including Sen. Richard Blumenthal, accuse Trump of “auctioning” access to the White House and potentially violating the Constitution’s ban on foreign gifts. Protests are happening outside the event. Senators Chris Murphy, Elizabeth Warren, and Jeff Merkley, along with Rep. Sam Liccardo and advocacy groups, are calling out Donald Trump’s upcoming “meme coin” fundraising dinner as a threat to national security and a potential corruption risk, according to a note shared with crypto.news. At a press conference today, the group demanded the release of attendee names and any promised favors. Murphy also promoted his recently introduced MEME Act, aimed at curbing digital asset profiteering by public officials.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) rally to its all-time high of $111,970 was likely fueled by leverage. On Thursday, May 22, open interest on Bitcoin futures across crypto exchanges reached $80.91 billion , the highest level ever recorded. Exchange BTC futures open interest | Source: CoinGlass On Binance, the largest exchange by volume of derivative contracts, open interest climbed to $13.60 billion.

Institutions and retail are driving Bitcoin’s growth Adding to this narrative is the fact has not seen a significant spike in search interest for Bitcoin. Google Trends reveals a significant decline in search interest for the keyword Bitcoin since November. Specifically, Bitcoin search volume score was at 22, compared to 100 in May 2021, when BTC lost 50% of its value in a matter of weeks. Even during the November rally, Bitcoin’s search volume score peaked at just 64. This suggests that despite Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. elections, retail investors are not as engaged as they were during the 2021 crash. The most likely explanation is that institutional investors are increasingly betting on Bitcoin. Notably, Trump’s election win and subsequent pro-crypto stance have helped legitimize Bitcoin among institutional players—credibility it previously lacked. Read more: Missed the $10k to $100k ride?

Psy (formerly QED Protocol) has developed a trustless bridge connecting Dogecoin to the Solana blockchain. This innovation brings proof-of-work security to Solana while making Dogecoin, the world’s largest memecoin, available to Solana’s ecosystem of dapps. This innovation allows Solana and Dogecoin to directly ‘speak’ to each other, with each blockchain able to independently verify the other’s transactions and consensus without requiring trust in third parties. The bridge not only enhances security but also creates substantial ecosystem opportunities. Bringing Dogecoin’s $36B+ market cap and massive community to Solana opens new possibilities for both networks. Dogecoin users gain access to Solana’s DeFi, NFT, and gaming applications, while Solana developers can tap into Dogecoin’s extensive user base. Unlike traditional bridges, which often rely on multisig signers or custodians, Psy’s next-generation proof-of-work technology validates Dogecoin Proof of Work consensus directly on Solana. This trust-minimized approach helps address a major weakness in crypto infrastructure: bridge hacks, which have caused more than $2.8 billion in losses to date. This positions Psy as the leading proof-of-work innovator for Solana, bridging the security benefits of proof-of-work with Solana’s speed and programmability. This integration demonstrates that new proof-of-work chains, like Psy’s, can interact with high-performance blockchains without sacrificing security or requiring centralized intermediaries. This bridge continues Psy Protocol’s mission to empower developers to build hyper-scalable web3 applications to host the next generation of the decentralized internet. The bridge supports standard Dogecoin wallets and exchange deposits. Quotes “We have been working hard to find ways to better serve the Doge community, and now we get the chance to offer them even greater utility for their Dogecoin,” Carter Feldman, CEO of Psy Protocol, said. “This demonstrates the promise of combining best-in-class security with user demand and an established developer base.” “We’re thrilled to announce the DOGE bridge to Solana, a big step in welcoming one of crypto’s most iconic communities to the Solana ecosystem,” said Lily Liu, President of the Solana Foundation. “DOGE, Bitcoin’s beloved pet, embodies the fun, irreverent spirit that drives on-chain culture. By bridging DOGE into Solana’s network, we’re inviting the Dogecoin community—and all OG crypto enthusiasts—to join us in marrying on-chain culture and decentralized finance.” “Trustless verification has always been the holy grail of interoperability, but achieving it at scale has remained elusive,” said Robinson Burkey, co-founder of Wormhole. “Seeing Psy and Wormhole come together to build this around an asset like DOGE captures the true cyberpunk spirit of crypto. We’re excited to help bring a $36B asset to Solana—soon to be powered by Wormhole.” How the Bridge Works The bridge captures and verifies each Dogecoin block header on Solana. Block headers contain essential blockchain data, including the previous block hash, timestamp, difficulty target, the Merkle root of all transactions in the block, and the Proof of Work consensus algorithm. By verifying these headers directly on Solana, the system cryptographically confirms the validity of Dogecoin transactions without intermediaries. When users send DOGE to the bridge, the system verifies the deposit on the Dogecoin blockchain and mints an equivalent amount of QDOGE tokens on Solana. To convert back, QDOGE tokens are burned on Solana, with withdrawal messages securely transmitted through Wormhole’s cross-chain messaging protocol, triggering the release of the original DOGE to the user’s Dogecoin address.

2025-05-22T19:16:33.000Z,"BlockTrust IRA Brings Quant Trading Tools to Crypto Retirement Accounts","As spot bitcoin BTC exchange-traded funds continue to grow and Wall Street wades deeper into crypto, more and more people are able to gain exposure to digital assets through their individual retirement accounts (IRAs). IRAs offer tax advantages and a range of investment options, including stocks, real estate, commodities and, increasingly, cryptocurrencies. But when it comes to crypto, there’s usually only one investment strategy available: to buy and hold. It’s a strategy that might work well for assets like the S&P 500, which have long track records of steadily appreciating over longer time frames, but bitcoin is still an extremely volatile asset and other coins even more so. The idea behind BlockTrust IRA, then, is simple: to manage the crypto positions of its customers in order to take advantage of that volatility and maximize their returns. “We're the only company that has an AI tool meshed with traders that put people automatically in cash [when need be]. Then we wait for the right signals, and we buy back in,” Jonathan Rose, the firm’s CEO, told CoinDesk in an interview. “Where people are scared of volatility and scared of risk, we actually want the volatility and the risk associated with that, because that's how we actually make our clients money,” Rose said. “We are right a lot more than we are wrong, and that's how we're able to beat the benchmark.” BlockTrust’s secret sauce? Animus Technologies, a fund that provides intelligent asset management solutions for crypto. Animus has servers around the world and quantifies humongous amounts of data — to the point that a European government body has reached out to inquire what exactly they’re quantifying data for, according to Rose. Animus typically only shares its signals with high net-worth individuals and fund clients, Rose said. In other words, crypto retail participants may now benefit, through their BlockTrust accounts, from the kind of trading mechanisms that previously were only available to quant funds. The sophisticated strategies are currently only available for bitcoin BTC and ether ETH, but BlockTrust offers exposure to 60 different cryptocurrencies, Rose said. Users of the platform can invest as little as $1,000 for non-managed accounts, or $25,000 if they want a managed account — and trading fees can go as low as 0.4% for the former and 0.14% for the latter. BlockTrust IRA went live officially in February. In March, the firm had accrued $10 million in assets, and Rose expects it to bring in roughly $100 million before the end of the year. The company’s early success may also be due to the fact that it’s not just open to U.S. residents, but to people all around the world, as long as they can pass its Know-Your-Customer (KYC) checks. Americans do have the added advantage of being able to use their tax-deferred retirement savings to gain exposure. Crypto markets are ever changing, and trading strategies that function perfectly for a long time may suddenly become outdated due to shifts in the economic environment or crypto-intrinsic changes — potentially threatening to render Animus’ approach obsolete someday. But Rose isn’t concerned. “When [the people at] Animus Technologies go to these hedge fund conferences and speak, they always come back with a big grin on their faces, because they're like, ‘We are so light-years ahead of anyone remotely doing what we're doing,’” Rose said. “It's going to take like four to six years for people to even kind of catch up to us.”",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/22/blocktrust-ira-brings-quant-trading-tools-to-crypto-retirement-accounts,"BTC|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Ether|Bitcoin IRA|Exclusive|News",cryptocompare

2025-05-22T19:10:56.000Z,"Binance Lawsuit UK: Court Delivers Massive Blow to $13.3B Bitcoin SV Claim","BitcoinWorld Binance Lawsuit UK: Court Delivers Massive Blow to $13.3B Bitcoin SV Claim Imagine a lawsuit demanding a staggering $13.3 billion! That was the situation facing one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance, stemming from its decision regarding Bitcoin SV (BSV). However, a recent ruling by the UK Court of Appeal has dramatically shifted the landscape, delivering a significant blow to the claimants seeking this massive sum. What Was the Massive Binance Lawsuit UK All About? At its core, this legal battle revolved around the decision by Binance and other exchanges to delist Bitcoin SV (BSV) back in 2019. The claimants argued that this delisting severely hampered BSV’s potential for growth and development, causing immense financial damage. They calculated these alleged losses, primarily based on what BSV’s value *could* have become, reaching the eye-watering figure of $13.3 billion. The lawsuit contended that by removing BSV from their platforms, the exchanges acted anti-competitively, stifling innovation and preventing BSV from reaching its true market potential. This potential, according to the claimants, was worth billions. Why Did the UK Court Dismiss the Bulk of the Bitcoin SV Lawsuit ? The UK Court of Appeal’s decision hinged on the nature of the damages being claimed. The judges found the vast majority of the $13.3 billion claim to be highly speculative. Here’s a breakdown of the court’s key points: Speculative Damages: The court determined that claims based on the lost potential future growth of a cryptocurrency like BSV are inherently speculative. Predicting how a digital asset’s value would have evolved over several years, absent a specific event, is incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to quantify with certainty. Lack of Supporting Evidence: The court felt the $13.3 billion figure was not adequately supported by concrete evidence demonstrating a direct, quantifiable link between the delisting and such a massive loss in potential value. Excessive and Unsupported: The sheer scale of the damages sought was deemed excessive and lacking a robust foundation in established legal principles for calculating losses. In essence, the court drew a clear line: while actual, demonstrable losses might be considered, hypothetical future gains based on market speculation are not a valid basis for such substantial damage claims in a legal setting. What Does This Crypto Court Case Mean for Future Legal Battles? This ruling is significant for the wider cryptocurrency industry and sets a potential precedent. It signals that courts, at least in the UK, may be hesitant to entertain large damage claims that are primarily based on speculative future market performance rather than actual, measurable losses. For exchanges and crypto platforms, this offers some degree of protection against potentially crippling lawsuits based on highly uncertain future valuations. It reinforces the challenge claimants face in proving direct causation and quantifying damages in the volatile and unpredictable crypto market. For investors and projects, it highlights the legal complexities of seeking redress for actions perceived to harm a digital asset’s potential. While legal avenues exist, claims must be grounded in provable harm, not just theoretical future profits. The Binance BSV Connection: What Claims Remain? While the bulk of the lawsuit was dismissed, the court did leave the door open for smaller claims to potentially proceed. These remaining claims are understood to relate to actual, provable losses incurred by individuals or entities directly as a result of the delisting. This could include losses related to the immediate inability to trade BSV on a major platform or other direct, non-speculative financial impacts. This distinction is crucial: the court is not saying that delisting events can never lead to legitimate claims, but rather that claims for massive, speculative lost *future* growth are unlikely to succeed. Navigating UK Crypto Regulation : The Broader Context This case unfolds within a global landscape of increasing scrutiny and evolving legal frameworks for cryptocurrencies. The UK, like many jurisdictions, is grappling with how to regulate digital assets and activities effectively. Court cases like this one play a vital role in shaping the legal understanding and application of existing laws to the unique characteristics of the crypto market. The ruling provides clarity on how UK courts might approach damage calculations in crypto disputes, particularly those involving claims of lost potential. As the regulatory environment matures, we can expect more legal challenges and court decisions that will continue to define the boundaries and responsibilities within the crypto space. Key Takeaways from the Ruling: Speculative Damages Rejected: Courts are wary of claims based purely on hypothetical future crypto price increases. Proof is Paramount: Claimants must demonstrate actual, quantifiable losses, not just potential ones. Precedent Set: This ruling could influence how similar crypto lawsuits are handled in the UK and potentially elsewhere. Focus Shifts: Any remaining claims will likely focus on direct, provable losses from the delisting itself. Challenges: Quantifying damages in the volatile crypto market remains a significant legal hurdle. Insights: The legal system is slowly but surely developing precedents for handling complex crypto disputes. In conclusion, the UK Court of Appeal’s decision to dismiss the majority of the $13.3 billion Bitcoin SV lawsuit against Binance marks a pivotal moment. It underscores the legal system’s cautious approach to highly speculative damage claims in the cryptocurrency space and provides valuable insight into the developing landscape of UK crypto regulation . While the case may not be entirely over, the court’s stance on the massive, speculative claim sends a clear message about the type of evidence and arguments required in such a significant crypto court case .

According to a report from My London, Jacob Irwin-Cline went out to a London bar and had several drinks before calling an Uber to take him home.Cline said that he did not thoroughly check the details of the Uber ride on his phone and left with a random private cab driver resembling the Uber driver at first glance, but driving a different vehicle — a detail Cline would only discover after the incident.Once inside the vehicle, the US tourist said the driver offered him a cigarette, which Cline said was likely laced with a rare and potent sedative drug called scopolamine. Cline added that the cigarette made him feel extremely docile and tired, causing him to pass out for around 30 minutes before regaining consciousness.Shortly after Cline woke up, the driver ordered him out of the vehicle. As Cline exited, the driver suddenly sped off, striking him with the car and fleeing with his cellphone, which contained his private keys and access to his crypto accounts.The unfortunate incident comes amid a recent spate of kidnappings, extortion incidents, armed robberies, and ransom attempts directed at crypto industry executives, investors, and their families.

However, Noizat's daughter and another individual were able to fight off the masked attackers.The rise in violent attacks against crypto investors and professionals has prompted an increase in personal security, including requests for bodyguards and private security measures for those likely to be victimized.Magazine: China’s ‘point running’ crypto scams, pig butchers kidnap kids: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/american-tourist-drugged-fake-uber-driver-robbed-123k-btc?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The proposed amendment would come after 18 Democrats sided with Republicans in the Senate in voting to advance the bill on May 20 after it failed a procedural vote on May 8.“Passing the GENIUS Act without our anti-corruption amendment stamps a Congressional seal of approval on Trump selling access and influence to the highest bidder,” Merkley said in a May 22 X post.Trump his three sons are involved in the crypto platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI), which launched its USD1 stablecoin in March. Critics have pointed out that the president could continue to personally benefit from legislation that helps recognize stablecoins like USD1 as financial instruments in the US. Related: US lawmaker introduces anti-corruption bill ahead of Trump’s dinnerAn Abu Dhabi-based investment firm said that it would use USD1 to settle a $2-billion investment in Binance, effectively allowing the president’s family to profit from the transaction fees. Democratic lawmakers have already called for an investigation into Trump’s connections to the platform, which was largely dismissed as “flawed” by WLFI co-founder Zach Witkoff.Stablecoins are just one of many potential conflicts, say DemocratsMerkley and Warren are also planning responses to Trump hosting a dinner at his golf club for up to 220 people who purchased the most significant amounts of his personal memecoin. Merkley is expected to attend a protest organized by the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, in partnership with progressive political organization Our Revolution, outside the Trump venue on May 22. Warren held a press conference with Merkley, Senator Chris Murphy and Public Citizen representatives, calling on Trump to “release the guest list” for the dinner event. Though a few of the potential attendees have publicly announced they were the owners of the wallets who purchased the memecoin and intended to go, the majority were still anonymous at the time of publication.“What is happening tonight — this private, secret dinner — in which individuals who have put money in Donald Trump’s pocket, get access to him, is maybe the most corrupt of all the corruption,” said Murphy, adding:“They were able to pay their way in to get an audience with the President of the United States to ask for favorable national security concessions.”Cointelegraph reached out to the White House for comment, but had not received a response at the time of publication.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/senators-amendment-genius-act-world-liberty-financial-stablecoin?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: CoinGlassSome traders argue that the increased demand for leveraged XRP positions indicates growing institutional interest, especially as multiple issuers filed for a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) listing in the US. However, the final decision by the US SEC should be made in October.Excessive demand for bullish leveraged XRP causes a positive funding rate, meaning longs (buyers) are the ones paying the carry cost.

Still, the current optimism level is nowhere near the 100% annualized funding rate from Dec. 4, 2024, which followed an impressive 7-day rally to $2.90 from $1.33. Far from being bearish, the current level leaves room for bullish positioning on XRP futures markets.Related: Which senators invest in crypto? 11 lawmakers have blockchain-related investmentsFavorable regulation opens the door for new partnerships and acquisitionsPart of the limited XRP price upside can be explained by the multiple rejections of US Senator Cynthia Lummis, Chair of the US Congress Digital Assets Subcommittee, to meet Ripple representatives. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse asked on May 19 that the lawmaker “reconsider and be a leader for ALL of crypto,” and discuss “how to make the US the crypto capital of the world.”There is nothing stopping XRP from hitting $3.50 or even higher, as Ripple Labs is no longer facing direct threats from regulators, which paves the way for partnerships and acquisitions. Historically, XRP has reacted very positively following those announcements, and the $2.2 billion futures open interest could help catapult XRP price above the current $3.25 all-time high.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Ives simply referred to them as a “new design movement” that would be similar to Apple’s family of hardware and software integrations. OpenAI has raised billions of dollars from investors, who view the company as a stalwart in the AI industry following the overwhelming success of its ChatGPT large language model (LLM). As of May, ChatGPT had nearly 800 million weekly active users, according to industry data. These usage trends were behind OpenAI’s massive $157 billion valuation as of October 2024 — a figure that nearly doubled to $300 billion by March 2025.ChatGPT usage trends.

However, SOL needs a clear market structure break (MSB) or a decisive bullish breakout above $180 to trigger the next leg of the rally. Declining volumes during the consolidation phase suggest caution, as a lack of buying pressure could stall the breakout. If SOL fails to breach $180, the immediate key area of interest is between $140-150, and the bull flag pattern would be invalidated.

2025-05-22T15:00:00.000Z,"Semiconductor exemptions don’t matter when it comes to tariffs","Opinion by: Ahmad Shadid of O.xyzSemiconductors scored a rare exemption from US President Donald Trump’s aggressive reciprocal tariffs, but the relief is symbolic at best. Most semiconductors enter the US embedded in servers, GPUs, laptops, and smartphones. The finished goods remain heavily tariffed, some with duties reaching up to 49%. The exemption looks good politically but delivers little practical benefit. Nvidia’s DGX systems, crucial for training advanced AI models, do not fall under the exempted HTS codes. Nvidia could pay effective tariffs nearing 40% on these vital components. Such costs threaten to stall critical AI infrastructure projects across the country. Semiconductor tariffs may compromise the goal of the CHIPS Act. The act promised tens of billions of dollars in subsidies to support domestic chip manufacturing. Yet advanced lithography machines — key equipment from countries like the Netherlands and Japan — face 20%–24% tariffs. Ironically, tariffs designed to boost American production increase the cost of essential manufacturing equipment.The effect of new tariffs is already slowing progress in critical supply chains — just as generative AI and large language models are gaining momentum across sectors like finance and defense. Any delays or cost increases now could blunt America’s technological advantage.Indirect costs undermine exemptions for AIModern semiconductor supply chains are global and highly integrated. An exemption on raw silicon means nothing when servers, GPUs and other finished products face steep tariffs. Tariffs indirectly inflate costs, eliminating any competitive advantage from domestic manufacturing.Indirect tariff costs hit high-end systems disproportionately hard. The effect ripples through AI model training, data center expansions and major infrastructure projects, significantly slowing the industry’s momentum.Tariff impasse halts investmentSo far, it’s clear that the US president’s tariff plan didn’t follow any conventional economic trends or calculated strategy. The uncertain tariff situation stalls investment decisions across the technology sector. Companies need predictable costs to justify large capital expenditures. Ongoing tariff volatility prevents them from committing resources to new data centers and manufacturing lines.This mirrors the supply chain chaos of 2020. At that time, uncertainty caused massive order cancellations and slowed industry recovery for years. If tariff ambiguity continues, we could see similar waves of cancellations in 2025. This would further compound existing inventory and revenue issues in the semiconductor sector.Domestic production is not optimalThe border argument for these tariffs is that they’re meant to boost domestic production. They do little, however, to encourage genuine domestic semiconductor production. Despite subsidies under the CHIPS Act, most US semiconductor companies still rely on international foundries for manufacturing. Instead, they face increased equipment and operational costs.Recent: How trade wars impact stocks and cryptoThe idea that tariffs promote domestic production ignores the reality of global semiconductor manufacturing. Costs rise across the board, putting American companies at a disadvantage rather than offering protection.AI projects face heightened riskThe blockchain and crypto sectors, particularly AI-driven projects, also feel the pinch. Projects depend heavily on GPUs and high-performance servers for mining, validating transactions and running decentralized AI computations. Increased hardware costs directly affect profitability and growth, potentially stalling innovation in blockchain applications. AI developments have just started to pick up the pace in the blockchain and Web3 space. The industry saw increased interest from investors and VCs just a year ago. So, they are still on tighter budgets. Elevated costs can, however, lead to stagnation. We might see innovators and developers exiting the market. The ripple effect extends beyond the general technology sector and could threaten future digital economies. Moreover, these cost pressures disproportionately affect startups and smaller tech firms. Industry giants can absorb additional expenses, but innovative, smaller players face existential threats. This dynamic risks stifling innovation at the grassroots level, harming the entire tech ecosystem.What to expect Semiconductors have momentarily escaped direct tariffs, but the exemption provides little benefit. Tariffs continue to hit finished products, driving up indirect costs across the industry. Instead of boosting domestic manufacturing, these tariffs create economic paralysis, stall critical infrastructure projects, and threaten America’s lead in AI innovation. Policymakers must acknowledge these realities and adjust their approach before irreversible damage is done to the nation’s technological future.Opinion by: Ahmad Shadid of O.xyz.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

When you do, you don’t own enough NFT’s, as art is upstream of wealth. Both will never be this cheap again,” Pal said.NFTs are “the single best long term store of wealth I know and you get to buy it before network effects kick in,” he added in another response.Source: Raoul Pal“There is some validity to the statement that NFTs, and in extension art, become a vehicle for the wealthy once a certain level of wealth is reached,” wrote Nicolai Sondergaard, research analyst at Nansen, calling it a “natural move” for asset diversification.“For traders and investors, further down the wealth curve, NFTs are partially about speculating on future returns,” he told Cointelegraph, adding that NFTs also benefit from the allure of strong communities, beyond just wealth creation.Related: German gov’t missed out on $2.3B profit after selling Bitcoin at $57KArt NFTs may see a resurgence as “digital ownership gains acceptance among younger, tech-savvy cohorts,” if collections manage to move past the “speculative fervor,” according to Anndy Lian, author and intergovernmental blockchain expert.Still, Lian said broader adoption depends on blockchain networks improving scalability and security to “instill confidence.” He added that art NFTs “must transcend hype, anchoring value in cultural significance or utility.”  Beeple’s “Everydays: The First 5000 Days.” Source: ChristiesSome digital artists made millions of dollars through NFTs.

2025-05-22T13:30:00.000Z,"How staking incentivizes trust without burning energy","What if a financial system could run itself not by burning electricity, but by rewarding good behavior? That’s the promise of staking, a mechanism that powers many modern blockchains by turning users into network operators. In this week’s episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Gareth Jenkinson and Nathan Jeffay sit down with StarkWare’s Noam Nisan to unpack how this trustless engine works, why it matters and what’s really at stake.Understanding stakingJeffay began by highlighting how staking is part of the backbone that keeps the blockchain running, and runs itself, with volunteers.“By doing this, they’re saying, OK, we’re taking this task of running the blockchain seriously. Here's some of our money. We're putting it down. We're showing that we're serious about doing this.”To help unpack this topic further and examine the deeper mechanics behind staking, the hosts are joined by Noam Nisan, principal researcher at StarkWare and a widely respected computer scientist who has held roles at Google and Princeton.Related: How to handle crypto trading gains and losses on your balance sheet“So we have this general system with operators... Why would they want to do that? The system, the protocol, incentivizes them to actually run the system,” Nisan explained. “Basically, it can give them tokens for operating the system.”Staking offers what Nisan describes as two distinct types of security: computer science-based guarantees and economic disincentives for bad actors. “If a majority or supermajority, maybe two-thirds of the parties of the token of the staked amount are behaving properly... we can prove that the system acts correctly,” he said. “But you also have what I would call an economic guarantee... if they destroy the system, very likely the value of the token... will go down. So they are the one losing.”PoW vs PoSJenkinson, a vocal Bitcoin (BTC) supporter, posed the classic comparison: proof-of-work vs proof-of-stake. “Do you have any strong feelings about one or the other?” he asked.“The truth is that it’s not clear.. it's really a social question, I think.”Nisan noted that both mechanisms involve trade-offs around cost, control, and decentralization. The episode also explores the role of staking in tokenomics and system design. Nisan unpacks how fee mechanics and inflation controls, such as Ethereum’s minting curve, help keep the ecosystem in balance.To hear the full conversation on The Clear Crypto Podcast,  listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

2025-05-22T12:38:44.000Z,"UK court partially dismisses Bitcoin SV investor’s lawsuit against Binance","The United Kingdom’s Court of Appeal has partially dismissed a lawsuit brought by Bitcoin SV investors against major crypto exchanges, including Binance, for allegedly conspiring to delist the token in 2019.In a judgment handed down on May 21, the court ruled that investors who held BSV through the delisting period (classified as “sub-class B”) were not entitled to billions in speculative damages based on BSV’s hypothetical growth.These investors had claimed over 8.9 billion British pounds ($11.9 billion) in damages, asserting that Binance’s delisting deprived holders of the chance to profit from BSV’s potential rise to a “top-tier cryptocurrency” like Bitcoin (BTC) or Bitcoin Cash (BCH).The court rejected this “foregone growth effect” theory, stating, “BSV was obviously not a unique cryptocurrency without reasonably similar substitutes,” pointing to the representative’s own use of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash as comparators.Sub-class B’s central claim was that delisting led to a missed opportunity to benefit from price appreciation. However, the court determined that those investors had ample chance to mitigate losses by selling or reinvesting in other crypto assets.“They had a duty to mitigate their losses,” wrote Master of the Rolls Sir Geoffrey Vos. “They cannot recover losses that they could reasonably have mitigated.”UK court ruling against Bitcoin SV investor’s lawsuit.

The court ruled it “flawed as a matter of principle,” noting that “cryptocurrencies are, by their nature, volatile investments.”Binance’s limited strike-out application ultimately succeeded, with the court stating that even if some holders were unaware of the delisting, “they could never claim more than the total value of their holding before the delisting events plus any quantifiable consequential losses.”Related: Binance wants arbitration for all members of securities class suitBinance seeks to dismiss FTX lawsuitOn May 16, Binance filed a motion to dismiss a $1.76 billion lawsuit filed by the FTX estate, arguing that the claims are legally flawed and an attempt to shift responsibility for FTX’s collapse.The exchange stated the downfall of FTX stemmed from internal fraud, not external manipulation, citing Sam Bankman-Fried’s conviction on multiple fraud charges.Binance has asked the court to dismiss all claims with prejudice.

2025-05-22T10:21:18.000Z,"Can ChatGPT-powered AI agents really trade crypto for you?","Key takeawaysChatGPT-powered AI agents automate trading tasks using natural language prompts and API integrations, improving speed and consistency.Successes occur when ChatGPT is used as a support tool, not a fully autonomous trading system.Failures happen when traders over-rely on ChatGPT without real-time data, proper risk management or manual oversight.Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance.What if a crypto trader didn’t need to constantly check charts, worry about emotions, or stay up all night watching for sudden price swings? What if those tasks could be handled by an intelligent agent that understands instructions in plain English — and reacts within milliseconds? That’s where ChatGPT-powered AI agents come in.These tools combine natural language processing with real-time trading logic to automate decision-making in one of the world’s most volatile markets. From rebalancing portfolios to reacting to market sentiment, ChatGPT is being adapted to act as a trading assistant, risk manager and market analyst — all rolled into one. But can it truly match or even outperform human intuition? This article explores how far these agents have come, where they shine and where they still fall short.How ChatGPT-powered AI agents operate in cryptocurrency marketsChatGPT-powered AI agents are changing how people interact with crypto markets. These tools combine ChatGPT’s language abilities with external trading tools and APIs to help users monitor prices, understand trends and even place trades automatically. Instead of just reacting to charts or numbers, ChatGPT can understand plain language commands like “Buy Ethereum if the price drops below $2,000” or “Sell Bitcoin if RSI goes above 70.”These AI trading assistants can work with major platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, OKX and other centralized or decentralized exchanges and can also tap into decentralized finance (DeFi) tools and smart contracts. With the right setup, ChatGPT can help automate trading strategies based on both technical data and market news.Success stories vs. failures in ChatGPT-powered crypto tradingSome traders have used ChatGPT to assist in automating parts of their crypto trading processes, particularly for strategy generation and sentiment analysis. For example, a user shared on Reddit that they used a ChatGPT-based AI agent for technical analysis on Ether (ETH), feeding it four-hour and daily chart screenshots. By interpreting market sentiment, support and resistance zones, and other indicators, they managed to make $6,500 in profits.Similarly, in the broader crypto sector, ChatGPT has been applied to support project development activities such as drafting white papers and marketing content. A notable example is the launch of the “TURBO” memecoin, which reportedly reached a market capitalization of over $50 million in 2024. In this case, ChatGPT was used to streamline documentation and communication rather than manage trading activity, illustrating its usefulness as a support tool in crypto-related initiatives.However, limitations are evident when ChatGPT is applied beyond its core design. While ChatGPT could suggest a trading portfolio and explain its reasoning clearly, it lacks access to real-time market data and couldn’t respond to sudden volatility. In one instance, ChatGPT was allocated $100 across multiple tokens but failed to actively manage the portfolio as prices fluctuated. This resulted in missed opportunities and underperformance compared to dynamic algorithmic strategies.Individual experiences reinforce these observations. A Redditor exposed a scam where a YouTuber promoted a “ChatGPT trading bot” tutorial that led users to deploy malicious smart contracts. The contracts, generated using ChatGPT and passed off as safe, were designed to drain user wallets once funded. Victims collectively lost $17,240 in ETH, highlighting the danger of blindly trusting AI-generated code without proper auditing.Even when asked, “If I use ChatGPT to build an AI agent for crypto trading, can I become a millionaire?” ChatGPT responded with a realistic outlook — acknowledging that while it’s possible, success depends on having a profitable strategy, disciplined risk management, and the ability to scale effectively.Here is ChatGPT’s response:These cases suggest that while ChatGPT can support certain elements of the trading process, it should not be treated as a standalone solution for autonomous crypto trading.AI in crypto trading: Key benefits and limitationsAI tools like ChatGPT are increasingly being integrated into crypto trading workflows to improve speed, accuracy and efficiency. While they offer important advantages, they also carry specific limitations that traders must actively manage. Below are the main benefits and challenges:Key benefits of using AI for crypto tradingAI bots can execute trades in milliseconds, crucial for capturing opportunities in fast-moving crypto markets.Bots follow pre-programmed rules precisely, eliminating emotional biases that often affect human traders.Crypto markets are always open, and AI bots can monitor and act around the clock without interruption.A single bot can manage multiple trading pairs, exchanges and strategies simultaneously.ChatGPT can understand specific prompts like “Rebalance every Monday” or “Set stop-loss at 5%,” allowing flexible automation.Limitations of ChatGPT in cryptocurrency tradingChatGPT does not access live market data unless specifically integrated with external APIs (e.g., TradingView, CoinMarketCap or exchange websockets).Instructions must be clear and unambiguous; ChatGPT may misinterpret vague or complex commands.Improperly secured API keys or lack of two-factor authentication (2FA) can expose trading accounts to unauthorized access.ChatGPT’s cloud-based infrastructure can introduce latency, which could impact performance during highly volatile periods.ChatGPT does not monitor regional compliance rules; users must manually enforce trading limits based on local regulations.Ethical and regulatory implications of AI in crypto tradingAs AI becomes more integrated into trading systems, it raises significant ethical and regulatory concerns that stakeholders across the financial sector are beginning to address.Accountability: If an AI agent executes a harmful or unlawful trade, questions arise around legal responsibility. It remains unclear in many jurisdictions whether liability falls primarily on the developer, the trader using the AI system or the platform facilitating the transactions.Market manipulation risks: Autonomous AI bots could unintentionally engage in activities such as spoofing (placing and canceling fake orders to mislead the market) or wash trading (creating artificial volume), especially if not properly programmed with compliance safeguards.Regulatory oversight: Financial authorities, including the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the European Securities and Markets Authority, are actively studying the implications of AI and algorithmic trading. These agencies have recognized that traditional trading regulations may not fully account for autonomous decision-making by AI systems.Policy developments: In January 2024, the European Commission released updates to its Digital Finance Strategy, which included references to AI-based financial services. While not yet finalized, these draft regulations under the broader Digital Finance Package signal a move toward stricter compliance expectations for firms deploying AI in financial markets.Meanwhile, ethical crypto platforms are beginning to voluntarily disclose the use of trading bots in their systems. In parallel, open-source communities are advocating for clearer audit trails, improved model transparency and the establishment of ethical guidelines for AI applications in finance to ensure accountability and fairness.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-22T08:37:57.000Z,"Dubai regulator clarifies real-world asset tokenization rules: Lawyer","Newly updated guidelines from Dubai’s crypto regulator include provisions on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and clarify rules for issuers. On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) released its updated Rulebook for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) operating in the region. The regulator gave market participants until June 19 to comply with the new rules. The regulator previously told Cointelegraph that it had enhanced supervisory mechanisms and brought consistency across activity-based rules. One of the more prominent changes includes regulatory clarity on RWA tokens. Irina Heaver, partner at the United Arab Emirates-based law firm NeosLegal, told Cointelegraph that the updated rules clarify RWA issuance and distribution. “Issuing real-world asset tokens and listing them on secondary markets is no longer theoretical,” Heaver told Cointelegraph. “It’s now a regulatory reality in Dubai and the broader UAE.”A “viable” path to realize RWA hypeHeaver compared RWAs to security token offerings (STOs), an earlier attempt from the crypto space to tokenize securities like stocks, bonds and real estate investment trusts. However, the UAE crypto lawyer said that STOs “died a peaceful death in 2018 to 2019.” The lawyer told Cointelegraph STOs did not work out because of the lack of regulatory clarity, viable secondary market trading venues, institutional investor appetite and liquidity. Still, the situation is different for RWAs. Heaver told Cointelegraph that RWAs are the next foundational layer for institutional adoption of blockchain and virtual assets. Heaver said that VARA’s new rules already cover them as Asset-Referenced Virtual Assets (ARVA) tokens. She said: “VARA’s newly updated Virtual Asset Issuance Rulebook (May 2025) addresses these failures head-on. Regulated exchanges and broker-dealers in Dubai are now authorized to distribute and list ARVA tokens.”The lawyer said this solves an issue in jurisdictions like Switzerland, where token issuance is possible, but listing and secondary trading remain unregulated. Related: Dubai gov’t agencies to link real estate registry with property tokenizationLawyer shares requirements for RWA issuersHeaver said ARVA tokens are defined under Dubai law as representing direct or indirect ownership of real-world assets, granting entitlement to receive or share income and purporting to maintain a stable value by reference to real-world assets or income. ARVA tokens are also backed or collateralised by such real-world assets or constitute a derivative, wrapped, duplicated, or fractionalised version of another ARVA. The lawyer said issuers must meet specific requirements, including a Category 1 Virtual Asset Issuance license, a comprehensive white paper and a risk disclosure statement. In addition, issuers must have a paid-up capital of 1.5 million UAE dirhams (about $408,000) or 2% of reserve assets held. The issuers are also subjected to monthly independent audit obligations and must adhere to ongoing supervisory oversight. “VARA is providing regulatory clarity, and it’s giving the industry a viable, enforceable path to turn the hype of RWA tokenization into reality,” Heaver told Cointelegraph. “This matters because it marks a shift, from theory to execution, from fiction to framework.”Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/dubai-vara-guidelines-rwa-tokenization-clarity?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-22T08:25:00.000Z,"5 red flags you’re being shilled: Don’t buy the hype","What is shilling in crypto?              At its core, shilling is the act of artificially promoting a cryptocurrency or token, often with exaggerated claims, to increase its price or popularity. But what’s the goal? Hype it up, get others to buy in, and then cash out, leaving latecomers holding the bag.Shilling can come from anyone: influencers, anonymous accounts or even high-profile figures with political or financial clout. The common thread is manipulation: It’s not about educating you or building real value but pumping hype for personal gain.Unfortunately, the line between enthusiastic promotion and outright deception can be thin, and many fall victim without realizing it. That’s why it’s critical to learn how to spot the signs early.                  5 red flags you’re being shilled              Beware of crypto red flags like overhyped promises, anonymous teams, influencer shills, missing products and FOMO tactics — if it smells like a scam, it probably is.1. Overhyped promises You’ve probably seen posts that scream:“100x potential!”“Guaranteed returns!”“This is your ticket to financial freedom!”These are classic shill tactics. Real, credible projects don’t promise life-changing profits. Why? Because there are no guarantees in crypto or in any investment.When a project leads with grandiose financial claims rather than actual product value or utility, it’s likely a ploy to stir FOMO and attract unsuspecting investors. The truth is, if something sounds too good to be true, it almost always is.Remember: The bigger the promise, the bigger the red flag.2. Anonymous or suspicious teams In crypto, anonymity isn’t always bad, but when you’re trusting people with your money, transparency matters.It’s a major red flag when a project has:No identifiable team membersFake names or aliasesStock photos on its websiteNo LinkedIn or professional history.The simple rule is “No face, no funds.”Scammers often hide behind anonymity because they know they’ll eventually vanish and there’ll be no one to hold accountable. Even worse, some use fabricated credentials or hire actors to pose as team members.Before investing, check whether the founders or developers have any verifiable history. Do they have prior experience in blockchain or startups? Have they launched anything successful before?3. Influencer spam and paid promotions One day, no one’s talking about a particular coin — the next, your feed is flooded with influencers hyping it up. Sound familiar?This sudden burst of attention is often coordinated with a paid promotion campaign disguised as “genuine enthusiasm.”Many influencers fail to disclose sponsorships, even though it’s required by law in many countries. The US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have cracked down on this in recent years.Take, for example:Kim Kardashian, who was fined $1.26 million in 2022 for promoting EthereumMax without proper disclosure.Floyd Mayweather Jr., who was sued for endorsing the same project at a paid event.BitBoy (Ben Armstrong), who faced legal action in multiple lawsuits for promoting scam tokens to his audience.If you notice multiple influencers promoting the same project in a short time, especially without using labels like #ad or #sponsored, it’s a strong indicator of a shill campaign.Don’t mistake volume for value. Hype doesn’t equal legitimacy.4. No real product or roadmapIf you visit the project’s website, it looks sleek, maybe even impressive. But where’s the product? Where’s the code?Shilled tokens often rely on flashy marketing but have no working application, no GitHub code and no actual use case. Everything is either “coming soon” or buried behind vague promises.Ask yourself:Can I use the platform or app today?Is there a white paper that makes sense?Do they have public repositories or open development?If all you’re seeing is a landing page and a vague roadmap that’s been “coming soon” for months, that’s a major red flag.5. Pressure tactics and FOMO Time pressure is a psychological weapon, and shillers know how to use it.Watch out for lines such as:“Presale ends in 2 hours!”“Only 1,000 spots left!”“If you don’t buy now, you’ll miss out forever!”These tactics prey on your fear of missing out (FOMO) and push you into making impulsive decisions without research.But crypto isn’t a sprint; it’s a long-term game. Anyone trying to rush you into buying likely has something to hide. Solid investments don’t need fake urgency.Take a breath, step back, and ask yourself: Am I buying because I believe in this project or because I’m being manipulated?Did you know? The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) secured a $128-million judgment against Ryan Mitchell Pope, Daniel Samuel Bishop and their company EmpiresX for operating a fraudulent forex and cryptocurrency investment scheme that defrauded over 12,500 victims.                  Is shilling illegal in crypto? Can influencers be sued?              Shilling isn’t just unethical in many cases — it’s also illegal.In the world of crypto, undisclosed promotions are a major legal risk. If someone is paid to promote a token or project but fails to reveal that financial connection, they could face fines, lawsuits or even criminal charges. This is especially true if the promoted token is later classified as a security under US law.Regulators like the SEC, FTC and CFTC have all cracked down on this behavior. Their targets have included:Influencers who failed to disclose paid promotionsPromoters who misled investors with false claimsIndividuals who ran pump-and-dump schemes using social media.Francier Obando Pinillo, a pastor from Miami, was indicted on 26 fraud counts for running a crypto scam through “Solano Fi,” defrauding investors of millions from 2021 to 2023. He allegedly used his church, social media and false promises of 34.9% monthly returns to lure victims. The platform showed fake gains but blocked withdrawals, while funds were diverted for personal use. Pinillo was arraigned in Richland, Washington and faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.As crypto becomes more mainstream, expect stricter regulations and more consequences for shillers.Did you know? Argentine President Javier Milei has dissolved the special task force investigating the LIBRA cryptocurrency scandal, a project he promoted in February 2025 that surged to a $4.5-billion valuation before crashing by over 97%. The task force, created by Milei himself, was disbanded via Decree 332/2025, citing that it had fulfilled its purpose. However, critics argue that no official findings were released, and judicial investigations into Milei and his associates continue.                  How to protect yourself from shilling scams              Do your own research, verify the team and utility, ignore hype and influencers, and stay alert to pump-and-dump schemes to avoid crypto shilling traps.Let’s understand how you can protect yourself from shilling scams in crypto:Do your own research (DYOR): Always research the project, the team behind it and the data supporting the claims. Don’t rely solely on hype or influencer recommendations. Look into onchain data, GitHub activity and the project’s utility to make informed decisions.Verify the team: A legitimate crypto project should have a transparent and credible team. If the developers are anonymous or have no professional profiles (like LinkedIn), that’s a red flag. Always check the team’s past projects and credibility before investing.Look for real utility: Does this project actually solve a problem? A genuine project should have a working product or solution, not just promises. Avoid projects that lack real-world utility or are still in “coming soon” stages for extended periods.Ignore the hype: If a token is suddenly trending on social media or being aggressively promoted, don’t let FOMO influence your judgment. Shillers often rely on emotions to push their agenda, so it’s essential to evaluate projects based on their merits, not just popularity.Stay skeptical of influencers: Influencers with large followings may be paid to promote certain tokens. Before taking their advice, ask yourself, What’s their incentive? Verify the promotion is legitimate and disclosed as paid or sponsored. Always cross-check the information with independent sources.Watch for pump-and-dump schemes: Be cautious of sudden price spikes followed by rapid drops. These are often signs of pump-and-dump schemes where the token’s value is artificially inflated by coordinated buying and then quickly sold off, leaving investors with losses. Always monitor price trends and be wary of sudden, unexplained increases in value.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/5-red-flags-youre-being-shilled-dont-buy-the-hype?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The steps include a new, trustless architecture, a native token, and the Seeker ship date.According to the announcement, Solana Mobile will ship the device starting Aug. 4. Seeker is the company’s second-generation device, after the Saga Web3 phone that launched in April 2023. The company unveiled the Seeker phone in September 2024, saying it wouldn’t just be a “memecoin phone.” So far, it has pre-sold 150,000 units.The Solana Seeker has gone through two sale phases: The Founder window, where the price for each device was $450, and the Early Adopter window, where the price per device was $500. Assuming the lower price window, Solana Mobile could generate at least $67.5 million in gross revenue from device sales. For comparison, the iPhone generated $199.3 billion in revenue for Apple in 2024.The new architecture that will govern future Solana Mobile devices is called TEEPIN, which stands for “Trusted Execution Environment Platform Infrastructure Network.” It is a three-layer architecture — hardware, platform, and network layers — that will allow users, developers, and device makers to participate in a trustless environment.Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder and CEO of Solana Labs, called TEEPIN “the next evolution in mobile” and a framework where trust is “verified by cryptography.”In addition, Solana Mobile is planning to launch “SKR,” the native asset of the Solana Mobile ecosystem. \""It transforms the traditional mobile business model by giving stakeholders actual ownership in the platform,” said Emmett Hollyer, general manager at Solana Mobile.

From a broad perspective, the $77 billion in Bitcoin futures open interest has undoubtedly played a role. However, a closer look at the data shows a more positive outlook for further price gains.Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.chThe current 7% annualized Bitcoin futures premium is well within the neutral range of 5% to 10%, which has been typical for the past two weeks. This indicator can easily exceed 30% during periods of strong optimism, so the current level is relatively low. At the same time, the absence of excessive leverage reduces concerns about a rally driven primarily by derivatives.Balanced order books and spot Bitcoin ETF inflows point to spot-driven rallyFor comparison, during the previous Bitcoin $109,346 all-time high on Jan. 20, the annualized futures premium reached 15%, showing a much higher level of leveraged bullish positions affecting the price. Therefore, the current Bitcoin derivatives market appears healthier, suggesting strong demand in spot markets.During the January bull run, Bitcoin’s price on Coinbase traded at a premium compared to other exchanges. This so-called Coinbase premium is not present now, which means buying pressure is more evenly spread out—a sign of a healthier market.Coinbase Bitcoin/USD relative to competitors. Source: TradingView / CointelegraphWhile excessive buying pressure on a single exchange is not necessarily bearish, it can make it easier to trigger unsustainable price surges when liquidity is low. This data supports the idea that derivatives markets were not the main driver of the recent price increases. Moreover, the $1.37 billion in net inflows to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States between May 15 and May 20 further suggests that spot buyers, rather than derivatives traders, were the primary force behind the rally.Despite the lack of conviction in Bitcoin futures, several indicators point to further upside. Forced liquidations of bearish BTC futures positions were relatively low at $170 million between May 18 and May 21, cementing the idea of a spot-driven rally. In comparison, the rally to $104,000 on May 9 triggered $538 million in liquidations over three days.Related: Is Bitcoin price close to a cycle top? — 5 indicators that help traders decideBitcoin options put-to-call ratio at Deribit.

Source: Coin360Bitcoin is on the verge of forming a “golden cross” on the daily chart, which generally is followed by sharp rallies, barring a few instances when the pattern failed. Bitcoin’s strength is expected to improve sentiment in the cryptocurrency sector, pulling several altcoins higher.What are the possible target levels for Bitcoin? Could altcoins break above their respective overhead resistance levels? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin price predictionBitcoin rose above the $109,588 overhead resistance, but the bulls are struggling to sustain the higher levels, as seen from the long wick on the candlestick.BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) in the overbought zone indicate that the bulls are in control. If the price closes above $109,588, the BTC/USDT pair could pick up momentum and skyrocket toward $130,000.The 20-day exponential moving average ($101,958) is the critical support to watch out for on the downside. A break below the 20-day EMA will be the first sign that the bulls are booking profits in a hurry. That increases the risk of a break below the psychological support of $100,000. Ether price predictionBuyers are trying to sustain Ether (ETH) above the $2,550 level but are facing significant resistance from the bears.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping 20-day EMA ($2,334) and the RSI near the overbought zone indicate that buyers are in control. The ETH/USDT pair is likely to pick up momentum on a break above $2,739. That clears the path for a rally to $3,000.Contrary to this assumption, a break and close below the 20-day EMA signals that the bears are back in the game. The pair could tumble to $2,111, which is likely to attract solid buying by the bulls.XRP price predictionXRP (XRP) has been witnessing a tough battle between the buyers and sellers at the 20-day EMA ($2.35).XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. If the price skids below the 20-day EMA, the XRP/USDT pair may stay inside the $2 to $2.65 range for a while. Instead, if the price turns up sharply from the 20-day EMA and breaks above $2.65, the advantage will tilt in favor of the bulls. The pair could rally to $3 and, after that, to $3.40, where the sellers are expected to mount a strong defense.BNB price predictionBNB (BNB) bulls have held the 20-day EMA ($639) support during the pullback, indicating buying on dips. BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bulls will try to push the price above $693 but are expected to face solid selling by the bears. However, if buyers bulldoze their way through, the BNB/USDT pair could skyrocket to the overhead resistance at $745.This optimistic view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and breaks below the 20-day EMA. That could sink the pair to the 50-day SMA ($609). Solana price predictionSellers failed to pull Solana (SOL) below the 20-day EMA ($164), indicating demand at lower levels.SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bulls will try to propel the price above the $185 overhead resistance. If they can pull it off, the SOL/USDT pair could accelerate toward the target objective of $210 and then $220.If sellers want to prevent the upside, they will have to quickly tug the price below the 20-day EMA. The pair could slide to $153 and later to the 50-day SMA ($145). That suggests a possible range-bound action between $120 and $180.Dogecoin price predictionDogecoin (DOGE) has bounced off the breakout level of $0.21, indicating that buyers are active at lower levels.DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe 20-day EMA ($0.21) is trending up, and the RSI is in the positive zone, signaling that buyers are in command. The DOGE/USDT pair could rally to the $0.26 level, which could attract sellers. If the price turns down sharply from the overhead resistance, the pair could form a narrow range between $0.26 and $0.21 for some time.Contrarily, a break and close above $0.26 signals the start of the next leg of the up move. The pair could then surge to $0.35.Cardano price predictionThe bulls have kept Cardano (ADA) above the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders (H&S) pattern during the pullback. ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe flattish 20-day EMA ($0.74) and the RSI in the positive zone indicate the bulls have an edge. Buyers will have to thrust the price above $0.86 to signal the resumption of the uptrend. The ADA/USDT pair could then skyrocket to $1.01.This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the 50-day SMA ($0.69). That suggests the bulls are losing their grip, increasing the risk of a fall to $0.60.Related: Bitcoin enters ‘acceleration phase’ resembling BTC price gains seen after Trump election victorySui price predictionSui’s (SUI) pullback has taken support at the 20-day EMA ($3.73), indicating a positive sentiment.SUI/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory indicate an advantage to buyers. The SUI/USDT pair could reach the $4.25 obstacle, where the sellers are expected to step in. If buyers do not cede much ground to the bears, it increases the likelihood of a break above $4.25. The pair may then climb to $5.The 20-day EMA is the critical support to watch out for on the downside. A break and close below the 20-day EMA could sink the pair to the 50-day SMA ($3.04).Chainlink price predictionBuyers successfully defended the neckline of the inverse H&S pattern in Chainlink (LINK), indicating buying on dips.LINK/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bulls are trying to strengthen their position by pushing the price above the resistance line. If they manage to do that, the LINK/USDT pair could rally to $18. Sellers will try to halt the up move at $18, but the rally could extend to $19.80 if the bulls prevail.Time is running out for the bears. If they want to make a comeback, they will have to swiftly yank the price below the 50-day SMA. The pair may then remain inside the channel for a few more days.Avalanche price predictionAvalanche (AVAX) took support at the 50-day SMA ($20.88), signaling that the bulls are trying to form a higher low. AVAX/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewBuyers will have to drive and maintain the price above the $23.50 resistance to gain the upper hand. The AVAX/USDT pair could then climb to $26.84, which may act as a hurdle. If buyers overcome the $26.84 barrier, the pair could ascend to $31.73 and subsequently to $36.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance and breaks below the 50-day SMA, it suggests that the bulls have given up. The pair could then decline to $18.50.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-21T17:55:00.000Z,"Interest groups, lawmakers to protest Trump&#039;s memecoin dinner","Democratic leaning organizations and members of Congress have announced plans to protest what they describe as the sale of access to the office of the US president, in reference to Donald Trump’s memecoin dinner on May 22. The event’s attendees are said to have collectively spent over $100 million for the chance to meet with the US president.Since Trump’s memecoin project, Official Trump (TRUMP), announced that its top 220 tokenholders would have an opportunity to apply for an exclusive dinner with the president, many leaders in the crypto industry and US lawmakers have criticized the event, saying Trump was opening his office to potential bribery and corruption. The memecoin dinner prompted some Democratic lawmakers to withdraw support for crypto-related legislation in Congress, including the market structure and stablecoin bills.“Trump collecting gifts from foreign governments is unconstitutional,” a spokesperson for the consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen, which is planning to protest near the memecoin dinner on May 22, told Cointelegraph. “Collecting foreign government investments through his memecoin is not much better. American foreign policy should not be for sale.”Source: Public CitizenCrypto industry figures such as Tron founder Justin Sun, Kronos Research chief investment officer Vincent Liu, Hyperithm co-CEO Oh Sangrok, and Synthetix founder Kain Warwick are among the tokenholders expected to attend the dinner at the Trump National Golf Club outside Washington, DC. The memecoin project said all applicants had to pass a background check and could not be from a “[Know Your Customer] watchlist country.”Related: Democrats seek suspicious activity reports linked to Trump crypto venturesPublic Citizen, in partnership with progressive political organization Our Revolution, will hold a rally near the golf club, which Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley is expected to attend. In addition, the Arlington and Loudoun Democrats will be hosting a separate event to urge US officials to “hold [Trump] accountable,” and Democratic leadership in Congress has scheduled two press events on May 22 ahead of the dinner.“Americans cannot and will not accept President Trump’s view that positions of power exist only to benefit the holder of that power,” Ryan Ruzic, chair of the Loudoun County Democratic Committee, told Cointelegraph. “We have a moral responsibility to speak out against corruption, whatever the result may be.”Pushback on TRUMP memecoin affected crypto legislationSome lawmakers initially cited the memecoin dinner and the Trump family’s involvement with the crypto platform World Liberty Financial in opposing passage of the GENIUS Act, a bill to regulate payment stablecoins. World Liberty Financial began issuing its own USD1 stablecoin in March, prompting concerns about Trump’s conflicts of interest. However, the legislation passed a key procedural vote in the Senate on May 19 with support from Democrats, setting the bill up for debate in the chamber.“Many senators, myself included, have very real concerns about the Trump family’s use of crypto technologies to evade oversight, hide shady financial dealings, and personally profit at the expense of everyday Americans,” said Sen. Mark Warner in a statement before the May 19 vote, adding: “But we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay.”Senator Chris Murphy, who voted against advancing the GENIUS Act, called for bipartisan support in amending the bill to specifically bar a US president from issuing stablecoins. He also called on the White House to release a complete list of attendees to the memecoin dinner, suggesting that some or all of them would “try to get something from the president” in exchange for purchasing the tokens. Murphy and Senator Elizabeth Warren will attend a press event with representatives for Public Citizen on May 22. California Representative Maxine Waters, ranking member of the US House Financial Services Committee, announced a separate press conference for the same day, with plans to introduce a bill to “block Trump’s memecoin and stop his crypto corruption, once and for all.”As of May 21, the exact number of attendees to the dinner was unknown. A smaller group of 25 tokenholders also qualified to apply for “VIP tour” and reception — presumably at the White House — with Trump, but the complete list of those planning to attend was also unknown at the time of publication.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/protest-donald-trump-memecoin-dinner?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-21T17:02:48.000Z,"Is Bitcoin price close to a cycle top? — 5 indicators that help traders decide","Key takeaways:Bitcoin market cycle tops are notoriously hard to time, but combining technical and behavioral indicators can offer strong signals.The MVRV-Z Score, Pi Cycle Top indicator, trade volume trends, Puell Multiple, and exchange inflows accurately predict Bitcoin price cycle tops.Bitcoin (BTC) might be approaching the final stage of its current market cycle — a dramatic final rally followed by a sharp correction and, eventually, a bear market. For many, this could be the long-awaited climax of the past four years, and major players are preparing accordingly.Since late 2024, Bitcoin whale accumulation has surged. Glassnode data shows that the number of addresses holding over 100 BTC has jumped by almost 14%, reaching 18,200 — a level not seen since 2017. The biggest market players appear to be positioning for what could be this cycle’s final run-up.Number of BTC addresses holding over 100 BTC. Source: GlassnodeHowever, riding the rally is trickier than it looks and knowing when to exit is notoriously difficult. The lure of higher price highs fuels FOMO, driving investors to buy the top, only to face painful drawdowns or even liquidations.So, how can traders and investors spot the top before the market enters recession?Bitcoin cycle top markersSeveral technical and onchain indicators, such as MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Z-score, Pi Cycle Top, and trading volume trends, have historically been reliable in signaling when Bitcoin is nearing its peak.The MVRV-Z score compares Bitcoin’s market value to its realized value and adjusts for volatility. A high Z-score suggests Bitcoin is significantly overvalued relative to its historical cost basis. When this indicator is at a historical high, the ensuing downward trend in Bitcoin prices is likely.The Pi Cycle Top tracks BTC price dynamics using moving averages. When the 111-day moving average (111-SMA) crosses above twice the 350-day average (350-SMAx2), it signals overheating. In other words, when the short-term trend catches up to the long-term trajectory, a market top is in.Historically, all previous Bitcoin bull runs started with a notable surge in MVRV Z-score, and ended with 111-SMA crossing the longer-term trend.BTC: Pi Cycle Top + MVRV Z-score. Source: Marie Poteriaieva, GlassnodeAdditionally, lower trading volumes during price increases can be a warning sign, often signaling weakening momentum and potential for a reversal. On-balance volume (OBV), which registers cumulative volume flow, is a valuable metric for tracking this process. When OBV diverges from the price action, it is often an early reversal signal. The second leg of the 2021 bull run was a great example. While BTC price was hitting higher highs of $68,000 (compared to the previous all-time high of $63,170), trading volumes moved in a different direction, decreasing from 710,000 BTC to 628,000 BTC. This created a bearish divergence between price and volume, suggesting that fewer market participants were supporting the rally — a classic sign of waning momentum.BTC/USD 1-day, OBV. Source: Marie Poteriaieva, TradingViewProfit-taking metricsAs market cycle tops approach, long-term holders and Bitcoin miners often start locking in profits. Some valuable metrics that can track it are the Puell Multiple and exchange flows.The Puell Multiple Indicator looks at miners' revenue relative to its 365-day average. High readings indicate miners may start selling aggressively, and are often seen near market tops.Large inflows to exchanges are usually signs of distribution, as investors prepare to sell their coins. BTC total transfer volume to exchanges + Puell Multiple. Source: Marie Poteriaieva, GlassnodeIndividually, these indicators can mark various shifts in market trends. Combined, they often align with cycle tops.Related: Sorry bears — Bitcoin analysis dismisses $107K BTC price double topThe 15% ruleHistoric price activity observations might come in handy, too. Crypto market analyst Cole Garner shared his exit playbook based on whales’ behavior. His roadmap includes three steps:Euphoria. Bitcoin moves vertically for weeks, with massive $10,000+ daily candles.Whiplash. Bitcoin experiences its sharpest correction of the bull cycle. The curved parabolic trendline that’s supported the rally is broken — a clear signal that the top is likely in. Meanwhile, altcoins and meme tokens may continue pumping a little longer.Complacency. Measure 15% below Bitcoin’s all-time high. That’s the sell zone. Order books on major exchanges often show a wall of sell orders around this level — a likely institutional exit point.According to Garner, the 15% (or 16%) rule works not only in crypto but in traditional markets as well.Historical blow off-tops: BTC, ETH, gold, Nasdaq, Nikkei, Broadvision, 3D Systems. Source: Cole GarnerNo single indicator can pinpoint the exact moment to exit, especially in a shifting macro environment. But when multiple signals align, they become hard to ignore. The final leg of a Bitcoin bull market is thrilling, but knowing when the music might stop is key to locking in profits.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.
