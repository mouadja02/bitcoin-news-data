2025-05-23T20:56:04.000Z,"Hyperliquid Submits Comment Letters to CFTC on 24/7 Perpetuals Trading","Hyperliquid Labs submitted two formal comment letters to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on May 23 in response to recent calls for public input on the future of perpetual swaps and 24/7 derivatives trading. The letters come after the close of a month-long comment period on two regulatory initiatives launched by the agency in April. Hyperliquid Cites DeFi’s Capacity to Meet Market Demands The CFTC’s Requests for Comment (RFCs), titled “Request for Comment on the Use of Perpetual Swaps in U.S. Markets” and “Request for Comment on Round-the-Clock Derivatives Trading,” seek to explore regulatory approaches for continuous trading environments and new types of derivatives products. The comment period for both RFCs closed on May 21, 2025, following a month-long feedback window. In a public statement, Hyperliquid Labs praised the CFTC’s engagement on these issues, calling them “fundamental to the evolution of global markets.” The following post is from Hyperliquid Labs Hyperliquid Labs is committed to the advancement of defi and its promise in delivering a more open, transparent, and efficient financial system for all. As a contributor to the Hyperliquid blockchain, we believe in defi’s ability not… — Hyperliquid (@HyperliquidX) May 23, 2025 The initiatives were introduced under the leadership of Commissioner Caroline Pham, who has been vocal in encouraging dialogue between regulators and the Web3 industry. In its submissions, Hyperliquid Labs noted the role that decentralized finance can play in shaping the future of financial markets. The organization described DeFi as a powerful tool for improving transparency, efficiency, and user control in financial systems. “Hyperliquid exemplifies how core DeFi principles can be put into practice to enhance market efficiency, market integrity, and user protection,” the group wrote in a statement released on May 23. It also urged U.S. regulators to recognize the country’s opportunity to lead in financial innovation by establishing clear and supportive rules for the sector. The group further indicated how its decentralized model offers a real-world example of DeFi principles in action. Hyperliquid Labs is a contributor to the Hyperliquid blockchain protocol, which supports decentralized perpetual markets. Other Industry Submissions to CFTC’s April 2025 Consultations Several other blockchain projects and financial firms submitted responses to the CFTC by the May 21 deadline. Coinbase, Uniswap Foundation, and dYdX Trading Inc. have publicly confirmed filing their own letters. However, these documents, posted to the CFTC’s comment portal , address issues including continuous risk monitoring, decentralized governance, and regulatory parity between centralized and decentralized platforms. On April 10, 2025, the CFTC announced both RFCs simultaneously, requesting public input by May 21, 2025 . The move marked a continuation of the agency’s outreach efforts that began in March 2024, when it launched the Office of Technology Innovation (OTI) to liaise directly with blockchain developers and digital asset firms.

Its proactive submission stands in contrast to a number of DeFi projects that have opted to avoid regulatory channels altogether. The CFTC has not indicated when it will issue findings or next steps related to the perpetuals and 24/7 trading consultations. However, the volume of submissions may inform future guidance or rulemaking in late 2025 or early 2026.

2025-05-23T20:40:09.000Z,"AI Ethics Confronted: Experts Tackle Generative AI’s Dangerous Line at Bitcoin World AI","BitcoinWorld AI Ethics Confronted: Experts Tackle Generative AI’s Dangerous Line at Bitcoin World AI In a world increasingly shaped by artificial intelligence, the conversation around AI ethics has moved from theoretical debates to urgent practical concerns. As generative AI tools become incredibly sophisticated and accessible, the potential for misuse, deception, and unforeseen consequences grows exponentially. For those invested in the trust and security inherent in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space, understanding these ethical frontiers is crucial. This pressing issue takes center stage at the upcoming Bitcoin World Sessions: AI event. AI Ethics: Unpacking the Crisis The core challenge in AI ethics today lies in the speed and power of development outpacing our ability to govern it responsibly. The tools for creating hyper-realistic synthetic media, manipulating information, and automating decisions with potential biases are now widely available. This raises fundamental questions: How do we ensure powerful AI systems are also safe? Who is responsible when AI causes harm? And what mechanisms can we put in place to maintain control? Generative AI: The Double-Edged Sword Generative AI , capable of creating text, images, audio, and video that are virtually indistinguishable from human-created content, represents a significant leap forward. While offering immense creative and productivity potential, it also presents serious risks. The ease with which convincing deepfakes can be produced, for instance, poses threats to individual reputation, political processes, and public trust in media.

2025-05-23T20:39:38.000Z,"What Are America’s Ultra-Rich Doing with Bitcoin: An Executive Managing $200 Billion Speaks Out, Secrets Revealed","Bitcoin breaking a record by exceeding the $111,000 level yesterday had a great impact on the cryptocurrency market. While this rise was supported by increasing optimism about regulations in the US, it was also a matter of curiosity how high-income investors positioned this asset in their portfolios. According to Michael Sonnenfeldt, founder and chairman of TIGER 21, ultra-rich investors are considering cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, as a long-term store of value, with some even preferring it to gold. “For some of our members, Bitcoin is neck and neck with gold. It stands out as a store of value like gold, but it is more attractive because it is digital,” Sonnenfeldt said. TIGER 21’s 1,600 members manage a combined total of nearly $200 billion in wealth. Members’ portfolio allocations average 28% private equity, 28% real estate, and 24% public stocks. Cryptocurrency investments currently range from 1% to 3% of total assets. However, Sonnenfeldt noted that some members are allocating a significant portion of their portfolios to Bitcoin. Related News: Analysis Firm Warns: “Something Unusual Is Going On With This Altcoin's Data” Noting that Bitcoin has shown the highest performance among all asset classes in recent years, Sonnenfeldt said, “This is a development that increases institutional interest not only with price movements, but also with Coinbase's inclusion in major indices.” While interest in Bitcoin is increasing among TIGER 21 members, investors' attitudes towards volatility are also drawing attention. According to Sonnenfeldt, while there is concern among those who buy and sell in the short term, long-term investors see every decline as a buying opportunity. “This is already the dynamic that creates the market. While investors with a fundamental belief see declines as opportunities, those who are momentum-oriented can be more cautious,” he said. While traditional investment instruments are weakening, investments in hedge funds in particular have fallen to 1%. On the other hand, Bitcoin's digital nature and decentralized structure attract investors. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-23T20:30:34.000Z,"Dogecoin Price Breaks Out Of Bearish Trendline And Enters Ascending Channel Headed For $0.3","Dogecoin’s recent price action has taken a noticeably bullish turn, with the meme coin bouncing off support at the beginning of the week and steadily building upward momentum. Over the past few days, Dogecoin has been on the path to reclaiming the $0.25 level after rebounding from a low near $0.215. This upward move coincides with Bitcoin’s surge to new all-time highs, which has helped to inject new confidence across the broader crypto market. Notably, technical analysis of the Dogecoin/TetherUS pair on the daily candlestick timeframe shows that the meme coin’s price has now flipped into an ascending channel headed for at least $0.3. Dogecoin Confirms Bullish Breakout As Trendline Crumbles According to a technical analysis posted on the TradingView platform by crypto analyst Melika, Dogecoin has bounced on through a long-standing bearish trendline that had acted as a major resistance in April. This breakout is a by a clear validation of an ascending channel that has formed since late April. Related Reading: Dogecoin Falling Wedge Breakout Puts Bulls In Charge, Target Moves Up To $0.62 The breakout indicates a full transition from bearish pressure into a bullish environment, with the price structure now leaning heavily in favor of the bulls. In this case, Dogecoin is now on the path to continue its uptrend from its $0.13 bottom on April 7, and the next target is to reach the top of the ascending channel. A critical aspect of this breakout is the reaction from the midline of the channel, which Dogecoin respected with precision before climbing again. The coin also retested the demand block between $0.1950 and $0.2150 earlier in the week. The failure to break below shows that this region has now turned into a strong structural support moving forward. As long as the price remains above this level, Dogecoin’s potential of reaching the top of the ascending channel is valid. What Targets Lie Ahead For Dogecoin? With momentum now on the side of the bulls, Melika’s analysis projects three critical levels that could serve as short profit zones for Dogecoin traders. The first target is $0.2530, which aligns with the swing high on May 11. If Dogecoin bulls maintain the price uptrend, the second target of $0.2750 could come into play. Interestingly, this target is located at the upper boundary of the ascending channel. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Gearing Up For Major Explosive Rally – Why $1 Is Still In The Cards Beyond that lies the major horizontal resistance at $0.3035. This level is significant because it acted as a support level for Dogecoin in January. However, Dogecoin eventually went on a clean breakthrough below $0.3035 in early February, which has flipped into a zone to look out for resistance. Breaking through this area would not only signal a full recovery from the recent downtrend but also open the door to higher price levels. However, any rejection or breakdown below $0.1950 would invalidate this bullish thesis, as it would indicate a breach of both the demand zone and the channel structure. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.2447, up by 2% in the past 24 hours.

2025-05-23T20:20:51.000Z,"Analyst Predicts XRP Could Hit $11 This Cycle","XRP may still have substantial upside potential before the current crypto bull market concludes, according to market analyst Tim Warren. Speaking on a recent episode of the Paul Barron Network podcast , Warren shared an optimistic outlook on XRP’s price trajectory, predicting a significant price jump despite the token’s recent sideways performance. During the discussion, Paul Barron, the host of the show, focused on the broader altcoin market’s response to Bitcoin’s continued surge past $111,000. As attention turned to XRP in the latter part of the conversation, Barron asked whether Warren was trading the token actively or taking a long-term position. Warren confirmed that he is holding his XRP assets and emphasized his continued confidence in the cryptocurrency’s potential. XRP Could Increase Fivefold, Says Warren Warren noted that although XRP has been consolidating for several months, technical signals suggest a possible breakout is approaching . He pointed to a bullish chart pattern forming on the daily timeframe and said that XRP had briefly surpassed a previous resistance level around $2.55 before retracing. Despite this pullback, Warren believes the overall trend remains positive. He projected that XRP could dip to approximately $2.20 in the near term, but once it establishes stronger momentum, the token could rally past resistance levels and reach a minimum of $5. His long-term target is a price range between $11 and $12, which he believes could be achieved before the ongoing bull run concludes. While smaller altcoins may offer greater short-term returns, Warren emphasized that a four to five times increase from current levels would still represent a strong performance. He also noted that XRP has already gained over 380% since November 2024, further supporting his bullish case. Ripple’s Reported Interest in Acquiring Circle Raises Questions Earlier in the conversation, Barron addressed reports suggesting that Ripple may be exploring a possible acquisition of Circle , the company behind the USDC stablecoin. He cited commentary from Gabriel Shapiro of MetaLeX Labs, who raised concerns about the impact such a deal could have on the broader crypto ecosystem. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The potential acquisition, rumored to be valued at around $11 billion, could position Ripple as a leading asset issuer across multiple blockchains. Critics, particularly from the Bitcoin community, have expressed apprehension about the implications for competition and regulatory scrutiny. Barron questioned whether the acquisition could positively influence XRP’s market performance or, conversely, lead to selling pressure if Ripple were to liquidate some of its XRP holdings to fund the deal. Warren responded by acknowledging that the financing structure of such an acquisition remains unclear. He agreed that if Ripple were to sell XRP, it could temporarily affect the token’s price. However, he dismissed the idea that Ripple would deliberately offload large amounts of XRP onto the market, a theory he previously entertained but now views as outdated. Having engaged with experienced professionals in the industry, Warren stated that Ripple benefits more from XRP performing well. In his view, even if some market participants interpret the acquisition as a risk, he personally believes it could ultimately support XRP’s long-term value.

2025-05-23T20:20:14.000Z,"Institutional Bitcoin Adoption: Bitwise Predicts Massive $427 Billion Holdings by 2026","BitcoinWorld Institutional Bitcoin Adoption: Bitwise Predicts Massive $427 Billion Holdings by 2026 Are we on the cusp of a significant shift in global finance? A recent prediction from Bitwise and UTXO Management suggests that the landscape of Bitcoin ownership is set for a dramatic transformation. They forecast a massive surge in institutional Bitcoin adoption and nation-state Bitcoin holdings , reaching a staggering 4.27 million BTC by the end of 2026. This isn’t just a number; it represents hundreds of billions of dollars potentially flowing into the world’s premier cryptocurrency, signaling a new era for digital assets. Understanding the Bitwise Prediction 2026 The core of this exciting forecast comes from analysis by Bitwise Asset Management, a well-respected name in the crypto investment space, and UTXO Management, known for its data-driven insights. As reported by Bitcoin Magazine on X, their combined research points to a significant accumulation trend among some of the world’s most powerful entities: nation-states and large institutions. Specifically, the Bitwise prediction highlights that by the close of 2026, these major players are expected to collectively hold 4.27 million Bitcoin. At current market valuations (which are, of course, subject to change), this amount of BTC would be worth approximately $426.9 billion. This figure is not only substantial on its own but also represents a significant portion of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply, suggesting a profound impact on market dynamics and stability. This prediction isn’t pulled out of thin air. It’s likely based on observing current trends, analyzing potential future regulatory environments, understanding macroeconomic factors driving the need for alternative assets, and assessing the growing infrastructure facilitating large-scale bitcoin investment . Why the Surge in Nation-State Bitcoin Holdings? The idea of nations holding Bitcoin might seem revolutionary, but it’s a trend that has already begun. El Salvador famously became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender and actively accumulate it as a reserve asset. Other nations have shown interest, often driven by unique economic or geopolitical circumstances. Several factors could motivate nation-state Bitcoin holdings : Reserve Asset Diversification: Historically, nations hold reserves in gold and foreign currencies like the US dollar. Bitcoin offers a decentralized alternative, not controlled by any single government, potentially acting as a hedge against inflation and geopolitical risk. Economic Sovereignty: For smaller nations, holding Bitcoin could reduce reliance on traditional financial systems and reserve currencies, offering greater economic independence. Attracting Innovation: Adopting or holding Bitcoin can signal a nation’s openness to financial technology and innovation, potentially attracting investment and talent. Hedge Against Currency Devaluation: Countries facing high inflation or currency instability might see Bitcoin as a more stable store of value compared to their own fiat currency. While the path for nation-states to accumulate significant amounts of Bitcoin is complex, involving political decisions, regulatory frameworks, and secure storage solutions, the prediction suggests that more countries will explore or expand their strategic reserves in digital assets over the next few years. The Growing Wave of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Perhaps the most visible driver of recent Bitcoin price movements and market structure has been the accelerating pace of institutional Bitcoin adoption . From asset managers launching Bitcoin ETFs to corporations adding BTC to their balance sheets, institutions are finding more accessible and regulated ways to gain exposure to the asset. What’s fueling this institutional appetite? Let’s look at the key drivers: Regulatory Clarity: The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in major markets has significantly lowered the barrier to entry for many traditional financial institutions and their clients. These products provide regulated, familiar investment vehicles. Search for Yield and Diversification: In a low-interest-rate environment (historically) and with traditional asset classes facing uncertainty, institutions are seeking alternative investments that offer potential for high returns and portfolio diversification. Bitcoin, with its low correlation to traditional assets over the long term, fits this criteria for many. Macroeconomic Hedging: Concerns about inflation and the devaluation of fiat currencies have made Bitcoin’s characteristics as a scarce, decentralized asset increasingly attractive as a potential hedge. Client Demand: Wealth managers and financial advisors are seeing increased demand from their clients – including high-net-worth individuals, family offices, and even smaller institutions – for exposure to digital assets. Corporate Treasury Management: Following the lead of companies like MicroStrategy, more corporations are exploring holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets as a long-term store of value, rather than keeping excess cash in traditional low-yield instruments. The Bitwise prediction for 2026 underscores the belief that these trends are not temporary fads but represent a fundamental shift in how large pools of capital view and allocate to Bitcoin. The infrastructure is maturing, the regulatory landscape is becoming clearer in some regions, and the perceived risks are diminishing relative to the potential rewards for many sophisticated investors. Breaking Down the Numbers: 4.27 Million BTC by 2026 Let’s put the 4.27 million BTC figure into perspective. While precise, real-time data on current institutional and nation-state holdings is difficult to pin down definitively, estimates vary. However, this prediction suggests a substantial increase from today’s levels. Consider that the total supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million. 4.27 million BTC represents over 20% of the total potential supply. If achieved, this level of accumulation by nation-states and institutions would make them a dominant force in the Bitcoin market, potentially influencing liquidity, price discovery, and overall market stability. The sheer volume predicted for 2026 highlights the scale of capital that could transition into Bitcoin. A value of nearly $427 billion (at the assumed price point) is comparable to the market capitalization of some of the world’s largest companies or the GDP of medium-sized countries. This level of bitcoin investment signifies a deep integration of digital assets into the global financial fabric. What Does This Prediction Mean for Your Bitcoin Investment? While the Bitwise prediction 2026 focuses on large entities, its implications ripple down to individual investors. Increased institutional Bitcoin adoption and growing nation-state Bitcoin holdings could have several potential effects: Increased Demand: More buyers with significant capital entering the market could drive up demand and potentially the price of Bitcoin, assuming supply remains constrained. Reduced Volatility (Potentially): Large, long-term holders like institutions and nations might be less likely to trade frequently based on short-term price swings, potentially leading to reduced volatility compared to periods dominated by retail speculation. Further Validation: The embrace of Bitcoin by traditional financial powerhouses and sovereign entities lends significant credibility to the asset class, potentially encouraging more widespread acceptance and use. Infrastructure Development: The needs of large institutions often spur the development of more robust, secure, and regulated infrastructure for custody, trading, and management of Bitcoin. It’s important to remember that predictions are not guarantees. The path to 2026 will likely involve regulatory hurdles, market corrections, and evolving geopolitical landscapes. However, the Bitwise prediction provides a compelling outlook on the potential trajectory of large-scale Bitcoin adoption. Challenges and Considerations on the Path to 2026 While the forecast is bullish for institutional Bitcoin adoption and nation-state Bitcoin holdings , the journey is not without its challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite progress, the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies remains fragmented globally. Shifting regulations could impact the speed and scale of adoption. Security and Custody: Securing hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin requires highly sophisticated and trusted custody solutions, which are still evolving. Public and Political Opposition: In some countries, there may be political or public resistance to allocating national reserves or public funds to a volatile and relatively new asset class like Bitcoin. Market Volatility: While institutional involvement might eventually reduce volatility, Bitcoin is still subject to significant price swings, which can be a deterrent for risk-averse entities. Overcoming these challenges will be crucial for the Bitwise prediction 2026 to materialize fully. The development of robust, regulated, and secure solutions for large-scale bitcoin investment is paramount. Conclusion: A Transformative Prediction for Bitcoin’s Future The prediction from Bitwise and UTXO Management that nation-states and institutions will hold 4.27 million BTC by the end of 2026 is a powerful statement about the evolving role of Bitcoin in the global financial system. It highlights the accelerating trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption and the potential for significant nation-state Bitcoin holdings to emerge as a major market force. This forecast, representing potentially hundreds of billions of dollars in bitcoin investment , underscores the growing recognition of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, a potential store of value, and a strategic holding for large entities. While challenges remain, the trajectory points towards a future where Bitcoin is increasingly integrated into the portfolios of the world’s most influential financial players and even sovereign nations. The Bitwise prediction for 2026 serves as a compelling indicator of the potential scale of capital inflow and structural shifts that could define the Bitcoin market in the coming years, reinforcing its position on the global financial stage.

In April, a legal order forced Genius Group to pause its Bitcoin strategy and sell off most of its earlier holdings. The company is back on track and has already increased its Bitcoin stash by 40% since the court’s decision. The latest Bitcoin purchase cost an average of $99,700 per coin. Altogether, Genius Group has now spent around $8.5 million on Bitcoin. While the restrictions were in place, Genius Group filed an updated lawsuit under the RICO Act in the Southern District of Florida. This aims to recover losses from “third-party actions” that hurt the company and forced it to sell its Bitcoin. Genius Group To Launch Bitcoin Academy Genius Group is also focused on education—the firm plans to launch a Bitcoin Academy at the end of May. The academy will include guest speakers like Saifedean Ammous, who wrote The Bitcoin Standard. This new program is part of the company’s larger mission to teach the “ABCs of the Future”. This stands for Artificial Intelligence, Bitcoin, and Community. Genius Group wants to prepare students for the new digital economy. Genius Group operates in over 100 countries and serves over 5.8 million users. Its stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol GNS. The stock is now $0.34, down over 8% and less than half its price at the start of the year. Still, the company sees Bitcoin as a way to boost its finances. Genius Group Follows A Broader Industry Trend This Bitcoin strategy is not isolated. Genius Group is joining the bandwagon of firms choosing Bitcoin as a long-term financial strategy. Michael Saylor’s company, Strategy, currently holds the largest Bitcoin stash. The Nasdaq-listed firm recently bought another BTC for $1.34 billion and is looking to buy more soon. Others are following too. A catering company in Bahrain recently announced a Bitcoin strategy. Similarly, Hong Kong luxury watchmaker renamed itself AsiaStrategy, and Indonesian fintech firm DigiAsia Corp has adopted a Bitcoin-first approach .

2025-05-23T20:00:01.000Z,"Retail Giant To Lose $403,000,000 After ‘Highly Sophisticated and Targeted’ Cyberattack Exposes Sensitive Customer Data","Giant British retailer Marks & Spencer (M&S) is expected to lose more than $400 million due to a cyberattack that disrupted business operations. In a new note to investors, M&S says that the company believes the cyberattack will reduce profits in the fiscal years 2025-2026 operating budget by $403 million, “before cost mitigation, insurance and trading actions.” Says M&S CEO Stuart Machin, “Over the last few weeks, we have been managing a highly sophisticated and targeted cyber-attack, which has led to a limited period of disruption. We have tackled this head on with incredible spirit, teamwork and deep sense of responsibility as we prioritized serving our customers… As a team, we have worked around the clock with suppliers and partners to contain the incident and stabilize operations, taking proactive measures to minimize the disruption for customers.” Machin also says sales disruptions due to the cyberattack, which the company announced on April 22nd, may continue for the next two months. “In Fashion, Home and Beauty, online sales and trading profit have been heavily impacted by the necessary decision to pause online shopping, however stores have remained resilient. We expect online disruption to continue throughout June and into July as we restart, then ramp up operations.” The M&S cyberattack allowed the cybercriminals to obtain sensitive personal information from the retailer’s customers, including contact details, date of birth and online order history. The incident appears to be connected with a broader operation by a hacking group known as “DragonForce,” which has also claimed responsibility for a breach of the Co-op Food grocery chain, also in the UK.

2025-05-23T20:00:00.000Z,"Crypto Biz: From shorting the Venezuelan Bolivar to shorting the US dollar","When Venezuela was experiencing hyperinflation, Ledn co-founder Mauricio di Bartolomeo hedged against the collapsing local currency by shorting it in favor of the more stable US dollar. Today, he’s using a similar strategy — this time borrowing against his Bitcoin ( BTC ) to hedge against the crumbling US dollar. Di Bartolomeo connected with me during Canada Crypto Week in Toronto, where he talked about the advantages of Bitcoin-backed loans and the rapid growth of collateralized BTC lending. In our interview, he made a compelling case for continuing to stack sats, even as Bitcoin’s price keeps rising. This week’s Crypto Biz dives into our conversation with the Ledn co-founder and covers the latest business news from the blockchain world. A lesson from hyperinflation Before Bitcoin, di Bartolomeo’s most successful investment was shorting the Bolivar with US dollars, referring to his experience in Venezuela during the hyperinflationary 2010s. “I was borrowing Bolivars and buying dollars with them, holding the hard dollars and having a borrow [position] on the weaker currency,” he said. He then founded Ledn, a company that lets Bitcoin investors access dollar liquidity without parting ways with their BTC. By borrowing against Bitcoin, “you’re basically doing the same thing, but you are in effect holding the hard money, which is Bitcoin, and taking a borrow [position] on dollars, which is a weaker currency,” he said. Many Bitcoiners have found this to be a winning strategy. By the end of Q4, Ledn’s loan book value was valued at $9.9 billion, according to Galaxy Research. Cointelegraph’s Sam Bourgi and Ledn’s Mauricio di Bartolomeo. Guatemala’s largest bank integrates “invisible” crypto infrastructure Banco Industrial, Guatemala’s largest bank, has integrated crypto infrastructure SukuPay into its mobile banking app, enabling users to receive US dollars more easily. SukuPay said this integration is the first time a major Latin American retail bank has used a crypto-native protocol for its payment services. Banco Industrial has more than 1,600 service locations across Guatemala and has also expanded into neighboring countries. The “key to mainstream adoption of blockchain technology is making it invisible to the end-user,” SukuPay CEO Yonathan Lapchik told Cointelegraph. With SukuPay’s technology, Banco Industrial app users can receive dollars from the US for a flat fee of $0.99, significantly lower than the typical 6% to 10% they currently pay, said Lapchik. Bankers are panicking about stablecoins, NYU professor claims America’s banking lobby sees yield-bearing stablecoins as a threat to its business model, which relies on taking deposits, paying depositors minimal interest and using those funds for higher-risk investments, according to NYU professor Austin Campbell. In a May 21 social media post, Campbell claimed that he’s heard rumblings of “panic” over new stablecoins offering holders interest payments and other monetary rewards. He told Democratic lawmakers that “banks want you to protect their cartel so they can keep screwing your voters.” Although Campbell didn’t mention any stablecoin assets by name, Cointelegraph reported in February that the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the country’s first yield-bearing stablecoin security by Figure Markets. At the time of its launch, the YLDS stablecoin offered a yield of 3.85%. Pi Protocol and Spark Protocol have also developed interest-bearing tokens. Source: Austin Campbell Strategy continues to stack sats With Bitcoin back above $100,000, Michael Saylor’s business intelligence firm, Strategy, has resumed its buying spree by acquiring 7,390 BTC last week for approximately $765 million. The latest purchase brings Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 576,230 BTC, with an unrealized gain of around $20 billion. The announcement came just two days before Bitcoin surged past its previous all-time high, climbing above $109,000 for the first time since January. Like other risk assets, Bitcoin has benefited from improved investor sentiment following the suspension of tariff hostilities between the United States and China.

2025-05-23T19:58:31.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Constructive Market Structure Signals Parabolic Rally Ahead","The post Bitcoin Price Analysis: Constructive Market Structure Signals Parabolic Rally Ahead appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A weakening U.S. dollar amid rising crypto optimism has favored bullish sentiments for Bitcoin in the short term. The ongoing cooling down of the leveraged crypto trading has set a precedent for a fresh rally beyond $111.9k. The rising conflict between the United States and the European Union has weighed down on a weakening greenback against major global currencies. The cryptocurrency market, led by Bitcoin (BTC), has emerged as a better alternative for investors seeking to hedge against macroeconomic uncertainties. Since the Doland Trump administration took office earlier in 2025, three states – including New Hampshire , Arizona , and Texas – have approved the strategic Bitcoin reserve bills in both the senate and House. In the past six days, Bitcoin’s investment products recorded a net cash inflow of about $2.3 billion, according to market data from CoinShares . With the CME futures and options markets leaning towards bullish sentiment, BTC price will soon enter the euphoric phase of the 2025 crypto bull run. Bitcoin Price Expectations in the Midterm In the 1-hour timeframe, BTC price has been rising in a parallel channel since a local low of about $74.8k earlier in April. Earlier this week, BTC price was rejected at the upper border of the rising channel and is now signaling a drop towards the lower border. Moreover, the 1-Hour MACD line has already dropped below the zero line and the histograms have been growing in a bearish fashion in the past two days. In the daily timeframe, BTC price has been following an almost similar fractal pattern to the Q4 2024 bullish breakout. If BTC price consistently closes above the upper border of the established rising channel in the coming days, a potential rally towards $140k will be inevitable. However, a consistent close below the lower border of the rising channel will trigger a rejuvenated bearish pressure potentially towards $74k again.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-price-analysis-constructive-market-structure-signals-parabolic-rally-ahead/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis",cryptocompare
2025-05-23T19:55:52.000Z,"Ethereum on Cusp of a Massive Move, According to Crypto Trader – Here Are His Targets","A widely followed crypto analyst says that Ethereum ( ETH ) is gearing up for a massive swing to the upside. In a new strategy session, pseudonymous crypto trader Pentoshi tells his 863,800 followers on the social media platform X that the second-largest digital asset by volume appears on its way to a $3,300 price tag, though no specific time frame was given. “ETH. Getting closer for its move towards 28xx, flip that opens a potentially big move into $3,300. But first, let’s get there.” Source: Pentoshi/X Earlier this week, the trader predicted that the top altcoin would hit a price tag of $2,800 during its surge, noting that dips during this period would be optimal for buying. “I wouldn’t sleep on ETH here either. It has had a nice reclaim at a key high-time frame (HTF) level as well as 200-day moving average. Price has been brought back up now, but still four hours out from the close yet. $2,800 is [in my opinion] highly likely in the short term. Dips [are] likely for buying for now.” Source: Pentoshi/X Ethereum has yet to reach Pentoshi’s prediction of $2,800 this cycle, though it got close and peaked around $2,700. ETH is trading for $2,577 at time of writing, a 3.5% decrease during the last 24 hours.

2025-05-23T19:55:26.000Z,"US prediction market Kalshi now accepts SOL deposits","The US-based prediction market Kalshi has made SOL deposits possible. Customers can add funds to their Solana accounts in this way. This follows the addition of support for Bitcoin deposits. Kalshi and Zero Hash have decided to collaborate in order to make the Solana deposits possible. In addition to managing the transaction process and changing the contributions into US dollars, the company is also in charge of guaranteeing security and regulatory compliance. 🚨JUST IN: U.S.-based prediction market @Kalshi has enabled SOL deposits, allowing users to fund their accounts with Solana for the first time. pic.twitter.com/VJfN7JbVDg — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) May 23, 2025 This move to allow SOL deposits is designed to boost activity on the platform, which has been proven to have many crypto users. It is also meant to increase trading volume on crypto-related event contracts. Kalshi strategic partnerships for expansion The exchange and prediction market, which is regulated by the CFTC and lets investors trade on how real-life events will turn out, originally only accepted USD Coin (USDC) as a form of crypto deposit. Kalshi Circle’s USDC for bets received up to $25M in deposits during the US election season. In early 2025, Kalshi achieved monthly volumes of around $13M, with a peak of $26M in October 2024. In early April, it added Bitcoin payments made through the Bitcoin network to the list of crypto deposits it accepts. Kalshi has over 50 crypto-specific markets where users can trade contracts based on Bitcoin price thresholds, legislative events, and adoption milestones. For instance, markets for betting on coins’ 2025 highs and lows, as well as on headlines such as US President Donald Trump’s proposed National Bitcoin Reserve. The platform has over 300 markets in 12 main categories. Several strategic relationships have led to the new integration. Kalshi and World App just released a mini app that lets users access regulated prediction markets from the World App interface. Users can also use Worldcoin (WLD) to pay their Kalshi account. This week, Kalshi announced its integration with Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI to offer AI-generated information for betting on events that happen in the real world. Although it was called off , this still shows that the company has plans to expand. Kalshi’s competes with Polymarket Prediction markets, in particular, are starting to disrupt the sector. They’re growing fast in the US, and they’re not regulated the same way as traditional sports betting or online gambling. With both Kalshi and Polymarket, they are currently legal in all 50 states. Polymarket has been doing quite well because it doesn’t charge any fees to trade. Therefore, users can easily buy and sell shares, like betting on and against outcomes. If a user wants to cash out USDC, it costs 1.5%. However, the network fees are very low because it’s based on Polygon. Polymarket announced on March 25 that users can deposit SOL into their wallets. This to some extent has influenced Kalshi, its biggest competitor. In a now-deleted podcast segment, Kalshi CEO admits enlisting influencers to dis Polymarket. On the other hand, Kalshi charges 2% for each account withdrawal. They also charge a 1% trading fee that can’t be more than 10% of net profits and a 10% settlement fee on net wins. The fees differ for each payment method when you deposit or take money. In addition, Polymarket works in a bit of a legal gray area. Its website doesn’t list any official rules. This has made it blocked in several countries. There are some risks when it comes to clear laws and market trickery. For instance, it was accused of fraud after a $7 million market was allegedly manipulated by UMA whales. However, many users are interested in trends like Polymarket’s decentralized, blockchain-based website. This is what Kalshi has become interested in. With Kalshi, users can also use regular money, and the CFTC fully regulates it. This makes it easy to use, especially for more traditional people. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Ethereum eyes a breakout past $3,000, Shiba Inu gains 20% in a month, and AI-powered Unilabs draws whale interest. Table of Contents Unilabs: A new DeFi crypto to buy this cycle Ethereum: Primed for a breakout? Shiba Inu: 20% gain in the past month Unilabs: Why Ethereum and Shiba Inu whales are showing interest While it has been an exciting week for Bitcoin after registering a new high, the same can’t be said for altcoins. The Ethereum price has been underwhelming despite BTC crossing $111,000, but a bounce might be close. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu coin whales have been doubling down on Unilabs (UNIL) , a new ICO. This new player stands out for its deep AI integration and blend of TradFi and DeFi. Its unique value proposition revolves around identifying high-potential digital assets early through artificial intelligence, thereby assisting retail traders to maximize gains — an AI-backed DeFi asset manager. With the UNIL token in presale, it is on experts’ lists of the best AI coins to buy now. You might also like: Bitcoin’s pullback from $111K wiped out $560M in crypto liquidation wave Unilabs: A new DeFi crypto to buy this cycle Unilabs , an emerging AI-DeFi coin, stands out in the ICO scene for its novelty. Early funding surpassing $810,000 highlights its upside potential and, most importantly, real-world applications. With over $30 million in Assets Under Management (AUM) as of the second quarter of 2025, the increasing demand and interest in this AI-driven DeFi asset manager is understandable. The goal of the platform is to democratize access to alpha by equipping retail investors with AI-enhanced portfolios and transparent performance metrics for better investment decisions. Key features include a mining pool, flash loan accelerator, stablecoin savings account, self-custodial asset value and cross-chain trading hub. Unlike conventional protocols, the UNIL protocol will operate a state-of-the-art mining pool with cutting-edge hardware. Further, its DEX aggregator will be compatible with multiple blockchains. Equally important, users will have full ownership and protection over their digital assets, self-custodial storage solutions. Ethereum: Primed for a breakout? Despite recording a 65% monthly gain, the Ethereum price has been underwhelming these past few days, especially with BTC reaching a new peak. It consolidated around $2,600, down from its 30-day high of $2,736. Nevertheless, the moving averages flash “strong buy.” The 9-HMA and 20-VWMA suggest now might be a great time to stack up. Reclaiming its monthly peak might ignite a rally toward $3,000, making the current Ethereum price a good entry. In addition, experts believe the Layer-1 altcoin is among this cycle’s best DeFi tokens to buy, especially with the ETH ETFs. Washigorira, a leading expert on Crypto Twitter, expects the Ethereum price to range between $3,000 and $3,500 in the coming weeks. VECTORCP, another crypto expert, echoes this bullish Ethereum price prediction — a run toward $3,200 and $3,800. Shiba Inu: 20% gain in the past month Like the rest of the crypto market, the Shiba Inu coin performed well this month — a 20% upswing in the past 30 days. The bulls maintain the $0.000015 price level, with a breakout expected to ignite a run toward $0.00002. BezosCrypto, with an optimistic outlook, targets $0.00017 this cycle, a bold Shiba Inu price prediction. LordOfAlts, also optimistic, believes the Shiba Inu coin rally is just starting, identifying the growing adoption of Shibarium as a bullish catalyst. At the same time, the Awesome Oscillator, Momentum (10) and 9-HMA suggest a big leap in the Shiba Inu coin price. However, given its strong memetic appeal and growing shift towards AI, Unilabs might be a more promising alternative this year. Unilabs: Why Ethereum and Shiba Inu whales are showing interest The UNIL presale races toward $1 million in funding, propelled by growing whale interest. Its higher upside potential as a low-cap coin makes it a more compelling alternative than the Shiba Inu coin. In addition, traders don’t need to break the bank before positioning for gains, unlike the high Ethereum price. To learn more about Unilabs, visit the official website , and Telegram .

2025-05-23T19:39:35.000Z,"Trump’s Meme Coin Dinner Draws Billionaires, Basketball Stars, and Fierce Criticism","A high-dollar gathering at President Donald Trump’s Virginia golf club has ignited a storm of ethical debates, blending crypto spectacle with accusations of constitutional overreach. The Thursday dinner, reserved for the top 220 holders of the head of state’s TRUMP meme coin, attracted billionaires, celebrities, and a cascade of legal threats, with critics calling it a gateway for foreign influence peddling. The Price of Proximity Entry to the event required holding TRUMP tokens, and reports indicate that attendees collectively spent as much as $394 million on the meme coin to sit at the president’s table. The gathering included crypto elites such as Tron founder Justin Sun, who is also an investor in the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial project. The businessman, who topped a publicly posted leaderboard with a $18.5 million stash, flaunted clips of himself at the event, even claiming he had received a Trump Golden Tourbillon watch from the president. This raised eyebrows, given that the SEC is investigating him over allegations of fraud, although the matter was paused abruptly in February. While former NBA star Lamar Odom made no secret of his presence at the Trump National Golf Club, most attendees remained anonymous, using nicknames on the leaderboard. Protestors reportedly lined up at the venue’s entrance, waving signs that read “Crypto corruption” and “America is not for sale.” Blockchain data shared by Bloomberg shows that more than half of the guests likely live outside the United States, with many buying their tokens from offshore crypto exchanges that claim to exclude American users. This detail alone raised concerns that foreign actors could exploit crypto to circumvent U.S. campaign finance laws. In response, 35 members of Congress have signed a letter calling for an investigation by the Department of Justice, citing possible violations of the emoluments clause in the Constitution. Meanwhile, Representative Maxine Waters has rolled out the “Stop TRUMP in Crypto Act,” which aims to bar officials from profiting from digital assets. Massachusetts senator and renowned crypto critic Elizabeth Warren didn’t mince words either, calling the dinner an “orgy of corruption” at a Thursday press conference . Fellow lawmaker Richard Blumenthal claimed it put a “for sale” sign on the White House. Both called for transparency on who attended the event and how access was monetized through the TRUMP token’s structure, with on-chain records indicating that the top 25 investors alone bought at least $111 million worth of the meme cryptocurrency. Trump Unfazed Despite claims from the White House that Trump attended in a personal capacity, reports indicate that the president delivered brief remarks behind a lectern bearing the seal of his office. He is said to have made no new crypto policy announcements, instead reiterating support for a national Bitcoin (BTC) reserve , before promptly jumping on his helicopter and flying out of the venue. The ensuing criticism doesn’t seem to have bothered the commander-in-chief, with the politician posting on his official Truth Social account, “The U.S.A. is DOMINATING in Crypto, Bitcoin, etc., and we are going to keep it that way!” The post Trump’s Meme Coin Dinner Draws Billionaires, Basketball Stars, and Fierce Criticism appeared first on CryptoPotato .",cryptopotato,https://cryptopotato.com/trumps-meme-coin-dinner-draws-billionaires-basketball-stars-and-fierce-criticism/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION","AA News|Crypto News|Donald Trump|Justin Sun|Official Trump (TRUMP)|United States",cryptocompare

Those funds went into the acquisition of 455 Bitcoins between May 13 and May 22, 2025, for $50 million, at an average price of $109,801 per Bitcoin, fees inclusive. As of May 22, 2025, Semler had 4,264 Bitcoins, purchased for $390.0 million at an average price of $91,471 per Bitcoin. The market value of these holdings was $474.4 million, based on Coinbase’s price at 4:00 p.m. ET, reflecting an $84.4 million unrealized gain. The company’s BTC Yield, a KPI measuring the performance of its Bitcoin strategy, reached 25.8% year-to-date through May 22, 2025, highlighting the accretive nature of its investments. Semler Scientific’s Bitcoin plan is not as aggressive as Strategy’s Since the world woke up to the genius of Michael Saylor, many companies have attempted to replicate his playbook with respect to Bitcoin acquisition. Super BTC Sunday with the 🐐 pic.twitter.com/pcwhiXH2zO — Eric Semler (@SemlerEric) February 9, 2025 Semler Scientific is one of the companies that has followed that playbook, adopting a bold shift toward BTC as a treasury asset. However, it does not mirror Strategy’s aggressiveness, instead favoring an equity-focused approach. Semler Scientific’s pivot began in 2024, when it announced its first Bitcoin purchases, aiming to diversify its balance sheet and hedge against inflation. Like many financial bodies now, the company sees Bitcoin as a reliable store of value, and has leveraged its ATM program to raise capital efficiently without diluting shareholder value excessively. Its 25.8% BTC Yield, driven by Bitcoin’s price appreciation, is proof that the approach works. Semler’s leadership, including CFO Renae Cormier, who signed the filing, hopes to emphasize transparency through the Bitcoin dashboard, and its latest moves align with growing corporate interest in cryptocurrency as a strategic investment. Other companies doing something similar include Metaplanet , Mara Holdings , Riot Platforms, and Hut8.

2025-05-23T19:30:29.000Z,"US Stock Market Plunges at Open: Understanding the Crypto Market Impact","BitcoinWorld US Stock Market Plunges at Open: Understanding the Crypto Market Impact For many watching the cryptocurrency space, keeping an eye on traditional financial markets, particularly the US Stock Market , is becoming increasingly important. Today, the US Stock Market saw a notable dip right at the Stock Market Open , a move that often sends ripples across various asset classes, including digital assets. What Happened at the Stock Market Open ? The trading day kicked off with major indices registering losses. Here’s a quick look at the numbers from the Stock Market Open : S&P 500 : Down 1.03% Nasdaq : Down 1.45% Dow Jones Industrial Average : Down 0.8% These percentages might seem small, but they represent significant value shifts across thousands of companies listed on these exchanges. The technology-heavy Nasdaq index often shows higher volatility, and today was no exception, leading the decline among the major indices. Why is the US Stock Market Facing Pressure? The reasons behind a market move are rarely singular, but current pressures on the US Stock Market often stem from a mix of macroeconomic factors. Concerns about inflation, expectations around potential interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, and geopolitical events can all weigh on investor sentiment. When investors become more cautious, they may reduce their exposure to assets perceived as higher risk, which can lead to sell-offs in stocks. Understanding the Crypto Market Impact So, how does a dip in the US Stock Market relate to cryptocurrencies? Historically, assets like Bitcoin and other digital currencies have shown increasing correlation with traditional risk assets, particularly the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 . This correlation has grown as more institutional investors and large funds enter the crypto space, bringing with them trading strategies and risk assessments that link digital assets to the broader financial landscape. When the US Stock Market declines, it can sometimes trigger a similar reaction in the crypto market. This is often due to: Risk-Off Sentiment: In times of economic uncertainty or market fear, investors tend to move away from assets considered more volatile or speculative. Both tech stocks (heavy in the Nasdaq ) and cryptocurrencies can fall into this category for some investors. Liquidity Needs: Large investors holding both stocks and crypto might sell off parts of their portfolio (including crypto) to cover margin calls or raise cash during a stock market downturn. Algorithmic Trading: Some trading algorithms are designed to react to movements in traditional markets, automatically adjusting crypto positions based on indices like the S&P 500 or Nasdaq . Therefore, monitoring the health of the US Stock Market provides valuable context when analyzing potential movements in the crypto market. Navigating the Downturn: What Investors Can Consider A downturn in the US Stock Market and its potential ripple effect on crypto presents both challenges and opportunities, depending on your perspective and strategy. The challenge is the potential for further price declines in digital assets if the correlation holds. The opportunity, for some, might lie in potential buying opportunities if they believe in the long-term value of certain cryptocurrencies. It’s important to remember that while correlation exists, it’s not always perfect, and the crypto market has its own unique drivers and catalysts. However, ignoring the macro environment, including the performance of the US Stock Market at the Stock Market Open and throughout the day, would be a mistake for any serious crypto enthusiast or investor. Conclusion Today’s lower Stock Market Open in the US serves as a reminder of the interconnectedness of global financial markets. With the S&P 500 , Nasdaq , and Dow all registering losses, understanding the potential Crypto Market Impact becomes crucial. While cryptocurrencies offer a distinct asset class, their increasing link to traditional markets means that headlines from Wall Street can and often do influence sentiment and price action in the digital asset world. Staying informed about these broader market movements is key to navigating the volatile landscape of cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) latest pullback has contributed to a wave of liquidations of futures positions. On Friday, May 23, liquidations on crypto exchanges affected 160,905 traders, with a total value of erased positions amounting to $563.20 million . Out of these liquidations, $418.63 million accounted for long positions, while $144.35 million accounted for short positions. According to Coinglass, the largest single liquidation order was a BTC-USDT bet on OKX, valued at $9.53 million. You might also like: Ethereum, Bitcoin ETFs see biggest inflows since the start of the year Bitcoin traders lost the most, with $153.04 million in total liquidations, while Ethereum followed in close second, with $144.19 million. In both cases, longs made up a majority of the liquidated positions, likely due to heightened volatility. Bitcoin, Ethereum slip on Trump trade war Over the last 24 hours, Bitcoin fell from its all-time high of $111,970 to the $107,000 range, before rebounding back to $109,231. At the same time, Ethereum went from a daily high of $2,731 down to a low of $2,508, before rebounding back to $2,574.

Escalating trade tensions impact risk assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum more than many other assets. This is because traders are less likely to make risky bets in a potential low-growth environment. Still, Bitcoin proved to be relatively resilient throughout the trade war. The asset surpassed its previous high in November, which coincided with Trump’s inauguration. Ethereum was less resilient, trading far below the $4000 level it broke in November. Bitcoin’s resilience is likely due to its “digital gold” narrative. Traders, including institutional investors, are starting to look at Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a counter-cyclical asset, which typically do well in volatile market conditions.

2025-05-23T19:15:34.000Z,"Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance Was Ignored in 2021, Qubetics Might Be the Most Popular Cryptocurrency in the Coming Quarter","How often do people realize the biggest crypto win was the one they scrolled past? Back in 2021, the Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance made noise—but too many chose to wait, question, or simply ignore it. Fast forward, and that pause turned into a missed shot at millions. It’s a brutal reminder: hesitation in crypto often comes with a price tag. Now, another serious contender is stepping up—and this time, the momentum isn’t subtle. Qubetics is capturing attention with real innovation, an engaged community, and a growth curve that feels anything but accidental. Qubetics offers a full-spectrum blockchain solution with real utility, and it’s already creating waves with its presale momentum. Backed by a unique tokenomics model and tangible user applications, Qubetics is not just promising change—it’s delivering. As a project, it’s engineered to redefine secure asset management, and its presale stage offers both accessibility and urgency. If you missed the last big one, this is your chance to act. The most popular cryptocurrency in the coming quarter may not be Bitcoin or Ethereum—it could very well be Qubetics. The Most Popular Cryptocurrency Opportunity You Shouldn’t Miss: Qubetics Regret is a tough teacher—and those who overlooked the earliest Qubetics presale rounds know this all too well. Those initial investors were able to secure $TICS at a mere $0.01 back in September 2024, when the project’s presale quietly began. Since then, multiple stages have flown by, each with a 10% price increase every seven days. If you’re reading this now, you haven’t missed your chance entirely—Qubetics is currently in Stage 35, priced at $0.2785, with the mainnet launching in Q2 2025. Over $17.3 million has already been raised, more than 513 million tokens sold, and over 26,900 holders have claimed their stake in what could become the most popular cryptocurrency this year. The return on investment potential for Qubetics is impossible to ignore. At the current price, an investor putting in $2,000 would receive 7,190 tokens. Should $TICS reach $1 post-presale, the return would stand at approximately $5,385—translating into a 258.95% ROI. If it climbs to $5, the earnings could be $35,900, reflecting a massive 1,694.74% ROI. At $10, that investment balloons to $71,800—a 3,489.47% ROI. And if $TICS hits $15 after the mainnet launch, the reward spikes to $107,700, a staggering 5,284.21% ROI. It’s clear why Qubetics is gaining recognition as the most popular cryptocurrency among strategic investors. This is not just another presale—this is the top crypto presale of 2025. A standout innovation fueling this rise is the Qubetics Wallet—a non-custodial, multi-chain wallet designed for unmatched accessibility and security. Whether it’s a small business managing vendor payments, a freelancer securing cross-border income, or a corporate treasury diversifying into crypto assets, the wallet offers seamless and intuitive control. It’s compatible across iOS, Android, and desktop platforms, making it viable for users in finance, retail, or tech. For those managing $TICS tokens or any digital assets, the Qubetics Wallet makes asset management streamlined, independent, and secure, adding real-world utility that sets Qubetics apart from speculative-only projects. Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance: The Ignored Titan of 2021 When the Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance launched in 2021, it was introduced with ambitious goals to fuse blockchain with cutting-edge AI capabilities. The coin debuted with a modest ICO price, making it accessible to most early investors. Yet, the market was flooded with distractions and competing projects that drew attention elsewhere. While some early believers recognized its potential, the broader community remained skeptical—and that skepticism proved costly. The coin went on to hit significant all-time highs, far surpassing expectations and leaving those who dismissed it with lingering regret. It became a textbook example of what happens when innovation is ignored before adoption kicks in. Over the last few years, Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance has shown consistent growth and has carved out a niche for itself in both the AI and blockchain communities. It has formed notable partnerships, expanded its user base, and demonstrated consistent performance. The token’s market presence today reflects the credibility it has earned post-ICO. Yet despite its substantial growth, many investors still remember the early days—the chance they had to invest before the narrative shifted. While the coin now commands respect in the market, its initial dormancy remains one of crypto’s biggest missed opportunities. Conclusion: Qubetics Could Be the Most Popular Cryptocurrency You Still Have Time For Crypto history is full of missed opportunities—but the smart investor doesn’t dwell on the past. Instead, they act on what’s in front of them now. Qubetics has not only created momentum but sustained it, and the data speaks volumes. Between the explosive ROI projections, the ongoing success of the Qubetics presale, and the unmatched utility offered by its technology, this project is well-positioned to become the most popular cryptocurrency in the coming quarter. If you missed out on previous projects like the Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance, you now have a chance to realign your portfolio with a future-focused asset. By choosing to join this top crypto presale , you’re not just investing in a token—you’re stepping into a powerful ecosystem with real-world usability and community-driven growth. The opportunity is here. The time is now.

Technical indicators show cooling momentum as retail investor sentiment falls to a 90-day low and liquidity data points to price volatility. Bitcoin (BTC) price recently hit a new all-time high of $111,800, but the bullish momentum may slow down as onchain data from Glassnode reveals significant profit-taking by short-term holders (STHs), potentially signaling a market \""breather.\"" Glassnode analysis shows that STHs, often considered traders rather than long-term investors, have realized a staggering $11.6 billion in profits over the last 30 days. This follows a sharp rebound in Bitcoin’s price, pushing past the STH cost-basis of $93,000. The profit-taking peaked at $747 million daily, a rapid increase from the $1.2 billion realized in the last 30-day period, highlighting a shift in new investor sentiment.

Source: Glassnode The STH Realized Profit/Loss Ratio has spiked, with profits now significantly outweighing losses, and only 8% of trading days have seen this ratio at a higher level. This level of profit-taking is typical during bullish trends but often precedes local market tops. Excessive profit-taking can overwhelm new demand, creating overhead supply resistance and halt Bitcoin’s upward trajectory. Crypto analyst Axel Adler Jr noted that Bitcoin’s 30-day price momentum has already slowed by 38%, currently sitting at 19%. Adler described it as a “technical cooldown” after the recent peak. The Bitcoin researcher suggested the market needs a “breather” before potentially resuming its rally. Similarly, analysis from Hyblock Capital advised caution as the previous three months outlined Bitcoin consistently targeting short liquidity zones above current prices, driving its recent highs. However, retail sentiment is at a 90-day low, with only 31.59% of retail accounts holding long positions.

2025-05-23T19:07:42.000Z,"Bitcoin whale James Wynn pushes 40x long position to $1.07 billion","James Wynn, a pseudonymous crypto trader known for swinging massive positions on-chain, has expanded his Bitcoin long bet to $1.07 billion using 40x leverage on Hyperliquid, the decentralized derivatives platform. The final scale-up was shared by James via X on Friday, with a screenshot that showed the total exposure was pegged at 974.44634 BTC, entered at around $109,000 per coin. The size of the position in satoshis (1,073,912,068.95) is a figure few traders would ever dare touch. Source: James Wynn/X James started with an $830 million long opening on May 21, timed with Bitcoin’s price breaching $109,000. At the time, optimism in the market was being fueled by growing institutional participation and clearer rules from the US government and regulators. But James’ play came during a moment when most large traders were taking short positions, expecting a pullback, and he went the opposite direction. Bitcoin whale trims holdings, then reloads to over $1.1 billion Ninety minutes into that original $830 million position, James took profit by cutting 3,688 BTC, worth about $400 million, from the exposure. That reduced the position to $430 million. EmberCN, a blockchain analytics firm, said this was likely an early gain lock rather than a shift in outlook. By the morning of May 22, James returned heavier, as he had raised his position to $1.1 billion, maintaining the same 40x leverage. At that time, Bitcoin had crossed $110,000, and James’s trade was sitting on $39 million in unrealized gains, per wallet data tracked by Lookonchain. Later that day, James again reduced exposure, selling off 540 BTC valued near $60 million. He booked a $1.5 million profit and repeated his previous day’s pattern of partial exits after strong price actions. Lookonchain reported that three previous trims by James had all preceded pullbacks in Bitcoin, causing traders to monitor his wallet for the next move. Some were speculating that James’ exits might be playing into short-term volatility across the market. Meanwhile, amid this, data from Glassnode shows that over 420,000 Bitcoins have a cost basis near $94K, forming one of the strongest support zones of the current cycle. The Fear & Greed Index has also hit 78 at extreme greed in its highest level since January. James originally became known for flipping meme tokens with shocking results. His wallet, identified as 0x507, was first flagged after massive wins trading PEPE , the frog-themed memecoin. He bought 2.83 trillion PEPE for just $8,524, and by June 2024, that bag was worth $44.4 million. In June 2024, James deposited 491 billion PEPE, worth $7.54 million, into Binance, triggering speculation that he was offloading. But he didn’t sound bearish. In a post on X after the deposit, James said PEPE was “still severely undervalued,” and added that the “PEPE takeover just began.” He also claimed, “everyone who bought PEPE was in profit unless they sold it,” pushing back against doubts in the memecoin’s value.

2025-05-23T19:00:46.000Z,"Ledn Pivots Exclusively to Bitcoin Lending: Ending ETH Support Marks Bold Strategy","BitcoinWorld Ledn Pivots Exclusively to Bitcoin Lending: Ending ETH Support Marks Bold Strategy In a significant strategic shift within the crypto lending space, platform Ledn has announced it will discontinue support for Ethereum (ETH)-backed loans and related savings products. This change, effective July 1, marks a decisive move for Ledn to concentrate its efforts solely on its Bitcoin lending services, specifically its “Custodied Bitcoin Loan” offering. This decision highlights a growing trend towards specialization in the competitive digital asset market. Why is Ledn Focusing Solely on Bitcoin Lending ? Ledn’s move to end ETH support and focus exclusively on BTC-backed loans is driven by several factors, according to company statements and market analysis. The platform aims to streamline its operations and enhance its core offering. By concentrating on Bitcoin, Ledn can potentially optimize its infrastructure, security protocols, and customer service around a single, dominant digital asset. This specialization allows for a deeper focus on the unique characteristics and market dynamics of Bitcoin. Key reasons behind this strategic pivot include: Market Demand: There is increasing institutional and retail interest specifically in Bitcoin-related financial products. Bitcoin remains the largest and most established cryptocurrency, often viewed as digital gold. Operational Efficiency: Managing diverse asset types adds complexity. Focusing on Bitcoin simplifies risk management, compliance, and technological development. Enhanced Security & Transparency: Ledn emphasizes the security and transparency of its “Custodied Bitcoin Loan.” By focusing on a single asset’s custody and loan process, they can potentially offer a more robust and auditable service. Aligning with Core Strengths: Ledn may see its primary strength and competitive advantage in serving the Bitcoin community with tailored financial products. This strategic choice comes at a time when the crypto lending market is maturing, with platforms seeking distinct value propositions to attract and retain users. What Does This Mean for Existing Users with ETH Support on Ledn? For Ledn users who currently utilize ETH-backed loans or have funds in ETH savings products, the announcement requires action before the July 1 deadline. Ledn has outlined a process for transitioning or closing these positions. Users are typically given instructions on how to: Repay existing ETH-backed loans. Withdraw ETH from savings accounts. Convert ETH to another supported asset (like BTC or stablecoins) if they wish to continue using Ledn’s services, although the primary focus will be BTC-centric. It is crucial for affected users to review the specific communications from Ledn regarding deadlines and procedures to avoid any disruption or potential liquidation of positions if loans are not managed in time. The platform’s support channels are the best resource for personalized guidance during this transition. Exploring the Benefits of BTC-Backed Loans With Ledn’s exclusive focus, it’s worth understanding the appeal of BTC-backed loans for cryptocurrency holders. These loans allow individuals and businesses to access liquidity without selling their valuable Bitcoin holdings. This can be particularly advantageous for long-term Bitcoin holders who believe in its future appreciation but need immediate capital. Key benefits include: Liquidity Access: Unlock the value of Bitcoin without triggering a taxable event from selling. Continued Exposure: Maintain ownership of Bitcoin, benefiting from any potential price increases while the loan is active. Flexibility: Use the borrowed funds for various purposes, such as investments, business expenses, or personal needs. Potential Tax Efficiency: In many jurisdictions, taking out a loan against an asset is not a taxable event, unlike selling the asset. Ledn’s emphasis on a “Custodied Bitcoin Loan” suggests a model where they take possession of the collateralized Bitcoin, offering a specific type of service compared to non-custodial options. This model typically provides more certainty regarding the handling and security of the collateral for both the platform and the user, albeit requiring trust in the platform’s custody practices. The Competitive Landscape in Crypto Lending Ledn’s decision to specialize in Bitcoin lending occurs within a dynamic and competitive crypto lending market. Numerous platforms offer lending and borrowing services for a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Some platforms offer decentralized lending, while others operate on a centralized model like Ledn. Here’s a brief look at the landscape: Platform Type Model Asset Focus Key Characteristic Centralized Platforms (like Ledn, historically others) Custodial Wide range (or specializing) Ease of use, potential for higher yields/lower rates (depending on market), counterparty risk Decentralized Protocols (e.g., Aave, Compound) Non-custodial Wide range Transparency via smart contracts, no single point of failure (protocol level), smart contract risk By focusing exclusively on Bitcoin, Ledn aims to carve out a niche, positioning itself as the go-to platform for individuals and institutions who primarily hold or are interested in leveraging their Bitcoin assets securely and transparently through a custodial service. This specialization could allow them to offer more competitive terms or a superior user experience specifically for Bitcoin users compared to platforms supporting dozens of different assets. What Actionable Insights Can Users Take? For cryptocurrency holders, Ledn’s announcement offers a moment to evaluate their strategies, particularly concerning lending and borrowing activities. For Ledn ETH Users: Act promptly before July 1 to manage existing loans and savings. Explore Ledn’s BTC services if you hold Bitcoin, or research other platforms if you need ETH lending/savings options. For Bitcoin Holders: If you are considering using your Bitcoin as collateral, platforms like Ledn (with its new focus) offer a way to do so. Compare terms, interest rates, loan-to-value ratios, and custody practices across different providers. For Ethereum Holders: This highlights the need to be aware of platform-specific changes. If you use or plan to use lending/borrowing services with ETH, research platforms that have strong, continued support for Ethereum. Understand the Risks: Regardless of the asset, crypto lending involves risks, including counterparty risk (the platform defaulting), liquidation risk (if the collateral value drops significantly), and interest rate risk. Always do thorough due diligence. Ledn’s pivot underscores that the crypto lending landscape is still evolving. Platforms are adapting their business models based on market conditions, regulatory environments, and perceived user needs. The Future of Specialization in Crypto Lending Ledn’s bold move to specialize in Bitcoin lending could signal a future trend in the crypto lending industry. As the market matures, platforms may find it more sustainable and competitive to focus on specific assets or types of services rather than trying to be a one-stop shop for everything. Specialization can lead to deeper expertise, more tailored products, and potentially stronger security measures for the supported assets. Bitcoin, with its large market cap, strong network effects, and growing acceptance as a store of value, presents a compelling case for focused financial services. Platforms that can offer secure, transparent, and competitive BTC-backed loans are likely to attract a dedicated user base. Conversely, the decision to drop ETH support might alienate users who hold a diversified portfolio or primarily hold Ethereum. These users will seek platforms that continue to offer robust services for ETH and other altcoins. This could lead to increased competition among platforms vying for the Ethereum lending market share. Ultimately, Ledn’s strategy is a bet on the continued dominance and specific financial needs of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Its success will likely depend on its ability to execute its focused strategy effectively, providing a superior and trustworthy Bitcoin lending service. Conclusion: A Focused Future for Ledn Ledn’s announcement to cease ETH support and channel all its energy into Bitcoin lending marks a pivotal moment for the platform. Effective July 1, Ledn will operate with a singular focus on providing secure and transparent BTC-backed loans through its custodial service. This strategic pivot aligns with the increasing market interest in Bitcoin-centric financial products and allows Ledn to specialize its operations and expertise. While requiring current ETH users to transition, this move positions Ledn to potentially become a leading provider in the dedicated Bitcoin lending niche.

The marketplace announced it had enabled Solana ( SOL ) as a new account funding option on Friday, May 23, with this shared an update the Kalshi team posted on X. SOL coming to the regulated prediction marketplace sees the altcoin join USDC ( USDC ) and Bitcoin ( BTC ) as deposit methods. Users can also fund accounts with Worldcoin ( WLD ). Initially, Kalshi only accepted the Circle-issued stablecoin as its crypto deposit option. Kalshi will now look to tap into Solana’s traction to attract more crypto users to its platform, increasing its competition with Polymarket. While Kalshi’s other deposit methods include bank transfer, debit card and wire deposits, crypto has quickly caught on. Benefits such as fast transactions when funding accounts and higher deposit limits are attractive to crypto-natives. On Kalshi, users can trade on any prediction , from politics, sports, weather and crypto. The platform’s service is available across all 50 U.S. states.

2025-05-23T18:50:48.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Soars to New Peak: Is the Crypto Market Overheating?","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Soars to New Peak: Is the Crypto Market Overheating? The cryptocurrency world is buzzing! The Bitcoin price recently achieved a monumental milestone, reaching a brand-new all-time high (ATH) that grabbed headlines globally. This surge in value is exciting for investors and enthusiasts alike, signaling strong momentum. However, as the price action unfolds, market participants and analysts are keenly watching for signs of potential shifts. While breaking records is undoubtedly bullish, it also raises important questions about the sustainability of the current rally and whether the overall Crypto Market might be showing signs of getting ahead of itself. Let’s dive into the details of this record-breaking move and what experts are saying about the road ahead. Bitcoin ATH: How High Did It Go and What Happened Next? Setting a new Bitcoin ATH is always a significant event, and this latest one was no exception. The price surged to an impressive peak of $111,970, a level previously untouched in Bitcoin’s history. This moment was met with widespread optimism, reinforcing the narrative of Bitcoin as a valuable and appreciating asset. However, markets rarely move in a straight line. Shortly after hitting this peak, the Bitcoin price experienced a swift retracement, pulling back to around the $110,700 level. This immediate pullback is a common occurrence after significant price spikes, often indicating some level of profit-taking or simply market participants reacting to the rapid ascent. This price action – hitting a record high followed by a quick dip – sets the stage for the crucial discussion happening among analysts: is this just a healthy fluctuation in an upward trend, or is it a warning sign that the market is becoming overextended? Is the Crypto Market Overheating? Unpacking the Warning Signs The question of whether the Crypto Market is overheating is complex, with various indicators offering different perspectives. Some data points are indeed flashing caution signals that analysts are paying close attention to. Funding Rates: In perpetual futures markets, funding rates reflect the sentiment of traders. Positive funding rates mean long position holders are paying short position holders, indicating bullish sentiment and demand for leverage on the long side. When funding rates become excessively high and sustained, it can suggest that the market is becoming overly leveraged and potentially due for a correction to flush out these positions. Recent data has shown some elevated funding rates, leading some to point to this as a sign of potential Market Overheating . Relative Strength Index (RSI): The RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It ranges from 0 to 100. Generally, an RSI reading above 70 is considered overbought, suggesting the asset may be due for a price correction. While not a perfect predictor, high RSI levels can indicate that a rally has been very strong in a short period, potentially making it unsustainable without a cool-off period. According to reports, RSI data for Bitcoin has been indicating potential overbought conditions following the recent surge to the Bitcoin ATH . These indicators, among others, provide a basis for the argument that the market might be entering a phase where caution is warranted. A market that is overheating is more susceptible to sharp pullbacks as traders take profits or leveraged positions are liquidated. Crypto Analysis: Why Some Experts Remain Bullish Despite Warnings Despite the cautionary signals, many prominent analysts, including those conducting in-depth Crypto Analysis , remain optimistic about the current market phase. They argue that while some indicators might suggest overheating, the overall market structure and participant behavior tell a different story. One key voice in this perspective is Crypto Dan from CryptoQuant. CryptoQuant is known for its on-chain data analysis, providing insights into the behavior of various market participants, particularly large holders (whales) and miners. According to Crypto Dan and other data points highlighted by Cointelegraph, several factors suggest the market might still be in a healthy upward trajectory: Minimal Whale Profit-Taking: Whales, or large Bitcoin holders, have a significant impact on market movements. If whales were aggressively selling their holdings, it would be a strong signal of potential downside. However, analysis indicates that profit-taking from these large entities has been minimal or subdued during this rally. This suggests that whales are holding onto their Bitcoin, perhaps anticipating further price appreciation, which is a bullish sign. Subdued Overall Profit-Taking: Beyond just whales, broader market data on realized profits (when coins that were bought at lower prices are sold at higher prices) also suggests that widespread profit-taking is not occurring at a level typically seen before a major market top. This indicates that many investors are holding for the long term rather than cashing out immediately after the price increase. Healthy Correction Dynamics: The retracement after hitting the Bitcoin ATH could be viewed not as a sign of weakness, but as a healthy correction. Upward trends require periods of consolidation or slight pullbacks to shed excess leverage and allow new buyers to enter the market, setting the stage for the next leg up. This perspective suggests that while individual indicators like high funding rates or RSI might warrant monitoring, they should be viewed within the broader context of on-chain data and overall market structure. The lack of aggressive selling from key players is a powerful counter-signal to the idea of imminent Market Overheating . Bringing It All Together: What Does This Mean for You? The current situation presents a classic picture of conflicting signals within the Crypto Market . On one hand, we have the undeniable momentum of a new Bitcoin ATH and indicators like subdued whale selling suggesting underlying strength. On the other hand, metrics like high funding rates and RSI levels raise valid questions about potential short-term volatility and Market Overheating risks. Here are some actionable insights based on this analysis: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on key market indicators, including funding rates, on-chain data related to whale movements, and technical indicators like RSI. Sources like CryptoQuant and Cointelegraph provide valuable analysis. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: The potential for volatility is ever-present in the crypto space, especially around new ATHs. Assess your personal risk tolerance before making investment decisions. Consider Long-Term Perspective: Many analysts who remain bullish emphasize the long-term potential of Bitcoin and the broader Crypto Market . Short-term fluctuations, even significant ones, may be less concerning if your investment horizon is several years. Avoid Excessive Leverage: High funding rates highlight the risks associated with leveraged trading in this environment. Excessive leverage can lead to rapid liquidations during pullbacks. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): For many, consistently investing a fixed amount over time, regardless of price highs or lows, can be a strategy to navigate market volatility and reduce the risk of buying only at the peak. Ultimately, navigating the market requires balancing the excitement of new highs with a cautious awareness of potential risks. The debate among analysts underscores the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency markets. Conclusion: A Market at a Crossroads? Bitcoin’s recent surge to a new all-time high is a powerful testament to its enduring strength and growing adoption. However, the subsequent retracement and the mixed signals from various market indicators paint a picture of a market at a crucial juncture. While some data points suggest potential Market Overheating , analysis of on-chain behavior, particularly the lack of aggressive selling from large holders, provides a compelling counter-argument for a healthy, ongoing uptrend. The coming days and weeks will be critical in determining which narrative prevails. Will the cautionary signals lead to a more significant pullback, or will the underlying strength continue to propel the Bitcoin Price higher? For now, the market remains a fascinating study in conflicting forces, demanding careful observation and informed decision-making from all participants.

2025-05-23T18:45:12.000Z,"Thief Behind Massive Coinbase Exploit Swaps Stolen Crypto and Trolls On-Chain Sleuth ZachXBT","The thief behind the massive Coinbase exploit earlier this month has begun swapping their stolen crypto. On Wednesday, pseudonymous on-chain investigator ZachXBT noted on Telegram that the exploiter had swapped $42.5+ million worth of Bitcoin ( BTC ) into Ethereum ( ETH ) via the decentralized liquidity protocol THORChain ( RUNE ). ZachXBT also notes that the thief trolled him with an on-chain message that said “L bozo” and linked to a YouTube video of former NBA star James Worthy smoking a cigar. The exploiter later swapped 8,697 ETH for 22 million of the stablecoin Dai ( DAI ), according to the blockchain security firm PeckShield . Source: PeckShield/X PeckShield also notes that a different address that is “highly relevant to the threat actor” received 9,081 ETH from THORChain, then swapped that ETH for 23 million DAI. That relevant address later received another 8,569 ETH (worth approximately $22.4 million) from THORChain. Coinbase says criminals bribed a small group of overseas customer support agents to copy the data of less than 1% of the firm’s monthly transacting users. A recent filing with the Maine Attorney General’s Office indicates the breach impacted 69,461 people. The exchange notes that hacked information includes names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, masked social security numbers (the last 4 digits only), masked bank-account numbers, some bank account identifiers, government-ID images, account data and limited corporate data. Coinbase learned about the hack after receiving an email earlier this month demanding a $20 million BTC payoff in exchange for not releasing the illegally obtained info. The company refused to give in to the hackers’ demand and estimates it will pay $180 million to $400 million in remediation costs and voluntary customer reimbursements.

2025-05-23T18:44:20.000Z,"Bitcoin rallies to $111K with ‘weeks of upside’ ahead; WLD leads weekly gains","Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of $111,807 on May 22, capping off a week of strong gains. The total cryptocurrency market capitalisation climbed to a four-month high of approximately $3.6 trillion, reflecting a 6.5% weekly gain. Meanwhile, sentiment indicators strengthened, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index rising seven points to 78, entering ‘extreme greed’ territory for the first time since January. Altcoins, however, saw only modest gains over the past week, with just a handful of the top 99 registering notable increases by late Asian trading hours on Friday. Why did Bitcoin rise so much? Bitcoin’s latest rally came amid a surge in institutional demand, growing optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and a well-timed dose of symbolic celebration. On May 22 — also known as Bitcoin Pizza Day — the flagship cryptocurrency not only marked its cultural roots but also touched a record high of $111,861, before slightly retracing. The significance of the date, which commemorates the first real-world BTC transaction in 2010, likely helped amplify bullish sentiment across crypto communities. Fueling this momentum, a steady flow of capital into U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETFs has further cemented institutional conviction. More than $2.5 billion in spot Bitcoin ETF inflows have been recorded over just the past four trading sessions. At the same time, major firms such as MicroStrategy have continued to accumulate Bitcoin as a core treasury asset, reinforcing its narrative as a long-term store of value and adding another layer of demand pressure to the market. The broader backdrop also worked in Bitcoin’s favour. A key stablecoin bill dubbed the GENIUS Act progressed in the U.S. Senate on May 20, reviving hopes for a clearer regulatory framework under a potentially pro-crypto Trump administration. Trading activity surged alongside sentiment. Open interest across Bitcoin derivatives hit a new record above 722,000 BTC, or roughly $80.5 billion in notional value. Notably, Bitcoin’s gains came despite a broader decline in U.S. equities, signalling a pivot from its usual correlation with the Nasdaq. It adds weight to the fact that Bitcoin may be stepping out of Wall Street’s shadow and carving its own narrative. However, Bitcoin, along with most altcoins, saw a modest pullback on Friday, falling to around $107,300. While this retracement erased a portion of the week’s gains, it follows a familiar pattern seen in previous bull cycles and doesn’t appear to signal a broader trend reversal. Market jitters were sparked in part by renewed U.S.-EU trade tensions, after President Trump threatened a 50% tariff on European imports. However, analysts see this more as a hardline negotiating tactic than a policy certainty, referring to past interactions with China. What’s next for Bitcoin? While the broader narrative remains bullish, analysts are watching for signs of overheating as Bitcoin hovers near record territory. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 78 signals “extreme greed,” a level that in past cycles preceded short-term corrections. At the same time, Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index was flashing overbought conditions on both the 12-hour and daily charts, sitting at 71 and 75, respectively, a potential warning that the market may need to cool off before resuming its climb. Still, on-chain data suggests the current uptrend remains fundamentally strong. According to CryptoQuant’s Ibrahim Cosar, “Buy orders have become dominant again,” with the 90-day cumulative volume delta favouring buyers since May. This buyer-led pressure contrasts sharply with the sell-side dominance seen earlier in the year and could, he notes, be “setting the stage for another wave of upward movement.” Profit-taking activity also remains subdued despite Bitcoin trading over 10% higher than when it first crossed $100,000. Glassnode data on Friday showed that “older coins were much less active this time,” which provides some assurance that long-term holders are choosing to sit tight rather than cash out. The short-term holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH SOPR), which tracks whether recent buyers are selling at a profit, was sitting at 1.02 at the time of writing, further confirming that the rally isn’t being driven by short-term speculation. Adding to the bullish sentiment, CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan pointed to Bitcoin’s funding rates, which have risen but remain below peak levels seen during previous overheated rallies. “Futures market overheating is negligible,” CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan explained, adding that overall, the market “is still in a healthy upward phase.” Another encouraging signal comes from Bitcoin’s MVRV Z-score, which compares market value to realized value. At 2.8, the metric remains well below the red zone that historically marks market tops. Well-followed analyst Rekt Capital also agreed that Bitcoin’s current rally has yet to lose steam, suggesting in a May 23 X post that it has “only just begun its Price Discovery Uptrend 2.” While short-term fluctuations are expected, he believes there are “still many weeks of upside ahead,” with any dips likely to be part of a broader trend that points toward continued “Macro Upside.” Cycle-end targets for Bitcoin among analysts range from $150,000 to over $200,000 . For example, pseudonymous analyst BitBull believes the move beyond $200,000 will be “real and quick,” following a breakout above $111,000.

When writing, Bitcoin was priced at $109,297, up 5.5% in the past 7 days. Altcoin market recap Over the past 7 days, the altcoin market cap jumped by 6.67%, reaching about $1.44 trillion at the time of writing. Even with that rise, the Altcoin Season Index is sitting at 28, which means Bitcoin is still the main driver in the market. Altcoins are moving, but BTC is leading the way. Ethereum, the biggest altcoin by market cap, slipped 0.4% this week and is currently trading at $2,578. XRP also dipped, falling 1.6%. But others did better, Solana (SOL) gained 5.9%, Dogecoin (DOGE) added 3.9%, and Cardano (ADA) was up 1.4%. Among the top 100 altcoins, Worldcoin (WLD) led the pack with a 35% rally, with a market cap of $1.24 billion at press time. Close behind were Hyperliquid (HYPE), up 33.6% to $36.38, and SPX6900 (SPX), which rose 32.5% to $0.9602. See below: Source: CoinMarketCap Worldcoin’s rally followed a $135 million funding round backed by big names like a16z and Bain Capital Crypto. Hyperliquid surged over 33% this week, supported by record-breaking trading volume and open interest that helped it hit an all-time high of $37.24 on Friday. Most of the gains came after the Hyperliquid team said they had officially responded to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission about new regulations being proposed for perpetual swaps and 24/7 crypto trading. The L1 blockchain network also recorded a spike in network revenue, which further strengthened sentiment. As for SPX6900, its recent rally appears to be linked to renewed community interest following the S&P 500’s decline after Moody’s downgraded the U.S. sovereign credit outlook. Given the SPX6900 community’s ethos of “flipping the stock market,” sentiment often strengthens when traditional financial markets show signs of weakness.

2025-05-23T18:40:51.000Z,"Semler Scientific Makes Bold Bitcoin Move, Reports Stunning 25.8% Yield YTD","BitcoinWorld Semler Scientific Makes Bold Bitcoin Move, Reports Stunning 25.8% Yield YTD In a significant move highlighting the increasing trend of traditional companies embracing digital assets, Nasdaq-listed medical technology firm Semler Scientific (SMLR) has once again expanded its Semler Scientific Bitcoin holdings. The company recently announced a substantial acquisition, adding to its growing reserve of the leading cryptocurrency. What’s Behind Semler Scientific’s Corporate Bitcoin Strategy? Semler Scientific, primarily known for products that assist in the diagnosis of vascular disease, made headlines when it first adopted Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. This strategy aligns it with a small but growing group of public companies diversifying their balance sheets with digital assets. The latest announcement, shared by CEO Eric Semler on the social platform X, reveals the acquisition of an additional 455 Bitcoins. This purchase was made for a total of $50 million, indicating an average price of approximately $109,890 per Bitcoin for this specific tranche. This move significantly boosts the company’s total Bitcoin reserves. With this recent acquisition, Semler Scientific’s total SMLR Bitcoin holdings now stand at an impressive 4,264 BTC. This positions the company as a notable holder of Bitcoin among publicly traded entities, albeit still considerably smaller than industry leader MicroStrategy. Analyzing the Performance: A 25.8% Yield Year-to-Date One of the most compelling aspects of Semler Scientific’s update is the reported performance of its Bitcoin holdings. According to CEO Eric Semler, the company has seen a 25.8% yield year-to-date on its corporate Bitcoin strategy . This figure represents the appreciation in value of their Bitcoin reserves since the beginning of the year. A 25.8% yield in less than six months is a strong performance by any standard, especially when compared to traditional treasury assets like cash or short-term bonds, which currently offer significantly lower returns. This reported yield underscores the potential upside companies see in allocating a portion of their treasury to volatile, yet potentially high-growth, assets like Bitcoin. It’s important to note that this yield is unrealized until the asset is sold, and the value is subject to market fluctuations. However, it demonstrates the potential benefits that companies are seeking through institutional Bitcoin adoption . Why Are Companies Like Semler Scientific Turning to Bitcoin? The decision by a medical technology company to hold a significant amount of Bitcoin on its balance sheet might seem unconventional at first glance. However, it reflects a broader trend driven by several factors: Inflation Hedge: Many companies view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation, which can erode the purchasing power of traditional fiat currency reserves. Store of Value: Proponents see Bitcoin as digital gold, a scarce asset with a fixed supply that can preserve value over the long term. Potential for Appreciation: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin offers the potential for significant capital appreciation, which can enhance shareholder value. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin provides diversification away from traditional financial assets, which may behave differently in various economic environments. Semler Scientific explicitly stated in previous announcements that Bitcoin is a “legitimate investment asset and a store of value.” Their continued acquisitions and reporting of yields reinforce this conviction in their Bitcoin treasury asset strategy. Bitcoin as a Corporate Treasury Asset: Benefits and Challenges Embracing Bitcoin as a treasury asset is not without its complexities and risks. Companies considering this path must weigh the potential benefits against significant challenges. Potential Benefits: Higher Growth Potential: Historically, Bitcoin has offered returns far exceeding traditional assets. Inflation Protection: A fixed supply of 21 million coins provides scarcity. Accessibility: Bitcoin is a globally accessible asset, 24/7. Challenges and Considerations: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience dramatic swings, impacting the reported value of holdings and potentially financial statements. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Accounting Treatment: Accounting for Bitcoin holdings can be complex, often treated as an intangible asset subject to impairment losses. Security Risks: Holding and securing large amounts of cryptocurrency requires robust security protocols to prevent theft or loss. Public Perception: While growing, corporate Bitcoin adoption is still viewed with skepticism by some investors and the public. Semler Scientific’s continued investment suggests they believe the potential benefits outweigh these challenges, at least for a portion of their treasury. Semler Scientific’s Place in the Institutional Adoption Landscape While MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin by a vast margin, companies like Semler Scientific demonstrate that the trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption is not limited to just one or two pioneers. Other companies, though fewer in number, have also allocated treasury funds to Bitcoin, including Block, Inc. (formerly Square). Semler Scientific’s strategy appears to be purely focused on holding Bitcoin as a treasury reserve, distinct from companies that might integrate blockchain technology or crypto payments into their core business operations. This pure treasury play highlights Bitcoin’s growing acceptance solely as an investment and store-of-value asset for corporate balance sheets. The consistent reporting on their SMLR Bitcoin holdings and the associated yield provides transparency into the performance of this strategy, offering insights for other companies potentially considering a similar move. Looking Ahead: Will More Companies Follow Semler Scientific’s Lead? The success and transparency of early corporate adopters like Semler Scientific could potentially encourage more traditional companies to explore adding Bitcoin to their treasury reserves. As the regulatory environment matures and understanding of digital assets grows, the perceived risks might decrease, while the appeal of potential yields and inflation hedging remains strong. Semler Scientific’s latest acquisition and positive yield report serve as a case study for the potential rewards of a proactive corporate Bitcoin strategy . Their actions contribute to the ongoing narrative of Bitcoin’s evolution from a fringe asset to one increasingly considered by mainstream financial and corporate entities. Conclusion: Semler Scientific Doubles Down on Bitcoin with Strong Results Semler Scientific’s recent acquisition of 455 BTC for $50 million is a clear signal of their continued conviction in Bitcoin as a treasury asset. Bringing their total Semler Scientific Bitcoin holdings to 4,264 BTC, the company is demonstrating a firm commitment to its digital asset strategy. The reported 25.8% yield year-to-date further validates their approach in the current market environment. This move reinforces the broader trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption and highlights Bitcoin’s potential role as a high-performing Bitcoin treasury asset , despite its inherent volatility. As companies like Semler Scientific continue to report on their SMLR Bitcoin holdings and performance, they provide valuable data points for the market and potential inspiration for other corporations considering their own digital asset strategies.

2025-05-23T18:31:53.000Z,"US Stock Futures Drop: Urgent Warning on Trump Tariffs and Crypto Market Impact","BitcoinWorld US Stock Futures Drop: Urgent Warning on Trump Tariffs and Crypto Market Impact Are you tracking the pulse of the financial world beyond just Bitcoin charts? Good. Because events in traditional markets, like the recent dip in US stock futures , can send ripples across the entire investment landscape, including the cryptocurrency space. Understanding these connections is vital for navigating potential crypto market volatility . Why Did US Stock Futures React So Strongly? The immediate cause for the downturn in US stock futures was news that former U.S. President Donald Trump proposed a significant 50% tariff on goods imported from the European Union. This announcement, shared via Walter Bloomberg on X, suggested the tariff could begin as early as June 1. Trump also indicated that products built or manufactured within the U.S. would be exempt from this proposed tariff. While this is a proposal and not yet policy, the markets reacted swiftly, extending previous losses. Here’s a breakdown of the key points: The Proposal: A 50% tariff rate on imports from the EU. Proposed Start Date: June 1. Exemption: Goods manufactured or built in the U.S. Market Reaction: Immediate drop in US stock futures , signaling investor concern. Understanding the Potential Trade War Impact Tariffs are essentially taxes on imported goods. A 50% tariff is a substantial barrier to trade. When a major economic power like the U.S. proposes such a tariff on another major bloc like the EU, it raises fears of a potential ‘trade war’. What does a trade war impact mean for markets? Historically, trade disputes create uncertainty. Businesses face higher costs for imported materials or components, and exporters face reduced demand for their products if retaliatory tariffs are imposed by the affected countries (in this case, the EU). This can hurt corporate profits and economic growth. Consider the ripple effects: Higher Consumer Prices: Tariffs can increase the cost of imported goods for consumers. Supply Chain Disruption: Companies may need to find new suppliers or manufacturing locations. Reduced Global Demand: Escalating trade tensions can slow down international commerce. Investor Fear: Uncertainty leads investors to move away from ‘riskier’ assets towards perceived safer options. How Does This Affect Crypto Market Volatility? This is where the connection to cryptocurrency becomes important. While crypto markets operate 24/7 and have their own unique drivers, they are not entirely isolated from global macroeconomic events and shifts in investor sentiment. Increased volatility in traditional markets, triggered by events like the proposed Trump tariffs EU , can spill over into crypto in several ways: Correlation with Risk Assets: In recent years, Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies have shown some correlation with traditional risk assets like tech stocks. When stock markets fall sharply due to fear, crypto can sometimes follow suit as investors reduce overall exposure to volatile assets. Shift in Investor Sentiment: If traditional finance looks shaky, it can influence how institutional investors or even large individual investors view their crypto holdings. Some might see it as part of the broader risk basket. Search for Alternatives: Conversely, prolonged instability or a significant trade war impact could push some investors to look for alternative assets outside the traditional financial system. This is where the ‘ Bitcoin safe haven ‘ narrative comes into play. Is Bitcoin a Safe Haven Amidst Trade Tensions? The concept of Bitcoin as a ‘ Bitcoin safe haven ‘ asset, similar to gold, is a subject of ongoing debate. The idea is that in times of economic or geopolitical uncertainty, investors might flock to Bitcoin as a store of value that is decentralized and not tied to any single country’s economy or policies. Arguments for Bitcoin as a safe haven: Decentralization: Not controlled by governments or central banks. Limited Supply: Capped supply (21 million for Bitcoin) offers scarcity. Global Accessibility: Can be accessed and transferred across borders relatively easily. Arguments against Bitcoin as a safe haven: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can swing wildly, making it risky in downturns. Relative Nascent Stage: Still a young asset class compared to gold or government bonds. Correlation: As mentioned, sometimes correlates with risk-on assets rather than acting purely defensively. The proposed Trump tariffs EU situation is a test case. Will investors flee stocks and bonds towards Bitcoin, or will Bitcoin get caught in a broader risk-off sell-off? Observing the crypto market volatility in the coming days and weeks will provide clues. Potential Challenges and Opportunities A trade war scenario presents both challenges and potential opportunities for the crypto space. Challenges: Increased market correlation leading to price drops. Reduced overall economic stability potentially impacting retail investment capacity. Regulatory focus shifting or becoming more stringent in times of economic stress. Opportunities: Heightened interest in decentralized alternatives if faith in traditional systems wanes. Potential for the Bitcoin safe haven narrative to strengthen if it shows resilience. Increased adoption in regions heavily impacted by traditional financial instability. What Should Crypto Investors Consider Now? Given the potential for increased crypto market volatility stemming from global economic factors like the proposed Trump tariffs EU , here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep an eye not just on crypto news, but also on major macroeconomic and geopolitical events. They matter. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Understand that increased uncertainty in traditional markets can amplify volatility in crypto. Ensure your portfolio aligns with your comfort level for risk. Consider Diversification: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification within crypto (different assets, different use cases) and potentially across asset classes can help mitigate risk. Understand Correlations: Pay attention to how Bitcoin and altcoins are behaving in relation to stock indices (like the S&P 500, which tracks US stock futures movement). While not always perfectly correlated, the relationship exists. Focus on Long-Term Fundamentals: Short-term market reactions to news like tariff proposals can be noisy. If you are a long-term investor, focus on the underlying technology and adoption trends of the crypto projects you believe in. Conclusion The drop in US stock futures following the proposal of a 50% Trump tariffs EU is a clear signal that global trade tensions remain a significant factor influencing traditional financial markets. While not directly a crypto event, the potential for a wider trade war impact introduces uncertainty and can contribute to crypto market volatility . Whether Bitcoin truly acts as a Bitcoin safe haven in such scenarios is still being tested, but monitoring these developments is crucial for any informed crypto investor navigating the complex interplay between traditional finance and the digital asset space. Staying prepared and understanding the potential ripple effects is key to making informed decisions.

2025-05-23T18:24:18.000Z,"Trump Tariff To Hit EU and Apple, Shakes Crypto Market","President Donald Trump has taken a bold step in his ongoing tariff war. Starting June 1, 2025, the United States will impose a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union (EU). This decision comes shortly after the president threatened a 25% tariff imposed on Apple, a multi-billion-dollar tech company. These actions are already affecting the financial markets. The cryptocurrency market is down, and investors are worried about what will happen next. Trump Says Trade Talks With Europe Are Failing President Trump is not pleased with the way trade talks with the European Union are going. According to him, the talks are “going nowhere,” so he decided to raise tariffs on European goods by 50%. This means that products like cars, clothes, and food from Europe will cost more when they arrive in the U.S. President Trump believes that these high tariffs will force the European Union to take the U.S. more seriously in trade negotiations. He also wants to protect American businesses from foreign competition. Apple Caught in Trade War CrossChair Just before announcing the EU tariffs, President Trump made another bold move. He posted a message on Truth Social telling Apple to stop making iPhones in other countries. He said if Apple does not make iPhones in the U.S., he will add a 25% tax to all iPhones abroad. This message puts pressure on Apple, which makes most of its iPhones in China. This is not the first time Apple has been mentioned in Trump’s trade strategy. In April, Trump introduced a tech tariff policy to make imported technology more expensive. He later granted a 90-day relief period , which will end on June 8. During this short break, Bitcoin miners in the U.S. are rushing to import as many mining rigs as possible before the window closes. However, this direct threat to Apple shows how serious he is about reshaping U.S. manufacturing policies. The president wants more American companies to bring their factories back to the U.S. to create jobs and boost the economy. Crypto Market Drops After Announcement Following the announcement, the crypto market reacted quickly, showing bearish signs. The total value of all cryptocurrencies fell to $3.42 trillion, a 2.58% drop in one day. Bitcoin (BTC), the flagship crypto, dropped to $108,000 shortly after reaching a new high of $111,000 . Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest crypto, also fell by 1.82%. XRP dropped by 2.09%. The sudden pullback shows how sensitive the market is to significant political and economic events. Investors and market participants are nervous about how the new tariffs will affect the global economy. However, despite the drop, Bitcoin buyers are not backing off . Onchain data from analytics firm CryptoQuant reveals that investor confidence remains unusually high.

2025-05-23T18:18:00.000Z,"PEPE price prediction: +10% pullback signals bullish trend continuation","PEPE has recently rejected a key resistance level, prompting a pullback in the current uptrend. However, technical indicators and market structure continue to signal strength, with a higher low likely forming. PEPE’s ( PEPE ) price action has cooled off after hitting a clear resistance level, but the broader trend remains firmly bullish. The latest dip is being interpreted as a potential higher low in a healthy market structure, with several confluences pointing toward another leg up. Market participants are watching for a confirmed hold at key support to validate the continuation of the rally. Key technical points Support Zone Confluence: Price is testing support at the value area high, aligning with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement and VWAP — a strong bullish confluence. Bullish Market Structure: Higher highs and higher lows continue to define the uptrend; current pullback is seen as a constructive retest. Volume Profile Insights: A recent volume climax may signal a local top, but continuation above resistance will require fresh volume influx. PEPEUSDT (4H) Chart | Source: TradingView Following the rejection at local resistance, PEPE has pulled back into a high-probability demand zone. This area — defined by the value area high, the 0.618 Fibonacci level, and the VWAP — is acting as a dynamic support zone. These overlapping indicators make it a prime location for bulls to defend and re-establish momentum. From a structural standpoint, PEPE is maintaining a clear pattern of higher highs and higher lows. The recent correction does not invalidate the bullish trend but instead provides a reset within it. As long as the higher low structure remains intact and price closes above the current support zone on the 4-hour chart, further upside looks increasingly probable. You might also like: Bitcoin price dips into support – bullish market structure signals push toward $125K Volume also plays a pivotal role here. While a recent volume climax hinted at short-term exhaustion, it does not signal a long-term reversal. Rather, it’s a marker of a local top. For PEPE to push higher and breach the current resistance, buyers will need to step in with conviction, marked by increased and sustained volume levels. What to expect in the coming price action If PEPE holds this key support zone, a move back toward local resistance becomes likely. A successful breakout, backed by volume, could trigger an expansion phase and new highs. Until the bullish structure is invalidated, dips like this continue to offer potential buying opportunities.

2025-05-23T18:10:58.000Z,"Bitcoin Accumulation: Whales and Retail Fuel Stunning Buying Spree","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Accumulation: Whales and Retail Fuel Stunning Buying Spree Are you watching the crypto market? If so, you’ve likely felt the growing buzz around Bitcoin. Something significant is happening, and it involves everyone from the smallest retail investor to the largest crypto whales. For the first time since January, Bitcoin accumulation has surged across all wallet sizes, indicating a strong, broad-based buying phase. What is Driving This Aggressive Bitcoin Accumulation? According to data analyzed by CoinDesk, Bitcoin (BTC) has entered a robust accumulation phase. This isn’t just a few big players buying; it’s a synchronized move across the entire spectrum of wallet holders. This widespread buying pressure is a key indicator often observed before significant price movements. One of the most compelling pieces of evidence comes from Glassnode’s Accumulation Trend Score. This metric tracks the proportion of market participants actively accumulating or distributing BTC on-chain. A score close to 1.0 indicates that a significant portion of the market is accumulating. Recently, this score hit a peak of 1.0, signaling aggressive buying activity by investors, regardless of how much BTC they hold. This renewed buying momentum didn’t just appear overnight. It began building in early May. Initially, the charge was led by the largest holders – the crypto whales , those with over 10,000 BTC. Their increased activity often signals confidence in future price appreciation. What makes this phase particularly noteworthy is that this whale accumulation was quickly followed by increased buying from smaller holders, indicating broad conviction across the market. Think of it like this: the biggest ships started sailing first, confident in the destination, and then the rest of the fleet followed, encouraged by the whales’ lead and the prevailing market winds. Beyond On-Chain: What Does the Options Market Say About the BTC Price? The bullish sentiment isn’t confined to on-chain data alone. The derivatives market, specifically Bitcoin options, is also flashing strong signals. Open interest in Bitcoin options has seen significant activity, particularly for contracts with ambitious strike prices. Let’s look at the numbers mentioned in the initial report: Approximately $620 million in call options expiring in June at the $300,000 strike price. Approximately $420 million in call options expiring in June at the $200,000 strike price. For those new to options, a call option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy an asset at a specific price (the strike price) by a certain date (the expiry). High open interest at strike prices significantly above the current BTC price suggests that a substantial number of traders are betting on a massive price increase in the near future (by June). While these targets might seem extremely optimistic, the sheer volume of money positioned on these bets reflects a powerful belief among a segment of market participants that Bitcoin has significant upward potential in the short to medium term. It’s a clear indicator of bullish expectation in the crypto market . Why is Broad Bitcoin Buying Important? When only whales are buying, it can sometimes indicate strategic positioning that might not immediately translate to sustained upward movement. However, when accumulation spreads across all investor sizes – from the smallest retail wallets to the largest institutional-sized holdings – it suggests widespread conviction. This broad participation can create a more robust and sustainable foundation for a price rally. Consider these points: Strength in Numbers: Aggregation of many small buys adds up significantly. Reduced Selling Pressure: Accumulation inherently means fewer people are selling at current prices. Market Confidence: It reflects growing confidence across diverse market segments. This pattern of aggressive Bitcoin buying across the board is a powerful signal that market participants are positioning themselves for potential future gains, seeing current prices as attractive entry or accumulation points. What Could This Mean for the Crypto Market Going Forward? Historically, periods of strong, broad accumulation have often preceded significant price rallies for Bitcoin. While past performance is not indicative of future results, the current data suggests a market structure that is becoming increasingly bullish. Potential Benefits: Increased likelihood of upward price momentum for BTC. Positive sentiment potentially spilling over to the broader crypto market . Validation of Bitcoin as a store of value or growth asset among diverse investor groups. Potential Challenges/Risks: Market volatility remains inherent in crypto. External macroeconomic factors or regulatory news could trigger sell-offs despite accumulation trends. The ambitious options targets ($200k, $300k) may not be reached, leading to potential price corrections if sentiment shifts. Actionable Insights (Not Financial Advice): Pay attention to on-chain metrics like the Accumulation Trend Score. Observe how different investor cohorts (especially crypto whales ) are behaving. Understand that while accumulation is bullish, market conditions can change rapidly. Do your own research (DYOR) before making any investment decisions based on these trends. This phase of aggressive Bitcoin accumulation , backed by strong signals from both on-chain data and the options market, paints a compelling picture of current market sentiment. It suggests that a wide range of investors are preparing for what they believe could be significant upward movement in the BTC price . Conclusion: A Unified Front in Bitcoin Buying The confluence of factors – the Glassnode Accumulation Trend Score hitting a perfect 1.0, the early lead by crypto whales followed by widespread retail participation, and the substantial options market positioning at high strike prices – points to a market that is not just hopeful, but actively positioning for a significant move. This broad-based Bitcoin buying suggests a collective confidence that hasn’t been seen across all cohorts since the start of the year. While the future is never certain, the current data presents a powerfully bullish case for Bitcoin in the near term, driven by a unified front of buyers across the entire market spectrum.

2025-05-23T18:07:00.000Z,"Price predictions 5/23: BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, ADA, SUI, HYPE, LINK","Key points: Bitcoin slipped below $109,588, but technical charts suggest traders are buying each dip. Excessive leverage in Bitcoin futures increases the risk of a quick correction. Select altcoins have turned down from their respective overhead resistance levels, signaling that the bears remain sellers on rallies. Sellers have pulled Bitcoin ( BTC ) back below the breakout level of $109,588, but lower levels are likely to attract buyers. Investor interest remains strong, with the US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds witnessing inflows of $934 million on May 22 and $608 million on May 21, according to SoSoValue data. Glassnode noted that the all-time high above $109,588 led to a total profit-taking volume of roughly $1 billion , far more muted than the $2 billion when the price rose above $100,000 in December. That shows the investors expect the up move to continue. Veteran trader Peter Brandt said in a post on X that Bitcoin was on target to hit between $125,000 and $150,000 by the end of August. Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360 A strong rally attracts speculators who load up on leverage. CoinGlass data shows that Bitcoin futures open interest rose to just over $80 billion on May 23. Excessive leverage increases the risk of forced liquidation when prices witness a sharp pullback. Therefore, traders should exercise caution. What are the critical support levels for Bitcoin and altcoins? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out. Bitcoin price prediction Sellers are trying to sustain the price below the breakout level of $109,588, which may trap the aggressive bulls. That could pull the price to the 20-day exponential moving average ($103,652). BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView A solid bounce off the 20-day EMA suggests that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. The bulls will then again attempt to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above $111,980. If they can pull it off, the BTC/USDT pair could dash toward the target objective of $130,000. The first sign of weakness will be a break below the 20-day EMA. That clears the path for a drop to the psychologically crucial level of $100,000. Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the $100,000 level because a break below it could sink the pair to the 50-day simple moving average ($94,001). Ether price prediction Ether ( ETH ) turned down from the $2,738 resistance, indicating that the bears are vigorously defending the level. ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The ETH/USDT pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($2,388), which is a vital support to keep an eye on. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, the bulls will again try to clear the $2,738 hurdle. If they do that, the pair could soar to $3,000. There is resistance at $2,850, but it is likely to be crossed. This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price continues to fall and breaks below the 20-day EMA. The pair could plunge to $2,323 and then to $2,111. XRP price prediction XRP ( XRP ) remains stuck inside the $2.65 to $2 range, indicating a balance between supply and demand. XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The 20-day EMA ($2.35) is flattening out, and the RSI is near the midpoint, suggesting that the XRP/USDT pair may extend its stay inside the range for a few more days. A break and close above $2.65 will complete a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, which has a target objective of $3.70. Alternatively, a break below the $2 level suggests that the bears have overpowered the bulls. That increases the likelihood of a drop to $1.60 and subsequently to $1.27. BNB price prediction BNB ( BNB ) turned down sharply from the $693 resistance on May 23, signaling aggressive selling by the bears. BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The BNB/USDT pair bounced off the 20-day EMA ($647), as seen from the long tail on the candlestick. That shows solid buying at lower levels. The bulls will again try to thrust the price above $693. If they manage to do that, the pair could skyrocket to the $732 to $761 resistance zone. Instead, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bulls are booking profits. The pair may then plummet to the 50-day SMA ($612). Solana price prediction Solana ( SOL ) climbed above the $180 resistance on May 23, but the bears are posing a strong challenge at $185. SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The upsloping 20-day EMA ($167) and the RSI in the positive zone indicate the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers sustain the price above $185, the SOL/USDT pair could rally to $210 and later to $220. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bulls are rushing to the exit. That heightens the risk of a drop to the 50-day SMA ($147). Dogecoin price prediction Dogecoin ( DOGE ) turned down from the $0.26 overhead resistance on May 23, indicating that the bears are fiercely defending the level. DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The DOGE/USDT pair could descend to the 20-day EMA ($0.21), which is an important support to watch out for. A solid bounce off the 20-day EMA signals a positive sentiment, improving the prospect of a break above $0.26. If that happens, the pair could rally to $0.35. There is resistance at $0.29, but it is likely to be crossed. This optimistic view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below $0.21. That suggests a possible range-bound action between $0.14 and $0.26. Cardano price prediction Cardano ( ADA ) bounced off the neckline of the inverse H&S pattern, but the bulls could not clear the overhead obstacle at $0.86. ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView If the price continues lower and breaks below the neckline, it shows that the bears are active at higher levels. The ADA/USDT pair could drop to the 50-day SMA ($0.69) and later to the solid support at $0.60. Contrarily, a solid bounce off the 20-day EMA ($0.75) shows demand at lower levels. The bulls will then again attempt to kick the price above $0.86. If they succeed, the pair could ascend to $1.01. Related: Bitcoin's new all-time high has traders asking: Is BTC price overheating at $111K? Sui price prediction Buyers failed to push Sui ( SUI ) above the overhead resistance of $4.25 on May 22, indicating that the bears are aggressively defending the level. SUI/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Repeated failure to cross the $4.25 level may have tempted short-term buyers to book profits. That pulled the price below the 20-day EMA ($3.73). If the price sustains below the 20-day EMA, the SUI/USDT pair could plummet to the 50-day SMA ($3.09). On the contrary, if the price turns up from the 20-day EMA and breaks above $4.25, it indicates the resumption of the up move. The pair could climb to $5 and eventually to $5.37, where the bears are expected to step in. Hyperliquid price prediction Hyperliquid (HYPE) soared above the stiff overhead resistance of $28.50 on May 22, indicating the start of the next leg of the up move. HYPE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The bulls pushed the price above the $35.73 resistance on May 23, but the long wick on the candlestick shows the bears are trying to defend the level. If buyers do not cede much ground to the bears, the HYPE/USDT pair could surge to $42.25. Time is running out for the bears. If they want to make a comeback, they will have to swiftly drag the price back below the 20-day EMA ($26.32). That signals the pair has formed a local top near $37.59. Chainlink price prediction Chainlink ( LINK ) closed above the resistance line of the descending channel pattern on May 22, but the bulls are finding it difficult to maintain the momentum. LINK/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The bears are trying to pull the price back into the descending channel. If the price skids below the neckline, it suggests that the breakout above the resistance line may have been a bull trap. The LINK/USDT pair could sink to $13.20, keeping the price stuck inside the channel for some more time. Conversely, a solid bounce off the resistance line indicates that the bulls are trying to flip the level into support. The pair could rise to $18 and thereafter to $19.80.

2025-05-23T18:05:52.000Z,"Analyst Says Full-Blown Altseason Has Started, Outlines Path Forward for Dogecoin, Floki and Pepe","An analyst known for making timely crypto calls believes that altcoins may have now entered a massive uptrend after Bitcoin ( BTC ) hit new all-time highs this week. Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 306,000 followers on the social media platform X that altcoins may start outperforming Bitcoin as the digital assets are suddenly flashing bullish. “Looking increasingly like a full-blown altseason has started. Trying not to get too ahead of myself, but all signs are pointing that way for now.” Looking at Dogecoin ( DOGE ), the analyst says the top memecoin is on the verge of printing a massive breakout rally, also known as a god candle. “These Dalai Lama upwards channel breakouts are always my favorite setups. God candle loading on DOGE.” Source: Bluntz/X DOGE is trading for $0.23 at time of writing, down 1.9% in the last 24 hours. Next up, the analyst says that the memecoin Floki ( FLOKI ) may be in the middle of printing a five-wave pattern to the upside. The analyst regularly applies the Elliott Wave theory in his technical analysis, which states that the main trend of the price of an asset moves in a five-wave pattern while a correction occurs in a three-wave pattern. “FLOKI looking increasingly like it’s going to extend further. A lot of these alts that looked like five up look to be extending here in my opinion. Altseason increasingly looking like it’s in full play.” Source: Bluntz/X Looking at his chart, the analyst suggests FLOKI may reach the $0.0001800 level. FLOKI is trading for $0.0001086 at time of writing, down 2.8% in the last 24 hours. Lastly, the analyst says that memecoin Pepe ( PEPE ) may soon soar to $0.00002500, a more than 65% increase from its current value, based on the Elliott Wave theory. “PEPE gearing up to extend quite a bit higher in my opinion. Nice series of one-twos formed down the bottom and still has a few more major legs to go before this can be viewed as five up complete in my opinion.” Source: Bluntz/X PEPE is trading for $0.00001497 at time of writing, up 3.1% in the last 24 hours.

By 2028, DOG•GO•TO•THE•MOON could reach a maximum price of $0.032. In 2031, we expect DOG’s price to record a maximum price of $0.066. DOG•GO•TO•THE•MOON, commonly known as DOG, is a cryptocurrency launched on April 24, 2024, using the Runes protocol. Known for its quick popularity, DOG quickly became the most popular token on the Runes platform. DOG’s quick rise can be traced back to an effective airdrop campaign. On its first day, the developers distributed 100 billion DOG tokens to over 75,000 owners of Runestone Ordinal NFTs.

2025-05-23T18:00:51.000Z,"Ethereum Surges With Force As Price Logs Most Significant Daily Rally In Years","Since the past few days, Ethereum price action has been nothing but quite stunning after breaking past the key $2,400 resistance level that previously hampered upside attempts. ETH’s breaking past this level has provided some sort of stability to the current upward trend as the altcoin continues to record significant gains. A Historic Ethereum Daily Price Surge With the broader crypto market recovering strongly, Ethereum seems to have found its footing alongside other major digital assets. Considering its recent move, seasoned market expert and host of the Crypto Banter show, Kyle Doops, claims that Ethereum has jolted back to life, indicating a resurgence of a bull market trend. Kyle Doops made the assertion due to ETH’s remarkable performance on Thursday, pushing past the crucial $2,600 barrier range. This notable move is attributed to the renewed investors’ interest in altcoins in light of shifting market dynamics. According to the market expert, the altcoin has pulled an over 50% price increase from the $1,800 mark to $2,700 after trailing the entire cycle. ETH’s growth within this price range was mainly bolstered by the recent integration of the Ethereum Pectra Upgrade , which was launched on May 7. The Pectra Upgrade is a key update in the Ethereum network consisting of two major aspects meant to enhance scalability and efficiency. Furthermore, the upgrade marks the blockchain’s most significant change made to the network since the Merge was launched in 2022. After navigating the ETH Daily Price Performance metric, Kyle Doops revealed that the altcoin recorded more than a 21.8% rise in under 24 hours. It is worth noting that this sharp move is the biggest daily gain Ethereum has experienced since May 2021. Given the robust bullish sentiment in the crypto market, the expert is confident that Ethereum might be waking up from its prolonged slumber, suggesting the potential beginning of a new bull phase for the crypto giant. ETH’s Active Addresses Count On The Rise Ted Pillows, a crypto enthusiast and investor, asserted that ETH is waking up, with its eyes set on reclaiming the $2,664 once again. Pillows is confident about ETH’s short-term performance as the weekly active addresses on the Ethereum network increase sharply, suggesting that upside momentum is building. Data shows that the number of weekly active addresses has risen to 15.65 million. Specifically, this growth in active wallets reflects investors’ strong adoption and conviction in the network, which could set the stage for a more sustainable increase in ETH’s price. Pillows remain extremely bullish in Ethereum’s future action, stating in a previous X post that a huge rally to the “$6,000 milestone isn’t a question of if, but when.” His prediction is due to the fact that ETH has not looked back since its deflationary shift in September 2022, and the next rally may just be “the most hated one ever.”",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-surges-with-force/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Ethereum|Crypto Banter Show|ETH|ETH Daily Price Performance Metric|ETH news|ETH Price|Ethereum Active Addresses|Ethereum network|ethereum news|Ethereum Pectra Upgrade|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT|Kyle Doops|Ted Pillows",cryptocompare
2025-05-23T20:00:00.000Z,"Crypto Biz: From shorting the Venezuelan Bolivar to shorting the US dollar","When Venezuela was experiencing hyperinflation, Ledn co-founder Mauricio di Bartolomeo hedged against the collapsing local currency by shorting it in favor of the more stable US dollar. Today, he’s using a similar strategy — this time borrowing against his Bitcoin (BTC) to hedge against the crumbling US dollar.Di Bartolomeo connected with me during Canada Crypto Week in Toronto, where he talked about the advantages of Bitcoin-backed loans and the rapid growth of collateralized BTC lending. In our interview, he made a compelling case for continuing to stack sats, even as Bitcoin’s price keeps rising.This week’s Crypto Biz dives into our conversation with the Ledn co-founder and covers the latest business news from the blockchain world.A lesson from hyperinflationBefore Bitcoin, di Bartolomeo’s most successful investment was shorting the Bolivar with US dollars, referring to his experience in Venezuela during the hyperinflationary 2010s. “I was borrowing Bolivars and buying dollars with them, holding the hard dollars and having a borrow [position] on the weaker currency,” he said.He then founded Ledn, a company that lets Bitcoin investors access dollar liquidity without parting ways with their BTC. By borrowing against Bitcoin, “you’re basically doing the same thing, but you are in effect holding the hard money, which is Bitcoin, and taking a borrow [position] on dollars, which is a weaker currency,” he said.Many Bitcoiners have found this to be a winning strategy. By the end of Q4, Ledn’s loan book value was valued at $9.9 billion, according to Galaxy Research.Cointelegraph’s Sam Bourgi and Ledn’s Mauricio di Bartolomeo.Guatemala’s largest bank integrates “invisible” crypto infrastructureBanco Industrial, Guatemala’s largest bank, has integrated crypto infrastructure SukuPay into its mobile banking app, enabling users to receive US dollars more easily.SukuPay said this integration is the first time a major Latin American retail bank has used a crypto-native protocol for its payment services.Banco Industrial has more than 1,600 service locations across Guatemala and has also expanded into neighboring countries. The “key to mainstream adoption of blockchain technology is making it invisible to the end-user,” SukuPay CEO Yonathan Lapchik told Cointelegraph. With SukuPay’s technology, Banco Industrial app users can receive dollars from the US for a flat fee of $0.99, significantly lower than the typical 6% to 10% they currently pay, said Lapchik.Bankers are panicking about stablecoins, NYU professor claimsAmerica’s banking lobby sees yield-bearing stablecoins as a threat to its business model, which relies on taking deposits, paying depositors minimal interest and using those funds for higher-risk investments, according to NYU professor Austin Campbell.In a May 21 social media post, Campbell claimed that he’s heard rumblings of “panic” over new stablecoins offering holders interest payments and other monetary rewards. He told Democratic lawmakers that “banks want you to protect their cartel so they can keep screwing your voters.”Although Campbell didn’t mention any stablecoin assets by name, Cointelegraph reported in February that the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the country’s first yield-bearing stablecoin security by Figure Markets. At the time of its launch, the YLDS stablecoin offered a yield of 3.85%.Pi Protocol and Spark Protocol have also developed interest-bearing tokens. Source: Austin CampbellStrategy continues to stack satsWith Bitcoin back above $100,000, Michael Saylor’s business intelligence firm, Strategy, has resumed its buying spree by acquiring 7,390 BTC last week for approximately $765 million.The latest purchase brings Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 576,230 BTC, with an unrealized gain of around $20 billion.The announcement came just two days before Bitcoin surged past its previous all-time high, climbing above $109,000 for the first time since January.

Bloomberg reported that a majority of the attendees at the memecoin dinner were likely foreign nationals based on their connections to crypto exchanges. “US law prohibits foreign persons from contributing to US political campaigns,” said the letter. “However, the $TRUMP memecoin, including the promotion of a dinner promising exclusive access to the President, opens the door for foreign governments to buy influence with the President, all without disclosing their identities.”May 22 letter to DOJ official calling for investigation into Trump memecoin dinner.

Members of the Senate will also propose an amendment to the GENIUS Act to address Trump’s connection to World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform backed by the president’s family that issued its USD1 stablecoin.Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/house-investigation-donald-trump-memecoin-dinner?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

This follows a sharp rebound in Bitcoin’s price, pushing past the STH cost-basis of $93,000. The profit-taking peaked at $747 million daily, a rapid increase from the $1.2 billion realized in the last 30-day period, highlighting a shift in new investor sentiment. Bitcoin entity-adjusted short-term holder. Source: GlassnodeThe STH Realized Profit/Loss Ratio has spiked, with profits now significantly outweighing losses, and only 8% of trading days have seen this ratio at a higher level.This level of profit-taking is typical during bullish trends but often precedes local market tops. Excessive profit-taking can overwhelm new demand, creating overhead supply resistance and halt Bitcoin’s upward trajectory. Crypto analyst Axel Adler Jr noted that Bitcoin’s 30-day price momentum has already slowed by 38%, currently sitting at 19%. Adler described it as a “technical cooldown” after the recent peak. The Bitcoin researcher suggested the market needs a “breather” before potentially resuming its rally.Similarly, analysis from Hyblock Capital advised caution as the previous three months outlined Bitcoin consistently targeting short liquidity zones above current prices, driving its recent highs. However, retail sentiment is at a 90-day low, with only 31.59% of retail accounts holding long positions.

That could pull the price to the 20-day exponential moving average ($103,652).BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewA solid bounce off the 20-day EMA suggests that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. The bulls will then again attempt to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above $111,980. If they can pull it off, the BTC/USDT pair could dash toward the target objective of $130,000.The first sign of weakness will be a break below the 20-day EMA. That clears the path for a drop to the psychologically crucial level of $100,000. Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the $100,000 level because a break below it could sink the pair to the 50-day simple moving average ($94,001).Ether price predictionEther (ETH) turned down from the $2,738 resistance, indicating that the bears are vigorously defending the level.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe ETH/USDT pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($2,388), which is a vital support to keep an eye on. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, the bulls will again try to clear the $2,738 hurdle. If they do that, the pair could soar to $3,000. There is resistance at $2,850, but it is likely to be crossed.This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price continues to fall and breaks below the 20-day EMA.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe 20-day EMA ($2.35) is flattening out, and the RSI is near the midpoint, suggesting that the XRP/USDT pair may extend its stay inside the range for a few more days.A break and close above $2.65 will complete a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, which has a target objective of $3.70. Alternatively, a break below the $2 level suggests that the bears have overpowered the bulls. That increases the likelihood of a drop to $1.60 and subsequently to $1.27.BNB price predictionBNB (BNB) turned down sharply from the $693 resistance on May 23, signaling aggressive selling by the bears.BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe BNB/USDT pair bounced off the 20-day EMA ($647), as seen from the long tail on the candlestick. That shows solid buying at lower levels. The bulls will again try to thrust the price above $693. If they manage to do that, the pair could skyrocket to the $732 to $761 resistance zone.Instead, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bulls are booking profits. The pair may then plummet to the 50-day SMA ($612).Solana price predictionSolana (SOL) climbed above the $180 resistance on May 23, but the bears are posing a strong challenge at $185.SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping 20-day EMA ($167) and the RSI in the positive zone indicate the path of least resistance is to the upside.

2025-05-23T17:58:20.000Z,"‘In ‘93, it became clear to me AI should be decentralized’ — Ben Goertzel","It’s been 30 years since computer scientist Ben Goertzel wrote his first line of AI code, already convinced that artificial intelligence should be decentralized. Today, as the world approaches the dawn of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), who leads this breakthrough could have profound consequences for the future of humanity.Speaking with Cointelegraph at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada, Goertzel said, “We’re likely to be able to launch AGI that can think and generalize beyond its training and programming within the next one to three years.”His project, SingularityNET, is a decentralized ecosystem building a global marketplace for AI services. Along the way, it has secured partnerships with Mind Network and Filecoin Foundation, invested $53 million in a modular supercomputer dedicated to decentralized AGI, and completed a token merger with Ocean Protocol and Fetch.ai to unify efforts in decentralized AI development.In 2024, Goertzel founded the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, the world’s largest open-source initiative dedicated to decentralized AGI.SingularityNET and the ASI Alliance are “probably the only serious AGI R&D team outside of Big Tech, certainly the only one in the crypto space, and I don't mean any slight against others doing cool AI stuff in the crypto space,” Goertzel said. For Goertzel, these milestones represent a return to first principles. After decades spent developing AI and championing decentralization, the broader tech world is finally catching up, turning once-radical ideas into drivers of multi-trillion-dollar industries. Goertzel and Sam Bourgi at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada. Source: CointelegraphThe substance behind decentralization“In ’93, ’94, ’95, it became clear to me AI should be decentralized,” Goertzel said.He wrote his first decentralized AI code the following year using a beta version of Java, then founded his first AI company in New York in 1997.At the time, the internet Goertzel was working with was itself decentralized, so it seemed only natural that AI should be, too.“What I didn’t foresee then was that the internet would become so centralized, actually, because at that point the internet really was decentralized,” he said.The internet’s subsequent evolution watered down the foundation of decentralization. “Later on, what happened is, you have Google, you have Facebook, you have Tencent — you have these companies making huge centralized mirrors of the internet on these massive data centers,” he said. However, for the next leap into AGI, Goertzel sees decentralization as a foundational safeguard against the monopolization and misuse of the technology. That principle is embedded in the architecture of SingularityNET, Hyperon, and the upcoming ASI Chain, a modular blockchain designed for decentralized AI.His argument is that AGI must be decentralized from the ground up, not adopted later, if it is to benefit humanity rather than serve concentrated power.“The way the post-AGI period goes may be quite different depending on whether the decentralized ecosystem plays a role in it or not,” he said, adding:“We are hoping that we, in collaboration with other decentralized teams, will be the first or among the very first to make it happen.”Goertzel’s ideas on AI and decentralization gained broader mainstream attention after his appearance on episode 1211 of the Joe Rogan Experience: Source: PowerfulJRERelated: The next frontier for crypto will be decentralizing AIA brief foray into decentralized moneyPerhaps due to his anarchist leanings and desire to “make anarchism real in cyberspace,” Goertzel explored the idea of decentralized money back in the 90s.As interesting as it sounded back then, Goertzel and his friends concluded that transaction times would be too slow and expensive, rendering the idea impractical.Just a few decades later, a person or entity named Satoshi Nakamoto created the first successful implementation of decentralized money known as Bitcoin (BTC). Ironically, its transactions are still slow and expensive — perhaps by design or due to its growing popularity — so Goertzel’s early skepticism wasn’t entirely misplaced. He also admitted that, at the time, he and his friends simply “weren’t good enough at business to hit on the idea of money laundering, selling drugs and guns online and so forth as a business model.” He was perhaps half-joking in a nod to the darknet marketplace Silk Road, which enabled anonymous transactions using Bitcoin until it was seized by authorities in 2013.Magazine: Advanced AI system is already ‘self-aware’ — ASI Alliance founder",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ben-goertzel-ai-decentralization-interview?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: Fidelity Digital AssetsFidelity’s senior research analyst Daniel Gray emphasized Bitcoin’s network resilience, noting a 50% surge in hashrate since the halving. This increase signals strong miner commitment despite reduced rewards. Unlike previous cycles marked by post-halving rallies, the 2024–2025 phase has been characterized by steadier, more measured growth. The Puell Multiple—an indicator of miner revenue relative to Bitcoin’s price—has stabilized, suggesting that the market is adjusting to lower issuance without significant volatility. The report explains, “Bitcoin’s more muted returns likely reflect a market that is digesting several extrinsic tailwinds and headwinds, which have inevitably caused some uncertainty.”Historically, this mid-epoch phase has coincided with new all-time highs—an event that occurred this week. Fidelity noted that this growth could extend into Q2 2025, potentially redefining Bitcoin’s position as a credible asset class in modern portfolios.Bitcoin's Realized Cap is a significant indicator of this evolution, which measures cumulative net capital inflows. Since the 2024 halving, the Realized Cap metric has surged 63%, climbing to $915 billion from $561 billion, underscoring the scale of capital entering the market.Bitcoin realized cap milestones. Source: GlassnodeThis trend fits within Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory, where Realized Cap has risen with each halving, indicating a maturing asset with substantial growth progression.Key drivers behind this Bitcoin bull marketThe current bull market cycle is also distinguished by record-breaking levels of institutional investor and corporate-level participation. The approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US in January 2024 has ushered in $134 billion in inflows, while monthly trading volumes on platforms like Binance soared past $1 trillion in March 2024—a massive leap from just $11 billion in January 2018.Public companies' strategic accumulation of Bitcoin, most notably Strategy, now holding 576,230 BTC, also sets a new industry blueprint. Firms like Metaplanet Inc., Bitcoin Group SE, and Semler Scientific have since followed suit, validating Bitcoin’s role as a corporate treasury asset this cycle.Thus, Gray asserts that Bitcoin’s fundamentals and global recognition are “stronger than ever,” signaling a cycle of growth, institutional anchoring, and market resilience.Related: Bitcoin's new all-time high has traders asking: Is BTC price overheating at $111K?This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-23T15:00:00.000Z,"Spoiler alert: The future of Web3 is not blockchain","Opinion by: Grigore Roșu, founder and chief executive officer of Pi SquaredFor some, the audacity of questioning the primacy of blockchain in Web3 is borderline heretical. The idea that decentralization and progress could exist without blockchains seems absurd to those who built careers around Bitcoin, Ethereum, and their descendants. Given blockchain's well-documented scaling limits, however, there is an argument to be made that Web3 doesn't actually need blockchains to thrive. Instead, it requires payment systems and verifiable settlement systems that are super fast. Blockchains are just one way to achieve that, not the only way.While blockchain solved the double-spending problem, it introduced its own architectural burden: the rigid fixation on total ordering, dictating that every transaction must wait its turn in a global queue, processed through a monolithic consensus mechanism. Initially, this made sense in the context of payments, where security and simplicity were paramount. Still, in the context of Web3, where complex applications require speed, flexibility, and scale, this same mechanism has become a constraint. It imposes a kind of serialized tyranny, throttling throughput and locking developers into a narrow lane of design options. The undeniable influence of FastPayMobile remittance app FastPay proved that double-spending can be avoided differently without a total order. This inspired systems like Linera, which use independent local orderings while maintaining global verifiability, proving that a different, more scalable future is possible and already underway. FastPay also inspired the likes of POD and Sui's single-owner objects protocol. If FastPay had been invented before Bitcoin, blockchain might never have captured the cultural or technical imagination in the way that it did.Recent: Beijing to invest in blockchain, integrate into infrastructureSome will no doubt argue that total ordering is essential for financial integrity or that without blockchains, decentralization itself unravels. These concerns, however, mistake a particular implementation of trustlessness for trustlessness itself. What truly underpins decentralized systems is the verifiability of a transaction, not the precise order in which it happened relative to every other global transaction. Blockchain's growing pains are still on displayWhile Ethereum's Dencun upgrade sought to improve transaction throughput through \""blobs,\"" the core architecture remains tied to total ordering. Even with Solana's introduction of the Lattice system, the network continues to suffer outages caused by bugs and excessive load. Additionally, the explosion of L2s is more a workaround than a solution, offloading transactions from mainnets only to reintroduce them later in delayed batches, resulting in an endless cycle of what is essentially congestion management.The rise of flexible payment and settlement protocolsLike in legacy tech circles, the “evolve or die” mantra certainly applies to investors and builders anchored to traditional blockchain architectures. Moving forward, protocols prioritizing flexible, verifiable payment systems and settlement over rigid total ordering will unlock far greater throughput and better user experiences. As decentralized applications evolve and autonomous agents driven by AI begin interacting with blockchains, the cost of sequencing everything in order will become a competitive liability.There have already been signs of this tectonic shift taking place, with the growing adoption of modular blockchain frameworks like Celestia underscoring a broader recognition that classical blockchains are too inflexible. Data availability layers, execution shards and offchain verification mechanisms are all attempts to decouple blockchain's trusted validation from its limiting sequencing model. While these efforts may not break entirely from the past, they point unmistakably toward a future of more adaptable infrastructure.A new role for blockchainThis doesn't mean blockchain will disappear, but it must evolve. Looking ahead, its most enduring role may be as a universal verifier, less a master ledger and more of a decentralized notary within a broader, more agile stack. While this is a necessary evolution, unfortunately, it's hard to see how that shift will be smooth, as too much capital, ideology and career risk is tied up in the legacy narrative. Many venture funds, DeFi protocols, and \""Ethereum killers\"" are financially and reputationally invested in keeping the blockchain central. But history has little mercy for technological incumbents that cling to yesterday's model. Just as the internet outgrew its early walled gardens, Web3 is poised to move beyond the rigidity of block-based sequencing. The fruits from the next wave of infrastructure will belong to those who understand and capitalize on this inflection point. Opinion by: Grigore Roșu, founder and chief executive officer of Pi Squared.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Last year, he faced a lawsuit brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission over the alleged “orchestration of the unregistered offer and sale, manipulative trading, and unlawful touting of crypto asset securities.”The SEC asked for a reprieve in late February, just over a month since Trump’s inauguration and the subsequent 180 in federal agencies’ approach toward regulating crypto. Outside the crypto dinner, Sun posted on May 21 that he would be spending a week in Washington, DC to have “meaningful conversations that will help shape the next chapter of blockchain’s future” in the United States.Kain WarwickKain Warwick, founder of crypto exchange operator iFinex, told The New York Times on May 12 that he was attending the event after stocking up on enough TRUMP to break the top 25 investors on the leaderboard. Warwick said he wanted to have a shot at meeting the president, or someone on his team, to talk crypto — specifically decentralized finance (DeFi), which is getting less attention in the current crop of crypto bills circulating the US Congress.“If you assume Trump and 10 people within the Trump team are there, now you’ve got a one in 15 shot of having a conversation with one of them,” he said.Vincent LiuVincent Liu, chief investment officer of crypto trading, VC and market-making firm Kronos Research, attended the event, posting pictures of the menu and Trump’s brief speech.A photo of the menu at Donald Trump’s memecoin dinner.

Their company’s chief business development officer, Cherry Hsu, told Sherwood News that Trump’s rise “represents the power of memes to influence culture, perception, and movements — principles that align with MemeCore’s vision of a decentralized, community-driven future.”“Ogle,” a cybersecurity adviser to Trump’s own World Liberty Financial crypto enterprise, as well as the pseudonymous co-founder of blockchain ecosystem Glue, also attended. Ogle said they were going out of curiosity, more than anything, and did not endorse Trump personally. “I’m hoping it’ll be fun — and hoping they’ll serve McDonald’s.”Another anonymous attendee was “Cryptoo Bear,” a crypto trader and occasional news reporter who posts primarily in Japanese. Cryptoo Bear made no political statements about the event, mainly posting about the swag and the food.

Critics of the event widely consider it to be a glaring example of corruption in Washington and within the Trump administration. Senator Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, joined the protest. “The spirit of the Constitution was that no one elected would be selling influence to anyone,” he said, “because it’s to be government by and for the people.”Ken Papaj, a former Treasury Department official, said, “Every time there’s a transaction, he gets a transaction fee? Just unconscionable what he’s doing.”The dinner comes at a pivotal time for the crypto industry in the US, where the industry is pushing hard for Congress to pass friendly regulations. Trump’s ties may complicate matters, however, as lawmakers have introduced anti-corruption bills targeting crypto and politicians.Senate Democrats are also taking aim at the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act, introducing a slew of amendments addressing Trump’s crypto businesses. Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/who-attended-trumps-controversial-memecoin-dinner?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-23T14:20:00.000Z,"What is DNS hijacking? How it took down Curve Finance’s website","Understanding the Curve Finance DNS hijacking              On May 12, 2025, at 20:55 UTC, hackers hijacked the “.fi” domain name system (DNS) of Curve Finance after managing to access the registrar. They began sending its users to a malicious website, attempting to drain their wallets. This was the second attack on Curve Finance’s infrastructure in a week.Users were directed to a website that was a non-functional decoy, designed only to trick users into providing wallet signatures. The hack hadn’t breached the protocol’s smart contracts and was limited to the DNS layer.The DNS is a critical component of the internet that functions like a phonebook. It allows you to use simple, memorable domain names (such as facebook.com) instead of complex numerical IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1) for websites. DNS converts these user-friendly domain names into the IP addresses computers require to connect.This is not the first time Curve Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, has suffered such an attack. Back in August 2022, Curve Finance faced an attack with similar tactics. The attackers had cloned the Curve Finance website and interfered with its DNS settings to send users to a duplicate version of the website. Users who tried using the platform ended up losing their money to the attackers. The project was using the same registrar, “iwantmyname,” at the time of the previous attack.                  How attackers execute DNS hijacking in crypto              When a user types a web address, their device queries a DNS server to retrieve the corresponding IP address and connect to the correct website. In DNS hijacking, fraudsters interfere with this process by altering how DNS queries are resolved, rerouting users to malicious sites without their knowledge.Fraudsters execute DNS hijacking in several ways. Attackers might exploit vulnerabilities in DNS servers, compromise routers, or gain access to domain registrar accounts. The objective is to change the DNS records so that a user trying to visit a legitimate site is redirected to a fake, lookalike page containing wallet-draining code. Types of DNS hijacking include:Local DNS hijack: Malware on a user’s device changes DNS settings, redirecting traffic locally. Router hijack: Attackers compromise home or office routers to alter DNS for all connected devices. Man-in-the-middle attack: Intercepts DNS queries between user and server, altering responses on the fly. Registrar-level hijack: Attackers gain access to a domain registrar account and modify official DNS records, affecting all users globally.Did you know? During the Curve Finance DNS attack in 2023, users accessing the real domain unknowingly signed malicious transactions. The back end was untouched, but millions were lost through a spoofed front end.                  How DNS hijacking worked in the case of Curve Finance              When attackers compromise a website with DNS hijacking, they can reroute traffic to a malicious website without the user’s knowledge. There are several ways DNS hijacking can occur. Attackers might infect a user’s device with malware that alters local DNS settings, or they may gain control of a router and change its DNS configuration. They may also target DNS servers or domain registrars themselves. In such cases, they modify the DNS records at the source, affecting all users trying to access the site.In the case of Curve Finance, the attackers infiltrated the systems of the domain registrar “iwantmyname” and altered the DNS delegation of the “curve.fi” domain to redirect traffic to their own DNS server. A domain registrar is a company authorized to manage the reservation and registration of internet domain names. It allows individuals or organizations to claim ownership of a domain and link it to web services like hosting and email.The precise method of the breach is still under investigation. By May 22, 2025, no evidence of unauthorized access or compromised credentials was found.Did you know? DNS hijacking attacks often succeed by compromising domain registrar accounts through phishing or poor security. Many Web3 projects still host domains with centralized providers like GoDaddy or Namecheap.                   How Curve Finance responded to the hack              While the registrar was slow to respond, the Curve team took measures to deal with the situation. It successfully redirected the “.fi” domain to neutral nameservers, thus taking the website offline while efforts to regain control continued. To ensure safe access to the frontend and secure fund management, the Curve team quickly launched a secure alternative at “curve.finance,” now serving as the official Curve Finance interface temporarily.Upon discovering the exploit at 21:20 UTC, the following actions were taken: Users were immediately notified through official channelsRequested the takedown of the compromised domainInitiated mitigation and domain recovery processesCollaborated with security partners and the registrar to coordinate a response.Compromise of the domain notwithstanding, the Curve protocol and its smart contracts remained secure and fully operational. During the disruption of the front end, Curve processed over $400 million in onchain volume. No user data was at risk, as Curve’s front end does not store any user information.Throughout the compromise, the Curve team was always available through its Discord server, where users could raise issues with them.After implementing immediate damage control measures, the Curve team is now taking additional steps to prepare for the future.Assessing and enhancing registrar-level security, incorporating stronger protections and exploring alternative registrarsInvestigating decentralized front-end options to eliminate dependence on susceptible web infrastructurePartnering with the broader DeFi and Ethereum Name Service (ENS) communities to advocate for native browser support for “.eth” domains.Did you know? Unlike smart contract exploits, DNS hijacks leave no trace onchain initially, making it hard for users to realize they have been tricked until funds are gone. It is a stealthy form of crypto theft.                  How crypto projects can deal with DNS hijacking vulnerability              The Curve Finance attack is concerning because it bypassed the decentralized security mechanisms at the protocol level. Curve’s backend, meaning its smart contracts and onchain logic, remained unharmed, yet users lost funds because they were deceived at the interface level. This incident underscores a significant vulnerability in DeFi. While the backend may be decentralized and trustless, the front end still depends on centralized Web2 infrastructure like DNS, hosting and domain registrars. Attackers can exploit these centralized choke points to undermine trust and steal funds. The Curve attack serves as a wake-up call for the crypto industry to explore decentralized web infrastructure, such as InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Ethereum Name Service (ENS), to reduce reliance on vulnerable centralized services.To address the gap between decentralized backends and centralized frontends, crypto projects must adopt a multi-layered approach. Here are various ways crypto projects can deal with this gap:Minimize reliance on traditional DNS: They can minimize reliance on traditional DNS by integrating decentralized alternatives of DNS like the ENS or Handshake, which reduce the risk of registrar-level hijacks. Use decentralized file storage systems: Hosting frontends on decentralized file storage systems such as IPFS or Arweave adds another layer of protection.Implement domain name system security extensions (DNSSEC): Teams should implement DNSSEC to verify the integrity of DNS records and prevent unauthorized changes. Secure registrar accounts: Registrar accounts must be secured with strong authentication methods, including multifactor authentication (MFA) and domain locking. Train users: Educating users to verify site authenticity, such as bookmarking URLs or checking ENS records, can reduce phishing success rates. Bridging the trust gap between decentralized protocols and centralized interfaces is essential for maintaining security and user confidence in DeFi platforms.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-dns-hijacking-how-it-took-down-curve-finances-website?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Cetus’ recovery plan on Sui mirrors a Solana blueprint","The bounty offer to recover stolen funds from Sui-based decentralized exchange (DEX) Cetus closely resembles a successful strategy used by a Solana project three years ago.It turns out that Cetus shares the same development team as Crema Finance, a Solana-based DeFi project that suffered a $9-million hack in 2022 but recovered most of the funds by negotiating with its hacker. Now, Cetus is relying on the same strategy.Cetus is asking the hacker to return all but $6 million, or 2,324 Ether (ETH), of the stolen funds in exchange for a promise not to pursue legal action. The protocol lost $223 million to an exploit on May 22.The size of the bounty has sparked backlash from users, with many calling for a formal compensation plan instead. Several community members argue that even if funds are recovered, most of the damage has already been done — especially to holders of the CETUS token, which plummeted in value following the incident.Meanwhile, Sui validators are also under fire for their role in freezing the funds. The move is aimed at aiding recovery, yet critics say it exposes centralization risks in the network.CETUS immediately dropped around 35% following the hack.

The Solana project hasn’t posted on its X account since March 2023, and its trading platform now sees negligible volume, but it still didn’t end well for the hacker.Crema suffered an approximately $9-million hack in 2022.

Around $63 million had already been bridged to Ethereum before these controls were implemented.Although the coordinated effort has been effective in preventing the funds from being laundered, the cryptocurrency community has criticized Sui for being too centralized.“SUI’s validators are colluding to CENSOR the hacker’s TXs right now! Does that make SUI centralized? The short answer is YES; what matters more is why? The ‘founders’ own the majority of supply & there are only 114 validators!” Justin Bons, founder of Cyber Capital, wrote on X.Some users challenge Bons’ claim, arguing that decentralization doesn’t mean a free-for-all. Source: Squatch/Justin BonsAs Bons pointed out, Sui has just 114 validators — far fewer than its more established smart contract peers. Ethereum has over 1 million validators, while Solana has 1,157.Meanwhile, members of the Sui community defended the move, arguing that this is how real-world decentralized chains should function.“Decentralization isn’t about standing by while people get hurt, it’s about the power to act together, without needing permission,” said one member of the Sui community.Related: WLFI’s DeFi credentials under fire after Sui partnershipFollowing the hack, Sui developers committed code for a proposed function that would have allowed specific transactions to bypass all signing and safety checks by adding them to a whitelist. While the function could have been used to help recover stolen funds, it also raised concerns about centralized control and the erosion of decentralization. The code was ultimately not merged and is not live on the network.SUI’s price has also been damaged by the Cetus exploit. Source: CoinGeckoSui and Cetus backlash contrasts recent hacksThe Cetus exploit has spotlighted the persistent security challenges in DeFi while raising deeper questions around who holds the reins in supposedly decentralized networks like Sui.The team’s $6-million offer to the hacker mirrors the playbook it used with Crema — but this time, the crypto community isn’t as forgiving. With CETUS tanking, trust fractured and validators freezing funds, critics are asking whether Sui’s decentralization is more appearance than reality.The debate over decentralization isn’t unique to Sui. When Bybit lost $1.4 billion in a February hack linked to North Korean state actors, security experts and users urged platforms like THORChain and eXch to block the funds. In that case, THORChain received some backlash for not stepping in, which is the exact opposite of what Sui is being criticized for now.As of now, the hacker hasn’t accepted Cetus’ offer. Two Ethereum wallets tied to the exploiter still hold over $60 million in ETH, with no movement at the time of writing.

Meanwhile, across the Capitol, Representative Tom Emmer reintroduced the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, backed by bipartisan support.Breaking down GENIUSThe GENIUS Act — short for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act” — seeks to answer foundational questions around stablecoin issuance and oversight.“It defines this idea of a payment stablecoin,” explained Rashan Colbert, director of US policy at the Crypto Council for Innovation, in this week’s interview. Colbert emphasized that the bill doesn’t stop at definitions. “It outlines in a robust way just who’s allowed to do this and what they need to look like.” By this, he’s referring to guidelines on who can be permitted issuers like bank subsidiaries, credit unions and approved non-bank entities.Related: Interest groups, lawmakers to protest Trump’s memecoin dinnerThis bipartisan momentum seen backing the GENIUS Act is both exciting and significant. “There has been latent support within Congress, including within the Democratic caucus,” Colbert said. “They just haven’t had the opportunity to take meaningful votes.”Blockchain dev protectionOn the House side, the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, co-sponsored by Representatives Emmer and Ritchie Torres, aims to give legal clarity to developers and service providers who don’t custody customer funds.“It clarifies that they are not money transmitters,” said Colbert. “That’s the clarity these builders and entrepreneurs need to continue operating successfully.”With crypto adoption on the rise — particularly among minority communities — Colbert said the pressure is on. “Something like one in five Americans hold crypto. That number is even larger in the Black, Latino and Asian-American communities,” he noted.Looking ahead, the push toward broader market structure reform will be more complex. Colbert’s advice?

2025-05-23T13:00:00.000Z,"Ledn ditches ETH, shifts to full custody model for Bitcoin loans","Digital asset lender Ledn is transitioning to fully collateralized Bitcoin lending and discontinuing support for Ethereum, in moves designed to consolidate its BTC-focused business and further safeguard client assets against credit risks.In adopting a full custody structure for Bitcoin (BTC) loans, Ledn will no longer lend out client assets to generate interest, the company disclosed on May 23. Instead, Bitcoin collateral will remain under full custody by Ledn or one of its designated funding partners. “This means assets aren’t rehypothecated, reused, or loaned out to generate yield,” Ledn co-founder and CEO Adam Reeds told Cointelegraph. Reeds said the move brings the company back to its roots and aligns more closely with Bitcoin’s founding principles.“Bitcoin was created as a direct response to the risks of fractional reserve banking and unchecked use of client assets to generate interest,” said Reed, adding:“Traditional finance relies on constantly reusing client assets to create leverage and, ultimately, inflation. Bitcoiners instinctively reject that model. That’s why we’ve moved away from this approach entirely. Reed told Cointelegraph that the company is ending support for Ether (ETH) as “part of a broader strategic shift,” as Bitcoin represents over 99% of Ledn’s client activity. “Rather than fragmenting the platform to chase marginal volume, we’re going all-in on Bitcoin and simplifying our stack to reflect what our clients actually value,” said Reed.Founded in 2018, Ledn has emerged as one of the largest lenders in the digital asset space with a loan book value of $9.9 billion, according to Galaxy Research. The company enables Bitcoin holders to borrow against their assets, giving them access to liquidity without having to sell their holdings or trigger a taxable event.This approach is commonly used by wealthy investors, who take out low-interest loans against stocks, real estate, and other assets to access cash.Bitcoin’s price has reached new all-time highs above $111,000.

Trump’s sons — Eric and Donald Jr. —are involved in the management of the company.Zhao said the WSJ article portrayed him as acting as a “fixer” for the WLF team and its co-founder Zach Witkoff during foreign trips. The article suggested Zhao facilitated introductions and meetings for WLF leaders during foreign trips, including a visit to Pakistan that reportedly resulted in a memorandum of understanding with a local official.“I am not a fixer for anyone,” Zhao said, firmly denying that he connected Pakistani official “Mr. Saqib” with WLF or organized any engagements abroad. “They had known each other way back, whereas I only met with Mr. Saqib for the first time in Pakistan.” Source: Changpeng ZhaoWSJ reports on Steve and Zach WitkoffZhao’s response follows a WSJ investigation highlighting a complex string of diplomatic and business interests involving WLF. The report raised concerns about the blurred lines between public duties and private interests and focused on diplomatic and business dealings involving WLF co-founders Steve Witkoff and his son, Zach Witkoff.

Online banks, he said, spend about $20 to $30. In contrast, DeFi requires almost nothing beyond a smartphone and internet access.“Onboarding to DeFi literally costs zero,” Bukov said. “You don’t need brick-and-mortar infrastructure or lengthy verification processes. Just connect and transact.” Bukov said that this gives DeFi an edge over traditional financial institutions in reaching the 1.4 billion unbanked people who remain excluded from traditional finance due to high onboarding expenses.1inch Network co-founder Anton Bukov at the Dutch Blockchain Week. Source: CointelegraphReaching 1.4 billion unbanked users“That’s why we have 1.4 billion people on the planet who are unbanked. No one’s going to invest those hundreds or tens of dollars into them because they will never return to them,” Bukov added. Unlike traditional finance, which has high barriers to entry, Bukov said DeFi allows the unbanked to become a part of the global economy and engage in real-life transactions using stablecoins like Tether’s USDt (USDT). With lower barriers to entry, DeFi becomes a tool for financial inclusion. Bukov said DeFi will continue to reach users who never had access to traditional banking as internet access expands globally. “You can just get a phone, access to the internet, and you can exchange your chicken for USDT,” Bukov said, highlighting how easily DeFi enables participation in the global economy. Related: Animoca’s Yat Siu says student loans can supercharge DeFi growthDeFi allows access to global liquidity Apart from financial inclusion, Bukov said that the real value of crypto lies in how it gives access to global liquidity. The 1inch co-founder said crypto is evolving into an independent economic zone, where hundreds of billions flow through decentralized protocols. “Crypto isn’t just about adopting stablecoins or building national digital currencies,” Bukov said. “It’s a growing global liquidity hub.”He said that this liquidity is dynamic and allows financial experimentation, yield strategies and cross-border capital movement. Bukov added that countries that align their regulations to enable easier access to this global liquidity can tap into economic opportunities and cooperation. “The more countries trade with each other, the more they succeed.

2025-05-23T08:25:00.000Z,"Why Tether refuses to comply with MiCA","Is Tether MiCA compliant?              The EU’s new Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation, better known as MiCA, is the first major attempt by a global economic power to create clear, region-wide rules for the crypto space, and stablecoins are a big focus.MiCA mandates best practices. If a stablecoin is going to be traded in the EU, its issuer has to follow some stringent rules:1. You need a licenseTo issue a stablecoin in Europe, you must become a fully authorized electronic money institution (EMI). That’s the same kind of license traditional fintechs need to offer e-wallets or prepaid cards. It’s not cheap and it’s not quick. 2. Most of your reserves have to sit in European banksThis is one of the most controversial parts of MiCA. If you issue a “significant” stablecoin — and Tether’s USDT certainly qualifies — at least 60% of your reserves must be held in EU-based banks. The logic is to keep the financial system safe. 3. Full transparency is non-negotiableMiCA requires detailed, regular disclosures. Issuers have to publish a white paper and provide updates on their reserves, audits and operational changes. This level of reporting is new territory for some stablecoins, especially those that have historically avoided public scrutiny.4. Non-compliant coins are getting delistedIf a token doesn’t comply, it won’t be tradable on regulated EU platforms. Binance, for example, has delisted USDT trading pairs for users in the European Economic Area (EEA). Other exchanges are following suit.The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) clarified that people in Europe can still hold or transfer USDT, but it can’t be offered to the public or listed on official venues. In other words, you might still have USDT in your wallet, but good luck trying to swap it on a regulated platform.                  Key reasons why Tether rejects MiCA regulations              Tether is unique in that it has explained why it wants nothing to do with MiCA regulations. The company’s leadership, especially CEO Paolo Ardoino, has been pretty vocal about what they see as serious flaws in the regulation, from financial risks to privacy concerns to the bigger picture of who stablecoins are really for.1. The banking rule could backfireOne of MiCA’s most talked-about rules says that “significant” stablecoins — like Tether’s USDt (USDT) — must keep at least 60% of their reserves in European banks. The idea is to make stablecoins safer and more transparent. But Ardoino sees it differently.He’s warned that this could create new problems, forcing stablecoin issuers to rely so heavily on traditional banks could make the whole system more fragile. After all, if there’s a wave of redemptions and those banks don’t have enough liquidity to keep up, we’d witness a struggling bank and a stablecoin crisis simultaneously.Instead, Tether prefers to keep most of its reserves in US Treasurys, assets it says are liquid, low-risk and much easier to redeem quickly if needed.2. They don’t trust the digital euroTether also has a broader issue with the direction Europe is heading, especially regarding a digital euro. Ardoino has openly criticized it, raising alarms about privacy. He has argued that a centrally controlled digital currency could be used to track how people spend their money, and even control or restrict transactions if someone falls out of favor with the system.Privacy advocates have echoed similar concerns. While the European Central Bank insists that privacy is a top priority (with features like offline payments), Tether isn’t convinced. In their eyes, putting that much financial power in the hands of one institution is asking for trouble.3. Tether’s users aren’t in Brussels. They’re in Brazil, Turkey and NigeriaAt the heart of it, Tether sees itself as a lifeline for people in countries dealing with inflation, unstable banking systems and limited access to dollars. These are places like Turkey, Argentina and Nigeria, where USDT is often more useful than the local currency.MiCA, with all its licensing hoops and reserve mandates, would require Tether to shift focus and invest heavily in meeting EU-specific standards. That’s something the company says it’s not willing to do, not at the expense of the markets it sees as most in need of financial tools like USDT.Did you know? Turkey ranks among the top countries for cryptocurrency adoption, with 16% of its population engaged in crypto activities. This high adoption rate is largely driven by the devaluation of the Turkish lira and economic instability, prompting citizens to seek alternatives like stablecoins to preserve their purchasing power.                  What happens when Tether doesn’t comply with MiCA              Tether’s decision to skip MiCA didn’t exactly fly under the radar. It’s already having real consequences, especially for exchanges and users in Europe.Exchanges are dropping USDTBig names like Binance and Kraken didn’t wait around. To stay on the right side of EU regulators, they’ve already delisted USDT trading pairs for users in the European Economic Area. Binance had removed them by the end of March 2025. Kraken followed close behind, removing not just USDT but also other non-compliant stablecoins like EURT and PayPal’s PYUSD.Users are left with fewer optionsIf you’re in Europe and holding USDT, you’re not totally out of luck; you can still withdraw or swap it on certain platforms. But you won’t be trading it on major exchanges anymore. That’s already pushing users toward alternatives like USDC and EURC, which are fully MiCA-compliant and widely supported.Even major crypto payment processors are pulling support, leaving users with fewer options for spending their crypto directly.A hit to liquidity? Probably.Pulling USDT from European exchanges could make the markets a bit shakier. Less liquidity, wider spreads and more volatility during big price moves are all on the table. Some traders will adjust quickly. Others? Not so much.Did you know? Tether (USDT) is the most traded cryptocurrency globally, surpassing even Bitcoin in daily volume. In 2024, it facilitated over $20.6 trillion in transactions and boasts a user base exceeding 400 million worldwide.                  Tether vs MiCA regulation              Tether may be out of sync with the EU, but it’s far from retreating. If anything, the company is doubling down elsewhere, looking for friendlier ground and broader horizons.Firstly, Tether’s picked El Salvador as its new base, a country that has fully embraced crypto. After getting a digital asset service provider license, the company is setting up a real headquarters there. Ardoino and other top execs are making the move too.Moreover, after banking over $5 billion in profits in early 2024, Tether is putting its capital to work:AI: Through its venture arm, Tether Evo, the company has picked up stakes in firms like Northern Data Group and Blackrock Neurotech. Tether has also launched Tether AI, an open-source, decentralized AI platform designed to operate on any device without centralized servers or API keys. The goal is to use AI to boost operations and maybe build some new tools along the way.Infrastructure and AgTech: Tether invested in Adecoagro, a company focused on sustainable farming and renewable energy. It’s a surprising move, but it fits Tether’s bigger strategy of backing real-world, resilient systems.Media and beyond: There are also signs Tether wants a footprint in content and communications, signaling it’s thinking far beyond crypto alone.                  Tether’s MiCA exit highlights crypto’s global regulatory chaos              Tether walking away from MiCA is a snapshot of a much bigger issue in crypto: How hard it is to build a business in a world where every jurisdiction plays by its own rulebook.The classic game of regulatory arbitrageThis isn’t Tether’s first rodeo when it comes to navigating regulations. Like many crypto companies, they’ve mastered the art of regulatory arbitrage, finding the friendliest jurisdiction and setting up shop there. Europe brings in strict rules? Fine, Tether sets up in El Salvador, where crypto is welcomed with open arms.However, it does raise questions. If big players can simply move jurisdictions to dodge regulations, how effective are those rules in the first place? And does that leave retail users protected or just further confused?A crypto world that’s all over the mapThe bigger issue is that the global regulatory landscape is incredibly fragmented. Europe wants full compliance, transparency and reserve mandates. The US is still sending mixed signals. Asia is split; Hong Kong is pro-crypto, while China stays cold. Hong Kong has also passed the Stablecoin Bill to license fiat-backed issuers and boost its Web3 ambitions. Meanwhile, Latin America is embracing crypto as a tool for financial access.For companies, it’s a mess. You can’t build for one global market; you must constantly adapt, restructure or pull out entirely. For users, it creates massive gaps in access. A coin available in one country might be inaccessible in another just because of local policy.As a final thought: Tether’s resistance to MiCA seems to be more than just a protest against red tape. It’s making a bet that crypto’s future will be shaped outside Brussels, not inside it.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/why-tether-refuses-to-comply-with-mica?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

It’s an increase of 30% since the start of May as derivatives speculators load up on leverage in anticipation of higher Bitcoin prices.Open interest is the total number of outstanding futures contracts that allow traders to bet on the future price of Bitcoin, which have not been settled or closed, showing the total amount of current market speculation.Total Bitcoin futures OI.

2025-05-23T05:11:25.000Z,"Trendspotting in crypto: How to discover winning projects before the crowd","TL;DRSpotting the next big crypto project before it explodes demands data, discipline and a sharp eye for real signals. This guide explores how to identify early winners by analyzing onchain metrics, tokenomics, dev activity and community traction while avoiding the common traps of hype-driven pumps and red-flag projects.Despite the crypto space being crowded, fast-moving and full of noise, some investors manage to consistently find promising projects while they’re still under the radar.So, how do they do it? Crypto trendspotters know how to read onchain data. They understand tokenomics. They read GitHub commits and follow the money. It takes more than jumping on the hype bandwagon ahead of the crowd.This guide breaks down how to find crypto projects with real potential using lessons from past winners like Solana, Arbitrum, Chainlink and even memecoins like Pepe. Along the way, it will highlight the tools that matter, red flags to avoid and the difference between organic growth and manufactured buzz.How the real winners took offSolanaWhen Solana launched in 2020, few outside of developer circles had heard of it. But it had one big edge: speed. Solana’s proof-of-history tech made it one of the fastest chains around, and it quickly became a magnet for builders, especially in DeFi and NFTs. By 2021, its ecosystem exploded with apps like Serum and Magic Eden.Early adopters who paid attention to onchain growth — like wallet activity and DEX volume — could see something brewing. Solana (SOL) went from under $1 to $50+ in less than a year. Arbitrum Arbitrum launched in 2021 as an Ethereum layer 2, but its big moment came with the Arbitrum (ARB) token airdrop in March 2023. At launch, Arbitrum was already processing more transactions than many layer 1s and had billions in total value locked (TVL) in decentralized applications (DApps).Smart investors were watching. Even before the token, the signs were there: user activity, rising liquidity and growing app adoption. When ARB dropped, the pump stuck because the foundation was real.ChainlinkChainlink is a classic example of a project with long-term utility. It doesn’t have flashy branding or meme power, but it does one thing incredibly well: feed real-world data into smart contracts.By 2024, it had become the backbone of much of DeFi, gaming and even tokenized real-world assets. If you were watching closely in 2019-2020, you saw LINK (LINK) getting integrated everywhere. That kind of early utility often flies under the radar — until price action catches up.PEPE Coin (PEPE)Let’s not pretend memes don’t matter. Pepe (PEPE) launched in 2023 with no roadmap, no utility and no VC backing. But it hit a nerve, and the internet ran with it. The coin hit a billion-dollar market cap within weeks.That kind of run is rare — and risky. But for traders tracking social sentiment, wallet distribution and community activity, the early signals were all there. PEPE didn’t promise anything, but it delivered returns by becoming a viral moment.How to find crypto gems earlySo, how do you separate the next Solana from the next rug pull? Here’s how serious trendspotters approach it.1. Start with onchain metricsPublic blockchains are transparent. Use that to look at:Daily active walletsTransaction volumeTokenholder growthLiquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs)TVL (for DeFi projects).If users and capital are moving in — before the token moons — that’s a great sign. Tools like Dune Analytics, Nansen and DefiLlama are your best friends here.2. Understand the tokenomicsAsk questions like:What’s the total supply? How much is circulating?Are there upcoming unlocks or vesting cliffs?Who holds the tokens, and how concentrated are the top wallets?Is there utility? Does the token do anything?Tokens with capped supply, smart incentives (like staking or burn mechanisms) and fair distribution models tend to do better long-term.3. Check developer activityIs the team actually building?GitHub is a goldmine. Look at how often code is pushed, how many contributors are active, and whether the repo looks alive. No updates for months? Big red flag.You don’t need to read code — just track commits and releases. Projects with real traction are always shipping.4. Look for ecosystem signalsAre other developers building on top of it? Are DApps launching? Is liquidity growing? Are users coming back week after week?Ecosystem growth is hard to fake, and it’s often the strongest early indicator that a project has legs.5. Follow the communityX, Discord, Telegram, Reddit — yes, it’s noisy. But it’s also where trends start. Look beyond the price talk:Are people actually using the product?Are devs answering questions?Is the tone constructive or just hype?Use LunarCrush or Santiment to track social momentum, but always double-check it with onchain data.Key tools to spot crypto trendsHere’s a quick rundown of the top platforms used by smart crypto trendspotters:Top tip: Don’t just use one tool. Great traders cross-reference everything.Crypto trend analysis 2025A coin might be flying, but is it because people are actually using it or just talking about it? Learning to tell the difference can save you from making a bad investment. Signs of real tractionSteady user growth and TVL over time: If users are showing up before a token pumps — and the numbers keep climbing week over week — that’s usually a sign of substance. You’ll often see this in DeFi protocols or layer 2s gaining trust slowly, not overnight.Code commits and product updates: A live GitHub with regular commits, active devs and visible progress means the team is building. This shows momentum and long-term focus — not just a marketing push.More tokenholders, less whale control: When new holders join steadily — and supply isn’t all locked up by the top five wallets — it’s a healthier setup. Distributed ownership reduces the risk of rug pulls or coordinated dumps.New integrations and ecosystem activity: If other apps are integrating the token or building on the protocol, it usually means the tech is solid and useful. This kind of network effect compounds fast and often precedes a breakout.Liquidity that builds slowly: Gradual increases in liquidity and trading volume tend to reflect real interest. If liquidity sticks around (rather than vanishing after a pump), it’s usually organic.Signs of manufactured hypeSudden spikes in social mentions or trading volume with no news: If the project is everywhere on X overnight, but there’s no product update, launch or roadmap shift, be skeptical. It’s likely a coordinated shill.Influencer spam and recycled talking points: When you see multiple anonymous influencers posting the same meme or catchphrase, that’s a signal someone’s trying to manufacture buzz.No dev activity or roadmap: If there’s no GitHub, no changelog and the team isn’t shipping anything, it’s probably just a hype machine.Anonymous team, outrageous promises: Combine a mystery team with claims like “100x guaranteed,” and you’re likely looking at a cash grab. Real builders let the work speak for itself.Rule of thumb: If the price is moving and everything else — users, devs, integrations — is standing still, you’re looking at hype. But when those fundamentals are quietly ticking up in the background? That’s when it’s worth a closer look.More red flagsSome projects look great on the surface — slick websites, trending hashtags, a fast-moving chart — but fall apart under the hood. Here are some more red flags to watch out for:High holder concentration: If most of the token is sitting in a handful of wallets, it doesn’t take much for a price crash. Whales often buy early and dump on retail.Unverified token contracts: A token that hasn’t been verified on Etherscan or BscScan might hide functions that allow minting, blocking wallets or draining liquidity. Always check the contract or look for an audit.No liquidity lock or audit: If the devs control all the liquidity provider tokens and there’s no lock or time-locked contract, they can pull the rug at any moment. Similarly, no third-party audit? That’s a gamble.Big token unlocks coming up: Large unlocks for insiders or early investors can trigger huge sell-offs. If you’re holding during a major vesting event, you could be exit liquidity. Know the schedule.Top tip: Before you click buy, ask, Who stands to gain the most if this pumps? Who gets hurt if it dumps? If the answer points to a few insiders with heavy bags and zero accountability, walk away.How to spot crypto trends before the crowdThe best early investors are the mechanics looking under the hood. They study token structures and unlock schedules, join communities early to catch signals firsthand, and follow the builders to see who’s actually shipping. Most importantly, they cross-check everything: on-chain data, social sentiment, developer activity, and liquidity. Tools like Dune, DefiLlama, Nansen and GitHub help them separate noise from substance — and spot winners before the crowd does.Crypto rewards those who are curious, critical and a little bit contrarian. The crowd usually shows up late. If you want to find gems before they moon, you’ll need to think independently, dig deeper, and act before the narrative forms.It’s not easy. But it’s doable. And the more you practice spotting early signals — the real ones, not the noise — the more second nature it becomes.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Source: PacerAccording to prosecutors, among Nguyen’s customer base were several scam victims who were tricked into converting cash into Bitcoin (BTC) by con artists overseas, as well as a drug dealer who sent $250,000 in cash across 10 transactions in 2018.The Justice Department said Nguyen converted more than $1 million to Bitcoin and “purposely failed” to register with the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) despite being required to do so under federal Anti-Money Laundering regulations.Nguyen also “failed to file Suspicious Activity Reports or Currency Transaction Reports on any of these transactions, including cash transactions of more than $10,000,” according to prosecutors.Undercover cops sting NguyenNguyen would often meet his clients in person to accept large sums of cash, which is how he was caught, prosecutors said.A May 2023 indictment said that during several meetings with undercover law enforcement officers, he accepted cash and sent Bitcoin in return, taking just over 5% in commission.Related: Crypto use in money laundering ‘far below’ cash — US TreasuryThe indictment said Nguyen used encrypted messaging apps and “technologies that made it more difficult” to trace his Bitcoin transactions and broke up the cash deposits into smaller sums over consecutive days and at different branches of the same bank to evade notice by authorities.Nguyen was charged with operating an unlicensed money transmitting business and two counts of money laundering. He pleaded not guilty to all charges in June 2023.A jury convicted him in November on the unlicensed money-transmitting business charge and on just one of the money laundering charges, finding him not guilty of a separate money laundering charge.Magazine: Lazarus Group’s favorite exploit revealed — Crypto hacks analysis",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/no-questions-asked-bitcoin-launderer-gets-6-years?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The bill adds that any cryptocurrencies must be held in the form of an exchange-traded product issued by a registered investment company.A similar bill was introduced in February, permitting the state treasurer to allocate up to 10% of Michigan’s Budget Stabilization Fund into crypto.Republican Representative Bryan Posthumus led the introduction of the second bipartisan crypto bill on May 21, HB 4511, which would prohibit Michigan from banning crypto or imposing licensing requirements on crypto holders.

According to a report from My London, Jacob Irwin-Cline went out to a London bar and had several drinks before calling an Uber to take him home.Cline said that he did not thoroughly check the details of the Uber ride on his phone and left with a random private cab driver resembling the Uber driver at first glance, but driving a different vehicle — a detail Cline would only discover after the incident.Once inside the vehicle, the US tourist said the driver offered him a cigarette, which Cline said was likely laced with a rare and potent sedative drug called scopolamine. Cline added that the cigarette made him feel extremely docile and tired, causing him to pass out for around 30 minutes before regaining consciousness.Shortly after Cline woke up, the driver ordered him out of the vehicle. As Cline exited, the driver suddenly sped off, striking him with the car and fleeing with his cellphone, which contained his private keys and access to his crypto accounts.The unfortunate incident comes amid a recent spate of kidnappings, extortion incidents, armed robberies, and ransom attempts directed at crypto industry executives, investors, and their families.

The proposed amendment would come after 18 Democrats sided with Republicans in the Senate in voting to advance the bill on May 20 after it failed a procedural vote on May 8.“Passing the GENIUS Act without our anti-corruption amendment stamps a Congressional seal of approval on Trump selling access and influence to the highest bidder,” Merkley said in a May 22 X post.Trump his three sons are involved in the crypto platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI), which launched its USD1 stablecoin in March.

Merkley is expected to attend a protest organized by the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, in partnership with progressive political organization Our Revolution, outside the Trump venue on May 22. Warren held a press conference with Merkley, Senator Chris Murphy and Public Citizen representatives, calling on Trump to “release the guest list” for the dinner event.

Far from being bearish, the current level leaves room for bullish positioning on XRP futures markets.Related: Which senators invest in crypto? 11 lawmakers have blockchain-related investmentsFavorable regulation opens the door for new partnerships and acquisitionsPart of the limited XRP price upside can be explained by the multiple rejections of US Senator Cynthia Lummis, Chair of the US Congress Digital Assets Subcommittee, to meet Ripple representatives. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse asked on May 19 that the lawmaker “reconsider and be a leader for ALL of crypto,” and discuss “how to make the US the crypto capital of the world.”There is nothing stopping XRP from hitting $3.50 or even higher, as Ripple Labs is no longer facing direct threats from regulators, which paves the way for partnerships and acquisitions.

2025-05-22T15:00:00.000Z,"Semiconductor exemptions don’t matter when it comes to tariffs","Opinion by: Ahmad Shadid of O.xyzSemiconductors scored a rare exemption from US President Donald Trump’s aggressive reciprocal tariffs, but the relief is symbolic at best. Most semiconductors enter the US embedded in servers, GPUs, laptops, and smartphones. The finished goods remain heavily tariffed, some with duties reaching up to 49%. The exemption looks good politically but delivers little practical benefit. Nvidia’s DGX systems, crucial for training advanced AI models, do not fall under the exempted HTS codes. Nvidia could pay effective tariffs nearing 40% on these vital components. Such costs threaten to stall critical AI infrastructure projects across the country. Semiconductor tariffs may compromise the goal of the CHIPS Act. The act promised tens of billions of dollars in subsidies to support domestic chip manufacturing. Yet advanced lithography machines — key equipment from countries like the Netherlands and Japan — face 20%–24% tariffs. Ironically, tariffs designed to boost American production increase the cost of essential manufacturing equipment.The effect of new tariffs is already slowing progress in critical supply chains — just as generative AI and large language models are gaining momentum across sectors like finance and defense. Any delays or cost increases now could blunt America’s technological advantage.Indirect costs undermine exemptions for AIModern semiconductor supply chains are global and highly integrated. An exemption on raw silicon means nothing when servers, GPUs and other finished products face steep tariffs. Tariffs indirectly inflate costs, eliminating any competitive advantage from domestic manufacturing.Indirect tariff costs hit high-end systems disproportionately hard. The effect ripples through AI model training, data center expansions and major infrastructure projects, significantly slowing the industry’s momentum.Tariff impasse halts investmentSo far, it’s clear that the US president’s tariff plan didn’t follow any conventional economic trends or calculated strategy. The uncertain tariff situation stalls investment decisions across the technology sector. Companies need predictable costs to justify large capital expenditures. Ongoing tariff volatility prevents them from committing resources to new data centers and manufacturing lines.This mirrors the supply chain chaos of 2020. At that time, uncertainty caused massive order cancellations and slowed industry recovery for years. If tariff ambiguity continues, we could see similar waves of cancellations in 2025. This would further compound existing inventory and revenue issues in the semiconductor sector.Domestic production is not optimalThe border argument for these tariffs is that they’re meant to boost domestic production. They do little, however, to encourage genuine domestic semiconductor production. Despite subsidies under the CHIPS Act, most US semiconductor companies still rely on international foundries for manufacturing. Instead, they face increased equipment and operational costs.Recent: How trade wars impact stocks and cryptoThe idea that tariffs promote domestic production ignores the reality of global semiconductor manufacturing. Costs rise across the board, putting American companies at a disadvantage rather than offering protection.AI projects face heightened riskThe blockchain and crypto sectors, particularly AI-driven projects, also feel the pinch. Projects depend heavily on GPUs and high-performance servers for mining, validating transactions and running decentralized AI computations. Increased hardware costs directly affect profitability and growth, potentially stalling innovation in blockchain applications. AI developments have just started to pick up the pace in the blockchain and Web3 space. The industry saw increased interest from investors and VCs just a year ago. So, they are still on tighter budgets. Elevated costs can, however, lead to stagnation. We might see innovators and developers exiting the market. The ripple effect extends beyond the general technology sector and could threaten future digital economies. Moreover, these cost pressures disproportionately affect startups and smaller tech firms. Industry giants can absorb additional expenses, but innovative, smaller players face existential threats. This dynamic risks stifling innovation at the grassroots level, harming the entire tech ecosystem.What to expect Semiconductors have momentarily escaped direct tariffs, but the exemption provides little benefit. Tariffs continue to hit finished products, driving up indirect costs across the industry. Instead of boosting domestic manufacturing, these tariffs create economic paralysis, stall critical infrastructure projects, and threaten America’s lead in AI innovation. Policymakers must acknowledge these realities and adjust their approach before irreversible damage is done to the nation’s technological future.Opinion by: Ahmad Shadid of O.xyz.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-22T13:30:00.000Z,"How staking incentivizes trust without burning energy","What if a financial system could run itself not by burning electricity, but by rewarding good behavior? That’s the promise of staking, a mechanism that powers many modern blockchains by turning users into network operators. In this week’s episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Gareth Jenkinson and Nathan Jeffay sit down with StarkWare’s Noam Nisan to unpack how this trustless engine works, why it matters and what’s really at stake.Understanding stakingJeffay began by highlighting how staking is part of the backbone that keeps the blockchain running, and runs itself, with volunteers.“By doing this, they’re saying, OK, we’re taking this task of running the blockchain seriously. Here's some of our money. We're putting it down. We're showing that we're serious about doing this.”To help unpack this topic further and examine the deeper mechanics behind staking, the hosts are joined by Noam Nisan, principal researcher at StarkWare and a widely respected computer scientist who has held roles at Google and Princeton.Related: How to handle crypto trading gains and losses on your balance sheet“So we have this general system with operators... Why would they want to do that? The system, the protocol, incentivizes them to actually run the system,” Nisan explained. “Basically, it can give them tokens for operating the system.”Staking offers what Nisan describes as two distinct types of security: computer science-based guarantees and economic disincentives for bad actors. “If a majority or supermajority, maybe two-thirds of the parties of the token of the staked amount are behaving properly... we can prove that the system acts correctly,” he said. “But you also have what I would call an economic guarantee... if they destroy the system, very likely the value of the token... will go down. So they are the one losing.”PoW vs PoSJenkinson, a vocal Bitcoin (BTC) supporter, posed the classic comparison: proof-of-work vs proof-of-stake. “Do you have any strong feelings about one or the other?” he asked.“The truth is that it’s not clear.. it's really a social question, I think.”Nisan noted that both mechanisms involve trade-offs around cost, control, and decentralization. The episode also explores the role of staking in tokenomics and system design. Nisan unpacks how fee mechanics and inflation controls, such as Ethereum’s minting curve, help keep the ecosystem in balance.To hear the full conversation on The Clear Crypto Podcast,  listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

2025-05-22T12:38:44.000Z,"UK court partially dismisses Bitcoin SV investor’s lawsuit against Binance","The United Kingdom’s Court of Appeal has partially dismissed a lawsuit brought by Bitcoin SV investors against major crypto exchanges, including Binance, for allegedly conspiring to delist the token in 2019.In a judgment handed down on May 21, the court ruled that investors who held BSV through the delisting period (classified as “sub-class B”) were not entitled to billions in speculative damages based on BSV’s hypothetical growth.These investors had claimed over 8.9 billion British pounds ($11.9 billion) in damages, asserting that Binance’s delisting deprived holders of the chance to profit from BSV’s potential rise to a “top-tier cryptocurrency” like Bitcoin (BTC) or Bitcoin Cash (BCH).The court rejected this “foregone growth effect” theory, stating, “BSV was obviously not a unique cryptocurrency without reasonably similar substitutes,” pointing to the representative’s own use of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash as comparators.Sub-class B’s central claim was that delisting led to a missed opportunity to benefit from price appreciation. However, the court determined that those investors had ample chance to mitigate losses by selling or reinvesting in other crypto assets.“They had a duty to mitigate their losses,” wrote Master of the Rolls Sir Geoffrey Vos. “They cannot recover losses that they could reasonably have mitigated.”UK court ruling against Bitcoin SV investor’s lawsuit. Source: CaselawRelated: Bitcoin SV investors attempt to resurrect 2019 Binance lawsuitCourt strikes down “loss of a chance” argumentThe appeal also challenged the Tribunal’s application of the “market mitigation rule,” arguing that such issues should be left for trial.The court dismissed that notion, stating the rule clearly applies to freely tradable assets like BSV, and that the damages must be measured shortly after the delisting.An additional argument concerning the “loss of a chance” to benefit from future price gains was also struck down. The court ruled it “flawed as a matter of principle,” noting that “cryptocurrencies are, by their nature, volatile investments.”Binance’s limited strike-out application ultimately succeeded, with the court stating that even if some holders were unaware of the delisting, “they could never claim more than the total value of their holding before the delisting events plus any quantifiable consequential losses.”Related: Binance wants arbitration for all members of securities class suitBinance seeks to dismiss FTX lawsuitOn May 16, Binance filed a motion to dismiss a $1.76 billion lawsuit filed by the FTX estate, arguing that the claims are legally flawed and an attempt to shift responsibility for FTX’s collapse.The exchange stated the downfall of FTX stemmed from internal fraud, not external manipulation, citing Sam Bankman-Fried’s conviction on multiple fraud charges.Binance has asked the court to dismiss all claims with prejudice.

Source: DeBankTrader loses out on $2.6 million gainWith ETH up over 70% since the sale, the trader lost out on over 1,000 ETH, or roughly $2.67 million, in the process of buying back in. If the trader decided to hold on to their Ether, the assets would be worth about $6.7 million. As ETH rallied, the asset surpassed the market capitalization of big companies like Coca-Cola and Alibaba. At the time of writing, company data tracker 8marketcap shows that Ether’s $321 billion market capitalization makes it the 38th most-valuable asset in the world, surpassing the pharmaceutical company AbbVie and inching closer to the Bank of America. Ether’s upswing is largely fueled by the successful launch of its Pectra upgrade. The new update introduced improvements to the network’s scalability, validator user experience and smart wallet functionality. These updates are expected to drive broader adoption of the Ethereum mainnet. Related: Bitcoin open interest hits record high as bulls stampede toward new BTC price highsETH leads crypto investment products with $205 million weekly inflowsAlong with its recent price appreciation, ETH-based investment products in the United States also saw renewed interest. A May 19 report from digital asset manager CoinShares revealed that US crypto investment products saw $785 million in inflows last week.

This represents 26% of all the inflows within the time period. This also brings ETH’s YTD total to over $575 million. The CoinShares report also attributed the increased inflows to renewed investor optimism following the Pectra upgrade and the Ethereum Foundation’s appointment of Tomasz Stańczak as a co-executive director. Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-trader-mistimed-eth-sale-loses-2-6m?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-22T10:21:18.000Z,"Can ChatGPT-powered AI agents really trade crypto for you?","Key takeawaysChatGPT-powered AI agents automate trading tasks using natural language prompts and API integrations, improving speed and consistency.Successes occur when ChatGPT is used as a support tool, not a fully autonomous trading system.Failures happen when traders over-rely on ChatGPT without real-time data, proper risk management or manual oversight.Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance.What if a crypto trader didn’t need to constantly check charts, worry about emotions, or stay up all night watching for sudden price swings? What if those tasks could be handled by an intelligent agent that understands instructions in plain English — and reacts within milliseconds? That’s where ChatGPT-powered AI agents come in.These tools combine natural language processing with real-time trading logic to automate decision-making in one of the world’s most volatile markets. From rebalancing portfolios to reacting to market sentiment, ChatGPT is being adapted to act as a trading assistant, risk manager and market analyst — all rolled into one. But can it truly match or even outperform human intuition? This article explores how far these agents have come, where they shine and where they still fall short.How ChatGPT-powered AI agents operate in cryptocurrency marketsChatGPT-powered AI agents are changing how people interact with crypto markets. These tools combine ChatGPT’s language abilities with external trading tools and APIs to help users monitor prices, understand trends and even place trades automatically. Instead of just reacting to charts or numbers, ChatGPT can understand plain language commands like “Buy Ethereum if the price drops below $2,000” or “Sell Bitcoin if RSI goes above 70.”These AI trading assistants can work with major platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, OKX and other centralized or decentralized exchanges and can also tap into decentralized finance (DeFi) tools and smart contracts. With the right setup, ChatGPT can help automate trading strategies based on both technical data and market news.Success stories vs. failures in ChatGPT-powered crypto tradingSome traders have used ChatGPT to assist in automating parts of their crypto trading processes, particularly for strategy generation and sentiment analysis. For example, a user shared on Reddit that they used a ChatGPT-based AI agent for technical analysis on Ether (ETH), feeding it four-hour and daily chart screenshots. By interpreting market sentiment, support and resistance zones, and other indicators, they managed to make $6,500 in profits.Similarly, in the broader crypto sector, ChatGPT has been applied to support project development activities such as drafting white papers and marketing content. A notable example is the launch of the “TURBO” memecoin, which reportedly reached a market capitalization of over $50 million in 2024. In this case, ChatGPT was used to streamline documentation and communication rather than manage trading activity, illustrating its usefulness as a support tool in crypto-related initiatives.However, limitations are evident when ChatGPT is applied beyond its core design. While ChatGPT could suggest a trading portfolio and explain its reasoning clearly, it lacks access to real-time market data and couldn’t respond to sudden volatility. In one instance, ChatGPT was allocated $100 across multiple tokens but failed to actively manage the portfolio as prices fluctuated. This resulted in missed opportunities and underperformance compared to dynamic algorithmic strategies.Individual experiences reinforce these observations. A Redditor exposed a scam where a YouTuber promoted a “ChatGPT trading bot” tutorial that led users to deploy malicious smart contracts. The contracts, generated using ChatGPT and passed off as safe, were designed to drain user wallets once funded. Victims collectively lost $17,240 in ETH, highlighting the danger of blindly trusting AI-generated code without proper auditing.Even when asked, “If I use ChatGPT to build an AI agent for crypto trading, can I become a millionaire?” ChatGPT responded with a realistic outlook — acknowledging that while it’s possible, success depends on having a profitable strategy, disciplined risk management, and the ability to scale effectively.Here is ChatGPT’s response:These cases suggest that while ChatGPT can support certain elements of the trading process, it should not be treated as a standalone solution for autonomous crypto trading.AI in crypto trading: Key benefits and limitationsAI tools like ChatGPT are increasingly being integrated into crypto trading workflows to improve speed, accuracy and efficiency. While they offer important advantages, they also carry specific limitations that traders must actively manage. Below are the main benefits and challenges:Key benefits of using AI for crypto tradingAI bots can execute trades in milliseconds, crucial for capturing opportunities in fast-moving crypto markets.Bots follow pre-programmed rules precisely, eliminating emotional biases that often affect human traders.Crypto markets are always open, and AI bots can monitor and act around the clock without interruption.A single bot can manage multiple trading pairs, exchanges and strategies simultaneously.ChatGPT can understand specific prompts like “Rebalance every Monday” or “Set stop-loss at 5%,” allowing flexible automation.Limitations of ChatGPT in cryptocurrency tradingChatGPT does not access live market data unless specifically integrated with external APIs (e.g., TradingView, CoinMarketCap or exchange websockets).Instructions must be clear and unambiguous; ChatGPT may misinterpret vague or complex commands.Improperly secured API keys or lack of two-factor authentication (2FA) can expose trading accounts to unauthorized access.ChatGPT’s cloud-based infrastructure can introduce latency, which could impact performance during highly volatile periods.ChatGPT does not monitor regional compliance rules; users must manually enforce trading limits based on local regulations.Ethical and regulatory implications of AI in crypto tradingAs AI becomes more integrated into trading systems, it raises significant ethical and regulatory concerns that stakeholders across the financial sector are beginning to address.Accountability: If an AI agent executes a harmful or unlawful trade, questions arise around legal responsibility. It remains unclear in many jurisdictions whether liability falls primarily on the developer, the trader using the AI system or the platform facilitating the transactions.Market manipulation risks: Autonomous AI bots could unintentionally engage in activities such as spoofing (placing and canceling fake orders to mislead the market) or wash trading (creating artificial volume), especially if not properly programmed with compliance safeguards.Regulatory oversight: Financial authorities, including the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the European Securities and Markets Authority, are actively studying the implications of AI and algorithmic trading. These agencies have recognized that traditional trading regulations may not fully account for autonomous decision-making by AI systems.Policy developments: In January 2024, the European Commission released updates to its Digital Finance Strategy, which included references to AI-based financial services. While not yet finalized, these draft regulations under the broader Digital Finance Package signal a move toward stricter compliance expectations for firms deploying AI in financial markets.Meanwhile, ethical crypto platforms are beginning to voluntarily disclose the use of trading bots in their systems. In parallel, open-source communities are advocating for clearer audit trails, improved model transparency and the establishment of ethical guidelines for AI applications in finance to ensure accountability and fairness.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
