2025-05-23T13:50:31.000Z,"HSBC Tokenized Deposit Service Accelerates 24/7 Corporate Payments in Hong Kong","BitcoinWorld HSBC Tokenized Deposit Service Accelerates 24/7 Corporate Payments in Hong Kong In a significant move signaling the growing convergence of traditional finance and digital assets, global banking giant HSBC has officially launched a groundbreaking service for its corporate clients in Hong Kong. This isn’t just another incremental update; it’s the debut of their blockchain-based HSBC tokenized deposit service, designed to fundamentally transform how businesses handle transactions. This launch represents a tangible step forward in the adoption of distributed ledger technology (DLT) within mainstream banking operations, specifically targeting the efficiency and speed of corporate treasury functions. For businesses operating in Hong Kong and dealing with HKD and USD, this service promises a new era of financial flexibility. Understanding Tokenized Deposits: What Are They? Before diving into the specifics of HSBC’s offering, let’s clarify the concept of Tokenized deposits . Simply put, a tokenized deposit is a digital representation of a commercial bank deposit liability on a distributed ledger or blockchain. Unlike stablecoins, which are often issued by non-banks or backed by reserves held elsewhere, tokenized deposits are direct liabilities of the issuing bank, just like the money you hold in your regular bank account. Think of it as your traditional bank balance, but existing and transferable on a blockchain network. This allows for programmatic settlement, instant transfers, and integration with other digital asset activities, while retaining the regulatory oversight and stability associated with commercial bank money. They are distinct from central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and other forms of cryptocurrencies. Key characteristics of Tokenized deposits often include: Issued by regulated commercial banks. Represent a direct claim on the bank, equivalent to traditional deposits. Operate on a blockchain or DLT platform. Enable faster, potentially 24/7, transfers and settlements. Can be integrated with smart contracts and other digital workflows. HSBC’s Specific Offering: The Hong Kong Edge HSBC’s new service focuses initially on corporate clients within Hong Kong. According to information released by the bank, this service facilitates real-time transfers of tokenized HKD and USD between wallets held by corporate customers directly at HSBC. This is a crucial detail – the transfers occur within the bank’s own ecosystem, which simplifies some of the regulatory and technical complexities associated with interbank transfers. The primary benefit highlighted is the ability to conduct these transfers 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Traditional corporate payments, especially international ones or those involving different banks, are often restricted by banking hours and settlement cycles. This 24/7 availability addresses a major pain point for global businesses operating across different time zones. The service leverages blockchain technology to ensure these transfers are not only real-time but also secure and efficient. By keeping the transfers within the HSBC network initially, the bank can control the environment, manage risks effectively, and provide a seamless experience for participating clients. How Blockchain Powers These Payments At the heart of this innovation are Blockchain payments . While the specific blockchain platform HSBC is using for this service hasn’t been publicly detailed for this specific launch (banks often explore private or permissioned ledgers for such applications), the underlying principles remain consistent with how blockchain enhances payment systems. Here’s how blockchain contributes to the efficiency and effectiveness of these Blockchain payments : Immutability: Once a transaction is recorded on the blockchain, it is extremely difficult to alter, providing a high degree of trust and auditability. Transparency (within the network): While not public like Bitcoin, participants on a permissioned network can have visibility into transactions relevant to them, improving reconciliation. Speed and Efficiency: By removing intermediaries and operating on a distributed ledger, transactions can be processed and settled much faster than traditional systems. Reduced Counterparty Risk: Within a closed loop like HSBC’s internal system, the risk is primarily the bank’s own creditworthiness, which is already inherent in traditional deposits. Automation: The tokenized nature allows for potential integration with smart contracts, enabling automated payments triggered by specific conditions. This use of DLT for Blockchain payments within a controlled banking environment demonstrates a practical application of the technology beyond speculative cryptocurrencies, focusing instead on improving existing financial infrastructure. Unlocking Efficiency: Benefits for Real-time Corporate Payments The introduction of this service brings significant advantages for corporate clients, particularly those requiring swift and flexible payment capabilities. The focus on Real-time corporate payments is a game-changer for treasury and finance departments. Let’s look at some key benefits: 24/7 Availability: As mentioned, the ability to transfer funds at any time, day or night, including weekends and holidays, provides unprecedented flexibility for businesses operating globally or needing to manage urgent payments. Improved Liquidity Management: Real-time visibility and control over funds allow treasurers to manage cash flow more effectively, potentially reducing the need to hold excess liquidity in various accounts. Faster Settlement: Transactions settle instantly between wallets on the platform, eliminating the delays associated with batch processing or traditional correspondent banking. Reduced Costs: While the exact fee structure hasn’t been detailed, DLT-based systems typically have lower operational costs compared to legacy infrastructure, potentially leading to reduced transaction fees for clients over time. Streamlined Reconciliation: The transparency and immutability of the ledger can simplify the reconciliation process, reducing manual effort and errors. Enhanced Operational Efficiency: Faster payments and easier reconciliation free up resources within finance departments, allowing them to focus on more strategic tasks. This move towards Real-time corporate payments via tokenized deposits aligns with the broader industry trend towards faster, more efficient, and always-available financial services. HSBC Tokenized Deposit vs. The Alternatives How does HSBC’s tokenized deposit service stack up against other forms of digital money and payment systems? It’s helpful to draw comparisons: Feature HSBC Tokenized Deposit Traditional Bank Transfer Public Network Cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin) Stablecoin (non-bank issued) Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) Issuer Commercial Bank (HSBC) Commercial Bank Decentralized Network Private Company/Entity Central Bank Liability Direct Bank Liability Direct Bank Liability No Issuer Liability Issuer Liability (depends on backing) Direct Central Bank Liability Underlying Tech Permissioned DLT/Blockchain Traditional Banking Infrastructure Public Blockchain Various Blockchains/DLTs Various DLTs/Platforms Availability 24/7 (within network) Limited by banking hours/cycles 24/7 24/7 Potentially 24/7 Regulatory Status Regulated (as bank deposit) Regulated Varies significantly Varies significantly State-backed/Regulated Primary Use Case Corporate Payments (within bank) General Payments Speculation, Peer-to-Peer (varies) Payments, DeFi Retail/Wholesale Payments (varies) This table highlights that HSBC’s offering is distinct. It leverages DLT like crypto and stablecoins for speed but retains the safety and regulatory framework of traditional bank deposits. It’s a hybrid approach, designed to bring the benefits of digital assets to the established financial system. Challenges and the Road Ahead While the launch of the HSBC tokenized deposit service is a positive step, it’s not without its challenges and limitations. Currently, the service appears limited to transfers between HSBC wallets. Expanding this to interbank transfers or cross-border payments introduces significant complexities, including: Interoperability: Ensuring different banks’ DLT systems can communicate and transact seamlessly. Regulatory Clarity: Developing consistent global regulatory frameworks for tokenized deposits and DLT-based financial instruments. Legal Frameworks: Adapting existing legal concepts of money and ownership to the digital asset space. Adoption: Encouraging widespread adoption among corporate clients and integrating with their existing treasury management systems. Cybersecurity: Ensuring the DLT platform and associated infrastructure are robust against cyber threats. Despite these hurdles, the launch signifies a commitment from a major global bank to explore and implement DLT solutions. The phased approach, starting within the bank’s own network in a specific jurisdiction like Hong Kong, is a common strategy to test and refine the technology before broader rollout. Hong Kong’s Growing Role in Digital Finance The choice of launching this service in Digital currency Hong Kong is also noteworthy. Hong Kong has been actively positioning itself as a hub for digital assets and financial technology. Regulatory bodies have been working on frameworks to accommodate virtual asset service providers and explore the potential of DLT in various financial applications. Initiatives like Project mBridge, a collaboration exploring multi-CBDC cross-border payments involving Hong Kong, further underscore the region’s ambition in the digital finance space. HSBC’s launch contributes to this ecosystem, demonstrating that established financial institutions are embracing digital transformation within the jurisdiction. The move reinforces Hong Kong’s status as a key player in the evolving landscape of Digital currency Hong Kong and Asia’s financial markets. HSBC’s Broader Digital Asset Strategy This tokenized deposit service isn’t happening in isolation. HSBC has been increasingly active in the digital asset space. They have been involved in exploring tokenized bonds, digital asset platforms (like Orion), and participating in various industry initiatives related to DLT and digital currencies. This launch is a natural progression of that strategy, focusing on a core banking product – deposits – and enhancing it with DLT. It reflects a growing understanding within large financial institutions that digital assets and DLT are not just about cryptocurrencies, but about building more efficient, programmable, and interconnected financial infrastructure for the future. What Does This Mean for the Future? The launch of the HSBC tokenized deposit service in Hong Kong is more than just a pilot project; it’s a tangible step towards the future of corporate finance. It signals that major banks are ready to move beyond exploration and begin implementing DLT-based solutions for real-world use cases. While initially limited, the potential for expansion is significant. Imagine a future where: Interbank transfers of tokenized deposits are instantaneous and available 24/7. Cross-border payments are settled in real-time using linked networks of tokenized currencies. Corporate treasury functions are highly automated, with smart contracts managing payments based on real-time data. Integration with other digital assets and platforms becomes seamless. This move by HSBC, a global leader in trade finance and corporate banking, could inspire other institutions to accelerate their own digital asset strategies, particularly concerning tokenized liabilities. It underscores the increasing importance of understanding both traditional finance and the emerging world of digital assets. Conclusion: A Milestone for Digital Finance HSBC’s launch of a tokenized deposit service for corporate clients in Hong Kong marks a significant milestone in the evolution of digital finance. By leveraging blockchain technology, the bank is enabling 24/7, real-time transfers of HKD and USD, directly addressing key inefficiencies in traditional corporate payment systems. This initiative provides tangible benefits like improved liquidity management, faster settlement, and enhanced operational efficiency for participating businesses. Positioned within Hong Kong’s ambitious push to become a digital asset hub, and as part of HSBC’s broader digital strategy, this service highlights the practical application of DLT in enhancing core banking products. While challenges remain, particularly concerning interoperability and broader adoption, this launch is a clear indicator that tokenized deposits are moving from concept to reality, paving the way for a more efficient, always-on financial future for corporate clients and potentially beyond.

2025-05-23T13:48:18.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Pauses Rally, Consolidates Around Recent Highs","Bitcoin’s (BTC) stunning rally is experiencing a pause after shattering the $110,000 level and surging to a new all-time high of $111,970 on Thursday. The rally pushed the flagship cryptocurrency into uncharted waters as it consolidated near record-high levels. BTC is marginally down during the ongoing session, trading around $111,000 after encountering resistance around $112,000. BTC’s rally was fueled by growing investor confidence, institutional interest, and the advancement of a pro-crypto stablecoin bill in the House, fueling hopes for regulatory clarity. Markets Flat As Bitcoin Surges To All-Time High US stocks ended Thursday relatively flat as markets factor in the House’s narrow approval of President Trump’s tax-and-spending package. The S&P 500 dropped 0.04%, while the Nasdaq Composite registered an increase of 0.28%. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded flat. The bill could add $4 trillion to the federal deficit, and includes sweeping tax cuts and substantially increased military spending. The bill passed the House by a single vote after last-minute revisions to include expanded deductions for state and local taxes and now heads to the Senate. Argent Capital’s Jed Ellerbroek discussed the bill, stating, “Short term, the tax bill is good for the economy. But in the longer term, it adds to the deficit, and that’s bad for markets.” Strategy Planning To Sell $2.1B Of Preferred Stock Michael Saylor’s Strategy has announced plans to offer and sell up to 10% of its perpetual Strife preferred stock (STRF). The firm plans to use the proceeds from the sale to expand its Bitcoin holdings beyond the current 576,230 BTC . The offering comes at $0.001 per share, which will allow the company to raise $2.1 billion to fund future Bitcoin acquisitions. Strategy stated in its press release, “The perpetual strife preferred stock, subject to the terms and conditions of the sales agreement, may be sold by agents by any method that is deemed an 'at the market offering.” The firm has been on an aggressive Bitcoin buying spree and revealed its latest acquisition on Monday, announcing the purchase of 7,390 BTC for $764.9 million at an average price of $103,498 per coin. Strategy now holds 576,230 BTC or 2.74% of its total supply. Strategy’s holdings are valued at approximately $64 billion at current prices, representing an unrealized profit of $24 billion. Bitcoin Open Interest Hits Record High Bitcoin futures open interest (OI) hit record levels on crypto derivatives exchanges as traders anticipate the asset will continue its rally. Open interest hit a peak of just over $80 billion on May 23, according to data from CoinGlass, representing a 30% increase since the start of the month. Open interest refers to the total number of outstanding futures contracts that allow traders to bet on Bitcoin’s future price, which have not been settled, indicating the total amount of market speculation. An increase in open interest indicates a build-up of leveraged positions in the market as traders hold positions with borrowed money. If the price moves against these leveraged positions, traders get liquidated, creating a rapid price decline. Bitcoin options markets are demonstrating a similar pattern, with open interest of over $1.5 billion at the $110,000 and $120,000 strike prices at the Deribit exchange. There is also over $1.5 billion in open interest at strike prices of $115,000, $120,000, and $130,000. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) surged past the $110,000 price level, setting a new all-time high of $111,970 on Thursday, fueled by positive macroeconomic developments and the advancement of a pro-crypto stablecoin bill. BTC’s stunning rally has taken a breather over the past 24 hours, as it registered a decline during the ongoing session after encountering resistance around $112,000. The flagship cryptocurrency has entered a price discovery phase as it consolidates around recent highs. Analysts believe the rally will resume after a brief pullback as overall sentiment remains bullish. BTC is stabilizing between $110,000 and $111,000, with bulls eying the $115,000 level as the immediate target. Alankar Saxena, Co-founder and CTO of Mudrex, stated, “Institutional inflows have helped BTC maintain sustained momentum, with Spot ETFs seeing over $600 million in net inflows in a day. Additionally, the US Dollar Index has dropped more than 2.6 percent over the last 10 days, making crypto an attractive hedge against inflation.” BTC could continue its upward trajectory but could also witness a pullback thanks to overbought market conditions. The flagship cryptocurrency registered a notable decline on Monday (May 12), as it started the previous week in the red. The price recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.36% to $104,123, but fell back in the red on Wednesday and settled at $103,568. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $101,459 on Thursday as selling pressure intensified. However, it recovered from this to register a marginal increase and settle at $103,816. Price action turned bearish on Friday and Saturday as BTC registered marginal declines and settled at $103,235. Despite the selling pressure, the price recovered on Sunday, rising over 3% to cross $106,000 and settle at $106,489. Source: TradingView BTC started the current week in the red, facing considerable selling pressure. As a result, the price plunged to an intraday low of $102,135 before recovering to settle at $105,572, ultimately registering a drop of nearly 1%. Despite the negative start to the week, BTC rebounded on Tuesday, rising 1.21% to cross $106,000 and settle at $106,854. The price continued to push higher on Wednesday, rising 2.57% to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,603. Buyers retained control on Thursday as BTC raced to a new all-time high, reaching an intraday high of $111,970 before settling at $111,582. The current session sees BTC down nearly 2%, with buyers losing momentum after encountering resistance around $112,000. The RSI also indicates overbought conditions, so the pullback is along expected lines. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Will the Trump Effect Continue in the Market?","US President Donald Trump continues to influence the cryptocurrency market with his statements. At this point, Trump, who recently made a customs tax statement towards the EU, caused a decline in Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins. Trump's proposal of a 50 percent customs duty on the European Union via his Truth Social account caused BTC to fall by more than 3 percent in a short time. Stating that the EU's primary goal is to take advantage of the United States in trade, Trump accused the EU of using VAT, penalties and currency manipulation to harm American companies. Saying that talks have stalled, Trump proposed a 50% tariff on all EU imports starting June 1, 2025. However, he added that goods produced in the US would be exempt from the tax. “It was very difficult to deal with the European Union, whose primary purpose was to exploit the US's advantage in TRADE. ….Our talks with them are going nowhere! Therefore, I propose a 50% direct Customs Duty on the European Union starting June 1, 2025. No Customs Duty if the product is manufactured or built in the USA.” US President Trump also gave Apple CEO Tim Cook a hard time about the tax. He shared that he clearly told the Apple CEO that all iPhones sold in the US must be manufactured in the US, not in India or other regions. If production is not done properly, Apple will have to pay at least 25% customs duty on each iPhone. Bitcoin, which broke a record yesterday, rose above $111,000 and reached a new ATH, fell to $107,400 after Trump's statements. BTC then recovered somewhat and rose to $108,800. Trump had previously caused a sudden and sharp decline in Bitcoin with his customs duty announcements against different countries such as China. News from both the US-China and US-Russia will determine the direction of Bitcoin and the market in the short term. Experts remind that risky and leveraged transactions should be avoided during these periods. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: What Caused the Sudden Drop in Bitcoin?

2025-05-23T13:30:52.000Z,"Justin Sun: Trump’s Crucial Crypto Embrace Signals Industry Turning Point","BitcoinWorld Justin Sun: Trump’s Crucial Crypto Embrace Signals Industry Turning Point The world of cryptocurrency is always buzzing with news, and recently, a notable figure weighed in on a potentially significant development: the evolving stance of former U.S. President Donald Trump towards digital assets. Tron founder Justin Sun, a prominent voice in the crypto space, has offered a compelling perspective on what this could mean for the industry’s future, particularly regarding Donald Trump crypto engagement and US crypto regulation . Why is Justin Sun Calling This a Turning Point? Speaking after attending a dinner event alongside U.S. President Donald Trump, where the guest list notably included top holders of the TRUMP token , Justin Sun shared his insights. He didn’t hold back, praising the former president’s increasingly pro-crypto posture as nothing short of a ‘game-changing moment’ for the entire industry. According to Sun, critics who dismiss this development are being ‘short-sighted’. For years, the crypto industry has navigated a complex and often uncertain regulatory landscape in the United States. Different government bodies have offered varying interpretations, leading to confusion and, at times, an environment perceived as hostile to innovation. A clear, or at least more favorable, stance from a major political figure like Donald Trump could signal a potential shift in official attitudes, impacting future policy and adoption. What’s Behind the Buzz Around Donald Trump Crypto Stance? Donald Trump’s position on cryptocurrency has seen a notable evolution. Previously, he expressed skepticism about Bitcoin. However, more recently, he has embraced digital assets, even launching his own NFT collections and accepting crypto donations for his campaign. His rhetoric has shifted to being overtly supportive, positioning himself as a champion for crypto against what he portrays as hostile regulatory approaches from political opponents. This change is significant because it brings the conversation about crypto legitimacy and its role in the economy into mainstream political discourse at the highest level. For many in the industry, this political endorsement from a major party figure is seen as a powerful validation, potentially paving the way for clearer, more favorable US crypto regulation in the future, regardless of who occupies the White House. Defending the Realm of Memecoins Beyond the high-level political discussion, Justin Sun also touched upon a more speculative, yet highly popular, corner of the market: Memecoins . Often viewed with skepticism by traditional finance and even some within the crypto community due to their volatility and lack of inherent utility, Sun offered a spirited defense. He argued that memecoins should be recognized as legitimate digital assets. His perspective is that, much like traditional businesses or investments, they involve both inherent risk and potential reward. While their value might be driven primarily by community sentiment, social media trends, and speculation rather than underlying technology or revenue streams, Sun implies this doesn’t inherently disqualify them in the broader digital asset ecosystem. This viewpoint resonates with a segment of the crypto market that sees memecoins as a form of cultural expression, community building, or simply a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity. The rise of tokens like the TRUMP token itself, tied to a political figure and driven by community enthusiasm, exemplifies the unique dynamics of this asset class. Here’s a simple way to look at the memecoin debate: Potential Rewards: High volatility can lead to massive gains in short periods. Community engagement can be strong. Accessibility for new users. Potential Risks: Extreme price swings, high potential for pump-and-dump schemes, value often based purely on speculation, lack of fundamental value, regulatory uncertainty. Is the US Becoming a Crypto Hub Again? Exploring US Crypto Regulation Sentiment Another crucial point raised by Justin Sun is the palpable shift in sentiment among crypto industry players regarding the United States. For a period, many crypto projects and entrepreneurs felt compelled to explore opportunities and establish operations outside the US due to perceived regulatory hurdles and a lack of clear guidance. However, recent signals, including increased political attention and potentially softening stances from some policymakers, are causing many to reconsider. Sun noted that a growing number of crypto participants are now looking at the US with renewed interest, viewing it as a potentially viable, or even attractive, hub for innovation once again. This potential reversal is critical. The US has historically been a leader in technological innovation. If the regulatory environment becomes more predictable and less adversarial, it could unlock significant investment, talent, and development within the country, benefiting the entire global crypto ecosystem. The dialogue around Donald Trump crypto views contributes to this shifting perception, signaling that crypto is becoming a bipartisan issue or at least one where major political figures are actively engaging. What Does This Potential ‘Turning Point’ Mean for You? While it’s too early to declare victory for crypto in the US, the developments highlighted by Justin Sun are undoubtedly significant. A major political figure actively supporting crypto, a defense of diverse digital assets like Memecoins , and a changing perception of US crypto regulation collectively point towards a potentially more favorable environment ahead. For investors, this might mean increased market stability and potentially more institutional adoption if regulatory clarity improves. For developers and entrepreneurs, it could signal new opportunities for building and launching projects within the US. However, it’s essential to remain cautious. Political stances can shift, regulatory processes are slow, and the inherent risks in assets like Memecoins do not disappear with political endorsements. This moment underscores the increasing integration of crypto into mainstream political and economic discussions. Whether you’re interested in the technological advancements, the investment opportunities presented by assets like the TRUMP token , or the broader implications of US crypto regulation , keeping an eye on these developments is crucial. In Summary: Justin Sun views Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance as a significant positive shift. The involvement of figures like Donald Trump crypto signals mainstream political acceptance. Sun defends Memecoins as legitimate assets with inherent risks and rewards. Sentiment regarding US crypto regulation is potentially improving, making the US more attractive for innovation. The future remains uncertain, but the conversation is moving towards greater acceptance and potential clarity. The coming months will reveal whether this moment truly represents a lasting turning point or just another chapter in the volatile history of crypto and its relationship with governments. Regardless, the fact that discussions around Justin Sun ‘s views, Donald Trump crypto positions, TRUMP token popularity, the nature of Memecoins , and the future of US crypto regulation are taking place at this level is a clear indicator of crypto’s growing influence.

2025-05-23T13:30:03.000Z,"Cardano Sees 25% OI Jump In 24 Hours As Bulls Eye Reversal Above $1","Cardano is currently showing a lot of bullish momentum as buyers have been returning to the crypto market. While its price is still below the $1 mark, there have been a lot of activity surrounding the altcoin that could suggest a run-up is on the horizon. These span from rising interest from crypto traders and investors alike, to crypto analysts predicting that technicals are showing a bullish reversal on the chart. Cardano Open Interest Rises 25% One major development for Cardano in the last few days has been the rise in attention that the altcoin has been garnering from the market. This is shown in the steady rise in the open interest of the cryptocurrency over the last few weeks, and culminating in a major jump in a 24-hour period. Data from Coinglass shows that between May 21 and May 22, the Cardano open interest went from $902.27 million to $958.05 million. This meant a 25% increase in the open interest in just a 24-hour period. This is also a long way from the $715.01 million low of May so far, especially as investors have begun to make their bets. Generally, the open interest represents the amount of open futures or options contracts of a particular cryptocurrency. It takes into account the total amount that has been invested in ADA derivatives products at any time, taking both the long and short positions. This means that if the open interest is falling, then crypto traders are placing less bets and if the open interest is rising, then they are taking more positions in the altcoin. As the open interest rises and more bets are placed , it seems that bears are expecting the Cardano price to crash from here. This is shown by the Long/Short ratio which shows 49.71% of all bets are long and 50.29% of bets are long. ADA Breaks Out Of Falling Wedge Pattern After the previous price crash, Cardano fell back into a falling wedge pattern as the altcoin traded in a tight range. Now, as the Bitcoin price has put in a new all-time high and altcoins are falling suit, Cardano is breaking out of this falling wedge pattern. Crypto analyst JimmyX highlighted this in an X post, showing a path for the breakout. The price is already moving toward the first target of $0.9508 after crossing the $0.8 mark. The next two targets for this breakout are $1.0295 and $1.1316.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-sees-25-oi-reversal-1/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Cardano|ADA|ADA news|ADA Price|adausd|ADAUSDT|Cardano news|Cardano Price",cryptocompare

2025-05-23T13:25:29.000Z,"Trump threatens 50% tariff on EU starting June 1 as trade talks stall","President Donald Trump announced Friday that the United States will impose a 50% tariff on all goods imported from the European Union, starting June 1, citing a complete breakdown in negotiations with the 27-member bloc. Trump made the announcement on Truth Social, writing, “I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union,” and claiming that talks have “gone nowhere.” This latest escalation landed less than thirty minutes after Trump also threatened Apple , warning the company it must begin manufacturing iPhones in the United States or face a 25% import tax. “If they are not made in the US, a tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple,” Trump posted . The comment triggered an immediate response from markets — Apple shares dropped 3% in premarket trading, and US stock futures fell across the board, with Dow Jones down 493 points, Nasdaq 100 down 1.7%, and S&P 500 sliding 1.3%. Trump lists grievances as trade officials prepare for face-off In his posts, Trump accused the European Union of building its foundation on exploiting US trade. He claimed the bloc uses tactics such as “Trade Barriers, VAT Taxes, ridiculous Corporate Penalties, Non-Monetary Trade Barriers, Monetary Manipulations,” and lawsuits against American firms, which he said contribute to a $250 billion trade deficit that he called “totally unacceptable.” Trump reiterated, “There is no Tariff if the product is built or manufactured in the United States.” The announcement also created pressure on US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, who is scheduled to meet European Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic later Friday. According to the Financial Times, Greer plans to tell Sefcovic that Brussels’ recent proposals still fail to meet American standards. The EU’s main executive body, the European Commission, declined to comment on the latest developments. Trump’s new tariff recommendation follows an earlier 20% tariff announcement on April 2nd, which he called part of his “reciprocal” policy approach. But Friday’s 50% figure marked a new level, one that some analysts say could destabilize trade if it becomes law. Speaking to CNBC’s Squawk Box , Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said, “To go to 10% was going to be the highest tariff rate that we had on the world in 90 years. To go to 50% is a completely different order of magnitude.” Goolsbee warned that such a decision would likely trigger a stagflationary effect — lowering economic output while raising prices. “That’s the Central Bank’s worst situation,” he said. Bond yields drop and Bitcoin slips after tariff threat As traders rushed to dump risk and move into government debt, bond markets across Europe reacted sharply. The German 10-year bund, widely considered the eurozone’s benchmark for stability, fell 8 basis points to 2.56%. French and Italian bonds also dropped, losing 5 basis points each. Swiss 10-year bonds declined by 12 basis points, reflecting investors seeking safe ground. Commodities and crypto markets didn’t escape either. Bitcoin, which had recently broken above $111,000, pulled back to $108,500. At the same time, gold prices exploded by over 50%, hitting a high of $3,351.15. The US dollar, already under pressure from domestic inflation concerns, slipped 1%, landing at 99.37 by mid-afternoon.

2025-05-23T13:23:59.000Z,"Why Is the Crypto Market Down Today?","The post Why Is the Crypto Market Down Today? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market witnessed a surprising pullback of almost 3% even as Bitcoin (BTC) briefly hit an all-time-high price of $112k. Meanwhile, another cryptocurrency such as Ethereum, XRP, Solana & Dogecoin saw a drop of nearly 3% to 5%. So, what’s driving this crypto market down? Bitcoin’s Drop Starts the Slide Bitcoin, the biggest and most popular cryptocurrency, saw its price fall by 2.6% in just 24 hours. After reaching $112K, it slipped to around $108,460. While this may not sound like a huge drop, it had a strong impact across the market. What triggered this drop was profit-taking. Many investors who had bought Bitcoin earlier chose to sell once it hit the new high. This led to a wave of selling and brought prices down. It’s a common move in the market when people want to secure their profits after a big rally. Over $500 Million in Liquidations The market drop also triggered massive liquidations. In the last 24 hours, over 163,000 traders lost their positions, adding up to over $544 million in total liquidations. A single trade worth $9.5 million was liquidated on OKX. Long traders, who were betting on prices going up, lost over $400 million. Altcoins Hit Even Harder While Bitcoin dropped, other coins fell even more, Ethereum, the biggest altcoin dropped by 4.3% to $2,541. Meanwhile, XRP, Solana, Cardano, and Tron also faced losses between 1,% and 4%. These coins usually follow Bitcoin’s movement, and this time was no different. Even memecoins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu took a massive hit. Therefore, Dogecoin dropped by 3.9%, Shiba Inu by 3.5%, and a Trump-themed token fell sharply by 13%.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-is-the-crypto-market-down/,"BTC|DOGE|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING","News",cryptocompare
2025-05-23T13:23:27.000Z,"Compass Mining Partners with Synota’s “Impact Mining” Initiative to Transform Bitcoin Hashrate into Community Impact","BitcoinWorld Compass Mining Partners with Synota’s “Impact Mining” Initiative to Transform Bitcoin Hashrate into Community Impact Initial donation supports a hospital and village in Nigeria , with plans for further expansion WILMINGTON, Del. , May 23, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — Compass Mining, a leading provider of Bitcoin mining infrastructure and services, proudly announces its role as the inaugural donor to Synota’s Impact Mining initiative. Through this groundbreaking partnership, Compass is turning Bitcoin’s computing power, or “hashrate”, into a humanitarian resource: affordable, reliable energy for underserved communities. Through this collaboration with Synota, Compass Mining aims to demonstrate another way the Bitcoin mining industry can contribute directly to energy access, healthcare, and education in underserved communities without leaving the data center. “This is hashrate with heart,” said Paul Gosker , CEO of Compass Mining. “We’re proud to show our customers and the broader industry how Bitcoin mining can improve lives, not just balance sheets.” Under the Impact Mining initiative, Compass Mining has directed some of the output of its mining machines to a Bitcoin mining pool configuration provided by Synota and managed on behalf of Renewvia Solar Africa, an operator of clean energy mini-grids in Africa . The revenue generated by this hashrate is used to offset electricity costs for critical infrastructure in Nigeria . At Oloibiri Hospital , Compass’s contribution is helping cover the monthly power bills. This allows the facility to redirect resources to patient care. Serving over 3,600 patients annually and having delivered over 34,000 babies since 2010, this hospital is now empowered to treat hundreds more. In Ozuzu , a rural village connected to a solar mini-grid in 2021, 150 homes, businesses, and a school are now benefiting from a 20% reduction in power costs thanks to Impact Mining. Lower energy prices mean more lighting, more technology use, and ultimately more economic opportunity. “Bitcoin mining has always been a driver of energy innovation,” said CJ Burnett, Chief Revenue Officer at Compass Mining. “Now it’s a driver of energy opportunity. A small portion of global hashrate is delivering outsized impact for real people.” Compass Mining views this initiative as a proof-of-concept that mining can be more than profitable; it can be purposeful. Whether through direct machine allocation or partial hashrate donations, every block solved can help power a brighter world. Looking ahead, Synota plans to expand the Impact Mining initiative and Compass Mining intends to continue the partnership. “We’re thrilled to have Compass Mining lead the way,” said Austin Mitchell, CEO and Co-founder of Synota. “They’ve shown that any miner, anywhere in the world, can take part in Impact Mining simply by redirecting a portion of their hashrate through a shared pool configuration. It’s a small step that can make a big difference. Donating hashrate also offers tax advantages, and we’re building the infrastructure to support that.” To learn more about Impact Mining, visit synota.io/impact-mining .

2025-05-23T13:19:51.000Z,"Crypto Price Analysis 5-23: BITCOIN: BTC, ETHEREUM: ETH, SOLANA: SOL, RIPPLE: XRP, DOGWIFHAT: WIF, INJECTIVE: INJ","The crypto market’s rally tapered off after Bitcoin (BTC) settled between $110,000 and $111,000. The flagship cryptocurrency shattered its previous all-time high as it surged to $111,970, entering a period of price discovery. However, it registered a decline from this level, ultimately dropping to its current level at around $110,700. BTC is marginally down over the past 24 hours, taking a breather and consolidating around recent highs. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) continued its upward trajectory, with the price up over 2%, trading around $2,690. Buyers will look to retain momentum and push the price above $2,700. Ripple (XRP) also continued its upward trajectory and is up 1.37%, while Solana (SOL) reclaimed $180 with an increase of over 3% in the past 24 hours. Dogecoin (DOGE) , Cardano (ADA) , Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , Polkadot (DOT) , Toncoin (TON) , and Litecoin (LTC) also registered notable increases. Meanwhile, the crypto market cap crossed $3.50 trillion, registering a marginal increase in the past 24 hours. Dow Jones Ends Flat As Bitcoin Surges US stocks registered a mixed performance as markets came to terms with the House’s approval of President Trump’s tax-and-spending package. As a result, the S&P 500 dropped 0.04%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded flat. However, the Nasdaq Composite registered an increase of 0.28%. According to estimates by the Congressional Budget Office, the legislation adds $4 trillion to the federal deficit and includes sweeping tax cuts and increased military spending. The bill passed the House by a single vote after last-minute revisions, including expanded deductions for state and local taxes. The bill will now head to the Senate. Analysts believe weak demand at Wednesday’s 20-year bond auction fueled a sell-off in Treasurys. Additionally, concerns about debt sustainability persist. Argent Capital’s Jed Ellerbroek stated, “Short term, the tax bill is good for the economy. But in the longer term, it adds to the deficit, and that’s bad for markets.” Democrats Propose Crypto Ban For Politicians House Democrats, led by Rep Maxine Waters, have introduced the “Stop Trading, Retention, and Unfair Market Payoffs in Crypto Act of 2025.” The bill aims to prohibit the President, Vice President, members of Congress, and their immediate families from owning, promoting, or profiting from digital assets while in office. It also bars lawmakers from holding crypto assets in ways that allow them to exert unilateral control over the tokens. Rep Waters said in a statement, “Trump’s crypto con is not just a scam to target investors. It’s also a dangerous backdoor for selling influence over American policies to the highest foreign bidder.” The legislation comes amid growing criticism of President Trump’s ties to crypto. Trump and his wife launched meme coins just before the inauguration, while the Trump family is also invested in crypto through World Liberty Financial. Meanwhile, protests erupted outside the venue of President Trump’s high-profile gala for top holders of the TRUMP meme coin. Token holders spent between $55,000 and $38 million in tokens to secure an invitation. Critics have accused Trump of auctioning access to the White House and potentially violating the Constitution’s ban on foreign gifts. Senators Chris Murphy, Elizabeth Warren, and Jeff Merkley, along with Rep. Sam Liccardo, and advocacy groups, have called the upcoming meme coin fundraising dinner a threat to national security and a potential corruption risk. Russian Crypto Miners Post $200M Revenue For FY2024 The Russian crypto mining sector continues to register robust growth, with BitRiver and Intelion, the country’s largest mining firms, reporting $200 million in revenue in FY2024. Data reveals that both firms have captured 50% of the Russian market. Intelion has reported impressive growth, increasing its revenue by RUB 3,948 million ($50,000). Media outlets used the country’s top miners’ latest public declarations to compile the data. The data suggested that Russia’s vast illegal crypto-mining sector was largely unaccounted for. The data also revealed how much power the country’s top crypto miners use. It also shows where the miners have built their biggest data centers and the type of energy mixes used to power their rigs. The data shows that BitRiver reported RUB 10.286 billion (over $129 million) in revenue in 2024 and used 533 MW of power across 15 data centers. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) shattered the $110,000 barrier earlier this week as it surged to a new all-time high of $111,970 on Thursday, losing momentum just short of $112,000. The flagship cryptocurrency seems to be taking a breather as it consolidates around recent highs. BTC’s rally came despite starting the week in bearish territory, as it plunged to an intraday low of $102,135 on Monday before rebounding. BTC faces resistance around the $112,000 level. A break above this level could see the price surge to $115,000 and $120,000. Despite facing selling pressure during the ongoing session, BTC has held above $110,000 as buyers look to consolidate and keep momentum going. Institutional inflows and interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs have also helped BTC sustain its momentum. Alankar Saxena, Co-founder and CTO of Mudrex, stated, “Institutional inflows have helped BTC maintain sustained momentum, with Spot ETFs seeing over $600 million in net inflows in a day. Additionally, the US Dollar Index has dropped more than 2.6 percent over the last 10 days, making crypto an attractive hedge against inflation.” Analysts believe BTC bulls will target the $115,000 level in the near term and attempt to extend the rally to $120,000. However, they also expect a pullback before the rally resumes, thanks to overbought conditions. “A pullback post this is likely given its overbought conditions, though the rally can extend like in December 2024. Market sentiment continues to strengthen with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index climbing to 78 (Extreme Greed).” Additionally, Bitcoin Open Interest (OI) has hit record levels as traders anticipate continued price appreciation in the near term. BTC’s price action was mixed last week as it started in the red before recovering on Tuesday and settling at $104,123. The price was back in the red on Wednesday, falling 0.53% to $103,568. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $101,459 on Thursday as selling pressure intensified. It recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $103,816. The flagship cryptocurrency was back in bearish territory on Friday and Saturday, registering marginal declines to settle at $103,235. However, it recovered on Sunday, rising over 3% to cross $106,000 and settle at $106,489. Source: TradingView BTC started the current week in the red, facing considerable selling pressure. As a result, the price plunged to an intraday low of $102,135 before recovering to settle at $105,572, ultimately registering a drop of nearly 1%. Despite the negative start to the week, BTC rebounded on Tuesday, rising 1.21% to cross $106,000 and settle at $106,854. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as the price registered an increase of 2.57% and settled at $109,603. Buyers retained control on Thursday as BTC rallied to an all-time high of $111,970 before pulling back and settling at $111,582. The flagship cryptocurrency has declined during the ongoing session, with the price down nearly 1%. Analysts expect a pullback due to overbought conditions but expect the rally to resume, with $115,000 the immediate target. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) continued its recovery despite facing selling pressure and volatility as it looks to reclaim $2,700. However, it faces resistance between $2,700 and $2,800. ETH must cross these levels to confirm a push to $3,000. ETH tested key support levels at the beginning of the week, falling to lows of $2,326 and $2,349 on Sunday and Monday. However, it rebounded both times, as bullish sentiment returned following BTC’s stellar performance this week. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is showing strong bullish momentum below the $2,700-$2,800 resistance levels. If the price breaks above these levels, a move to $3,000 becomes a possibility. Despite a lull in the crypto market’s rally, ETH has registered an increase of nearly 2%. ETH started the previous week in the red, registering a marginal decline before rising over 7% on Tuesday and settling at $2,681. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and fell nearly 3% on Wednesday to settle at $2,610. Bearish sentiment persisted on Thursday as ETH dropped 2.38%, slipping below $2,600 and settling at $2,548, but not before hitting an intraday low of $2,749. ETH attempted a recovery on Friday, rising to an intraday high of $2,648. However, it could not stay at this level and fell to $2,537, ultimately registering a marginal decline. Selling pressure intensified on Saturday as the price fell 2.44%, slipping below $2,500 and settling at $2,475. Source: TradingView ETH faced selling pressure and volatility on Sunday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. The price ultimately registered an increase of nearly 1% and settled at $2,498. ETH plunged to an intraday low of $2,349 on Monday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to register an increase of 1.18% and settle at $2,527. The price registered a marginal decline on Tuesday before rising 1.10% on Wednesday and settling at $2,552. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as ETH registered an increase of over 4% to reclaim $2,600 and settle at $2,664. The current session sees ETH marginally down as sellers look to lower the price while buyers look to move it beyond $2,700. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) crossed $180 during the ongoing session as it tested the resistance between $180 and $185. SOL’s price action has been exceptional over the past month, rising over 21% as it sets its sights on $200. SOL started the previous week positively and registered a substantial increase of 5.50% on Tuesday to cross $180 and settle at $183. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped nearly 4% on Wednesday, slipping below $180 and settling at $176. Sellers retained control on Thursday as the price fell over 4% to $169. SOL attempted a recovery on Friday but was unsuccessful, ultimately registering a drop of nearly 1% and settling at $167. Selling pressure persisted on Saturday as SOL fell 0.89% and settled at $165. Source: TradingView Despite the overwhelming bearish sentiment, SOL rebounded on Sunday, rising over 4% to reclaim $170 and settle at $173. However, it was back in the red on Monday, dropping to an intraday low of $159 before settling at $166, ultimately registering a decline of nearly 4%. SOL recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.05% to $168. The price continued to push higher on Wednesday, crossing $170 and settling at $173. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as SOL registered an increase of 3.51% and settled just shy of the $180 mark. The current session sees the price up nearly 3%, with SOL having crossed $180 and trading around $184. Buyers will look to retain control and push the price towards $200. Ripple (XRP) Price Analysis Ripple (XRP) was back in the spotlight after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed the reviews for spot XRP ETF applications. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart announced the delays, stating, “As expected, more delays on crypto ETFs dropped today. Delays include Bitwise Invest & CoinsShares XRP ETFs. Delay on Litecoin ETF Filing, Delay on Fidelity’s In-Kind Bitcoin filing. On the more positive side, SEC acknowledged Canary Fund’s staked TRX filing.” The news weighed on XRP as the token traded sluggishly compared to other altcoins. XRP registered a stunning rally last Monday, rising nearly 8% to $2.54. The price continued to push higher on Tuesday despite selling pressure, increasing 1.53% to $2.58. XRP lost momentum after reaching this level, dropping 1.20% on Wednesday and 6.51% on Thursday to slip below $2.50 and settle at $2.38. Price action remained bearish on Friday, registering a marginal decline to $2.37. Sellers retained control on Saturday, and XRP fell 1.04% to $2.35. Source: TradingView Despite the selling pressure, XRP rebounded on Sunday, rising over 3% and settling at $2.42.

The current session sees XRP marginally up as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. Dogwifhat (WIF) Price Analysis Dogwifhat (WIF) registered a stunning increase last Monday (May 12), surging over 26% and settling at $1.14. The price continued to push higher on Tuesday, rising 2.40% and settled at $1.17. Buyers lost momentum on Wednesday as WIF fell nearly 4% to $1.13. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as WIF plunged almost 13%, slipping below $1 and settling at $0.98. The price recovered on Friday, rising to an intraday high of $1.14 before settling at $1, ultimately registering an increase of nearly 2%. Sellers returned to the market on Saturday as WIF fell over 7% to $0.93. However, it recovered on Sunday, surging almost 15% to reclaim $1 and settle at $1.07.

2025-05-23T13:19:23.000Z,"Here’s what happened in crypto today","Today in crypto, Changpeng Zhao has responded forcefully to The Wall Street Journal’s latest report linking the former Binance CEO’s crypto dealings with the Trump-back decentralized finance platform World Liberty Financial, United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Commissioner Summer Mersinger said crypto perpetual futures could soon come to the US, and lawmakers plan to amend the GENIUS Act to bar sitting presidents from profiting off stablecoins. CZ refutes claims in latest WSJ article on Trump-linked crypto dealings Binance co-founder and former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has pushed back against a report in The Wall Street Journal, calling it a “hit piece” filled with inaccuracies and negative assumptions. In an X post, Zhao criticized the publication’s portrayal of his alleged involvement with World Liberty Financial, the decentralized finance project backed by a business entity affiliated with US President Donald Trump. Trump’s sons — Eric and Donald Jr. —are involved in the management of the company. Zhao said the WSJ article portrayed him as acting as a “fixer” for the WLF team and its co-founder Zach Witkoff during foreign trips. The article suggested Zhao facilitated introductions and meetings for WLF leaders during foreign trips, including a visit to Pakistan that reportedly resulted in a memorandum of understanding with a local official. “I am not a fixer for anyone,” Zhao said, firmly denying that he connected Pakistani official “Mr. Saqib” with WLF or organized any engagements abroad. “They had known each other way back, whereas I only met with Mr. Saqib for the first time in Pakistan.” Source: Changpeng Zhao Crypto perp futures coming “very soon” to US: CFTC’s Mersinger Outgoing Commodities and Futures Trading Commission Commissioner Summer Mersinger said on May 22 that the regulator could greenlight crypto perpetual futures contracts “very soon.” “We’re seeing some applications, and I believe we’ll see some of those products trading live very soon,” she told Bloomberg TV, adding it would be “great to get that trading back onshore in the United States.” Summer Mersinger on Bloomberg TV. Source: YouTube Crypto perpetual futures are derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate, often with high leverage, on the price of a cryptocurrency without actually owning it and can be held indefinitely. Mersinger, who will leave the CFTC at the end of May to join the crypto lobby group the Blockchain Association as CEO, said having crypto derivatives trading and regulated in the US would be a “really good thing for these markets and would be really beneficial to the industry broadly.” Senators plan to amend GENIUS Act to address Trump family's stablecoin Though a majority of members of the US Senate voted to advance a bill to regulate payment stablecoins on May 20, high-ranking Democrats are planning to propose an amendment to the legislation to address President Donald Trump’s connections to the cryptocurrency industry. According to a May 22 Axios report, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senators Elizabeth Warren and Jeff Merkley will file an amendment to the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act, or GENIUS Act, to block a US president from profiting from stablecoins. The proposed amendment would come after 18 Democrats sided with Republicans in the Senate in voting to advance the bill on May 20 after it failed a procedural vote on May 8. “Passing the GENIUS Act without our anti-corruption amendment stamps a Congressional seal of approval on Trump selling access and influence to the highest bidder,” Merkley said in a May 22 X post. Trump and his three sons are involved in the crypto platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI), which launched its USD1 stablecoin in March. Critics have pointed out that the president could continue to personally benefit from legislation that helps recognize stablecoins like USD1 as financial instruments in the US.",cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-happened-in-crypto-today?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|AVAX|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|ICO|LINK|LTC|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|UNI|USDT|XMR|XRP|ZEC|ZRX|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BNB|FDUSD|TON|USDC|ENA|BSV|ZK|WLD|OM|KAVA|BTG|ARKM","Trump memecoin|Solana memecoin|TRUMP token|Solana|SOL|Nova Labs|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|crypto regulation|TRUMP rally|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-05-23T13:15:13.000Z,"Binance spot to futures ratio reaches levels not seen since 2023","Binance saw an uptick in activity in the past month, with the biggest boost coming from the futures market. The clear bullish trend expanded demand for active trading with leverage, to make the best of the market’s direction. Binance is once again predominantly a futures market, increasing the ratio of futures to spot trading. The dominance of futures trading is near a 1.5-year high, reflecting the increased open interest for BTC and other active assets. The ratio increased vertically in the past month, reflecting the shift in sentiment and risk-taking. Binance carries $12.8B of the total BTC open interest, remaining the most active market with a slight price premium on the futures markets. The spot to futures ratio increased rapidly, returning to the highest levels in 1.5 years. | Source: Cryptoquant Futures volumes concentrated on Binance in 2025 as the undisputed leader. However, OKX futures markets showed a growth trend in the year to date. In May, Binance futures markets carried a total of $1.25T in trading volumes, on track to surpass the levels from April. Most of the crypto futures volumes are also concentrated on Bybit and Bitget. Futures trading points to speculative trend Growing futures trading suggests the crypto market is back in risk-on mode. Leveraged futures trading offers the biggest short-term return, especially during times of generally positive sentiment. On Binance, futures traders are 4.9 times more active compared to spot traders. While accumulation continues for BTC and ETH, especially by institutions and whale wallets, short-term gains are still considered for altcoins or hot assets. The growth in futures trading translated into a higher Fear and Greed Index. In the past week, the index moved up from 70 points to 78 points, crossing over into extreme greed territory. Even the fear of liquidations does not stop traders from betting on the BTC reversal of direction. Currently, most of the bets on BTC are in the range of $110,000 to $112,000, the two price levels with the biggest liquidity in futures positions. In the past day, short positions on BTC also expanded to over 53% on most major exchanges, against 46% for long positions. The risky trader behavior may translate into another short squeeze. Long traders are showing bullish sentiment, but remain cautious against liquidations. Stablecoins flow out of spot exchanges The main source of increased futures and derivative activity is the availability of stablecoins. Binance is the main target for USDT inflows, still carrying over $24B in available tokens. Binance increased its influence, currently holding over 22% of all exchange reserves. Spot exchanges barely carry a reserve of $90M in ERC-20 USDT stablecoins. Despite the all-time low of BTC and ETH reserves, spot buying from open markets remains much slower. Demand from whales, ETFs and corporate buyers also relies on OTC desks and private deals. The other source of futures and derivative activity comes from the global market activity on Binance. The exchange has blocked most of Europe from trading derivatives since 2022. Kraken has attempted to fill that niche, offering fully regulated crypto derivatives for the European market.

While most healthcare tech firms are playing it safe, what with the global turmoil, Semler is building up it’s Bitcoin vault – leveraging a fresh $114.8 million from a stock offering to buy up 455 BTC in less than 10 days. That brings the company’s total stash to a staggering 4,264 Bitcoin , worth $474.4 million as of May 22. This is a full throttle strategy. Semler’s Cure for Growth? More Bitcoin Between May 13 and May 22, Semler bought 455 BTC at an average price of $109,801 per coin. The purchase was funded using proceeds from an April 15 at-the-market (ATM) stock program that allows the company to sell up to $500 million in shares. So far, it’s sold more than 3 million shares, raising over $114.8 million . And it’s putting that capital straight into Bitcoin. Was this a knee-jerk move to jump on a trend? Absolutely not. In its SEC filing, the company made it clear: Bitcoin is now a core part of its financial strategy. It’s even tracking the “Bitcoin Yield” – which it says stands at 25.8% year-to-date. $SMLR acquires 455 #Bitcoins for $50 million and has generated BTC Yield of 25.8% YTD. Now holding 4,264 $BTC . Flywheel in motion. — Eric Semler (@SemlerEric) May 23, 2025 Losses Stack Up, But So Does Bitcoin Semler’s Bitcoin buying spree comes as the company struggles on the financial front. It posted a $64.7 million net loss in Q1 2025, and revenue fell 44% compared to last year. Makes you think – are they really in the best position right now? Plus, as of March 2023, the firm reported $41.8 million in paper losses on its Bitcoin holdings, with BTC trading at around $82,350 at the time. Still, the company is committed. That strategy is now getting more structure, too – with Natalie Brunell, a well-known Bitcoin advocate, joining the board and leading the new Bitcoin Strategy Committee. This is all in if I ever saw it. More Challenges Ahead? There’s legal noise in the background. Semler has reached a preliminary agreement to pay nearly $30 million in a civil settlement related to a Department of Justice investigation. The company hasn’t shared details, but it adds pressure at an already risky moment. Semler Now One of Bitcoin’s Biggest Corporate Holders With this latest purchase, Semler becomes the 12th-largest public holder of Bitcoin, surpassing names like Boyaa Interactive. The company even launched a live Bitcoin dashboard to display its holdings – part of its strategy to stay transparent with investors and aligned with public reporting rules. Semler is betting that Bitcoin is the right long-term move. It’s a high-risk, high-reward play that few in traditional healthcare would dare to make.

2025-05-23T13:13:36.000Z,"HYPE Hits New All-Time High as Hyperliquid Open Interest Surges Past $9B","Hyperliquid’s native HYPE token surged to a historic all-time high (ATH) of $37.24 (CoinGecko) on May 23, cementing its place among the most-watched digital assets in the market. The rally capped a week of explosive growth fueled by regulatory momentum, eye-popping whale activity, and a $9.37 billion open interest (OI) milestone showcasing the platform’s growing dominance in decentralized derivatives trading. Regulatory Breakthrough Meets DeFi Ambition At the time of this writing, HYPE was up 14.5% over the past 24 hours, rising from $30.78 to a new ATH of $35.35, and marking gains of 37.7% in the last seven days. In the past month alone, the token has skyrocketed 94%, and has registered even better numbers year-to-date, adding an impressive 868.7% to its price since hitting a low of $3.81 late last year. The pump comes against a backdrop of Bitcoin’s own dramatic rise to nearly $112,000, pushing its market cap above $2.2 trillion. At the heart of the HYPE uptick is Hyperliquid Lab’s proactive regulatory engagement. On May 23, the team announced it had submitted two formal comment letters to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), addressing perpetual derivatives and 24/7 trading. Praising the agency’s openness, Hyperliquid advocated for decentralized finance (DeFi) frameworks as a path to market efficiency, integrity, and user protection. “Supporting defi in the U.S. with open dialogue and a clear regulatory framework is an opportunity to ensure the U.S. remains a leader in financial innovation while robustly protecting users,” the team stated. It also positioned itself as a case study for how blockchain-based systems can improve market efficiency and user protection, a narrative that seems to have resonated with traders. Open Interest Hits All-Time High Open interest across the protocol reflects this investor frenzy. Recent data from the on-chain analytics platform CoinGlass revealed that active derivatives contracts had jumped to over $9.3 billion, shattering the previous record of $8 billion from just days ago. HYPE contracts alone drew $747 million in demand, only trailing Bitcoin’s $4.06 billion and Ethereum’s $1.21 billion. Trading volume was also high, with more than $492 million in HYPE trades recorded in the last 24 hours. However, the bullish momentum wasn’t without casualties. According to blockchain tracker Spot On Chain, a whale, who initially bet heavily against HYPE with a 5x leveraged short position worth $57 million, was forced to capitulate today, locking in a $23.5 million loss as prices soared.

2025-05-23T13:13:06.000Z,"Most Promising Altcoins After Bitcoin Hits ATH: Litecoin (LTC), SUI Blockchain, and Unilabs Finance","Bitcoin’s recent breakout rally to a new all-time high has the crypto market buzzing. But what if the next big opportunity isn’t Bitcoin? The ongoing market recovery sheds light on promising altcoins that could offer huge potential. Investors diversifying beyond BTC have taken notice of Unilabs Finance , innovative SUI blockchain, and Litecoin (LTC). Each project has a unique value proposition that positions it as a serious player in the crypto ecosystem. Let’s dive into why these altcoins could deliver significant returns in the next bull market cycle. What Makes Unilabs (UNIL) Attractive for Investors Unilabs (UNIL) is redefining DeFi with over $30M in assets under management backed by four specialized AI-driven investment funds. These include the BTC Fund, AI Fund, Mining Fund, and RWA Fund, each targeting a unique sector like real-world asset tokenization and Bitcoin Derivatives. Moreover, with its multi-strategy execution engine, Unilabs will adjust its portfolio strategies around the clock to optimize yield while managing risk. This feature continues to appeal to seasoned and new crypto investors, as the platform’s smart contract-powered funds can rebalance automatically based on the market shifts. With such an adaptive approach, Unilabs can track and respond to different market signals, whether the fluctuating Litecoin price or momentum within new ecosystems like the SUI blockchain. Unilabs’ Meme Coin Identification Tool Spots Emerging High-Potential Meme Tokens Beyond fund management, Unilabs also offers unique tools like the meme coin identification feature, designed to detect trending low-cap tokens with high liquidity and virality. This unique blend of utility and AI innovation makes Unilabs a powerful platform for anyone seeking smarter exposure to the DeFi economy. This has already seen the UNIL token raise over $859,000 in presale funding, with an attractive entry price of just $0.0051. SUI blockchain Prepares For Another Leg Up After an impressive 120% recovery, the SUI blockchain’s native token has been consolidating within a critical price range. The altcoin has been approaching a massive resistance level at $4.00, which it has failed to hold for seven days. A sustained breakout above this level could set the stage for more upside. SUI could break this range and open the token for the next leg higher. In addition, the altcoin has been building a re-accumulation range around the $3.39 and $3.78 levels, as it previously did last year. During that period, the SUI price consolidated near the range’s upper boundary before closing above this level. Source: CoinMarketCap The SUI blockchain’s native token also retested its support to validate a breakout towards a new all-time high. This time, SUI broke above the $3.78 level two weeks ago and validated the area as support, closing at around $3.94. The ongoing SUI price action indicates that the altcoin could rise to a new high. The SUI blockchain has also made notable strides that have drawn wider adoption. Its consolidation resembles its previous performance and could be loading its next leg up. Litecoin Price Builds Strength While Litecoin (LTC) has struggled in the current market cycle, hope is not lost. Litecoin price has consolidated above its critical support, which could spark a bounce. Meanwhile, the LTC/BTC has also formed a bullish pattern. On its daily charts, Litecoin price has increased in an ascending support trend line. While on this trajectory, the LTC token broke out from its horizontal area at $95 and attempted to confirm this level as support. This horizontal support has aligned with the trend line, which has increased its importance. Source: CoinMarketCap Therefore, the Litecoin price trajectory has remained bullish but hasn’t broken below the support levels. Adding to the bullish continuation, technical indicators have suggested that the LTC relative strength index has moved to the neutral region, with more room for growth. While the Litecoin price has fallen significantly since March, it has created a triple bottom pattern at b0.009, which is a bullish sign. This pattern and bullish divergence in the RSI have increased its legitimacy to outperform BTC soon. Conclusion As the Sui blockchain prepares for a potential rally, Litecoin's price movement continues to build momentum after consolidating above a key support level. However, amid the two altcoins' price movements, Unilabs is looking to mirror Bitcoin's recent rally, which has seen it achieve a new ATH.

2025-05-23T13:13:01.000Z,"Can ChatGPT-powered AI agents really trade crypto for you?","Key takeaways ChatGPT-powered AI agents automate trading tasks using natural language prompts and API integrations, improving speed and consistency. Successes occur when ChatGPT is used as a support tool, not a fully autonomous trading system. Failures happen when traders over-rely on ChatGPT without real-time data, proper risk management or manual oversight. Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance. What if a crypto trader didn’t need to constantly check charts, worry about emotions, or stay up all night watching for sudden price swings? What if those tasks could be handled by an intelligent agent that understands instructions in plain English — and reacts within milliseconds? That’s where ChatGPT-powered AI agents come in. These tools combine natural language processing with real-time trading logic to automate decision-making in one of the world’s most volatile markets. From rebalancing portfolios to reacting to market sentiment, ChatGPT is being adapted to act as a trading assistant, risk manager and market analyst — all rolled into one. But can it truly match or even outperform human intuition? This article explores how far these agents have come, where they shine and where they still fall short. How ChatGPT-powered AI agents operate in cryptocurrency markets ChatGPT-powered AI agents are changing how people interact with crypto markets. These tools combine ChatGPT’s language abilities with external trading tools and APIs to help users monitor prices, understand trends and even place trades automatically. Instead of just reacting to charts or numbers, ChatGPT can understand plain language commands like “Buy Ethereum if the price drops below $2,000” or “Sell Bitcoin if RSI goes above 70.” These AI trading assistants can work with major platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, OKX and other centralized or decentralized exchanges and can also tap into decentralized finance (DeFi) tools and smart contracts . With the right setup, ChatGPT can help automate trading strategies based on both technical data and market news. Success stories vs. failures in ChatGPT-powered crypto trading Some traders have used ChatGPT to assist in automating parts of their crypto trading processes, particularly for strategy generation and sentiment analysis . For example, a user shared on Reddit that they used a ChatGPT-based AI agent for technical analysis on Ether ( ETH ), feeding it four-hour and daily chart screenshots. By interpreting market sentiment, support and resistance zones, and other indicators, they managed to make $6,500 in profits. Similarly, in the broader crypto sector, ChatGPT has been applied to support project development activities such as drafting white papers and marketing content. A notable example is the launch of the “TURBO” memecoin, which reportedly reached a market capitalization of over $50 million in 2024. In this case, ChatGPT was used to streamline documentation and communication rather than manage trading activity, illustrating its usefulness as a support tool in crypto-related initiatives. However, limitations are evident when ChatGPT is applied beyond its core design. While ChatGPT could suggest a trading portfolio and explain its reasoning clearly, it lacks access to real-time market data and couldn’t respond to sudden volatility. In one instance, ChatGPT was allocated $100 across multiple tokens but failed to actively manage the portfolio as prices fluctuated. This resulted in missed opportunities and underperformance compared to dynamic algorithmic strategies. Individual experiences reinforce these observations. A Redditor exposed a scam where a YouTuber promoted a “ChatGPT trading bot” tutorial that led users to deploy malicious smart contracts. The contracts, generated using ChatGPT and passed off as safe, were designed to drain user wallets once funded. Victims collectively lost $17,240 in ETH, highlighting the danger of blindly trusting AI-generated code without proper auditing. Even when asked, “If I use ChatGPT to build an AI agent for crypto trading, can I become a millionaire?” ChatGPT responded with a realistic outlook — acknowledging that while it’s possible, success depends on having a profitable strategy, disciplined risk management, and the ability to scale effectively. Here is ChatGPT’s response: These cases suggest that while ChatGPT can support certain elements of the trading process, it should not be treated as a standalone solution for autonomous crypto trading. AI in crypto trading: Key benefits and limitations AI tools like ChatGPT are increasingly being integrated into crypto trading workflows to improve speed, accuracy and efficiency. While they offer important advantages, they also carry specific limitations that traders must actively manage. Below are the main benefits and challenges: Key benefits of using AI for crypto trading AI bots can execute trades in milliseconds, crucial for capturing opportunities in fast-moving crypto markets. Bots follow pre-programmed rules precisely, eliminating emotional biases that often affect human traders. Crypto markets are always open, and AI bots can monitor and act around the clock without interruption. A single bot can manage multiple trading pairs, exchanges and strategies simultaneously. ChatGPT can understand specific prompts like “Rebalance every Monday” or “Set stop-loss at 5%,” allowing flexible automation. Limitations of ChatGPT in cryptocurrency trading ChatGPT does not access live market data unless specifically integrated with external APIs (e.g., TradingView, CoinMarketCap or exchange websockets). Instructions must be clear and unambiguous; ChatGPT may misinterpret vague or complex commands. Improperly secured API keys or lack of two-factor authentication (2FA) can expose trading accounts to unauthorized access. ChatGPT’s cloud-based infrastructure can introduce latency, which could impact performance during highly volatile periods. ChatGPT does not monitor regional compliance rules; users must manually enforce trading limits based on local regulations. Ethical and regulatory implications of AI in crypto trading As AI becomes more integrated into trading systems, it raises significant ethical and regulatory concerns that stakeholders across the financial sector are beginning to address. Accountability: If an AI agent executes a harmful or unlawful trade, questions arise around legal responsibility. It remains unclear in many jurisdictions whether liability falls primarily on the developer, the trader using the AI system or the platform facilitating the transactions. Market manipulation risks: Autonomous AI bots could unintentionally engage in activities such as spoofing (placing and canceling fake orders to mislead the market) or wash trading (creating artificial volume), especially if not properly programmed with compliance safeguards. Regulatory oversight: Financial authorities, including the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the European Securities and Markets Authority, are actively studying the implications of AI and algorithmic trading. These agencies have recognized that traditional trading regulations may not fully account for autonomous decision-making by AI systems. Policy developments: In January 2024, the European Commission released updates to its Digital Finance Strategy, which included references to AI-based financial services. While not yet finalized, these draft regulations under the broader Digital Finance Package signal a move toward stricter compliance expectations for firms deploying AI in financial markets. Meanwhile, ethical crypto platforms are beginning to voluntarily disclose the use of trading bots in their systems. In parallel, open-source communities are advocating for clearer audit trails, improved model transparency and the establishment of ethical guidelines for AI applications in finance to ensure accountability and fairness.

2025-05-23T13:10:46.000Z,"Massachusetts Man Gets 6 Years for Illicit Unlicensed Cash-to-Bitcoin Service","BitcoinWorld Massachusetts Man Gets 6 Years for Illicit Unlicensed Cash-to-Bitcoin Service In a significant development highlighting the growing enforcement of cryptocurrency laws, a Massachusetts man has been handed a substantial prison sentence. Trung Nguyen, operating out of Danvers, received a six-year sentence and was ordered to forfeit $1.5 million. This harsh penalty stems from his operation of an unlicensed cash-to-Bitcoin service, underscoring the serious legal ramifications for those who fail to comply with essential crypto regulation. What Exactly Was This Unlicensed Crypto Exchange Doing? From September 2017 through October 2020, Trung Nguyen ran a service called National Vending. This operation wasn’t your typical vending machine business; it was essentially a cash-to-Bitcoin conversion service. Nguyen facilitated the exchange of physical cash for the popular digital currency, Bitcoin, on a large scale. Over the course of its operation, National Vending converted more than $1 million in cash into Bitcoin. While exchanging currency is a common financial activity, doing so professionally and at scale triggers specific legal obligations, particularly concerning money laundering prevention and consumer protection. Nguyen’s critical failure was operating this business without the necessary authorization. Why is FinCEN Registration So Crucial for Cash to Bitcoin Services? The core of the legal issue in Nguyen’s case revolves around federal anti-money laundering laws and the requirements set forth by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN. Businesses that transmit money, whether traditional currency or virtual currency, are typically classified as Money Transmitting Businesses (MTBs) or Money Services Businesses (MSBs). Under federal law, MTBs are required to register with FinCEN. This registration is not just a bureaucratic hurdle; it’s a fundamental step in combating financial crime. Registered businesses must implement compliance programs that include: Developing internal policies, procedures, and controls. Appointing a compliance officer. Providing ongoing employee training. Conducting independent reviews of the compliance program. Crucially, these businesses must also comply with Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requirements, which often involve reporting suspicious transactions and maintaining records. By failing to register his cash to Bitcoin service with FinCEN, Trung Nguyen bypassed these critical safeguards, making his operation vulnerable to illicit use and violating federal law. What Are the Risks Associated with Using an Unlicensed Crypto Exchange? While the legal consequences for operators like Nguyen are severe, using an unlicensed crypto exchange also poses significant risks for the individuals conducting transactions. If you’re considering converting cash to Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency, here’s why you should always opt for a properly licensed and regulated service: Legal Exposure: Engaging with an unlicensed service can inadvertently involve you in illegal activities. If the service is used for money laundering or other crimes, your transactions could be scrutinized, potentially leading to legal complications. Lack of Consumer Protection: Licensed exchanges operate under regulatory oversight, offering certain protections regarding funds, data security, and dispute resolution. Unlicensed services lack this oversight, leaving users exposed to scams, theft, or loss of funds with little recourse. Uncertainty of Legitimacy: Without FinCEN registration and compliance programs, there’s no guarantee that the service is legitimate or secure. You might be dealing with individuals who have no intention of actually providing the Bitcoin or who are involved in criminal enterprises. Poor Security Practices: Licensed platforms invest heavily in security infrastructure. Unlicensed operations may have lax security, making your cash, personal information, and crypto vulnerable to cyberattacks. The case against Nguyen serves as a stark reminder that convenience should not outweigh compliance and safety when dealing with cash to Bitcoin conversions. How Does This Case Impact Broader Crypto Regulation Efforts? This sentence in Massachusetts is part of a broader trend of increased enforcement against non-compliant cryptocurrency businesses. As the crypto market matures, regulators like FinCEN are paying closer attention to ensure that digital assets are not used as conduits for illicit finance. The message from authorities is clear: operating a business that facilitates the exchange of value, including cryptocurrencies, requires adherence to established financial regulations, particularly those designed to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. This includes obtaining the necessary licenses and registrations, implementing Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures, and monitoring transactions for suspicious activity. For legitimate businesses operating in the crypto space, this means doubling down on compliance efforts. For individuals, it means exercising due diligence when choosing platforms or services to buy, sell, or exchange cryptocurrencies, ensuring they are dealing with registered and regulated entities. Lessons Learned: Navigating the World of Bitcoin and Crypto Legally The Trung Nguyen case offers several key takeaways for anyone involved with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies: Compliance is Non-Negotiable: If you are operating any form of money service business involving crypto, federal and state regulations apply. Registration with FinCEN and compliance with AML laws are mandatory. Understand the Law: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency is complex and evolving. It is crucial for operators and users alike to understand the legal requirements in their jurisdiction. Due Diligence is Key: Whether you are a business owner or a user, always perform due diligence. For businesses, this means setting up robust compliance programs. For users, it means verifying the legitimacy and regulatory status of the services you use, especially for cash to Bitcoin transactions. Transparency Matters: Law enforcement and regulators prioritize transparency in financial transactions to combat illicit activity. Operating in the shadows, as Nguyen did with his unlicensed crypto exchange, significantly increases legal risk. Ignoring these principles can lead to severe consequences, as evidenced by the six-year prison sentence and significant financial forfeiture in this case. In Conclusion: A Warning for Unlicensed Crypto Operations The sentencing of Trung Nguyen in Massachusetts for running an unlicensed cash-to-Bitcoin service sends a powerful message throughout the cryptocurrency community. It underscores the unwavering commitment of U.S. authorities to enforce financial regulations, including those related to FinCEN registration and anti-money laundering laws, within the digital asset space. Operating an unlicensed crypto exchange is not merely a technicality; it is a serious federal offense with life-altering consequences. As the world of Bitcoin and crypto continues to grow, adherence to established legal frameworks is paramount for both operators and users to ensure safety, legitimacy, and avoid the severe penalties associated with non-compliance.

2025-05-23T13:05:54.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Is a Short-Term Pullback Inevitable After Recent Surge?","Bitcoin has once again broken higher, pushing through key resistance zones and extending its bullish momentum. After multiple attempts to reclaim the previous all-time highs, the market has finally shifted gears, with bulls regaining control amid a backdrop of improving sentiment and a strong technical structure. Now, the main question is how far can BTC reach? Technical Analysis The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, the breakout has been clean and convincing. The price surged through the $100K resistance zone, followed by a swift rally toward the $110K mark. The bullish structure remains intact, with the 100-day and 200-day moving averages providing strong dynamic support at $90K and $92K, respectively. The RSI is currently hovering in the overbought region, which may hint at short-term cooling but does not yet show divergence. Overall, as long as BTC holds above the $108K level, the path of least resistance remains to the upside. The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart reveals a rising channel structure that guided the price into the $108K all-time high region. After a textbook breakout from the consolidation, BTC surged through the upper boundary of the rising channel with strong momentum. The price has now stabilized around the $108K zone, which should now act as short-term support. With the RSI trending around 66, showing some relief from earlier overbought levels, the buyers still have room to push higher. For now, the $115K psychological resistance level is the immediate area to watch, while $108K becomes the key level that bulls must defend to avoid a deeper correction. Sentiment Analysis Active Addresses (100-day Moving Average) On-chain data adds more confidence to the ongoing uptrend. The number of active addresses has started to tick higher after months of decline, indicating a rebound in network activity. This uptick could be signaling renewed retail and institutional interest, often a precursor to sustained bullish momentum. Though still below the early 2024 highs in activity, the change in direction is encouraging and aligns with the current price trend. With strong price action across multiple timeframes and a resurgence in active addresses, Bitcoin appears well-positioned to continue its rally. However, with RSI extended on higher timeframes, short-term pullbacks remain possible. As long as the structure above $108K holds, any dip could be seen as a buying opportunity before the next leg higher.

2025-05-23T13:03:54.000Z,"XRP price stalls as Polymarket traders bet it will hit ATH in 2025","The XRP price stayed within a narrow range this week as Bitcoin soared to a record high, but Polymarket traders see this as the calm before the storm, anticipating an eventual rebound. Ripple ( XRP ) was trading at $2.4 on Friday, May 23, up by 50% from its lowest level in April this year. Polymarket traders are optimistic that the coin will bounce back and retest its all-time high before the year ends. For that to happen, it will need to jump by almost 40% to get to its record high of $3.3517, which it reached in 2018. Odds of XRP price rising to that level rose to 46% on Friday, up from 24% on May 1. XRP price has numerous catalysts that may push it to its all-time high this year. The most notable one is that the Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to approve several spot XRP ETFs later this year. Odds of this approval happening have risen to 85% on Polymarket. You might also like: The dollar is no longer issued, it’s minted by the internet | Opinion There are signs that spot XRP ETFs would be successful. JPMorgan has predicted that these funds will attract over $8 billion in inflows in the first year. Also, XXRP, a recently approved leveraged ETF has already attracted over $121 million in assets despite its 1.89% expense ratio. The other potential catalyst for XRP price is that Ripple Labs is in talks to acquire Circle , the creator of USD Coin. If the transaction goes through, Ripple will become the second biggest operator of stablecoins after Tether. It would also help to complement Ripple USD, which it launched last year. Further, XRP Ledger transactions are expected to keep growing in the coming months when the Hidden Road network migrates to the network. This is notable since Hidden Road handles over $10 billion a year. XRP price technical analysis XRP price chart | Source: crypto.news Technicals suggest that the XRP price will bounce back, and possibly hit its all-time high. It has remained above the 50-week Exponential Moving Average, which has provided it with support since November last year. XRP also remains above the key support at $1.9798, the upper side of the cup-and-handle pattern that formed between 2022 and 2024. The depth of this cup was 87%, and measuring the same distance from its upper side points to an eventual surge to $3.72, up slightly from the current all-time high of $3.5437.

2025-05-23T13:00:43.000Z,"Swedish healthcare tech Firm H100 Group Makes Bold Bitcoin Purchase","BitcoinWorld Swedish healthcare tech Firm H100 Group Makes Bold Bitcoin Purchase In a move that signals the growing intersection of traditional industries and the digital asset space, a Swedish healthcare tech firm has stepped into the world of cryptocurrency. H100 Group AB, based in Sweden, recently announced its first-ever Bitcoin purchase , adding a significant amount of the leading cryptocurrency to its balance sheet. This decision by a company rooted in healthcare technology is particularly noteworthy, highlighting the expanding reach of Institutional Bitcoin adoption beyond traditional finance and tech giants. Why is a Swedish Healthcare Tech Firm Buying Bitcoin? H100 Group AB’s acquisition involves 4.39 BTC, valued at approximately $490,830 at the time of the reported purchase. What’s particularly interesting about the H100 Group Bitcoin acquisition is the reported average cost of $111,785 per BTC. This figure suggests the purchase was likely made during a previous peak in Bitcoin’s market cycle, or perhaps reflects a specific strategy or timing known only to the company. Regardless of the timing or the high average cost relative to current prices, the fundamental decision to hold Bitcoin on their balance sheet is a significant one for a company in the healthcare technology sector. Companies typically consider adding assets like Bitcoin to their balance sheet for several strategic reasons: Store of Value: Viewing Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, similar to gold. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset class to their existing treasury reserves. Potential Appreciation: Betting on the long-term growth potential of Bitcoin as a digital asset. Signal to Market: Positioning the company as forward-thinking and adaptable to technological shifts. For a Swedish healthcare tech company, this move could also hint at future considerations regarding blockchain technology or digital assets within the healthcare ecosystem, although the primary stated purpose is often treasury management. Understanding Corporate Bitcoin Reserves The concept of companies holding Corporate Bitcoin reserves gained significant traction starting in 2020, primarily popularized by firms like MicroStrategy. These companies argue that traditional cash reserves lose value over time due to inflation, and that Bitcoin offers a superior alternative for preserving and potentially growing capital over the long term. The trend has seen various types of companies, from software firms to now healthcare tech, explore and execute Bitcoin purchase strategies. Building Corporate Bitcoin reserves isn’t without its challenges. Companies must navigate: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can be highly volatile, leading to significant fluctuations in the value of reserves. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Accounting Treatment: Accounting rules for digital assets can be complex and vary by jurisdiction. Security: Safely storing digital assets requires specialized knowledge and infrastructure. Despite these challenges, the list of publicly traded and private companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets continues to grow, indicating a maturing perception of Bitcoin as a legitimate treasury asset. H100 Group Bitcoin Purchase in the Context of Institutional Adoption The H100 Group Bitcoin acquisition is another data point in the broader trend of Institutional Bitcoin adoption . While 4.39 BTC may seem modest compared to the holdings of giants like MicroStrategy or Tesla, it represents a significant step for a company in a sector less commonly associated with crypto. This kind of adoption from diverse industries is crucial for Bitcoin’s long-term maturation and acceptance. Examples of other companies with significant Bitcoin holdings include: Company Sector Approximate BTC Holdings MicroStrategy Business Intelligence ~214,400 BTC Tesla Automotive/Energy ~9,720 BTC Marathon Digital Holdings Bitcoin Mining ~17,631 BTC Coinbase Cryptocurrency Exchange ~9,000 BTC While H100’s purchase is smaller, it signifies that the rationale for holding Bitcoin is resonating across different business models and geographic locations, extending the reach of Institutional Bitcoin adoption . Benefits and Challenges of a Bitcoin Purchase for Companies Like H100 Group A Bitcoin purchase offers potential upsides but also introduces specific risks for companies. For H100 Group, the benefits could include potential appreciation of their treasury assets, providing a hedge against inflationary pressures that could impact operational costs or the value of cash reserves. It positions them as innovative and potentially attractive to investors interested in companies exploring new asset classes. However, the challenges are considerable. The volatility means the value of their 4.39 BTC could drop significantly, impacting their balance sheet. Managing the security of the private keys is paramount, as loss or theft could be catastrophic. Furthermore, explaining the rationale and financial implications of holding a volatile asset like Bitcoin to shareholders and regulators requires clear communication and a robust strategy. For a Swedish healthcare tech firm, these challenges might require additional due diligence compared to a native crypto company. What Does This Mean for Swedish Healthcare Tech and Beyond? H100 Group’s move raises questions about the future intersection of healthcare technology and blockchain or cryptocurrencies. While this specific purchase is for treasury management, it opens the door to speculation about how digital assets or blockchain could be integrated into healthcare solutions in the future. Possibilities include secure patient data management, supply chain tracking for pharmaceuticals, or even novel payment systems within healthcare. While purely speculative at this stage for H100 Group specifically, their willingness to engage with the crypto space through a Bitcoin purchase could pave the way for future exploration of these technologies within the Swedish healthcare tech landscape. In conclusion, H100 Group AB’s decision to acquire Bitcoin is a notable event, marking the entry of a Swedish healthcare tech firm into the realm of Corporate Bitcoin reserves . While the reported high average cost is a point of curiosity, the underlying action aligns with the broader trend of Institutional Bitcoin adoption . This move underscores Bitcoin’s increasing acceptance as a legitimate treasury asset, even among companies in sectors previously unconnected to the crypto world, further solidifying its position in the global financial landscape.

2025-05-23T13:00:00.000Z,"Ledn ditches ETH, shifts to full custody model for Bitcoin loans","Digital asset lender Ledn is transitioning to fully collateralized Bitcoin lending and discontinuing support for Ethereum, in moves designed to consolidate its BTC-focused business and further safeguard client assets against credit risks. In adopting a full custody structure for Bitcoin ( BTC ) loans, Ledn will no longer lend out client assets to generate interest, the company disclosed on May 23. Instead, Bitcoin collateral will remain under full custody by Ledn or one of its designated funding partners. “This means assets aren’t rehypothecated, reused, or loaned out to generate yield,” Ledn co-founder and CEO Adam Reeds told Cointelegraph. Reeds said the move brings the company back to its roots and aligns more closely with Bitcoin’s founding principles. “Bitcoin was created as a direct response to the risks of fractional reserve banking and unchecked use of client assets to generate interest,” said Reed, adding: “Traditional finance relies on constantly reusing client assets to create leverage and, ultimately, inflation. Bitcoiners instinctively reject that model. That’s why we’ve moved away from this approach entirely. Reed told Cointelegraph that the company is ending support for Ether ( ETH ) as “part of a broader strategic shift,” as Bitcoin represents over 99% of Ledn’s client activity. “Rather than fragmenting the platform to chase marginal volume, we’re going all-in on Bitcoin and simplifying our stack to reflect what our clients actually value,” said Reed. Founded in 2018, Ledn has emerged as one of the largest lenders in the digital asset space with a loan book value of $9.9 billion, according to Galaxy Research . The company enables Bitcoin holders to borrow against their assets, giving them access to liquidity without having to sell their holdings or trigger a taxable event. This approach is commonly used by wealthy investors, who take out low-interest loans against stocks, real estate, and other assets to access cash. Bitcoin’s price has reached new all-time highs above $111,000. Instead of selling their assets for cash, long-term investors can borrow against their holdings. Source: Cointelegraph Related: ‘Before Bitcoin, my most successful investment was shorting the Bolivar’ — Ledn co-founder Digital assets are disrupting TradFi Bitcoin’s genesis block was mined in the wake of the global financial crisis in 2008, offering the world a sound money alternative to the inflation-prone fiat monetary system. Bitcoin now thrives within traditional finance, especially after the successful launch of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in 2024. Institutional investors have embraced the spot Bitcoin ETFs, as evidenced by the continued surge in cumulative inflows. Source: Farside While financial institutions are increasingly embracing Bitcoin, some members of the banking lobby are reportedly concerned about other blockchain innovations disrupting their business models. Specifically, the banking lobby is “panicking” over yield-bearing stablecoins, which can pay higher interest rates and other financial incentives that traditional banks have largely abandoned, according to New York University professor Austin Campbell. Referring to banks as a “cartel,” Campbell said financial institutions rely on fractional reserves to maximize profits while offering depositors minimal interest.

2025-05-23T12:51:40.000Z,"Ripple Price Analysis: What XRP Needs to Break Out of Consolidation","XRP has been showing signs of quiet accumulation within a broader consolidation structure. As of today, it continues to trade below major resistance zones but is building a compelling technical structure that could precede a significant move if confirmed by volume and momentum shifts. Technical Analysis The USDT Pair Looking at the XRP/USDT pair, the price remains tightly compressed inside a descending channel that has been developing since early 2025. The 100-day moving average (orange) is acting as dynamic support, while the 200-day moving average (blue) is now sloping upward and serving as another stronger support element. The price action recently tapped the upper bound of this triangle near $2.60 but failed to break through convincingly. Meanwhile, the buyers are currently defending the $2.40–$2.30 zone. A daily candle close above the $2.80 area could trigger bullish continuation, with $3 and $4 as immediate upside targets. Conversely, a breakdown below $2 would invalidate the structure and likely lead to a drop toward the lower boundary of the channel near the $1.5 mark. The BTC Pair Against Bitcoin, XRP is hovering just above key support at 2200 SAT, a level that has repeatedly held since mid-April. The pair has been trending lower within a descending channel, compressing against horizontal support. Both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages are now flattening out above the current price, acting as key dynamic resistance levels. This setup reflects a bearish bias unless bulls can reclaim 2400 SAT and push out of the descending channel and above the moving averages. The momentum is also clearly weakening, as reflected by the RSI sitting near 40, indicating a lack of bullish strength. If 2200 SAT is lost, XRP/BTC could quickly slide to the 1600-1800 SAT range, which is the next visible demand zone.

2025-05-23T12:50:36.000Z,"BlackRock’s BTC ETF Bets Are Back — Is Bitcoin About to Explode Past $110K?","Bitcoin dropped to $108,000 during European hours, down 1.4% on the day and below the ascending channel support. Despite $57.7 billion in 24 hour volume, failing to hold above $112,000 has triggered short term profit taking. The pullback coincides with macro uncertainty and a 2 hour bearish engulfing candle which is a sign of potential trend reversal. But beneath the surface institutional interest remains strong. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) now has $20 billion in notional open interest – Wall Street is getting in. Total options open interest is $65 billion according to Amberdata with traders betting BTC will hit $116,000 or $120,000 in the next few weeks. Bitcoin Options Open Interest Spikes to Record High as Traders Target $116K ► https://t.co/3qeyQt1ZOG https://t.co/3qeyQt1ZOG — Decrypt (@DecryptMedia) May 22, 2025 Points: BTC price: $108,000 Resistance: $112,000 BlackRock ETF open interest: $20B Options market OI: $65B Options Point to $120K Targets for Bitcoin Options are bullish medium term. Deribit’s order book shows $23 billion in call options vs $13.9 billion in puts – more traders are betting on higher prices. The skew is heavily in favor of upside bets especially for June expiry where large positions are building at strike prices between $110,000 and $130,000. Block Scholes notes an increase in out of the money calls and the overall put/call ratio is 0.61 – more bullish. There’s a lot of activity at strikes above current levels with $420 million and $620 million notional value on the $200K and $300K calls respectively. Call/Put volume: $23B / $13.9B Top strikes: $116K–$130K near term Long shots: $200K+ calls worth over $1B Expiries Add Risk, June is the Promise; Bitcoin Volatile 25,000 BTC options worth $2.81 billion are expiring today which will add to short term volatility. The put/call ratio for today is 1.22 – near term bearish. The “max pain” level – the price where most options expire worthless – is at $104,000 so a further drop is possible if momentum doesn’t bounce back soon. 25,000 BTC options are set to expire with a Put/Call Ratio of 1.22, a max pain point at $104,000, and a notional value of $2.81 billion. Meanwhile, 202,000 ETH options will also expire with a Put/Call Ratio of 1.26, a max pain point at $2,450, and a notional value of $570… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 23, 2025 But most of the interest has shifted to June 27 expiries which now account for over 30% of total open interest. Analysts like Peter Yan say this is a sign of deeper institutional positioning and expectations of more volatility ahead. Bitcoin Technical Outlook Technically, Bitcoin price prediction seems bullish as BTC needs to reclaim the $108,400–$108,650 zone to get back in a buying zone. If not, next supports are at $107,077 and $105,905. The MACD is showing a bearish crossover and expanding red histogram bars – be cautious.

But with technical pressure building and key options expiries in play, short term caution may prevail before the next breakout. BTC Bull Token Nears $7.14M Cap as 71% Staking Yield Fuels FOMO As the BTC/USD pair hovers near $108K, attention is rapidly turning to high-upside altcoins — and BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is stealing the spotlight. With $6.17 million raised out of its $7.14 million cap, momentum is accelerating as the next presale price jump closes in fast. What sets BTCBULL apart is its unique rewards model — token holders receive Bitcoin airdrops directly tied to BTC’s price rallies. The higher Bitcoin climbs, the more BTC gets distributed — with presale buyers receiving priority rewards over post-launch DEX investors. Key Stats: USDT Raised: $6,221,583.95 / $7,136,435 Token Price: $0.002525 Staking Pool: 1.47B BTCBULL Yield: ~71% APY Built-in scarcity adds even more firepower: every time Bitcoin rises by $50K, BTC Bull triggers a token burn, reducing supply and increasing upside potential for long-term holders. Meanwhile, staking is turning heads. BTCBULL offers a whopping ~71% APY on its Ethereum-based staking pool (currently holding 1.47B BTCBULL), with no lockups or withdrawal fees. That means passive yield — with full liquidity.

2025-05-23T12:48:44.000Z,"Is BlockDAG Ever Going to Launch? Bitcoin Solaris Comes Designed With Scarcity, Roadmaps and Launch Dates","The post Is BlockDAG Ever Going to Launch? Bitcoin Solaris Comes Designed With Scarcity, Roadmaps and Launch Dates appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News BlockDAG has generated considerable buzz with its claims of innovative architecture and scalability. However, despite aggressive marketing and wide social media traction, there is still no live product, no working mainnet, and no published date for token utility activation. Investors are increasingly asking when — or if — BlockDAG will deliver a functional blockchain. With no verifiable roadmap milestones achieved to date, the enthusiasm is being met with mounting skepticism. In contrast, Bitcoin Solaris is moving forward with a defined launch structure, detailed whitepaper, working infrastructure, and third-party audits already completed. While BlockDAG continues to operate in pre-launch ambiguity, Bitcoin Solaris is executing a step-by-step rollout grounded in transparency and provable scarcity. Bitcoin Solaris Offers Defined Token Supply and Network Participation Bitcoin Solaris maintains a hard cap of 21 million BTC-S tokens, with no future minting. Supply is allocated across fixed categories, with 20% designated for presale participants. The tokenomics are public, governed by smart contracts, and fully audited — ensuring that users are not exposed to shifting emissions or liquidity risks post-launch. Where BlockDAG has yet to detail its full economic model or provide clear evidence of token issuance mechanics, Bitcoin Solaris has already outlined its entire reward distribution structure through mobile mining and validator operations. This includes the upcoming Nova App, which will allow users to mine BTC-S directly from smartphones by contributing 1–5 GB of storage and idle CPU. Earnings are based on device uptime, not speculation. Mobile Mining and Live Architecture Distinguish Bitcoin Solaris Unlike concepts still in development, Bitcoin Solaris has completed its infrastructure build. The project operates on a dual-layer blockchain using Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Capacity (PoC) for base-layer security, combined with Proof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Time (PoT) on the Solaris execution layer. This system supports over 10,000 transactions per second with finality in two seconds — specs that are deployed and ready for global mobile participation. The Nova App is scheduled for rollout shortly after the close of the presale, with mining logic already tested and integrated. This timeline stands in sharp contrast to BlockDAG’s undefined roadmap and perpetual marketing phase. Independent Audits and Governance Verification Completed Bitcoin Solaris has completed a Cyberscope audit , confirming token contract behavior and emission limits. A Freshcoins audit evaluated system scalability and mobile mining integrity. The development team has also undergone full KYC verification , providing transparency around team leadership and governance. This level of review is not currently matched by BlockDAG, which has yet to publish any audit documentation or formal verification of team credentials. Presale Actively Underway With Fixed Terms Bitcoin Solaris is currently in Presale Phase 4, where BTC-S tokens are priced at 4 USDT. A total of 4.2 million tokens are allocated for this phase, and no further supply will be created. Participants are securing access not only to tokens but to early mining opportunities before network-wide competition begins. This presale is part of a clearly defined sequence leading into app launch, public listing, and mining rewards — all already laid out in the project documentation. By comparison, BlockDAG continues to accept new funds without delivering confirmed progress on protocol functionality or release dates. In a recent review, Crypto Volt discussed the gap between project visibility and technical readiness. He noted that Bitcoin Solaris is one of the few protocols offering both clear communication and demonstrable infrastructure — while others remain in promotional mode without delivering real functionality. BlockDAG continues to promise next-generation architecture, but the lack of a working product and concrete delivery timeline raises valid concerns. Bitcoin Solaris, by contrast, is delivering what the market increasingly demands: transparent launch phases, capped supply, audited contracts, and a live infrastructure. Now in Presale Phase 4 at 4 USDT, it offers users a clearly defined entry into protocol-level rewards before full network activity begins. For investors focused on delivery over speculation, the distinction is becoming harder to ignore.

2025-05-23T12:42:41.000Z,"A $0.03 entry could be life-changing — why MUTM’s on everyone’s radar","Back in 2010, hardly anyone paid attention when Bitcoin was under $1. In 2013, Dogecoin launched as a joke, and when it hovered around $0.001 for years, few saw it as a serious investment. Fast forward to 2021, Dogecoin turned ordinary holders into millionaires. Then came PEPE, and those who bought before it was listed on major exchanges like Binance witnessed history — and wealth — unfold. Today, there’s another name quietly rising through the ranks, and it’s capturing the attention of seasoned traders and newcomers alike: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The missed trains — and the one still at the station We’ve all heard stories from friends or online communities — the ones who missed Bitcoin, ignored Doge, dismissed PEPE. Regret, in crypto, is often the price of hesitation. The emotional sting of watching something 10x, 100x, even 1000x after passing on it is unforgettable. But what if there’s still a ticket to board the next rocket? With Mutuum Finance now in Phase 5 of its presale, 500 million tokens have already been sold, and over 10,950 holders have joined the ecosystem. Many early believers who entered in Phase 1 at $0.01 have already tripled their investment. The price has climbed by 200%, and we’re not even halfway to the top. What makes Mutuum Finance different Mutuum Finance isn’t just another hyped-up memecoin. It’s a fully decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol that gives users complete control over their assets. Its dual lending model — P2C (Pool-to-Contract) and P2P (Peer-to-Peer) — offers more flexibility and security than traditional DeFi systems. Whether you’re looking to lend your assets for yield or borrow without selling your crypto, Mutuum provides a seamless, trustless experience that adapts to your strategy. Lenders can deposit assets like ETH or DAI and receive mtTokens, which represent their share of the pool and grow in value as interest accrues. This isn’t speculative fluff — it’s a working ecosystem designed to reward long-term participants. For example, depositing $5,000 in ETH into the liquidity pool could generate annual passive income of 7% or more, depending on the pool’s utilization. That’s over $350 a year, without selling a single coin — and all while maintaining full custody of your assets. Beyond its use in the lending and borrowing protocol, the MUTM token has built-in utility. It serves as a token that offers access to protocol incentives, and is also used in Mutuum’s safety module. Here, users can stake their mtTokens to earn passive dividends. These dividends come from protocol revenue, where Mutuum buys back MUTM from the market and redistributes it to active stakers. This mechanism means that the more the platform grows, the more valuable and rewarding MUTM becomes. Holding MUTM isn’t just about hoping for price appreciation — it’s about earning from the protocol’s success. This window won’t stay open forever Every day that passes, more tokens are sold, more users onboard, and the entry price inches higher. In Phase 6, the token will cost $0.035, and it continues up to $0.06 by Phase 11. Waiting could mean watching your potential ROI shrink. At $0.03, you’re getting in at the early stages — but time is quickly running out. Wallet counts are climbing daily. Social mentions have surged, especially across Twitter and crypto forums, with increasing buzz from mid-sized influencers and Telegram groups. Several early-stage whales have already entered the project, sensing what smaller retail investors often overlook — a token with a solid use case, a committed dev team, and real demand. Every cycle has a few breakout tokens. In the last bull run, it was DOGE, PEPE, and SOL. In the next one, it could very well be MUTM. The fundamentals are here, the momentum is building, and the price is still low. People don’t talk about the tokens they bought too early. They talk about the ones they missed. The ones they ignored. The ones that got away while they were waiting for the “perfect time.” The truth is, $0.03 may be the last stop before the rocket launches. And for anyone watching from the sidelines, this might just be one of those “I should’ve” moments in the making. Imagine turning a small $300 entry into a five-figure windfall within a year, just by holding and staking. That isn’t a dream — it’s a calculated opportunity, and it’s staring us in the face. Mutuum Finance isn’t asking you to gamble on vaporware. It’s inviting you into an ecosystem already rewarding its users, already proving its use cases, and already gaining the traction that smart investors watch for. If you missed Bitcoin, missed Doge, and missed SHIB, this might be your redemption story. Don’t let $0.03 become your next $0.001 regret.

Meanwhile, across the Capitol, Representative Tom Emmer reintroduced the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, backed by bipartisan support.Breaking down GENIUSThe GENIUS Act — short for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act” — seeks to answer foundational questions around stablecoin issuance and oversight.“It defines this idea of a payment stablecoin,” explained Rashan Colbert, director of US policy at the Crypto Council for Innovation, in this week’s interview. Colbert emphasized that the bill doesn’t stop at definitions. “It outlines in a robust way just who’s allowed to do this and what they need to look like.” By this, he’s referring to guidelines on who can be permitted issuers like bank subsidiaries, credit unions and approved non-bank entities.Related: Interest groups, lawmakers to protest Trump’s memecoin dinnerThis bipartisan momentum seen backing the GENIUS Act is both exciting and significant. “There has been latent support within Congress, including within the Democratic caucus,” Colbert said. “They just haven’t had the opportunity to take meaningful votes.”Blockchain dev protectionOn the House side, the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, co-sponsored by Representatives Emmer and Ritchie Torres, aims to give legal clarity to developers and service providers who don’t custody customer funds.“It clarifies that they are not money transmitters,” said Colbert. “That’s the clarity these builders and entrepreneurs need to continue operating successfully.”With crypto adoption on the rise — particularly among minority communities — Colbert said the pressure is on. “Something like one in five Americans hold crypto. That number is even larger in the Black, Latino and Asian-American communities,” he noted.Looking ahead, the push toward broader market structure reform will be more complex. Colbert’s advice? Get involved. “It really is, at the end of the day, the people making their voices heard,” he said. “Crypto is a big deal — and Capitol Hill is finally starting to listen.”Listen to the full episode of Byte-Sized Insight for the complete interview on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

2025-05-23T13:00:00.000Z,"Ledn ditches ETH, shifts to full custody model for Bitcoin loans","Digital asset lender Ledn is transitioning to fully collateralized Bitcoin lending and discontinuing support for Ethereum, in moves designed to consolidate its BTC-focused business and further safeguard client assets against credit risks.In adopting a full custody structure for Bitcoin (BTC) loans, Ledn will no longer lend out client assets to generate interest, the company disclosed on May 23. Instead, Bitcoin collateral will remain under full custody by Ledn or one of its designated funding partners. “This means assets aren’t rehypothecated, reused, or loaned out to generate yield,” Ledn co-founder and CEO Adam Reeds told Cointelegraph. Reeds said the move brings the company back to its roots and aligns more closely with Bitcoin’s founding principles.“Bitcoin was created as a direct response to the risks of fractional reserve banking and unchecked use of client assets to generate interest,” said Reed, adding:“Traditional finance relies on constantly reusing client assets to create leverage and, ultimately, inflation. Bitcoiners instinctively reject that model. That’s why we’ve moved away from this approach entirely. Reed told Cointelegraph that the company is ending support for Ether (ETH) as “part of a broader strategic shift,” as Bitcoin represents over 99% of Ledn’s client activity. “Rather than fragmenting the platform to chase marginal volume, we’re going all-in on Bitcoin and simplifying our stack to reflect what our clients actually value,” said Reed.Founded in 2018, Ledn has emerged as one of the largest lenders in the digital asset space with a loan book value of $9.9 billion, according to Galaxy Research. The company enables Bitcoin holders to borrow against their assets, giving them access to liquidity without having to sell their holdings or trigger a taxable event.This approach is commonly used by wealthy investors, who take out low-interest loans against stocks, real estate, and other assets to access cash.Bitcoin’s price has reached new all-time highs above $111,000.

Trump’s sons — Eric and Donald Jr. —are involved in the management of the company.Zhao said the WSJ article portrayed him as acting as a “fixer” for the WLF team and its co-founder Zach Witkoff during foreign trips. The article suggested Zhao facilitated introductions and meetings for WLF leaders during foreign trips, including a visit to Pakistan that reportedly resulted in a memorandum of understanding with a local official.“I am not a fixer for anyone,” Zhao said, firmly denying that he connected Pakistani official “Mr. Saqib” with WLF or organized any engagements abroad. “They had known each other way back, whereas I only met with Mr. Saqib for the first time in Pakistan.” Source: Changpeng ZhaoWSJ reports on Steve and Zach WitkoffZhao’s response follows a WSJ investigation highlighting a complex string of diplomatic and business interests involving WLF. The report raised concerns about the blurred lines between public duties and private interests and focused on diplomatic and business dealings involving WLF co-founders Steve Witkoff and his son, Zach Witkoff. Steve Witkoff serves as the US Special Envoy to the Middle East under the Trump administration, while Zach Witkoff has been involved in securing a reported $2 billion crypto deal.The report raised questions about whether diplomatic efforts overlapped with private crypto ventures, and implied Zhao may have been attempting to curry favor with the Trump administrationOn May 6, Zhao confirmed that he is seeking a pardon from the Trump administration for his earlier money laundering conviction. The report also highlighted that WLFI, which raised over $600 million in token sales, does not disclose the names of all its investors aside from some publicly known ones like Tron founder Justin Sun, who attended Trump’s memecoin dinner on May 22. Trump hosted the dinner for the largest investors of his Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin.

Just connect and transact.” Bukov said that this gives DeFi an edge over traditional financial institutions in reaching the 1.4 billion unbanked people who remain excluded from traditional finance due to high onboarding expenses.1inch Network co-founder Anton Bukov at the Dutch Blockchain Week. Source: CointelegraphReaching 1.4 billion unbanked users“That’s why we have 1.4 billion people on the planet who are unbanked. No one’s going to invest those hundreds or tens of dollars into them because they will never return to them,” Bukov added. Unlike traditional finance, which has high barriers to entry, Bukov said DeFi allows the unbanked to become a part of the global economy and engage in real-life transactions using stablecoins like Tether’s USDt (USDT). With lower barriers to entry, DeFi becomes a tool for financial inclusion. Bukov said DeFi will continue to reach users who never had access to traditional banking as internet access expands globally. “You can just get a phone, access to the internet, and you can exchange your chicken for USDT,” Bukov said, highlighting how easily DeFi enables participation in the global economy. Related: Animoca’s Yat Siu says student loans can supercharge DeFi growthDeFi allows access to global liquidity Apart from financial inclusion, Bukov said that the real value of crypto lies in how it gives access to global liquidity. The 1inch co-founder said crypto is evolving into an independent economic zone, where hundreds of billions flow through decentralized protocols. “Crypto isn’t just about adopting stablecoins or building national digital currencies,” Bukov said. “It’s a growing global liquidity hub.”He said that this liquidity is dynamic and allows financial experimentation, yield strategies and cross-border capital movement. Bukov added that countries that align their regulations to enable easier access to this global liquidity can tap into economic opportunities and cooperation. “The more countries trade with each other, the more they succeed. Crypto works the same way,” he said. Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/1inch-cofounder-defi-financial-inclusion-dbw-event?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-23T08:25:00.000Z,"Why Tether refuses to comply with MiCA","Is Tether MiCA compliant?              The EU’s new Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation, better known as MiCA, is the first major attempt by a global economic power to create clear, region-wide rules for the crypto space, and stablecoins are a big focus.MiCA mandates best practices. If a stablecoin is going to be traded in the EU, its issuer has to follow some stringent rules:1. You need a licenseTo issue a stablecoin in Europe, you must become a fully authorized electronic money institution (EMI). That’s the same kind of license traditional fintechs need to offer e-wallets or prepaid cards. It’s not cheap and it’s not quick. 2. Most of your reserves have to sit in European banksThis is one of the most controversial parts of MiCA. If you issue a “significant” stablecoin — and Tether’s USDT certainly qualifies — at least 60% of your reserves must be held in EU-based banks. The logic is to keep the financial system safe. 3. Full transparency is non-negotiableMiCA requires detailed, regular disclosures. Issuers have to publish a white paper and provide updates on their reserves, audits and operational changes. This level of reporting is new territory for some stablecoins, especially those that have historically avoided public scrutiny.4. Non-compliant coins are getting delistedIf a token doesn’t comply, it won’t be tradable on regulated EU platforms. Binance, for example, has delisted USDT trading pairs for users in the European Economic Area (EEA). Other exchanges are following suit.The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) clarified that people in Europe can still hold or transfer USDT, but it can’t be offered to the public or listed on official venues. In other words, you might still have USDT in your wallet, but good luck trying to swap it on a regulated platform.                  Key reasons why Tether rejects MiCA regulations              Tether is unique in that it has explained why it wants nothing to do with MiCA regulations. The company’s leadership, especially CEO Paolo Ardoino, has been pretty vocal about what they see as serious flaws in the regulation, from financial risks to privacy concerns to the bigger picture of who stablecoins are really for.1. The banking rule could backfireOne of MiCA’s most talked-about rules says that “significant” stablecoins — like Tether’s USDt (USDT) — must keep at least 60% of their reserves in European banks. The idea is to make stablecoins safer and more transparent. But Ardoino sees it differently.He’s warned that this could create new problems, forcing stablecoin issuers to rely so heavily on traditional banks could make the whole system more fragile. After all, if there’s a wave of redemptions and those banks don’t have enough liquidity to keep up, we’d witness a struggling bank and a stablecoin crisis simultaneously.Instead, Tether prefers to keep most of its reserves in US Treasurys, assets it says are liquid, low-risk and much easier to redeem quickly if needed.2. They don’t trust the digital euroTether also has a broader issue with the direction Europe is heading, especially regarding a digital euro. Ardoino has openly criticized it, raising alarms about privacy. He has argued that a centrally controlled digital currency could be used to track how people spend their money, and even control or restrict transactions if someone falls out of favor with the system.Privacy advocates have echoed similar concerns. While the European Central Bank insists that privacy is a top priority (with features like offline payments), Tether isn’t convinced. In their eyes, putting that much financial power in the hands of one institution is asking for trouble.3. Tether’s users aren’t in Brussels. They’re in Brazil, Turkey and NigeriaAt the heart of it, Tether sees itself as a lifeline for people in countries dealing with inflation, unstable banking systems and limited access to dollars. These are places like Turkey, Argentina and Nigeria, where USDT is often more useful than the local currency.MiCA, with all its licensing hoops and reserve mandates, would require Tether to shift focus and invest heavily in meeting EU-specific standards. That’s something the company says it’s not willing to do, not at the expense of the markets it sees as most in need of financial tools like USDT.Did you know? Turkey ranks among the top countries for cryptocurrency adoption, with 16% of its population engaged in crypto activities. This high adoption rate is largely driven by the devaluation of the Turkish lira and economic instability, prompting citizens to seek alternatives like stablecoins to preserve their purchasing power.                  What happens when Tether doesn’t comply with MiCA              Tether’s decision to skip MiCA didn’t exactly fly under the radar. It’s already having real consequences, especially for exchanges and users in Europe.Exchanges are dropping USDTBig names like Binance and Kraken didn’t wait around. To stay on the right side of EU regulators, they’ve already delisted USDT trading pairs for users in the European Economic Area. Binance had removed them by the end of March 2025. Kraken followed close behind, removing not just USDT but also other non-compliant stablecoins like EURT and PayPal’s PYUSD.Users are left with fewer optionsIf you’re in Europe and holding USDT, you’re not totally out of luck; you can still withdraw or swap it on certain platforms. But you won’t be trading it on major exchanges anymore. That’s already pushing users toward alternatives like USDC and EURC, which are fully MiCA-compliant and widely supported.Even major crypto payment processors are pulling support, leaving users with fewer options for spending their crypto directly.A hit to liquidity? Probably.Pulling USDT from European exchanges could make the markets a bit shakier. Less liquidity, wider spreads and more volatility during big price moves are all on the table. Some traders will adjust quickly. Others? Not so much.Did you know? Tether (USDT) is the most traded cryptocurrency globally, surpassing even Bitcoin in daily volume. In 2024, it facilitated over $20.6 trillion in transactions and boasts a user base exceeding 400 million worldwide.                  Tether vs MiCA regulation              Tether may be out of sync with the EU, but it’s far from retreating. If anything, the company is doubling down elsewhere, looking for friendlier ground and broader horizons.Firstly, Tether’s picked El Salvador as its new base, a country that has fully embraced crypto. After getting a digital asset service provider license, the company is setting up a real headquarters there. Ardoino and other top execs are making the move too.Moreover, after banking over $5 billion in profits in early 2024, Tether is putting its capital to work:AI: Through its venture arm, Tether Evo, the company has picked up stakes in firms like Northern Data Group and Blackrock Neurotech. Tether has also launched Tether AI, an open-source, decentralized AI platform designed to operate on any device without centralized servers or API keys. The goal is to use AI to boost operations and maybe build some new tools along the way.Infrastructure and AgTech: Tether invested in Adecoagro, a company focused on sustainable farming and renewable energy. It’s a surprising move, but it fits Tether’s bigger strategy of backing real-world, resilient systems.Media and beyond: There are also signs Tether wants a footprint in content and communications, signaling it’s thinking far beyond crypto alone.                  Tether’s MiCA exit highlights crypto’s global regulatory chaos              Tether walking away from MiCA is a snapshot of a much bigger issue in crypto: How hard it is to build a business in a world where every jurisdiction plays by its own rulebook.The classic game of regulatory arbitrageThis isn’t Tether’s first rodeo when it comes to navigating regulations. Like many crypto companies, they’ve mastered the art of regulatory arbitrage, finding the friendliest jurisdiction and setting up shop there. Europe brings in strict rules? Fine, Tether sets up in El Salvador, where crypto is welcomed with open arms.However, it does raise questions. If big players can simply move jurisdictions to dodge regulations, how effective are those rules in the first place? And does that leave retail users protected or just further confused?A crypto world that’s all over the mapThe bigger issue is that the global regulatory landscape is incredibly fragmented. Europe wants full compliance, transparency and reserve mandates. The US is still sending mixed signals. Asia is split; Hong Kong is pro-crypto, while China stays cold. Hong Kong has also passed the Stablecoin Bill to license fiat-backed issuers and boost its Web3 ambitions. Meanwhile, Latin America is embracing crypto as a tool for financial access.For companies, it’s a mess. You can’t build for one global market; you must constantly adapt, restructure or pull out entirely. For users, it creates massive gaps in access. A coin available in one country might be inaccessible in another just because of local policy.As a final thought: Tether’s resistance to MiCA seems to be more than just a protest against red tape. It’s making a bet that crypto’s future will be shaped outside Brussels, not inside it.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/why-tether-refuses-to-comply-with-mica?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

It’s an increase of 30% since the start of May as derivatives speculators load up on leverage in anticipation of higher Bitcoin prices.Open interest is the total number of outstanding futures contracts that allow traders to bet on the future price of Bitcoin, which have not been settled or closed, showing the total amount of current market speculation.Total Bitcoin futures OI. Source: CoinglassWhen OI surges, it indicates massive leveraged positions are built up in the market, with lots of traders holding large positions with borrowed money. If Bitcoin’s price moves against these over-leveraged positions, traders get forcibly liquidated, and the flushout can create selling pressure on Bitcoin, which can cause a rapid drop in prices and high volatility.However, analysts suggest the surge in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows, which have seen more than $2.5 billion this week, can counter some of that extended leverage.Related: Crypto perp futures coming ‘very soon,’ says CFTC’s MersingerBitcoin options markets show a similar pattern with open interest over $1.5 billion at the $110,000 and $120,000 strike prices on the Deribit exchange.

2025-05-23T05:11:25.000Z,"Trendspotting in crypto: How to discover winning projects before the crowd","TL;DRSpotting the next big crypto project before it explodes demands data, discipline and a sharp eye for real signals. This guide explores how to identify early winners by analyzing onchain metrics, tokenomics, dev activity and community traction while avoiding the common traps of hype-driven pumps and red-flag projects.Despite the crypto space being crowded, fast-moving and full of noise, some investors manage to consistently find promising projects while they’re still under the radar.So, how do they do it? Crypto trendspotters know how to read onchain data. They understand tokenomics. They read GitHub commits and follow the money. It takes more than jumping on the hype bandwagon ahead of the crowd.This guide breaks down how to find crypto projects with real potential using lessons from past winners like Solana, Arbitrum, Chainlink and even memecoins like Pepe. Along the way, it will highlight the tools that matter, red flags to avoid and the difference between organic growth and manufactured buzz.How the real winners took offSolanaWhen Solana launched in 2020, few outside of developer circles had heard of it. But it had one big edge: speed. Solana’s proof-of-history tech made it one of the fastest chains around, and it quickly became a magnet for builders, especially in DeFi and NFTs. By 2021, its ecosystem exploded with apps like Serum and Magic Eden.Early adopters who paid attention to onchain growth — like wallet activity and DEX volume — could see something brewing. Solana (SOL) went from under $1 to $50+ in less than a year. Arbitrum Arbitrum launched in 2021 as an Ethereum layer 2, but its big moment came with the Arbitrum (ARB) token airdrop in March 2023. At launch, Arbitrum was already processing more transactions than many layer 1s and had billions in total value locked (TVL) in decentralized applications (DApps).Smart investors were watching. Even before the token, the signs were there: user activity, rising liquidity and growing app adoption. When ARB dropped, the pump stuck because the foundation was real.ChainlinkChainlink is a classic example of a project with long-term utility. It doesn’t have flashy branding or meme power, but it does one thing incredibly well: feed real-world data into smart contracts.By 2024, it had become the backbone of much of DeFi, gaming and even tokenized real-world assets. If you were watching closely in 2019-2020, you saw LINK (LINK) getting integrated everywhere. That kind of early utility often flies under the radar — until price action catches up.PEPE Coin (PEPE)Let’s not pretend memes don’t matter. Pepe (PEPE) launched in 2023 with no roadmap, no utility and no VC backing. But it hit a nerve, and the internet ran with it. The coin hit a billion-dollar market cap within weeks.That kind of run is rare — and risky. But for traders tracking social sentiment, wallet distribution and community activity, the early signals were all there. PEPE didn’t promise anything, but it delivered returns by becoming a viral moment.How to find crypto gems earlySo, how do you separate the next Solana from the next rug pull? Here’s how serious trendspotters approach it.1. Start with onchain metricsPublic blockchains are transparent. Use that to look at:Daily active walletsTransaction volumeTokenholder growthLiquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs)TVL (for DeFi projects).If users and capital are moving in — before the token moons — that’s a great sign. Tools like Dune Analytics, Nansen and DefiLlama are your best friends here.2. Understand the tokenomicsAsk questions like:What’s the total supply? How much is circulating?Are there upcoming unlocks or vesting cliffs?Who holds the tokens, and how concentrated are the top wallets?Is there utility? Does the token do anything?Tokens with capped supply, smart incentives (like staking or burn mechanisms) and fair distribution models tend to do better long-term.3. Check developer activityIs the team actually building?GitHub is a goldmine. Look at how often code is pushed, how many contributors are active, and whether the repo looks alive. No updates for months? Big red flag.You don’t need to read code — just track commits and releases. Projects with real traction are always shipping.4. Look for ecosystem signalsAre other developers building on top of it? Are DApps launching? Is liquidity growing? Are users coming back week after week?Ecosystem growth is hard to fake, and it’s often the strongest early indicator that a project has legs.5. Follow the communityX, Discord, Telegram, Reddit — yes, it’s noisy. But it’s also where trends start. Look beyond the price talk:Are people actually using the product?Are devs answering questions?Is the tone constructive or just hype?Use LunarCrush or Santiment to track social momentum, but always double-check it with onchain data.Key tools to spot crypto trendsHere’s a quick rundown of the top platforms used by smart crypto trendspotters:Top tip: Don’t just use one tool. Great traders cross-reference everything.Crypto trend analysis 2025A coin might be flying, but is it because people are actually using it or just talking about it? Learning to tell the difference can save you from making a bad investment. Signs of real tractionSteady user growth and TVL over time: If users are showing up before a token pumps — and the numbers keep climbing week over week — that’s usually a sign of substance. You’ll often see this in DeFi protocols or layer 2s gaining trust slowly, not overnight.Code commits and product updates: A live GitHub with regular commits, active devs and visible progress means the team is building. This shows momentum and long-term focus — not just a marketing push.More tokenholders, less whale control: When new holders join steadily — and supply isn’t all locked up by the top five wallets — it’s a healthier setup. Distributed ownership reduces the risk of rug pulls or coordinated dumps.New integrations and ecosystem activity: If other apps are integrating the token or building on the protocol, it usually means the tech is solid and useful. This kind of network effect compounds fast and often precedes a breakout.Liquidity that builds slowly: Gradual increases in liquidity and trading volume tend to reflect real interest. If liquidity sticks around (rather than vanishing after a pump), it’s usually organic.Signs of manufactured hypeSudden spikes in social mentions or trading volume with no news: If the project is everywhere on X overnight, but there’s no product update, launch or roadmap shift, be skeptical. It’s likely a coordinated shill.Influencer spam and recycled talking points: When you see multiple anonymous influencers posting the same meme or catchphrase, that’s a signal someone’s trying to manufacture buzz.No dev activity or roadmap: If there’s no GitHub, no changelog and the team isn’t shipping anything, it’s probably just a hype machine.Anonymous team, outrageous promises: Combine a mystery team with claims like “100x guaranteed,” and you’re likely looking at a cash grab. Real builders let the work speak for itself.Rule of thumb: If the price is moving and everything else — users, devs, integrations — is standing still, you’re looking at hype. But when those fundamentals are quietly ticking up in the background? That’s when it’s worth a closer look.More red flagsSome projects look great on the surface — slick websites, trending hashtags, a fast-moving chart — but fall apart under the hood. Here are some more red flags to watch out for:High holder concentration: If most of the token is sitting in a handful of wallets, it doesn’t take much for a price crash. Whales often buy early and dump on retail.Unverified token contracts: A token that hasn’t been verified on Etherscan or BscScan might hide functions that allow minting, blocking wallets or draining liquidity. Always check the contract or look for an audit.No liquidity lock or audit: If the devs control all the liquidity provider tokens and there’s no lock or time-locked contract, they can pull the rug at any moment. Similarly, no third-party audit? That’s a gamble.Big token unlocks coming up: Large unlocks for insiders or early investors can trigger huge sell-offs. If you’re holding during a major vesting event, you could be exit liquidity. Know the schedule.Top tip: Before you click buy, ask, Who stands to gain the most if this pumps? Who gets hurt if it dumps? If the answer points to a few insiders with heavy bags and zero accountability, walk away.How to spot crypto trends before the crowdThe best early investors are the mechanics looking under the hood. They study token structures and unlock schedules, join communities early to catch signals firsthand, and follow the builders to see who’s actually shipping. Most importantly, they cross-check everything: on-chain data, social sentiment, developer activity, and liquidity. Tools like Dune, DefiLlama, Nansen and GitHub help them separate noise from substance — and spot winners before the crowd does.Crypto rewards those who are curious, critical and a little bit contrarian. The crowd usually shows up late. If you want to find gems before they moon, you’ll need to think independently, dig deeper, and act before the narrative forms.It’s not easy. But it’s doable. And the more you practice spotting early signals — the real ones, not the noise — the more second nature it becomes.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The proposed amendment would come after 18 Democrats sided with Republicans in the Senate in voting to advance the bill on May 20 after it failed a procedural vote on May 8.“Passing the GENIUS Act without our anti-corruption amendment stamps a Congressional seal of approval on Trump selling access and influence to the highest bidder,” Merkley said in a May 22 X post.Trump his three sons are involved in the crypto platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI), which launched its USD1 stablecoin in March.

Historically, XRP has reacted very positively following those announcements, and the $2.2 billion futures open interest could help catapult XRP price above the current $3.25 all-time high.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

With Bitcoin (BTC) hitting an all-time high, market speculators are banking on eventual capital rotation, which could pump major altcoins like SOL toward new highs.Solana shows promising signs on the daily chart, forming a textbook bull flag pattern after a strong uptrend.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe trend remains bullish, supported by the relative strength index (RSI) at 64.30, indicating healthy momentum without overbought conditions. However, SOL needs a clear market structure break (MSB) or a decisive bullish breakout above $180 to trigger the next leg of the rally. Declining volumes during the consolidation phase suggest caution, as a lack of buying pressure could stall the breakout. If SOL fails to breach $180, the immediate key area of interest is between $140-150, and the bull flag pattern would be invalidated.

2025-05-22T15:00:00.000Z,"Semiconductor exemptions don’t matter when it comes to tariffs","Opinion by: Ahmad Shadid of O.xyzSemiconductors scored a rare exemption from US President Donald Trump’s aggressive reciprocal tariffs, but the relief is symbolic at best. Most semiconductors enter the US embedded in servers, GPUs, laptops, and smartphones. The finished goods remain heavily tariffed, some with duties reaching up to 49%. The exemption looks good politically but delivers little practical benefit. Nvidia’s DGX systems, crucial for training advanced AI models, do not fall under the exempted HTS codes. Nvidia could pay effective tariffs nearing 40% on these vital components. Such costs threaten to stall critical AI infrastructure projects across the country. Semiconductor tariffs may compromise the goal of the CHIPS Act. The act promised tens of billions of dollars in subsidies to support domestic chip manufacturing. Yet advanced lithography machines — key equipment from countries like the Netherlands and Japan — face 20%–24% tariffs. Ironically, tariffs designed to boost American production increase the cost of essential manufacturing equipment.The effect of new tariffs is already slowing progress in critical supply chains — just as generative AI and large language models are gaining momentum across sectors like finance and defense. Any delays or cost increases now could blunt America’s technological advantage.Indirect costs undermine exemptions for AIModern semiconductor supply chains are global and highly integrated. An exemption on raw silicon means nothing when servers, GPUs and other finished products face steep tariffs. Tariffs indirectly inflate costs, eliminating any competitive advantage from domestic manufacturing.Indirect tariff costs hit high-end systems disproportionately hard. The effect ripples through AI model training, data center expansions and major infrastructure projects, significantly slowing the industry’s momentum.Tariff impasse halts investmentSo far, it’s clear that the US president’s tariff plan didn’t follow any conventional economic trends or calculated strategy. The uncertain tariff situation stalls investment decisions across the technology sector. Companies need predictable costs to justify large capital expenditures. Ongoing tariff volatility prevents them from committing resources to new data centers and manufacturing lines.This mirrors the supply chain chaos of 2020. At that time, uncertainty caused massive order cancellations and slowed industry recovery for years. If tariff ambiguity continues, we could see similar waves of cancellations in 2025. This would further compound existing inventory and revenue issues in the semiconductor sector.Domestic production is not optimalThe border argument for these tariffs is that they’re meant to boost domestic production. They do little, however, to encourage genuine domestic semiconductor production. Despite subsidies under the CHIPS Act, most US semiconductor companies still rely on international foundries for manufacturing. Instead, they face increased equipment and operational costs.Recent: How trade wars impact stocks and cryptoThe idea that tariffs promote domestic production ignores the reality of global semiconductor manufacturing. Costs rise across the board, putting American companies at a disadvantage rather than offering protection.AI projects face heightened riskThe blockchain and crypto sectors, particularly AI-driven projects, also feel the pinch. Projects depend heavily on GPUs and high-performance servers for mining, validating transactions and running decentralized AI computations. Increased hardware costs directly affect profitability and growth, potentially stalling innovation in blockchain applications. AI developments have just started to pick up the pace in the blockchain and Web3 space. The industry saw increased interest from investors and VCs just a year ago. So, they are still on tighter budgets. Elevated costs can, however, lead to stagnation. We might see innovators and developers exiting the market. The ripple effect extends beyond the general technology sector and could threaten future digital economies. Moreover, these cost pressures disproportionately affect startups and smaller tech firms. Industry giants can absorb additional expenses, but innovative, smaller players face existential threats. This dynamic risks stifling innovation at the grassroots level, harming the entire tech ecosystem.What to expect Semiconductors have momentarily escaped direct tariffs, but the exemption provides little benefit. Tariffs continue to hit finished products, driving up indirect costs across the industry. Instead of boosting domestic manufacturing, these tariffs create economic paralysis, stall critical infrastructure projects, and threaten America’s lead in AI innovation. Policymakers must acknowledge these realities and adjust their approach before irreversible damage is done to the nation’s technological future.Opinion by: Ahmad Shadid of O.xyz.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-22T13:39:15.000Z,"Exponential currency debasement: ‘You don’t own enough crypto, NFTs’","Cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can help investors protect their eroding purchasing power during an era of exponential currency debasement, according to analysts and industry leaders.Investing in digital assets is becoming increasingly important in the “world of the exponential age and currency debasement,” according to Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Global Macro Investor.“You don’t own enough crypto. When you do, you don’t own enough NFT’s, as art is upstream of wealth. Both will never be this cheap again,” Pal said.NFTs are “the single best long term store of wealth I know and you get to buy it before network effects kick in,” he added in another response.Source: Raoul Pal“There is some validity to the statement that NFTs, and in extension art, become a vehicle for the wealthy once a certain level of wealth is reached,” wrote Nicolai Sondergaard, research analyst at Nansen, calling it a “natural move” for asset diversification.“For traders and investors, further down the wealth curve, NFTs are partially about speculating on future returns,” he told Cointelegraph, adding that NFTs also benefit from the allure of strong communities, beyond just wealth creation.Related: German gov’t missed out on $2.3B profit after selling Bitcoin at $57KArt NFTs may see a resurgence as “digital ownership gains acceptance among younger, tech-savvy cohorts,” if collections manage to move past the “speculative fervor,” according to Anndy Lian, author and intergovernmental blockchain expert.Still, Lian said broader adoption depends on blockchain networks improving scalability and security to “instill confidence.” He added that art NFTs “must transcend hype, anchoring value in cultural significance or utility.”  Beeple’s “Everydays: The First 5000 Days.” Source: ChristiesSome digital artists made millions of dollars through NFTs.

2025-05-22T13:30:00.000Z,"How staking incentivizes trust without burning energy","What if a financial system could run itself not by burning electricity, but by rewarding good behavior? That’s the promise of staking, a mechanism that powers many modern blockchains by turning users into network operators. In this week’s episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Gareth Jenkinson and Nathan Jeffay sit down with StarkWare’s Noam Nisan to unpack how this trustless engine works, why it matters and what’s really at stake.Understanding stakingJeffay began by highlighting how staking is part of the backbone that keeps the blockchain running, and runs itself, with volunteers.“By doing this, they’re saying, OK, we’re taking this task of running the blockchain seriously. Here's some of our money. We're putting it down. We're showing that we're serious about doing this.”To help unpack this topic further and examine the deeper mechanics behind staking, the hosts are joined by Noam Nisan, principal researcher at StarkWare and a widely respected computer scientist who has held roles at Google and Princeton.Related: How to handle crypto trading gains and losses on your balance sheet“So we have this general system with operators... Why would they want to do that? The system, the protocol, incentivizes them to actually run the system,” Nisan explained. “Basically, it can give them tokens for operating the system.”Staking offers what Nisan describes as two distinct types of security: computer science-based guarantees and economic disincentives for bad actors. “If a majority or supermajority, maybe two-thirds of the parties of the token of the staked amount are behaving properly... we can prove that the system acts correctly,” he said. “But you also have what I would call an economic guarantee... if they destroy the system, very likely the value of the token... will go down. So they are the one losing.”PoW vs PoSJenkinson, a vocal Bitcoin (BTC) supporter, posed the classic comparison: proof-of-work vs proof-of-stake. “Do you have any strong feelings about one or the other?” he asked.“The truth is that it’s not clear.. it's really a social question, I think.”Nisan noted that both mechanisms involve trade-offs around cost, control, and decentralization. The episode also explores the role of staking in tokenomics and system design. Nisan unpacks how fee mechanics and inflation controls, such as Ethereum’s minting curve, help keep the ecosystem in balance.To hear the full conversation on The Clear Crypto Podcast,  listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

Fueled by BTC’s rally, several high-risk tokens are posting even larger gains, stoking possibilities that they could continue to outperform Bitcoin as the crypto bull run accelerates.Fartcoin ascending channel hints at more gainsSolana-based Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) memecoin has surged 30% in the last three days to hit $1.57 as of May 22, its highest level in the last four months.The rally extends Fartcoin’s strong year-to-date (YTD) performance—up 74.50%—amid the ongoing memecoin frenzy.

It is, therefore, underperforming Bitcoin on a YTD timeframe but, like WIF, shows the potential of outperforming BTC this cycle in percentage terms.At the core of this bullish outlook is SPX6900’s ongoing bullish reversal attempts.

2025-05-22T12:38:44.000Z,"UK court partially dismisses Bitcoin SV investor’s lawsuit against Binance","The United Kingdom’s Court of Appeal has partially dismissed a lawsuit brought by Bitcoin SV investors against major crypto exchanges, including Binance, for allegedly conspiring to delist the token in 2019.In a judgment handed down on May 21, the court ruled that investors who held BSV through the delisting period (classified as “sub-class B”) were not entitled to billions in speculative damages based on BSV’s hypothetical growth.These investors had claimed over 8.9 billion British pounds ($11.9 billion) in damages, asserting that Binance’s delisting deprived holders of the chance to profit from BSV’s potential rise to a “top-tier cryptocurrency” like Bitcoin (BTC) or Bitcoin Cash (BCH).The court rejected this “foregone growth effect” theory, stating, “BSV was obviously not a unique cryptocurrency without reasonably similar substitutes,” pointing to the representative’s own use of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash as comparators.Sub-class B’s central claim was that delisting led to a missed opportunity to benefit from price appreciation. However, the court determined that those investors had ample chance to mitigate losses by selling or reinvesting in other crypto assets.“They had a duty to mitigate their losses,” wrote Master of the Rolls Sir Geoffrey Vos. “They cannot recover losses that they could reasonably have mitigated.”UK court ruling against Bitcoin SV investor’s lawsuit. Source: CaselawRelated: Bitcoin SV investors attempt to resurrect 2019 Binance lawsuitCourt strikes down “loss of a chance” argumentThe appeal also challenged the Tribunal’s application of the “market mitigation rule,” arguing that such issues should be left for trial.The court dismissed that notion, stating the rule clearly applies to freely tradable assets like BSV, and that the damages must be measured shortly after the delisting.An additional argument concerning the “loss of a chance” to benefit from future price gains was also struck down. The court ruled it “flawed as a matter of principle,” noting that “cryptocurrencies are, by their nature, volatile investments.”Binance’s limited strike-out application ultimately succeeded, with the court stating that even if some holders were unaware of the delisting, “they could never claim more than the total value of their holding before the delisting events plus any quantifiable consequential losses.”Related: Binance wants arbitration for all members of securities class suitBinance seeks to dismiss FTX lawsuitOn May 16, Binance filed a motion to dismiss a $1.76 billion lawsuit filed by the FTX estate, arguing that the claims are legally flawed and an attempt to shift responsibility for FTX’s collapse.The exchange stated the downfall of FTX stemmed from internal fraud, not external manipulation, citing Sam Bankman-Fried’s conviction on multiple fraud charges.Binance has asked the court to dismiss all claims with prejudice.

Obchakevich believes the latest rally “will strengthen confidence in Bitcoin and lead to new injections into the crypto market.” The surge came as Bitcoin set a new all-time high and now trades above $110,000, which Obchavich said will “attract new investors to large funds.” Obchakevich noted that institutional players continue to play a growing role in the digital asset space:“In May, BlackRock became the second largest bitcoin holder after Satoshi Nakamoto, surpassing Binance in this indicator.”Hassan Khan, the CEO of Bitcoin liquidity platform Ordeez, told Cointelegraph that “this is a structural change.” He explained that “Bitcoin is no longer simply a hedge, it’s in the process of becoming a benchmark currency.”Related: Bitcoin 'looks exhausted' as next bear market yields $69K targetThe crypto market approaches new highsAccording to CoinMarketCap data, the total cryptocurrency market cap stood at $3.49 trillion at the time of writing.

Looking into the future, Obchakevich shared his view on Bitcoin’s direction:“We are moving gradually towards $200,000, with gradual adjustments. I am sure that this year we will see Bitcoin at $150,000 and $90,000.“Khan said that “large net inflows to ETFs and increasing open interest demonstrate that institutional confidence is growing.” Looking forward, he said:“Short term profit taking and macro rate uncertainty are tempering momentum.

2025-05-22T10:21:18.000Z,"Can ChatGPT-powered AI agents really trade crypto for you?","Key takeawaysChatGPT-powered AI agents automate trading tasks using natural language prompts and API integrations, improving speed and consistency.Successes occur when ChatGPT is used as a support tool, not a fully autonomous trading system.Failures happen when traders over-rely on ChatGPT without real-time data, proper risk management or manual oversight.Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance.What if a crypto trader didn’t need to constantly check charts, worry about emotions, or stay up all night watching for sudden price swings? What if those tasks could be handled by an intelligent agent that understands instructions in plain English — and reacts within milliseconds? That’s where ChatGPT-powered AI agents come in.These tools combine natural language processing with real-time trading logic to automate decision-making in one of the world’s most volatile markets. From rebalancing portfolios to reacting to market sentiment, ChatGPT is being adapted to act as a trading assistant, risk manager and market analyst — all rolled into one. But can it truly match or even outperform human intuition? This article explores how far these agents have come, where they shine and where they still fall short.How ChatGPT-powered AI agents operate in cryptocurrency marketsChatGPT-powered AI agents are changing how people interact with crypto markets. These tools combine ChatGPT’s language abilities with external trading tools and APIs to help users monitor prices, understand trends and even place trades automatically. Instead of just reacting to charts or numbers, ChatGPT can understand plain language commands like “Buy Ethereum if the price drops below $2,000” or “Sell Bitcoin if RSI goes above 70.”These AI trading assistants can work with major platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, OKX and other centralized or decentralized exchanges and can also tap into decentralized finance (DeFi) tools and smart contracts. With the right setup, ChatGPT can help automate trading strategies based on both technical data and market news.Success stories vs. failures in ChatGPT-powered crypto tradingSome traders have used ChatGPT to assist in automating parts of their crypto trading processes, particularly for strategy generation and sentiment analysis. For example, a user shared on Reddit that they used a ChatGPT-based AI agent for technical analysis on Ether (ETH), feeding it four-hour and daily chart screenshots. By interpreting market sentiment, support and resistance zones, and other indicators, they managed to make $6,500 in profits.Similarly, in the broader crypto sector, ChatGPT has been applied to support project development activities such as drafting white papers and marketing content. A notable example is the launch of the “TURBO” memecoin, which reportedly reached a market capitalization of over $50 million in 2024. In this case, ChatGPT was used to streamline documentation and communication rather than manage trading activity, illustrating its usefulness as a support tool in crypto-related initiatives.However, limitations are evident when ChatGPT is applied beyond its core design. While ChatGPT could suggest a trading portfolio and explain its reasoning clearly, it lacks access to real-time market data and couldn’t respond to sudden volatility. In one instance, ChatGPT was allocated $100 across multiple tokens but failed to actively manage the portfolio as prices fluctuated. This resulted in missed opportunities and underperformance compared to dynamic algorithmic strategies.Individual experiences reinforce these observations. A Redditor exposed a scam where a YouTuber promoted a “ChatGPT trading bot” tutorial that led users to deploy malicious smart contracts. The contracts, generated using ChatGPT and passed off as safe, were designed to drain user wallets once funded. Victims collectively lost $17,240 in ETH, highlighting the danger of blindly trusting AI-generated code without proper auditing.Even when asked, “If I use ChatGPT to build an AI agent for crypto trading, can I become a millionaire?” ChatGPT responded with a realistic outlook — acknowledging that while it’s possible, success depends on having a profitable strategy, disciplined risk management, and the ability to scale effectively.Here is ChatGPT’s response:These cases suggest that while ChatGPT can support certain elements of the trading process, it should not be treated as a standalone solution for autonomous crypto trading.AI in crypto trading: Key benefits and limitationsAI tools like ChatGPT are increasingly being integrated into crypto trading workflows to improve speed, accuracy and efficiency. While they offer important advantages, they also carry specific limitations that traders must actively manage. Below are the main benefits and challenges:Key benefits of using AI for crypto tradingAI bots can execute trades in milliseconds, crucial for capturing opportunities in fast-moving crypto markets.Bots follow pre-programmed rules precisely, eliminating emotional biases that often affect human traders.Crypto markets are always open, and AI bots can monitor and act around the clock without interruption.A single bot can manage multiple trading pairs, exchanges and strategies simultaneously.ChatGPT can understand specific prompts like “Rebalance every Monday” or “Set stop-loss at 5%,” allowing flexible automation.Limitations of ChatGPT in cryptocurrency tradingChatGPT does not access live market data unless specifically integrated with external APIs (e.g., TradingView, CoinMarketCap or exchange websockets).Instructions must be clear and unambiguous; ChatGPT may misinterpret vague or complex commands.Improperly secured API keys or lack of two-factor authentication (2FA) can expose trading accounts to unauthorized access.ChatGPT’s cloud-based infrastructure can introduce latency, which could impact performance during highly volatile periods.ChatGPT does not monitor regional compliance rules; users must manually enforce trading limits based on local regulations.Ethical and regulatory implications of AI in crypto tradingAs AI becomes more integrated into trading systems, it raises significant ethical and regulatory concerns that stakeholders across the financial sector are beginning to address.Accountability: If an AI agent executes a harmful or unlawful trade, questions arise around legal responsibility. It remains unclear in many jurisdictions whether liability falls primarily on the developer, the trader using the AI system or the platform facilitating the transactions.Market manipulation risks: Autonomous AI bots could unintentionally engage in activities such as spoofing (placing and canceling fake orders to mislead the market) or wash trading (creating artificial volume), especially if not properly programmed with compliance safeguards.Regulatory oversight: Financial authorities, including the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the European Securities and Markets Authority, are actively studying the implications of AI and algorithmic trading. These agencies have recognized that traditional trading regulations may not fully account for autonomous decision-making by AI systems.Policy developments: In January 2024, the European Commission released updates to its Digital Finance Strategy, which included references to AI-based financial services. While not yet finalized, these draft regulations under the broader Digital Finance Package signal a move toward stricter compliance expectations for firms deploying AI in financial markets.Meanwhile, ethical crypto platforms are beginning to voluntarily disclose the use of trading bots in their systems. In parallel, open-source communities are advocating for clearer audit trails, improved model transparency and the establishment of ethical guidelines for AI applications in finance to ensure accountability and fairness.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-22T10:02:14.000Z,"Crypto travelers bring 3x greater lifetime value than fiat users","Travelers using cryptocurrency for booking arrangements spend more than twice as much as regular travelers using fiat money, according to a joint report from Binance Pay and crypto travel platform Travala shared with Cointelegraph.Crypto-based bookings on Travala reached $80 million in 2024, up from $45 million the year before. Crypto travelers are also outspending their fiat counterparts, with an average booking value of  $1,211 per transaction, over 2.5 times more than fiat users who spend $469.Additionally, the report said crypto users were three times more valuable over their lifetime due to longer stays and higher repeat bookings, with crypto travelers 57% more likely to make a repeat hotel purchase.Source: Binance Pay, TravalaJuan Otero, CEO of Travala, attributed these travel preferences to the flexible nature of Web3 jobs:“Many also work in the digital asset industry or have flexible, remote work lifestyles, which makes them more likely to travel frequently and stay in one place for longer while seeking out destinations that support seamless, global payments.”Crypto-based transactions have become more common in the travel sector and beyond. Airlines that have integrated digital currencies into their booking systems have seen a 40% boost in bookings, with travel and hospitality representing 14% of all crypto transactions in 2024, according to a Feb. 21 report by Triple-A.Related: Crypto spending will grow, but fiat isn’t going anywhere: Mercuryo CEOThe main benefit of using crypto for travel is its borderless, global utility, Jonathan Lim, the global head of Binance Pay, told Cointelegraph. “Travelers can skip currency exchange lines, avoid foreign transaction fees, and pay instantly using assets they already hold,” he added.A growing number of crypto users also drives the increase in travelers using crypto to pay for trips. Triple-A’s report shows that cryptocurrency ownership has a compound annual growth rate of 99%, significantly outpacing the growth of traditional payment methods. Among crypto owners, 65% express interest in using it for payments.Founded in 2017, Travala is among the most popular crypto-native travel platforms, which enables users to pay for services like flights, hotel stays and tours with 141 different cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC) and USDC (USDC) via Binance Pay. Related: Bhutan launches tourism crypto payments with Binance Pay and DK BankCrypto payment covers more and more retail industriesThe first real-world Bitcoin transaction — 10,000 BTC for two pizzas — occurred 15 years ago today, on May 22, 2010, now commemorated as Bitcoin Pizza Day.

2025-05-22T08:37:57.000Z,"Dubai regulator clarifies real-world asset tokenization rules: Lawyer","Newly updated guidelines from Dubai’s crypto regulator include provisions on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and clarify rules for issuers. On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) released its updated Rulebook for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) operating in the region. The regulator gave market participants until June 19 to comply with the new rules. The regulator previously told Cointelegraph that it had enhanced supervisory mechanisms and brought consistency across activity-based rules. One of the more prominent changes includes regulatory clarity on RWA tokens. Irina Heaver, partner at the United Arab Emirates-based law firm NeosLegal, told Cointelegraph that the updated rules clarify RWA issuance and distribution. “Issuing real-world asset tokens and listing them on secondary markets is no longer theoretical,” Heaver told Cointelegraph. “It’s now a regulatory reality in Dubai and the broader UAE.”A “viable” path to realize RWA hypeHeaver compared RWAs to security token offerings (STOs), an earlier attempt from the crypto space to tokenize securities like stocks, bonds and real estate investment trusts. However, the UAE crypto lawyer said that STOs “died a peaceful death in 2018 to 2019.” The lawyer told Cointelegraph STOs did not work out because of the lack of regulatory clarity, viable secondary market trading venues, institutional investor appetite and liquidity. Still, the situation is different for RWAs. Heaver told Cointelegraph that RWAs are the next foundational layer for institutional adoption of blockchain and virtual assets. Heaver said that VARA’s new rules already cover them as Asset-Referenced Virtual Assets (ARVA) tokens. She said: “VARA’s newly updated Virtual Asset Issuance Rulebook (May 2025) addresses these failures head-on. Regulated exchanges and broker-dealers in Dubai are now authorized to distribute and list ARVA tokens.”The lawyer said this solves an issue in jurisdictions like Switzerland, where token issuance is possible, but listing and secondary trading remain unregulated. Related: Dubai gov’t agencies to link real estate registry with property tokenizationLawyer shares requirements for RWA issuersHeaver said ARVA tokens are defined under Dubai law as representing direct or indirect ownership of real-world assets, granting entitlement to receive or share income and purporting to maintain a stable value by reference to real-world assets or income. ARVA tokens are also backed or collateralised by such real-world assets or constitute a derivative, wrapped, duplicated, or fractionalised version of another ARVA. The lawyer said issuers must meet specific requirements, including a Category 1 Virtual Asset Issuance license, a comprehensive white paper and a risk disclosure statement. In addition, issuers must have a paid-up capital of 1.5 million UAE dirhams (about $408,000) or 2% of reserve assets held. The issuers are also subjected to monthly independent audit obligations and must adhere to ongoing supervisory oversight. “VARA is providing regulatory clarity, and it’s giving the industry a viable, enforceable path to turn the hype of RWA tokenization into reality,” Heaver told Cointelegraph. “This matters because it marks a shift, from theory to execution, from fiction to framework.”Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/dubai-vara-guidelines-rwa-tokenization-clarity?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-22T08:25:00.000Z,"5 red flags you’re being shilled: Don’t buy the hype","What is shilling in crypto?              At its core, shilling is the act of artificially promoting a cryptocurrency or token, often with exaggerated claims, to increase its price or popularity. But what’s the goal? Hype it up, get others to buy in, and then cash out, leaving latecomers holding the bag.Shilling can come from anyone: influencers, anonymous accounts or even high-profile figures with political or financial clout. The common thread is manipulation: It’s not about educating you or building real value but pumping hype for personal gain.Unfortunately, the line between enthusiastic promotion and outright deception can be thin, and many fall victim without realizing it. That’s why it’s critical to learn how to spot the signs early.                  5 red flags you’re being shilled              Beware of crypto red flags like overhyped promises, anonymous teams, influencer shills, missing products and FOMO tactics — if it smells like a scam, it probably is.1. Overhyped promises You’ve probably seen posts that scream:“100x potential!”“Guaranteed returns!”“This is your ticket to financial freedom!”These are classic shill tactics. Real, credible projects don’t promise life-changing profits. Why? Because there are no guarantees in crypto or in any investment.When a project leads with grandiose financial claims rather than actual product value or utility, it’s likely a ploy to stir FOMO and attract unsuspecting investors. The truth is, if something sounds too good to be true, it almost always is.Remember: The bigger the promise, the bigger the red flag.2. Anonymous or suspicious teams In crypto, anonymity isn’t always bad, but when you’re trusting people with your money, transparency matters.It’s a major red flag when a project has:No identifiable team membersFake names or aliasesStock photos on its websiteNo LinkedIn or professional history.The simple rule is “No face, no funds.”Scammers often hide behind anonymity because they know they’ll eventually vanish and there’ll be no one to hold accountable. Even worse, some use fabricated credentials or hire actors to pose as team members.Before investing, check whether the founders or developers have any verifiable history. Do they have prior experience in blockchain or startups? Have they launched anything successful before?3. Influencer spam and paid promotions One day, no one’s talking about a particular coin — the next, your feed is flooded with influencers hyping it up. Sound familiar?This sudden burst of attention is often coordinated with a paid promotion campaign disguised as “genuine enthusiasm.”Many influencers fail to disclose sponsorships, even though it’s required by law in many countries. The US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have cracked down on this in recent years.Take, for example:Kim Kardashian, who was fined $1.26 million in 2022 for promoting EthereumMax without proper disclosure.Floyd Mayweather Jr., who was sued for endorsing the same project at a paid event.BitBoy (Ben Armstrong), who faced legal action in multiple lawsuits for promoting scam tokens to his audience.If you notice multiple influencers promoting the same project in a short time, especially without using labels like #ad or #sponsored, it’s a strong indicator of a shill campaign.Don’t mistake volume for value. Hype doesn’t equal legitimacy.4. No real product or roadmapIf you visit the project’s website, it looks sleek, maybe even impressive. But where’s the product? Where’s the code?Shilled tokens often rely on flashy marketing but have no working application, no GitHub code and no actual use case. Everything is either “coming soon” or buried behind vague promises.Ask yourself:Can I use the platform or app today?Is there a white paper that makes sense?Do they have public repositories or open development?If all you’re seeing is a landing page and a vague roadmap that’s been “coming soon” for months, that’s a major red flag.5. Pressure tactics and FOMO Time pressure is a psychological weapon, and shillers know how to use it.Watch out for lines such as:“Presale ends in 2 hours!”“Only 1,000 spots left!”“If you don’t buy now, you’ll miss out forever!”These tactics prey on your fear of missing out (FOMO) and push you into making impulsive decisions without research.But crypto isn’t a sprint; it’s a long-term game. Anyone trying to rush you into buying likely has something to hide. Solid investments don’t need fake urgency.Take a breath, step back, and ask yourself: Am I buying because I believe in this project or because I’m being manipulated?Did you know? The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) secured a $128-million judgment against Ryan Mitchell Pope, Daniel Samuel Bishop and their company EmpiresX for operating a fraudulent forex and cryptocurrency investment scheme that defrauded over 12,500 victims.                  Is shilling illegal in crypto? Can influencers be sued?              Shilling isn’t just unethical in many cases — it’s also illegal.In the world of crypto, undisclosed promotions are a major legal risk. If someone is paid to promote a token or project but fails to reveal that financial connection, they could face fines, lawsuits or even criminal charges. This is especially true if the promoted token is later classified as a security under US law.Regulators like the SEC, FTC and CFTC have all cracked down on this behavior. Their targets have included:Influencers who failed to disclose paid promotionsPromoters who misled investors with false claimsIndividuals who ran pump-and-dump schemes using social media.Francier Obando Pinillo, a pastor from Miami, was indicted on 26 fraud counts for running a crypto scam through “Solano Fi,” defrauding investors of millions from 2021 to 2023. He allegedly used his church, social media and false promises of 34.9% monthly returns to lure victims. The platform showed fake gains but blocked withdrawals, while funds were diverted for personal use. Pinillo was arraigned in Richland, Washington and faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.As crypto becomes more mainstream, expect stricter regulations and more consequences for shillers.Did you know? Argentine President Javier Milei has dissolved the special task force investigating the LIBRA cryptocurrency scandal, a project he promoted in February 2025 that surged to a $4.5-billion valuation before crashing by over 97%. The task force, created by Milei himself, was disbanded via Decree 332/2025, citing that it had fulfilled its purpose. However, critics argue that no official findings were released, and judicial investigations into Milei and his associates continue.                  How to protect yourself from shilling scams              Do your own research, verify the team and utility, ignore hype and influencers, and stay alert to pump-and-dump schemes to avoid crypto shilling traps.Let’s understand how you can protect yourself from shilling scams in crypto:Do your own research (DYOR): Always research the project, the team behind it and the data supporting the claims. Don’t rely solely on hype or influencer recommendations. Look into onchain data, GitHub activity and the project’s utility to make informed decisions.Verify the team: A legitimate crypto project should have a transparent and credible team. If the developers are anonymous or have no professional profiles (like LinkedIn), that’s a red flag. Always check the team’s past projects and credibility before investing.Look for real utility: Does this project actually solve a problem? A genuine project should have a working product or solution, not just promises. Avoid projects that lack real-world utility or are still in “coming soon” stages for extended periods.Ignore the hype: If a token is suddenly trending on social media or being aggressively promoted, don’t let FOMO influence your judgment. Shillers often rely on emotions to push their agenda, so it’s essential to evaluate projects based on their merits, not just popularity.Stay skeptical of influencers: Influencers with large followings may be paid to promote certain tokens. Before taking their advice, ask yourself, What’s their incentive? Verify the promotion is legitimate and disclosed as paid or sponsored.
