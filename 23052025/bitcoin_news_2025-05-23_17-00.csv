The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Bitcoin dominance resurges as XRP rallies strongly; meanwhile, Unilabs achieves a major milestone in the crypto market. Table of Contents BTC price analysis: Open interest continues Bitcoin dominance Unilabs presale hits jackpot: Crosses $800,000 in stage 2 XRP price rally to $3 at risk? Ripple whales drop holdings Unilabs outperforms Ripple with AI blockchain finance Conclusion According to a senior analyst, BTC has reclaimed its VIP status after closing near its ATH and resuming the ‘Bitcoin dominance’ over other crypto projects. However, the surging XRP price rally hints that Ripple could show a decent debut this cycle. Meanwhile, Unilabs (UNIL) surprises token holders with a marvelous move, raising $800,000 in 2 weeks of going live.

BTC price analysis: Open interest continues Bitcoin dominance Bitcoin (BTC) price has stabilized above $109,000 today, which is just a few inches away from its all-time high of $109,588 from January 20. BTC’s Open Interest (OI) has surged to a new record high of $75.14 billion, maintaining the Bitcoin dominance over other crypto networks. According to Coinglass, the futures’ OI in BTC has reached a new ATH of $75.14 today. Historically, when open interest reached a record high, BTC price generally soared to a new all-time high, as seen in previous bullish cycles. This bullish outlook is because an increasing OI represents Bitcoin dominance and additional money entering the market and new buying, which could fuel BTC to break its ATH of $109,588. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart reads 69, hovering around its overbought level of 70, indicating signs of bullish exhaustion. Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator lines are coiling together, suggesting indecisiveness among traders. The current technical factors suggest continued Bitcoin dominance in Q3 of this year. Unilabs presale hits jackpot: Crosses $800,000 in stage 2 While Bitcoin dominance leads secondary crypto projects in the trillion-dollar crypto market, Unilabs is turning heads with its next-generation DeFi asset management system. This investment protocol presents a sophisticated, technology-driven platform designed to address the typical complexities of the crypto market. Unilabs incorporates advanced AI with the transparent and secure architecture of blockchain finance to democratize access to institutional-grade investment analytics and portfolio management tools. The platform enables retail and institutional investors to maintain an edge over the DeFi ecosystem with enhanced accuracy and confidence. XRP price rally to $3 at risk? Ripple whales drop holdings The recent XRP price analysis showed it’s facing growing downside risks. As of today, Ripple (XRP) is trading at $2.33 amid suppressed price action in the last three days. The broad sideways trading reflects range consolidation in the broader cryptocurrency market, even as Bitcoin (BTC) closes in on all-time highs. As the XRP price broadly consolidates above the short-term support at $2.28, attention is shifting to the XRP Ledger, which is facing declining network activity. The Daily Active Addresses metric in the Ripple chart below shows newly created addresses on the protocol at approximately 33,400, representing a 95% drop from the first quarter peak of roughly 612,000. This sharp decline coincided with the drop in the XRP price from its first-quarter peak of $3.40 to $1.61 amid the tariff-triggered crash on April 7. While the Ripple price recovered, reaching $2.65 on May 12 before sliding to the current market rate of $2.33, engagement remains low based on the diminished number of unique addresses joining the Ripple network. Unilabs outperforms Ripple with AI blockchain finance Unilabs’ fast-growing DeFi network is alerting most Ripple holders as its successful presale debut makes headlines. So far, the platform has raised over $850,000 within two weeks of the presale announcement and sold over 160 million UNIL tokens priced at $0.005 right now. With the current momentum, Unilabs’ presale is poised to complete before the estimated time. As a reward-centric project, Unilabs incorporates a blockchain-based profit-sharing model to distribute the share of gains automatically. Its robust DeFi asset manager pours capital positions, staking yields, and arbitrage wins into one profit pool. Also, the platform is built on the highest security standards to ensure transactions are secure and transparent on the blockchain. Conclusion With the Bitcoin dominance continuation and the XRP price holding a strong position among Ripple investors, Unilabs is well-equipped to shift the spotlight from other networks to its AI-powered DeFi asset management system with over $30.8 million in AUM.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) dropped to $107,300, down by 4.12% from its highest point this week. Similarly, Ethereum ( ETH ) fell by over 8% from its weekly high, while the market cap of all cryptocurrencies, excluding Bitcoin, fell from this week’s high of $1.28 trillion to $1.19 trillion. The ongoing crypto crash coincided with the sell-off in the stock market. Futures tied to the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq 100 fell by over 1%, continuing a sell-off that has been going on since Monday.

In a TruthSocial post , President Donald Trump said that trade talks with the European Union were going nowhere, and warned that the US will apply a 50% tariff on all goods from the region. The statement meant an escalation at a time when market participants have been hoping for a deal between the two allies. Europe has hinted that it will respond by hiking tariffs on US goods, including Boeing jets. In a statement this week, Ryanair’s CEO warned it would consider cancelling a $33 billion order from Boeing and switching to Airbus if Boeing planes were hit with tariffs. Ryanair is Boeing’s biggest customer. These trade concerns are coming a week after Moody’s sent shockwaves in the financial market by downgrading the US credit rating . It also came as the House of Representatives voted for the Big Beautiful Bill that will increase US debt by over $3.8 trillion in a decade. Is this the end of the crypto bull run? This is not the end of the crypto market bull run for three main reasons. First, the 50% tariff on European goods is a negotiating tactic as Trump did with China. After pushing tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%, he pared them back to 30% earlier this month. Second, Bitcoin has become a safe haven asset . Most recently, it outperformed the stock market after the Liberation Day tariffs. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have added over $8 billion in inflows since April. Bitcoin’s appeal as a safe-haven asset is mostly because of its demand and supply metrics. Demand from institutions continues to rise as supply on exchanges and over-the-counter venues continues to fall. Also, Bitcoin has proven itself as a worthy asset in the last 16 years as it jumped from near zero to $111,900 this week. Third, these pullbacks in Bitcoin and altcoins are normal. Just recently, Bitcoin fell from $109,300 in January to $75,000 in April and then bounced back to a record high. In 2024, it peaked at $73,340 in March, fell to $49,390 in August, and rebounded to a record high in November.

If Ethereum’s network activity and total value locked continue to grow, ETH price may see further gains. Ether’s price printed a “bull flag” on the daily chart, a technical chart formation associated with strong upward momentum. Could a strengthening technical setup and increasing transaction fees signal the continuation of ETH’s rally toward $4,000? Ethereum transaction fees rising is bullish Marketwide recovery, fueled by Bitcoin’s rise to new all-time highs and improving macroeconomic conditions, saw Ether’s ( ETH ) price rise by nearly 56% to an eight-week high of $2,734 on May 23, from a low of $1,750 on May 6. This strength in price is reflected in onchain activity, with Ethereum’s daily transaction count rising by 37% over the last 30 days. These levels were last seen in January 2024, when the hype around the approval of US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs pushed ETH price above $4,000 for the first time since December 2021. Ethereum daily transaction count. Source: CryptoQuant Ethereum's daily average transaction fees also skyrocketed, reaching a 90-day high of 0.0005 ETH ($1.33) on May 22. Ethereum: Fee per transaction. Source: Source: CryptoQuant High transaction count and fees suggest that more users are interacting with the network, whether for DeFi, NFTs, or other DApps. It suggests high network activity, often correlating with increased interest and market confidence. Related: Ethereum holders back in profit as ETH price enters 'crucial area' for $3K breakout Historically, Ether’s price has surged during high-usage periods. For example, during the 2021 DeFi boom, fees spiked to as high as 0.015 ETH due to high demand. As such, high utilization periods with high fees indicate growth in network activity or bullish sentiment, as more ETH is needed for gas, pushing its price upward. Increasing TVL supports ETH price bulls The increase in Ethereum’s network activity is also evident when analyzing the total value locked (TVL) on the network’s smart contracts. Ethereum’s TVL has risen to $65.3 billion on May 23 from $45.26 billion on April 22, an increase of over 44% in almost 30 days. Ethereum TVL and transaction count.

The decision came after a favorable ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals, allowing the firm to continue building its Bitcoin treasury. Genius Group Resumes Bitcoin Strategy, Aims for 1,000 BTC After Legal Victory On May 22, the company announced it had added 24.5 Bitcoin to its treasury, increasing its current holdings to 85.5 BTC. The purchase was made at an average price of $99,700 per Bitcoin, bringing the firm’s total Bitcoin investment to $8.5 million. This marks a 40% increase in its holdings since the ruling.

The court stayed a preliminary injunction that had barred Genius Group from using investor funds to purchase Bitcoin. The order, issued on February 14, forced the company to halt its Bitcoin strategy and sell off most of its previous holdings.

That target was first set in November 2024. Before the court-imposed pause, Genius had quickly grown its Bitcoin holdings to 440 BTC by February 2025. During the legal freeze, Genius Group filed an amended RICO lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, seeking damages from what it describes as the “legal actions of third parties” that disrupted its business and forced asset sales. “We are pleased to be able to begin the task of rebuilding shareholder value from the damage caused by the legal actions of third parties,” said Genius Group CEO Roger Hamilton. “Building our Bitcoin Treasury is a key part of that plan.” The company is also moving forward with its educational initiatives, including the launch of its Bitcoin Academy at the end of May. The academy will feature voices from the Bitcoin space such as Saifedean Ammous, author of The Bitcoin Standard. Hamilton said the firm is focused on educating students in what it calls the “ABCs of the Future: AI, Bitcoin and Community,” aligning its vision with the emerging digital economy.

What Traders Need to Know Now appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News When Donald Trump became president of the USA and took a seat at the white house, people thought this year would boost cryptos to amazing prices. But those expectations are basically ruined by trade tensions. In Q1, almost every top crypto fell due to these tensions. However, people thought Q2 would be fruitful, and it was, to some extent, when the US and UK became the first ones to register the deal . The optimism boosted every coin on the planet to some extent, and BTC jumped $112K following this optimism with massive institutional buying. While Ethereum price rose to $2737, and XRP price rose to $2.64, the recent update from Donald Trump’s Truth Social highlights that trade talks with the European Union are “going nowhere”. The harsh statement sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin fell below the $108,500 threshold in a matter of minutes, Ethereum price fell to $2510, and XRP price fell to the $2.31 mark. Many are intrigued to know what happens here onwards, will Q2 see a fall like crypto prices did in Q1, or is it just another bump on the road? Keep reading to know. Trump Will Impose 50% Tariff On June First: Know Why? Trump, in his short but harsh speech, said that the European Union was “established to exploit Americans” and seems solely built to take advantage of the US in Trade. He sounded in the post that he tried, but the European Union was a tough one to deal with. He also says that the EU has trade barriers, unmatched corporate penalties, VAT taxes, and several more issues that have directly led to a humongous amount of trade deficit with the US, which Trump claims to be over $250 billion annually. BREAKING: President Trump announces 50% tariffs on the EU The EU fucked around and found out. pic.twitter.com/79fORjCWsB — Inevitable West (@Inevitablewest) May 23, 2025 Accordingly, he announced that he is strongly in favor of recommending the US to impose a straight increase in taxes to 50%, which will begin on June 1 onwards. He further said that if the EU wanted to build and manufacture in the US, then there would be no tariffs. This sudden hardline stance against Europe is particularly disruptive, given recent efforts to ease trade relations with China, which had provided some stability to global markets. The unexpected shift has now pushed bearish sentiment in the market. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Is Altcoin Season Here? Traders Rotate to XRP, Solana, ADA as Bitcoin Loses Steam , Bitcoin (BTC) A look at bitcoin’s broader trend remains bullish, underpinned by strong support and fundamentals, alongside strong institutional backing. However, in the short term, the price action looks uncertain, as it is exchanging hands at $108716, which is near its all-time high. The price seems to be trying to sustain in the strong supply region. If this breaks, then this supply region will push the price back to $ 100 K. Also, the RSI shows that it is returning from the extreme overbought zone at 68.19, which indicates caution. Ethereum (ETH) At the start of 2025, the ETH price was on a decline, and in Q1 2025, it developed a strong high volume profile level at $2710. In Q2 2025, when the price started rising, this level became a hindrance to its further ascent. Since mid-May 2025, the price of ETH has been trying to jump above it, but has failed due to the absence of strength, and now the increasing tensions with the EU have raised more uncertainty in the short term. If ETH breaks its previous swing low of $2330, then it could fall to take support near $2100 mark. SO one must exercise caution, and avoid FOMO until it breaks the resistance area. XRP (XRP) The XRP price has also taken a hit from the recent Trump action, and fell a few points intraday. At this point onwards, things remain uncertain for XRP as well. If tensions escalate here on, then like any other crypto, XRP will also fall. It has long followed a volume profile level built in Q4 2024, and currently, its price sits at that level. If in the coming days, XRP leaves this level and falls, then $2.06 is the support that needs monitoring; once taken out, the fall could escalate. However, if XRP price takes out this high volume profile level this time, then $3.40 could be the next target. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-23T14:30:04.000Z,"Ethereum Climbs Back To $2,700 – Bulls Ready For A Breakout?","Ethereum continues its strong upward momentum, surging into the $2,734 mark as bullish sentiment returns across the crypto market. After gaining over 55% since the beginning of May, ETH is showing clear signs of strength as it reclaims key technical levels. This move positions Ethereum as one of the most closely watched assets in the market, especially as Bitcoin holds firmly above its all-time highs. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Above $2,500 While BTC Leads the Charge – Key Levels To Watch Top analyst Big Cheds shared a technical view, noting that ETH is now re-approaching the critical $2,700 zone—a level that has historically acted as both resistance and a signal of trend continuation. A successful break and consolidation above this area could unlock the next leg up for Ethereum, potentially bringing higher prices back into focus for traders and investors. The broader sentiment remains optimistic, with bulls increasingly confident that ETH could lead a renewed altcoin rally if momentum sustains. However, analysts also caution that the $2,700 region must be cleared with strong volume and follow-through to confirm a breakout. Until then, Ethereum’s price action remains in a delicate position, teetering on the edge of a major rally or another round of consolidation. Ethereum Facing A Crucial Test Ethereum is positioning itself for a potential bullish recovery as it continues to consolidate above key levels after a multi-week rally. Since early May, ETH has gained over 55% in value, signaling renewed strength in the altcoin market. The recent breakout of Bitcoin to new all-time highs above $111K has triggered optimism across the board, setting the stage for a possible altseason. For that to happen, Ethereum must lead the charge with a clean breakout into higher territory. Currently, ETH is trading just below the $2,700 level, a key resistance zone that has historically acted as a major turning point for price action. According to Cheds, reclaiming $2,700 is crucial. A firm move above this threshold would likely confirm a bullish continuation, opening the door toward the $2,900–$3,000 range. So far, Ethereum has shown resilience, defending the $2,500–$2,600 zone effectively during the recent market consolidation. If bulls maintain control and volume increases, the breakout could materialize sooner rather than later. However, failure to push past $2,700 could trigger a new wave of hesitation, keeping ETH range-bound in the short term. As Bitcoin continues its upward trend, all eyes are now on Ethereum to see whether it can match that strength and lead the broader market higher. Related Reading: Ethereum Addresses In Profit Nearly Doubles Since April Lows – Volatility Returns ETH Price Action Details Ethereum is showing solid bullish structure on the 4-hour chart, consolidating just under the key $2,700 resistance level after a strong rally from early May lows. Price action is currently holding above the short-term exponential moving average (EMA 34) at $2,574, which acts as dynamic support. Meanwhile, the 50, 100, and 200 simple moving averages (SMAs) at $2,543, $2,443, and $2,109, respectively, continue to align in a bullish formation, signaling a healthy trend. Despite some volatility, ETH has consistently defended the $2,650–$2,670 region during recent dips, suggesting strong buyer interest just below resistance. Volume has remained steady, though not aggressive, which implies that bulls are cautiously optimistic while waiting for confirmation of a breakout above the $2,700 level. A decisive candle close above $2,700 could trigger the next leg up, potentially targeting the $2,850–$3,000 range. However, failure to push higher may lead to another test of support at $2,570 or even the $2,540 zone.

2025-05-23T14:30:00.000Z,"Crypto Analyst Issues Bitcoin Alert, Says BTC Dump Incoming if History Repeats Itself – Here Are His Targets","Cryptocurrency analyst Benjamin Cowen is saying that Bitcoin ( BTC ) could be on the verge of a pullback after soaring to new all-time highs. In a new strategy session, Cowen tells his 898,000 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin is on the cusp of forming a golden cross pattern on the daily time frame. A golden cross pattern occurs when a 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average. Cowen says that while the golden cross pattern is typically bullish, it has previously led to Bitcoin “dumps” in the past. “My prior experiences with golden crosses influenced me to think that with a golden cross, you get a correction. We had a correction after the golden cross in 2019, we had one in 2020. We had also had one in 2021… …we also had one after a golden cross in 2015 and that was a much deeper correction.” According to Cowen, Bitcoin could experience a correction of double-digit percentage points after the golden cross pattern forms. “Looking at prior golden crosses… …just noticing that a lot of times you get a golden cross, you get about a 10 to 15% drop.” The widely followed crypto analyst further says, “So my prior experiences with golden crosses with Bitcoin in 2023 had always told me that you rally up by the time you get to the point where you get a golden cross price action has already done very very well, people tend to get euphoric, they start calling for crazier and crazier price predictions in the short term. And then what ends up happening is then Bitcoin gets a pullback. And it keeps those people in check. And it’s just sort of a way of the market… calming down for a little while.” Bitcoin is trading at $110,911 at time of writing.

2025-05-23T14:29:10.000Z,"US DOJ seizes $24M in crypto from accused Qakbot malware developer","The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has filed a civil forfeiture complaint to seize more than $24 million in cryptocurrency from Rustam Rafailevich Gallyamov, a Russian national accused of developing the Qakbot malware. According to a May 22 announcement , the DOJ unsealed charges against the 48-year-old Moscovite with a federal indictment . Gallyamov is allegedly the malware developer behind the Qakbot botnet. “Today’s announcement of the Justice Department’s latest actions to counter the Qakbot malware scheme sends a clear message to the cybercrime community,” said Matthew Galeotti, head of the DOJ’s criminal division. Screenshot of the indictment. Source: US Department of Justice Galeotti highlighted that the DOJ is “determined to hold cybercriminals accountable.” He added that the department will “use every legal tool” to “identify you, charge you, forfeit your ill-gotten gains, and disrupt your criminal activity.” Related: Microsoft takes legal action against infostealer Lumma Over $24 million forfeited US Attorney Bill Essayli for the Central District of California explained that “the criminal charges and forfeiture case announced today are part of an ongoing effort” to “identify, disrupt, and hold accountable cybercriminals.” He added: “The forfeiture action against more than $24 million in virtual assets also demonstrates the Justice Department’s commitment to seizing ill-gotten assets from criminals in order to ultimately compensate victims.” Assistant Director in Charge Akil Davis of the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office said that Qakbot was crippled by the agency and its partners in 2023. Still, Gallyamov allegedly continued deploying alternative methods to offer his malware to potential partners. Related: Chinese printer maker spread Bitcoin stealing malware — Report Qakbot used in global ransomware attacks Gallyamov allegedly operated the Qakbot malware as far back as 2008. In 2019, he allegedly used it to infect thousands of victim computers to establish a so-called botnet. Access to computers that were part of the botnet was sold to others who infected them with ransomware, including Prolock, Dopplepaymer, Egregor, REvil, Conti, Name Locker, Black Bast and Cactus. In 2023, a US-led international operation disrupted the Qakbot botnet and malware . At the time, over 170 Bitcoin ( BTC ) and over $4 million in USDt ( USDT ) and USDC ( USDC ) stablecoins were seized from Gallyamov.

2025-05-23T14:23:08.000Z,"Bitcoin And Ethereum Spot ETFs See Highest Daily Fund Inflows Since January! Here Are The Details","Amid bullish winds in the cryptocurrency market, U.S. spot ETFs based on Bitcoin and Ethereum saw their highest daily inflows since January on Thursday, with a combined net inflow of $1.05 billion. Bitcoin, Ethereum ETFs Record Highest Daily Inflows Since January, Surpassing $1 Billion This strong entry came as Bitcoin reached a new all-time high and Ethereum delivered its best performance in months. On May 22, spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted attention with a total inflow of $934.8 million, which was the highest daily fund flow seen since January 17. BlackRock’s IBIT fund alone accounted for the bulk of the inflows: $877.2 million. Fidelity’s FBTC fund received $48.7 million, and ARK Invest’s ARKB fund received $8.9 million. Other Bitcoin ETFs saw zero inflows on the same day. IBIT has attracted more than $7.7 billion in funds in the past month, making it one of the top five ETFs with the most inflows since the beginning of the year. The fund's assets under management have reached $68.7 billion. In the last seven days, a total of $3.2 billion has flowed into spot Bitcoin ETFs, while the figure has risen to $9.1 billion since the beginning of the year and a cumulative total of $44.6 billion since the launch in January 2024. Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded the highest daily fund flow since February 4, with a net inflow of $110.5 million on the same day. Grayscale’s ETHE fund raised $43.7 million, Fidelity’s FETH product raised $42.2 million, Bitwise’s ETHW fund raised $5.7 million, but some products, including BlackRock’s ETHA fund, saw zero inflows. Ethereum ETFs have been receiving inflows for the last five days in a row. During this period, a total of $211.8 million was attracted, while the net inflow since the beginning of the year reached $61.9 million, and the total cumulative inflow reached $2.7 billion. “Yesterday’s ETF inflows were exceptional. They are well above recent averages and support the bullish trend in the market,” said Valentin Fournier, Research Analyst at BRN. Michael Harvey of Galaxy said that some of this demand is being met through the sale of crypto assets seized by governments and the realization of profits by individual investors, but the real driving factor is 'risk appetite' and institutional purchases. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-23T14:22:21.000Z,"5 Long-Term Cryptos to Buy Now as Ark Invest Raises Bitcoin’s 2030 Bull Case Price to $2.4M","The post 5 Long-Term Cryptos to Buy Now as Ark Invest Raises Bitcoin’s 2030 Bull Case Price to $2.4M appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News ARK Invest’s recent report has triggered a wave of excitement across the crypto market with projections stating that Bitcoin could potentially reach $2.4 million by 2030. This optimistic forecast, which will materialize only through increased institutional adoption, Bitcoin becoming “digital gold,” and its possible ability to swallow a good share from gold’s $18 trillion market cap, has set investors implementing their strategies around it. Therefore, altcoins such as Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and, of course, Rexas Finance (RXS) are drawing attention for their longer-term value. Among all these projects, Rexas Finance is said to be an innovative project that links real-world assets and blockchain technology. Bullish Cardano (ADA) Enters a Breakout Cardano is testing the significant resistance levels after creating a falling wedge pattern, which had in the past set the stage for rallies upward of 300%. Analysts have pointed out that ADA’s previous $0.69 would be a solid support for an upcoming rally toward $2.91. Rising volumes with a breakout beyond $0.72 would give credence to the bullish undertaking. Known for scalable blockchain solutions, Cardano is still very instrumental in decentralized applications and, therefore, will flourish as institutional interest in crypto grows. Dogecoin (DOGE) Eyes a 2024-Style Rally Dogecoin’s recent price action mirrors patterns seen before its 2024 breakout, with the On-Balance Volume (OBV) indicator signaling renewed buying pressure. Analysts note a violation of a declining resistance trendline, historically a precursor to sharp upward moves. While DOGE’s meme-driven origins contrast with projects like Rexas Finance, its loyal community and speculative appeal keep it relevant in a bullish market. Solana (SOL) Targets $200 Amid Ecosystem Growth Solana’s price has surged 51% this month, buoyed by a thriving DeFi ecosystem and $8.54 billion in total value locked (TVL). Technical charts show SOL consolidating within a cup-and-handle pattern, suggesting a breakout toward $200 is likely. With whale activity intensifying and institutional capital flowing into its network, Solana’s high-speed blockchain continues to attract developers and investors. Ripple (XRP) Aims for $5 on Bullish Technicals XRP has climbed 10% in a week, holding above the 50-day EMA at $2.20. A breakout from a falling wedge pattern has analysts like Captain Faibik predicting a 120% rally to $5. Despite delays in spot ETF approvals, XRP’s role in cross-border payments and Ripple’s legal progress keep it in focus. Rexas Finance (RXS) Revolutionizes Real-World Asset Ownership Rexas Finance is transforming how global assets like real estate and gold are traded by enabling fractional ownership through blockchain. Imagine a retail investor in Nigeria owning a 5% stake in a Tokyo office building or a European vineyard—Rexas makes this possible with one click. Rexas Finance empowers users to tokenize assets via its Token Builder and Quickmint Bot, eliminating intermediaries. The Launchpad allows startups to raise funds globally, while Rexas Estate streamlines property investments. Backed by CertiK-audited smart contracts, these tools ensure security and transparency, critical for attracting institutional and retail investors. Presale Momentum and Strategic Vision Rexas Finance has raised $48.5 million in its presale, with 92.5% of allocated tokens sold. Early backers have seen the price climb 6.6x from $0.03 to $0.20, with a confirmed listing price of $0.25 in 2025. Whales are seizing the opportunity— one investor recently purchased 250,000 RXS ($50,000) , signaling strong confidence. The ongoing $1M Rexas Millionaire Giveaway, offering 20 winners $50,000 each, adds urgency for new participants. Listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, Rexas plans to debut on three top-tier exchanges, amplifying its reach. Securing a Position in the Asset Tokenization Wave As ARK Invest’s Bitcoin forecast underscores crypto’s mainstream potential, projects like Rexas Finance redefine value creation. While ADA, DOGE, SOL, and XRP offer speculative upside, RXS stands apart by merging innovation with real-world utility. With the presale’s final stage underway and exchange listings imminent, the window to join this revolution is narrowing. Investors seeking exposure to blockchain’s next frontier—asset tokenization—are turning to Rexas Finance, where trillion-dollar markets meet decentralized efficiency.

2025-05-23T14:20:56.000Z,"Markets correct due to EU tariff fears – Bitcoin falls over 2% and XRP down over 3%","What seemed to be a calm weekend on financial markets has turned into a bloodbath, where the top ten cryptos by market cap, except stablecoins, are now trading in the red over the past hour. Bitcoin dropped below $109,000 minutes after US President Donald Trump threatened to slap the European Union with new tariff rates. Just weeks after “successful talks” with China, the President turned his focus to the EU with an abrupt statement that caused panic across the crypto market. Wow. Trump says EU talks are going nowhere and they will have a 50% tariff starting June 1. pic.twitter.com/94ntHDpEa4 — Geiger Capital (@Geiger_Capital) May 23, 2025 In a Truth Social post published Friday at around 7:00 AM Eastern Time, the US President claimed the bloc has been taking advantage of the United States. “ The European Union… has been very difficult to deal with ,” he wrote. “ Our discussions with them are going nowhere! Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% tariff on the EU, starting on June 1 .” The proposed tariff is more than double the size of the previous 20% levy that was briefly imposed in April but paused for negotiation. The tariff pause is set to expire on July 9, and aside from a new agreement with the United Kingdom, no major progress has been reported in transatlantic trade talks. Crypto assets bleed to tariff threat Bitcoin, which had recently pulled back slightly after setting a new all-time high of $113,000, slumped more than 2.5% in the aftermath of the tariff announcement. The world’s largest crypto fell below the $109,000 mark and is now changing hands at $108,526 at the time of press. XRP investors also saw losses, down over 3.5% on the day. The coin had been consolidating under the $2.6 resistance zone but failed to maintain momentum after the broader market fell apart. 🚨 $XRP : Price Spike Down – 5MIN Chart! #XRP #okx More signals on our Telegram (link in bio)! pic.twitter.com/aWwLPF3spS — Crypto Signals (@crypto_signals) May 23, 2025 Earlier in the day, the coin’s low volatility seemed to be masking an accumulation phase, with analysts mentioning that a successful breach of the $2.6 resistance could drive the price toward $3, but it’s less than likely to happen now. Bullish technical indicators and a flat trend had hinted at an impending rally, but the sudden shock has dragged prices lower. In total, over $500 million in leveraged positions were liquidated in less than 24 hours, according to data from CoinGlass. More than 150,000 traders were impacted, with many positions wiped out in the abrupt correction. Markets correction caused by EU tariff threat According to Michael van de Poppe, founder of MNCapital, the crypto market correction was caused by renewed EU tariff fears. “ Markets correct due to the potential tariffs on the EU ,” he said. “ That provides a dip opportunity on Bitcoin and altcoins. We’ve already seen those panic moments… can provide tremendous returns in the short term .” Among other altcoins in the top ten market cap rank, Ethereum fared almost worst within the hour of the development. Solana had also experienced a rally that saw its price nearly double from a bottom of $95 to reach $186 but is now showing signs of fatigue, falling to $117 at the time of this publication. Meanwhile, in the same social media post recommending a hike in EU tariffs, President Trump demanded Apple and its CEO Tim Cook to bring its iPhone manufacturing operations back to US soil. “ I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the US will be manufactured and built in the US, not India or anyplace else ,” the President said. “ If that’s not the case, a tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple. ” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-05-23T14:20:13.000Z,"Sui blockchain Takes Urgent Action After Cetus Protocol Hack","BitcoinWorld Sui blockchain Takes Urgent Action After Cetus Protocol Hack The world of decentralized finance (DeFi) can be exhilarating, but it’s not without its risks. The recent news of a staggering $223 million hack targeting Cetus Protocol, a prominent decentralized exchange operating on the Sui blockchain , sent shockwaves through the community. In the wake of such a significant security breach, the swift and decisive response from the Sui team has become a critical point of focus. Understanding the Cetus Protocol Hack Before diving into Sui’s response, it’s important to grasp the scale and impact of the incident. The Cetus Protocol hack resulted in the loss of approximately $223 million in digital assets, primarily affecting liquidity providers on the platform. Hacks of this magnitude not only cause immense financial damage to individuals and protocols but also erode trust in the broader DeFi ecosystem and the underlying networks they operate on, like the Sui network . While the exact technical details of the exploit are still being analyzed, the outcome was clear: a massive amount of value was illicitly siphoned away. This event highlighted the persistent vulnerabilities that can exist even on relatively newer and technologically advanced Layer 1 blockchains. How Did the Sui Network Respond? In response to the crisis, the team behind the Sui network took rapid steps. One of the most notable actions was the introduction of a specialized whitelist feature. As reported by Wu Blockchain, this feature is designed to handle specific transactions under emergency conditions. Key Features of Sui’s Post-Hack Response: Whitelist Implementation: A mechanism allowing certain pre-approved transactions to proceed. Security Protocol Bypass: Transactions on the whitelist can reportedly bypass standard security protocols, a measure likely intended to facilitate rapid actions needed for recovery. Restore Module: The introduction of a module with core system privileges, suggesting a powerful tool for system-level operations, potentially related to asset tracing or recovery. Upgraded Transaction Type: A new transaction type added to the whitelist, indicating a specific technical pathway created for handling the post-hack situation. The primary objective behind these measures appears to be the facilitation of fund recovery efforts, specifically aimed at returning stolen assets to the affected liquidity providers on Cetus Protocol. The Rationale: Bypassing Security for Recovery? The decision to implement a whitelist that can bypass standard crypto security protocols is certainly a bold one and warrants discussion. In typical blockchain operations, security protocols are paramount, designed to prevent unauthorized access and malicious activities. However, in the immediate aftermath of a major exploit, traditional security measures, while effective at preventing *new* attacks, might also hinder urgent recovery operations. Tracing stolen funds, freezing specific addresses (if technically feasible and decided upon), or executing complex recovery transactions might require permissions or speed not typically available through standard user transactions. The whitelist, combined with a restore module possessing core system privileges, suggests Sui is using a centralized, emergency override mechanism. This approach prioritizes speed and control in a crisis, allowing the core team or designated entities to perform actions deemed necessary for mitigation and recovery without being slowed down by the very security layers designed for normal operations. Implications for Sui Blockchain and Crypto Security This event and Sui’s response have several implications for the Sui blockchain and the broader landscape of crypto security : Challenges and Considerations: Centralization Concerns: Granting core system privileges and the ability to bypass security protocols, even in an emergency, introduces a degree of centralization. This contrasts with the decentralized ethos of blockchain and DeFi. The community will likely scrutinize how this power is used and governed. Setting Precedent: This action sets a precedent for how emergencies might be handled on the Sui network in the future. Clarity on the conditions under which such measures would be deployed is crucial. Trust and Transparency: While speed is essential, maintaining transparency about the specific actions taken using these elevated privileges is vital for maintaining community trust. Potential Benefits: Faster Recovery Potential: The primary benefit is the potential for a more rapid and effective response to the hack, increasing the chances of recovering some or all of the stolen funds. Demonstrating Responsiveness: The swift implementation shows that the Sui team can react quickly to critical events, which can be positive for confidence in the network’s management. Enhanced Emergency Toolkit: This incident highlights the need for robust emergency response capabilities in blockchain networks, and Sui is developing one such toolset. Lessons from DeFi Exploits The Cetus Protocol hack on Sui is a stark reminder of the persistent risks associated with DeFi exploits . Despite advancements in blockchain technology and smart contract auditing, vulnerabilities can still be found and exploited for massive gains. These incidents underscore several critical points for users, developers, and network operators: Actionable Insights: For Users: Be aware of the risks associated with providing liquidity or interacting with DeFi protocols. Understand that even underlying Layer 1 networks can face challenges that impact protocols built on them. Diversify risk and only invest what you can afford to lose. Stay informed about security incidents on the networks and protocols you use. For Protocols: Continuous, rigorous security audits are non-negotiable. Implement robust monitoring systems to detect suspicious activity early. Develop clear and tested incident response plans *before* a hack occurs. For Networks (like Sui): Invest heavily in network-level security and provide tools and best practices for developers building on the chain. Have emergency response mechanisms, but ensure they are governed transparently and used only under strict, predefined conditions. While the emergency measures on the Sui network might seem like a centralized deviation, they highlight the complex trade-offs networks face when dealing with large-scale DeFi exploits . The balance between decentralization, security, and the ability to respond effectively to crises is an ongoing challenge in the blockchain space. Conclusion The $223 million Cetus Protocol hack was a significant blow to the Sui ecosystem and its users. However, the rapid introduction of a whitelist feature, a restore module, and an upgraded transaction type demonstrates the Sui blockchain team’s commitment to addressing the crisis head-on and attempting to facilitate the recovery of lost funds. While the methods employed involve bypassing standard security layers for emergency control, their effectiveness in aiding recovery efforts will be the ultimate measure of their success. This event serves as a crucial case study in blockchain incident response and the ongoing battle for robust crypto security in the face of sophisticated DeFi exploits .

2025-05-23T14:17:48.000Z,"Ethereum Leads Altcoin Rally with Solana and Dogecoin – Best Crypto to Buy Now","Bitcoin broke all previous records over the past 24 hours, hitting a new all-time high of $111K. This is particularly remarkable if we remember that $BTC was still languishing around $75K in early April. This marks a 50% increase in under two months. $BTC’s newfound momentum seems to have rubbed off on other top cryptos as well, including Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Solana: $ETH is already up 45% in May , currently trading at around $2,570. $SOL is trading at around $177 after a +20% bump this month. $DOGE isn’t far behind, with gains of over 30% ; the coin is now trading at $0.2328. In this article, we’ll go over why Ethereum is at the helm of the current altcoin rally. We’ll also cover the best crypto to buy now to help you make the most of the new altcoin season. Ethereum Leading the Pack Bitcoin briefly brushed past the $109K mark after Trump was announced president. Soon after, though, the excitement died down, tariffs entered the chat, and the broader crypto market went into a sharp downtrend. By early April, Bitcoin plummeted to $75K . However, Christmas came early in May, with a sharp crypto reversal and no signs of stopping anytime soon. Ethereum, not Bitcoin, is at the forefront of this crypto rally, though. $ETH’s daily gains have beaten $BTC’s recently. The number of active daily users on Ethereum DEX has also jumped to 64,000, the highest in three months. What’s more, $ETH’s current DEX volumes of around $15B suggest increasing market participation in the coming months. The Ethereum Foundation has also launched the Trillion Dollar Security initiative, which aims to build a civilization-scale infrastructure. It plans to onboard billions of people, letting them store more than $1,000 on-chain. Institutions and governments could also store up to $1T on a single contract. Security is at the forefront here; the 1TS project will analyze vulnerabilities in Ethereum’s security architecture and build an overview report. High-priority security issues will be addressed to make the security more transparent, further enhancing communication across the Ethereum blockchain. Increasing crypto prices and higher DEX participation are classic indicators of strong bull runs. We might still be sitting at the beginning of what could be a once-in-a-lifetime surge in the crypto market. If you don’t want to sit this one out, here are a few altcoins you can invest in right now to ride the wave. 1. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Best Crypto to Buy Now for Real-Time Crypto Investment Advice MIND of Pepe ($MIND) aims to make profitable crypto investing accessible to everyone. It plans to do so with its own AI agent, which is programmed to identify the best cryptos to invest in on your behalf. The $MIND AI agent is both autonomous and self-evolving, and it works by interacting with the crypto community on X. It first listens to all the unique biases and insights into crypto floating online. Then, it uses AI to join the dots between social trends, market sentiment, and on-chain activity to discover the next cryptos to explode . In addition to $MIND’s real-time, actionable crypto trading plays, you’ll also get early-bird access to the new crypto tokens it creates firsthand. It’s worth noting that time is running out. The presale has already surpassed $10M and will end in seven days. Now’s the moment to buy $MIND and grab the next big crypto coin for a low price of $0.0037515. Learn how to buy $MIND now to benefit from a potential 800% growth in its price in the next five years. 2. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Bitcoin-Inspired Crypto to Buy in 2025 BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) has completely redefined what a Bitcoin-themed meme coin is. Unlike other cryptos that are Bitcoin lovers in name only, $BTCBULL wants to follow the king cryptocurrency through hell and high water. This new crypto is perfect for Bitcoin maximalists who want to make the most of the ‘digital gold rush.’ That’s because in addition to seeing your $BTCBULL investment swell up with rising Bitcoin prices, you’ll also benefit from free $BTC airdrops. Each time Bitcoin crosses a new milestone for the first time (such as $150K or $200K), $BTCBULL holders who have stored their tokens in Best Wallet will automatically receive real $BTC rewards. Additionally, the developers have also planned to scrape off a part of the total BTC Bull Token supply with rising Bitcoin prices. So, every time Bitcoin sees a $50K gain in its price, a $BTCBULL token burn event will occur. Doing so will rapidly reduce the total number of available $BTCBULL tokens in a Bitcoin bull run, which would massively boost its demand and price as investors flock to purchase an altcoin that gives them free $BTC. Luckily for you, BTC Bull Token is currently in presale. It has raised over $6.2M at the time of writing, and you can buy each token for just $0.002525. Here’s how to buy $BTCBULL . 3. Trump Dinner ($DINNER) – Latest Trump-Centric Meme Coin Babe, wake up! Another Trump-based meme coin just launched! Trump Dinner ($DINNER) is the latest example of why betting on Donald Trump’s popularity among crypto degens could be a rather smart financial decision. This top trending crypto is based on a recent announcement on $TRUMP’s official website. It read that the top 220 $TRUMP token holders will be invited to an exclusive dinner gala with the president himself, and that, too, at his private Virginia golf club. What’s more, the top 25 $TRUMP holders will also be invited to an even more exclusive event. They’ll get a ‘special tour’ and ‘private VIP reception with the President.’ As the anticipation for this event builds, the crypto community has responded with $DINNER. This token is fresh off the oven; it launched just a couple of days ago but has already posted brain-melting gains. $DINNER is up over 15,000% since its launch , including a 1,000% gain in just the last 24 hours. This is $TRUMP all over again. The Best Crypto to Buy Now to Ride the Market’s Newfound Enthusiasm The rise of major cryptos like $ETH, $BTC, $SOL, and $DOGE is a telling sign that the coming weeks and months could be prosperous for crypto investors. To make the most of the upcoming rally, consider top altcoins like MIND of Pepe ($MIND) and BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . Bear in mind that the crypto market is highly volatile and unpredictable. One wrong world event could send everything crashing down. We urge you to do your own research before investing.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 480 points, and the benchmark index S&P 500 shed 1% as stocks opened lower amid market reaction. Nasdaq Composite also edged lower, down 1.2%. Having pared gains in recent days, driven by macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns, global stocks looked set to end the week on a losing note as traders weighed the latest tariffs-related move from President Trump. Notably, this comes not long after the United States struck deals with the United Kingdom and China, agreements that sparked upbeat momentum across Wall Street. However, with U.S. deficit jitters rising, stocks are moving from muted returns to broader market worries. You might also like: Dow Jones seesaws, ends flat as Bitcoin hits new all-time high In terms of what Trump has said about the U.S.-EU trade talks, nothing is moving. Basically, with this stalling, he sees the next step as a 50% tariff on the EU. “The European Union, which was formed for the primary purpose of taking advantage of the United States on trade, has been very difficult to deal with. Our discussions with them are going nowhere!” Trump wrote on Truth Social . “Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025. There is no Tariff if the product is built or manufactured in the United States.” While investor attention had shifted from tariffs to U.S. debt deficit and government policy, Trump’s recommendation of a 50% tariff on the EU swings sentiment back to this topic. The U.S. president’s warning that iPhone maker Apple also faces a 25% tariff on iPhones made elsewhere adds to the overall sense that markets may yet suffer pain. Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq are all set to end the week negative, while the Euro and Dollar have also dropped. Meanwhile, while gold was up 1.9% to $3,356, the benchmark cryptocurrency Bitcoin ( BTC ) hovered near $108k, down 2.6%. Bitcoin reached an all-time high above $111.8k this week.

2025-05-23T13:58:49.000Z,"Bitcoin, Hype Hit All-Time Highs, but Trump’s Resumed Tariffs Spark Fresh Concerns: Your Weekly Crypto Recap","After four months of waiting, consolidation, several price crashes and subsequent rebounds, Bitcoin investors finally got what they wanted a few days ago when the asset broke its January all-time high of around $109,100. It wasn’t a smooth journey, nowhere near that. In the past week alone, BTC challenged the $107,000 resistance on a few occasions, but it was stopped and pushed south violently on Monday and Tuesday. However, the bulls were more persistent; they kept driving the cryptocurrency north, and the now former peak gave in on Wednesday. After another unsuccessful attempt during the morning trading session, BTC went hard on the offensive in the afternoon and shot above the previous record. It neared $110,000 but was quickly stopped and dropped by several grand. However, that was another short-term pullback as the bulls returned in full force, pushing the asset past $110,000 and toward a new all-time high of $112,000 (on Bitstamp) registered yesterday – on Bitcoin Pizza Day. The cryptocurrency lost some steam in the following hours but still maintained around $111,000. Then came US President Trump’s renewed tariff warnings. He proposed a 50% straight tax on all countries in the European Union, as the organization had become a bad partner, according to the POTUS. BTC reacted immediately with a price slump of $3,500 but has recovered some ground and now sits close to $109,000. This puts its weekly gains at 5%, which is better than ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, and many others. However, the altcoins have a new superstar in the face of HYPE, which also skyrocketed to a new all-time high earlier today. HYPE has gained more than 30% since this time last week.

Some of the biggest US-based banks, such as JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America, have reportedly teamed up to begin talks on a joint stablecoin, which will allow them to use it to speed up routine transactions like cross-border payments. Bitcoin Rally Is Still Healthy Despite New ATH: On-Chain Data . Although BTC has already broken its all-time high record and sits well in the green on a weekly and monthly scale, several on-chain metrics show that its rally is a lot healthier than the previous surge in January, and it could continue for a while. Is BlackRock’s Spot Bitcoin ETF IBIT Becoming Too Big to Ignore? The biggest BTC ETF continues to eat up its competition as its AUM has grown to more than all other funds combined. This raised questions within the community about whether IBIT could actually pose some centralization issues to an underlying asset that is supposed to be highly decentralized. Profit-Taking Pushes Ethereum (ETH) Into Overheated State Near Key Resistance . ETH has lost some steam after its impressive rally mid-month, but still remains close to a key resistance of around $2,700. The cool-off is probably driven by profit-taking, as this report suggests. Another one, though, indicated that the ETH stored on exchanges has hit a multi-year low, which is typically a bullish sign. CME’s XRP Futures Are Live: A Comparison with BTC, ETH Debuts .

Over $300 million worth of leveraged derivatives positions were liquidated across centralized exchanges in the past four hours, according to CoinGlass data , as crypto prices plunged following the news. Nearly all liquidations came from long positions—traders betting on higher prices. BTC longs accounted for $107 million of the total, while Ethereum's ether ETH followed with close to $87 million. Other tokens, including Solana's SOL SOL, dogecoin DOGE, and SUI SUI saw liquidations ranging between $10 million and $18 million. \""Nice aggregate flush of long leverage and de-risk selling from spot,\"" well-followed crypto trader Skew noted in an X post early Friday. \""All driven by headlines once again.\"" The sell-off came after Trump proposed a 50% tariff on imports from the European Union starting next month, along with a 25% tariff on iPhones manufactured outside the U.S., reigniting fears of an escalating trade war. As a result, BTC and major altcoins such as Ether ETH, XRP XRP, and Cardano ADA fell 3% to 4%, while smaller-cap tokens like Uniswap UNI and SUI SUI dropped 5% to 7% over the past 24 hours. Crypto trader named James Wynn, who gained attention recently opening a $1.1 billion BTC long bet with 40x leverage on the Hyperliquid exchange, also slipped underwater on the massive position. Currently, the trader is sitting on $7.5 million of unrealized losses, and the position could be liquidated if BTC slips to $102,000, according to a screenshot shared on X . Interestingly, the long liquidations came amid a recent unusual tilt toward short positions in BTC derivatives despite record prices, CoinDesk reported on Thursday.

2025-05-23T13:50:31.000Z,"HSBC Tokenized Deposit Service Accelerates 24/7 Corporate Payments in Hong Kong","BitcoinWorld HSBC Tokenized Deposit Service Accelerates 24/7 Corporate Payments in Hong Kong In a significant move signaling the growing convergence of traditional finance and digital assets, global banking giant HSBC has officially launched a groundbreaking service for its corporate clients in Hong Kong. This isn’t just another incremental update; it’s the debut of their blockchain-based HSBC tokenized deposit service, designed to fundamentally transform how businesses handle transactions. This launch represents a tangible step forward in the adoption of distributed ledger technology (DLT) within mainstream banking operations, specifically targeting the efficiency and speed of corporate treasury functions. For businesses operating in Hong Kong and dealing with HKD and USD, this service promises a new era of financial flexibility. Understanding Tokenized Deposits: What Are They? Before diving into the specifics of HSBC’s offering, let’s clarify the concept of Tokenized deposits . Simply put, a tokenized deposit is a digital representation of a commercial bank deposit liability on a distributed ledger or blockchain. Unlike stablecoins, which are often issued by non-banks or backed by reserves held elsewhere, tokenized deposits are direct liabilities of the issuing bank, just like the money you hold in your regular bank account. Think of it as your traditional bank balance, but existing and transferable on a blockchain network. This allows for programmatic settlement, instant transfers, and integration with other digital asset activities, while retaining the regulatory oversight and stability associated with commercial bank money. They are distinct from central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and other forms of cryptocurrencies. Key characteristics of Tokenized deposits often include: Issued by regulated commercial banks. Represent a direct claim on the bank, equivalent to traditional deposits. Operate on a blockchain or DLT platform. Enable faster, potentially 24/7, transfers and settlements. Can be integrated with smart contracts and other digital workflows. HSBC’s Specific Offering: The Hong Kong Edge HSBC’s new service focuses initially on corporate clients within Hong Kong. According to information released by the bank, this service facilitates real-time transfers of tokenized HKD and USD between wallets held by corporate customers directly at HSBC. This is a crucial detail – the transfers occur within the bank’s own ecosystem, which simplifies some of the regulatory and technical complexities associated with interbank transfers. The primary benefit highlighted is the ability to conduct these transfers 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Traditional corporate payments, especially international ones or those involving different banks, are often restricted by banking hours and settlement cycles. This 24/7 availability addresses a major pain point for global businesses operating across different time zones. The service leverages blockchain technology to ensure these transfers are not only real-time but also secure and efficient. By keeping the transfers within the HSBC network initially, the bank can control the environment, manage risks effectively, and provide a seamless experience for participating clients. How Blockchain Powers These Payments At the heart of this innovation are Blockchain payments . While the specific blockchain platform HSBC is using for this service hasn’t been publicly detailed for this specific launch (banks often explore private or permissioned ledgers for such applications), the underlying principles remain consistent with how blockchain enhances payment systems. Here’s how blockchain contributes to the efficiency and effectiveness of these Blockchain payments : Immutability: Once a transaction is recorded on the blockchain, it is extremely difficult to alter, providing a high degree of trust and auditability. Transparency (within the network): While not public like Bitcoin, participants on a permissioned network can have visibility into transactions relevant to them, improving reconciliation. Speed and Efficiency: By removing intermediaries and operating on a distributed ledger, transactions can be processed and settled much faster than traditional systems. Reduced Counterparty Risk: Within a closed loop like HSBC’s internal system, the risk is primarily the bank’s own creditworthiness, which is already inherent in traditional deposits. Automation: The tokenized nature allows for potential integration with smart contracts, enabling automated payments triggered by specific conditions. This use of DLT for Blockchain payments within a controlled banking environment demonstrates a practical application of the technology beyond speculative cryptocurrencies, focusing instead on improving existing financial infrastructure. Unlocking Efficiency: Benefits for Real-time Corporate Payments The introduction of this service brings significant advantages for corporate clients, particularly those requiring swift and flexible payment capabilities. The focus on Real-time corporate payments is a game-changer for treasury and finance departments. Let’s look at some key benefits: 24/7 Availability: As mentioned, the ability to transfer funds at any time, day or night, including weekends and holidays, provides unprecedented flexibility for businesses operating globally or needing to manage urgent payments. Improved Liquidity Management: Real-time visibility and control over funds allow treasurers to manage cash flow more effectively, potentially reducing the need to hold excess liquidity in various accounts. Faster Settlement: Transactions settle instantly between wallets on the platform, eliminating the delays associated with batch processing or traditional correspondent banking. Reduced Costs: While the exact fee structure hasn’t been detailed, DLT-based systems typically have lower operational costs compared to legacy infrastructure, potentially leading to reduced transaction fees for clients over time. Streamlined Reconciliation: The transparency and immutability of the ledger can simplify the reconciliation process, reducing manual effort and errors. Enhanced Operational Efficiency: Faster payments and easier reconciliation free up resources within finance departments, allowing them to focus on more strategic tasks. This move towards Real-time corporate payments via tokenized deposits aligns with the broader industry trend towards faster, more efficient, and always-available financial services. HSBC Tokenized Deposit vs. The Alternatives How does HSBC’s tokenized deposit service stack up against other forms of digital money and payment systems? It’s helpful to draw comparisons: Feature HSBC Tokenized Deposit Traditional Bank Transfer Public Network Cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin) Stablecoin (non-bank issued) Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) Issuer Commercial Bank (HSBC) Commercial Bank Decentralized Network Private Company/Entity Central Bank Liability Direct Bank Liability Direct Bank Liability No Issuer Liability Issuer Liability (depends on backing) Direct Central Bank Liability Underlying Tech Permissioned DLT/Blockchain Traditional Banking Infrastructure Public Blockchain Various Blockchains/DLTs Various DLTs/Platforms Availability 24/7 (within network) Limited by banking hours/cycles 24/7 24/7 Potentially 24/7 Regulatory Status Regulated (as bank deposit) Regulated Varies significantly Varies significantly State-backed/Regulated Primary Use Case Corporate Payments (within bank) General Payments Speculation, Peer-to-Peer (varies) Payments, DeFi Retail/Wholesale Payments (varies) This table highlights that HSBC’s offering is distinct. It leverages DLT like crypto and stablecoins for speed but retains the safety and regulatory framework of traditional bank deposits. It’s a hybrid approach, designed to bring the benefits of digital assets to the established financial system. Challenges and the Road Ahead While the launch of the HSBC tokenized deposit service is a positive step, it’s not without its challenges and limitations. Currently, the service appears limited to transfers between HSBC wallets. Expanding this to interbank transfers or cross-border payments introduces significant complexities, including: Interoperability: Ensuring different banks’ DLT systems can communicate and transact seamlessly. Regulatory Clarity: Developing consistent global regulatory frameworks for tokenized deposits and DLT-based financial instruments. Legal Frameworks: Adapting existing legal concepts of money and ownership to the digital asset space. Adoption: Encouraging widespread adoption among corporate clients and integrating with their existing treasury management systems. Cybersecurity: Ensuring the DLT platform and associated infrastructure are robust against cyber threats. Despite these hurdles, the launch signifies a commitment from a major global bank to explore and implement DLT solutions. The phased approach, starting within the bank’s own network in a specific jurisdiction like Hong Kong, is a common strategy to test and refine the technology before broader rollout. Hong Kong’s Growing Role in Digital Finance The choice of launching this service in Digital currency Hong Kong is also noteworthy. Hong Kong has been actively positioning itself as a hub for digital assets and financial technology. Regulatory bodies have been working on frameworks to accommodate virtual asset service providers and explore the potential of DLT in various financial applications. Initiatives like Project mBridge, a collaboration exploring multi-CBDC cross-border payments involving Hong Kong, further underscore the region’s ambition in the digital finance space. HSBC’s launch contributes to this ecosystem, demonstrating that established financial institutions are embracing digital transformation within the jurisdiction. The move reinforces Hong Kong’s status as a key player in the evolving landscape of Digital currency Hong Kong and Asia’s financial markets. HSBC’s Broader Digital Asset Strategy This tokenized deposit service isn’t happening in isolation. HSBC has been increasingly active in the digital asset space. They have been involved in exploring tokenized bonds, digital asset platforms (like Orion), and participating in various industry initiatives related to DLT and digital currencies. This launch is a natural progression of that strategy, focusing on a core banking product – deposits – and enhancing it with DLT. It reflects a growing understanding within large financial institutions that digital assets and DLT are not just about cryptocurrencies, but about building more efficient, programmable, and interconnected financial infrastructure for the future. What Does This Mean for the Future? The launch of the HSBC tokenized deposit service in Hong Kong is more than just a pilot project; it’s a tangible step towards the future of corporate finance. It signals that major banks are ready to move beyond exploration and begin implementing DLT-based solutions for real-world use cases. While initially limited, the potential for expansion is significant. Imagine a future where: Interbank transfers of tokenized deposits are instantaneous and available 24/7. Cross-border payments are settled in real-time using linked networks of tokenized currencies. Corporate treasury functions are highly automated, with smart contracts managing payments based on real-time data. Integration with other digital assets and platforms becomes seamless. This move by HSBC, a global leader in trade finance and corporate banking, could inspire other institutions to accelerate their own digital asset strategies, particularly concerning tokenized liabilities. It underscores the increasing importance of understanding both traditional finance and the emerging world of digital assets. Conclusion: A Milestone for Digital Finance HSBC’s launch of a tokenized deposit service for corporate clients in Hong Kong marks a significant milestone in the evolution of digital finance. By leveraging blockchain technology, the bank is enabling 24/7, real-time transfers of HKD and USD, directly addressing key inefficiencies in traditional corporate payment systems. This initiative provides tangible benefits like improved liquidity management, faster settlement, and enhanced operational efficiency for participating businesses. Positioned within Hong Kong’s ambitious push to become a digital asset hub, and as part of HSBC’s broader digital strategy, this service highlights the practical application of DLT in enhancing core banking products. While challenges remain, particularly concerning interoperability and broader adoption, this launch is a clear indicator that tokenized deposits are moving from concept to reality, paving the way for a more efficient, always-on financial future for corporate clients and potentially beyond.

2025-05-23T13:48:18.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Pauses Rally, Consolidates Around Recent Highs","Bitcoin’s (BTC) stunning rally is experiencing a pause after shattering the $110,000 level and surging to a new all-time high of $111,970 on Thursday. The rally pushed the flagship cryptocurrency into uncharted waters as it consolidated near record-high levels. BTC is marginally down during the ongoing session, trading around $111,000 after encountering resistance around $112,000. BTC’s rally was fueled by growing investor confidence, institutional interest, and the advancement of a pro-crypto stablecoin bill in the House, fueling hopes for regulatory clarity. Markets Flat As Bitcoin Surges To All-Time High US stocks ended Thursday relatively flat as markets factor in the House’s narrow approval of President Trump’s tax-and-spending package. The S&P 500 dropped 0.04%, while the Nasdaq Composite registered an increase of 0.28%. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded flat. The bill could add $4 trillion to the federal deficit, and includes sweeping tax cuts and substantially increased military spending. The bill passed the House by a single vote after last-minute revisions to include expanded deductions for state and local taxes and now heads to the Senate. Argent Capital’s Jed Ellerbroek discussed the bill, stating, “Short term, the tax bill is good for the economy. But in the longer term, it adds to the deficit, and that’s bad for markets.” Strategy Planning To Sell $2.1B Of Preferred Stock Michael Saylor’s Strategy has announced plans to offer and sell up to 10% of its perpetual Strife preferred stock (STRF). The firm plans to use the proceeds from the sale to expand its Bitcoin holdings beyond the current 576,230 BTC . The offering comes at $0.001 per share, which will allow the company to raise $2.1 billion to fund future Bitcoin acquisitions. Strategy stated in its press release, “The perpetual strife preferred stock, subject to the terms and conditions of the sales agreement, may be sold by agents by any method that is deemed an 'at the market offering.” The firm has been on an aggressive Bitcoin buying spree and revealed its latest acquisition on Monday, announcing the purchase of 7,390 BTC for $764.9 million at an average price of $103,498 per coin. Strategy now holds 576,230 BTC or 2.74% of its total supply. Strategy’s holdings are valued at approximately $64 billion at current prices, representing an unrealized profit of $24 billion. Bitcoin Open Interest Hits Record High Bitcoin futures open interest (OI) hit record levels on crypto derivatives exchanges as traders anticipate the asset will continue its rally. Open interest hit a peak of just over $80 billion on May 23, according to data from CoinGlass, representing a 30% increase since the start of the month. Open interest refers to the total number of outstanding futures contracts that allow traders to bet on Bitcoin’s future price, which have not been settled, indicating the total amount of market speculation. An increase in open interest indicates a build-up of leveraged positions in the market as traders hold positions with borrowed money. If the price moves against these leveraged positions, traders get liquidated, creating a rapid price decline. Bitcoin options markets are demonstrating a similar pattern, with open interest of over $1.5 billion at the $110,000 and $120,000 strike prices at the Deribit exchange. There is also over $1.5 billion in open interest at strike prices of $115,000, $120,000, and $130,000. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) surged past the $110,000 price level, setting a new all-time high of $111,970 on Thursday, fueled by positive macroeconomic developments and the advancement of a pro-crypto stablecoin bill. BTC’s stunning rally has taken a breather over the past 24 hours, as it registered a decline during the ongoing session after encountering resistance around $112,000. The flagship cryptocurrency has entered a price discovery phase as it consolidates around recent highs. Analysts believe the rally will resume after a brief pullback as overall sentiment remains bullish. BTC is stabilizing between $110,000 and $111,000, with bulls eying the $115,000 level as the immediate target. Alankar Saxena, Co-founder and CTO of Mudrex, stated, “Institutional inflows have helped BTC maintain sustained momentum, with Spot ETFs seeing over $600 million in net inflows in a day. Additionally, the US Dollar Index has dropped more than 2.6 percent over the last 10 days, making crypto an attractive hedge against inflation.” BTC could continue its upward trajectory but could also witness a pullback thanks to overbought market conditions. The flagship cryptocurrency registered a notable decline on Monday (May 12), as it started the previous week in the red. The price recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.36% to $104,123, but fell back in the red on Wednesday and settled at $103,568. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $101,459 on Thursday as selling pressure intensified. However, it recovered from this to register a marginal increase and settle at $103,816. Price action turned bearish on Friday and Saturday as BTC registered marginal declines and settled at $103,235. Despite the selling pressure, the price recovered on Sunday, rising over 3% to cross $106,000 and settle at $106,489. Source: TradingView BTC started the current week in the red, facing considerable selling pressure. As a result, the price plunged to an intraday low of $102,135 before recovering to settle at $105,572, ultimately registering a drop of nearly 1%. Despite the negative start to the week, BTC rebounded on Tuesday, rising 1.21% to cross $106,000 and settle at $106,854. The price continued to push higher on Wednesday, rising 2.57% to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,603. Buyers retained control on Thursday as BTC raced to a new all-time high, reaching an intraday high of $111,970 before settling at $111,582. The current session sees BTC down nearly 2%, with buyers losing momentum after encountering resistance around $112,000. The RSI also indicates overbought conditions, so the pullback is along expected lines. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Will the Trump Effect Continue in the Market?","US President Donald Trump continues to influence the cryptocurrency market with his statements. At this point, Trump, who recently made a customs tax statement towards the EU, caused a decline in Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins. Trump's proposal of a 50 percent customs duty on the European Union via his Truth Social account caused BTC to fall by more than 3 percent in a short time. Stating that the EU's primary goal is to take advantage of the United States in trade, Trump accused the EU of using VAT, penalties and currency manipulation to harm American companies. Saying that talks have stalled, Trump proposed a 50% tariff on all EU imports starting June 1, 2025. However, he added that goods produced in the US would be exempt from the tax. “It was very difficult to deal with the European Union, whose primary purpose was to exploit the US's advantage in TRADE. ….Our talks with them are going nowhere! Therefore, I propose a 50% direct Customs Duty on the European Union starting June 1, 2025. No Customs Duty if the product is manufactured or built in the USA.” US President Trump also gave Apple CEO Tim Cook a hard time about the tax. He shared that he clearly told the Apple CEO that all iPhones sold in the US must be manufactured in the US, not in India or other regions. If production is not done properly, Apple will have to pay at least 25% customs duty on each iPhone. Bitcoin, which broke a record yesterday, rose above $111,000 and reached a new ATH, fell to $107,400 after Trump's statements. BTC then recovered somewhat and rose to $108,800. Trump had previously caused a sudden and sharp decline in Bitcoin with his customs duty announcements against different countries such as China. News from both the US-China and US-Russia will determine the direction of Bitcoin and the market in the short term. Experts remind that risky and leveraged transactions should be avoided during these periods. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: What Caused the Sudden Drop in Bitcoin?

2025-05-23T13:30:52.000Z,"Justin Sun: Trump’s Crucial Crypto Embrace Signals Industry Turning Point","BitcoinWorld Justin Sun: Trump’s Crucial Crypto Embrace Signals Industry Turning Point The world of cryptocurrency is always buzzing with news, and recently, a notable figure weighed in on a potentially significant development: the evolving stance of former U.S. President Donald Trump towards digital assets. Tron founder Justin Sun, a prominent voice in the crypto space, has offered a compelling perspective on what this could mean for the industry’s future, particularly regarding Donald Trump crypto engagement and US crypto regulation . Why is Justin Sun Calling This a Turning Point? Speaking after attending a dinner event alongside U.S. President Donald Trump, where the guest list notably included top holders of the TRUMP token , Justin Sun shared his insights. He didn’t hold back, praising the former president’s increasingly pro-crypto posture as nothing short of a ‘game-changing moment’ for the entire industry. According to Sun, critics who dismiss this development are being ‘short-sighted’. For years, the crypto industry has navigated a complex and often uncertain regulatory landscape in the United States. Different government bodies have offered varying interpretations, leading to confusion and, at times, an environment perceived as hostile to innovation. A clear, or at least more favorable, stance from a major political figure like Donald Trump could signal a potential shift in official attitudes, impacting future policy and adoption. What’s Behind the Buzz Around Donald Trump Crypto Stance? Donald Trump’s position on cryptocurrency has seen a notable evolution. Previously, he expressed skepticism about Bitcoin. However, more recently, he has embraced digital assets, even launching his own NFT collections and accepting crypto donations for his campaign. His rhetoric has shifted to being overtly supportive, positioning himself as a champion for crypto against what he portrays as hostile regulatory approaches from political opponents. This change is significant because it brings the conversation about crypto legitimacy and its role in the economy into mainstream political discourse at the highest level. For many in the industry, this political endorsement from a major party figure is seen as a powerful validation, potentially paving the way for clearer, more favorable US crypto regulation in the future, regardless of who occupies the White House. Defending the Realm of Memecoins Beyond the high-level political discussion, Justin Sun also touched upon a more speculative, yet highly popular, corner of the market: Memecoins . Often viewed with skepticism by traditional finance and even some within the crypto community due to their volatility and lack of inherent utility, Sun offered a spirited defense. He argued that memecoins should be recognized as legitimate digital assets. His perspective is that, much like traditional businesses or investments, they involve both inherent risk and potential reward. While their value might be driven primarily by community sentiment, social media trends, and speculation rather than underlying technology or revenue streams, Sun implies this doesn’t inherently disqualify them in the broader digital asset ecosystem. This viewpoint resonates with a segment of the crypto market that sees memecoins as a form of cultural expression, community building, or simply a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity. The rise of tokens like the TRUMP token itself, tied to a political figure and driven by community enthusiasm, exemplifies the unique dynamics of this asset class. Here’s a simple way to look at the memecoin debate: Potential Rewards: High volatility can lead to massive gains in short periods. Community engagement can be strong. Accessibility for new users. Potential Risks: Extreme price swings, high potential for pump-and-dump schemes, value often based purely on speculation, lack of fundamental value, regulatory uncertainty. Is the US Becoming a Crypto Hub Again? Exploring US Crypto Regulation Sentiment Another crucial point raised by Justin Sun is the palpable shift in sentiment among crypto industry players regarding the United States. For a period, many crypto projects and entrepreneurs felt compelled to explore opportunities and establish operations outside the US due to perceived regulatory hurdles and a lack of clear guidance. However, recent signals, including increased political attention and potentially softening stances from some policymakers, are causing many to reconsider. Sun noted that a growing number of crypto participants are now looking at the US with renewed interest, viewing it as a potentially viable, or even attractive, hub for innovation once again. This potential reversal is critical. The US has historically been a leader in technological innovation. If the regulatory environment becomes more predictable and less adversarial, it could unlock significant investment, talent, and development within the country, benefiting the entire global crypto ecosystem. The dialogue around Donald Trump crypto views contributes to this shifting perception, signaling that crypto is becoming a bipartisan issue or at least one where major political figures are actively engaging. What Does This Potential ‘Turning Point’ Mean for You? While it’s too early to declare victory for crypto in the US, the developments highlighted by Justin Sun are undoubtedly significant. A major political figure actively supporting crypto, a defense of diverse digital assets like Memecoins , and a changing perception of US crypto regulation collectively point towards a potentially more favorable environment ahead. For investors, this might mean increased market stability and potentially more institutional adoption if regulatory clarity improves. For developers and entrepreneurs, it could signal new opportunities for building and launching projects within the US. However, it’s essential to remain cautious. Political stances can shift, regulatory processes are slow, and the inherent risks in assets like Memecoins do not disappear with political endorsements. This moment underscores the increasing integration of crypto into mainstream political and economic discussions. Whether you’re interested in the technological advancements, the investment opportunities presented by assets like the TRUMP token , or the broader implications of US crypto regulation , keeping an eye on these developments is crucial. In Summary: Justin Sun views Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance as a significant positive shift. The involvement of figures like Donald Trump crypto signals mainstream political acceptance. Sun defends Memecoins as legitimate assets with inherent risks and rewards. Sentiment regarding US crypto regulation is potentially improving, making the US more attractive for innovation. The future remains uncertain, but the conversation is moving towards greater acceptance and potential clarity. The coming months will reveal whether this moment truly represents a lasting turning point or just another chapter in the volatile history of crypto and its relationship with governments. Regardless, the fact that discussions around Justin Sun ‘s views, Donald Trump crypto positions, TRUMP token popularity, the nature of Memecoins , and the future of US crypto regulation are taking place at this level is a clear indicator of crypto’s growing influence.

2025-05-23T13:30:03.000Z,"Cardano Sees 25% OI Jump In 24 Hours As Bulls Eye Reversal Above $1","Cardano is currently showing a lot of bullish momentum as buyers have been returning to the crypto market. While its price is still below the $1 mark, there have been a lot of activity surrounding the altcoin that could suggest a run-up is on the horizon. These span from rising interest from crypto traders and investors alike, to crypto analysts predicting that technicals are showing a bullish reversal on the chart. Cardano Open Interest Rises 25% One major development for Cardano in the last few days has been the rise in attention that the altcoin has been garnering from the market. This is shown in the steady rise in the open interest of the cryptocurrency over the last few weeks, and culminating in a major jump in a 24-hour period. Data from Coinglass shows that between May 21 and May 22, the Cardano open interest went from $902.27 million to $958.05 million. This meant a 25% increase in the open interest in just a 24-hour period. This is also a long way from the $715.01 million low of May so far, especially as investors have begun to make their bets. Generally, the open interest represents the amount of open futures or options contracts of a particular cryptocurrency. It takes into account the total amount that has been invested in ADA derivatives products at any time, taking both the long and short positions. This means that if the open interest is falling, then crypto traders are placing less bets and if the open interest is rising, then they are taking more positions in the altcoin. As the open interest rises and more bets are placed , it seems that bears are expecting the Cardano price to crash from here. This is shown by the Long/Short ratio which shows 49.71% of all bets are long and 50.29% of bets are long. ADA Breaks Out Of Falling Wedge Pattern After the previous price crash, Cardano fell back into a falling wedge pattern as the altcoin traded in a tight range. Now, as the Bitcoin price has put in a new all-time high and altcoins are falling suit, Cardano is breaking out of this falling wedge pattern. Crypto analyst JimmyX highlighted this in an X post, showing a path for the breakout. The price is already moving toward the first target of $0.9508 after crossing the $0.8 mark. The next two targets for this breakout are $1.0295 and $1.1316.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-sees-25-oi-reversal-1/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Cardano|ADA|ADA news|ADA Price|adausd|ADAUSDT|Cardano news|Cardano Price",cryptocompare

2025-05-23T13:25:29.000Z,"Trump threatens 50% tariff on EU starting June 1 as trade talks stall","President Donald Trump announced Friday that the United States will impose a 50% tariff on all goods imported from the European Union, starting June 1, citing a complete breakdown in negotiations with the 27-member bloc. Trump made the announcement on Truth Social, writing, “I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union,” and claiming that talks have “gone nowhere.” This latest escalation landed less than thirty minutes after Trump also threatened Apple , warning the company it must begin manufacturing iPhones in the United States or face a 25% import tax. “If they are not made in the US, a tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple,” Trump posted . The comment triggered an immediate response from markets — Apple shares dropped 3% in premarket trading, and US stock futures fell across the board, with Dow Jones down 493 points, Nasdaq 100 down 1.7%, and S&P 500 sliding 1.3%. Trump lists grievances as trade officials prepare for face-off In his posts, Trump accused the European Union of building its foundation on exploiting US trade. He claimed the bloc uses tactics such as “Trade Barriers, VAT Taxes, ridiculous Corporate Penalties, Non-Monetary Trade Barriers, Monetary Manipulations,” and lawsuits against American firms, which he said contribute to a $250 billion trade deficit that he called “totally unacceptable.” Trump reiterated, “There is no Tariff if the product is built or manufactured in the United States.” The announcement also created pressure on US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, who is scheduled to meet European Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic later Friday. According to the Financial Times, Greer plans to tell Sefcovic that Brussels’ recent proposals still fail to meet American standards. The EU’s main executive body, the European Commission, declined to comment on the latest developments. Trump’s new tariff recommendation follows an earlier 20% tariff announcement on April 2nd, which he called part of his “reciprocal” policy approach. But Friday’s 50% figure marked a new level, one that some analysts say could destabilize trade if it becomes law. Speaking to CNBC’s Squawk Box , Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said, “To go to 10% was going to be the highest tariff rate that we had on the world in 90 years. To go to 50% is a completely different order of magnitude.” Goolsbee warned that such a decision would likely trigger a stagflationary effect — lowering economic output while raising prices. “That’s the Central Bank’s worst situation,” he said. Bond yields drop and Bitcoin slips after tariff threat As traders rushed to dump risk and move into government debt, bond markets across Europe reacted sharply. The German 10-year bund, widely considered the eurozone’s benchmark for stability, fell 8 basis points to 2.56%. French and Italian bonds also dropped, losing 5 basis points each. Swiss 10-year bonds declined by 12 basis points, reflecting investors seeking safe ground. Commodities and crypto markets didn’t escape either. Bitcoin, which had recently broken above $111,000, pulled back to $108,500. At the same time, gold prices exploded by over 50%, hitting a high of $3,351.15. The US dollar, already under pressure from domestic inflation concerns, slipped 1%, landing at 99.37 by mid-afternoon.

2025-05-23T13:23:59.000Z,"Why Is the Crypto Market Down Today?","The post Why Is the Crypto Market Down Today? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market witnessed a surprising pullback of almost 3% even as Bitcoin (BTC) briefly hit an all-time-high price of $112k . Meanwhile, another cryptocurrency such as Ethereum, XRP, Solana & Dogecoin saw a drop of nearly 3% to 5%. So, what’s driving this crypto market down? Bitcoin’s Drop Starts the Slide Bitcoin, the biggest and most popular cryptocurrency, saw its price fall by 2.6% in just 24 hours. After reaching $112K, it slipped to around $108,460. While this may not sound like a huge drop, it had a strong impact across the market. What triggered this drop was profit-taking. Many investors who had bought Bitcoin earlier chose to sell once it hit the new high. This led to a wave of selling and brought prices down. It’s a common move in the market when people want to secure their profits after a big rally. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Is Altcoin Season Here?

In the last 24 hours, over 163,000 traders lost their positions, adding up to over $544 million in total liquidations. A single trade worth $9.5 million was liquidated on OKX. Long traders, who were betting on prices going up, lost over $400 million. Altcoins Hit Even Harder While Bitcoin dropped, other coins fell even more, Ethereum, the biggest altcoin dropped by 4.3% to $2,541. Meanwhile, XRP, Solana, Cardano, and Tron also faced losses between 1,% and 4%. These coins usually follow Bitcoin’s movement, and this time was no different. Even memecoins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu took a massive hit. Therefore, Dogecoin dropped by 3.9%, Shiba Inu by 3.5%, and a Trump-themed token fell sharply by 13%. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Profit-taking is when investors sell their assets after a price surge to secure their gains, often leading to temporary market pullbacks. What caused Bitcoin’s price to drop from $112K? Profit-taking by investors who bought Bitcoin at lower prices, selling after it hit a new high, triggered the price decline. How did altcoins react to Bitcoin’s price drop? Altcoins, including Ethereum, XRP, Solana, Cardano, and even memecoins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, suffered larger drops (3%-13%) than Bitcoin.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-is-the-crypto-market-down/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|DOGE|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING","News",cryptocompare

Through this groundbreaking partnership, Compass is turning Bitcoin’s computing power, or “hashrate”, into a humanitarian resource: affordable, reliable energy for underserved communities. Through this collaboration with Synota, Compass Mining aims to demonstrate another way the Bitcoin mining industry can contribute directly to energy access, healthcare, and education in underserved communities without leaving the data center. “This is hashrate with heart,” said Paul Gosker , CEO of Compass Mining. “We’re proud to show our customers and the broader industry how Bitcoin mining can improve lives, not just balance sheets.” Under the Impact Mining initiative, Compass Mining has directed some of the output of its mining machines to a Bitcoin mining pool configuration provided by Synota and managed on behalf of Renewvia Solar Africa, an operator of clean energy mini-grids in Africa . The revenue generated by this hashrate is used to offset electricity costs for critical infrastructure in Nigeria . At Oloibiri Hospital , Compass’s contribution is helping cover the monthly power bills. This allows the facility to redirect resources to patient care. Serving over 3,600 patients annually and having delivered over 34,000 babies since 2010, this hospital is now empowered to treat hundreds more. In Ozuzu , a rural village connected to a solar mini-grid in 2021, 150 homes, businesses, and a school are now benefiting from a 20% reduction in power costs thanks to Impact Mining.

2025-05-23T13:19:51.000Z,"Crypto Price Analysis 5-23: BITCOIN: BTC, ETHEREUM: ETH, SOLANA: SOL, RIPPLE: XRP, DOGWIFHAT: WIF, INJECTIVE: INJ","The crypto market’s rally tapered off after Bitcoin (BTC) settled between $110,000 and $111,000. The flagship cryptocurrency shattered its previous all-time high as it surged to $111,970, entering a period of price discovery. However, it registered a decline from this level, ultimately dropping to its current level at around $110,700. BTC is marginally down over the past 24 hours, taking a breather and consolidating around recent highs. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) continued its upward trajectory, with the price up over 2%, trading around $2,690. Buyers will look to retain momentum and push the price above $2,700. Ripple (XRP) also continued its upward trajectory and is up 1.37%, while Solana (SOL) reclaimed $180 with an increase of over 3% in the past 24 hours. Dogecoin (DOGE) , Cardano (ADA) , Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , Polkadot (DOT) , Toncoin (TON) , and Litecoin (LTC) also registered notable increases. Meanwhile, the crypto market cap crossed $3.50 trillion, registering a marginal increase in the past 24 hours. Dow Jones Ends Flat As Bitcoin Surges US stocks registered a mixed performance as markets came to terms with the House’s approval of President Trump’s tax-and-spending package. As a result, the S&P 500 dropped 0.04%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded flat. However, the Nasdaq Composite registered an increase of 0.28%. According to estimates by the Congressional Budget Office, the legislation adds $4 trillion to the federal deficit and includes sweeping tax cuts and increased military spending. The bill passed the House by a single vote after last-minute revisions, including expanded deductions for state and local taxes. The bill will now head to the Senate. Analysts believe weak demand at Wednesday’s 20-year bond auction fueled a sell-off in Treasurys. Additionally, concerns about debt sustainability persist. Argent Capital’s Jed Ellerbroek stated, “Short term, the tax bill is good for the economy. But in the longer term, it adds to the deficit, and that’s bad for markets.” Democrats Propose Crypto Ban For Politicians House Democrats, led by Rep Maxine Waters, have introduced the “Stop Trading, Retention, and Unfair Market Payoffs in Crypto Act of 2025.” The bill aims to prohibit the President, Vice President, members of Congress, and their immediate families from owning, promoting, or profiting from digital assets while in office. It also bars lawmakers from holding crypto assets in ways that allow them to exert unilateral control over the tokens. Rep Waters said in a statement, “Trump’s crypto con is not just a scam to target investors. It’s also a dangerous backdoor for selling influence over American policies to the highest foreign bidder.” The legislation comes amid growing criticism of President Trump’s ties to crypto. Trump and his wife launched meme coins just before the inauguration, while the Trump family is also invested in crypto through World Liberty Financial. Meanwhile, protests erupted outside the venue of President Trump’s high-profile gala for top holders of the TRUMP meme coin. Token holders spent between $55,000 and $38 million in tokens to secure an invitation. Critics have accused Trump of auctioning access to the White House and potentially violating the Constitution’s ban on foreign gifts. Senators Chris Murphy, Elizabeth Warren, and Jeff Merkley, along with Rep. Sam Liccardo, and advocacy groups, have called the upcoming meme coin fundraising dinner a threat to national security and a potential corruption risk. Russian Crypto Miners Post $200M Revenue For FY2024 The Russian crypto mining sector continues to register robust growth, with BitRiver and Intelion, the country’s largest mining firms, reporting $200 million in revenue in FY2024. Data reveals that both firms have captured 50% of the Russian market. Intelion has reported impressive growth, increasing its revenue by RUB 3,948 million ($50,000). Media outlets used the country’s top miners’ latest public declarations to compile the data. The data suggested that Russia’s vast illegal crypto-mining sector was largely unaccounted for. The data also revealed how much power the country’s top crypto miners use. It also shows where the miners have built their biggest data centers and the type of energy mixes used to power their rigs. The data shows that BitRiver reported RUB 10.286 billion (over $129 million) in revenue in 2024 and used 533 MW of power across 15 data centers. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) shattered the $110,000 barrier earlier this week as it surged to a new all-time high of $111,970 on Thursday, losing momentum just short of $112,000. The flagship cryptocurrency seems to be taking a breather as it consolidates around recent highs. BTC’s rally came despite starting the week in bearish territory, as it plunged to an intraday low of $102,135 on Monday before rebounding. BTC faces resistance around the $112,000 level. A break above this level could see the price surge to $115,000 and $120,000. Despite facing selling pressure during the ongoing session, BTC has held above $110,000 as buyers look to consolidate and keep momentum going. Institutional inflows and interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs have also helped BTC sustain its momentum. Alankar Saxena, Co-founder and CTO of Mudrex, stated, “Institutional inflows have helped BTC maintain sustained momentum, with Spot ETFs seeing over $600 million in net inflows in a day. Additionally, the US Dollar Index has dropped more than 2.6 percent over the last 10 days, making crypto an attractive hedge against inflation.” Analysts believe BTC bulls will target the $115,000 level in the near term and attempt to extend the rally to $120,000. However, they also expect a pullback before the rally resumes, thanks to overbought conditions. “A pullback post this is likely given its overbought conditions, though the rally can extend like in December 2024. Market sentiment continues to strengthen with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index climbing to 78 (Extreme Greed).” Additionally, Bitcoin Open Interest (OI) has hit record levels as traders anticipate continued price appreciation in the near term. BTC’s price action was mixed last week as it started in the red before recovering on Tuesday and settling at $104,123. The price was back in the red on Wednesday, falling 0.53% to $103,568. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $101,459 on Thursday as selling pressure intensified. It recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $103,816. The flagship cryptocurrency was back in bearish territory on Friday and Saturday, registering marginal declines to settle at $103,235. However, it recovered on Sunday, rising over 3% to cross $106,000 and settle at $106,489. Source: TradingView BTC started the current week in the red, facing considerable selling pressure. As a result, the price plunged to an intraday low of $102,135 before recovering to settle at $105,572, ultimately registering a drop of nearly 1%. Despite the negative start to the week, BTC rebounded on Tuesday, rising 1.21% to cross $106,000 and settle at $106,854. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as the price registered an increase of 2.57% and settled at $109,603. Buyers retained control on Thursday as BTC rallied to an all-time high of $111,970 before pulling back and settling at $111,582. The flagship cryptocurrency has declined during the ongoing session, with the price down nearly 1%. Analysts expect a pullback due to overbought conditions but expect the rally to resume, with $115,000 the immediate target. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) continued its recovery despite facing selling pressure and volatility as it looks to reclaim $2,700. However, it faces resistance between $2,700 and $2,800. ETH must cross these levels to confirm a push to $3,000. ETH tested key support levels at the beginning of the week, falling to lows of $2,326 and $2,349 on Sunday and Monday. However, it rebounded both times, as bullish sentiment returned following BTC’s stellar performance this week. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is showing strong bullish momentum below the $2,700-$2,800 resistance levels. If the price breaks above these levels, a move to $3,000 becomes a possibility. Despite a lull in the crypto market’s rally, ETH has registered an increase of nearly 2%. ETH started the previous week in the red, registering a marginal decline before rising over 7% on Tuesday and settling at $2,681. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and fell nearly 3% on Wednesday to settle at $2,610. Bearish sentiment persisted on Thursday as ETH dropped 2.38%, slipping below $2,600 and settling at $2,548, but not before hitting an intraday low of $2,749. ETH attempted a recovery on Friday, rising to an intraday high of $2,648. However, it could not stay at this level and fell to $2,537, ultimately registering a marginal decline. Selling pressure intensified on Saturday as the price fell 2.44%, slipping below $2,500 and settling at $2,475. Source: TradingView ETH faced selling pressure and volatility on Sunday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. The price ultimately registered an increase of nearly 1% and settled at $2,498. ETH plunged to an intraday low of $2,349 on Monday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to register an increase of 1.18% and settle at $2,527. The price registered a marginal decline on Tuesday before rising 1.10% on Wednesday and settling at $2,552. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as ETH registered an increase of over 4% to reclaim $2,600 and settle at $2,664. The current session sees ETH marginally down as sellers look to lower the price while buyers look to move it beyond $2,700. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) crossed $180 during the ongoing session as it tested the resistance between $180 and $185. SOL’s price action has been exceptional over the past month, rising over 21% as it sets its sights on $200. SOL started the previous week positively and registered a substantial increase of 5.50% on Tuesday to cross $180 and settle at $183. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped nearly 4% on Wednesday, slipping below $180 and settling at $176. Sellers retained control on Thursday as the price fell over 4% to $169. SOL attempted a recovery on Friday but was unsuccessful, ultimately registering a drop of nearly 1% and settling at $167. Selling pressure persisted on Saturday as SOL fell 0.89% and settled at $165. Source: TradingView Despite the overwhelming bearish sentiment, SOL rebounded on Sunday, rising over 4% to reclaim $170 and settle at $173. However, it was back in the red on Monday, dropping to an intraday low of $159 before settling at $166, ultimately registering a decline of nearly 4%. SOL recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.05% to $168. The price continued to push higher on Wednesday, crossing $170 and settling at $173. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as SOL registered an increase of 3.51% and settled just shy of the $180 mark. The current session sees the price up nearly 3%, with SOL having crossed $180 and trading around $184. Buyers will look to retain control and push the price towards $200. Ripple (XRP) Price Analysis Ripple (XRP) was back in the spotlight after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed the reviews for spot XRP ETF applications. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart announced the delays, stating, “As expected, more delays on crypto ETFs dropped today. Delays include Bitwise Invest & CoinsShares XRP ETFs. Delay on Litecoin ETF Filing, Delay on Fidelity’s In-Kind Bitcoin filing. On the more positive side, SEC acknowledged Canary Fund’s staked TRX filing.” The news weighed on XRP as the token traded sluggishly compared to other altcoins. XRP registered a stunning rally last Monday, rising nearly 8% to $2.54. The price continued to push higher on Tuesday despite selling pressure, increasing 1.53% to $2.58. XRP lost momentum after reaching this level, dropping 1.20% on Wednesday and 6.51% on Thursday to slip below $2.50 and settle at $2.38. Price action remained bearish on Friday, registering a marginal decline to $2.37. Sellers retained control on Saturday, and XRP fell 1.04% to $2.35. Source: TradingView Despite the selling pressure, XRP rebounded on Sunday, rising over 3% and settling at $2.42.

CZ refutes claims in latest WSJ article on Trump-linked crypto dealings Binance co-founder and former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has pushed back against a report in The Wall Street Journal, calling it a “hit piece” filled with inaccuracies and negative assumptions. In an X post, Zhao criticized the publication’s portrayal of his alleged involvement with World Liberty Financial, the decentralized finance project backed by a business entity affiliated with US President Donald Trump. Trump’s sons — Eric and Donald Jr. —are involved in the management of the company. Zhao said the WSJ article portrayed him as acting as a “fixer” for the WLF team and its co-founder Zach Witkoff during foreign trips. The article suggested Zhao facilitated introductions and meetings for WLF leaders during foreign trips, including a visit to Pakistan that reportedly resulted in a memorandum of understanding with a local official. “I am not a fixer for anyone,” Zhao said, firmly denying that he connected Pakistani official “Mr. Saqib” with WLF or organized any engagements abroad. “They had known each other way back, whereas I only met with Mr. Saqib for the first time in Pakistan.” Source: Changpeng Zhao Crypto perp futures coming “very soon” to US: CFTC’s Mersinger Outgoing Commodities and Futures Trading Commission Commissioner Summer Mersinger said on May 22 that the regulator could greenlight crypto perpetual futures contracts “very soon.” “We’re seeing some applications, and I believe we’ll see some of those products trading live very soon,” she told Bloomberg TV, adding it would be “great to get that trading back onshore in the United States.” Summer Mersinger on Bloomberg TV. Source: YouTube Crypto perpetual futures are derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate, often with high leverage, on the price of a cryptocurrency without actually owning it and can be held indefinitely. Mersinger, who will leave the CFTC at the end of May to join the crypto lobby group the Blockchain Association as CEO, said having crypto derivatives trading and regulated in the US would be a “really good thing for these markets and would be really beneficial to the industry broadly.” Senators plan to amend GENIUS Act to address Trump family's stablecoin Though a majority of members of the US Senate voted to advance a bill to regulate payment stablecoins on May 20, high-ranking Democrats are planning to propose an amendment to the legislation to address President Donald Trump’s connections to the cryptocurrency industry. According to a May 22 Axios report, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senators Elizabeth Warren and Jeff Merkley will file an amendment to the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act, or GENIUS Act, to block a US president from profiting from stablecoins. The proposed amendment would come after 18 Democrats sided with Republicans in the Senate in voting to advance the bill on May 20 after it failed a procedural vote on May 8. “Passing the GENIUS Act without our anti-corruption amendment stamps a Congressional seal of approval on Trump selling access and influence to the highest bidder,” Merkley said in a May 22 X post. Trump and his three sons are involved in the crypto platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI), which launched its USD1 stablecoin in March.

2025-05-23T14:20:00.000Z,"What is DNS hijacking? How it took down Curve Finance’s website","Understanding the Curve Finance DNS hijacking              On May 12, 2025, at 20:55 UTC, hackers hijacked the “.fi” domain name system (DNS) of Curve Finance after managing to access the registrar. They began sending its users to a malicious website, attempting to drain their wallets. This was the second attack on Curve Finance’s infrastructure in a week.Users were directed to a website that was a non-functional decoy, designed only to trick users into providing wallet signatures. The hack hadn’t breached the protocol’s smart contracts and was limited to the DNS layer.The DNS is a critical component of the internet that functions like a phonebook. It allows you to use simple, memorable domain names (such as facebook.com) instead of complex numerical IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1) for websites. DNS converts these user-friendly domain names into the IP addresses computers require to connect.This is not the first time Curve Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, has suffered such an attack. Back in August 2022, Curve Finance faced an attack with similar tactics. The attackers had cloned the Curve Finance website and interfered with its DNS settings to send users to a duplicate version of the website. Users who tried using the platform ended up losing their money to the attackers. The project was using the same registrar, “iwantmyname,” at the time of the previous attack.                  How attackers execute DNS hijacking in crypto              When a user types a web address, their device queries a DNS server to retrieve the corresponding IP address and connect to the correct website. In DNS hijacking, fraudsters interfere with this process by altering how DNS queries are resolved, rerouting users to malicious sites without their knowledge.Fraudsters execute DNS hijacking in several ways. Attackers might exploit vulnerabilities in DNS servers, compromise routers, or gain access to domain registrar accounts. The objective is to change the DNS records so that a user trying to visit a legitimate site is redirected to a fake, lookalike page containing wallet-draining code. Types of DNS hijacking include:Local DNS hijack: Malware on a user’s device changes DNS settings, redirecting traffic locally. Router hijack: Attackers compromise home or office routers to alter DNS for all connected devices. Man-in-the-middle attack: Intercepts DNS queries between user and server, altering responses on the fly. Registrar-level hijack: Attackers gain access to a domain registrar account and modify official DNS records, affecting all users globally.Did you know? During the Curve Finance DNS attack in 2023, users accessing the real domain unknowingly signed malicious transactions. The back end was untouched, but millions were lost through a spoofed front end.                  How DNS hijacking worked in the case of Curve Finance              When attackers compromise a website with DNS hijacking, they can reroute traffic to a malicious website without the user’s knowledge. There are several ways DNS hijacking can occur. Attackers might infect a user’s device with malware that alters local DNS settings, or they may gain control of a router and change its DNS configuration. They may also target DNS servers or domain registrars themselves. In such cases, they modify the DNS records at the source, affecting all users trying to access the site.In the case of Curve Finance, the attackers infiltrated the systems of the domain registrar “iwantmyname” and altered the DNS delegation of the “curve.fi” domain to redirect traffic to their own DNS server. A domain registrar is a company authorized to manage the reservation and registration of internet domain names. It allows individuals or organizations to claim ownership of a domain and link it to web services like hosting and email.The precise method of the breach is still under investigation. By May 22, 2025, no evidence of unauthorized access or compromised credentials was found.Did you know? DNS hijacking attacks often succeed by compromising domain registrar accounts through phishing or poor security. Many Web3 projects still host domains with centralized providers like GoDaddy or Namecheap.                   How Curve Finance responded to the hack              While the registrar was slow to respond, the Curve team took measures to deal with the situation. It successfully redirected the “.fi” domain to neutral nameservers, thus taking the website offline while efforts to regain control continued. To ensure safe access to the frontend and secure fund management, the Curve team quickly launched a secure alternative at “curve.finance,” now serving as the official Curve Finance interface temporarily.Upon discovering the exploit at 21:20 UTC, the following actions were taken: Users were immediately notified through official channelsRequested the takedown of the compromised domainInitiated mitigation and domain recovery processesCollaborated with security partners and the registrar to coordinate a response.Compromise of the domain notwithstanding, the Curve protocol and its smart contracts remained secure and fully operational. During the disruption of the front end, Curve processed over $400 million in onchain volume. No user data was at risk, as Curve’s front end does not store any user information.Throughout the compromise, the Curve team was always available through its Discord server, where users could raise issues with them.After implementing immediate damage control measures, the Curve team is now taking additional steps to prepare for the future.Assessing and enhancing registrar-level security, incorporating stronger protections and exploring alternative registrarsInvestigating decentralized front-end options to eliminate dependence on susceptible web infrastructurePartnering with the broader DeFi and Ethereum Name Service (ENS) communities to advocate for native browser support for “.eth” domains.Did you know? Unlike smart contract exploits, DNS hijacks leave no trace onchain initially, making it hard for users to realize they have been tricked until funds are gone. It is a stealthy form of crypto theft.                  How crypto projects can deal with DNS hijacking vulnerability              The Curve Finance attack is concerning because it bypassed the decentralized security mechanisms at the protocol level. Curve’s backend, meaning its smart contracts and onchain logic, remained unharmed, yet users lost funds because they were deceived at the interface level. This incident underscores a significant vulnerability in DeFi. While the backend may be decentralized and trustless, the front end still depends on centralized Web2 infrastructure like DNS, hosting and domain registrars. Attackers can exploit these centralized choke points to undermine trust and steal funds. The Curve attack serves as a wake-up call for the crypto industry to explore decentralized web infrastructure, such as InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Ethereum Name Service (ENS), to reduce reliance on vulnerable centralized services.To address the gap between decentralized backends and centralized frontends, crypto projects must adopt a multi-layered approach. Here are various ways crypto projects can deal with this gap:Minimize reliance on traditional DNS: They can minimize reliance on traditional DNS by integrating decentralized alternatives of DNS like the ENS or Handshake, which reduce the risk of registrar-level hijacks. Use decentralized file storage systems: Hosting frontends on decentralized file storage systems such as IPFS or Arweave adds another layer of protection.Implement domain name system security extensions (DNSSEC): Teams should implement DNSSEC to verify the integrity of DNS records and prevent unauthorized changes. Secure registrar accounts: Registrar accounts must be secured with strong authentication methods, including multifactor authentication (MFA) and domain locking. Train users: Educating users to verify site authenticity, such as bookmarking URLs or checking ENS records, can reduce phishing success rates. Bridging the trust gap between decentralized protocols and centralized interfaces is essential for maintaining security and user confidence in DeFi platforms.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-dns-hijacking-how-it-took-down-curve-finances-website?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Cetus’ recovery plan on Sui mirrors a Solana blueprint","The bounty offer to recover stolen funds from Sui-based decentralized exchange (DEX) Cetus closely resembles a successful strategy used by a Solana project three years ago.It turns out that Cetus shares the same development team as Crema Finance, a Solana-based DeFi project that suffered a $9-million hack in 2022 but recovered most of the funds by negotiating with its hacker. Now, Cetus is relying on the same strategy.Cetus is asking the hacker to return all but $6 million, or 2,324 Ether (ETH), of the stolen funds in exchange for a promise not to pursue legal action. The protocol lost $223 million to an exploit on May 22.The size of the bounty has sparked backlash from users, with many calling for a formal compensation plan instead. Several community members argue that even if funds are recovered, most of the damage has already been done — especially to holders of the CETUS token, which plummeted in value following the incident.Meanwhile, Sui validators are also under fire for their role in freezing the funds. The move is aimed at aiding recovery, yet critics say it exposes centralization risks in the network.CETUS immediately dropped around 35% following the hack.

The Solana project hasn’t posted on its X account since March 2023, and its trading platform now sees negligible volume, but it still didn’t end well for the hacker.Crema suffered an approximately $9-million hack in 2022.

Around $63 million had already been bridged to Ethereum before these controls were implemented.Although the coordinated effort has been effective in preventing the funds from being laundered, the cryptocurrency community has criticized Sui for being too centralized.“SUI’s validators are colluding to CENSOR the hacker’s TXs right now! Does that make SUI centralized? The short answer is YES; what matters more is why?

The code was ultimately not merged and is not live on the network.SUI’s price has also been damaged by the Cetus exploit.

With CETUS tanking, trust fractured and validators freezing funds, critics are asking whether Sui’s decentralization is more appearance than reality.The debate over decentralization isn’t unique to Sui. When Bybit lost $1.4 billion in a February hack linked to North Korean state actors, security experts and users urged platforms like THORChain and eXch to block the funds. In that case, THORChain received some backlash for not stepping in, which is the exact opposite of what Sui is being criticized for now.As of now, the hacker hasn’t accepted Cetus’ offer.

Meanwhile, across the Capitol, Representative Tom Emmer reintroduced the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, backed by bipartisan support.Breaking down GENIUSThe GENIUS Act — short for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act” — seeks to answer foundational questions around stablecoin issuance and oversight.“It defines this idea of a payment stablecoin,” explained Rashan Colbert, director of US policy at the Crypto Council for Innovation, in this week’s interview. Colbert emphasized that the bill doesn’t stop at definitions. “It outlines in a robust way just who’s allowed to do this and what they need to look like.” By this, he’s referring to guidelines on who can be permitted issuers like bank subsidiaries, credit unions and approved non-bank entities.Related: Interest groups, lawmakers to protest Trump’s memecoin dinnerThis bipartisan momentum seen backing the GENIUS Act is both exciting and significant. “There has been latent support within Congress, including within the Democratic caucus,” Colbert said. “They just haven’t had the opportunity to take meaningful votes.”Blockchain dev protectionOn the House side, the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, co-sponsored by Representatives Emmer and Ritchie Torres, aims to give legal clarity to developers and service providers who don’t custody customer funds.“It clarifies that they are not money transmitters,” said Colbert. “That’s the clarity these builders and entrepreneurs need to continue operating successfully.”With crypto adoption on the rise — particularly among minority communities — Colbert said the pressure is on. “Something like one in five Americans hold crypto. That number is even larger in the Black, Latino and Asian-American communities,” he noted.Looking ahead, the push toward broader market structure reform will be more complex. Colbert’s advice? Get involved. “It really is, at the end of the day, the people making their voices heard,” he said. “Crypto is a big deal — and Capitol Hill is finally starting to listen.”Listen to the full episode of Byte-Sized Insight for the complete interview on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

Instead, Bitcoin collateral will remain under full custody by Ledn or one of its designated funding partners. “This means assets aren’t rehypothecated, reused, or loaned out to generate yield,” Ledn co-founder and CEO Adam Reeds told Cointelegraph. Reeds said the move brings the company back to its roots and aligns more closely with Bitcoin’s founding principles.“Bitcoin was created as a direct response to the risks of fractional reserve banking and unchecked use of client assets to generate interest,” said Reed, adding:“Traditional finance relies on constantly reusing client assets to create leverage and, ultimately, inflation. Bitcoiners instinctively reject that model. That’s why we’ve moved away from this approach entirely. Reed told Cointelegraph that the company is ending support for Ether (ETH) as “part of a broader strategic shift,” as Bitcoin represents over 99% of Ledn’s client activity. “Rather than fragmenting the platform to chase marginal volume, we’re going all-in on Bitcoin and simplifying our stack to reflect what our clients actually value,” said Reed.Founded in 2018, Ledn has emerged as one of the largest lenders in the digital asset space with a loan book value of $9.9 billion, according to Galaxy Research. The company enables Bitcoin holders to borrow against their assets, giving them access to liquidity without having to sell their holdings or trigger a taxable event.This approach is commonly used by wealthy investors, who take out low-interest loans against stocks, real estate, and other assets to access cash.Bitcoin’s price has reached new all-time highs above $111,000.

2025-05-23T08:47:40.000Z,"DeFi near-zero onboarding costs can help 1.4B unbanked: 1inch co-founder","Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms have a major cost advantage over traditional banks when it comes to onboarding new users, according to Anton Bukov, co-founder of decentralized exchange (DEX) 1inch.Speaking at a panel during Dutch Blockchain Week on May 22 in Amsterdam, Bukov said traditional banks spend between $100 and $300 per user to verify documents and set up accounts. Online banks, he said, spend about $20 to $30. In contrast, DeFi requires almost nothing beyond a smartphone and internet access.“Onboarding to DeFi literally costs zero,” Bukov said. “You don’t need brick-and-mortar infrastructure or lengthy verification processes. Just connect and transact.” Bukov said that this gives DeFi an edge over traditional financial institutions in reaching the 1.4 billion unbanked people who remain excluded from traditional finance due to high onboarding expenses.1inch Network co-founder Anton Bukov at the Dutch Blockchain Week. Source: CointelegraphReaching 1.4 billion unbanked users“That’s why we have 1.4 billion people on the planet who are unbanked. No one’s going to invest those hundreds or tens of dollars into them because they will never return to them,” Bukov added. Unlike traditional finance, which has high barriers to entry, Bukov said DeFi allows the unbanked to become a part of the global economy and engage in real-life transactions using stablecoins like Tether’s USDt (USDT). With lower barriers to entry, DeFi becomes a tool for financial inclusion. Bukov said DeFi will continue to reach users who never had access to traditional banking as internet access expands globally. “You can just get a phone, access to the internet, and you can exchange your chicken for USDT,” Bukov said, highlighting how easily DeFi enables participation in the global economy. Related: Animoca’s Yat Siu says student loans can supercharge DeFi growthDeFi allows access to global liquidity Apart from financial inclusion, Bukov said that the real value of crypto lies in how it gives access to global liquidity. The 1inch co-founder said crypto is evolving into an independent economic zone, where hundreds of billions flow through decentralized protocols. “Crypto isn’t just about adopting stablecoins or building national digital currencies,” Bukov said. “It’s a growing global liquidity hub.”He said that this liquidity is dynamic and allows financial experimentation, yield strategies and cross-border capital movement. Bukov added that countries that align their regulations to enable easier access to this global liquidity can tap into economic opportunities and cooperation. “The more countries trade with each other, the more they succeed. Crypto works the same way,” he said. Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/1inch-cofounder-defi-financial-inclusion-dbw-event?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-23T08:25:00.000Z,"Why Tether refuses to comply with MiCA","Is Tether MiCA compliant?              The EU’s new Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation, better known as MiCA, is the first major attempt by a global economic power to create clear, region-wide rules for the crypto space, and stablecoins are a big focus.MiCA mandates best practices. If a stablecoin is going to be traded in the EU, its issuer has to follow some stringent rules:1. You need a licenseTo issue a stablecoin in Europe, you must become a fully authorized electronic money institution (EMI). That’s the same kind of license traditional fintechs need to offer e-wallets or prepaid cards. It’s not cheap and it’s not quick. 2. Most of your reserves have to sit in European banksThis is one of the most controversial parts of MiCA. If you issue a “significant” stablecoin — and Tether’s USDT certainly qualifies — at least 60% of your reserves must be held in EU-based banks. The logic is to keep the financial system safe. 3. Full transparency is non-negotiableMiCA requires detailed, regular disclosures. Issuers have to publish a white paper and provide updates on their reserves, audits and operational changes. This level of reporting is new territory for some stablecoins, especially those that have historically avoided public scrutiny.4. Non-compliant coins are getting delistedIf a token doesn’t comply, it won’t be tradable on regulated EU platforms. Binance, for example, has delisted USDT trading pairs for users in the European Economic Area (EEA). Other exchanges are following suit.The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) clarified that people in Europe can still hold or transfer USDT, but it can’t be offered to the public or listed on official venues. In other words, you might still have USDT in your wallet, but good luck trying to swap it on a regulated platform.                  Key reasons why Tether rejects MiCA regulations              Tether is unique in that it has explained why it wants nothing to do with MiCA regulations. The company’s leadership, especially CEO Paolo Ardoino, has been pretty vocal about what they see as serious flaws in the regulation, from financial risks to privacy concerns to the bigger picture of who stablecoins are really for.1. The banking rule could backfireOne of MiCA’s most talked-about rules says that “significant” stablecoins — like Tether’s USDt (USDT) — must keep at least 60% of their reserves in European banks. The idea is to make stablecoins safer and more transparent. But Ardoino sees it differently.He’s warned that this could create new problems, forcing stablecoin issuers to rely so heavily on traditional banks could make the whole system more fragile. After all, if there’s a wave of redemptions and those banks don’t have enough liquidity to keep up, we’d witness a struggling bank and a stablecoin crisis simultaneously.Instead, Tether prefers to keep most of its reserves in US Treasurys, assets it says are liquid, low-risk and much easier to redeem quickly if needed.2. They don’t trust the digital euroTether also has a broader issue with the direction Europe is heading, especially regarding a digital euro. Ardoino has openly criticized it, raising alarms about privacy. He has argued that a centrally controlled digital currency could be used to track how people spend their money, and even control or restrict transactions if someone falls out of favor with the system.Privacy advocates have echoed similar concerns. While the European Central Bank insists that privacy is a top priority (with features like offline payments), Tether isn’t convinced. In their eyes, putting that much financial power in the hands of one institution is asking for trouble.3. Tether’s users aren’t in Brussels. They’re in Brazil, Turkey and NigeriaAt the heart of it, Tether sees itself as a lifeline for people in countries dealing with inflation, unstable banking systems and limited access to dollars. These are places like Turkey, Argentina and Nigeria, where USDT is often more useful than the local currency.MiCA, with all its licensing hoops and reserve mandates, would require Tether to shift focus and invest heavily in meeting EU-specific standards. That’s something the company says it’s not willing to do, not at the expense of the markets it sees as most in need of financial tools like USDT.Did you know? Turkey ranks among the top countries for cryptocurrency adoption, with 16% of its population engaged in crypto activities. This high adoption rate is largely driven by the devaluation of the Turkish lira and economic instability, prompting citizens to seek alternatives like stablecoins to preserve their purchasing power.                  What happens when Tether doesn’t comply with MiCA              Tether’s decision to skip MiCA didn’t exactly fly under the radar. It’s already having real consequences, especially for exchanges and users in Europe.Exchanges are dropping USDTBig names like Binance and Kraken didn’t wait around. To stay on the right side of EU regulators, they’ve already delisted USDT trading pairs for users in the European Economic Area. Binance had removed them by the end of March 2025. Kraken followed close behind, removing not just USDT but also other non-compliant stablecoins like EURT and PayPal’s PYUSD.Users are left with fewer optionsIf you’re in Europe and holding USDT, you’re not totally out of luck; you can still withdraw or swap it on certain platforms. But you won’t be trading it on major exchanges anymore. That’s already pushing users toward alternatives like USDC and EURC, which are fully MiCA-compliant and widely supported.Even major crypto payment processors are pulling support, leaving users with fewer options for spending their crypto directly.A hit to liquidity? Probably.Pulling USDT from European exchanges could make the markets a bit shakier. Less liquidity, wider spreads and more volatility during big price moves are all on the table. Some traders will adjust quickly. Others? Not so much.Did you know? Tether (USDT) is the most traded cryptocurrency globally, surpassing even Bitcoin in daily volume. In 2024, it facilitated over $20.6 trillion in transactions and boasts a user base exceeding 400 million worldwide.                  Tether vs MiCA regulation              Tether may be out of sync with the EU, but it’s far from retreating. If anything, the company is doubling down elsewhere, looking for friendlier ground and broader horizons.Firstly, Tether’s picked El Salvador as its new base, a country that has fully embraced crypto. After getting a digital asset service provider license, the company is setting up a real headquarters there. Ardoino and other top execs are making the move too.Moreover, after banking over $5 billion in profits in early 2024, Tether is putting its capital to work:AI: Through its venture arm, Tether Evo, the company has picked up stakes in firms like Northern Data Group and Blackrock Neurotech. Tether has also launched Tether AI, an open-source, decentralized AI platform designed to operate on any device without centralized servers or API keys. The goal is to use AI to boost operations and maybe build some new tools along the way.Infrastructure and AgTech: Tether invested in Adecoagro, a company focused on sustainable farming and renewable energy. It’s a surprising move, but it fits Tether’s bigger strategy of backing real-world, resilient systems.Media and beyond: There are also signs Tether wants a footprint in content and communications, signaling it’s thinking far beyond crypto alone.                  Tether’s MiCA exit highlights crypto’s global regulatory chaos              Tether walking away from MiCA is a snapshot of a much bigger issue in crypto: How hard it is to build a business in a world where every jurisdiction plays by its own rulebook.The classic game of regulatory arbitrageThis isn’t Tether’s first rodeo when it comes to navigating regulations. Like many crypto companies, they’ve mastered the art of regulatory arbitrage, finding the friendliest jurisdiction and setting up shop there. Europe brings in strict rules? Fine, Tether sets up in El Salvador, where crypto is welcomed with open arms.However, it does raise questions. If big players can simply move jurisdictions to dodge regulations, how effective are those rules in the first place? And does that leave retail users protected or just further confused?A crypto world that’s all over the mapThe bigger issue is that the global regulatory landscape is incredibly fragmented. Europe wants full compliance, transparency and reserve mandates. The US is still sending mixed signals. Asia is split; Hong Kong is pro-crypto, while China stays cold. Hong Kong has also passed the Stablecoin Bill to license fiat-backed issuers and boost its Web3 ambitions. Meanwhile, Latin America is embracing crypto as a tool for financial access.For companies, it’s a mess. You can’t build for one global market; you must constantly adapt, restructure or pull out entirely. For users, it creates massive gaps in access. A coin available in one country might be inaccessible in another just because of local policy.As a final thought: Tether’s resistance to MiCA seems to be more than just a protest against red tape. It’s making a bet that crypto’s future will be shaped outside Brussels, not inside it.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/why-tether-refuses-to-comply-with-mica?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-23T05:11:25.000Z,"Trendspotting in crypto: How to discover winning projects before the crowd","TL;DRSpotting the next big crypto project before it explodes demands data, discipline and a sharp eye for real signals. This guide explores how to identify early winners by analyzing onchain metrics, tokenomics, dev activity and community traction while avoiding the common traps of hype-driven pumps and red-flag projects.Despite the crypto space being crowded, fast-moving and full of noise, some investors manage to consistently find promising projects while they’re still under the radar.So, how do they do it? Crypto trendspotters know how to read onchain data. They understand tokenomics. They read GitHub commits and follow the money. It takes more than jumping on the hype bandwagon ahead of the crowd.This guide breaks down how to find crypto projects with real potential using lessons from past winners like Solana, Arbitrum, Chainlink and even memecoins like Pepe. Along the way, it will highlight the tools that matter, red flags to avoid and the difference between organic growth and manufactured buzz.How the real winners took offSolanaWhen Solana launched in 2020, few outside of developer circles had heard of it. But it had one big edge: speed. Solana’s proof-of-history tech made it one of the fastest chains around, and it quickly became a magnet for builders, especially in DeFi and NFTs. By 2021, its ecosystem exploded with apps like Serum and Magic Eden.Early adopters who paid attention to onchain growth — like wallet activity and DEX volume — could see something brewing. Solana (SOL) went from under $1 to $50+ in less than a year. Arbitrum Arbitrum launched in 2021 as an Ethereum layer 2, but its big moment came with the Arbitrum (ARB) token airdrop in March 2023. At launch, Arbitrum was already processing more transactions than many layer 1s and had billions in total value locked (TVL) in decentralized applications (DApps).Smart investors were watching. Even before the token, the signs were there: user activity, rising liquidity and growing app adoption. When ARB dropped, the pump stuck because the foundation was real.ChainlinkChainlink is a classic example of a project with long-term utility. It doesn’t have flashy branding or meme power, but it does one thing incredibly well: feed real-world data into smart contracts.By 2024, it had become the backbone of much of DeFi, gaming and even tokenized real-world assets. If you were watching closely in 2019-2020, you saw LINK (LINK) getting integrated everywhere. That kind of early utility often flies under the radar — until price action catches up.PEPE Coin (PEPE)Let’s not pretend memes don’t matter. Pepe (PEPE) launched in 2023 with no roadmap, no utility and no VC backing. But it hit a nerve, and the internet ran with it. The coin hit a billion-dollar market cap within weeks.That kind of run is rare — and risky. But for traders tracking social sentiment, wallet distribution and community activity, the early signals were all there. PEPE didn’t promise anything, but it delivered returns by becoming a viral moment.How to find crypto gems earlySo, how do you separate the next Solana from the next rug pull? Here’s how serious trendspotters approach it.1. Start with onchain metricsPublic blockchains are transparent. Use that to look at:Daily active walletsTransaction volumeTokenholder growthLiquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs)TVL (for DeFi projects).If users and capital are moving in — before the token moons — that’s a great sign. Tools like Dune Analytics, Nansen and DefiLlama are your best friends here.2. Understand the tokenomicsAsk questions like:What’s the total supply? How much is circulating?Are there upcoming unlocks or vesting cliffs?Who holds the tokens, and how concentrated are the top wallets?Is there utility? Does the token do anything?Tokens with capped supply, smart incentives (like staking or burn mechanisms) and fair distribution models tend to do better long-term.3. Check developer activityIs the team actually building?GitHub is a goldmine. Look at how often code is pushed, how many contributors are active, and whether the repo looks alive. No updates for months? Big red flag.You don’t need to read code — just track commits and releases. Projects with real traction are always shipping.4. Look for ecosystem signalsAre other developers building on top of it? Are DApps launching? Is liquidity growing? Are users coming back week after week?Ecosystem growth is hard to fake, and it’s often the strongest early indicator that a project has legs.5. Follow the communityX, Discord, Telegram, Reddit — yes, it’s noisy. But it’s also where trends start. Look beyond the price talk:Are people actually using the product?Are devs answering questions?Is the tone constructive or just hype?Use LunarCrush or Santiment to track social momentum, but always double-check it with onchain data.Key tools to spot crypto trendsHere’s a quick rundown of the top platforms used by smart crypto trendspotters:Top tip: Don’t just use one tool. Great traders cross-reference everything.Crypto trend analysis 2025A coin might be flying, but is it because people are actually using it or just talking about it? Learning to tell the difference can save you from making a bad investment. Signs of real tractionSteady user growth and TVL over time: If users are showing up before a token pumps — and the numbers keep climbing week over week — that’s usually a sign of substance. You’ll often see this in DeFi protocols or layer 2s gaining trust slowly, not overnight.Code commits and product updates: A live GitHub with regular commits, active devs and visible progress means the team is building. This shows momentum and long-term focus — not just a marketing push.More tokenholders, less whale control: When new holders join steadily — and supply isn’t all locked up by the top five wallets — it’s a healthier setup. Distributed ownership reduces the risk of rug pulls or coordinated dumps.New integrations and ecosystem activity: If other apps are integrating the token or building on the protocol, it usually means the tech is solid and useful. This kind of network effect compounds fast and often precedes a breakout.Liquidity that builds slowly: Gradual increases in liquidity and trading volume tend to reflect real interest. If liquidity sticks around (rather than vanishing after a pump), it’s usually organic.Signs of manufactured hypeSudden spikes in social mentions or trading volume with no news: If the project is everywhere on X overnight, but there’s no product update, launch or roadmap shift, be skeptical. It’s likely a coordinated shill.Influencer spam and recycled talking points: When you see multiple anonymous influencers posting the same meme or catchphrase, that’s a signal someone’s trying to manufacture buzz.No dev activity or roadmap: If there’s no GitHub, no changelog and the team isn’t shipping anything, it’s probably just a hype machine.Anonymous team, outrageous promises: Combine a mystery team with claims like “100x guaranteed,” and you’re likely looking at a cash grab. Real builders let the work speak for itself.Rule of thumb: If the price is moving and everything else — users, devs, integrations — is standing still, you’re looking at hype. But when those fundamentals are quietly ticking up in the background? That’s when it’s worth a closer look.More red flagsSome projects look great on the surface — slick websites, trending hashtags, a fast-moving chart — but fall apart under the hood. Here are some more red flags to watch out for:High holder concentration: If most of the token is sitting in a handful of wallets, it doesn’t take much for a price crash. Whales often buy early and dump on retail.Unverified token contracts: A token that hasn’t been verified on Etherscan or BscScan might hide functions that allow minting, blocking wallets or draining liquidity. Always check the contract or look for an audit.No liquidity lock or audit: If the devs control all the liquidity provider tokens and there’s no lock or time-locked contract, they can pull the rug at any moment. Similarly, no third-party audit? That’s a gamble.Big token unlocks coming up: Large unlocks for insiders or early investors can trigger huge sell-offs. If you’re holding during a major vesting event, you could be exit liquidity. Know the schedule.Top tip: Before you click buy, ask, Who stands to gain the most if this pumps? Who gets hurt if it dumps? If the answer points to a few insiders with heavy bags and zero accountability, walk away.How to spot crypto trends before the crowdThe best early investors are the mechanics looking under the hood. They study token structures and unlock schedules, join communities early to catch signals firsthand, and follow the builders to see who’s actually shipping. Most importantly, they cross-check everything: on-chain data, social sentiment, developer activity, and liquidity. Tools like Dune, DefiLlama, Nansen and GitHub help them separate noise from substance — and spot winners before the crowd does.Crypto rewards those who are curious, critical and a little bit contrarian. The crowd usually shows up late. If you want to find gems before they moon, you’ll need to think independently, dig deeper, and act before the narrative forms.It’s not easy. But it’s doable. And the more you practice spotting early signals — the real ones, not the noise — the more second nature it becomes.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

According to a report from My London, Jacob Irwin-Cline went out to a London bar and had several drinks before calling an Uber to take him home.Cline said that he did not thoroughly check the details of the Uber ride on his phone and left with a random private cab driver resembling the Uber driver at first glance, but driving a different vehicle — a detail Cline would only discover after the incident.Once inside the vehicle, the US tourist said the driver offered him a cigarette, which Cline said was likely laced with a rare and potent sedative drug called scopolamine. Cline added that the cigarette made him feel extremely docile and tired, causing him to pass out for around 30 minutes before regaining consciousness.Shortly after Cline woke up, the driver ordered him out of the vehicle. As Cline exited, the driver suddenly sped off, striking him with the car and fleeing with his cellphone, which contained his private keys and access to his crypto accounts.The unfortunate incident comes amid a recent spate of kidnappings, extortion incidents, armed robberies, and ransom attempts directed at crypto industry executives, investors, and their families.

The proposed amendment would come after 18 Democrats sided with Republicans in the Senate in voting to advance the bill on May 20 after it failed a procedural vote on May 8.“Passing the GENIUS Act without our anti-corruption amendment stamps a Congressional seal of approval on Trump selling access and influence to the highest bidder,” Merkley said in a May 22 X post.Trump his three sons are involved in the crypto platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI), which launched its USD1 stablecoin in March.

The $2.2 billion position in futures markets signals growing interest from traders, but it is not necessarily bullish, as those instruments can also be used to speculate on the XRP price downside.XRP futures open interest on major exchanges, XRP. Source: CoinGlassSome traders argue that the increased demand for leveraged XRP positions indicates growing institutional interest, especially as multiple issuers filed for a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) listing in the US. However, the final decision by the US SEC should be made in October.Excessive demand for bullish leveraged XRP causes a positive funding rate, meaning longs (buyers) are the ones paying the carry cost. As cryptocurrency traders are generally optimistic, a 7% to 14% annualized funding rate is expected in neutral markets, while periods of FOMO can push the indicator above 50%.XRP futures annualized funding rate. Source: Laevitas.chThe annualized funding rate jumped to 19% on May 22, nearing the highest levels in six months. Still, the current optimism level is nowhere near the 100% annualized funding rate from Dec. 4, 2024, which followed an impressive 7-day rally to $2.90 from $1.33. Far from being bearish, the current level leaves room for bullish positioning on XRP futures markets.Related: Which senators invest in crypto? 11 lawmakers have blockchain-related investmentsFavorable regulation opens the door for new partnerships and acquisitionsPart of the limited XRP price upside can be explained by the multiple rejections of US Senator Cynthia Lummis, Chair of the US Congress Digital Assets Subcommittee, to meet Ripple representatives. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse asked on May 19 that the lawmaker “reconsider and be a leader for ALL of crypto,” and discuss “how to make the US the crypto capital of the world.”There is nothing stopping XRP from hitting $3.50 or even higher, as Ripple Labs is no longer facing direct threats from regulators, which paves the way for partnerships and acquisitions. Historically, XRP has reacted very positively following those announcements, and the $2.2 billion futures open interest could help catapult XRP price above the current $3.25 all-time high.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

However, SOL needs a clear market structure break (MSB) or a decisive bullish breakout above $180 to trigger the next leg of the rally. Declining volumes during the consolidation phase suggest caution, as a lack of buying pressure could stall the breakout. If SOL fails to breach $180, the immediate key area of interest is between $140-150, and the bull flag pattern would be invalidated.

2025-05-22T15:00:00.000Z,"Semiconductor exemptions don’t matter when it comes to tariffs","Opinion by: Ahmad Shadid of O.xyzSemiconductors scored a rare exemption from US President Donald Trump’s aggressive reciprocal tariffs, but the relief is symbolic at best. Most semiconductors enter the US embedded in servers, GPUs, laptops, and smartphones. The finished goods remain heavily tariffed, some with duties reaching up to 49%. The exemption looks good politically but delivers little practical benefit. Nvidia’s DGX systems, crucial for training advanced AI models, do not fall under the exempted HTS codes. Nvidia could pay effective tariffs nearing 40% on these vital components. Such costs threaten to stall critical AI infrastructure projects across the country. Semiconductor tariffs may compromise the goal of the CHIPS Act. The act promised tens of billions of dollars in subsidies to support domestic chip manufacturing. Yet advanced lithography machines — key equipment from countries like the Netherlands and Japan — face 20%–24% tariffs. Ironically, tariffs designed to boost American production increase the cost of essential manufacturing equipment.The effect of new tariffs is already slowing progress in critical supply chains — just as generative AI and large language models are gaining momentum across sectors like finance and defense. Any delays or cost increases now could blunt America’s technological advantage.Indirect costs undermine exemptions for AIModern semiconductor supply chains are global and highly integrated. An exemption on raw silicon means nothing when servers, GPUs and other finished products face steep tariffs. Tariffs indirectly inflate costs, eliminating any competitive advantage from domestic manufacturing.Indirect tariff costs hit high-end systems disproportionately hard. The effect ripples through AI model training, data center expansions and major infrastructure projects, significantly slowing the industry’s momentum.Tariff impasse halts investmentSo far, it’s clear that the US president’s tariff plan didn’t follow any conventional economic trends or calculated strategy. The uncertain tariff situation stalls investment decisions across the technology sector. Companies need predictable costs to justify large capital expenditures. Ongoing tariff volatility prevents them from committing resources to new data centers and manufacturing lines.This mirrors the supply chain chaos of 2020. At that time, uncertainty caused massive order cancellations and slowed industry recovery for years. If tariff ambiguity continues, we could see similar waves of cancellations in 2025. This would further compound existing inventory and revenue issues in the semiconductor sector.Domestic production is not optimalThe border argument for these tariffs is that they’re meant to boost domestic production. They do little, however, to encourage genuine domestic semiconductor production. Despite subsidies under the CHIPS Act, most US semiconductor companies still rely on international foundries for manufacturing. Instead, they face increased equipment and operational costs.Recent: How trade wars impact stocks and cryptoThe idea that tariffs promote domestic production ignores the reality of global semiconductor manufacturing. Costs rise across the board, putting American companies at a disadvantage rather than offering protection.AI projects face heightened riskThe blockchain and crypto sectors, particularly AI-driven projects, also feel the pinch. Projects depend heavily on GPUs and high-performance servers for mining, validating transactions and running decentralized AI computations. Increased hardware costs directly affect profitability and growth, potentially stalling innovation in blockchain applications. AI developments have just started to pick up the pace in the blockchain and Web3 space. The industry saw increased interest from investors and VCs just a year ago. So, they are still on tighter budgets. Elevated costs can, however, lead to stagnation. We might see innovators and developers exiting the market. The ripple effect extends beyond the general technology sector and could threaten future digital economies. Moreover, these cost pressures disproportionately affect startups and smaller tech firms. Industry giants can absorb additional expenses, but innovative, smaller players face existential threats. This dynamic risks stifling innovation at the grassroots level, harming the entire tech ecosystem.What to expect Semiconductors have momentarily escaped direct tariffs, but the exemption provides little benefit. Tariffs continue to hit finished products, driving up indirect costs across the industry. Instead of boosting domestic manufacturing, these tariffs create economic paralysis, stall critical infrastructure projects, and threaten America’s lead in AI innovation. Policymakers must acknowledge these realities and adjust their approach before irreversible damage is done to the nation’s technological future.Opinion by: Ahmad Shadid of O.xyz.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-22T13:39:15.000Z,"Exponential currency debasement: ‘You don’t own enough crypto, NFTs’","Cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can help investors protect their eroding purchasing power during an era of exponential currency debasement, according to analysts and industry leaders.Investing in digital assets is becoming increasingly important in the “world of the exponential age and currency debasement,” according to Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Global Macro Investor.“You don’t own enough crypto. When you do, you don’t own enough NFT’s, as art is upstream of wealth. Both will never be this cheap again,” Pal said.NFTs are “the single best long term store of wealth I know and you get to buy it before network effects kick in,” he added in another response.Source: Raoul Pal“There is some validity to the statement that NFTs, and in extension art, become a vehicle for the wealthy once a certain level of wealth is reached,” wrote Nicolai Sondergaard, research analyst at Nansen, calling it a “natural move” for asset diversification.“For traders and investors, further down the wealth curve, NFTs are partially about speculating on future returns,” he told Cointelegraph, adding that NFTs also benefit from the allure of strong communities, beyond just wealth creation.Related: German gov’t missed out on $2.3B profit after selling Bitcoin at $57KArt NFTs may see a resurgence as “digital ownership gains acceptance among younger, tech-savvy cohorts,” if collections manage to move past the “speculative fervor,” according to Anndy Lian, author and intergovernmental blockchain expert.Still, Lian said broader adoption depends on blockchain networks improving scalability and security to “instill confidence.” He added that art NFTs “must transcend hype, anchoring value in cultural significance or utility.”  Beeple’s “Everydays: The First 5000 Days.” Source: ChristiesSome digital artists made millions of dollars through NFTs.

2025-05-22T13:30:00.000Z,"How staking incentivizes trust without burning energy","What if a financial system could run itself not by burning electricity, but by rewarding good behavior? That’s the promise of staking, a mechanism that powers many modern blockchains by turning users into network operators. In this week’s episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Gareth Jenkinson and Nathan Jeffay sit down with StarkWare’s Noam Nisan to unpack how this trustless engine works, why it matters and what’s really at stake.Understanding stakingJeffay began by highlighting how staking is part of the backbone that keeps the blockchain running, and runs itself, with volunteers.“By doing this, they’re saying, OK, we’re taking this task of running the blockchain seriously. Here's some of our money. We're putting it down. We're showing that we're serious about doing this.”To help unpack this topic further and examine the deeper mechanics behind staking, the hosts are joined by Noam Nisan, principal researcher at StarkWare and a widely respected computer scientist who has held roles at Google and Princeton.Related: How to handle crypto trading gains and losses on your balance sheet“So we have this general system with operators... Why would they want to do that? The system, the protocol, incentivizes them to actually run the system,” Nisan explained. “Basically, it can give them tokens for operating the system.”Staking offers what Nisan describes as two distinct types of security: computer science-based guarantees and economic disincentives for bad actors. “If a majority or supermajority, maybe two-thirds of the parties of the token of the staked amount are behaving properly... we can prove that the system acts correctly,” he said. “But you also have what I would call an economic guarantee... if they destroy the system, very likely the value of the token... will go down. So they are the one losing.”PoW vs PoSJenkinson, a vocal Bitcoin (BTC) supporter, posed the classic comparison: proof-of-work vs proof-of-stake. “Do you have any strong feelings about one or the other?” he asked.“The truth is that it’s not clear.. it's really a social question, I think.”Nisan noted that both mechanisms involve trade-offs around cost, control, and decentralization. The episode also explores the role of staking in tokenomics and system design. Nisan unpacks how fee mechanics and inflation controls, such as Ethereum’s minting curve, help keep the ecosystem in balance.To hear the full conversation on The Clear Crypto Podcast,  listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

Fueled by BTC’s rally, several high-risk tokens are posting even larger gains, stoking possibilities that they could continue to outperform Bitcoin as the crypto bull run accelerates.Fartcoin ascending channel hints at more gainsSolana-based Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) memecoin has surged 30% in the last three days to hit $1.57 as of May 22, its highest level in the last four months.The rally extends Fartcoin’s strong year-to-date (YTD) performance—up 74.50%—amid the ongoing memecoin frenzy. In comparison, Bitcoin has risen 18% so far in 2025.Technically, Fartcoin is trading within a well-defined ascending channel that began forming in early March, suggesting sustained bullish momentum.FARTCOIN/USDT daily price chart.

If the uptrend holds, Fartcoin could retest the channel’s upper boundary near $2.74 by June, up 80% from the current price levels.Dogwifhat price could doubleLike FARTCOIN, Dogwifhat (WIF) has outperformed Bitcoin during the recent rally, up over 27% in the past three days. But the Solana memecoin has underperformed the top cryptocurrency year-to-date, down about 38%.But a bull pennant formation may put Dogwifhat in a position to catch up in the coming weeks.

It is, therefore, underperforming Bitcoin on a YTD timeframe but, like WIF, shows the potential of outperforming BTC this cycle in percentage terms.At the core of this bullish outlook is SPX6900’s ongoing bullish reversal attempts.

2025-05-22T12:38:44.000Z,"UK court partially dismisses Bitcoin SV investor’s lawsuit against Binance","The United Kingdom’s Court of Appeal has partially dismissed a lawsuit brought by Bitcoin SV investors against major crypto exchanges, including Binance, for allegedly conspiring to delist the token in 2019.In a judgment handed down on May 21, the court ruled that investors who held BSV through the delisting period (classified as “sub-class B”) were not entitled to billions in speculative damages based on BSV’s hypothetical growth.These investors had claimed over 8.9 billion British pounds ($11.9 billion) in damages, asserting that Binance’s delisting deprived holders of the chance to profit from BSV’s potential rise to a “top-tier cryptocurrency” like Bitcoin (BTC) or Bitcoin Cash (BCH).The court rejected this “foregone growth effect” theory, stating, “BSV was obviously not a unique cryptocurrency without reasonably similar substitutes,” pointing to the representative’s own use of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash as comparators.Sub-class B’s central claim was that delisting led to a missed opportunity to benefit from price appreciation. However, the court determined that those investors had ample chance to mitigate losses by selling or reinvesting in other crypto assets.“They had a duty to mitigate their losses,” wrote Master of the Rolls Sir Geoffrey Vos. “They cannot recover losses that they could reasonably have mitigated.”UK court ruling against Bitcoin SV investor’s lawsuit. Source: CaselawRelated: Bitcoin SV investors attempt to resurrect 2019 Binance lawsuitCourt strikes down “loss of a chance” argumentThe appeal also challenged the Tribunal’s application of the “market mitigation rule,” arguing that such issues should be left for trial.The court dismissed that notion, stating the rule clearly applies to freely tradable assets like BSV, and that the damages must be measured shortly after the delisting.An additional argument concerning the “loss of a chance” to benefit from future price gains was also struck down. The court ruled it “flawed as a matter of principle,” noting that “cryptocurrencies are, by their nature, volatile investments.”Binance’s limited strike-out application ultimately succeeded, with the court stating that even if some holders were unaware of the delisting, “they could never claim more than the total value of their holding before the delisting events plus any quantifiable consequential losses.”Related: Binance wants arbitration for all members of securities class suitBinance seeks to dismiss FTX lawsuitOn May 16, Binance filed a motion to dismiss a $1.76 billion lawsuit filed by the FTX estate, arguing that the claims are legally flawed and an attempt to shift responsibility for FTX’s collapse.The exchange stated the downfall of FTX stemmed from internal fraud, not external manipulation, citing Sam Bankman-Fried’s conviction on multiple fraud charges.Binance has asked the court to dismiss all claims with prejudice.

2025-05-22T10:43:14.000Z,"Bitcoin tops Amazon market cap on ‘Pizza Day’ as price sets new highs","The market cap of the world’s first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has surpassed that of retail and tech behemoth Amazon on “Bitcoin Pizza Day.”Market data shows that Bitcoin (BTC) had a market cap of $2.205 trillion at the time of writing, $70 billion more than the $2.135 trillion Amazon valuation.“By surpassing Amazon in terms of capitalization, Bitcoin has attracted even more attention from the non-crypto audience,” said Alex Obchakevich, founder of Obchakevich Research. Obchakevich believes the latest rally “will strengthen confidence in Bitcoin and lead to new injections into the crypto market.” The surge came as Bitcoin set a new all-time high and now trades above $110,000, which Obchavich said will “attract new investors to large funds.” Obchakevich noted that institutional players continue to play a growing role in the digital asset space:“In May, BlackRock became the second largest bitcoin holder after Satoshi Nakamoto, surpassing Binance in this indicator.”Hassan Khan, the CEO of Bitcoin liquidity platform Ordeez, told Cointelegraph that “this is a structural change.” He explained that “Bitcoin is no longer simply a hedge, it’s in the process of becoming a benchmark currency.”Related: Bitcoin 'looks exhausted' as next bear market yields $69K targetThe crypto market approaches new highsAccording to CoinMarketCap data, the total cryptocurrency market cap stood at $3.49 trillion at the time of writing.

2025-05-22T10:21:18.000Z,"Can ChatGPT-powered AI agents really trade crypto for you?","Key takeawaysChatGPT-powered AI agents automate trading tasks using natural language prompts and API integrations, improving speed and consistency.Successes occur when ChatGPT is used as a support tool, not a fully autonomous trading system.Failures happen when traders over-rely on ChatGPT without real-time data, proper risk management or manual oversight.Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance.What if a crypto trader didn’t need to constantly check charts, worry about emotions, or stay up all night watching for sudden price swings? What if those tasks could be handled by an intelligent agent that understands instructions in plain English — and reacts within milliseconds? That’s where ChatGPT-powered AI agents come in.These tools combine natural language processing with real-time trading logic to automate decision-making in one of the world’s most volatile markets. From rebalancing portfolios to reacting to market sentiment, ChatGPT is being adapted to act as a trading assistant, risk manager and market analyst — all rolled into one. But can it truly match or even outperform human intuition? This article explores how far these agents have come, where they shine and where they still fall short.How ChatGPT-powered AI agents operate in cryptocurrency marketsChatGPT-powered AI agents are changing how people interact with crypto markets. These tools combine ChatGPT’s language abilities with external trading tools and APIs to help users monitor prices, understand trends and even place trades automatically. Instead of just reacting to charts or numbers, ChatGPT can understand plain language commands like “Buy Ethereum if the price drops below $2,000” or “Sell Bitcoin if RSI goes above 70.”These AI trading assistants can work with major platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, OKX and other centralized or decentralized exchanges and can also tap into decentralized finance (DeFi) tools and smart contracts. With the right setup, ChatGPT can help automate trading strategies based on both technical data and market news.Success stories vs. failures in ChatGPT-powered crypto tradingSome traders have used ChatGPT to assist in automating parts of their crypto trading processes, particularly for strategy generation and sentiment analysis. For example, a user shared on Reddit that they used a ChatGPT-based AI agent for technical analysis on Ether (ETH), feeding it four-hour and daily chart screenshots. By interpreting market sentiment, support and resistance zones, and other indicators, they managed to make $6,500 in profits.Similarly, in the broader crypto sector, ChatGPT has been applied to support project development activities such as drafting white papers and marketing content. A notable example is the launch of the “TURBO” memecoin, which reportedly reached a market capitalization of over $50 million in 2024. In this case, ChatGPT was used to streamline documentation and communication rather than manage trading activity, illustrating its usefulness as a support tool in crypto-related initiatives.However, limitations are evident when ChatGPT is applied beyond its core design. While ChatGPT could suggest a trading portfolio and explain its reasoning clearly, it lacks access to real-time market data and couldn’t respond to sudden volatility. In one instance, ChatGPT was allocated $100 across multiple tokens but failed to actively manage the portfolio as prices fluctuated. This resulted in missed opportunities and underperformance compared to dynamic algorithmic strategies.Individual experiences reinforce these observations. A Redditor exposed a scam where a YouTuber promoted a “ChatGPT trading bot” tutorial that led users to deploy malicious smart contracts. The contracts, generated using ChatGPT and passed off as safe, were designed to drain user wallets once funded. Victims collectively lost $17,240 in ETH, highlighting the danger of blindly trusting AI-generated code without proper auditing.Even when asked, “If I use ChatGPT to build an AI agent for crypto trading, can I become a millionaire?” ChatGPT responded with a realistic outlook — acknowledging that while it’s possible, success depends on having a profitable strategy, disciplined risk management, and the ability to scale effectively.Here is ChatGPT’s response:These cases suggest that while ChatGPT can support certain elements of the trading process, it should not be treated as a standalone solution for autonomous crypto trading.AI in crypto trading: Key benefits and limitationsAI tools like ChatGPT are increasingly being integrated into crypto trading workflows to improve speed, accuracy and efficiency. While they offer important advantages, they also carry specific limitations that traders must actively manage. Below are the main benefits and challenges:Key benefits of using AI for crypto tradingAI bots can execute trades in milliseconds, crucial for capturing opportunities in fast-moving crypto markets.Bots follow pre-programmed rules precisely, eliminating emotional biases that often affect human traders.Crypto markets are always open, and AI bots can monitor and act around the clock without interruption.A single bot can manage multiple trading pairs, exchanges and strategies simultaneously.ChatGPT can understand specific prompts like “Rebalance every Monday” or “Set stop-loss at 5%,” allowing flexible automation.Limitations of ChatGPT in cryptocurrency tradingChatGPT does not access live market data unless specifically integrated with external APIs (e.g., TradingView, CoinMarketCap or exchange websockets).Instructions must be clear and unambiguous; ChatGPT may misinterpret vague or complex commands.Improperly secured API keys or lack of two-factor authentication (2FA) can expose trading accounts to unauthorized access.ChatGPT’s cloud-based infrastructure can introduce latency, which could impact performance during highly volatile periods.ChatGPT does not monitor regional compliance rules; users must manually enforce trading limits based on local regulations.Ethical and regulatory implications of AI in crypto tradingAs AI becomes more integrated into trading systems, it raises significant ethical and regulatory concerns that stakeholders across the financial sector are beginning to address.Accountability: If an AI agent executes a harmful or unlawful trade, questions arise around legal responsibility. It remains unclear in many jurisdictions whether liability falls primarily on the developer, the trader using the AI system or the platform facilitating the transactions.Market manipulation risks: Autonomous AI bots could unintentionally engage in activities such as spoofing (placing and canceling fake orders to mislead the market) or wash trading (creating artificial volume), especially if not properly programmed with compliance safeguards.Regulatory oversight: Financial authorities, including the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the European Securities and Markets Authority, are actively studying the implications of AI and algorithmic trading. These agencies have recognized that traditional trading regulations may not fully account for autonomous decision-making by AI systems.Policy developments: In January 2024, the European Commission released updates to its Digital Finance Strategy, which included references to AI-based financial services. While not yet finalized, these draft regulations under the broader Digital Finance Package signal a move toward stricter compliance expectations for firms deploying AI in financial markets.Meanwhile, ethical crypto platforms are beginning to voluntarily disclose the use of trading bots in their systems. In parallel, open-source communities are advocating for clearer audit trails, improved model transparency and the establishment of ethical guidelines for AI applications in finance to ensure accountability and fairness.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Crypto travelers are also outspending their fiat counterparts, with an average booking value of  $1,211 per transaction, over 2.5 times more than fiat users who spend $469.Additionally, the report said crypto users were three times more valuable over their lifetime due to longer stays and higher repeat bookings, with crypto travelers 57% more likely to make a repeat hotel purchase.Source: Binance Pay, TravalaJuan Otero, CEO of Travala, attributed these travel preferences to the flexible nature of Web3 jobs:“Many also work in the digital asset industry or have flexible, remote work lifestyles, which makes them more likely to travel frequently and stay in one place for longer while seeking out destinations that support seamless, global payments.”Crypto-based transactions have become more common in the travel sector and beyond. Airlines that have integrated digital currencies into their booking systems have seen a 40% boost in bookings, with travel and hospitality representing 14% of all crypto transactions in 2024, according to a Feb. 21 report by Triple-A.Related: Crypto spending will grow, but fiat isn’t going anywhere: Mercuryo CEOThe main benefit of using crypto for travel is its borderless, global utility, Jonathan Lim, the global head of Binance Pay, told Cointelegraph. “Travelers can skip currency exchange lines, avoid foreign transaction fees, and pay instantly using assets they already hold,” he added.A growing number of crypto users also drives the increase in travelers using crypto to pay for trips. Triple-A’s report shows that cryptocurrency ownership has a compound annual growth rate of 99%, significantly outpacing the growth of traditional payment methods. Among crypto owners, 65% express interest in using it for payments.Founded in 2017, Travala is among the most popular crypto-native travel platforms, which enables users to pay for services like flights, hotel stays and tours with 141 different cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC) and USDC (USDC) via Binance Pay. Related: Bhutan launches tourism crypto payments with Binance Pay and DK BankCrypto payment covers more and more retail industriesThe first real-world Bitcoin transaction — 10,000 BTC for two pizzas — occurred 15 years ago today, on May 22, 2010, now commemorated as Bitcoin Pizza Day.

2025-05-22T08:37:57.000Z,"Dubai regulator clarifies real-world asset tokenization rules: Lawyer","Newly updated guidelines from Dubai’s crypto regulator include provisions on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and clarify rules for issuers. On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) released its updated Rulebook for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) operating in the region. The regulator gave market participants until June 19 to comply with the new rules. The regulator previously told Cointelegraph that it had enhanced supervisory mechanisms and brought consistency across activity-based rules. One of the more prominent changes includes regulatory clarity on RWA tokens. Irina Heaver, partner at the United Arab Emirates-based law firm NeosLegal, told Cointelegraph that the updated rules clarify RWA issuance and distribution. “Issuing real-world asset tokens and listing them on secondary markets is no longer theoretical,” Heaver told Cointelegraph. “It’s now a regulatory reality in Dubai and the broader UAE.”A “viable” path to realize RWA hypeHeaver compared RWAs to security token offerings (STOs), an earlier attempt from the crypto space to tokenize securities like stocks, bonds and real estate investment trusts. However, the UAE crypto lawyer said that STOs “died a peaceful death in 2018 to 2019.” The lawyer told Cointelegraph STOs did not work out because of the lack of regulatory clarity, viable secondary market trading venues, institutional investor appetite and liquidity. Still, the situation is different for RWAs. Heaver told Cointelegraph that RWAs are the next foundational layer for institutional adoption of blockchain and virtual assets. Heaver said that VARA’s new rules already cover them as Asset-Referenced Virtual Assets (ARVA) tokens. She said: “VARA’s newly updated Virtual Asset Issuance Rulebook (May 2025) addresses these failures head-on. Regulated exchanges and broker-dealers in Dubai are now authorized to distribute and list ARVA tokens.”The lawyer said this solves an issue in jurisdictions like Switzerland, where token issuance is possible, but listing and secondary trading remain unregulated. Related: Dubai gov’t agencies to link real estate registry with property tokenizationLawyer shares requirements for RWA issuersHeaver said ARVA tokens are defined under Dubai law as representing direct or indirect ownership of real-world assets, granting entitlement to receive or share income and purporting to maintain a stable value by reference to real-world assets or income. ARVA tokens are also backed or collateralised by such real-world assets or constitute a derivative, wrapped, duplicated, or fractionalised version of another ARVA. The lawyer said issuers must meet specific requirements, including a Category 1 Virtual Asset Issuance license, a comprehensive white paper and a risk disclosure statement. In addition, issuers must have a paid-up capital of 1.5 million UAE dirhams (about $408,000) or 2% of reserve assets held. The issuers are also subjected to monthly independent audit obligations and must adhere to ongoing supervisory oversight. “VARA is providing regulatory clarity, and it’s giving the industry a viable, enforceable path to turn the hype of RWA tokenization into reality,” Heaver told Cointelegraph. “This matters because it marks a shift, from theory to execution, from fiction to framework.”Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/dubai-vara-guidelines-rwa-tokenization-clarity?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-22T08:25:00.000Z,"5 red flags you’re being shilled: Don’t buy the hype","What is shilling in crypto?              At its core, shilling is the act of artificially promoting a cryptocurrency or token, often with exaggerated claims, to increase its price or popularity. But what’s the goal? Hype it up, get others to buy in, and then cash out, leaving latecomers holding the bag.Shilling can come from anyone: influencers, anonymous accounts or even high-profile figures with political or financial clout. The common thread is manipulation: It’s not about educating you or building real value but pumping hype for personal gain.Unfortunately, the line between enthusiastic promotion and outright deception can be thin, and many fall victim without realizing it. That’s why it’s critical to learn how to spot the signs early.                  5 red flags you’re being shilled              Beware of crypto red flags like overhyped promises, anonymous teams, influencer shills, missing products and FOMO tactics — if it smells like a scam, it probably is.1. Overhyped promises You’ve probably seen posts that scream:“100x potential!”“Guaranteed returns!”“This is your ticket to financial freedom!”These are classic shill tactics. Real, credible projects don’t promise life-changing profits. Why? Because there are no guarantees in crypto or in any investment.When a project leads with grandiose financial claims rather than actual product value or utility, it’s likely a ploy to stir FOMO and attract unsuspecting investors. The truth is, if something sounds too good to be true, it almost always is.Remember: The bigger the promise, the bigger the red flag.2. Anonymous or suspicious teams In crypto, anonymity isn’t always bad, but when you’re trusting people with your money, transparency matters.It’s a major red flag when a project has:No identifiable team membersFake names or aliasesStock photos on its websiteNo LinkedIn or professional history.The simple rule is “No face, no funds.”Scammers often hide behind anonymity because they know they’ll eventually vanish and there’ll be no one to hold accountable. Even worse, some use fabricated credentials or hire actors to pose as team members.Before investing, check whether the founders or developers have any verifiable history. Do they have prior experience in blockchain or startups? Have they launched anything successful before?3. Influencer spam and paid promotions One day, no one’s talking about a particular coin — the next, your feed is flooded with influencers hyping it up. Sound familiar?This sudden burst of attention is often coordinated with a paid promotion campaign disguised as “genuine enthusiasm.”Many influencers fail to disclose sponsorships, even though it’s required by law in many countries. The US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have cracked down on this in recent years.Take, for example:Kim Kardashian, who was fined $1.26 million in 2022 for promoting EthereumMax without proper disclosure.Floyd Mayweather Jr., who was sued for endorsing the same project at a paid event.BitBoy (Ben Armstrong), who faced legal action in multiple lawsuits for promoting scam tokens to his audience.If you notice multiple influencers promoting the same project in a short time, especially without using labels like #ad or #sponsored, it’s a strong indicator of a shill campaign.Don’t mistake volume for value. Hype doesn’t equal legitimacy.4. No real product or roadmapIf you visit the project’s website, it looks sleek, maybe even impressive. But where’s the product? Where’s the code?Shilled tokens often rely on flashy marketing but have no working application, no GitHub code and no actual use case. Everything is either “coming soon” or buried behind vague promises.Ask yourself:Can I use the platform or app today?Is there a white paper that makes sense?Do they have public repositories or open development?If all you’re seeing is a landing page and a vague roadmap that’s been “coming soon” for months, that’s a major red flag.5. Pressure tactics and FOMO Time pressure is a psychological weapon, and shillers know how to use it.Watch out for lines such as:“Presale ends in 2 hours!”“Only 1,000 spots left!”“If you don’t buy now, you’ll miss out forever!”These tactics prey on your fear of missing out (FOMO) and push you into making impulsive decisions without research.But crypto isn’t a sprint; it’s a long-term game. Anyone trying to rush you into buying likely has something to hide. Solid investments don’t need fake urgency.Take a breath, step back, and ask yourself: Am I buying because I believe in this project or because I’m being manipulated?Did you know? The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) secured a $128-million judgment against Ryan Mitchell Pope, Daniel Samuel Bishop and their company EmpiresX for operating a fraudulent forex and cryptocurrency investment scheme that defrauded over 12,500 victims.                  Is shilling illegal in crypto? Can influencers be sued?              Shilling isn’t just unethical in many cases — it’s also illegal.In the world of crypto, undisclosed promotions are a major legal risk. If someone is paid to promote a token or project but fails to reveal that financial connection, they could face fines, lawsuits or even criminal charges. This is especially true if the promoted token is later classified as a security under US law.Regulators like the SEC, FTC and CFTC have all cracked down on this behavior. Their targets have included:Influencers who failed to disclose paid promotionsPromoters who misled investors with false claimsIndividuals who ran pump-and-dump schemes using social media.Francier Obando Pinillo, a pastor from Miami, was indicted on 26 fraud counts for running a crypto scam through “Solano Fi,” defrauding investors of millions from 2021 to 2023. He allegedly used his church, social media and false promises of 34.9% monthly returns to lure victims. The platform showed fake gains but blocked withdrawals, while funds were diverted for personal use. Pinillo was arraigned in Richland, Washington and faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.As crypto becomes more mainstream, expect stricter regulations and more consequences for shillers.Did you know? Argentine President Javier Milei has dissolved the special task force investigating the LIBRA cryptocurrency scandal, a project he promoted in February 2025 that surged to a $4.5-billion valuation before crashing by over 97%. The task force, created by Milei himself, was disbanded via Decree 332/2025, citing that it had fulfilled its purpose. However, critics argue that no official findings were released, and judicial investigations into Milei and his associates continue.                  How to protect yourself from shilling scams              Do your own research, verify the team and utility, ignore hype and influencers, and stay alert to pump-and-dump schemes to avoid crypto shilling traps.Let’s understand how you can protect yourself from shilling scams in crypto:Do your own research (DYOR): Always research the project, the team behind it and the data supporting the claims. Don’t rely solely on hype or influencer recommendations. Look into onchain data, GitHub activity and the project’s utility to make informed decisions.Verify the team: A legitimate crypto project should have a transparent and credible team. If the developers are anonymous or have no professional profiles (like LinkedIn), that’s a red flag. Always check the team’s past projects and credibility before investing.Look for real utility: Does this project actually solve a problem? A genuine project should have a working product or solution, not just promises. Avoid projects that lack real-world utility or are still in “coming soon” stages for extended periods.Ignore the hype: If a token is suddenly trending on social media or being aggressively promoted, don’t let FOMO influence your judgment. Shillers often rely on emotions to push their agenda, so it’s essential to evaluate projects based on their merits, not just popularity.Stay skeptical of influencers: Influencers with large followings may be paid to promote certain tokens. Before taking their advice, ask yourself, What’s their incentive? Verify the promotion is legitimate and disclosed as paid or sponsored. Always cross-check the information with independent sources.Watch for pump-and-dump schemes: Be cautious of sudden price spikes followed by rapid drops. These are often signs of pump-and-dump schemes where the token’s value is artificially inflated by coordinated buying and then quickly sold off, leaving investors with losses. Always monitor price trends and be wary of sudden, unexplained increases in value.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/5-red-flags-youre-being-shilled-dont-buy-the-hype?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
