2025-05-23T16:58:18.000Z,"Bitcoin Breaks $111,600, Ethereum Rebounds, XRP Eyes Breakout, and FPPE Positions For 2,500% Early ROI","As Bitcoin (BTC) pushes past $111,600 and Ethereum (ETH) is gaining steam, XRP is nearing a breakout level — but its FloppyPepe (FPPE) , a new AI meme coin that is emerging as one of the most promising early-stage entries of the cycle. While the large caps signal strength, it’s the smaller tokens, particularly FloppyPepe (FPPE), that could present the highest returns. For those looking to build a position while prices remain accessible, this may be one of the few moments left before momentum picks up across the board. Bitcoin (BTC) Crosses $111,600 as Confidence Returns Bitcoin (BTC) has once again broken into uncharted territory, briefly surpassing $111,600 after a month of steady accumulation and improved market sentiment. Analysts point to renewed institutional inflows and easing regulatory rhetoric in the U.S. as primary catalysts. According to data from several on-chain trackers, Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETF) inflows have hit their highest levels since January, with over $3.6 billion in new capital entering Bitcoin (BTC) markets in the last 30 days. Due to falling exchange reserves and a tightening supply structure, Bitcoin (BTC) looks primed for another explosive leg up. Ethereum (ETH) Reclaims Momentum After Consolidation While Bitcoin (BTC) has stolen headlines, Ethereum (ETH) is quietly rebuilding strength. After holding support at the $2,400 level for much of May, Ethereum (ETH) is now trading above $2,600, with analysts calling for a continued push if current volume holds. Network activity on Ethereum (ETH) has improved, partly driven by stablecoin movement, Layer-2 interactions, and institutional interest . Staking continues to increase, and gas fees remain relatively low compared to past cycles, giving developers and end-users more reason to return. There’s growing optimism that if Ethereum (ETH) can clear the $2,800 resistance, it may begin to mirror Bitcoin’s (BTC) lead in the months ahead. XRP Holds $2.30; Experts Watch for Breakout Triggers XRP has managed to stay on course despite ongoing market turbulence, trading just above $2.40. Recent developments in the regulatory landscape have given XRP a much-needed boost. The long-standing dispute with the SEC is now fully resolved , and new leadership at the agency appears more crypto-literate, a development that bodes well for the token’s long-term plans. Market analysts are watching for a clean breakout past $2.85 for XRP, which could open the path toward retesting multi-year highs. XRP’s utility in cross-border payment networks makes it very valuable, and its chart structure invites traders and investors. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The AI Meme Coin Making a Serious Move While Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and XRP dominate the upper end of the market, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is making waves in a very different lane and gaining attention from early-stage investors. As an AI meme coin, FloppyPepe (FPPE) doesn’t just play into internet culture but also provides tools that help shape it. The project offers two working products: FloppyAI , a real-time meme generator that allows users to produce high-quality content from prompts FloppyX is a short-form video creation tool tailored for TikTok, Instagram, and X. These tools empower FloppyPepe (FPPE) holders to actively shape the coin’s visibility. So far, they have worked perfectly. The project has already raised $2 million in presale funding, with community-driven content spreading daily across major platforms. The opportunity is still live. The FloppyPepe (FPPE) presale is active at $0.00000035 , and buyers are currently eligible for an 80% bonus using the code FLOPPY80 . With 2,500% early ROI projections, analysts are positioning this new AI meme coin alongside other past-cycle breakouts like DOGE and SHIB. Final Look: Market Momentum Is Real, But Timing Still Matters As the crypto market turns a corner, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are signaling broader confidence, and XRP is preparing for a major push. However, for investors focused on return potential rather than market dominance, the smartest move may be to look further down the list. FloppyPepe (FPPE) checks several critical boxes – active community, low entry price, audited code, and actual product delivery. The 80% presale bonus won’t stay open for long, and as visibility increases, so will the barrier to entry. For now, FloppyPepe (FPPE) offers that rare mix of affordability, momentum, and upside, but it won’t be at this level for long.

2025-05-23T16:55:09.000Z,"First US-Based XRP Futures ETF Goes Live On Nasdaq Despite Ripple vs SEC Settlement Snag","The first-ever exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracking XRP futures started trading in the U.S. on May 22. The Volatility Shares XRP ETF trades on the Nasdaq under the ticker XRPI and offers one-to-one exposure to XRP’s daily performance. According to a prospectus, the new fund will invest at least 80% of its assets in XRP futures contracts and shares of other XRP-linked ETPs via a wholly-owned Cayman Islands subsidiary. Volatility Shares also plans to launch a leveraged 2x XRP futures ETF, which is designed to deliver twice the daily performance of XRP through leveraged exposure to XRP futures. With the new offerings, Volatility Shares will join Vermont-based asset manager Teucrium Investment Advisors in offering leveraged exposure to the price of XRP without holding the asset directly. Earlier last month, Teucrium debuted the Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF (XXRP), aiming to offer returns double those of XRP’s daily movements. Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas pointed out that the XXRP has managed to attract over $120 million in assets under management and averages $35 million in daily trading volume. Balchunas described it as a “good signal that there will be demand” for Volatility Shares’ XRPI. The news comes shortly after the CME Group rolled out XRP futures on its derivatives exchange, the largest in the U.S., which also lists BTC, ETH, and SOL products. Spot ETF And Legal Progress In Focus A bevy of issuers have filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for spot XRP ETFs. Notably, the regulator has already delayed making decisions on proposals from several would-be issuers. Meanwhile, Judge Analisa Torres of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York recently rejected a joint Ripple-SEC motion seeking an indicative ruling on their proposed settlement. As ZyCrypto reported , Torres denied the motion as “procedurally improper” since the SEC and Ripple failed to file the correct procedural motion to support the proposed settlement deal. The SEC and Ripple agreed to reduce Ripple’s $125 million fine to $50 million just days before CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced the case was over. “The parties have made no effort to satisfy that burden here; their request does not even mention the Rule,” Judge Torres said at the time. While the rejection does not reverse Ripple’s victory in the long-standing case, it certainly adds further uncertainty regarding when the SEC could greenlight spot XRP products as the legal saga remains ongoing.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/first-us-based-xrp-futures-etf-goes-live-on-nasdaq-despite-ripple-vs-sec-settlement-snag/,"BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP","Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News",cryptocompare

In a statement , Cetus Protocol confirms that a bad actor siphoned approximately $223 million worth of assets from the platform. The DEX says it has already taken measures to prevent further theft and secure the majority of the impacted funds. “$162M of the compromised funds have been successfully paused. We are working with the Sui Foundation and other ecosystem members right now on next-step solutions, with the goal of recovering the remaining stolen funds.” According to Sui, a large number of validators are already ignoring transactions on addresses with the looted assets. Meanwhile, the blockchain security firm SlowMist says some of the tokens were already swapped into USDC and bridged to Ethereum ( ETH ). Cetus says it is now negotiating for the return of the funds after identifying the Ethereum wallet controlled by the hacker. The protocol says the perpetrator can keep 2,324 ETH worth around $6.2 million as bounty if he or she complies with the terms of the settlement. “We have offered a time-sensitive whitehat settlement in exchange for the outstanding balance.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) all-time high has led to major inflows in crypto ETFs. On Thursday, May 22, net inflows for spot Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds were at more than $1 billion. This is the best performance that ETFs have seen since November 2024. Inflows in spot Bitcoin ETFs dominated, with a daily inflow of $934 million, which is their best performance since January 17. This brings the total assets under management of spot Bitcoin ETFs to $104 billion.

Ethereum ETFs see five days of positive inflows Ethereum ETFs, on the other hand, registered 110 million in net inflows, the biggest single-day gain since February 4.

2025-05-23T16:39:08.000Z,"Bad News from the US Treasury Secretary Regarding the US Sovereign Wealth Fund, Which Was Reportedly Planning to Purchase Bitcoin Too","US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the sovereign wealth fund plan launched at the behest of President Donald Trump has been suspended. “The sovereign wealth fund plan is on hold until we deal with all other issues,” Bessent said, announcing the government's changing priorities. It was said that the fund, which will be affiliated with the US government, could invest in cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin. Bessent also announced that several major trade deals are expected to be completed in the next few weeks. Related News: Watch Out: Binance's Altcoin Network BNB Chain Foundation Has Purchased These 4 Altcoins Trump had called for the U.S. to establish its own sovereign wealth fund in an executive order he signed on Feb. 3. The order instructed the Treasury Department and the Commerce Department to prepare a plan for the fund’s financing mechanisms, investment strategies, structure and governance model within 90 days. “We will create a great fortune for the fund,” Trump said in a statement that day. However, this ambitious plan has caused controversy in economic circles. Renowned economist Peter Schiff called the plan “absurd” and “unconstitutional,” while Robeco’s Colin Graham argued that such a fund was not economically sustainable due to the high level of the U.S. national debt ($36.22 trillion). Critics say the creation of the fund is a misplaced financial priority for a country with no national savings. Trump has suggested the fund could be financed through “smart” means, such as tariffs, but no specific source has yet been provided. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-23T16:35:39.000Z,"Pundit Says XRP Today’s Prices Are a Generational Entry, Compares XRP to Bitcoin at $0.05","Crypto commentator Dustin Layton is urging XRP holders not to underestimate the potential of their holdings amid current price stagnation. XRP is down 4% today, trading at $2.33, roughly the same level it held a month ago. This comes despite Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high near $112,000 on Thursday, with XRP failing to benefit meaningfully from the broader market momentum.Amid the price lull, influential voices within the XRP community are calling for patience. Layton drew a comparison between XRP's current position and Bitcoin’s early days.In a tweet, Layton highlighted how a mere $0.01 investment in Bitcoin during its infancy could be worth over $22,000 today, suggesting XRP may currently represent a similar opportunity.From a Penny to a FortuneLayton pointed to Bitcoin’s historical low of $0.04865 in July 2010. He noted that a $0.01 investment at that time would have procured 0.2 BTC. Fast forward to today, 15 years later, Bitcoin is trading at $111,000. That small, seemingly insignificant investment would now be worth $22,200.In perspective, this equates to a return on investment of over 2,281,602%, meaning just a $1 investment would now be worth over $2.28 million.The crypto analyst used this transformation to illustrate the power of early positioning in digital assets, showing how patience and foresight can yield dramatic results over time.XRP: Today’s Bitcoin?As a result, Layton encouraged XRP holders to recognize the asset's potential at current price levels. He suggested that buying XRP at under $5, or even $100, should be viewed in the same light as purchasing Bitcoin for less than a dollar.Edoardo Farina, founder of Alpha Lions Academy, has also urged XRP investors to maintain a long-term perspective amid price dips. Farina compared today’s XRP volatility to Bitcoin’s early years, citing how BTC surged from under $100 to over $96,000, a 96,000% gain. “Would it matter if you bought Bitcoin at $100 or $300?” he asked, implying that short-term XRP fluctuations are irrelevant if the asset follows a similar trajectory.These bold assertions come as XRP continues to trade significantly below its all-time high, with widespread apprehension about how long it will remain under its eight-year peak.Skeptics RemainWhile pro-XRP commentators frequently push the narrative that XRP could be the next Bitcoin , critics argue that XRP has been in the crypto market nearly as long as Bitcoin. If its market performance still lags so significantly, they say, it may not fit the narrative of being \""the next Bitcoin.\""Indeed, XRP launched in 2012, just three years after Bitcoin. Its lowest historical price was $0.002802 on July 7, 2014, four years after Bitcoin hit its bottom. Yet, relative to today’s price of $2.34, XRP has appreciated by 83,648%, a figure that pales in comparison to Bitcoin’s 2,281,602% rise.The Long-Term VisionStill, the prevailing narrative among XRP believers remains: \""early entry, long-term hold.\"" For instance, XRP community commentator BarriC recently stated that he hopes to take profit when XRP reaches $1,000. Moreover, some market watchers argue that XRP would have traded higher compared to Bitcoin if the SEC lawsuit had not happened. Now that the case is close to an end, they expect XRP to see an explosive run that could see it catch up.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/05/23/pundit-says-xrp-todays-prices-are-a-generational-entry-compares-xrp-to-bitcoin-at-0-05/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pundit-says-xrp-todays-prices-are-a-generational-entry-compares-xrp-to-bitcoin-at-0-05,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction",cryptocompare

2025-05-23T16:30:19.000Z,"Stablecoins Could Obliterate $7 Trillion In Global Costs—Anthony Scaramucci","Stablecoins could help the US keep its financial edge and lower global transaction fees, according to SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci. During an interview with CNBC this week, he said these dollar-pegged digital tokens aren’t just a crypto tool—they might be a way to boost the demand for US Treasuries and cut down on $7 trillion worth of annual global transaction costs. Scaramucci’s remarks came shortly after the US Senate advanced the GENIUS Act with a 66-22 vote, marking a rare moment of bipartisan agreement over how digital assets should be regulated. Stablecoins Backed By Treasuries Circle and Tether, two major players in the stablecoin space, are quietly buying up large amounts of US government debt. According to Scaramucci, Tether now holds more US Treasuries than countries like Germany or Japan. That’s a surprising twist. It means private crypto firms are now important holders of US debt, which could help support the dollar at a time when many countries are looking for alternatives. He also mentioned that upcoming rules could push stablecoin issuers to hold even more reserves in Treasuries. That would only deepen their connection to the US financial system. Political Momentum Builds In Washington While crypto regulation has often been a divisive issue in Washington, the GENIUS Act is starting to change that. A total of 16 Democrats joined Republicans to get the bill through the Senate, brushing aside earlier concerns about US President Donald Trump’s past support of digital currencies. David Sacks, a senior adviser to Trump on crypto and AI, told CNBC he’s confident the bill will keep moving forward. He said the White House expects more support as lawmakers look for ways to keep crypto innovation in the US instead of pushing it overseas. Real-World Uses For Stablecoins Scaramucci gave a practical example during his interview. He pointed to New York’s Hunt and Fish Club, where he believes stablecoins could replace credit cards. By doing that, businesses could skip the 2-3% fees charged by payment processors like Visa or Mastercard. He says this isn’t just a tech upgrade. It’s a way to make payments cheaper and faster for everyday purchases. Wire transfers and card payments rack up billions in fees each year, so stablecoins could be a cheaper option for many people around the world. A New Role For The Dollar This new push for stablecoins is also seen as a way to keep the dollar dominant in global finance. As countries test out their own digital currencies, the US is backing a different approach—letting private companies issue tokens backed by real dollars. With regulation finally gaining traction, stablecoins might soon play a bigger role not just in crypto, but in the larger financial system.

The BTC 4H RSI dropped to 48.63, signaling weakening momentum and rising bearish pressure. Markets now await the EU’s response as the June 1 tariff deadline approaches, raising fears of broader economic fallout. On May 23, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump posted on X , demanding a 50% tariff on European Union goods. He claimed EU trade policies had unfairly harmed U.S. companies. Trump cited corporate penalties, monetary manipulation, and lawsuits as key reasons. He added that talks were “going nowhere.” Trump proposed the tariff would take effect June 1, 2025.

2025-05-23T16:19:02.000Z,"On-Chain Data Signals This Bitcoin Bull Run Is Just Getting Started","Bitcoin’s latest surge has sparked renewed excitement across the crypto space. As the cryptocurrency hovers near its recently set all-time high, new data suggests changes in Bitcoin holder behavior and a strong potential for further gains throughout the week. Bitcoin Enters “Unprecedented” Bull Phase According to Santiment’s latest tweet , an important on-chain signal supporting this bullish momentum is the declining Mean Dollar Age of Bitcoin holdings, which reflects a younger average age of coins in circulation. This trend has historically aligned with major bull cycles. Over the past five years, there have been three major bull runs, and Santiment found that each has been accompanied by a noticeable drop in the average age of held BTC. Since April 16th, this metric has declined from 441 days to 429 days, which indicates that long-dormant whales are beginning to move their holdings. As these older coins re-enter active circulation, it strengthens the narrative that the market is in an “unprecedented” bull phase. In fact, this phase could possibly be one of the most significant in Bitcoin’s history. Further supporting this, Glassnode’s analysis revealed that despite Bitcoin’s ATH, realized profit-taking volume was just $1 billion, less than half the $2.10 billion seen when Bitcoin first crossed $100K in December 2024. Bitcoin Spent Volume in Profit by Age Bitcoin Climbs Global Asset Ranks Coin age distribution shows short-term traders dominating activity, with 6-month-old assets dropped to 13.4% from 24.7%. This indicates that long-term holders are broadly refraining from distributing coins at current levels, which is indicative of a stronger conviction and reduced speculative behavior. CryptoRank’s latest data highlighted a growing macro correlation. Bitcoin’s price movements increasingly mirror trends in the global M2 money supply. Now the fifth-largest asset by market capitalization, Bitcoin appears to be following broader liquidity patterns more closely. Global Money Supply/BTC Price The chart includes a 10-week forward projection of M2, historically a leading indicator for the cryptocurrency. This suggests that changes in global liquidity precede shifts in Bitcoin’s price. With the current M2 forecast pointing to continued growth, the data signals potential sustained upside for the cryptocurrency in the near term.

JASMY price technical analysis Jasmy price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that JASMY price has bounced back in the past few weeks, moving from a low of $0.00825 in April to $0.018. It flipped the crucial resistance level at $0.01620, its lowest point on November 4, into a new support. However, Jasmy has found resistance at the 200-day Exponential Moving Average. It has also formed a rising wedge pattern, a common bearish reversal sign. This pattern is made up of two ascending and converging trendlines. The MACD indicator points to a bearish divergence. Therefore, JasmyCoin price will likely have a bearish breakout in the coming weeks. If this happens, the next first target will be at $0.01620, followed by the psychological point at $0.0010.

2025-05-23T16:00:00.000Z,"When Will Altcoin Season Begin After Bitcoin Price Hit ATH Above $111,000?","Crypto analyst Astronomer has provided insights into when the altcoin season will likely begin following the Bitcoin price’s rally to a new all-time high (ATH). His analysis indicated that BTC’s dominance is about to top, which will pave the way for altcoins to outperform the flagship crypto. Altcoin Season To Begin Soon As Bitcoin Price Hits New ATH In an X post, Astronomer predicted that the altcoin season is imminent, seeing as BTC’s dominance (BTC.D) has hit 65% following the Bitcoin price rally to a new ATH. The analyst remarked that BTC’s dominance will roll over slowly first, before dropping rather quickly after the flagship crypto loses momentum. Related Reading: Is It Time For Altcoin Season? Bitcoin Dominance Rises To Major Rejection Zone He is also confident that the altcoin season is coming soon because BTC.D is up seven weeks in a row and all green from the bottom, which means the Bitcoin price-led move is stretching long. From a counting perspective, Astronomer remarked that BTC is coming to the end of the transition period, and altcoins will likely make their bigger moves soon. The analyst noted that BTC.D has also nicely retested the quarterly breaker open. For now, he believes sentiment is certainly not ready for an altcoin season, seeing as only the Bitcoin bulls are loud. Astronomer added that the ETH bulls are quiet and that only coins that are Bitcoin liquidity-driven are talked about, including HYPE, WIF, and the Bitcoin price itself. He is confident that 65% is the top for the BTC.D despite calls for 67% and 70%. With the Bitcoin price dominance currently at almost 63%, Astronomer affirmed that he is well-positioned for the top, with altcoin season coming after. The analyst stated that soon, these altcoins will put in their big moves until they are forced to become the narrative again, where they top out. Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto is also confident that the altcoin season is imminent amid the Bitcoin price’s rally to a new ATH. In an X post, he stated that where the market is headed in the coming months, every lagging altcoin is an opportunity to be thankful for, not a problem to be frustrated about. BTC Is Forming A Top At Current Price Levels In an X post, crypto analyst CryptoVerse stated that the Bitcoin price is likely forming a top at its current levels. He admitted that the flagship crypto could still rally to between $112,000 and $118,000 but warned that it could mark the cycle peak. The analyst also stated that he is not expecting an altcoin season before the fourth quarter of this year. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Chart Remains Very High Despite Crash, What This Means For Altcoins CryptoVerse remarked that based on global liquidity trends, the altcoin season should begin in the fourth quarter and wrap up by the second quarter of next year.

According to The Block, Ledn announced that it has switched to a fully collateralized Bitcoin lending system and ended its support for Ethereum in order to consolidate its BTC-focused business and further protect customer assets against credit risks. Accordingly, the company announced that it will stop supporting Ethereum-backed loans and BTC/ETH savings products as of July 1. The company also added that it will no longer lend out customer assets to earn interest. Ledn co-founder and CEO Adam Reeds said the move brings the company back to its roots and brings it more in line with Bitcoin’s founding principles. “With our new hyper-focus on bitcoin-only lending, we are returning to the roots and principles that originally inspired Bitcoin, Bitcoin was created as a direct response to the risks of fractional reserve banking and the uncontrolled use of client assets to generate interest. Traditional finance relies on the constant repurposing of client assets to create leverage and ultimately inflation. Bitcoin users instinctively reject this model. That’s why we’ve moved away from that approach entirely. With our retained credit structure, client assets stay where they belong and are held transparently.” *This is not investment advice.

Cetus protocol suffered a security breach that saw it lose over $200 million as perpetrators accessed its smart contracts. The team confirmed that the attacker siphoned $223 million from its smart contracts. The company is working to recover the stolen assets, with $162 million already frozen. The altcoin displays oversold conditions after substantial declines, signaling potential recoveries in the near term. Cetus trades at $0.1615, and confirming $0.1319 as support could trigger uptrends to $0.1922. That might attract more trading activity and volumes, supporting a potential 39.88% uptick from CETUS’ current price to the key resistance at $0.2259. Team’s swift response after exploit The hacking incident sparked widespread fears, which saw SUI plummet amidst broad-based rallies . However, the team reacted immediately, locking its smart contracts to prevent more losses. That saw it freezing $162 million of the stolen funds. The team also negotiated with the perpetrators to keep $6 million and return the remaining sum. Also, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao revealed plans to support Cetus’s recovery efforts. Cetus emphasized working with the Sui Foundation and other ecosystem participants to navigate recovery channels. Moreover, the project is working with law agencies to bolster retrieval efforts.

CETUS price outlook: bearish but bottoming The altcoin plunged swiftly to $0.1488 from $0.2556 minutes after the hacking incident. CETUS hovers at $0.1656 after a 3% bounce-back on its daily price chart. Chart by Coinmarketcap While its price action remains shaky with massive bearish pressure, technical indicators suggest a potential U-turn. Firstly, the Relative Strength Index’s reading of 28.50 places CETUS firmly in the oversold area. That indicates weakening bearish momentum and possible upside resurgences. The Average Direction Index is at 31.7, confirming that the downtrend could be approaching exhaustion. Moreover, the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) nears a crossover, signaling a potential momentum shift. Meanwhile, the 39% Bollinger band width hints at surging volatility, setting the ground for a massive price action in either direction. Stability beyond the $0.1319 support barrier would support an upswing to $0.1922. That might renew trader interest and catalyze a bull charge toward the key resistance at $0.2259. That would mean a 39.88% increase from CETUS’ current price. Factors such as the hacker accepting the offer to return the stolen assets could restore investor confidence and fuel the uptrend.

2025-05-23T15:32:03.000Z,"FBTC: Breaking Out On Fiat Fears","Summary FBTC made a new all-time high this week. The divergence from other risk assets suggests the move was driven by the Moody's downgrade. The downgrade reminds everyone why crypto is so appealing, but it is not likely to create a sustained divergence as the findings are not new. FBTC is long-term bullish, but I would be wary of chasing this break-out. The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ETF ( FBTC ) broke to new all-time highs this week, exceeding the $94.8 peak set in December of last year. This article explores the drivers behind the break-out, and why it may not be a good idea to chase the rally at these levels. A Quick Look at FBTC FBTC was launched in January 2024 and has become one of the most popular Bitcoin ETFs. Its low expense ratio of 0.25% and excellent liquidity are an attraction, as is the well-known and trusted name behind the product, \""Fidelity.\"" To be completely honest, there is very little to recommend it above its main competitor, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ), which has a slightly better performance (only 0.13% since inception and probably from a tracking error), and higher AUM. Seeking Alpha However, if you have a large exposure to Bitcoin, I would consider FBTC as an alternative to IBIT and spread the risk between the two funds. One consideration is that they have different custodians and Fidelity is self-custodian. Driving the Break-out FBTC often has a high-beta correlation to other risk assets such as stocks and the weakness in the S&P500 ( SPY ) in Q1 was replicated in FBTC. Both bottomed on the exact same day, April 7th. Data by YCharts There are periods where FBTC will out or under-perform due to various reasons. This was evident following the election when the new administration's crypto-friendly stance sparked a large rally. It was also the case this week as FBTC and SPY have moved in opposite directions and FBTC broke to a new all-time high. Seeking Alpha The driver this week appears to be Moody's downgrade of US government debt. This sparked a rise in yields as the risk of buying/holding US Treasuries has increased. It also dropped the US dollar, and it was notable that when stocks and bonds recovered on Monday 19th May (the first trading session after the downgrade was announced), the US dollar stayed weak. After a feeble recovery in May, it looks to be heading for further lows. TradingView Here is some of the rationale for the downgrade: Without adjustments to taxation and spending, we expect budget flexibility to remain limited, with mandatory spending, including interest expense, projected to rise to around 78% of total spending by 2035 from about 73% in 2024. If the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is extended, which is our base case, it will add around $4 trillion to the federal fiscal primary (excluding interest payments) deficit over the next decade. As a result, we expect federal deficits to widen, reaching nearly 9% of GDP by 2035, up from 6.4% in 2024, driven mainly by increased interest payments on debt, rising entitlement spending, and relatively low revenue generation. We anticipate that the federal debt burden will rise to about 134% of GDP by 2035, compared to 98% in 2024. And here's a shocking projection: Federal interest payments are likely to absorb around 30% of revenue by 2035, up from about 18% in 2024 and 9% in 2021. None of this is particularly new - Fitch, and Standard and Poor's already downgraded the credit rating years ago, and it was a matter of time before Moody's followed suit. But this puts some worrying calculations back in the spotlight. In the long term, the debt pile will erode the value of the dollar and all other fiat currencies. Crypto (and FBTC) is attractive as it has no sovereign risk, no debt, and no dilution. This is why it diverged from other risk assets this week and broke to a new all-time high. TradingView A Temporary Tailwind Breaking to new highs when stocks are moving in the other direction is impressive, but we don't want to see the two asset classes diverge for too long as they tend to rally and correct together over the longer term. TradingView A sustained period of FBTC outperformance would likely need a significant and new driver. A strategic Bitcoin reserve would fit the bill, but that now seems a dead-end given the project has to be budget-neutral. As already outlined, the reasons for the divergence this week are not new developments - crypto's main attraction has always been its independence from what many see as a doomed system of fiat currencies. Moody's downgrade may have brought some issues to the fore again, but nothing specific sparked the move. In short, I do not expect the divergence to last very long, and since stocks look to be rolling over - or at least unlikely to break to new highs any time soon - the break-out in FBTC may also stall. As I am writing this, I see both stocks and bitcoin have dropped as President Trump has threatened the EU with 50% tariffs. This isn't necessarily bearish, but we may see a consolidation like we did the last time Bitcoin approached a previous all-time high. The current pattern and the larger-scale pattern from 2022-2025 are quite similar. TradingView Implications The main takeaway is to not get carried away with this break-out. The outlook for FBTC is bullish, but I would not rush in to buy at new all-time highs. A pullback to the gap around $85 would be a more compelling buying opportunity over the summer. For those holding long-term, this week's developments underpin why crypto is a good investment, but don't really change anything. Conclusions FBTC and stocks diverged this week following the Moody's downgrade. While the rally was welcome for bitcoin bulls, the drivers do not look like igniting a sustained divergence as the downgrade was expected and not due to anything particularly new. Without a \""risk on\"" environment that also lifts stocks, the break-out may not be sustained and a drift-down/consolidation looks likely. FBTC is long-term bullish, and I rate it a \""hold,\"" but I would wait to initiate new positions nearer $85.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4789475-fbtc-breaking-out-on-fiat-fears?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING","FBTC",cryptocompare

2025-05-23T15:29:19.000Z,"BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF Dethrones VOO to Become Top ETF in Daily Flows for the First Time","On May 22, the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) topped all U.S.-listed exchange-traded funds in daily inflows for the first time, dethroning VOO. Notably, it surpassed longstanding leaders such as Vanguard’s S&P 500 ETF (VOO) and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV). According to Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas, this marked a significant milestone, fueled by what he described as a \""feeding frenzy\"" in response to the new price highs.https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1925883102829670726Specifically, the IBIT ETF saw a single-day inflow of $877.18 million, contributing to approximately $8 billion in total inflows over the past five weeks.According to Bitwise President Teddy Fusaro, the performance of Bitcoin ETFs suggests their market introduction has been among the most successful in ETF history based on asset accumulation and inflow metrics to date.ETF Flow Rankings Shift Amid Bitcoin RallyThis record-setting day pushed IBIT to the top of the ETF inflow leaderboard. Over the last month alone, the fund accumulated more than $7.5 billion, reflecting strong market interest in digital asset-backed products. Balchunas added that May 21 marked IBIT’s second-highest trading volume ever, closely trailing activity from January 23—another date aligned with a Bitcoin all-time high. Additionally, lifetime net flows for all Bitcoin ETFs combined have now reached $44.5 billion, signaling their growing presence in traditional portfolios.Meanwhile, Treasury bond ETFs also saw elevated demand. iShares’ TLT ETF, which targets long-duration U.S. government bonds, posted $851.83 million in daily inflows and more than $2.2 billion for the week. While not surpassing IBIT, this performance indicates growing investor interest in duration exposure, potentially due to evolving interest rate expectations or broader risk management strategies. Notably, VOO remained strong with $558.06 million in daily inflows and $14.66 billion over the last month.Institutional MomentumCoinShares data for the week ending May 19 further supports the bullish trend, showing iShares ETFs in the U.S. leading with $907.80 million in weekly inflows. Month-to-date, iShares pulled in $2.98 billion, bringing the year-to-date total to $9.04 billion. The product now manages over $69 billion in total assets under management (AUM).In contrast, Grayscale Investments LLC continued to experience net outflows. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) recorded $42.46 million in outflows over the week, with monthly losses of $152.77 million and year-to-date net redemptions totaling $1.62 billion. Despite managing $29.67 billion in AUM, these figures suggest a notable rotation away from higher-cost legacy products toward newer, lower-fee alternatives.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/05/23/blackrocks-ishares-bitcoin-trust-etf-dethrones-voo-to-become-top-etf-in-daily-flows-for-the-first-time/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=blackrocks-ishares-bitcoin-trust-etf-dethrones-voo-to-become-top-etf-in-daily-flows-for-the-first-time,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Market|Bitcoin ETF|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today|Latest BlackRock News Updates Today",cryptocompare
2025-05-23T15:28:51.000Z,"3 Undervalued Cryptos Set To Skyrocket: Cardano, Remittix and Dogecoin","The post 3 Undervalued Cryptos Set To Skyrocket: Cardano, Remittix and Dogecoin appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News When there’s an altcoin bull market, returns can be astronomical if you position yourself with the right, undervalued crypto. In this article, we’ll look at three alts that we think could perform exponentially. New token Remittix , whose presale has taken the market by storm. Also, older and more established altcoins Cardano and Dogecoin, both of which have potential as mainstream adoption continues. All three have great potential, but let’s see why. Remittix Set to Explode Higher as Presale Success Generates Market Excitement Remittix is already one of the most exciting projects in crypto right, while its presale is still ongoing. Since launching at just $0.015, $RTX has skyrocketed over 400% and has a local price of $0.0781, at time of writing. With over $15.3 million raised and growing investor interest, Remittix is being touted as a market leader after it launches its mainnet. But what is it about Remittix that’s caught so much attention so early? The platform is built using a PayFi protocol, which enables users to send crypto to a bank account. Over 40 different cryptocurrencies and 30 different fiat currencies are available and with no FX fees, it’s cheaper and faster, making Remittix a more efficient option compared with existing payment solutions. With its mainnet launch on the horizon, excitement is building. Analysts have been bullish since it was first announced, but the presale has exceeded all expectations. As the presale nears its final stages, Remittix could be a powerful force in the next wave of crypto adoption, and with it being so early, it could be at least 50X from here. Cardano Could Explode Higher as it Integrates Bitcoin DeFi Cardano is beginning to gain traction ahead of its May 27 update, which will enable Bitcoin DeFi integration. This is expected to make Cardano a serious player in the DeFi space. Founder Charles Hoskinson confirmed , “Taproot enables Bitcoin to generate yields, unlocking new revenue paths for holders.” This integration will make Cardano a bridge between Bitcoin and smart contracts, which could attract billions in BTC liquidity. The price is responding, as we can see on the daily chart: ADA has formed a textbook Cup and Handle pattern, suggesting continued upside. source Dogecoin Breakout Holds Despite SEC ETF Delay The SEC has postponed its ruling on Grayscale’s proposed Dogecoin Trust ETF, citing ongoing caution around altcoins and memecoins. Despite this, however, Dogecoin’s technical setup remains bullish and has broken above a year-long trendline, which could mean a possible long-term trend reversal. According to analyst Marco Polo , “The breakout from the falling wedge marks a significant shift in trend.” source DOGE currently holds support at $0.217, with short-term targets at $0.27 and $0.30 within sight. Resistance could hit toward $0.35 and $0.45, but if the market remains bullish, then the Dogecoin price could rip. Conclusion When alt season kicks in, it’s time to strap in and enjoy the ride. Unlike previous cycles, not every altcoin will rip so making sure you’re positioned with something that offers utility is essential. Remittix is what DeFi has long promised and is exciting for any investor. Cardano could be the platform that handles Bitcoin DeFi and if it does, then the price might be dwarfed by the cycle peak. Also, never write off Dogecoin because although memecoins are infamous for their lack of utility, Dogecoin boasts brand recognition, which plays a big role in the memecoin space.

2025-05-23T15:25:09.000Z,"Bitcoin Open Interest Hits New ATH Above $80B","Bitcoin open interest has claimed a new all-time high amid bullish bets on higher prices despite the recent pullback. The correction comes on the back of a renewed escalation of the trade war, as President Donald Trump recently threatened to impose a 50% tariff on all EU imports and a 25% tariff on Apple products unless iPhones are produced domestically. Bitcoin Open Interest Hits ATH Despite Fresh PullbackIn response, Bitcoin dropped drastically after recently hitting a new all-time high close to $112,000. Notably, from a peak of $111,176 earlier today, the crypto firstborn collapsed to an intraday low of $107,367, marking a sharp 3.43% drop in under two hours. This represented one of Bitcoin's sharpest slumps in recent times. Bitcoin 15m Chart Bitcoin 15m Chart However, it saw an immediate recovery shortly after. Despite the rebound effort, the asset is still suffering from the recent crash, posting a 1.83% loss on the day, as the bears threaten to trigger Bitcoin's largest losing day since April 13.Also, the broader crypto market reacted bearishly, with the global crypto market cap losing a whopping $107.61 billion within three hours today. Nonetheless, despite the fresh bearishness, reports from Bloomberg confirm that bulls remain unbothered, as Bitcoin open interest has continued to spike today. Interestingly, data from Coinglass indicates that Bitcoin open interest hit $80.16 billion today. This represents an increase of over $2 billion from the figure recorded yesterday, May 22, and marks a new all-time high for Bitcoin open interest in the futures market. Bitcoin Open Interest Coinglass Bitcoin Open Interest | Coinglass Bitcoin Open Interest Skews BullishThe Bloomberg report also highlighted data from Deribit suggesting that this surge in Bitcoin's open interest skews mainly toward bullish sentiment.Notably, an investigation carried out by The Crypto Basic confirmed this. Specifically, for the June 27 expiration data, the total call open interest is 66,510 contracts, out of which 17,717 are ITM (in-the-money) and 48,793 are OTM (out-of-the-money). This corresponds to a notional value of about $7.29 billion for calls, with OTM calls representing over 73% of that. On the put side, the total open interest is 36,663 contracts, with only 1,489 ITM and 35,174 OTM, making nearly 96% of puts OTM. Essentially, the notional value for puts is $4.02 billion. Bitcoin Options Deribit Bitcoin Options | Deribit Combined, the puts and calls give a total notional value of $11.31 billion, with most of it, over 81%, in out-of-the-money contracts. This means most of the capital is betting on large moves that have not yet materialized. Importantly, calls make up the larger portion of both open interest and notional value, suggesting a skew toward bullish positioning.From a sentiment standpoint, this data leans bullish. The dominance of call options over puts, especially with the large number of OTM calls, indicates that more market participants are expecting higher Bitcoin prices by late June.Other Bullish MetricsIn addition, institutional interest in Bitcoin through the ETF products is through the roof. Yesterday, total net inflows into Bitcoin ETFs hit a high of $934.74 million, according to data from Sosovalue. This represented the highest intraday net flow this month, bringing total assets in these products to $134.3 billion.

2025-05-23T15:23:40.000Z,"Expert Says Trump’s 50% Tariff on EU Imports Presents Dip Opportunity for Bitcoin and Altcoins","Popular market veteran Michaël Van de Poppe remains unshaken by the recent market correction, predicting that this panic moment would soon provide massive returns. The broader crypto market experienced a major dip after President Donald Trump slapped a 50% tariff on all imports from the European Union. Earlier this week, the prices of major crypto assets surged tremendously thanks to a Bitcoin-led relief rally. Following the recent surge, Bitcoin set a new all-time high (ATH) record of $111,970 yesterday, May 22. Altcoins followed suit and also saw slight gains. Trump Announces 50% Tariffs on EU Imports However, the rally was short-lived. The broader financial markets, including crypto, tanked after Trump floated a plan to impose a 50% tariff on imports from the EU region. In a Truth Social post, President Trump disclosed that dealing with the EU has been challenging lately. According to him, the region’s policy, including its VAT taxes, trade barriers, monetary manipulations, and unfair lawsuits against American companies, have caused the U.S. an annual deficit of $250 million. He emphasized that this $250 million deficit is unacceptable, adding that recent discussions with the EU have ended in futility. As a result, he imposed a 50% tariff on all imports from the EU starting June 1, 2025. Notably, he clarified that the 50% tariff would not apply to goods manufactured by EU companies in the U.S. https://twitter.com/thecryptobasic/status/1925902103764943214Cryptos React As expected, Trump’s 50% tariffs on EU imports spooked the financial markets, including crypto and stocks. Investors feared the move could result in a trade war between the EU and the U.S. This prompted many investors to sell their crypto holdings, leading to a broader market crash. Specifically, Bitcoin, which traded around the $110,000 mark earlier today, slumped to around $107,400 in reaction to the tariff news. Although Bitcoin rebounded almost immediately to $109,500, the premier crypto is still down 2.2% from its new ATH. Van de Poppe Remains UnfazedMeanwhile, many stakeholders remain unfazed by the Trump-driven bloodbath across the crypto market. Interestingly, veteran market analyst Michaël Van de Poppe is one of those who do not seem troubled by the latest crash. The crypto expert emphasized that the recent market crash allows investors to scoop Bitcoin and altcoins at lower prices. He recounted how the crypto market rebounded sharply in the past sell-offs experienced a few months ago. For context, Trump’s trade war started on his first day in office, January 20, 2025. It initially started as a threat after he was sworn in as the 47th President of the United States. However, he followed through by issuing executive orders on February 1, slapping high tariffs on goods imported from several countries, including China, Canada, and Mexico. These countries retaliated by also imposing tariffs on U.S. goods. However, Trump continued to raise duties and eventually imposed a 145% tariff on China imports, while the latter reciprocated with a 125% tariff on goods from the United States. This trade war crashed the prices of major financial instruments, including Bitcoin. The premier crypto, which hit $109,114 on January 20, eventually crashed to $74,000 three months later, specifically on April 9, 2025. Interestingly, crypto prices have soared ever since Trump announced a 90-day pause on all reciprocal tariffs in April. Amid this favorable market condition, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $111,970 yesterday. Although the top crypto has slumped to around $109,500 due to Trump’s latest tariff on EU goods, Poppe sees this dip as an opportunity to buy BTC at low prices in anticipation of an imminent rally.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/05/23/expert-says-trumps-50-tariff-on-eu-imports-presents-dip-opportunity-for-bitcoin-and-altcoins/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=expert-says-trumps-50-tariff-on-eu-imports-presents-dip-opportunity-for-bitcoin-and-altcoins,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION","Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today|Latest Donald Trump News",cryptocompare

2025-05-23T15:17:50.000Z,"Solana Emerges as Contender In Real World Asset Tokenisation?","The tokenisation of real-world assets (RWAs), the process of representing ownership of physical or even intangible assets via digital tokens, is undergoing a notable shift as Solana gains traction as a new blockchain for emerging RWA applications. While Ethereum has traditionally been the dominant platform due to its extensive infrastructure, developer base, and early adoption by institutions like JPMorgan and BlackRock, its limitations in scalability and cost have prompted a pivot. Solana, with its high throughput, low transaction fees, and rapidly maturing ecosystem, has attracted projects such as Homebase and Credix, which require efficient, real-time asset interaction. Amid the fray is also the Liquid Network, which has also had success in attracting projects such as MikroKapital, USTBL and the Blockstream Mining Note, and which is more conservative and purpose driven and embodies the principles of Bitcoin. As institutions explore scalable alternatives, Solana is positioning itself as another credible complement to Ethereum’s legacy role, and Liquid’s Bitcoin focused approach, offering performance advantages for operationally intensive and cost-sensitive RWA deployments. This evolving landscape suggests a growing multi-chain future for asset tokenisation, shaped by the differing strengths of each platform. The rise of Solana Real World Asset Tokenisation Tokenisation of real-world assets (RWAs) refers to the process of representing ownership rights to tangible or even intangible items, ranging from real estate, commodities, to even intellectual property, using digital tokens on a blockchain. This transformation allows for fractional ownership, global transferability, and increased liquidity of assets that are traditionally illiquid or difficult to access. The concept has gained traction across financial institutions and tech-forward enterprises due to its potential to streamline asset management, reduce reliance on intermediaries, and democratise investment opportunities. Tokenisation also introduces programmability into asset ownership, enabling automated compliance, dividends, and governance through smart contracts. Venues such as Bitfinex Securities now provide opportunities for both issuers of tokenised securities to raise capital through this asset class, and for investors to get access to investments that may not have been traditionally available to them. In recent years, RWA tokenisation has become a notable area of experimentation within legacy finance, seeking to modernise infrastructure and unlock new efficiencies. Institutions such as BlackRock, JPMorgan , and the European Investment Bank have explored on-chain representations of traditional securities, treasury instruments, and commercial assets. Much of this early activity has gravitated towards Ethereum, owing to its dominant position as the leading smart contract platform and its extensive ecosystem of Decentralised Finance (DeFi) protocols. Ethereum’s established infrastructure, network effects, and developer community made it the de facto standard for pilot RWA initiatives, despite its known limitations around transaction costs and throughput. However, the landscape is shifting. Solana has emerged as a serious contender in the RWA space, offering faster transaction speeds, significantly lower fees, and a growing suite of infrastructure tailored to institutional needs. As more RWA use cases demand real-time settlement, microtransactions, and scalable on-chain interactions, Solana’s performance characteristics have attracted attention from both startups and traditional financial players. Its compatibility with token extensions, oracles, and permissioned environments adds further appeal to developers seeking flexibility without sacrificing speed or cost-efficiency. Projects like Homebase (real estate), Baxus (luxury goods), and Credix (private credit) exemplify how tokenisation is rapidly diversifying on Solana. The Liquid Network, a Bitcoin sidechain developed by Blockstream, presents a distinctive alternative for real-world asset tokenisation when compared to Ethereum and Solana. While Ethereum dominates through its mature ecosystem and general-purpose smart contract functionality, and Solana appeals with its high throughput and low-cost infrastructure optimised for scalable applications, Liquid offers a more conservative but purpose-driven model rooted in Bitcoin’s principles. Liquid’s design philosophy prioritises security, minimalism, and trust minimisation in line with Bitcoin’s original objectives. Unlike Ethereum and Solana, which embrace expressive programmability and complex DeFi composability, Liquid adopts a more constrained scripting environment that emphasises predictable execution, deterministic outcomes, and confidential transactions. Its architecture is oriented around reducing reliance on third parties through mechanisms like Partially Signed Elements Transactions (PSET) and confidential assets, aligning with Bitcoin’s focus on peer-to-peer integrity and auditability without sacrificing privacy. This approach makes Liquid particularly suited for financial applications that value reliability, discretion, and adherence to Bitcoin-native paradigms over rapid iteration or maximal flexibility. Liquid supports confidential transactions, native asset issuance, and covenant-based smart contracting via the Elements platform. These capabilities enable trust-minimised asset swaps and options contracts without relying on third-party enforcement, a feature that aligns with the network’s focus on financial sovereignty and interoperability. Unlike Ethereum’s broad programmability and Solana’s composable DeFi environment, Liquid emphasises deterministic, privacy-conscious execution and settlement finality. This makes it well-suited for RWA use cases where confidentiality, regulatory clarity, and predictable behaviour outweigh the need for maximal flexibility or composability. This has attracted issuers such as USTBL (tokenised US treasury bills), MikroKapital (tokenised microfinance bonds) and the Blockstream Mining Note (Bitcoin hashrate contract). Though not as widely adopted as its counterparts, Liquid’s architecture is appealing to institutions and developers seeking Bitcoin-native infrastructure for RWAs that balances smart contract functionality with auditability and reduced counterparty risk. The broader trend suggests that the tokenisation of RWAs is no longer confined to Ethereum’s boundaries. While Ethereum remains central to DeFi and legacy onboarding, Solana’s momentum is a reflection of evolving user expectations around usability, latency, and transaction cost. As regulatory clarity improves and financial products evolve to meet blockchain-native standards, competition between ecosystems may further accelerate innovation. In this context, Solana’s rise highlights not just a technical advantage, but a paradigm shift in how financial markets might adopt public infrastructure for real-world applications. How Does Tokenisation of RWAs on Solana Compare to Similar Efforts on other blockchains? The tokenisation of real-world assets (RWAs) across platforms like Ethereum, Solana, and Liquid Network reveals differing strategic approaches to integrating traditional finance into blockchain systems. Ethereum has historically led in this space, thanks to its mature smart contract functionality, expansive developer ecosystem, and deep integration with the decentralised finance (DeFi) sector. Early RWA ventures, including tokenised bonds, real estate, and credit markets, gravitated toward Ethereum due to its EVM-based tooling and established liquidity. In contrast, Liquid takes a more focused route by leveraging Bitcoin’s underlying principles, prioritising deterministic execution and confidential transactions through specialised scripting and covenants. While Liquid lacks Ethereum’s general-purpose programmability, it offers a simpler, security-oriented environment for specific RWA use cases like options and swaps. Despite its early dominance, Ethereum’s throughput limitations and volatile transaction fees have made scalability a persistent concern for RWA developers. High-frequency trading or real-time asset evaluation becomes costly and cumbersome on Layer 1, prompting migrations to Layer 2s that often fragment liquidity and tooling. Solana addresses this with its high-throughput, low-cost design, enabling direct deployment of performance-intensive RWA applications without relying on auxiliary layers. Meanwhile, Liquid operates with an entirely different set of trade-offs, focusing on privacy-preserving swaps and low-trust financial contracts through the PSET standard. While it doesn’t compete on speed with Solana or composability with Ethereum, Liquid’s design is suited for scenarios where bilateral settlement integrity and regulatory simplicity are paramount. Solana’s architecture, with its single-shard execution and purpose-built token primitives, has evolved to accommodate increasingly sophisticated RWA deployments. Features like token extensions allow developers to enforce transfer restrictions, automate interest logic, and integrate compliance directly at the token level. This level of protocol-native enforcement offers an alternative to Ethereum’s reliance on external contracts and middleware. Liquid, while not as expressive in programmability, offers unique benefits such as confidential asset issuance and deterministic settlement logic, which can be advantageous for institutions with stricter audit and reporting requirements. Where Solana emphasises real-time interaction and high-frequency performance, Liquid offers predictable, low-risk contract execution anchored in Bitcoin’s security model. Ethereum continues to be the preferred platform for institutional RWA pilots, largely due to its regulatory familiarity, audit-ready tooling, and market inertia. Solana is rapidly catching up in terms of developer engagement and infrastructure readiness, particularly in emerging sectors requiring agile settlement layers. Liquid, while less prominent in institutional headlines, appeals to actors prioritising minimised counterparty risk and conservative deployment logic, especially in sectors like private bilateral markets or security token issuance. Although Liquid lacks the vast app ecosystems of Ethereum or Solana, it offers an alternative that may appeal to institutions already aligned with Bitcoin-native infrastructure or that favour minimal exposure to open DeFi environments. Which Way are Institutions Leaning for Their RWA Infrastructure Needs? Institutional adoption of RWA tokenisation has so far aligned with Ethereum’s stability and compliance-focused ecosystem. Major institutions like BlackRock and JPMorgan have piloted their tokenisation efforts on Ethereum or Ethereum-compatible chains, capitalising on the familiarity of the EVM and the established legal frameworks built around it. Liquid, while not yet a common destination for large institutional RWA programmes, is growing fast, recently surpassing more than $3bn in terms of TVL as demand for regulated asset tokenisation increases. It provides robust primitives for asset issuance and trust-minimised options, and its alignment with Bitcoin may position it well for future use in conservative financial sectors or regulated custody environments. Compared to Solana’s experimental flexibility, which does carry elements of risk if smart contracts fail or are hacked, Liquid positions itself as a lower-friction toolset for predictable, narrow-scope deployments. Ethereum’s scalability bottlenecks have pushed many institutions toward Layer 2s or sidechains, but these solutions can introduce complexity and dilute the core benefits of ecosystem composability. Solana sidesteps these challenges by delivering low fees and high speed at the base layer, though its trade-off comes in the form of reduced decentralisation. Liquid, on the other hand, avoids these scaling debates entirely by narrowing its focus: it does not aim to host a wide range of general-purpose applications but instead delivers precise functionality for confidential settlement and atomic swaps. While Liquid may not appeal to institutions seeking open-ended programmability, it offers a cleaner, more deterministic foundation for discrete asset settlement processes. Solana’s increasing appeal among newer institutions and fintech operators stems from its responsiveness to high-volume, low-latency needs. Applications in sectors like private credit, commodities, and real estate are particularly suited to Solana’s infrastructure. Liquid serves a different niche, enabling trust-minimised interactions via tools like atomic swaps and fully collateralised options contracts, often in contexts where participants already operate within Bitcoin-oriented frameworks or require confidentiality. Unlike Solana, Liquid does not focus on open composability but rather on discrete, verifiable outcomes. This makes it less visible in the generalised RWA discourse but no less relevant for particular applications that value privacy and contract simplicity over throughput. The landscape is fragmenting by function. Ethereum remains the institutional default, anchoring large-scale, high-value, slow-moving asset structures with extensive legal and compliance integrations. Solana is absorbing developer mindshare for RWAs requiring speed and frequent state changes. Liquid, though operating in a quieter corner of the ecosystem, provides a foundation for private, bilateral settlement infrastructure, suited to niche use cases where regulatory simplicity, determinism, or Bitcoin-compatibility matter more than feature richness. As RWA tokenisation continues to evolve, it’s likely that each platform will solidify its role in a broader, complementary multi-chain architecture, one where Liquid coexists with Ethereum and Solana, serving specific operational or regulatory needs.

Here’s why","XRP, the digital asset associated with Ripple Labs, is once again in the spotlight, not due to courtroom headlines this time, but for its impressive technical performance. According to respected market analyst CrediBULL Crypto , XRP is currently showing what he calls the “cleanest lower timeframe impulsive structure” among all altcoins — a statement that has stirred renewed optimism among XRP holders and technical traders alike. As excited as I am about my other holdings and their upside potential in the coming months, there is still no other alt-coin in this space that has lower timeframe impulsive structure as clean as $XRP has had off of it's lows. The chop/consolidation we are seeing on $XRP in the… https://t.co/sM4zJgK378 — CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) May 22, 2025 A Textbook Impulsive Wave in Formation CrediBULL Crypto shared his insights in a recent post on the social platform X, where he emphasized that XRP’s recent price action of its local lows is setting up a potentially powerful bullish continuation. He described the structure as “impulsive,” a term used in Elliott Wave Theory to define strong directional moves often seen in trending markets. According to him, XRP’s recent upward trajectory demonstrates a classic five-wave pattern that indicates the end of a corrective phase and the beginning of a much larger advance. What makes XRP’s current structure especially compelling, he explains, is its clarity and precision on the lower timeframes — specifically the 4-hour chart. In contrast to other altcoins which show choppier or more ambiguous setups, XRP has maintained a well-defined wave structure with minimal overlap, signaling strong underlying demand and momentum. The Power of Consolidation in the $2 Range A key part of CrediBULL’s bullish case for XRP lies in its ongoing consolidation around the $2 price range. While some traders may interpret this sideways movement as indecision or weakness, CrediBULL argues that it is actually a healthy sign. Tight consolidations, particularly following impulsive advances, often act as launchpads for the next leg up. In technical terms, they are known to build the energy needed for a breakout — especially when volume remains steady and sellers fail to drive prices meaningfully lower. He likens this phase of consolidation to the price action witnessed in Bitcoin during its last major rally, where BTC moved from around $25,000 to its all-time high near $74,000. That explosive Wave 3 move, as per Elliott Wave Theory, followed a similar prolonged consolidation. If XRP follows a comparable trajectory, the current price action could precede a significant Wave 3 of its own, which traditionally is the strongest and longest wave in a five-wave impulse sequence. Key Support and Resistance Levels to Watch CrediBULL also highlighted important price levels that could influence XRP’s short-term and medium-term outlook. Support in the $1.77 range is seen as crucial; maintaining above this level signals strength and continued accumulation. On the upside, breaking out above resistance near $3.21 would likely confirm the next leg up and potentially validate the beginning of the next impulsive wave. That said, failure to hold above key support — specifically the $1.05 threshold — could delay the bullish scenario, possibly leading to a deeper correction before any major continuation. Still, the technical structure remains intact unless lower timeframe dynamics drastically shift. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Context and Institutional Tailwinds The growing attention around XRP’s chart comes at a time of rising institutional interest in the asset. Just days ago, Robinhood listed the first U.S.-based XRP futures ETF under the ticker XRPI, bringing the digital asset into the portfolios of mainstream investors. Such developments are adding new layers of credibility to XRP and supporting the long-term bullish outlook shared by traders like CrediBULL Crypto. With XRP’s fundamentals gaining strength and its technical picture aligning with high-probability bullish structures, the current market setup is one of anticipation. Traders and analysts will be closely monitoring price behavior in the days and weeks ahead, especially as the asset tests the upper boundaries of its consolidation range. A Setup Worth Watching While many altcoins exhibit potential in this ongoing bull cycle, few have displayed the type of clean, impulsive structure that XRP has shown, according to CrediBULL Crypto. His analysis, grounded in classical wave theory and supported by strong technical patterns, paints a bullish scenario that appears increasingly likely with each passing day of consolidation. If XRP delivers on the promise of its current structure, the explosive breakout that follows may not only reward those who remained patient — it could also cement XRP’s role as a cornerstone asset in the next phase of crypto market expansion.

2025-05-23T15:16:17.000Z,"First US XRP Futures ETFs Launch on Nasdaq Amid High Demand","First US XRP Futures ETFs to List on Nasdaq with Robust Demand The long-awaited arrival of XRP futures ETFs in the United States has finally arrived. Nasdaq welcomed the introduction of two new funds: XRPI and XRPT on Thursday, a landmark moment for Ripple's natively-held asset as well as the broader crypto investment landscape. With the demand for regulated cryptocurrency products still simmering, along with the fierce debate over the future of spot XRP ETFs, the attention now is on how these futures-backed funds may shape the next era for XRP. A New Age for XRP Investing For years, U.S. investors have been relegated to a hodgepodge of regulatory barriers and limited options if they wish to gain exposure to XRP. The launch of XRPI and XRPT flips that script on its head with a regulated, open means to get exposure to the price movement of XRP in futures contracts. Both funds track the performance of XRP futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the same manner very popular Bitcoin futures ETFs function. The timing could not be more perfect. XRP has seen renewed demand in 2025, driven by Ripple's ongoing litigation victories and a broader renaissance in the crypto universe. The introduction of these ETFs not only legitimates XRP as an institutional and retail-trading worthy investment but also reflects growing demand for diversified exposure to crypto beyond Ethereum and Bitcoin. How the Funds Work: Fees, Liquidity, and Providers XRPI and XRPT were designed to be transparent and accessible. Both funds charge a competitive 0.95% management fee, which is in line with other crypto futures ETFs. Both funds are backed by a suite of leading market makers and liquidity providers, delivering tight spreads and deep order books on Nasdaq from launch. Institutional investors have already been showing keen interest, with pre-market data signaling strong inflows and trading volumes. The fund issuers have collaborated with top custodians and compliance firms to ensure that all positions are fully collateralized and that investor assets are protected in line with U.S. regulatory platforms. Will a Futures ETF Open the Door to a Spot Product? The launch of XRPI and XRPT has fueled speculation that a physically-backed XRP ETF becomes a reality. Market experts cite the SEC approval of these futures instruments as probable spotlights on making the way for a physically-backed XRP ETF in the near term, possibly following the lead of Bitcoin ETFs. It is seen as a sign of faith in the market maturity of XRP and its ability to attract significant institutional funding by most. Others presume that the introduction of futures-traded ETFs could stabilize XRP's notoriously volatile price action by providing liquidity and drawing in a new group of investors. Others caution that, while regulated, futures products pose potential risk such as tracking error and contango that can impact returns compared to outright spot exposure. The $8 Question: Can ETFs Take XRP to New Heights? Most debated, perhaps, among analysts and traders is whether or not the listing of these ETFs can be the catalyst that sends XRP to that much-anticipated $8 price level. While the road to such a level is paved with skepticism, it cannot be dismissed that the psychological effect of a big ETF listing has. History from Bitcoin and Ethereum futures ETFs suggests that increased accessibility and institutional participation can drive both liquidity and price appreciation. But skeptics point out that macroeconomic environments, regulatory innovations, and general sentiment in the cryptocurrency markets will still be determinative of XRP's trajectory. Launching the futures ETF is a major milestone, but no free ride to the moon. What It Means for Crypto Markets The listing of XRPI and XRPT on Nasdaq at the same time as record-breaking open interest in Bitcoin options and increasing activity in crypto derivatives markets comes at a time of sky-high trader sentiment, with Bitcoin itself remaining around the $111,000 level and open interest at historic highs. The successful launch of XRP futures ETFs would take this momentum to an even higher level, providing another layer of sophistication and diversification for the U.S. crypto investment market. As investors and traders take in this new reality, all eyes will be on XRPI and XRPT's performance in their initial weeks of trade—and if and how their success can finally place XRP in the upper echelons of digital currencies.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9246/first-us-xrp-futures-et-fs-launch-on-nasdaq-amid-high-demand,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","News|Ripple",cryptocompare

Here Are the Details","Another historic milestone has passed in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin (BTC) has become the world’s fifth most valuable asset, exceeding $2.2 trillion in market value for the first time this week, thanks to its strong rally. Bitcoin Market Cap Surpasses $2.2 Trillion: New Peak in Institutional Interest, Options Market Points to More Bitcoin has thus overtaken giants such as Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG), while falling behind only tech giants such as Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA), as well as gold with an estimated value of around $22 trillion. BTC’s strong price movement around $110,000 is supported by intense buying across all investor groups, from whales to individual investors. This positive atmosphere in the market is interpreted as an indication that Bitcoin is increasingly being adopted in the traditional financial world. With one week left until the May option expiration date, most investors have taken positions in call options at $110,000. In June options, it is noteworthy that call positions of $200,000 and $300,000 are concentrated. This reveals the market's expectation that the upward potential will continue. Institutional Players and ETF Demand at Peak MicroStrategy (MSTR) has announced a new $2.1 billion perpetual preferred stock offering to continue its Bitcoin investments. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) fund received $877 million in inflows on Thursday alone, bringing its total net inflow to $47.6 billion, indicating strong institutional investor interest in the ETF. Decoupling From Traditional Markets: Is Bitcoin Becoming a Macro Hedge? On the macroeconomic front, Bitcoin is clearly different from traditional assets. In the last five days, BTC is up 5%, while the S&P 500 is down more than 1%. This negative correlation shows that Bitcoin stands out as a “macro hedge”. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-23T15:05:02.000Z,"‘Legendary Gains or Legendary Regrets:’ Crucial Guidance to Investors After Bitcoin’s New ATH","TL;DR BTC’s price has been flying high recently, but one well-known analyst recommended that people seize the opportunity to make some profits. Strong inflows into spot ETFs and negative exchange netflows support the thesis of a further upside, but “Extreme Greed” signals a rising risk of a reversal. The Important Advice Bitcoin (BTC) has taken center stage in the past few days, with its price exploding to a new all-time high of almost $112,000. The historic peak occurred on May 22, a date known in the crypto space as BTC Pizza Day. Despite retracing below $109,000 following the threat of a renewed tariff war between the USA and the European Union (EU), the primary cryptocurrency remains well in the green on a weekly scale. That said, some analysts, such as the X user Merlijn The Trader, urged investors to take some profits and not only screenshot the historical charts as they “won’t pay the bills.” He also claimed that the “legendary gains” could turn into “legendary regrets” for those who miss the current opportunity. Contrary to his guidance, the analyst suggested that BTC had much more fuel left before transitioning into a bear market. He envisioned a pump to as high as $200,000 in the following months as the asset prepares to enter a “distribution phase.” Other popular industry participants who touched upon the matter recently include Rekt Capital and KALEO. The former argued that BTC’s bull market progress has been 86% completed, meaning the potential point of exhaustion is not far away. The latter was more optimistic, simply claiming that a target of over $200,000 is “a magnet.” Observing Some Essential Indicators There are numerous factors suggesting that the asset has much more room for growth in the short term. Let’s focus on the inflows into spot BTC ETFs, for instance. Data compiled from SoSoValue shows that over the past several days, more capital has entered these funds than exited, indicating growing investor confidence. The total netflow for May 22 alone stands at over $934 million, whereas the last day when the netflow dropped below zero was on May 13. We move on to the exchange netflows, which have been predominantly negative in the last month. This signals a shifting trend from centralized platforms toward self-custody methods, which could be viewed as a bullish element since it reduces the immediate selling pressure. BTC Exchange Netflow, Source: CryptoQuant Additionally, CryptoQuant analysts examined the Spot Taker Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) over a 90-day window to estimate that taker buy orders have once again outpaced sell orders. This indicator measures the balance between aggressive buyers and sellers, and its recent shift indicates that buying pressure is starting to build again. However, it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. Earlier today, the popular BTC Fear and Greed Index soared to “Extreme Greed” territory for the first time since January. The metric analyzes various factors, including price swings, social media activity, and survey responses, to gauge the current investor sentiment toward the leading cryptocurrency. BTC Fear and Greed, Source: alternative.me While the mostly optimistic mood may seem promising, it’s important to remember that the crypto market is highly unpredictable, and prices often move in the opposite direction of what most expect. People should also keep in mind Warren Buffett’s famous advice, who once said they should “be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful. “ The post ‘Legendary Gains or Legendary Regrets:’ Crucial Guidance to Investors After Bitcoin’s New ATH appeared first on CryptoPotato .",cryptopotato,https://cryptopotato.com/legendary-gains-or-legendary-regrets-crucial-guidance-to-investors-after-bitcoins-new-ath/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price",cryptocompare
2025-05-23T15:04:27.000Z,"XRP Just Entered the Danger Zone — Here’s What Traders Are Watching Closely (XRP Price Prediction)","The XRP price has risen slightly in the past 24 hours, with its move to $2.44 coming as the crypto market as a whole posts a 1.5% loss today. This puts XRP up by 1% in a week and by 7% in the last 30 days, with the alt also boasting a 360% increase in the past year. However, as positive as things have been for XRP in recent weeks, its chart has begun moving towards an increasingly overbought position, suggesting that a short-term correction could be coming. This won’t change its long-term price prediction though, with XRP remaining arguably one of the fundamentally strongest tokens in the market. XRP Just Entered the Danger Zone — Here’s What Traders Are Watching Closely (XRP Price Prediction) XRP has been on an upward curve since the middle of April, and it’s arguable that it’s now nearing a point where it may consolidate or dip a little. Probably the most significant detail is that the coin’s 30-day average (orange) has been well above the 200-day (blue) since early November, suggesting that a comedown is now overdue. Source: TradingView On the other hand, its relative strength index (purple) isn’t quite as clearcut, given that it had been below 50 since early February. And it has been above 60 for only a week or so, so it would suggest that XRP still has time to post more gains before it enters a decidedly overbought position. Indeed, if we look at the latest CoinShares Digital Asset Fund Flows report , we see that XRP funds attracted $5 million in new volume in the week to May 19. This puts XRP fourth (behind Solana, Ethereum and Bitcoin) in terms of total assets under management, with digital funds now holding a total of $1.42 billion in the token. In fact, the past couple of days have seen some major XRP whale moves, with one investor taking $567 million in XRP off Kraken on May 21. 236,982,972 #XRP (567,278,563 USD) transferred from #Kraken to unknown wallet https://t.co/p6ZdeUCnGj — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) May 21, 2025 Demand for XRP is therefore still strong, and with the market still waiting on ten applications for spot-based XRP ETFs in the US, we could see massive moves for the coin later in the year. Based on this, we could see the XRP reach $3 by the end of the summer, and $4 by the end of the year. New Altcoins with Strong Bull Cases As strong as XRP remains, it won’t be the only coin to perform well over the summer, as the crypto market continues the recovery from its Q1 lull. There will also be various new coins that do well in the coming months, with new alts often outpacing the market during their initial phases of discovery. This is also likely to include a handful of the best presale tokens, which generate big momentum during their sales and then rally once they list. One coin likely to do this is Bitcoin Bull (BTCBULL) , which has now raised $6.2 million in its ICO. Bitcoin hit $111K. The first BTCBULL burn milestone is getting closer. pic.twitter.com/1iHi376vQl — BTCBULL_TOKEN (@BTCBULL_TOKEN) May 22, 2025 What’s interesting about Bitcoin Bull is that it’s a deflationary token, with a hard cap of 21 billion BTCBULL. Not only that, but it’s tied its tokenomics to the performance of Bitcoin (BTC), with the coin burning a percentage of its total supply whenever BTC reaches a new $25,000 milestone. It will also hold Bitcoin airdrops when BTC reaches new $50,000 milestones, beginning with $150,000. This could make BTCBULL a very profitable coin to hold, particularly when, as an Ethereum-based token, holders will be able to stake it for passive income. To join its presale, you can go to the Bitcoin Bull website and connect a compatible wallet, such as Best Wallet. BTCBULL currently costs $0.002525, but this will rise again tomorrow, and will continue to rise until the sale ends.

2025-05-23T15:00:24.000Z,"Bitcoin Treasury: Smarter Web Company Makes Strategic BTC Addition","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Treasury: Smarter Web Company Makes Strategic BTC Addition In a move highlighting the increasing interest in digital assets among publicly listed companies, UK-based Smarter Web Company has announced a significant boost to its Bitcoin treasury . This decision underscores a growing trend of corporations exploring cryptocurrencies as part of their broader financial strategy. Smarter Web Company Strengthens BTC Holdings Smarter Web Company, a firm listed in the UK, recently shared via its official X (formerly Twitter) account that it has added a substantial amount of Bitcoin to its corporate reserves. The announcement detailed the acquisition of 23.09 BTC. The company reported an average purchase price of $107,424 for this latest tranche. This acquisition significantly increases the company’s overall BTC holdings . Following this addition, Smarter Web Company’s total Bitcoin treasury now stands at 58.71 BTC. This represents a notable accumulation of the leading cryptocurrency on their balance sheet. Why Are Companies Pursuing Corporate Bitcoin Adoption? Smarter Web Company isn’t alone in this strategy. A growing number of corporations worldwide are considering or actively pursuing Corporate Bitcoin adoption . Several factors drive this trend: Inflation Hedge: Many companies view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation, believing its fixed supply makes it a better store of value over the long term compared to traditional fiat currencies, which can be devalued through printing. Balance Sheet Diversification: Adding Bitcoin provides diversification away from purely holding cash or traditional low-yield assets, potentially offering exposure to a high-growth, uncorrelated asset class. Store of Value: Proponents argue Bitcoin serves as a digital gold, a robust store of value in an increasingly digital global economy. Leading Edge & Innovation: For some, holding Bitcoin signals an embrace of technological innovation and forward-thinking financial strategies. Investor Demand: Increasing investor interest in companies with exposure to digital assets can also be a factor. While the average purchase price of $107,424 might seem high compared to historical Bitcoin prices, it reflects the market conditions at the time of acquisition and the company’s conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. The Significance of Institutional Bitcoin Investment The move by Smarter Web Company is another data point in the broader narrative of Institutional Bitcoin investment . When publicly traded companies allocate capital to Bitcoin, it lends credibility to the asset class and can encourage further institutional interest. This trend started gaining significant traction with major players like MicroStrategy and Tesla making large Bitcoin purchases. While Smarter Web Company’s holdings are smaller in comparison, each new corporate adoption reinforces the idea that Bitcoin is maturing as an asset suitable for treasury management. However, it’s important to acknowledge the challenges. Holding Bitcoin exposes a company’s balance sheet to significant price volatility. The value of their BTC holdings can fluctuate dramatically, impacting reported earnings and requiring careful accounting and risk management. What Does This Mean for the Future of Corporate Treasuries? The decision by Smarter Web Company to increase its Bitcoin treasury prompts questions about the future of corporate finance. Will more companies follow suit? What are the potential benefits and risks? Potential Benefits: Potential appreciation of treasury assets. Diversification away from traditional risks. Attracting investors interested in digital assets. Potential Challenges: High price volatility. Regulatory uncertainty. Custody and security risks. Accounting and tax complexities. Companies considering Corporate Bitcoin adoption must weigh these factors carefully. It requires a deep understanding of the asset, a long-term perspective, and robust risk management frameworks. Actionable Insight for the Curious For individuals or businesses observing this trend, the key takeaway is that Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed through a strategic lens by sophisticated financial actors. While individual investment decisions differ from corporate treasury management, understanding the drivers behind Institutional Bitcoin investment can provide valuable context for evaluating the asset. The continued accumulation of BTC holdings by companies like Smarter Web Company suggests a belief in Bitcoin’s potential as a long-term store of value, despite its short-term price swings. Conclusion: Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Continues Smarter Web Company’s latest purchase is a clear signal of its commitment to holding Bitcoin as a treasury asset. Adding 23.09 BTC brings their total to 58.71 BTC, reinforcing the growing trend of Corporate Bitcoin adoption . This move highlights the perceived benefits of Bitcoin as a potential inflation hedge and diversification tool, even as companies navigate the inherent volatility and challenges associated with digital assets. As more companies like Smarter Web Company make strategic moves into the space, the landscape of corporate finance continues to evolve, driven by the increasing significance of Institutional Bitcoin investment .

2025-05-23T15:00:00.000Z,"From Wall Street to Block Street? Trump’s 50% Tariff Threat Sparks Risk-Off Rotations Into Crypto Assets","Wall Street was jolted this morning as President Donald Trump announced a 50% tariff on all goods imported from the European Union , effective June 1. Stocks across Europe and U.S. futures plunged instantly, with the Dow projected to open 600 points down — and traders scrambling for cover. But as the fear index rises, crypto is catching a bid . Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and a wave of altcoins are climbing in what many are now calling a “risk-off rotation” from traditional markets to decentralized assets. Wall Street Rattled by Trade War Revival Trump’s declaration, posted on Truth Social, blasted the EU for “unjust trade practices” and blamed the bloc for America’s $250 billion trade deficit. This policy whiplash — coming just minutes after threatening a 25% tariff on Apple products — stunned global markets and sent equities into a tailspin . This sudden spike in geopolitical and trade risk is prompting many investors to ask: where is capital going to hide next? Crypto: The Surprise Winner? Crypto markets appear to be offering the answer. Bitcoin (BTC) is holding above $108K with minor gains, showing strength amidst the equities selloff. Ethereum (ETH) rose over 4%, possibly benefiting from its positioning as programmable money in uncertain economic times. MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGAFINANCE) exploded 16% in 24 hours, with sentiment surging on political meme alignment. Pepe and Sui also posted outsized gains, signaling a renewed appetite for altcoins. This rotation comes as stablecoin volumes rise and on-chain accumulation patterns re-emerge , hinting that institutional and high-net-worth investors may be quietly repositioning for volatility. Analysts: The Shift Is Real Market strategists are calling this an early signal that “Block Street” may be absorbing capital from Wall Street : “When you see defensive altcoins and meme tokens moving on macro news, it’s not just retail — it’s rotation,” said one crypto fund manager. Others note that MAGACOIN FINANCE may be uniquely positioned to benefit from the Trump narrative, election season buzz, and the exact kind of anti-establishment energy that fuels risk asset surges in turbulent environments. Will Bitcoin sustain support above $108K amid worsening U.S.–EU tensions? Can XRP continue its climb as a cross-border alternative with institutional backing? Is MAGACOIN FINANCE the surprise political play of 2025? Will more U.S. tech firms face tariff threats — and push capital into decentralized sectors? Bottom Line: Trump’s tariff threats may be bruising Wall Street, but they’re igniting Block Street . In this environment, crypto is not just surviving — it’s thriving. As traditional markets falter, the smart money may already be rotating. The only question is: are you on the right side of the shift?

2025-05-23T15:00:00.000Z,"Spoiler alert: The future of Web3 is not blockchain","Opinion by: Grigore Roșu, founder and chief executive officer of Pi Squared For some, the audacity of questioning the primacy of blockchain in Web3 is borderline heretical. The idea that decentralization and progress could exist without blockchains seems absurd to those who built careers around Bitcoin, Ethereum, and their descendants. Given blockchain's well-documented scaling limits, however, there is an argument to be made that Web3 doesn't actually need blockchains to thrive. Instead, it requires payment systems and verifiable settlement systems that are super fast. Blockchains are just one way to achieve that, not the only way. While blockchain solved the double-spending problem, it introduced its own architectural burden: the rigid fixation on total ordering, dictating that every transaction must wait its turn in a global queue, processed through a monolithic consensus mechanism. Initially, this made sense in the context of payments, where security and simplicity were paramount. Still, in the context of Web3, where complex applications require speed, flexibility, and scale, this same mechanism has become a constraint. It imposes a kind of serialized tyranny, throttling throughput and locking developers into a narrow lane of design options. The undeniable influence of FastPay Mobile remittance app FastPay proved that double-spending can be avoided differently without a total order. This inspired systems like Linera , which use independent local orderings while maintaining global verifiability, proving that a different, more scalable future is possible and already underway. FastPay also inspired the likes of POD and Sui's single-owner objects protocol. If FastPay had been invented before Bitcoin, blockchain might never have captured the cultural or technical imagination in the way that it did. Recent: Beijing to invest in blockchain, integrate into infrastructure Some will no doubt argue that total ordering is essential for financial integrity or that without blockchains, decentralization itself unravels. These concerns, however, mistake a particular implementation of trustlessness for trustlessness itself. What truly underpins decentralized systems is the verifiability of a transaction, not the precise order in which it happened relative to every other global transaction. Blockchain's growing pains are still on display While Ethereum's Dencun upgrade sought to improve transaction throughput through \""blobs,\"" the core architecture remains tied to total ordering. Even with Solana's introduction of the Lattice system, the network continues to suffer outages caused by bugs and excessive load. Additionally, the explosion of L2s is more a workaround than a solution, offloading transactions from mainnets only to reintroduce them later in delayed batches, resulting in an endless cycle of what is essentially congestion management. The rise of flexible payment and settlement protocols Like in legacy tech circles, the “evolve or die” mantra certainly applies to investors and builders anchored to traditional blockchain architectures. Moving forward, protocols prioritizing flexible, verifiable payment systems and settlement over rigid total ordering will unlock far greater throughput and better user experiences. As decentralized applications evolve and autonomous agents driven by AI begin interacting with blockchains, the cost of sequencing everything in order will become a competitive liability. There have already been signs of this tectonic shift taking place, with the growing adoption of modular blockchain frameworks like Celestia underscoring a broader recognition that classical blockchains are too inflexible. Data availability layers, execution shards and offchain verification mechanisms are all attempts to decouple blockchain's trusted validation from its limiting sequencing model. While these efforts may not break entirely from the past, they point unmistakably toward a future of more adaptable infrastructure. A new role for blockchain This doesn't mean blockchain will disappear, but it must evolve. Looking ahead, its most enduring role may be as a universal verifier, less a master ledger and more of a decentralized notary within a broader, more agile stack. While this is a necessary evolution, unfortunately, it's hard to see how that shift will be smooth, as too much capital, ideology and career risk is tied up in the legacy narrative. Many venture funds, DeFi protocols, and \""Ethereum killers\"" are financially and reputationally invested in keeping the blockchain central. But history has little mercy for technological incumbents that cling to yesterday's model.

Bitcoin dominance resurges as XRP rallies strongly; meanwhile, Unilabs achieves a major milestone in the crypto market. Table of Contents BTC price analysis: Open interest continues Bitcoin dominance Unilabs presale hits jackpot: Crosses $800,000 in stage 2 XRP price rally to $3 at risk? Ripple whales drop holdings Unilabs outperforms Ripple with AI blockchain finance Conclusion According to a senior analyst, BTC has reclaimed its VIP status after closing near its ATH and resuming the ‘Bitcoin dominance’ over other crypto projects. However, the surging XRP price rally hints that Ripple could show a decent debut this cycle. Meanwhile, Unilabs (UNIL) surprises token holders with a marvelous move, raising $800,000 in 2 weeks of going live.

BTC price analysis: Open interest continues Bitcoin dominance Bitcoin (BTC) price has stabilized above $109,000 today, which is just a few inches away from its all-time high of $109,588 from January 20. BTC’s Open Interest (OI) has surged to a new record high of $75.14 billion, maintaining the Bitcoin dominance over other crypto networks. According to Coinglass, the futures’ OI in BTC has reached a new ATH of $75.14 today. Historically, when open interest reached a record high, BTC price generally soared to a new all-time high, as seen in previous bullish cycles. This bullish outlook is because an increasing OI represents Bitcoin dominance and additional money entering the market and new buying, which could fuel BTC to break its ATH of $109,588. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart reads 69, hovering around its overbought level of 70, indicating signs of bullish exhaustion. Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator lines are coiling together, suggesting indecisiveness among traders. The current technical factors suggest continued Bitcoin dominance in Q3 of this year. Unilabs presale hits jackpot: Crosses $800,000 in stage 2 While Bitcoin dominance leads secondary crypto projects in the trillion-dollar crypto market, Unilabs is turning heads with its next-generation DeFi asset management system. This investment protocol presents a sophisticated, technology-driven platform designed to address the typical complexities of the crypto market. Unilabs incorporates advanced AI with the transparent and secure architecture of blockchain finance to democratize access to institutional-grade investment analytics and portfolio management tools. The platform enables retail and institutional investors to maintain an edge over the DeFi ecosystem with enhanced accuracy and confidence. XRP price rally to $3 at risk? Ripple whales drop holdings The recent XRP price analysis showed it’s facing growing downside risks. As of today, Ripple (XRP) is trading at $2.33 amid suppressed price action in the last three days. The broad sideways trading reflects range consolidation in the broader cryptocurrency market, even as Bitcoin (BTC) closes in on all-time highs. As the XRP price broadly consolidates above the short-term support at $2.28, attention is shifting to the XRP Ledger, which is facing declining network activity. The Daily Active Addresses metric in the Ripple chart below shows newly created addresses on the protocol at approximately 33,400, representing a 95% drop from the first quarter peak of roughly 612,000. This sharp decline coincided with the drop in the XRP price from its first-quarter peak of $3.40 to $1.61 amid the tariff-triggered crash on April 7. While the Ripple price recovered, reaching $2.65 on May 12 before sliding to the current market rate of $2.33, engagement remains low based on the diminished number of unique addresses joining the Ripple network. Unilabs outperforms Ripple with AI blockchain finance Unilabs’ fast-growing DeFi network is alerting most Ripple holders as its successful presale debut makes headlines. So far, the platform has raised over $850,000 within two weeks of the presale announcement and sold over 160 million UNIL tokens priced at $0.005 right now. With the current momentum, Unilabs’ presale is poised to complete before the estimated time. As a reward-centric project, Unilabs incorporates a blockchain-based profit-sharing model to distribute the share of gains automatically. Its robust DeFi asset manager pours capital positions, staking yields, and arbitrage wins into one profit pool. Also, the platform is built on the highest security standards to ensure transactions are secure and transparent on the blockchain. Conclusion With the Bitcoin dominance continuation and the XRP price holding a strong position among Ripple investors, Unilabs is well-equipped to shift the spotlight from other networks to its AI-powered DeFi asset management system with over $30.8 million in AUM.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) dropped to $107,300, down by 4.12% from its highest point this week. Similarly, Ethereum ( ETH ) fell by over 8% from its weekly high, while the market cap of all cryptocurrencies, excluding Bitcoin, fell from this week’s high of $1.28 trillion to $1.19 trillion. The ongoing crypto crash coincided with the sell-off in the stock market. Futures tied to the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq 100 fell by over 1%, continuing a sell-off that has been going on since Monday.

In a TruthSocial post , President Donald Trump said that trade talks with the European Union were going nowhere, and warned that the US will apply a 50% tariff on all goods from the region. The statement meant an escalation at a time when market participants have been hoping for a deal between the two allies. Europe has hinted that it will respond by hiking tariffs on US goods, including Boeing jets. In a statement this week, Ryanair’s CEO warned it would consider cancelling a $33 billion order from Boeing and switching to Airbus if Boeing planes were hit with tariffs. Ryanair is Boeing’s biggest customer. These trade concerns are coming a week after Moody’s sent shockwaves in the financial market by downgrading the US credit rating . It also came as the House of Representatives voted for the Big Beautiful Bill that will increase US debt by over $3.8 trillion in a decade. Is this the end of the crypto bull run? This is not the end of the crypto market bull run for three main reasons. First, the 50% tariff on European goods is a negotiating tactic as Trump did with China. After pushing tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%, he pared them back to 30% earlier this month. Second, Bitcoin has become a safe haven asset . Most recently, it outperformed the stock market after the Liberation Day tariffs. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have added over $8 billion in inflows since April. Bitcoin’s appeal as a safe-haven asset is mostly because of its demand and supply metrics. Demand from institutions continues to rise as supply on exchanges and over-the-counter venues continues to fall. Also, Bitcoin has proven itself as a worthy asset in the last 16 years as it jumped from near zero to $111,900 this week. Third, these pullbacks in Bitcoin and altcoins are normal. Just recently, Bitcoin fell from $109,300 in January to $75,000 in April and then bounced back to a record high. In 2024, it peaked at $73,340 in March, fell to $49,390 in August, and rebounded to a record high in November.

If Ethereum’s network activity and total value locked continue to grow, ETH price may see further gains. Ether’s price printed a “bull flag” on the daily chart, a technical chart formation associated with strong upward momentum. Could a strengthening technical setup and increasing transaction fees signal the continuation of ETH’s rally toward $4,000? Ethereum transaction fees rising is bullish Marketwide recovery, fueled by Bitcoin’s rise to new all-time highs and improving macroeconomic conditions, saw Ether’s ( ETH ) price rise by nearly 56% to an eight-week high of $2,734 on May 23, from a low of $1,750 on May 6. This strength in price is reflected in onchain activity, with Ethereum’s daily transaction count rising by 37% over the last 30 days. These levels were last seen in January 2024, when the hype around the approval of US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs pushed ETH price above $4,000 for the first time since December 2021.

Related: Ethereum holders back in profit as ETH price enters 'crucial area' for $3K breakout Historically, Ether’s price has surged during high-usage periods. For example, during the 2021 DeFi boom, fees spiked to as high as 0.015 ETH due to high demand. As such, high utilization periods with high fees indicate growth in network activity or bullish sentiment, as more ETH is needed for gas, pushing its price upward. Increasing TVL supports ETH price bulls The increase in Ethereum’s network activity is also evident when analyzing the total value locked (TVL) on the network’s smart contracts.

2025-05-23T15:00:00.000Z,"Spoiler alert: The future of Web3 is not blockchain","Opinion by: Grigore Roșu, founder and chief executive officer of Pi SquaredFor some, the audacity of questioning the primacy of blockchain in Web3 is borderline heretical. The idea that decentralization and progress could exist without blockchains seems absurd to those who built careers around Bitcoin, Ethereum, and their descendants. Given blockchain's well-documented scaling limits, however, there is an argument to be made that Web3 doesn't actually need blockchains to thrive. Instead, it requires payment systems and verifiable settlement systems that are super fast. Blockchains are just one way to achieve that, not the only way.While blockchain solved the double-spending problem, it introduced its own architectural burden: the rigid fixation on total ordering, dictating that every transaction must wait its turn in a global queue, processed through a monolithic consensus mechanism. Initially, this made sense in the context of payments, where security and simplicity were paramount. Still, in the context of Web3, where complex applications require speed, flexibility, and scale, this same mechanism has become a constraint. It imposes a kind of serialized tyranny, throttling throughput and locking developers into a narrow lane of design options. The undeniable influence of FastPayMobile remittance app FastPay proved that double-spending can be avoided differently without a total order. This inspired systems like Linera, which use independent local orderings while maintaining global verifiability, proving that a different, more scalable future is possible and already underway. FastPay also inspired the likes of POD and Sui's single-owner objects protocol. If FastPay had been invented before Bitcoin, blockchain might never have captured the cultural or technical imagination in the way that it did.Recent: Beijing to invest in blockchain, integrate into infrastructureSome will no doubt argue that total ordering is essential for financial integrity or that without blockchains, decentralization itself unravels. These concerns, however, mistake a particular implementation of trustlessness for trustlessness itself. What truly underpins decentralized systems is the verifiability of a transaction, not the precise order in which it happened relative to every other global transaction. Blockchain's growing pains are still on displayWhile Ethereum's Dencun upgrade sought to improve transaction throughput through \""blobs,\"" the core architecture remains tied to total ordering. Even with Solana's introduction of the Lattice system, the network continues to suffer outages caused by bugs and excessive load. Additionally, the explosion of L2s is more a workaround than a solution, offloading transactions from mainnets only to reintroduce them later in delayed batches, resulting in an endless cycle of what is essentially congestion management.The rise of flexible payment and settlement protocolsLike in legacy tech circles, the “evolve or die” mantra certainly applies to investors and builders anchored to traditional blockchain architectures. Moving forward, protocols prioritizing flexible, verifiable payment systems and settlement over rigid total ordering will unlock far greater throughput and better user experiences. As decentralized applications evolve and autonomous agents driven by AI begin interacting with blockchains, the cost of sequencing everything in order will become a competitive liability.There have already been signs of this tectonic shift taking place, with the growing adoption of modular blockchain frameworks like Celestia underscoring a broader recognition that classical blockchains are too inflexible. Data availability layers, execution shards and offchain verification mechanisms are all attempts to decouple blockchain's trusted validation from its limiting sequencing model. While these efforts may not break entirely from the past, they point unmistakably toward a future of more adaptable infrastructure.A new role for blockchainThis doesn't mean blockchain will disappear, but it must evolve. Looking ahead, its most enduring role may be as a universal verifier, less a master ledger and more of a decentralized notary within a broader, more agile stack. While this is a necessary evolution, unfortunately, it's hard to see how that shift will be smooth, as too much capital, ideology and career risk is tied up in the legacy narrative. Many venture funds, DeFi protocols, and \""Ethereum killers\"" are financially and reputationally invested in keeping the blockchain central. But history has little mercy for technological incumbents that cling to yesterday's model. Just as the internet outgrew its early walled gardens, Web3 is poised to move beyond the rigidity of block-based sequencing. The fruits from the next wave of infrastructure will belong to those who understand and capitalize on this inflection point. Opinion by: Grigore Roșu, founder and chief executive officer of Pi Squared.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Here are just a few:Justin SunTron founder Justin Sun was the largest TRUMP tokenholder at the gala, which was reportedly enough to earn him a special watch, presented in a special ceremony. Sun was awarded a watch in a ceremony at the event. Source: Justin SunSun’s presence at the event was particularly controversial. Last year, he faced a lawsuit brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission over the alleged “orchestration of the unregistered offer and sale, manipulative trading, and unlawful touting of crypto asset securities.”The SEC asked for a reprieve in late February, just over a month since Trump’s inauguration and the subsequent 180 in federal agencies’ approach toward regulating crypto. Outside the crypto dinner, Sun posted on May 21 that he would be spending a week in Washington, DC to have “meaningful conversations that will help shape the next chapter of blockchain’s future” in the United States.Kain WarwickKain Warwick, founder of crypto exchange operator iFinex, told The New York Times on May 12 that he was attending the event after stocking up on enough TRUMP to break the top 25 investors on the leaderboard. Warwick said he wanted to have a shot at meeting the president, or someone on his team, to talk crypto — specifically decentralized finance (DeFi), which is getting less attention in the current crop of crypto bills circulating the US Congress.“If you assume Trump and 10 people within the Trump team are there, now you’ve got a one in 15 shot of having a conversation with one of them,” he said.Vincent LiuVincent Liu, chief investment officer of crypto trading, VC and market-making firm Kronos Research, attended the event, posting pictures of the menu and Trump’s brief speech.A photo of the menu at Donald Trump’s memecoin dinner.

Odom himself will hold 5% of all ODOM.Sangrok OhCEO of Seoul- and Tokyo-based cryptocurrency management firm Hyperithm, Sangrok Oh was the 13th-largest TRUMP holder with a wallet containing over $3 million worth of the token, according to the Straits Times. Oh told The New York Times that he had arrived with a batch of red “Make Crypto Great Again” hats to give away at the dinner and expected to speak directly with the president. “It’s kind of a fund-raiser [...] And he’ll always be good to his sponsors.”Oh has been critical of the slow regulatory progress for crypto in the countries where his company operates. Anonymous attendeesIn addition to crypto execs and sports stars, the event also noted a few anonymous or pseudonymous crypto traders and entrepreneurs in attendance. Among them was “Ice,” co-founder of the Singaporean crypto company MemeCore. Their company’s chief business development officer, Cherry Hsu, told Sherwood News that Trump’s rise “represents the power of memes to influence culture, perception, and movements — principles that align with MemeCore’s vision of a decentralized, community-driven future.”“Ogle,” a cybersecurity adviser to Trump’s own World Liberty Financial crypto enterprise, as well as the pseudonymous co-founder of blockchain ecosystem Glue, also attended. Ogle said they were going out of curiosity, more than anything, and did not endorse Trump personally. “I’m hoping it’ll be fun — and hoping they’ll serve McDonald’s.”Another anonymous attendee was “Cryptoo Bear,” a crypto trader and occasional news reporter who posts primarily in Japanese. Cryptoo Bear made no political statements about the event, mainly posting about the swag and the food.

Critics of the event widely consider it to be a glaring example of corruption in Washington and within the Trump administration. Senator Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, joined the protest. “The spirit of the Constitution was that no one elected would be selling influence to anyone,” he said, “because it’s to be government by and for the people.”Ken Papaj, a former Treasury Department official, said, “Every time there’s a transaction, he gets a transaction fee? Just unconscionable what he’s doing.”The dinner comes at a pivotal time for the crypto industry in the US, where the industry is pushing hard for Congress to pass friendly regulations.

2025-05-23T14:20:00.000Z,"What is DNS hijacking? How it took down Curve Finance’s website","Understanding the Curve Finance DNS hijacking              On May 12, 2025, at 20:55 UTC, hackers hijacked the “.fi” domain name system (DNS) of Curve Finance after managing to access the registrar. They began sending its users to a malicious website, attempting to drain their wallets. This was the second attack on Curve Finance’s infrastructure in a week.Users were directed to a website that was a non-functional decoy, designed only to trick users into providing wallet signatures. The hack hadn’t breached the protocol’s smart contracts and was limited to the DNS layer.The DNS is a critical component of the internet that functions like a phonebook. It allows you to use simple, memorable domain names (such as facebook.com) instead of complex numerical IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1) for websites. DNS converts these user-friendly domain names into the IP addresses computers require to connect.This is not the first time Curve Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, has suffered such an attack. Back in August 2022, Curve Finance faced an attack with similar tactics. The attackers had cloned the Curve Finance website and interfered with its DNS settings to send users to a duplicate version of the website. Users who tried using the platform ended up losing their money to the attackers. The project was using the same registrar, “iwantmyname,” at the time of the previous attack.                  How attackers execute DNS hijacking in crypto              When a user types a web address, their device queries a DNS server to retrieve the corresponding IP address and connect to the correct website. In DNS hijacking, fraudsters interfere with this process by altering how DNS queries are resolved, rerouting users to malicious sites without their knowledge.Fraudsters execute DNS hijacking in several ways. Attackers might exploit vulnerabilities in DNS servers, compromise routers, or gain access to domain registrar accounts. The objective is to change the DNS records so that a user trying to visit a legitimate site is redirected to a fake, lookalike page containing wallet-draining code. Types of DNS hijacking include:Local DNS hijack: Malware on a user’s device changes DNS settings, redirecting traffic locally. Router hijack: Attackers compromise home or office routers to alter DNS for all connected devices. Man-in-the-middle attack: Intercepts DNS queries between user and server, altering responses on the fly. Registrar-level hijack: Attackers gain access to a domain registrar account and modify official DNS records, affecting all users globally.Did you know? During the Curve Finance DNS attack in 2023, users accessing the real domain unknowingly signed malicious transactions. The back end was untouched, but millions were lost through a spoofed front end.                  How DNS hijacking worked in the case of Curve Finance              When attackers compromise a website with DNS hijacking, they can reroute traffic to a malicious website without the user’s knowledge. There are several ways DNS hijacking can occur. Attackers might infect a user’s device with malware that alters local DNS settings, or they may gain control of a router and change its DNS configuration. They may also target DNS servers or domain registrars themselves. In such cases, they modify the DNS records at the source, affecting all users trying to access the site.In the case of Curve Finance, the attackers infiltrated the systems of the domain registrar “iwantmyname” and altered the DNS delegation of the “curve.fi” domain to redirect traffic to their own DNS server. A domain registrar is a company authorized to manage the reservation and registration of internet domain names. It allows individuals or organizations to claim ownership of a domain and link it to web services like hosting and email.The precise method of the breach is still under investigation. By May 22, 2025, no evidence of unauthorized access or compromised credentials was found.Did you know? DNS hijacking attacks often succeed by compromising domain registrar accounts through phishing or poor security. Many Web3 projects still host domains with centralized providers like GoDaddy or Namecheap.                   How Curve Finance responded to the hack              While the registrar was slow to respond, the Curve team took measures to deal with the situation. It successfully redirected the “.fi” domain to neutral nameservers, thus taking the website offline while efforts to regain control continued. To ensure safe access to the frontend and secure fund management, the Curve team quickly launched a secure alternative at “curve.finance,” now serving as the official Curve Finance interface temporarily.Upon discovering the exploit at 21:20 UTC, the following actions were taken: Users were immediately notified through official channelsRequested the takedown of the compromised domainInitiated mitigation and domain recovery processesCollaborated with security partners and the registrar to coordinate a response.Compromise of the domain notwithstanding, the Curve protocol and its smart contracts remained secure and fully operational. During the disruption of the front end, Curve processed over $400 million in onchain volume. No user data was at risk, as Curve’s front end does not store any user information.Throughout the compromise, the Curve team was always available through its Discord server, where users could raise issues with them.After implementing immediate damage control measures, the Curve team is now taking additional steps to prepare for the future.Assessing and enhancing registrar-level security, incorporating stronger protections and exploring alternative registrarsInvestigating decentralized front-end options to eliminate dependence on susceptible web infrastructurePartnering with the broader DeFi and Ethereum Name Service (ENS) communities to advocate for native browser support for “.eth” domains.Did you know? Unlike smart contract exploits, DNS hijacks leave no trace onchain initially, making it hard for users to realize they have been tricked until funds are gone. It is a stealthy form of crypto theft.                  How crypto projects can deal with DNS hijacking vulnerability              The Curve Finance attack is concerning because it bypassed the decentralized security mechanisms at the protocol level. Curve’s backend, meaning its smart contracts and onchain logic, remained unharmed, yet users lost funds because they were deceived at the interface level. This incident underscores a significant vulnerability in DeFi. While the backend may be decentralized and trustless, the front end still depends on centralized Web2 infrastructure like DNS, hosting and domain registrars. Attackers can exploit these centralized choke points to undermine trust and steal funds. The Curve attack serves as a wake-up call for the crypto industry to explore decentralized web infrastructure, such as InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Ethereum Name Service (ENS), to reduce reliance on vulnerable centralized services.To address the gap between decentralized backends and centralized frontends, crypto projects must adopt a multi-layered approach. Here are various ways crypto projects can deal with this gap:Minimize reliance on traditional DNS: They can minimize reliance on traditional DNS by integrating decentralized alternatives of DNS like the ENS or Handshake, which reduce the risk of registrar-level hijacks. Use decentralized file storage systems: Hosting frontends on decentralized file storage systems such as IPFS or Arweave adds another layer of protection.Implement domain name system security extensions (DNSSEC): Teams should implement DNSSEC to verify the integrity of DNS records and prevent unauthorized changes. Secure registrar accounts: Registrar accounts must be secured with strong authentication methods, including multifactor authentication (MFA) and domain locking. Train users: Educating users to verify site authenticity, such as bookmarking URLs or checking ENS records, can reduce phishing success rates. Bridging the trust gap between decentralized protocols and centralized interfaces is essential for maintaining security and user confidence in DeFi platforms.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-dns-hijacking-how-it-took-down-curve-finances-website?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Cetus’ recovery plan on Sui mirrors a Solana blueprint","The bounty offer to recover stolen funds from Sui-based decentralized exchange (DEX) Cetus closely resembles a successful strategy used by a Solana project three years ago.It turns out that Cetus shares the same development team as Crema Finance, a Solana-based DeFi project that suffered a $9-million hack in 2022 but recovered most of the funds by negotiating with its hacker. Now, Cetus is relying on the same strategy.Cetus is asking the hacker to return all but $6 million, or 2,324 Ether (ETH), of the stolen funds in exchange for a promise not to pursue legal action. The protocol lost $223 million to an exploit on May 22.The size of the bounty has sparked backlash from users, with many calling for a formal compensation plan instead. Several community members argue that even if funds are recovered, most of the damage has already been done — especially to holders of the CETUS token, which plummeted in value following the incident.Meanwhile, Sui validators are also under fire for their role in freezing the funds. The move is aimed at aiding recovery, yet critics say it exposes centralization risks in the network.CETUS immediately dropped around 35% following the hack.

Around $63 million had already been bridged to Ethereum before these controls were implemented.Although the coordinated effort has been effective in preventing the funds from being laundered, the cryptocurrency community has criticized Sui for being too centralized.“SUI’s validators are colluding to CENSOR the hacker’s TXs right now! Does that make SUI centralized? The short answer is YES; what matters more is why?

Source: Squatch/Justin BonsAs Bons pointed out, Sui has just 114 validators — far fewer than its more established smart contract peers. Ethereum has over 1 million validators, while Solana has 1,157.Meanwhile, members of the Sui community defended the move, arguing that this is how real-world decentralized chains should function.“Decentralization isn’t about standing by while people get hurt, it’s about the power to act together, without needing permission,” said one member of the Sui community.Related: WLFI’s DeFi credentials under fire after Sui partnershipFollowing the hack, Sui developers committed code for a proposed function that would have allowed specific transactions to bypass all signing and safety checks by adding them to a whitelist. While the function could have been used to help recover stolen funds, it also raised concerns about centralized control and the erosion of decentralization. The code was ultimately not merged and is not live on the network.SUI’s price has also been damaged by the Cetus exploit. Source: CoinGeckoSui and Cetus backlash contrasts recent hacksThe Cetus exploit has spotlighted the persistent security challenges in DeFi while raising deeper questions around who holds the reins in supposedly decentralized networks like Sui.The team’s $6-million offer to the hacker mirrors the playbook it used with Crema — but this time, the crypto community isn’t as forgiving. With CETUS tanking, trust fractured and validators freezing funds, critics are asking whether Sui’s decentralization is more appearance than reality.The debate over decentralization isn’t unique to Sui. When Bybit lost $1.4 billion in a February hack linked to North Korean state actors, security experts and users urged platforms like THORChain and eXch to block the funds. In that case, THORChain received some backlash for not stepping in, which is the exact opposite of what Sui is being criticized for now.As of now, the hacker hasn’t accepted Cetus’ offer.

Meanwhile, across the Capitol, Representative Tom Emmer reintroduced the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, backed by bipartisan support.Breaking down GENIUSThe GENIUS Act — short for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act” — seeks to answer foundational questions around stablecoin issuance and oversight.“It defines this idea of a payment stablecoin,” explained Rashan Colbert, director of US policy at the Crypto Council for Innovation, in this week’s interview. Colbert emphasized that the bill doesn’t stop at definitions. “It outlines in a robust way just who’s allowed to do this and what they need to look like.” By this, he’s referring to guidelines on who can be permitted issuers like bank subsidiaries, credit unions and approved non-bank entities.Related: Interest groups, lawmakers to protest Trump’s memecoin dinnerThis bipartisan momentum seen backing the GENIUS Act is both exciting and significant. “There has been latent support within Congress, including within the Democratic caucus,” Colbert said. “They just haven’t had the opportunity to take meaningful votes.”Blockchain dev protectionOn the House side, the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, co-sponsored by Representatives Emmer and Ritchie Torres, aims to give legal clarity to developers and service providers who don’t custody customer funds.“It clarifies that they are not money transmitters,” said Colbert. “That’s the clarity these builders and entrepreneurs need to continue operating successfully.”With crypto adoption on the rise — particularly among minority communities — Colbert said the pressure is on. “Something like one in five Americans hold crypto. That number is even larger in the Black, Latino and Asian-American communities,” he noted.Looking ahead, the push toward broader market structure reform will be more complex. Colbert’s advice?

Instead, Bitcoin collateral will remain under full custody by Ledn or one of its designated funding partners. “This means assets aren’t rehypothecated, reused, or loaned out to generate yield,” Ledn co-founder and CEO Adam Reeds told Cointelegraph. Reeds said the move brings the company back to its roots and aligns more closely with Bitcoin’s founding principles.“Bitcoin was created as a direct response to the risks of fractional reserve banking and unchecked use of client assets to generate interest,” said Reed, adding:“Traditional finance relies on constantly reusing client assets to create leverage and, ultimately, inflation. Bitcoiners instinctively reject that model. That’s why we’ve moved away from this approach entirely. Reed told Cointelegraph that the company is ending support for Ether (ETH) as “part of a broader strategic shift,” as Bitcoin represents over 99% of Ledn’s client activity. “Rather than fragmenting the platform to chase marginal volume, we’re going all-in on Bitcoin and simplifying our stack to reflect what our clients actually value,” said Reed.Founded in 2018, Ledn has emerged as one of the largest lenders in the digital asset space with a loan book value of $9.9 billion, according to Galaxy Research.

Trump’s sons — Eric and Donald Jr. —are involved in the management of the company.Zhao said the WSJ article portrayed him as acting as a “fixer” for the WLF team and its co-founder Zach Witkoff during foreign trips. The article suggested Zhao facilitated introductions and meetings for WLF leaders during foreign trips, including a visit to Pakistan that reportedly resulted in a memorandum of understanding with a local official.“I am not a fixer for anyone,” Zhao said, firmly denying that he connected Pakistani official “Mr. Saqib” with WLF or organized any engagements abroad. “They had known each other way back, whereas I only met with Mr. Saqib for the first time in Pakistan.” Source: Changpeng ZhaoWSJ reports on Steve and Zach WitkoffZhao’s response follows a WSJ investigation highlighting a complex string of diplomatic and business interests involving WLF. The report raised concerns about the blurred lines between public duties and private interests and focused on diplomatic and business dealings involving WLF co-founders Steve Witkoff and his son, Zach Witkoff. Steve Witkoff serves as the US Special Envoy to the Middle East under the Trump administration, while Zach Witkoff has been involved in securing a reported $2 billion crypto deal.The report raised questions about whether diplomatic efforts overlapped with private crypto ventures, and implied Zhao may have been attempting to curry favor with the Trump administrationOn May 6, Zhao confirmed that he is seeking a pardon from the Trump administration for his earlier money laundering conviction. The report also highlighted that WLFI, which raised over $600 million in token sales, does not disclose the names of all its investors aside from some publicly known ones like Tron founder Justin Sun, who attended Trump’s memecoin dinner on May 22. Trump hosted the dinner for the largest investors of his Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin. Sun, Magic Eden CEO Jack Lu and BitMart CEO Sheldon Xia were among attendees and shared photos of the event.Related: Binance scores legal win as UK court partially dismisses Bitcoin SV lawsuitZhao claims the WSJ report is an “attack” on crypto Zhao claimed the WSJ submitted a list of questions containing what he described as “wrong and negative assumptions.” He and his public relations team responded by pointing out several factual inaccuracies, he said, but concluded that the article was “built on a flawed narrative.”Zhao slammed the WSJ, calling it a “mouthpiece” for anti-crypto forces in the United States. He said the forces behind the publication want to hinder efforts to make the US a crypto capital. “They want to attack crypto, global crypto leaders and the pro-crypto administration,” CZ claimed, saying the article is part of a broader effort to stifle the industry’s growth in the US.This is not the first time Zhao has clapped back at the WSJ recently. In an April 11 report, the publication cited anonymous sources alleging that Zhao agreed to testify against Tron founder Justin Sun as he settled with US prosecutors. CZ dismissed the report, saying that people who become government witnesses don’t go to prison and are protected.

Despite the correction, there are mixed signals about whether the price rally is overheated or whether this is a healthy pullback. Bitcoin “still not overheated” — analystBitcoin is not showing any signs of being overheated despite reaching new all-time highs this week, with several analysts pointing to fundamentals suggesting Bitcoin could rise further.“Overheating indicators such as the funding rate and short-term capital inflow remain low compared to previous peaks, and profit-taking by short-term investors is limited,” said CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan in a May 22 Quicktake note. Crypto Dan pointed out that Bitcoin’s funding rate, an indicator of market overheating, shows an increase in long bets.

Online banks, he said, spend about $20 to $30. In contrast, DeFi requires almost nothing beyond a smartphone and internet access.“Onboarding to DeFi literally costs zero,” Bukov said. “You don’t need brick-and-mortar infrastructure or lengthy verification processes. Just connect and transact.” Bukov said that this gives DeFi an edge over traditional financial institutions in reaching the 1.4 billion unbanked people who remain excluded from traditional finance due to high onboarding expenses.1inch Network co-founder Anton Bukov at the Dutch Blockchain Week. Source: CointelegraphReaching 1.4 billion unbanked users“That’s why we have 1.4 billion people on the planet who are unbanked. No one’s going to invest those hundreds or tens of dollars into them because they will never return to them,” Bukov added. Unlike traditional finance, which has high barriers to entry, Bukov said DeFi allows the unbanked to become a part of the global economy and engage in real-life transactions using stablecoins like Tether’s USDt (USDT). With lower barriers to entry, DeFi becomes a tool for financial inclusion. Bukov said DeFi will continue to reach users who never had access to traditional banking as internet access expands globally. “You can just get a phone, access to the internet, and you can exchange your chicken for USDT,” Bukov said, highlighting how easily DeFi enables participation in the global economy. Related: Animoca’s Yat Siu says student loans can supercharge DeFi growthDeFi allows access to global liquidity Apart from financial inclusion, Bukov said that the real value of crypto lies in how it gives access to global liquidity. The 1inch co-founder said crypto is evolving into an independent economic zone, where hundreds of billions flow through decentralized protocols. “Crypto isn’t just about adopting stablecoins or building national digital currencies,” Bukov said. “It’s a growing global liquidity hub.”He said that this liquidity is dynamic and allows financial experimentation, yield strategies and cross-border capital movement. Bukov added that countries that align their regulations to enable easier access to this global liquidity can tap into economic opportunities and cooperation. “The more countries trade with each other, the more they succeed.

2025-05-23T08:25:00.000Z,"Why Tether refuses to comply with MiCA","Is Tether MiCA compliant?              The EU’s new Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation, better known as MiCA, is the first major attempt by a global economic power to create clear, region-wide rules for the crypto space, and stablecoins are a big focus.MiCA mandates best practices. If a stablecoin is going to be traded in the EU, its issuer has to follow some stringent rules:1. You need a licenseTo issue a stablecoin in Europe, you must become a fully authorized electronic money institution (EMI). That’s the same kind of license traditional fintechs need to offer e-wallets or prepaid cards. It’s not cheap and it’s not quick. 2. Most of your reserves have to sit in European banksThis is one of the most controversial parts of MiCA. If you issue a “significant” stablecoin — and Tether’s USDT certainly qualifies — at least 60% of your reserves must be held in EU-based banks. The logic is to keep the financial system safe. 3. Full transparency is non-negotiableMiCA requires detailed, regular disclosures. Issuers have to publish a white paper and provide updates on their reserves, audits and operational changes. This level of reporting is new territory for some stablecoins, especially those that have historically avoided public scrutiny.4. Non-compliant coins are getting delistedIf a token doesn’t comply, it won’t be tradable on regulated EU platforms. Binance, for example, has delisted USDT trading pairs for users in the European Economic Area (EEA). Other exchanges are following suit.The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) clarified that people in Europe can still hold or transfer USDT, but it can’t be offered to the public or listed on official venues. In other words, you might still have USDT in your wallet, but good luck trying to swap it on a regulated platform.                  Key reasons why Tether rejects MiCA regulations              Tether is unique in that it has explained why it wants nothing to do with MiCA regulations. The company’s leadership, especially CEO Paolo Ardoino, has been pretty vocal about what they see as serious flaws in the regulation, from financial risks to privacy concerns to the bigger picture of who stablecoins are really for.1. The banking rule could backfireOne of MiCA’s most talked-about rules says that “significant” stablecoins — like Tether’s USDt (USDT) — must keep at least 60% of their reserves in European banks. The idea is to make stablecoins safer and more transparent. But Ardoino sees it differently.He’s warned that this could create new problems, forcing stablecoin issuers to rely so heavily on traditional banks could make the whole system more fragile. After all, if there’s a wave of redemptions and those banks don’t have enough liquidity to keep up, we’d witness a struggling bank and a stablecoin crisis simultaneously.Instead, Tether prefers to keep most of its reserves in US Treasurys, assets it says are liquid, low-risk and much easier to redeem quickly if needed.2. They don’t trust the digital euroTether also has a broader issue with the direction Europe is heading, especially regarding a digital euro. Ardoino has openly criticized it, raising alarms about privacy. He has argued that a centrally controlled digital currency could be used to track how people spend their money, and even control or restrict transactions if someone falls out of favor with the system.Privacy advocates have echoed similar concerns. While the European Central Bank insists that privacy is a top priority (with features like offline payments), Tether isn’t convinced. In their eyes, putting that much financial power in the hands of one institution is asking for trouble.3. Tether’s users aren’t in Brussels. They’re in Brazil, Turkey and NigeriaAt the heart of it, Tether sees itself as a lifeline for people in countries dealing with inflation, unstable banking systems and limited access to dollars. These are places like Turkey, Argentina and Nigeria, where USDT is often more useful than the local currency.MiCA, with all its licensing hoops and reserve mandates, would require Tether to shift focus and invest heavily in meeting EU-specific standards. That’s something the company says it’s not willing to do, not at the expense of the markets it sees as most in need of financial tools like USDT.Did you know? Turkey ranks among the top countries for cryptocurrency adoption, with 16% of its population engaged in crypto activities. This high adoption rate is largely driven by the devaluation of the Turkish lira and economic instability, prompting citizens to seek alternatives like stablecoins to preserve their purchasing power.                  What happens when Tether doesn’t comply with MiCA              Tether’s decision to skip MiCA didn’t exactly fly under the radar. It’s already having real consequences, especially for exchanges and users in Europe.Exchanges are dropping USDTBig names like Binance and Kraken didn’t wait around. To stay on the right side of EU regulators, they’ve already delisted USDT trading pairs for users in the European Economic Area. Binance had removed them by the end of March 2025. Kraken followed close behind, removing not just USDT but also other non-compliant stablecoins like EURT and PayPal’s PYUSD.Users are left with fewer optionsIf you’re in Europe and holding USDT, you’re not totally out of luck; you can still withdraw or swap it on certain platforms. But you won’t be trading it on major exchanges anymore. That’s already pushing users toward alternatives like USDC and EURC, which are fully MiCA-compliant and widely supported.Even major crypto payment processors are pulling support, leaving users with fewer options for spending their crypto directly.A hit to liquidity? Probably.Pulling USDT from European exchanges could make the markets a bit shakier. Less liquidity, wider spreads and more volatility during big price moves are all on the table. Some traders will adjust quickly. Others? Not so much.Did you know? Tether (USDT) is the most traded cryptocurrency globally, surpassing even Bitcoin in daily volume. In 2024, it facilitated over $20.6 trillion in transactions and boasts a user base exceeding 400 million worldwide.                  Tether vs MiCA regulation              Tether may be out of sync with the EU, but it’s far from retreating. If anything, the company is doubling down elsewhere, looking for friendlier ground and broader horizons.Firstly, Tether’s picked El Salvador as its new base, a country that has fully embraced crypto. After getting a digital asset service provider license, the company is setting up a real headquarters there. Ardoino and other top execs are making the move too.Moreover, after banking over $5 billion in profits in early 2024, Tether is putting its capital to work:AI: Through its venture arm, Tether Evo, the company has picked up stakes in firms like Northern Data Group and Blackrock Neurotech. Tether has also launched Tether AI, an open-source, decentralized AI platform designed to operate on any device without centralized servers or API keys. The goal is to use AI to boost operations and maybe build some new tools along the way.Infrastructure and AgTech: Tether invested in Adecoagro, a company focused on sustainable farming and renewable energy. It’s a surprising move, but it fits Tether’s bigger strategy of backing real-world, resilient systems.Media and beyond: There are also signs Tether wants a footprint in content and communications, signaling it’s thinking far beyond crypto alone.                  Tether’s MiCA exit highlights crypto’s global regulatory chaos              Tether walking away from MiCA is a snapshot of a much bigger issue in crypto: How hard it is to build a business in a world where every jurisdiction plays by its own rulebook.The classic game of regulatory arbitrageThis isn’t Tether’s first rodeo when it comes to navigating regulations. Like many crypto companies, they’ve mastered the art of regulatory arbitrage, finding the friendliest jurisdiction and setting up shop there. Europe brings in strict rules? Fine, Tether sets up in El Salvador, where crypto is welcomed with open arms.However, it does raise questions. If big players can simply move jurisdictions to dodge regulations, how effective are those rules in the first place? And does that leave retail users protected or just further confused?A crypto world that’s all over the mapThe bigger issue is that the global regulatory landscape is incredibly fragmented. Europe wants full compliance, transparency and reserve mandates. The US is still sending mixed signals. Asia is split; Hong Kong is pro-crypto, while China stays cold. Hong Kong has also passed the Stablecoin Bill to license fiat-backed issuers and boost its Web3 ambitions. Meanwhile, Latin America is embracing crypto as a tool for financial access.For companies, it’s a mess. You can’t build for one global market; you must constantly adapt, restructure or pull out entirely. For users, it creates massive gaps in access. A coin available in one country might be inaccessible in another just because of local policy.As a final thought: Tether’s resistance to MiCA seems to be more than just a protest against red tape. It’s making a bet that crypto’s future will be shaped outside Brussels, not inside it.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/why-tether-refuses-to-comply-with-mica?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-23T06:27:51.000Z,"US big banks hold early talks on joint crypto stablecoin: WSJ","Some of the biggest banking companies in the US are reportedly exploring a team-up to launch a crypto stablecoin.Companies owned by JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo have discussed the possibility of jointly issuing a stablecoin, The Wall Street Journal reported on May 22, citing people familiar with the matter.Other financial institutions linked to the potential stablecoin include Early Warning Services, the parent company of digital payments network Zelle, and the payment network Clearing House.The discussions are still in the early stages, and a final decision on the project could change depending on the regulatory environment and the demand for stablecoins.A JPMorgan spokesperson told Cointelegraph the company had no comment.

2025-05-23T05:11:25.000Z,"Trendspotting in crypto: How to discover winning projects before the crowd","TL;DRSpotting the next big crypto project before it explodes demands data, discipline and a sharp eye for real signals. This guide explores how to identify early winners by analyzing onchain metrics, tokenomics, dev activity and community traction while avoiding the common traps of hype-driven pumps and red-flag projects.Despite the crypto space being crowded, fast-moving and full of noise, some investors manage to consistently find promising projects while they’re still under the radar.So, how do they do it? Crypto trendspotters know how to read onchain data. They understand tokenomics. They read GitHub commits and follow the money. It takes more than jumping on the hype bandwagon ahead of the crowd.This guide breaks down how to find crypto projects with real potential using lessons from past winners like Solana, Arbitrum, Chainlink and even memecoins like Pepe. Along the way, it will highlight the tools that matter, red flags to avoid and the difference between organic growth and manufactured buzz.How the real winners took offSolanaWhen Solana launched in 2020, few outside of developer circles had heard of it. But it had one big edge: speed. Solana’s proof-of-history tech made it one of the fastest chains around, and it quickly became a magnet for builders, especially in DeFi and NFTs. By 2021, its ecosystem exploded with apps like Serum and Magic Eden.Early adopters who paid attention to onchain growth — like wallet activity and DEX volume — could see something brewing. Solana (SOL) went from under $1 to $50+ in less than a year. Arbitrum Arbitrum launched in 2021 as an Ethereum layer 2, but its big moment came with the Arbitrum (ARB) token airdrop in March 2023. At launch, Arbitrum was already processing more transactions than many layer 1s and had billions in total value locked (TVL) in decentralized applications (DApps).Smart investors were watching. Even before the token, the signs were there: user activity, rising liquidity and growing app adoption. When ARB dropped, the pump stuck because the foundation was real.ChainlinkChainlink is a classic example of a project with long-term utility. It doesn’t have flashy branding or meme power, but it does one thing incredibly well: feed real-world data into smart contracts.By 2024, it had become the backbone of much of DeFi, gaming and even tokenized real-world assets. If you were watching closely in 2019-2020, you saw LINK (LINK) getting integrated everywhere. That kind of early utility often flies under the radar — until price action catches up.PEPE Coin (PEPE)Let’s not pretend memes don’t matter. Pepe (PEPE) launched in 2023 with no roadmap, no utility and no VC backing. But it hit a nerve, and the internet ran with it. The coin hit a billion-dollar market cap within weeks.That kind of run is rare — and risky. But for traders tracking social sentiment, wallet distribution and community activity, the early signals were all there. PEPE didn’t promise anything, but it delivered returns by becoming a viral moment.How to find crypto gems earlySo, how do you separate the next Solana from the next rug pull? Here’s how serious trendspotters approach it.1. Start with onchain metricsPublic blockchains are transparent. Use that to look at:Daily active walletsTransaction volumeTokenholder growthLiquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs)TVL (for DeFi projects).If users and capital are moving in — before the token moons — that’s a great sign. Tools like Dune Analytics, Nansen and DefiLlama are your best friends here.2. Understand the tokenomicsAsk questions like:What’s the total supply? How much is circulating?Are there upcoming unlocks or vesting cliffs?Who holds the tokens, and how concentrated are the top wallets?Is there utility? Does the token do anything?Tokens with capped supply, smart incentives (like staking or burn mechanisms) and fair distribution models tend to do better long-term.3. Check developer activityIs the team actually building?GitHub is a goldmine. Look at how often code is pushed, how many contributors are active, and whether the repo looks alive. No updates for months? Big red flag.You don’t need to read code — just track commits and releases. Projects with real traction are always shipping.4. Look for ecosystem signalsAre other developers building on top of it? Are DApps launching? Is liquidity growing? Are users coming back week after week?Ecosystem growth is hard to fake, and it’s often the strongest early indicator that a project has legs.5. Follow the communityX, Discord, Telegram, Reddit — yes, it’s noisy. But it’s also where trends start. Look beyond the price talk:Are people actually using the product?Are devs answering questions?Is the tone constructive or just hype?Use LunarCrush or Santiment to track social momentum, but always double-check it with onchain data.Key tools to spot crypto trendsHere’s a quick rundown of the top platforms used by smart crypto trendspotters:Top tip: Don’t just use one tool. Great traders cross-reference everything.Crypto trend analysis 2025A coin might be flying, but is it because people are actually using it or just talking about it? Learning to tell the difference can save you from making a bad investment. Signs of real tractionSteady user growth and TVL over time: If users are showing up before a token pumps — and the numbers keep climbing week over week — that’s usually a sign of substance. You’ll often see this in DeFi protocols or layer 2s gaining trust slowly, not overnight.Code commits and product updates: A live GitHub with regular commits, active devs and visible progress means the team is building. This shows momentum and long-term focus — not just a marketing push.More tokenholders, less whale control: When new holders join steadily — and supply isn’t all locked up by the top five wallets — it’s a healthier setup. Distributed ownership reduces the risk of rug pulls or coordinated dumps.New integrations and ecosystem activity: If other apps are integrating the token or building on the protocol, it usually means the tech is solid and useful. This kind of network effect compounds fast and often precedes a breakout.Liquidity that builds slowly: Gradual increases in liquidity and trading volume tend to reflect real interest. If liquidity sticks around (rather than vanishing after a pump), it’s usually organic.Signs of manufactured hypeSudden spikes in social mentions or trading volume with no news: If the project is everywhere on X overnight, but there’s no product update, launch or roadmap shift, be skeptical. It’s likely a coordinated shill.Influencer spam and recycled talking points: When you see multiple anonymous influencers posting the same meme or catchphrase, that’s a signal someone’s trying to manufacture buzz.No dev activity or roadmap: If there’s no GitHub, no changelog and the team isn’t shipping anything, it’s probably just a hype machine.Anonymous team, outrageous promises: Combine a mystery team with claims like “100x guaranteed,” and you’re likely looking at a cash grab. Real builders let the work speak for itself.Rule of thumb: If the price is moving and everything else — users, devs, integrations — is standing still, you’re looking at hype. But when those fundamentals are quietly ticking up in the background? That’s when it’s worth a closer look.More red flagsSome projects look great on the surface — slick websites, trending hashtags, a fast-moving chart — but fall apart under the hood. Here are some more red flags to watch out for:High holder concentration: If most of the token is sitting in a handful of wallets, it doesn’t take much for a price crash. Whales often buy early and dump on retail.Unverified token contracts: A token that hasn’t been verified on Etherscan or BscScan might hide functions that allow minting, blocking wallets or draining liquidity. Always check the contract or look for an audit.No liquidity lock or audit: If the devs control all the liquidity provider tokens and there’s no lock or time-locked contract, they can pull the rug at any moment. Similarly, no third-party audit? That’s a gamble.Big token unlocks coming up: Large unlocks for insiders or early investors can trigger huge sell-offs. If you’re holding during a major vesting event, you could be exit liquidity. Know the schedule.Top tip: Before you click buy, ask, Who stands to gain the most if this pumps? Who gets hurt if it dumps? If the answer points to a few insiders with heavy bags and zero accountability, walk away.How to spot crypto trends before the crowdThe best early investors are the mechanics looking under the hood. They study token structures and unlock schedules, join communities early to catch signals firsthand, and follow the builders to see who’s actually shipping. Most importantly, they cross-check everything: on-chain data, social sentiment, developer activity, and liquidity. Tools like Dune, DefiLlama, Nansen and GitHub help them separate noise from substance — and spot winners before the crowd does.Crypto rewards those who are curious, critical and a little bit contrarian. The crowd usually shows up late. If you want to find gems before they moon, you’ll need to think independently, dig deeper, and act before the narrative forms.It’s not easy. But it’s doable. And the more you practice spotting early signals — the real ones, not the noise — the more second nature it becomes.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

It would also prohibit state officials from advocating or supporting a proposed CBDC from the federal government.The bill defines advocating or supporting a CBDC to involve issuing a memorandum or official statement endorsing a CBDC proposal related to its testing, adoption or implementation.Source: Bitcoin LawsMichigan to consider two crypto mining billsHB 4512, the third crypto bill introduced by a bipartisan group led by Democratic Representative Mike McFall, would create a Bitcoin mining program allowing operators to set up at abandoned oil and gas sites. A supervisor would be assigned to determine how much oil or gas could reasonably be expected to be produced from the site, who the last operator of the site was and how long it has been left unused.Related: US Senate moves forward with GENIUS stablecoin billThose seeking to participate in the program would need to submit legal documents outlining their organizational structure, demonstrate their ability to operate as a Bitcoin mining entity and provide estimates of the breakeven price for a profitable venture.The fourth bill, HB 4513 — also filed by a McFall-led bipartisan group — would amend Michigan’s income tax laws to include income obtained from the proposed Bitcoin mining program.Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/michigan-lawmakers-introduce-four-crypto-bills?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

According to a report from My London, Jacob Irwin-Cline went out to a London bar and had several drinks before calling an Uber to take him home.Cline said that he did not thoroughly check the details of the Uber ride on his phone and left with a random private cab driver resembling the Uber driver at first glance, but driving a different vehicle — a detail Cline would only discover after the incident.Once inside the vehicle, the US tourist said the driver offered him a cigarette, which Cline said was likely laced with a rare and potent sedative drug called scopolamine. Cline added that the cigarette made him feel extremely docile and tired, causing him to pass out for around 30 minutes before regaining consciousness.Shortly after Cline woke up, the driver ordered him out of the vehicle. As Cline exited, the driver suddenly sped off, striking him with the car and fleeing with his cellphone, which contained his private keys and access to his crypto accounts.The unfortunate incident comes amid a recent spate of kidnappings, extortion incidents, armed robberies, and ransom attempts directed at crypto industry executives, investors, and their families.

However, Noizat's daughter and another individual were able to fight off the masked attackers.The rise in violent attacks against crypto investors and professionals has prompted an increase in personal security, including requests for bodyguards and private security measures for those likely to be victimized.Magazine: China’s ‘point running’ crypto scams, pig butchers kidnap kids: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/american-tourist-drugged-fake-uber-driver-robbed-123k-btc?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The proposed amendment would come after 18 Democrats sided with Republicans in the Senate in voting to advance the bill on May 20 after it failed a procedural vote on May 8.“Passing the GENIUS Act without our anti-corruption amendment stamps a Congressional seal of approval on Trump selling access and influence to the highest bidder,” Merkley said in a May 22 X post.Trump his three sons are involved in the crypto platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI), which launched its USD1 stablecoin in March. Critics have pointed out that the president could continue to personally benefit from legislation that helps recognize stablecoins like USD1 as financial instruments in the US. Related: US lawmaker introduces anti-corruption bill ahead of Trump’s dinnerAn Abu Dhabi-based investment firm said that it would use USD1 to settle a $2-billion investment in Binance, effectively allowing the president’s family to profit from the transaction fees. Democratic lawmakers have already called for an investigation into Trump’s connections to the platform, which was largely dismissed as “flawed” by WLFI co-founder Zach Witkoff.Stablecoins are just one of many potential conflicts, say DemocratsMerkley and Warren are also planning responses to Trump hosting a dinner at his golf club for up to 220 people who purchased the most significant amounts of his personal memecoin. Merkley is expected to attend a protest organized by the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, in partnership with progressive political organization Our Revolution, outside the Trump venue on May 22. Warren held a press conference with Merkley, Senator Chris Murphy and Public Citizen representatives, calling on Trump to “release the guest list” for the dinner event. Though a few of the potential attendees have publicly announced they were the owners of the wallets who purchased the memecoin and intended to go, the majority were still anonymous at the time of publication.“What is happening tonight — this private, secret dinner — in which individuals who have put money in Donald Trump’s pocket, get access to him, is maybe the most corrupt of all the corruption,” said Murphy, adding:“They were able to pay their way in to get an audience with the President of the United States to ask for favorable national security concessions.”Cointelegraph reached out to the White House for comment, but had not received a response at the time of publication.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/senators-amendment-genius-act-world-liberty-financial-stablecoin?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Far from being bearish, the current level leaves room for bullish positioning on XRP futures markets.Related: Which senators invest in crypto? 11 lawmakers have blockchain-related investmentsFavorable regulation opens the door for new partnerships and acquisitionsPart of the limited XRP price upside can be explained by the multiple rejections of US Senator Cynthia Lummis, Chair of the US Congress Digital Assets Subcommittee, to meet Ripple representatives. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse asked on May 19 that the lawmaker “reconsider and be a leader for ALL of crypto,” and discuss “how to make the US the crypto capital of the world.”There is nothing stopping XRP from hitting $3.50 or even higher, as Ripple Labs is no longer facing direct threats from regulators, which paves the way for partnerships and acquisitions. Historically, XRP has reacted very positively following those announcements, and the $2.2 billion futures open interest could help catapult XRP price above the current $3.25 all-time high.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

However, SOL needs a clear market structure break (MSB) or a decisive bullish breakout above $180 to trigger the next leg of the rally. Declining volumes during the consolidation phase suggest caution, as a lack of buying pressure could stall the breakout. If SOL fails to breach $180, the immediate key area of interest is between $140-150, and the bull flag pattern would be invalidated.

2025-05-22T15:00:00.000Z,"Semiconductor exemptions don’t matter when it comes to tariffs","Opinion by: Ahmad Shadid of O.xyzSemiconductors scored a rare exemption from US President Donald Trump’s aggressive reciprocal tariffs, but the relief is symbolic at best. Most semiconductors enter the US embedded in servers, GPUs, laptops, and smartphones. The finished goods remain heavily tariffed, some with duties reaching up to 49%. The exemption looks good politically but delivers little practical benefit. Nvidia’s DGX systems, crucial for training advanced AI models, do not fall under the exempted HTS codes. Nvidia could pay effective tariffs nearing 40% on these vital components. Such costs threaten to stall critical AI infrastructure projects across the country. Semiconductor tariffs may compromise the goal of the CHIPS Act. The act promised tens of billions of dollars in subsidies to support domestic chip manufacturing. Yet advanced lithography machines — key equipment from countries like the Netherlands and Japan — face 20%–24% tariffs. Ironically, tariffs designed to boost American production increase the cost of essential manufacturing equipment.The effect of new tariffs is already slowing progress in critical supply chains — just as generative AI and large language models are gaining momentum across sectors like finance and defense. Any delays or cost increases now could blunt America’s technological advantage.Indirect costs undermine exemptions for AIModern semiconductor supply chains are global and highly integrated. An exemption on raw silicon means nothing when servers, GPUs and other finished products face steep tariffs. Tariffs indirectly inflate costs, eliminating any competitive advantage from domestic manufacturing.Indirect tariff costs hit high-end systems disproportionately hard. The effect ripples through AI model training, data center expansions and major infrastructure projects, significantly slowing the industry’s momentum.Tariff impasse halts investmentSo far, it’s clear that the US president’s tariff plan didn’t follow any conventional economic trends or calculated strategy. The uncertain tariff situation stalls investment decisions across the technology sector. Companies need predictable costs to justify large capital expenditures. Ongoing tariff volatility prevents them from committing resources to new data centers and manufacturing lines.This mirrors the supply chain chaos of 2020. At that time, uncertainty caused massive order cancellations and slowed industry recovery for years. If tariff ambiguity continues, we could see similar waves of cancellations in 2025. This would further compound existing inventory and revenue issues in the semiconductor sector.Domestic production is not optimalThe border argument for these tariffs is that they’re meant to boost domestic production. They do little, however, to encourage genuine domestic semiconductor production. Despite subsidies under the CHIPS Act, most US semiconductor companies still rely on international foundries for manufacturing. Instead, they face increased equipment and operational costs.Recent: How trade wars impact stocks and cryptoThe idea that tariffs promote domestic production ignores the reality of global semiconductor manufacturing. Costs rise across the board, putting American companies at a disadvantage rather than offering protection.AI projects face heightened riskThe blockchain and crypto sectors, particularly AI-driven projects, also feel the pinch. Projects depend heavily on GPUs and high-performance servers for mining, validating transactions and running decentralized AI computations. Increased hardware costs directly affect profitability and growth, potentially stalling innovation in blockchain applications. AI developments have just started to pick up the pace in the blockchain and Web3 space. The industry saw increased interest from investors and VCs just a year ago. So, they are still on tighter budgets. Elevated costs can, however, lead to stagnation. We might see innovators and developers exiting the market. The ripple effect extends beyond the general technology sector and could threaten future digital economies. Moreover, these cost pressures disproportionately affect startups and smaller tech firms. Industry giants can absorb additional expenses, but innovative, smaller players face existential threats. This dynamic risks stifling innovation at the grassroots level, harming the entire tech ecosystem.What to expect Semiconductors have momentarily escaped direct tariffs, but the exemption provides little benefit. Tariffs continue to hit finished products, driving up indirect costs across the industry. Instead of boosting domestic manufacturing, these tariffs create economic paralysis, stall critical infrastructure projects, and threaten America’s lead in AI innovation. Policymakers must acknowledge these realities and adjust their approach before irreversible damage is done to the nation’s technological future.Opinion by: Ahmad Shadid of O.xyz.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

When you do, you don’t own enough NFT’s, as art is upstream of wealth. Both will never be this cheap again,” Pal said.NFTs are “the single best long term store of wealth I know and you get to buy it before network effects kick in,” he added in another response.Source: Raoul Pal“There is some validity to the statement that NFTs, and in extension art, become a vehicle for the wealthy once a certain level of wealth is reached,” wrote Nicolai Sondergaard, research analyst at Nansen, calling it a “natural move” for asset diversification.“For traders and investors, further down the wealth curve, NFTs are partially about speculating on future returns,” he told Cointelegraph, adding that NFTs also benefit from the allure of strong communities, beyond just wealth creation.Related: German gov’t missed out on $2.3B profit after selling Bitcoin at $57KArt NFTs may see a resurgence as “digital ownership gains acceptance among younger, tech-savvy cohorts,” if collections manage to move past the “speculative fervor,” according to Anndy Lian, author and intergovernmental blockchain expert.Still, Lian said broader adoption depends on blockchain networks improving scalability and security to “instill confidence.” He added that art NFTs “must transcend hype, anchoring value in cultural significance or utility.”  Beeple’s “Everydays: The First 5000 Days.” Source: ChristiesSome digital artists made millions of dollars through NFTs.

2025-05-22T13:30:00.000Z,"How staking incentivizes trust without burning energy","What if a financial system could run itself not by burning electricity, but by rewarding good behavior? That’s the promise of staking, a mechanism that powers many modern blockchains by turning users into network operators. In this week’s episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Gareth Jenkinson and Nathan Jeffay sit down with StarkWare’s Noam Nisan to unpack how this trustless engine works, why it matters and what’s really at stake.Understanding stakingJeffay began by highlighting how staking is part of the backbone that keeps the blockchain running, and runs itself, with volunteers.“By doing this, they’re saying, OK, we’re taking this task of running the blockchain seriously. Here's some of our money. We're putting it down. We're showing that we're serious about doing this.”To help unpack this topic further and examine the deeper mechanics behind staking, the hosts are joined by Noam Nisan, principal researcher at StarkWare and a widely respected computer scientist who has held roles at Google and Princeton.Related: How to handle crypto trading gains and losses on your balance sheet“So we have this general system with operators... Why would they want to do that? The system, the protocol, incentivizes them to actually run the system,” Nisan explained. “Basically, it can give them tokens for operating the system.”Staking offers what Nisan describes as two distinct types of security: computer science-based guarantees and economic disincentives for bad actors. “If a majority or supermajority, maybe two-thirds of the parties of the token of the staked amount are behaving properly... we can prove that the system acts correctly,” he said. “But you also have what I would call an economic guarantee... if they destroy the system, very likely the value of the token... will go down. So they are the one losing.”PoW vs PoSJenkinson, a vocal Bitcoin (BTC) supporter, posed the classic comparison: proof-of-work vs proof-of-stake. “Do you have any strong feelings about one or the other?” he asked.“The truth is that it’s not clear.. it's really a social question, I think.”Nisan noted that both mechanisms involve trade-offs around cost, control, and decentralization. The episode also explores the role of staking in tokenomics and system design. Nisan unpacks how fee mechanics and inflation controls, such as Ethereum’s minting curve, help keep the ecosystem in balance.To hear the full conversation on The Clear Crypto Podcast,  listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

2025-05-22T12:38:44.000Z,"UK court partially dismisses Bitcoin SV investor’s lawsuit against Binance","The United Kingdom’s Court of Appeal has partially dismissed a lawsuit brought by Bitcoin SV investors against major crypto exchanges, including Binance, for allegedly conspiring to delist the token in 2019.In a judgment handed down on May 21, the court ruled that investors who held BSV through the delisting period (classified as “sub-class B”) were not entitled to billions in speculative damages based on BSV’s hypothetical growth.These investors had claimed over 8.9 billion British pounds ($11.9 billion) in damages, asserting that Binance’s delisting deprived holders of the chance to profit from BSV’s potential rise to a “top-tier cryptocurrency” like Bitcoin (BTC) or Bitcoin Cash (BCH).The court rejected this “foregone growth effect” theory, stating, “BSV was obviously not a unique cryptocurrency without reasonably similar substitutes,” pointing to the representative’s own use of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash as comparators.Sub-class B’s central claim was that delisting led to a missed opportunity to benefit from price appreciation. However, the court determined that those investors had ample chance to mitigate losses by selling or reinvesting in other crypto assets.“They had a duty to mitigate their losses,” wrote Master of the Rolls Sir Geoffrey Vos. “They cannot recover losses that they could reasonably have mitigated.”UK court ruling against Bitcoin SV investor’s lawsuit.

The court ruled it “flawed as a matter of principle,” noting that “cryptocurrencies are, by their nature, volatile investments.”Binance’s limited strike-out application ultimately succeeded, with the court stating that even if some holders were unaware of the delisting, “they could never claim more than the total value of their holding before the delisting events plus any quantifiable consequential losses.”Related: Binance wants arbitration for all members of securities class suitBinance seeks to dismiss FTX lawsuitOn May 16, Binance filed a motion to dismiss a $1.76 billion lawsuit filed by the FTX estate, arguing that the claims are legally flawed and an attempt to shift responsibility for FTX’s collapse.The exchange stated the downfall of FTX stemmed from internal fraud, not external manipulation, citing Sam Bankman-Fried’s conviction on multiple fraud charges.Binance has asked the court to dismiss all claims with prejudice.

Source: DeBankTrader loses out on $2.6 million gainWith ETH up over 70% since the sale, the trader lost out on over 1,000 ETH, or roughly $2.67 million, in the process of buying back in. If the trader decided to hold on to their Ether, the assets would be worth about $6.7 million. As ETH rallied, the asset surpassed the market capitalization of big companies like Coca-Cola and Alibaba. At the time of writing, company data tracker 8marketcap shows that Ether’s $321 billion market capitalization makes it the 38th most-valuable asset in the world, surpassing the pharmaceutical company AbbVie and inching closer to the Bank of America. Ether’s upswing is largely fueled by the successful launch of its Pectra upgrade. The new update introduced improvements to the network’s scalability, validator user experience and smart wallet functionality. These updates are expected to drive broader adoption of the Ethereum mainnet. Related: Bitcoin open interest hits record high as bulls stampede toward new BTC price highsETH leads crypto investment products with $205 million weekly inflowsAlong with its recent price appreciation, ETH-based investment products in the United States also saw renewed interest. A May 19 report from digital asset manager CoinShares revealed that US crypto investment products saw $785 million in inflows last week.

2025-05-22T10:21:18.000Z,"Can ChatGPT-powered AI agents really trade crypto for you?","Key takeawaysChatGPT-powered AI agents automate trading tasks using natural language prompts and API integrations, improving speed and consistency.Successes occur when ChatGPT is used as a support tool, not a fully autonomous trading system.Failures happen when traders over-rely on ChatGPT without real-time data, proper risk management or manual oversight.Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance.What if a crypto trader didn’t need to constantly check charts, worry about emotions, or stay up all night watching for sudden price swings? What if those tasks could be handled by an intelligent agent that understands instructions in plain English — and reacts within milliseconds? That’s where ChatGPT-powered AI agents come in.These tools combine natural language processing with real-time trading logic to automate decision-making in one of the world’s most volatile markets. From rebalancing portfolios to reacting to market sentiment, ChatGPT is being adapted to act as a trading assistant, risk manager and market analyst — all rolled into one. But can it truly match or even outperform human intuition? This article explores how far these agents have come, where they shine and where they still fall short.How ChatGPT-powered AI agents operate in cryptocurrency marketsChatGPT-powered AI agents are changing how people interact with crypto markets. These tools combine ChatGPT’s language abilities with external trading tools and APIs to help users monitor prices, understand trends and even place trades automatically. Instead of just reacting to charts or numbers, ChatGPT can understand plain language commands like “Buy Ethereum if the price drops below $2,000” or “Sell Bitcoin if RSI goes above 70.”These AI trading assistants can work with major platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, OKX and other centralized or decentralized exchanges and can also tap into decentralized finance (DeFi) tools and smart contracts. With the right setup, ChatGPT can help automate trading strategies based on both technical data and market news.Success stories vs. failures in ChatGPT-powered crypto tradingSome traders have used ChatGPT to assist in automating parts of their crypto trading processes, particularly for strategy generation and sentiment analysis. For example, a user shared on Reddit that they used a ChatGPT-based AI agent for technical analysis on Ether (ETH), feeding it four-hour and daily chart screenshots. By interpreting market sentiment, support and resistance zones, and other indicators, they managed to make $6,500 in profits.Similarly, in the broader crypto sector, ChatGPT has been applied to support project development activities such as drafting white papers and marketing content. A notable example is the launch of the “TURBO” memecoin, which reportedly reached a market capitalization of over $50 million in 2024. In this case, ChatGPT was used to streamline documentation and communication rather than manage trading activity, illustrating its usefulness as a support tool in crypto-related initiatives.However, limitations are evident when ChatGPT is applied beyond its core design. While ChatGPT could suggest a trading portfolio and explain its reasoning clearly, it lacks access to real-time market data and couldn’t respond to sudden volatility. In one instance, ChatGPT was allocated $100 across multiple tokens but failed to actively manage the portfolio as prices fluctuated. This resulted in missed opportunities and underperformance compared to dynamic algorithmic strategies.Individual experiences reinforce these observations. A Redditor exposed a scam where a YouTuber promoted a “ChatGPT trading bot” tutorial that led users to deploy malicious smart contracts. The contracts, generated using ChatGPT and passed off as safe, were designed to drain user wallets once funded. Victims collectively lost $17,240 in ETH, highlighting the danger of blindly trusting AI-generated code without proper auditing.Even when asked, “If I use ChatGPT to build an AI agent for crypto trading, can I become a millionaire?” ChatGPT responded with a realistic outlook — acknowledging that while it’s possible, success depends on having a profitable strategy, disciplined risk management, and the ability to scale effectively.Here is ChatGPT’s response:These cases suggest that while ChatGPT can support certain elements of the trading process, it should not be treated as a standalone solution for autonomous crypto trading.AI in crypto trading: Key benefits and limitationsAI tools like ChatGPT are increasingly being integrated into crypto trading workflows to improve speed, accuracy and efficiency. While they offer important advantages, they also carry specific limitations that traders must actively manage. Below are the main benefits and challenges:Key benefits of using AI for crypto tradingAI bots can execute trades in milliseconds, crucial for capturing opportunities in fast-moving crypto markets.Bots follow pre-programmed rules precisely, eliminating emotional biases that often affect human traders.Crypto markets are always open, and AI bots can monitor and act around the clock without interruption.A single bot can manage multiple trading pairs, exchanges and strategies simultaneously.ChatGPT can understand specific prompts like “Rebalance every Monday” or “Set stop-loss at 5%,” allowing flexible automation.Limitations of ChatGPT in cryptocurrency tradingChatGPT does not access live market data unless specifically integrated with external APIs (e.g., TradingView, CoinMarketCap or exchange websockets).Instructions must be clear and unambiguous; ChatGPT may misinterpret vague or complex commands.Improperly secured API keys or lack of two-factor authentication (2FA) can expose trading accounts to unauthorized access.ChatGPT’s cloud-based infrastructure can introduce latency, which could impact performance during highly volatile periods.ChatGPT does not monitor regional compliance rules; users must manually enforce trading limits based on local regulations.Ethical and regulatory implications of AI in crypto tradingAs AI becomes more integrated into trading systems, it raises significant ethical and regulatory concerns that stakeholders across the financial sector are beginning to address.Accountability: If an AI agent executes a harmful or unlawful trade, questions arise around legal responsibility. It remains unclear in many jurisdictions whether liability falls primarily on the developer, the trader using the AI system or the platform facilitating the transactions.Market manipulation risks: Autonomous AI bots could unintentionally engage in activities such as spoofing (placing and canceling fake orders to mislead the market) or wash trading (creating artificial volume), especially if not properly programmed with compliance safeguards.Regulatory oversight: Financial authorities, including the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the European Securities and Markets Authority, are actively studying the implications of AI and algorithmic trading. These agencies have recognized that traditional trading regulations may not fully account for autonomous decision-making by AI systems.Policy developments: In January 2024, the European Commission released updates to its Digital Finance Strategy, which included references to AI-based financial services. While not yet finalized, these draft regulations under the broader Digital Finance Package signal a move toward stricter compliance expectations for firms deploying AI in financial markets.Meanwhile, ethical crypto platforms are beginning to voluntarily disclose the use of trading bots in their systems. In parallel, open-source communities are advocating for clearer audit trails, improved model transparency and the establishment of ethical guidelines for AI applications in finance to ensure accountability and fairness.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-22T08:37:57.000Z,"Dubai regulator clarifies real-world asset tokenization rules: Lawyer","Newly updated guidelines from Dubai’s crypto regulator include provisions on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and clarify rules for issuers. On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) released its updated Rulebook for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) operating in the region. The regulator gave market participants until June 19 to comply with the new rules. The regulator previously told Cointelegraph that it had enhanced supervisory mechanisms and brought consistency across activity-based rules. One of the more prominent changes includes regulatory clarity on RWA tokens. Irina Heaver, partner at the United Arab Emirates-based law firm NeosLegal, told Cointelegraph that the updated rules clarify RWA issuance and distribution. “Issuing real-world asset tokens and listing them on secondary markets is no longer theoretical,” Heaver told Cointelegraph. “It’s now a regulatory reality in Dubai and the broader UAE.”A “viable” path to realize RWA hypeHeaver compared RWAs to security token offerings (STOs), an earlier attempt from the crypto space to tokenize securities like stocks, bonds and real estate investment trusts. However, the UAE crypto lawyer said that STOs “died a peaceful death in 2018 to 2019.” The lawyer told Cointelegraph STOs did not work out because of the lack of regulatory clarity, viable secondary market trading venues, institutional investor appetite and liquidity. Still, the situation is different for RWAs. Heaver told Cointelegraph that RWAs are the next foundational layer for institutional adoption of blockchain and virtual assets. Heaver said that VARA’s new rules already cover them as Asset-Referenced Virtual Assets (ARVA) tokens. She said: “VARA’s newly updated Virtual Asset Issuance Rulebook (May 2025) addresses these failures head-on. Regulated exchanges and broker-dealers in Dubai are now authorized to distribute and list ARVA tokens.”The lawyer said this solves an issue in jurisdictions like Switzerland, where token issuance is possible, but listing and secondary trading remain unregulated. Related: Dubai gov’t agencies to link real estate registry with property tokenizationLawyer shares requirements for RWA issuersHeaver said ARVA tokens are defined under Dubai law as representing direct or indirect ownership of real-world assets, granting entitlement to receive or share income and purporting to maintain a stable value by reference to real-world assets or income. ARVA tokens are also backed or collateralised by such real-world assets or constitute a derivative, wrapped, duplicated, or fractionalised version of another ARVA. The lawyer said issuers must meet specific requirements, including a Category 1 Virtual Asset Issuance license, a comprehensive white paper and a risk disclosure statement. In addition, issuers must have a paid-up capital of 1.5 million UAE dirhams (about $408,000) or 2% of reserve assets held. The issuers are also subjected to monthly independent audit obligations and must adhere to ongoing supervisory oversight. “VARA is providing regulatory clarity, and it’s giving the industry a viable, enforceable path to turn the hype of RWA tokenization into reality,” Heaver told Cointelegraph. “This matters because it marks a shift, from theory to execution, from fiction to framework.”Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/dubai-vara-guidelines-rwa-tokenization-clarity?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-22T08:25:00.000Z,"5 red flags you’re being shilled: Don’t buy the hype","What is shilling in crypto?              At its core, shilling is the act of artificially promoting a cryptocurrency or token, often with exaggerated claims, to increase its price or popularity. But what’s the goal? Hype it up, get others to buy in, and then cash out, leaving latecomers holding the bag.Shilling can come from anyone: influencers, anonymous accounts or even high-profile figures with political or financial clout. The common thread is manipulation: It’s not about educating you or building real value but pumping hype for personal gain.Unfortunately, the line between enthusiastic promotion and outright deception can be thin, and many fall victim without realizing it. That’s why it’s critical to learn how to spot the signs early.                  5 red flags you’re being shilled              Beware of crypto red flags like overhyped promises, anonymous teams, influencer shills, missing products and FOMO tactics — if it smells like a scam, it probably is.1. Overhyped promises You’ve probably seen posts that scream:“100x potential!”“Guaranteed returns!”“This is your ticket to financial freedom!”These are classic shill tactics. Real, credible projects don’t promise life-changing profits. Why? Because there are no guarantees in crypto or in any investment.When a project leads with grandiose financial claims rather than actual product value or utility, it’s likely a ploy to stir FOMO and attract unsuspecting investors. The truth is, if something sounds too good to be true, it almost always is.Remember: The bigger the promise, the bigger the red flag.2. Anonymous or suspicious teams In crypto, anonymity isn’t always bad, but when you’re trusting people with your money, transparency matters.It’s a major red flag when a project has:No identifiable team membersFake names or aliasesStock photos on its websiteNo LinkedIn or professional history.The simple rule is “No face, no funds.”Scammers often hide behind anonymity because they know they’ll eventually vanish and there’ll be no one to hold accountable. Even worse, some use fabricated credentials or hire actors to pose as team members.Before investing, check whether the founders or developers have any verifiable history. Do they have prior experience in blockchain or startups? Have they launched anything successful before?3. Influencer spam and paid promotions One day, no one’s talking about a particular coin — the next, your feed is flooded with influencers hyping it up. Sound familiar?This sudden burst of attention is often coordinated with a paid promotion campaign disguised as “genuine enthusiasm.”Many influencers fail to disclose sponsorships, even though it’s required by law in many countries. The US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have cracked down on this in recent years.Take, for example:Kim Kardashian, who was fined $1.26 million in 2022 for promoting EthereumMax without proper disclosure.Floyd Mayweather Jr., who was sued for endorsing the same project at a paid event.BitBoy (Ben Armstrong), who faced legal action in multiple lawsuits for promoting scam tokens to his audience.If you notice multiple influencers promoting the same project in a short time, especially without using labels like #ad or #sponsored, it’s a strong indicator of a shill campaign.Don’t mistake volume for value. Hype doesn’t equal legitimacy.4. No real product or roadmapIf you visit the project’s website, it looks sleek, maybe even impressive. But where’s the product? Where’s the code?Shilled tokens often rely on flashy marketing but have no working application, no GitHub code and no actual use case. Everything is either “coming soon” or buried behind vague promises.Ask yourself:Can I use the platform or app today?Is there a white paper that makes sense?Do they have public repositories or open development?If all you’re seeing is a landing page and a vague roadmap that’s been “coming soon” for months, that’s a major red flag.5. Pressure tactics and FOMO Time pressure is a psychological weapon, and shillers know how to use it.Watch out for lines such as:“Presale ends in 2 hours!”“Only 1,000 spots left!”“If you don’t buy now, you’ll miss out forever!”These tactics prey on your fear of missing out (FOMO) and push you into making impulsive decisions without research.But crypto isn’t a sprint; it’s a long-term game. Anyone trying to rush you into buying likely has something to hide. Solid investments don’t need fake urgency.Take a breath, step back, and ask yourself: Am I buying because I believe in this project or because I’m being manipulated?Did you know? The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) secured a $128-million judgment against Ryan Mitchell Pope, Daniel Samuel Bishop and their company EmpiresX for operating a fraudulent forex and cryptocurrency investment scheme that defrauded over 12,500 victims.                  Is shilling illegal in crypto? Can influencers be sued?              Shilling isn’t just unethical in many cases — it’s also illegal.In the world of crypto, undisclosed promotions are a major legal risk. If someone is paid to promote a token or project but fails to reveal that financial connection, they could face fines, lawsuits or even criminal charges. This is especially true if the promoted token is later classified as a security under US law.Regulators like the SEC, FTC and CFTC have all cracked down on this behavior. Their targets have included:Influencers who failed to disclose paid promotionsPromoters who misled investors with false claimsIndividuals who ran pump-and-dump schemes using social media.Francier Obando Pinillo, a pastor from Miami, was indicted on 26 fraud counts for running a crypto scam through “Solano Fi,” defrauding investors of millions from 2021 to 2023. He allegedly used his church, social media and false promises of 34.9% monthly returns to lure victims. The platform showed fake gains but blocked withdrawals, while funds were diverted for personal use. Pinillo was arraigned in Richland, Washington and faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.As crypto becomes more mainstream, expect stricter regulations and more consequences for shillers.Did you know? Argentine President Javier Milei has dissolved the special task force investigating the LIBRA cryptocurrency scandal, a project he promoted in February 2025 that surged to a $4.5-billion valuation before crashing by over 97%. The task force, created by Milei himself, was disbanded via Decree 332/2025, citing that it had fulfilled its purpose. However, critics argue that no official findings were released, and judicial investigations into Milei and his associates continue.                  How to protect yourself from shilling scams              Do your own research, verify the team and utility, ignore hype and influencers, and stay alert to pump-and-dump schemes to avoid crypto shilling traps.Let’s understand how you can protect yourself from shilling scams in crypto:Do your own research (DYOR): Always research the project, the team behind it and the data supporting the claims. Don’t rely solely on hype or influencer recommendations. Look into onchain data, GitHub activity and the project’s utility to make informed decisions.Verify the team: A legitimate crypto project should have a transparent and credible team. If the developers are anonymous or have no professional profiles (like LinkedIn), that’s a red flag. Always check the team’s past projects and credibility before investing.Look for real utility: Does this project actually solve a problem? A genuine project should have a working product or solution, not just promises. Avoid projects that lack real-world utility or are still in “coming soon” stages for extended periods.Ignore the hype: If a token is suddenly trending on social media or being aggressively promoted, don’t let FOMO influence your judgment. Shillers often rely on emotions to push their agenda, so it’s essential to evaluate projects based on their merits, not just popularity.Stay skeptical of influencers: Influencers with large followings may be paid to promote certain tokens. Before taking their advice, ask yourself, What’s their incentive? Verify the promotion is legitimate and disclosed as paid or sponsored. Always cross-check the information with independent sources.Watch for pump-and-dump schemes: Be cautious of sudden price spikes followed by rapid drops. These are often signs of pump-and-dump schemes where the token’s value is artificially inflated by coordinated buying and then quickly sold off, leaving investors with losses. Always monitor price trends and be wary of sudden, unexplained increases in value.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/5-red-flags-youre-being-shilled-dont-buy-the-hype?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
