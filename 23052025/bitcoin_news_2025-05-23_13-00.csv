Wynn recently claimed to have earned $46 million from his Bitcoin positions to date. Hyperliquid whale James Wynn, who shared the latest status of his profile from the X account, said that he started making profits in the range of $ 110,000-111,000 in Bitcoin. Wynn said that despite the small pullback, Bitcoin will continue to rise and that he expects Bitcoin to reach $115,000-118,000 very soon. Stating that Bitcoin will probably rise to $122,000, Wynn stated that he expects a period of consolidation after this peak and believes that this will pave the way for the next altcoin season. “I reduced the position size today, making a profit of around $110,000 – $111,000. In my opinion, Bitcoin is itching to go higher. My goal remains the same at 115-118k by next weekend. However, it could easily happen in just a few hours. I think Bitcoin will reach 118k-122k and we will see a cooling and sideways movement, then things will get really interesting and alt season will come.” He Said Altcoin Season Is Coming: Ethereum After Bitcoin! Known for his high-risk transactions, big whale James Wynn opened a long position in Ethereum after Bitcoin. According to Lookonchain’s post, James Wynn recently made a bold move on Ethereum, opening a 25x leveraged long position worth $60.4 million at an entry price of $2,666.31. “Top trader James Wynn opened a long position on Ethereum with 25x leverage. His position reached 22,548 ETH ($60.4 million). Entry price: $2,666.31 / Unrealized profit: $270K” In addition to Bitcoin and Ethereum, Wynn has a $26.77 million long position in memecoin kPEPE with 10x leverage. That position remains active and in profit. However, not all of Wynn’s trades are in the green. A 10x leveraged long position on SUI is currently in the red. The entry price on the SUI position was $3.97064 and it is currently at a loss of $497k.

2025-05-23T10:46:07.000Z,"As Trump Sparks Anger with Memecoin Dinner, Buy These Best Meme Coins Instead","‘President Trump makes people mad’ isn’t exactly breaking news. But even by his standards, last night’s memecoin dinner for the top 200 buyers of his $TRUMP meme coin is really setting people off. Democrats are livid at what they see as blatant corruption, selling access to the most powerful man in the world. And even some crypto lobbyists have concerns over the optics of shilling meme coins just when key regulators like the CFTF and the SEC are starting to finally take crypto seriously. Even as Trump stirs up a ruckus (again), the best meme coins continue to make waves. U Mad, Bro? Trump making opponents angry is a feature, not a bug. The spark that triggered the latest wave of outrage came over a Thursday gala dinner Trump threw for the 220 biggest purchasers of his crypto token $TRUMP , launched in January. No one outside the Trump organization knows the exact guest list, but at least one name has surfaced – and it hasn’t done anything to cool the mood. The top attendee was Justin Sun, founder of Tron, who recently returned to the US for a country-wide tour. The visit comes after Sun, who was sued by the SEC for fraud, finally saw the case dropped in February. Tron remains a highly successful blockchain, both with the $TRON altcoin and as a major blockchain for $USDT transactions. Sun has become a one-man crypto promo machine, unafraid to say anything. He’s controversial, provocative, and in hindsight probably the perfect headliner for the Trump gala. Other attendees included notable pseudonymous crypto influencers, like MemeCore founder Ice and celebrity coin launcher EV, alongside real-world celebrities like former NBA star Lamar Odom. The lack of transparency over who attended was just another black mark against the event in the eyes of Trump’s opponents, raising vocal opposition from long-time objectors like Elizabeth Warren. Even as Trump stirs up a ruckus (again), the best meme coins continue to make waves. Instead of $TRUMP, here are three memecoins to consider. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Bitcoin Hits $110K, Primes First-Ever $BTC Memecoin for Success A first-of-its-kind Bitcoin meme coin launching just when $BTC hits a new all-time-high? Now that’s bullish indeed. BTC Bull token ($BTCBULL) couldn’t be launched at a better time. The attitude around the crypto world is as bullish as ever, and $BTCBULL intends to make the most of it. The project uses an innovative structure that connects the $BTCBULL token price to Bitcoin’s continued rise. Every time Bitcoin reaches one of six key price milestones, the BTC Bull Token project responds with either a token burn or an airdrop. $BTC $125K – $BTCBULL token burn $BTC $150K – $BTC token airdrop! $BTC $175K – $BTCBULL token burn $BTC $200K – $BTC token airdrop! $BTC $225K – $BTCBULL token burn $BTC $250K – $BTCBULL token airdrop! The token burns exert deflationary pressure on $BTCBULL’s token supply, driving the price upward. The $BTC airdrops – available to investors who hold $BTCBULL in their Best Wallet app – celebrate the link between Bitcoin and the Bitcoin memecoin BTC Bull. The final $BTCBULL airdrop at $250K rewards participants who’ve held their tokens throughout the project. We think the idea has real potential; our BTC Bull price prediction shows the token potentially reaching $0.006467 by the end of the year. It currently trades at $0.002525, so that would be an increase of 156%. Learn how to buy BTC Bull token , and check out the presale page . 2. Cat in a dogs world ($MEW) – May Boom Sends Solana Meme Coin up 62% Solana may not be mass-producing memecoins on pump.fun like it used to, but it can still pump out the memes if necessary. $MEW is a prime example. The memecoin launched in May of last year as a hot new crypto , rode the end-of-year wave to a high of $0.01288 in November, then crashed to $0.001824 in March 2025. And since then, it’s been on a roll. Over the past month, $MEW is up 62%. It’s rocking and rolling, likely also benefiting from Solana’s own rebound in recent weeks. There’s no real utility with $MEW – it’s a meme coin, pure and simple. But judging by price performance, it’s one of the best meme coins so far this year. Recent $MEW performance seems likely to continue as long as the market remains positive; with Bitcoin booming, that could be the case for a while. 3. Solaxy ($SOLX) – A Brave New World of Memecoins on Pioneering Solana Layer-2 With a month left in the presale, Solaxy ($SOLX) , the world’s first planned Solana Layer-2, has already raised $39.5M. That’s a huge amount of support for a token with big aspirations. The $SOLX roadmap calls for a token launch on Ethereum and other select chains (including Solana). Post-launch, those $SOLX tokens can be bridged to the Solaxy Layer-2 chain when it goes live. The tokenomics reserves significant portions for platform development and exchange listing, demonstrating a commitment to the long-term success of the project. In the meantime, $SOLX will be tradable on select DEXs and CEXs. The Solaxy blockchain aims to increase scalability, reduce congestion, and achieve smooth, low-cost transactions. It adds Solana’s strengths to Ethereum’s reliability and potential, with a multichain token and Layer-2 architecture. With the presale soon ending, learn how to buy Solaxy to avoid being left out. The token has huge potential; currently priced at $0.001732, our $SOLX price prediction shows the token could reach $0.032 by the end of 2025, a 1747% increase. Don’t forget to visit the presale page to learn more. Trump Joins Ranks of Memecoin Degens Is Trump trying to take advantage of his office and position? Or is he a crypto degen in disguise? He’s certainly hanging out with them more and more, regardless of who he annoys. By doing so, he’s giving tacit approval to memecoin mania. That bodes well for the memecoins on this list. Do your own research; all memecoins are volatile. But there’s certainly more potential than ever for the best memecoins to succeed.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/trump-sparks-anger-with-dinner-buy-best-meme-coins-instead/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Crypto News",cryptocompare
2025-05-23T10:40:16.000Z,"US Dollar Faces Crucial Headwinds: BofA Warns on Fiscal Policy & Currency Accords","BitcoinWorld US Dollar Faces Crucial Headwinds: BofA Warns on Fiscal Policy & Currency Accords The strength or weakness of the US dollar is a major force in the global financial system, impacting everything from commodity prices to international trade, and yes, even the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. When the world’s reserve currency faces challenges, investors across all asset classes pay attention. Bank of America (BofA) recently issued a notable warning, highlighting significant US dollar headwinds stemming from two key areas: US fiscal policy and evolving international currency accords. Understanding US Dollar Headwinds What exactly does it mean for a currency to face ‘headwinds’? In simple terms, it refers to factors or forces that are likely to impede its strength or cause it to depreciate against other currencies. BofA’s analysis suggests that structural issues within the US economy and shifts in the global financial landscape are creating persistent pressures against the dollar. These headwinds aren’t just short-term fluctuations. According to BofA, they represent more fundamental shifts that could influence the dollar’s trajectory over the medium to long term. This perspective is crucial for anyone involved in the forex market analysis or making international investment decisions. Fiscal Policy Impact on the US Dollar One of the primary drivers of the projected US dollar headwinds , according to BofA, is the current state and trajectory of US fiscal policy. Fiscal policy involves the government’s decisions about spending and taxation. When a government spends more than it takes in through taxes, it runs a budget deficit, which adds to the national debt. BofA points to several aspects of US fiscal policy contributing to dollar weakness: Large and Growing Deficits: Persistent large budget deficits can raise concerns about the government’s ability to manage its finances. This can erode confidence in the currency. Rising National Debt: As deficits accumulate, the national debt grows. A high and increasing debt level can be seen as a long-term liability, potentially leading to inflationary pressures if the central bank were ever pressured to monetize the debt. Inflationary Risks: While the link is complex, significant government spending, especially when not matched by production increases, can contribute to inflationary pressures. Inflation erodes the purchasing power of a currency, making it less attractive. The market’s perception of fiscal responsibility (or lack thereof) directly influences investor confidence in the dollar. If investors believe that deficits are unsustainable or will lead to inflation, they may seek safer or higher-yielding assets elsewhere, putting downward pressure on the dollar. The Role of Currency Accords and Global Shifts Beyond domestic fiscal issues, BofA also highlights the impact of evolving international dynamics, specifically mentioning currency agreements or accords. This refers to various ways countries are interacting regarding currency use and trade settlements. Several trends fall under this umbrella: Bilateral Currency Swaps: More countries are entering into agreements to trade directly in their own currencies, bypassing the need to use the US dollar as an intermediary. Dedollarization Efforts: Some nations and blocs are actively seeking to reduce their reliance on the US dollar for trade, reserves, and investments, often motivated by geopolitical factors or a desire for greater financial autonomy. Rise of Alternative Payment Systems: The development of non-dollar-based international payment systems offers alternatives to traditional dollar-centric mechanisms. Increased Use of Other Currencies: While the dollar remains dominant, there’s a gradual, albeit slow, increase in the use of other major currencies (like the Euro or Chinese Yuan) in international transactions and reserves. These shifts, collectively, represent a gradual erosion of the dollar’s unchallenged dominance in global finance. While it’s unlikely to be dethroned overnight, the increasing willingness and ability of countries to operate outside the dollar system create structural US dollar headwinds over time. BofA Forecast and Forex Market Analysis Putting these factors together, BofA’s outlook, or BofA forecast , suggests a less favorable environment for the US dollar compared to recent years. Their analysis likely incorporates how these fiscal and international dynamics interact with other factors like interest rate differentials, economic growth prospects, and geopolitical risks. For participants in the forex market analysis , BofA’s view implies that simply relying on traditional drivers like interest rate hikes might not be sufficient to guarantee dollar strength. The structural issues highlighted by BofA could act as persistent drags. A detailed BofA forecast would likely include specific price targets or ranges for major currency pairs (like EUR/USD, USD/JPY, etc.) based on their assessment of these headwinds. While specific numbers can change, the underlying message is a cautionary one for dollar bulls. Navigating Potential Challenges If BofA’s assessment of US dollar headwinds proves accurate, what are the potential implications and challenges? Inflation Concerns: Persistent deficits and potential debt issues could fuel long-term inflation expectations. Higher Borrowing Costs: If confidence in US debt wanes, the government might have to pay higher interest rates to borrow money. Shift in Global Power Dynamics: A weaker dollar could reflect and contribute to shifts in global economic and political influence. Impact on Asset Prices: A weaker dollar can make US exports cheaper but imports more expensive. It can also influence the flow of international capital and the relative attractiveness of different asset classes, including cryptocurrencies, which sometimes react inversely to dollar strength. Actionable Insights for Investors Considering the potential US dollar headwinds flagged by BofA, what steps might investors consider? It’s important to remember that this is one bank’s view, and market outcomes are never certain. However, incorporating this perspective into your investment thinking can be valuable. Diversification: Ensure your portfolio isn’t overly exposed to US dollar-denominated assets if you are concerned about its potential depreciation. Monitor Fiscal Policy: Keep an eye on US government spending, taxation, and debt levels. Changes in policy or market reaction to policy can be significant drivers. Watch Global Currency Trends: Pay attention to developments in international currency accords, the rise of alternative payment systems, and the use of other currencies in trade and reserves. Consider Forex Exposure: If you have international investments or expenses, understand your exposure to currency fluctuations and consider hedging strategies if appropriate. Assess Crypto’s Role: While crypto’s relationship with the dollar is complex, some view assets like Bitcoin as a potential hedge against traditional currency weakness or inflation, though this is a debated topic with significant risks. Conducting thorough forex market analysis and understanding the factors influencing major currencies like the dollar is vital for informed decision-making in the current global economic climate. Conclusion: BofA’s Cautionary Note Bank of America’s warning about US dollar headwinds from fiscal policy and currency accords serves as a crucial reminder that the dollar’s status is not immutable. While it remains the world’s dominant currency, structural domestic issues and evolving international dynamics are creating challenges. The BofA forecast suggests these factors warrant careful consideration by anyone with exposure to the dollar or the global financial markets. Staying informed about these macro trends is essential for navigating the complexities of the forex market analysis and making sound investment choices in an increasingly interconnected world.

2025-05-23T10:36:46.000Z,"Why XRP Might Be the Next Crypto to Surge?","The post Why XRP Might Be the Next Crypto to Surge? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP price is currently trading around $2.45, maintaining a steady pace while Bitcoin consolidates under $111K . But beneath this calm surface, a powerful wave might be building for XRP, thanks to Ripple’s recently uncovered acquisition of Hidden Road , a prime brokerage registered with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC), which processes a staggering $11 trillion in daily transactions. Ripple’s Silent Power Play Though not widely publicized by Ripple, the Hidden Road acquisition has sent ripples through the XRP community. FICC’s Government Securities Division (GSD) is one of the world’s largest financial clearinghouses. As per a community member , if Ripple integrates any part of this $11T volume through its infrastructure and be it the XRP Ledger (XRPL), the RLUSD stablecoin, or XRP itself, the price implications could be game-changing. Interestingly, this setup could work like magic for XRP. While RLUSD, Ripple’s new stablecoin, will manage USD settlements, XRP will still be used to pay transaction fees, and those fees are burned. This means that even if XRP isn’t the primary asset for settlement, its supply will gradually shrink, potentially increasing its value over time as adoption grows. How RLUSD and XRPL Fit In Ripple plans to use RLUSD for USD settlements, but XRP remains crucial. Each transaction burns a tiny amount of XRP, and while the daily burn (even at high adoption) may be negligible, it’s the usage that matters. If institutions adopt XRPL for even 1% of FICC’s daily volume, XRP’s utility and liquidity demand could spike, opening the door for major price appreciation. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Flashes Bullish Signal After 200 Days, Price Targets $3.33 , A $20 XRP? Here’s the Case Despite a 58 billion circulating supply, analysts argue XRP could reach $10–$20 by 2030 if network effects take hold. Just as Bitcoin’s ETF-fueled rally pushed it above $100K, XRP could see a similar surge if it becomes a standard bridge currency in institutional finance. However, regulatory uncertainty and macroeconomic shifts remain as potential hurdles. What happens when just a fraction of that $10B daily volume starts settling through XRP? Demand skyrockets. These aren't retail traders—these are hedge funds and market makers who need XRP to power their operations. And they'll be buying lots of it. 3/19 — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) April 8, 2025 Crypto analyst Jake Claver highlighted massive potential for XRP adoption, stating that if even a fraction of the $10B daily volume starts settling through XRP, demand could surge. In short, Ripple’s Hidden Road connection is real, and the $11T opportunity is massive. But XRP needs large-scale adoption and infrastructure usage to turn that into a $20 reality. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Analysts suggest XRP could reach $10-$20 by 2030 if it achieves widespread network effects and becomes a standard bridge currency in institutional finance. What factors could drive XRP’s price appreciation? Large-scale institutional adoption of XRPL, increased XRP utility for transaction fees (burning supply), and its role as a bridge currency could drive price. What role will RLUSD play in this integration? Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, will manage USD settlements, while XRP will be used for transaction fees, contributing to XRP’s gradual supply reduction.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-xrp-might-be-the-next-crypto-to-surge/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|WALLET|XRP","News|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

This move has brought high expectations for the altcoin market, including XRP, which has yet to regain its all-time high of $3.84. Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto), a prominent influencer on X, asked his followers: “You wake up and the #XRP price is $20. What will you do?” You wake up and the #XRP price is $20. What will you do? — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) May 21, 2025 Such a move would mark a massive shift in market valuation and investor sentiment. The post quickly gained traction among the XRP army, with many sharing their optimism for the asset and their potential first actions after seeing such a price move. XRP Army Shares Their Reactions Responses from the XRP community varied, though many were grounded in long-term conviction. Several users emphasized holding their positions rather than cashing out. One simply stated that he would “just open a beer and HOLD,” while another commented , “Keep holding, lol, why wouldn’t I?” indicating he views XRP as a long-term asset with more room for growth. Experts have constantly advocated for this strategy, with one well-known CEO referring to selling XRP as throwing a winning lottery ticket away . XRP has shown remarkable growth over the years, and those who hold for the long term always benefit the most. Others took a more strategic stance. One user stated that he would “sell 30k XRP and take a 1-month vacation,” suggesting a readiness to take profits while still maintaining a substantial stake. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 High Expectations for XRP Some community members see the $20 as too little to sell. XRP Avenger, a well-respected community member, revealed in early 2024 that while 98% of holders will sell between $10 and $50, he’s waiting for the asset to cross $100 before selling . One commenter took this belief further, stating that he would applaud the asset’s growth if it reaches $20, and then continue waiting until it climbs to $1,000. These reactions highlight high expectations within certain parts of the community, which have long believed XRP is undervalued. While the influencer’s question was speculative, the responses show people’s faith in the asset, varying plans, and strategies. Some are ready to take profits, others remain committed to holding indefinitely. XRP is currently trading at $2.46. While some dismiss the idea of a climb to $20, experts have set targets at above $1,000 for the digital asset, and its massive potential in the global financial system could help it achieve these goals.

Easing import tariff tensions and $329M in spot Bitcoin ETF inflows fueled BTC’s recent surge. Institutional interest and bullish options market activity support Bitcoin’s structurally strong rally. Bitcoin (BTC) charged to a new all-time high (ATH), breaking above $111,500 during Asian trading hours earlier today. This impressive climb marked a sudden and sharp rebound for the leading cryptocurrency after it initially dipped along with other risk assets. Bitcoin first hit around $109,600 when U.S. equity markets opened but then saw a brief downturn following news of a weak $16 billion 20-year U.S. Treasury auction. Despite that momentary pullback, Bitcoin mounted a swift V-shaped price recovery. Analysts are describing this current upward move as a “structurally stronger rally,” driven by growing institutional investor interest and positive shifts in the regulatory shifts.

2025-05-23T10:28:19.000Z,"Why Is Crypto Up Today? – May 23, 2025","The rally remains strong. All top 10 coins and nearly all 100 coins per market cap are still green, some recording double-digit increases. Per analysts, the main drivers are spot demand, growing institutional participation, and a more productive regulatory stance. At the same time, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has decreased by 1.7% to $3.63 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $153 billion. TLDR: BTC trades sideways but may be preparing to test new highs; The rally is driven almost entirely by spot demand; Bitcoin showcases strong fundamentals, defying strong geopolitical and other forces; New ATHs are the ‘beginning of a new era for the original cryptocurrency’; Spot Bitcoin ETFs see a net inflow of $934.74 million; Crypto market rally remains sustainable. Crypto Winners & Losers At the time of writing, nearly all top 10 coins per market capitalization have appreciated over the past day. Bitcoin (BTC) is the only coin at the moment with an unchanged price, trading at $110,594. Compared to the all-time high of $111,814, which it hit yesterday, BTC is now down by 1.1%. Ethereum (ETH) appreciated 1.9%, now changing hands at $2,666. Its daily high is $2,720. The category’s best performer, for the third day in a row, is Cardano (ADA) . It’s up 3.3% to $0.8145. Of the top 100 coins, seven are red today. Sui (SUI) decreased the most: 5.1% to the price of $3.85. On the other hand, Worldcoin (WLD) is the category’s best performer, having appreciated 22.7% to $1.56. On 21 May, World Foundation announced that it raised $135 million from Andreessen Horowitz and Bain Capital Crypto . It also noted that World now has more than 26 million users across 160 countries, while 12.5 million people have an Orb-verified World ID. Furthermore, Apple designer Jony Ive teamed up with World co-founder Sam Altman at OpenAI . Sam & Jony introduce io pic.twitter.com/ej5K59kJq3 — OpenAI (@OpenAI) May 21, 2025 Meanwhile, Gadi Chait, Head of Investment at Xapo Bank , commented that, despite a backdrop of historic geopolitical uncertainty, Bitcoin’s latest rally is driven “almost entirely by spot demand.” It’s further supported by “the first meaningful alignment of policy tailwinds in years—a bipartisan push around FIT21 in Washington, HM Treasury’s near-final UK framework, a 90-day US–China tariff pause and softer US inflation data—all of which have restored breathing space for allocators.” Finally, institutional uptake shows that digital assets have moved from speculative niche to integral portfolio tool, Chait says. ‘Beginning of a New Era for the Original Cryptocurrency’ Seamus Rocca, CEO of Xapo Bank , argues that BTC’s latest ATH is “no surprise to those who understand its long-term fundamentals.” The momentum showcases the assets’ growing maturity, institutional participation, a more constructive regulatory outlook, and greater understanding of the asset among governments. “But importantly, it is not Bitcoin’s defining moment; it is one of many to come.” Rocca stresses that we are still in the early stages of Bitcoin’s broader adoption. The asset is highly resilient. It has the ability to deliver consistent upward performance despite cycles of macro uncertainty and volatility in traditional markets, he says. “Events that once might have sparked fear and uncertainty, like the recent Coinbase cyber-attack or Moody’s downgrade of the US credit rating, have been absorbed by the market with little disruption. These moments alone signal how far Bitcoin has matured,” Rocca writes. It is “steadily cementing its role as a cornerstone of the future financial system.” Crypto Heatmap Today BTC holds strong at $111K, ETH climbs near $2.7K, and SOL gains momentum!

Bitcoin DeFi TVL has more than doubled in just over a month, tracking the price trajectory. Per DeFiLlama, it now stands at $6.811 billion. Source: DeFiLlama Moreover, he says that BTC’s ATH is more than a price milestone. Rather, it’s “the beginning of a new era for the original cryptocurrency.” Price speculations are possible, but precise predictions are not. “What we can say with certainty is that Bitcoin is maturing and entering a phase defined by institutional adoption, clearer regulation, and, critically, rapid technological progress,” Harz says. “We’re seeing mainstream adoption and technical innovation on a collision course — and the result will reshape the crypto landscape.” Levels & Events to Watch Next After hitting a local high of $111,807, BTC saw a pullback to $110,594. Overall, it’s mostly been trading between $110,400 and $111,300. Key resistance levels are $112,000, followed by a strong psychological level of $115,000 – $120,000, after which the next breakthrough would be $125,000. Support levels to keep an eye on are $107,000, then $100,000, and the critical level of $95,000. Unity Wallet’s Toledano, argues that while Bitcoin’s “integration into diverse portfolios, from state retirement systems to sovereign wealth funds, reflects its growing legitimacy, caution is always warranted.” Its inherent volatility remains a significant concern. Its price is susceptible to rapid fluctuations due to market sentiment, regulatory changes, and macroeconomic shifts, he says. Meanwhile, the Fear and Greed Index has made another jump deeper into the green zone, from 73 to 76 in a day, signaling high confidence and willingness to take risks. Source: CoinMarketCap Moreover, in a seventh consecutive day of inflows, spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen a net inflow of a whopping $934.74 million . Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded $110.54 in net inflows, for a fifth day of positive flows. Potential Positive and Negative Effects Meanwhile, there have been quite a few positive news stories over the past day across the world, with the crypto market benefiting. For example, on the regulatory side, the US CFTC outgoing commissioner Summer Mersinger suggested that the agency would approve crypto perpetual futures “very soon.” She also said that its incoming chairman “has a great voice for the crypto industry.” Also, two US Congressmen reintroduced the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act (BRCA) to prevent crypto service providers from being classified as money transmitters. Tom Emmer and Ritchie Torres have reintroduced key legislation that would prevent crypto developers from being classed as money transmitters. #RitchieTorres #TomEmmer https://t.co/tvHdoVU1gM — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 22, 2025 On the adoption side, some of the largest US banks, including JPMorgan Chase , Bank of America , Citigroup , and Wells Fargo , are reportedly exploring a potential partnership to issue a shared stablecoin. However, there are some potentially negative news. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed its decision on the Solana ETF proposals from Bitwise and 21Shares until June. Extensions may signal to investors skepticism and an unfavorable view of the industry. They’re also affecting product schedules. Moreover, an even more pressing issue is US President Donald Trump’s direct involvement in and promotion of his TRUMP meme coin, rewarding its top investors. Critics are warning that this enables anonymous investors to buy access to the president. Senator Chris Murphy said Trump’s dinner for top investors was “essentially opening a channel for bribery.” Democrats should stand together and use our power to fix the GENIUS Act before the vote tomorrow. There is no excuse to facilitate Trump's crypto corruption. pic.twitter.com/hZ3dplcZAc — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) May 8, 2025 Also, Ranking Member of the House Financial Services Committee Maxine Waters introduced a new bill targeting corruption in the crypto sector. It would prohibit elected officials from owning “a proportion of a digital asset that would allow the individual to unilaterally make changes to the digital asset.” BREAKING RM @RepMaxineWaters & Cmte Democrats introduce H.R. 3573, the “Stop Trading, Retention, and Unfair Market Payoffs in Crypto Act of 2025,” landmark legislation that will put an end to Trump’s crypto corruption & protect America’s investors. | https://t.co/sHZfMZYx0A pic.twitter.com/ZbKK9hxhE3 — House Committee on Financial Services – Democrats (@USHouseFSC) May 22, 2025 These Trump’s moves may have a negative cascading effect on the crypto market, so participants should keep a critical eye on it. Quick FAQ Why did crypto move against stocks today? The crypto market continues its rally, but the stock market is seeing a mixed performance, mostly falling or going flat. The S&P 500 is down 0.044%, the Nasdaq-100 is up 0.15%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average saw a smaller decrease of 0.0032%. As factors, analysts are primarily noting US Treasury yields declining from recent highs following the passage of the tax and spending bill in that country. Is this rally sustainable? The rally is going strong for now, upheld by the ETF inflow surges and generally favorable regulatory developments. Both of these factors can quickly shift, though. Yet analysts expect to see only short-term corrections for now.

Yet, analysts are predicting that the expiration of over 25,000 BTC options contracts on the derivatives market today, a notional value of approximately $2.81 billion, could drag the top coin by market cap down to the recently breached all-time high level. According to data from Greeks.Live, the put/call ratio for this expiration stood at 1.22, a slightly bearish short-term sentiment among traders. The max pain point, or the price at which option holders would incur the most losses, sits well below current levels at $104,000. 【5月23日期权交割数据】 2.5万张BTC期权到期，Put Call Ratio为1.22，最大痛点104000美元，名义价值28.1亿美元。 20.2万张ETH期权到期，Put Call Ratio为1.26，最大痛点2450美元，名义价值5.7亿美元。… pic.twitter.com/X0qix0UeMP — Adam@Greeks.live (@BTC__options) May 23, 2025 Bitcoin is now trading near $110,900, above both max pain and technical resistance zones. The market is showing signs of bull tailwinds, beyond short-term hedging strategies. Moreover, the expiration event has not triggered notable market volatility, thanks to low relative exposure and long-term conviction across investors of all sizes. Institutional holdings mull BTC price growth in the coming months May 23’s expiry involved a notable volume of contracts , but it only accounted for 7.63% of total BTC open interest, meaning the broader derivatives market is largely unaffected. Most of the open interest is concentrated in later expiries, with June 27 accounting for 30.38% and May 30 holding 26.03%. Institutional traders could be looking at taking more positions and increasing their market participation in June. “The low exposure to today’s expiry likely capped potential volatility. Instead, traders are building exposure toward more pivotal dates, with open interest and implied volatility rising around June’s contracts,” explained derivatives analyst Peter Yan of AlphaOptions. The overall put/call ratio for all BTC options, standing at 0.61, places Bitcoin at a longer-term bullish tilt. High-strike call options such as the $200,000 and $300,000 levels for June are among the most crowded, with $420 million and $620 million in notional value, respectively. More accumulation across wallet sizes Data from Glassnode shows Bitcoin’s Accumulation Trend Score hit 1.0, which means the market is under sustained buying pressure from both ends, whales and small crypto holders. Glassnode analysts observed that wallets holding over 10,000 BTC started the accumulation wave earlier in May when BTC started exhibiting signs of a positive price correction north of $95,000. “It’s similar to the behavior we saw back in January, right before Bitcoin’s last parabolic leg,” Glassnode noted in a research post. “What’s different this time is that accumulation is occurring at all-time highs, not during a dip. That’s historically very rare.” If Bitcoin sustains its footing above $110,000 and breaks through the $112,000 resistance, the path toward new highs remains wide open. That said, strong spot buying, coupled with aggressive accumulation, favors the bulls. Ethereum lags behind as options skew bearish Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) has struggled to keep up with Bitcoin’s momentum. 202,000 ETH options are also expiring today, representing over $543 million in notional value. Per data from analytics platform Deribit, the market is moving cautiously towards buying ETH, with a higher put/call ratio of 1.26 and a max pain point at $2,450, well below its current spot price of $2,669. Expiring Ethereum options. Source: Deribit Up 2.6% in the last week, Ether is testing the upper boundary of a rising wedge pattern near $2,680. The pattern is deemed as a bearish reversal signal when it appears after an extended uptrend, but long-term holders are hoping for a trend reversal that could push the price back up to $3,000.

The financial world is splitting between those who wait for permission and those who mint their own destiny. The last crypto cycle was about memecoins, degenerate yields, and wild volatility. Where does crypto go from here? It has to be about stability, liquidity, and real-world utility. As the world enters a phase of economic instability and AI automation, on-chain dollars are going to become the backbone of commerce, coordination, and capital flows. You might also like: Beyond the peg: Synthetic dollars are reshaping stablecoins | Opinion In times of global economic uncertainty, the U.S. dollar remains the world’s reserve asset. But now, people want access to dollars without banks. Stablecoins like USD Coin ( USDC ) and Tether ( USDT ) have become the de facto savings and spending tools in emerging markets and crisis zones. We’ve entered a new era of money, where the dollar isn’t just printed by the Fed but minted on-chain, powered by borderless and frictionless infrastructure. Stablecoins like USDC, USDT, PayPal USD ( PYUSD ), and now yield-bearing alternatives like Ethena USDe ( USDE ) are processing billions daily, not as speculative assets but as functional currency. In places like Nigeria, they’re already replacing failing local money. Nigerian web3 startups have raised over $130m to date as stablecoin use is on the rise. Argentinians are ditching pesos for USDT and USDC at record rates as they’re facing inflation at 200%. When fiat currencies become unstable, as is the case with hyperinflation, for example, people look for alternatives. Bitcoin was an alternative. However, digital dollars or stablecoins are now the primary choice. The signs are all there that the dollar is migrating on-chain, and the institutions that don’t adapt will be left behind. Expanded support for PYUSD by a $70 billion fintech giant PayPal was a big validation that stablecoins are here to stay, with millions of users now able to move dollars on-chain without even realizing it. On regulatory advancement, the U.S. Congress is proceeding with the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act. The UK and EU are also finalizing their own frameworks. Base, Solana and Celo are all aggressively deploying USDC across new chains because they understand that stablecoins are the bridges between TradFi and DeFi. The more chains they’re on, the more unstoppable they become. Ignore these trends, and you’re ignoring the financial infrastructure of the next decade. The next wave of adoption won’t just come from humans and platforms. AI agents will need programmable money that doesn’t fluctuate wildly. Human traders might chase speculative swings, but AI operates on cold, hard logic. It prioritizes efficiency, minimizes risk, and demands certainty in its inputs, especially when those inputs are money. Traditional fiat money has several limitations that make it prohibitive as a currency of settlement, including physical logistics, lack of interoperability, and centralization. Stablecoins solve this problem because of their on-chain existence. Blockchains are immutable, composable, and decentralized. Take USDC as an example. Once Circle mints USDC on the blockchain, its existence or value cannot be tampered with. It is also not held by institutions bound by borders; it is easily moved across wallets globally. These inherent traits of stablecoins make them ideal for a future where numerous agents conduct high-speed transactions with each other. This is why stablecoins will become the backbone of AI-driven finance. An autonomous supply-chain agent won’t hedge against Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) 5% daily swings, it needs a currency as stable as its code. A decentralized trading bot can’t afford slippage from erratic fiat settlement times, but requires real-time, on-chain verifiability. For businesses, it’s time to start considering the adoption of stablecoins for payments. As the popularity of blockchains and Bitcoin increases, so does the adoption of stablecoins. Institutions and consumers are increasingly becoming aware of stablecoins as a more efficient and convenient alternative to fiat, faster than ever. The dollar is going on-chain because it has to. Hyperinflation, capital controls, and inefficient payment rails are breaking the old system. Stablecoins are the patch, and eventually, the upgrade.

2025-05-23T10:21:50.000Z,"Here’s how scammers are targeting Ledger wallet users to steal crypto on macOS","Ledger wallet users are being targeted by a sophisticated phishing campaign involving fake Ledger Live apps on macOS. According to a report from cybersecurity firm Moonlock Lab, attackers are deploying malware that replaces the legitimate Ledger Live application with a lookalike designed to steal users’ 24-word recovery phrases and, in some cases, crypto assets. Once entered, these phrases are transmitted to attacker-controlled servers, enabling them to instantly drain victims’ cryptocurrency wallets. How does it happen? The campaign relies on a variant of the Atomic macOS Stealer, which Moonlock said has been found on over 2,800 compromised websites. Atomic Stealer, also known as AMOS (Atomic macOS Stealer), is a malware strain designed to infect macOS systems and steal sensitive user information. First observed in early 2023, it quickly gained traction on underground forums due to its malware-as-a-service (MaaS) model, where cybercriminals can rent it and deploy attacks without technical expertise. Once a user downloads the malware, it not only collects passwords, notes, and wallet data but also swaps the real Ledger Live app with a clone. The fake app then triggers a deceptive alert about “suspicious activity,” prompting the user to enter their seed phrase to supposedly secure their wallet. Initially, Moonlock noted, the cloned app was used only to steal sensitive user data, but attackers have since “learned to steal seed phrases and empty the wallets of their victims.” Moonlock researchers have tracked at least four ongoing campaigns using this method and warned that these threat actors are “only getting smarter.” Moonlock has been tracking the malware campaign since August and has so far identified at least four active operations targeting Ledger users. Adding to the concern, researchers also found dark web forums increasingly advertising malware with “anti-Ledger” capabilities, though in one case, the advertised phishing features weren’t yet fully operational. These could still be in development or “forthcoming in future updates,” the researchers speculated. “This isn’t just a theft. It’s a high-stakes effort to outsmart one of the most trusted tools in the crypto world. And the thieves are not backing down,” Moonlock researchers said. Other attack vectors targeting Ledger users Over the past year, Ledger users have faced a range of phishing tactics. In one Reddit post from January 2024, a victim described how their computer was silently compromised, leading to $15,000 worth of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, and Litecoin being stolen after entering their seed phrase into what they believed was a factory reset prompt in Ledger Live. Attackers have also exploited community channels. On May 11, 2025, a moderator account in Ledger’s official Discord server was compromised. The attacker used elevated permissions to mute warnings from legitimate users and deployed a bot that posted links to a phishing site mimicking a Ledger verification page. Meanwhile, in late April, scammers sent physical letters to users impersonating official Ledger communication. These letters included company branding, a reference number, and a QR code directing recipients to enter their seed phrase for a supposed “critical security update.” How to stay safe? Moonlock advised users to avoid entering their 24-word recovery phrase into any app, website, or form, regardless of how legitimate it appeared. Prompts warning of a “critical error” or requesting wallet verification were almost always signs of a scam. The firm also urged users to download Ledger Live exclusively from official sources and warned that no genuine Ledger service would ever ask for a recovery phrase under any circumstances.

2025-05-23T10:20:22.000Z,"Pat Toomey: Major Crypto Regulation Bill Nearing Senate Vote","The post Pat Toomey: Major Crypto Regulation Bill Nearing Senate Vote appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Big changes might be coming to the U.S. crypto scene. In a recent interview on Bloomberg TV, former U.S. Senator Pat Toomey, now part of Coinbase’s Global Advisory Council, shared that a major crypto regulation bill is close to being passed in the Senate. If approved, it could reshape how digital assets are governed in the U.S., and potentially boost innovation across the industry. The U.S. Can’t Afford to Fall Behind, Toomey Warns Toomey made it clear: without clear and supportive regulations, the U.S. could lose its lead in the global digital currency race. “There’s no guarantee we’ll dominate the space unless we pass sensible legislation,” he said. He explained that the bill aims to lay the groundwork for crypto innovators to build new products that make payments and money transfers faster and easier for everyday users. Stablecoin Standards Could Put the U.S. Back in the Lead A major part of the bill focuses on stablecoins. Toomey pointed out that the new framework is designed to meet global standards, giving the U.S. a chance to take the lead in stablecoin development. He also noted that during the Biden administration, the U.S. fell behind in crypto policy. But that’s changing, as the current administration is placing more focus on digital assets and their role in the future of finance. Regulation That Protects Users and Encourages Growth Addressing concerns about past crypto scandals, Toomey highlighted that the bill includes strong consumer protection measures. These are aimed at reducing the risk of bankruptcy and building more trust in the system. Bitcoin’s recent jump past $110,000 is partly tied to excitement around stablecoin regulation. With the House already passing related economic bills, crypto supporters are now watching closely as the Senate prepares to vote. Will the Credit Card Competition Act Be Attached? There’s been talk that the Credit Card Competition Act might be linked to the crypto bill, but Toomey didn’t hold back in his response. “That would be a huge mistake,” he said, making it clear that the credit card issue is unrelated and could create unnecessary conflict. While the crypto bill has strong bipartisan support, the credit card act is more controversial and could derail the progress. What This Means for the Future of Crypto in the U.S. Toomey believes this bill could be a turning point for the U.S. in the global race for crypto adoption. It’s designed to support innovation, protect consumers, and give the country a clear and competitive edge in digital finance. As the Senate gets closer to a final decision, the crypto world is waiting – and hoping – for a green light that could open the door to the next wave of growth.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/pat-toomey-major-crypto-regulation-bill-nearing-senate-vote/,"BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION","News",cryptocompare
2025-05-23T10:20:10.000Z,"Bitcoin Alert: Galaxy Digital Deposits Significant BTC to Binance","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Alert: Galaxy Digital Deposits Significant BTC to Binance Big moves in the crypto world often start with whispers, but when large institutions like Galaxy Digital are involved, those whispers can quickly turn into significant market observations. Recently, on-chain data flagged a notable event: a wallet associated with Galaxy Digital made substantial deposits of Bitcoin (BTC) onto the Binance exchange. This isn’t just another small transaction; we’re talking about a considerable amount of BTC changing hands, sparking discussions across the crypto community. What Happened with the Galaxy Digital BTC Transfer? Let’s break down the specifics of this intriguing event. Over a span of roughly six hours, a crypto wallet identified as being linked to Galaxy Digital initiated multiple transfers, ultimately depositing a total of 450 BTC onto the Binance platform. The value of these transfers, at the time they occurred, amounted to approximately $50.08 million. The movement wasn’t a single lump sum. It appears to have been staggered, with one specific transfer of 100 BTC (valued at around $11.08 million) happening within the two hours leading up to the initial report. This pattern of staggered transfers isn’t uncommon for large entities, potentially used to manage execution risk or for specific trading strategies. Here’s a simplified look at the movement: Source Wallet: Linked to Galaxy Digital Destination: Binance Exchange Total BTC Transferred: 450 BTC Approximate Total Value: $50.08 million (at time of transfers) Timeframe: Within a six-hour window Recent Transfer Highlight: 100 BTC ($11.08 million) two hours prior to initial report Understanding the flow of these large BTC transfers is crucial for anyone trying to gauge institutional sentiment and potential market activity. Who is Galaxy Digital and Why Does Their Activity Matter? For those new to the institutional side of crypto, Galaxy Digital is a prominent player. Founded by Michael Novogratz, it’s a financial services and investment management company focused on the digital asset, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology sectors. Unlike individual traders, institutions like Galaxy Digital operate with significant capital and often execute strategies that can influence market dynamics. Their activities matter for several key reasons: Market Influence: Large players moving large amounts of Bitcoin can potentially signal upcoming trading activity, whether buying or selling. Institutional Sentiment: Their actions can be seen as a proxy for broader institutional crypto interest and confidence in the market. Liquidity Provision: Deposits to exchanges can increase liquidity, making it easier for others to trade large volumes. Validation: Active participation from established financial firms lends credibility to the digital asset space. When a firm of Galaxy Digital’s stature makes a substantial BTC transfer to a major exchange like Binance , it catches the eye of analysts and traders alike, prompting speculation about the underlying reasons. Why Would an Institution Transfer 450 BTC to an Exchange? This is the million-dollar question (or in this case, the fifty-million-dollar question). While we can’t know the exact reason without direct confirmation from Galaxy Digital, there are several common explanations for large institutional deposits to exchanges: Potential Reasons for the BTC Transfer: Preparing to Sell: The most common assumption is that assets are moved to an exchange to be sold, either on the spot market or through over-the-counter (OTC) deals facilitated by the exchange. A sale of 450 BTC could be for profit-taking, portfolio rebalancing, or managing risk. Increasing Trading Capital: Galaxy Digital might be preparing to engage in active trading strategies on Binance, requiring Bitcoin to be readily available on the platform. This could involve hedging, arbitrage, or directional trading. Providing Liquidity: As a financial services firm, Galaxy Digital might be involved in market-making activities, requiring them to have assets on exchanges to facilitate trades for clients or their own operations. Collateralization: The BTC could be used as collateral for derivatives trading or lending activities available on the exchange. Internal Rebalancing: The transfer might simply be part of Galaxy Digital’s internal asset management, moving funds between cold storage, hot wallets, and exchange accounts for operational efficiency or security protocols. OTC Deals: While OTC deals often happen off-exchange, sometimes exchange infrastructure is used to settle or facilitate large block trades. The BTC could be destined for a specific buyer via a pre-arranged deal. Without official commentary, the precise motive behind this specific Galaxy Digital BTC transfer remains speculative, but these are the most likely scenarios considered by market watchers. What Does This Significant BTC Transfer Mean for the Bitcoin Market? Large institutional movements like this BTC transfer from Galaxy Digital to Binance are closely monitored because they can potentially impact market dynamics. Here’s how: Potential Market Implications: Increased Selling Pressure (Potential): If the intention is to sell, adding 450 BTC to the available supply on an exchange could, in theory, contribute to selling pressure, especially if executed quickly or during low liquidity periods. Increased Liquidity (Benefit): Conversely, having more Bitcoin on an exchange increases the overall liquidity, making it easier for both large and small participants to execute trades without significant price slippage. This is generally a positive for market health. Signaling Institutional Activity: The move itself confirms that institutions like Galaxy Digital remain active participants in the Bitcoin market, using major exchanges for their operations. This reinforces the narrative of growing institutional crypto adoption. Market Confidence Check: Depending on subsequent price action, the market’s reaction to such large deposits can provide clues about overall sentiment. Does the market absorb the potential selling pressure easily, or does it cause a notable dip? It’s important to note that a deposit doesn’t automatically mean an immediate sale. The funds could sit on the exchange for a while before any action is taken, or they could be used for non-selling purposes like collateral or trading capital for other assets. Tracking the Whales: The Power of On-Chain Data How do we even know about these movements? This is where on-chain analytics comes in. The transparent nature of public blockchains like Bitcoin allows anyone to track transactions, provided they can identify the wallets involved. Firms specializing in on-chain data analysis often link specific addresses to known entities like exchanges, institutions, or large investors (often called ‘whales’). Tracking large BTC transfers offers valuable insights: Transparency: Unlike traditional finance where large OTC deals are opaque, blockchain provides a level of transparency regarding asset movement. Early Signals: Large movements onto exchanges can sometimes precede significant price volatility, offering potential early signals to traders. Understanding Behavior: Analyzing patterns of deposits and withdrawals by known entities helps in understanding institutional behavior and strategies. Market Health: Tracking flows in and out of exchanges can give a sense of overall market sentiment and liquidity. Tools and platforms exist that monitor these large transactions, alerting users when significant amounts of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies are moved, especially to or from exchanges. This is how the Galaxy Digital deposit to Binance was initially flagged. Challenges and Considerations When Interpreting Large Transfers While tracking large BTC transfers is insightful, it’s not without its challenges and requires careful interpretation: Challenges: Ambiguity of Intent: As discussed, a deposit doesn’t definitively signal a sale. The reason behind the transfer is often not publicly disclosed. Wallet Identification: Linking specific wallets to institutions requires sophisticated analysis and is not always 100% accurate or up-to-date. OTC Deals: Many large institutional trades happen OTC and don’t necessarily involve significant movements onto public exchange order books before execution. Market Noise: One large transfer, while notable, is just one data point in a vast global market influenced by numerous factors. Security & Privacy: While transparent, identifying the ultimate beneficial owner of a wallet can still be difficult, raising privacy considerations. Therefore, while the Galaxy Digital deposit to Binance is a significant event to note, it should be considered alongside other market indicators and news. Historical Context: Other Notable Institutional Moves This isn’t the first time we’ve seen significant BTC transfers involving large institutions. Over the years, various ‘whale’ movements, including those linked to institutional players, venture funds, and even early miners, have been observed and analyzed. These movements often correlate with periods of increased volatility or shifts in market sentiment. For example, large withdrawals of Bitcoin from exchanges are often interpreted as a bullish signal, suggesting investors are moving assets into cold storage for long-term holding rather than keeping them on exchanges for immediate trading or selling. Conversely, large deposits like the one from Galaxy Digital to Binance are often viewed with caution, as they could indicate potential selling pressure. Understanding this historical context helps put the current Galaxy Digital move into perspective as part of the ongoing dance between large holders and the public markets. Conclusion: Watching the Aftermath of the Galaxy Digital BTC Transfer The recent deposit of 450 Bitcoin from a wallet linked to Galaxy Digital onto the Binance exchange is a notable event in the crypto space. Valued at over $50 million, this BTC transfer highlights the continued active participation of major financial institutions in the digital asset market. While the exact reasons for the transfer remain unconfirmed, likely scenarios include preparing for trading, increasing liquidity, or facilitating an OTC deal. This event underscores the value of on-chain data in providing transparency into the movements of large players. While a deposit doesn’t guarantee a sale, it increases the potential for significant trading activity on Binance . Market participants will be closely watching to see how these funds are utilized and whether this move has any discernible impact on Bitcoin ‘s price action in the short term. Ultimately, this move by Galaxy Digital serves as another piece of the puzzle in understanding the evolving landscape of institutional crypto adoption and its influence on the broader market.

2025-05-23T10:18:15.000Z,"Bybit’s Shunyet on Bitcoin’s ATH: ‘$125K Is Within Reach’ in Q2","BitcoinWorld Bybit’s Shunyet on Bitcoin’s ATH: ‘$125K Is Within Reach’ in Q2 Dubai, United Arab Emirates, May 23rd, 2025, Chainwire Bybit , the world’s second-largest crypto exchange by trading volume, today shared insights from its Head of Derivatives, Shunyet Jan, following Bitcoin’s surge to a new all-time high. Shunyet attributes the historic rally to a powerful alignment of market catalysts and macroeconomic shifts, and projects continued upside if current conditions hold. “Bitcoin’s climb to this all-time high underscores a transformative moment in the evolution of global finance,” said Shunyet. “We’re seeing a unique convergence of factors—regulatory clarity, institutional inflows, and macroeconomic shifts—that are accelerating mainstream adoption.” Shunyet identifies three core drivers behind Bitcoin’s rally: Regulatory Clarity on Stablecoins: “The emergence of comprehensive legislation—such as the GENIUS Act—is establishing clearer guardrails for stablecoins. This fosters greater institutional confidence and reinforces the foundational infrastructure needed for broader crypto adoption.” Sustained Spot ETF Inflows: “Robust and consistent capital inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs signal that institutional investors are embracing Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. These vehicles offer regulated access points, unlocking new sources of liquidity and long-term demand.” Weaker US Dollar and Inverse Correlation: “Bitcoin’s global nature makes it particularly responsive to macro trends. With the US dollar weakening, Bitcoin has benefited as an alternative store of value, further cementing its role as digital gold.” While Bitcoin leads the current rally, Shunyet notes a measured outlook for the broader crypto market: “Ethereum and other large-cap digital assets are likely to benefit from Bitcoin’s momentum,” Shunyet added. “However, high interest rates and lingering macroeconomic uncertainty may limit upside potential for smaller altcoins in the near term.” Looking ahead, Shunyet offered a bold projection: “If current trends continue, our analysis suggests Bitcoin could reach $125,000 by the end of Q2. We remain bullish on Bitcoin’s role in shaping the future of finance.” Bybit continues to provide a trusted, high-performance platform for both retail and institutional participants, enabling access to cutting-edge trading tools and a deep, liquid market. #Bybit / #TheCryptoArk About Bybit Bybit is the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, serving a global community of over 70 million users.

2025-05-23T10:17:39.000Z,"H100 Group Becomes Sweden’s First Publicly Listed Bitcoin Treasury Firm","Swedish health technology innovator H100 Group AB announced Thursday that it has acquired 4.39 BTC, becoming the first publicly listed Bitcoin treasury firm in the nation. https://twitter.com/H100Group/status/1925506932980228557 “This marks the beginning of a long-term strategy to align our balance sheet with the values of sovereignty, resilience, and digital-first innovation,” the company wrote in a post on X. The Stockholm-based company, renowned for its AI-powered healthcare automation solutions, bought Bitcoin worth 5 million NOK (about $475,000) as part of its “long-term” Bitcoin Treasury Strategy. The company has strategically allocated excess liquidity to strengthen its financial position, an official release noted. “By adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset, H100 becomes one of the first public health infrastructure companies in Europe to do so.” H100 Plans to keep Stacking BTC H100 CEO Sander Andersen told Cryptonews over email that the acquisition “isn’t a short-term play.” “It’s a structural alignment with the future of money, and a strategy to protect our balance sheet while compounding long-term value.” He further said that H100’s strategy is to “build and hold,” adding that Bitcoin is not a trade, but rather a savings technology and a resilient long-term asset to hold. “We announced an LOI for a convertible loan of up to 10M SEK to further accelerate our Bitcoin treasury strategy.” H100 Group has joined a growing list of public companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets in 2025. Some of the recent entrants include Twenty One Capital and Strive, among others. https://twitter.com/cryptonews/status/1925075067077329347 “We’re inspired by leading U.S. treasury companies and will continue looking for strategic opportunities to expand our Bitcoin holdings in a responsible and long-term oriented way,” Andersen added. Institutional Crypto Adoption is ‘Accelerating’: CEO The CEO highlighted that investors are increasingly expecting balance sheets to reflect the future in a long term. “H100 is proud to be an early mover in the Nordics, aligning our capital structure with the values we stand for,” he told Cryptonews. “We want to be a blueprint for how operational companies — especially those serving the sovereign individual — can integrate Bitcoin into their treasury and strategy.” H100’s Bitcoin debut comes at a time when Swedish lawmakers are pushing the government to build a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Last month, representatives from the Member of Parliament suggested that Sweden should begin accumulating Bitcoin through direct policy or a budget-neutral method. They submitted a letter to the country’s finance minister to seriously consider adding Bitcoin to Sweden’s national financial strategy. Addressing BTC Volatility When Considering as Treasury Asset CEO Andersen called Bitcoin the best-performing asset over the past decade, adding that more people are beginning to understand it. “We view Bitcoin as part of our liquidity — not as our core operational capital. H100 remains a health infrastructure company focused on preventive care,” he said. “But by allocating a portion of our reserves to Bitcoin, we’re aligning with the values and needs of the community we serve.” The post H100 Group Becomes Sweden’s First Publicly Listed Bitcoin Treasury Firm appeared first on Cryptonews .",cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/h100-group-becomes-swedens-first-publicly-listed-bitcoin-treasury-firm/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY","Bitcoin News|Bitcoin Reserve|Sweden",cryptocompare
2025-05-23T10:16:38.000Z,"Important Ripple (XRP) Developments, Cardano’s (ADA) Bull Run Potential, and More: Bits Recap May 23","TL;DR XRP’s price has stalled lately due to potential factors like the selling spree from whales and the SEC’s delayed decision on XRP ETF applications from CoinShares and Bitwise. Nearly one billion ADA has been withdrawn from exchanges in 2025, mirroring 2021’s pre-all-time-high trend. The shift to self-custody methods suggests reduced selling pressure and potential for a bullish breakout. DOGE shows a renewed momentum, with analysts forecasting a rally to $0.31, supported by rising whale activity, transaction volume, and user engagement. What’s New Around XRP? Ripple’s cross-border token has recorded relatively modest gains in the past week compared to bitcoin (BTC), whose price is up 7% for the timeframe, and some altcoins, which have charted even more impressive increases. Currently, XRP is worth around $2.43 (per CoinGecko’s data), representing a mere 1% rise on a seven-day scale. An important factor that has potentially put the brakes on the asset’s rally is the recent whale activity. As CryptoPotato recently reported , large investors have sold more than 60 million tokens (equaling roughly $145 million) in the span of three days. This development showcases reduced confidence in the asset. The whales’ actions are closely monitored by smaller players, who may take this as a worrying sign and also decide to cash out. It is worth mentioning that the big investors had a much different strategy in April, purchasing more than 900 million XRP tokens. Another element that could have suppressed the price of Ripple’s cryptocurrency is the US SEC’s delayed decision on the launch of two XRP ETFs proposed by CoinShares and Bitwise. While the introduction of the first spot XRP exchange-traded fund in the US is still waiting for approval, there are some futures-based products which are already live. Those curious to explore the topic in detail , can take a look at our article here . Is ADA Gearing up for a Big Move? Cardano’s native token has surged by 16% in the last month and is currently trading at around $0.81 (per CoinGecko’s data). Some essential indicators , though, suggest a much more explosive rally could be just around the corner. CryptoPotato recently revealed that nearly one billion ADA (worth around $800 million) were withdrawn from exchanges since the beginning of 2025, mirroring the negative netflows seen prior to its 2021 all-time high. Back then, ADA soared from $1.80 to over $3. Similar on-chain behavior now suggests that investors have moved from centralized exchanges to self-custody methods, reducing the immediate selling pressure. On the other hand, ADA’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates that a pullback in the short term is not out of the question. The momentum oscillator, which measures the speed and magnitude of price changes, varies from 0 to 100, and readings above 70 hint that the asset could be overbought and is due for a possible correction. The RSI spiked above that mark a few hours ago, but it is currently situated just south of it. ADA RSI, Source: CryptoWaves DOGE’s Next Targets The biggest meme coin is currently worth roughly $0.25, a 35% monthly rise. Its rally caught the eye of many industry participants, and some expect further gains in the near future. Ali Martinez claimed that DOGE “appears to be breaking out of a bull pennant, which suggests a target of $0.31.” Earlier this month, he outlined three bullish factors that might support an additional upside. Those include the rise in active addresses, transaction volume, and whale activity. The popular X user KALEO also chipped in. They predicted that DOGE’s price has yet to reach its market top, citing the BTC halving, which has previously been a precursor for massive gains.

2025-05-23T10:15:48.000Z,"Here’s why MEW rallied over 30% today","MEW rallied as high as 31% today after securing a listing on popular crypto and stock trading platform Robinhood. According to crypto.news, cat in a dogs world ( M EW ) surged to a four-month high of $0.0047 on May 23 Asian time, bringing its market capitalization to over $400 million at the time of writing. MEW’s trading activity accelerated sharply through the week, with volume climbing from $40 million on Wednesday to $70 million on Thursday, before surging over 370% to $315 million by Friday. There are four potential catalysts driving MEW’s rally. First, the biggest catalyst is MEW’s new Robinhood listing , which went live yesterday. It’s now tradable for U.S. users on the platform, adding to its visibility and credibility. MEW was listed alongside fellow Solana-based memecoin Moo Deng ( MOODENG ), which also saw gains of 25% over the past 24 hours. Listings on major platforms such as Robinhood often act as a stamp of credibility and attract a wave of new investors. Second, MEW participated in the Las Vegas Licensing Expo, the world’s largest licensing trade event. Held annually at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center, the expo brings together global IP leaders and brand developers. The expo marks a chance for MEW to present itself to an entirely new cohort of potential partners and consumers, a move that may have stirred fresh optimism among traders. You might also like: Worldcoin poised for breakout as bullish signals point to 60% upside Third, MEW recently teased a new partnership with Cuberium, a blockchain-powered GameFi platform known for its tower defense games and meme-token integrations. While full details haven’t been dropped yet, the teaser alone seems to have added to the hype. Lastly, the derivatives market is showing signs of strong bullish interest. According to CoinGlass , open interest in MEW futures surged 121% over the past 24 hours, reaching a five-month high of $72 million. On Binance, the long/short ratio remains well above 1, indicating that the majority of traders are positioning for further upside. The broader market is also supportive, with Bitcoin recently hitting a new all-time high , which has lifted sentiment across the entire sector. Signs of continuation From a technical perspective, MEW appears well-positioned for a potential continuation of the ongoing rally. On the 1-day/USDT price chart, MEW seems to be forming a round bottom pattern, a setup that often signals longer-term gains. The MACD lines are pointing upwards, and the Supertrend indicator just flipped green; both are considered bullish indicators. MEW price, Supertrend and MACD chart — May 23 | Source: crypto.news So, MEW could likely keep climbing over the next few days. While the trend remains strong, RSI levels nearing 84 may hint at an overheated market primed for a brief pullback. MEW RSI chart — May 23 | Source: crypto.news However, a high RSI doesn’t always signal an immediate reversal.

2025-05-23T10:13:34.000Z,"Institutions Take the Wheel in Bitcoin Rally as Retail Stays Quiet — Matrixport","Key Takeaways: Bitcoin’s latest rally is driven by institutional investors, not retail traders. Matrixport notes a structural shift as BTC is increasingly held by corporations for long-term positioning. Retail traders risk missing out by misreading the cycle’s lack of hype as lack of opportunity. Bitcoin has passed the $111,000 mark amid the recent rally, but the typical buzz from retail investors appears to be missing. According to a May 23 report from Matrixport , the current bull market is being driven primarily by institutional capital rather than the wave of individual buyers seen in past cycles. “This rally is unfolding largely without retail participation,” analysts wrote. “Instead of the usual buzz and euphoria, there’s a noticeable absence of retail momentum.” Bitcoin No Longer Runs on FOMO Matrixport said there has been a clear shift in Bitcoin’s market dynamics. In previous bull runs, individual investors often led the charge, with social media hype and FOMO fueling rapid price gains. But this time, large institutions, motivated by Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against inflation, are steering the market. “We’re witnessing a steady and quiet transfer of Bitcoin from early adopters, miners, and exchanges to a new class of investors, primarily corporations,” the report noted. #MatrixOnTarget Report – May 23, 2025 Our Bullish Bitcoin Prediction Is Coming True — But What Could Derail It? #Matrixport #BTC #Bitcoin #Crypto #CryptoMarket #BTCOptions #OptionsTrading #CryptoNews #BitcoinTrendUpdate #BullMarket #BitcoinPrice #CryptoAnalysis … pic.twitter.com/61qfr2DJyO — Matrixport Official (@Matrixport_EN) May 23, 2025 Among those leading the institutional push is Strategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. According to Bitcoin Treasuries data, 204 institutions currently hold BTC, with more than half being public companies. In just the last month, 11 new firms added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Strategy recently announced a plan to raise $2.1 billion through Series A Perpetual Preferred Stock, with proceeds potentially going toward further BTC acquisitions. The company already holds over 214,000 BTC — valued at more than $23.6 billion. Matrixport analysts also pointed out that the rally appears to be driven by spot market accumulation, rather than the more speculative derivatives activity that typically characterizes retail-driven pumps. This suggests a longer-term positioning from institutional players, as opposed to short-term profit-taking behavior. Retail May Miss Bitcoin Rally Amid Quiet Cycle The firm warned that many retail traders may be underestimating the current cycle, mistaking the lack of hype for a lack of opportunity. These traders often fall into the trap of reacting emotionally to market corrections, rather than following on-chain and macro indicators that institutions rely on. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $111,300, up 0.46% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, according to Dom Harz, Co-Founder of BOB, Bitcoin’s recent surge past its all-time high signals the start of a new chapter driven by institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and accelerating technological innovation. “What we can say with certainty is that Bitcoin is maturing and entering a phase defined by institutional adoption, clearer regulation, and, critically, rapid technological progress,” Harz said in a note shared with Cryptonews.com. The convergence of mainstream adoption and technical progress, he argues, is set to fundamentally reshape how Bitcoin is used, moving beyond a simple store of value into a key player in decentralized financial systems.

Bull Flag Builds Beneath $180 Ceiling SOL spent two weeks consolidating below $180, carving out a textbook bull-flag pattern that typically precedes further upside. The daily relative strength index sits at 64, far from overheated territory, suggesting room to run if buyers step in. Fractal Echoes 2024’s Explosive Breakout Crypto trader Robert Mercer highlighted similarities to October 2024, when Solana cleared $180 and sprinted to an eventual $260 peak. He argues a decisive weekly close above $180 “could trigger a sharp upward rally, mirroring the late-2024 move.” Analyst Javon Marks added that a hidden bullish divergence on the three-day chart once sparked a 1,332 percent rally, implying even $450 is conceivable should history rhyme. Volume Remains the Missing Ingredient Skeptics point out that spot buying volumes have faded during consolidation, leaving the breakout thesis contingent on renewed demand. Failure to conquer $180 could send SOL toward support in the $140-$150 corridor, invalidating the flag. Popular trader XO recommends watching for a clean flip of $180 into support before entering longs. Macro Rotations Could Help With Bitcoin setting records, some speculators anticipate a rotation of profits into major altcoins, a pattern seen in prior cycles. Whether that shift materializes will depend on risk appetite, macro data, and how quickly new capital filters through ETFs into the broader crypto complex.

Traders Rotate to XRP, Solana, ADA as Bitcoin Loses Steam appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Altcoins have struggled to keep up in the current market cycle, even as Bitcoin (BTC) Price repeatedly hits new all-time highs. This has been reflected in Bitcoin’s rising dominance, highlighting its outperformance over most altcoins. However, with BTC now consolidating just below $111,000 after a strong week, traders are starting to rotate into major altcoins like XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA), sparking bullish sentiment for a potential altcoin season. Are we in yet? Let’s find out! Altcoins Back in Action Bitcoin’s recent surge, powered by institutional interest and regulatory clarity, is starting to lose steam as traders book profits. This has opened the door for high-cap altcoins to shine. Solana and ADA rose up to 4% in the last 24 hours, while XRP gained modestly by under 1.5% . Ether and BNB also ticked higher. According to Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, we could be on the verge of a broader altcoin rally if Bitcoin’s dominance dips. He believes XRP and Solana are in prime position to lead this move. Lee points to XRP’s improving legal standing and a bullish chart pattern known as a golden cross, which could drive the token toward the $3 to $8 range. Technicals and Trends Back the Bullish Case The optimism comes on the back of last month’s SEC decision to halt appeals against Ripple. With regulatory clouds clearing, XRP has broken out of a long-running sideways trend. Meanwhile, SOL is seeing momentum from speculation around a potential ETF and could head toward $220–$300, according to Lee. QCP Capital added that Bitcoin’s current rally feels more stable than previous ones, driven by strong fundamentals and lower speculation. However, they caution that macro factors like rising U.S. bond yields, renewed trade tensions, and a stronger dollar could still create bumps in the road, especially for altcoins. Market Mood Still Bullish FxPro analyst Alex Kuptsikevich noted that Bitcoin’s sentiment index is close to “extreme greed,” hinting that despite the pause, more upside may lie ahead.

2025-05-23T10:05:30.000Z,"Crypto Market Surges: Top Crypto Investments for rest of 2025 Bull Market","As the crypto market breaks into what could potentially be the final, and possibly the most prolific stage of the bull run, what could be the best crypto investments for those looking to enter this sector? To begin with, much caution should be taken by investors about to take the plunge at this stage of the crypto bull market, especially if you have little to no knowledge of crypto. This is an incredibly volatile market, and novices enter at your peril. What kind of assets are there on offer in crypto? The assets in this sector might all come under the umbrella of ‘ cryptocurrencies ’, but just as in the stock market, there are categories that contain plenty of variety. Firstly, there is Bitcoin - all in a category of its own because it accounts for nearly 64% of the entire crypto market. This is the grade A investment. Blackrock, the biggest asset manager in the world, is buying BTC for clients at a phenomenal rate. Some of the US Spot Bitcoin ETFs , launched over 17 months ago, are the most successful ever. That said, would you want to be investing your money into an asset that has already climbed 600% since the bull market began in January 2023? Layer 1 blockchains (large caps) The second sector is the ‘layer 1’ blockchains. These include the likes of Ethereum (ETH), Binance Chain (BNB), Solana (SOL), Cardano, (ADA), Tron (TRX), and Sui (SUI). These are also relatively stable cryptocurrencies, at least when compared with the ‘small-caps’. They are the big smart contract platforms, and as such, they provide the base layer for other cryptocurrencies and dApps to be built upon. The rest of crypto The third category mentioned here is basically the rest of crypto. These include medium, and small cap cryptocurrencies. These are generally termed the ‘alts’, which comes from the term ‘altcoin’ (alternative coin), although any cryptocurrency outside of Bitcoin is also basically an ‘alt’. These three categories contain all the cryptocurrencies. Although there are plenty of categories within categories, I will just mention one of these, because it is the sub-category that seems to attract most first-time investors into crypto. This is the ‘memecoin’ sector. What is a memecoin? While many cryptocurrencies will have some kind of value proposition to them, memecoins in the main will have absolutely nothing but fresh air behind them. It is important to remember that when you buy a memecoin, you are buying something akin to a lottery ticket, in that the chance of you cashing out winnings and not taking a loss, are rather small. Probably, most investors who buy memecoins aren’t traders, and they might therefore buy when the memecoin is near its top, and sell when it is approaching the bottom. As a rule of thumb, only around 5% or so of investors will ever beat the market in any particular year. Investing Now that the crypto market has a very general categorisation, what could a speculator invest in? Obviously, this very much depends on your tolerance for risk, and the amount of money you choose to invest. It is quite critical to understand that reading one or two articles on the internet does not make anyone an expert. Before making any investment, plenty of research should be done. Also, because of the high-risk nature of investing, and particularly so in crypto, buying with only a small percentage of your investment is perhaps a good start. Finally, there is short-term and long-term investing. Short-term investing carries far more risk, and is a bit like betting at a roulette wheel. The house (the exchange) is generally working against you, and is able to deploy algorithms that can even liquidate the professionals. Therefore, it’s probably better that the newbie investor into crypto thinks more long term. Where Bitcoin is concerned, a timeline of at least 4 or 5 years can be a better investment. Fiat currency is the worst asset to keep your savings in, so a sound money store of value such as Bitcoin or gold is much more likely to pay off over the long run. What about the other cryptocurrencies? The truth is, that unless you invested into cryptocurrencies at the beginning of the bull market, they have only become riskier as the bull market draws towards its end. Yes, there will likely still be opportunities for some potential great gains from some of the altcoins, but once again, if you are not an expert in this space, your likelihood of picking those winners will be slim. However, if you decide that losing 10% or more of your purchasing power each year by holding onto your dollar, pound, yen, or whatever fiat currency it is, is too much to bear, and that you feel you are forced to speculate in order to keep your head above water, perhaps a small investment into the altcoins could be a possibility. Spend some time on YouTube, get lucky, and find an expert that is not being paid to shill some altcoin or other. There are plenty of good people out there with a wealth of knowledge that can give you an edge. You just have to find them. Good luck in your journey, and do be aware that this is an absolutely critical journey. The path ahead for fiat currencies, government bonds, banks, and anything else to do with the so-called ‘money’ system that we use today, is fraught with peril, and the rulers of the world are looking for those without vital economic knowledge to foot the bill - make sure you aren’t one of them.

2025-05-23T10:00:42.000Z,"Bitcoin Miner MARA Holdings and Two Prime Forge Strategic Partnership Expansion","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Miner MARA Holdings and Two Prime Forge Strategic Partnership Expansion Hey there, crypto enthusiasts and finance watchers! Get ready for some significant news from the world of digital assets. A major player in the Bitcoin mining space, MARA Holdings, is taking its relationship with digital asset fund Two Prime to the next level. This isn’t just a simple extension; it’s a strategic expansion that involves a substantial allocation of Bitcoin – 500 BTC, to be exact – into Two Prime’s managed strategies. This move builds upon their existing collaboration, which previously focused on BTC-backed loans. It signals a growing sophistication in how companies with significant crypto holdings are looking to manage and enhance the efficiency of those assets. This development is particularly noteworthy for those following the trajectory of institutional crypto adoption and the evolving landscape of digital asset management . What’s Behind the MARA Holdings and Two Prime Strategic Move? Let’s break down who the players are and what makes this development so interesting. On one side, we have MARA Holdings (Marathon Digital Holdings), one of the largest and most well-known publicly traded Bitcoin mining companies in North America. As a miner, MARA accumulates a significant amount of BTC through its operations. Managing this growing treasury of digital assets is a crucial part of their business strategy, extending beyond just the mining process itself. On the other side is Two Prime, a digital asset fund focused on providing financial solutions and managed strategies for digital assets, often catering to institutional and sophisticated investors. Their expertise lies in navigating the complexities of the crypto market to potentially generate returns or manage risk for their clients. Their relationship isn’t new. Prior to this announcement, MARA and Two Prime had already established a working crypto partnership centered around Bitcoin -backed loans. In a traditional sense, this would involve MARA potentially using its BTC holdings as collateral to borrow fiat currency or other assets, providing MARA with liquidity while Two Prime earns interest and holds collateral. This new development represents an evolution of that relationship, moving beyond simple lending into active asset management. It highlights a deepening trust and a shared vision for how digital assets can be utilized more effectively within a corporate treasury context. From Loans to Allocation: The Evolution of This Crypto Partnership Understanding the difference between the previous loan structure and the new allocation is key to appreciating the significance of this expansion. Think of it like this: Previous Loan Structure: MARA needed capital (e.g., USD) for operations or expansion. They would pledge a certain amount of their mined Bitcoin as collateral to Two Prime and receive a loan in return. MARA pays interest on the loan, and Two Prime holds the BTC securely as collateral until the loan is repaid. The primary goal for MARA here is accessing liquidity without selling their BTC. New Allocation to Managed Strategies: MARA is now entrusting 500 BTC directly to Two Prime’s management team. Two Prime will deploy this BTC within their specific strategies, aiming to generate returns on the allocated assets for MARA. The primary goal for MARA here shifts from accessing liquidity to potentially growing their BTC holdings or generating yield from them. This transition signifies a higher level of engagement and trust. It suggests that MARA is not just seeing its Bitcoin holdings as static collateral but as active capital that can be put to work through professional digital asset management . Why 500 Bitcoin Matters for Capital Efficiency 500 Bitcoin is a considerable sum, currently valued in the tens of millions of dollars depending on the market price. For a company like MARA Holdings , whose core business is accumulating BTC, finding ways to make that accumulated wealth work harder is paramount to enhancing capital efficiency. Simply holding mined Bitcoin on a balance sheet exposes the company solely to the price volatility of BTC. While price appreciation is a primary driver for a miner’s value, generating additional yield or returns from the existing holdings can significantly boost overall financial performance and provide a buffer against market downturns. By allocating 500 BTC to Two Prime’s managed strategies, MARA is essentially seeking to generate yield or achieve growth on this portion of their treasury. This could involve various strategies within the DeFi or centralized crypto finance space, managed by Two Prime’s expertise. The aim is to create an additional revenue stream or asset growth mechanism on top of their core mining operations. This strategic use of a significant Bitcoin treasury is a strong indicator of how sophisticated corporate entities are approaching their digital asset holdings. It’s moving beyond simple hodling into active, professional treasury management within the crypto ecosystem. Deep Dive into Digital Asset Management Strategies What exactly does it mean for Two Prime to manage 500 BTC within their ‘managed strategies’? While the specific details of Two Prime’s strategies are proprietary, digital asset management for institutional clients typically involves a range of activities designed to generate yield, manage risk, or achieve capital appreciation. These can include: Lending: Loaning out the Bitcoin to vetted institutional borrowers for a return (interest). This is a common yield-generating strategy. DeFi Protocols: Engaging with decentralized finance applications for activities like yield farming, staking (if applicable to wrapped BTC or other forms), or providing liquidity. This often comes with higher potential returns but also increased complexity and smart contract risk. Structured Products: Utilizing more complex financial instruments built on digital assets, potentially involving options or other derivatives to enhance yield or provide hedging. Algorithmic Trading: Employing automated strategies to capitalize on market inefficiencies or trends, though this is less common for large, static allocations intended for yield. By entrusting this to Two Prime, MARA Holdings gains access to specialized knowledge, infrastructure, and risk management frameworks that might be challenging or resource-intensive to build internally. It allows MARA to focus on its core competency – mining Bitcoin – while professionals manage a portion of their accumulated assets. How This Partnership Signals Growing Institutional Crypto Confidence The expansion of the crypto partnership between MARA Holdings and Two Prime is more than just a deal between two companies; it’s a significant data point in the broader narrative of institutional crypto adoption. Here’s why: Public Company Engagement: MARA is a publicly traded company. Their willingness to publicly announce and engage in sophisticated digital asset management strategies with a dedicated fund signals increasing comfort and acceptance of crypto financial products within the traditional corporate structure. Validation of Digital Asset Funds: Partnerships like this validate the business model and expertise of digital asset funds like Two Prime. It shows that there is real demand from corporate and institutional players for professional management of their crypto holdings. Maturation of the Ecosystem: The ability to move from simple BTC-backed loans to more active, managed strategies demonstrates the maturation of the crypto financial ecosystem. The infrastructure and service providers are evolving to meet the complex needs of larger entities. Setting a Precedent: Other companies, particularly other Bitcoin miners or corporations holding BTC on their balance sheets, will likely observe the outcome of this partnership. Successful execution could encourage more entities to explore similar strategies for enhancing capital efficiency and managing their digital assets. This collaboration underscores the fact that institutional crypto isn’t just about buying Bitcoin ; it’s increasingly about how to integrate these assets into existing financial operations and leverage them strategically. Navigating the Landscape: Benefits and Potential Challenges Like any financial strategy, this expanded crypto partnership comes with its potential upsides and risks. Potential Benefits for MARA Holdings: Enhanced Capital Efficiency: Potentially generate yield or growth on 500 BTC that would otherwise be sitting passively. Diversification of Revenue Streams: Create income from asset management alongside mining operations. Access to Expertise: Leverage Two Prime’s specialized knowledge and infrastructure in digital asset management . Professional Risk Management: Benefit from Two Prime’s frameworks for managing risks associated with their strategies. Potential Challenges and Risks: Market Volatility: The value of the underlying 500 BTC is still subject to the inherent volatility of the Bitcoin market. While strategies might aim for yield, the principal value can fluctuate significantly. Strategy Performance Risk: There’s no guarantee that Two Prime’s managed strategies will be profitable. Poor performance could lead to losses on the allocated BTC. Counterparty Risk: Risk associated with Two Prime as the managing entity. Although less of a concern with established funds, it’s a factor in any partnership. Complexity: Understanding and monitoring complex digital asset management strategies requires internal expertise or strong reporting from the partner. For MARA Holdings , the decision to allocate this significant amount of Bitcoin indicates a calculated assessment of these benefits and risks, likely driven by the potential to unlock greater value from their substantial BTC holdings. Looking Ahead: Implications for Miners and Institutions This expanded crypto partnership between MARA Holdings and Two Prime could set a precedent for how other Bitcoin miners and corporations with significant crypto treasuries manage their assets. As the crypto market matures, simply holding assets is becoming less appealing compared to strategies that can generate additional returns. We may see more miners and public companies explore similar collaborations with digital asset funds specializing in yield generation, lending, or other forms of active digital asset management . This trend would further bridge the gap between traditional corporate finance and the innovative possibilities within the crypto ecosystem. For the institutional crypto space, this is a positive signal. It demonstrates that demand exists for sophisticated financial products and services built around digital assets, moving beyond simple spot trading or custody. It encourages the development of more robust and compliant solutions tailored for the needs of large-scale investors and corporations. Conclusion The expansion of the crypto partnership between MARA Holdings and Two Prime, marked by the allocation of 500 Bitcoin to managed strategies, is a significant step for both companies and the wider institutional crypto landscape. It signifies a strategic shift for MARA towards enhancing the capital efficiency of its substantial BTC holdings through professional digital asset management . This move highlights the increasing sophistication in how corporations are interacting with digital assets and validates the growing importance of specialized funds like Two Prime in providing advanced financial solutions in this evolving market. As the digital asset space continues to mature, expect to see more such strategic collaborations aimed at unlocking the full potential of crypto treasuries.

2025-05-23T10:00:37.000Z,"Bitcoin Smashes Past $111K, But Are Traders About to Dump?","Bitcoin has surpassed its previous all-time high again, registering a new peak above $111,000 amid continued bullish momentum across the crypto market. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $111,226, reflecting a 2.2% increase in the past 24 hours. This upward movement has pushed the asset beyond the psychological threshold of $110,000, reinforcing optimism in its medium-term trajectory. However, analysts are monitoring underlying market data that may signal emerging risks beneath the surface of the rally. Related Reading: Binance Bitcoin Outflows and MVRV Ratio Point to Sustained Bullish Setup, Analyst Reveals Bitcoin Exchange Inflows and Leverage Ratios Reflect Growing Caution CryptoQuant contributor Amr Taha recently published a detailed analysis highlighting key metrics from Binance, including net flows, open interest, and leverage levels. These metrics, when taken together, reveal a familiar setup reminiscent of December 2024, a period that preceded short-term corrections. While Bitcoin’s price action has remained positive, the presence of high exchange inflows and speculative positioning could indicate that some investors are preparing for profit-taking. According to Taha, Binance has observed a notable increase in inflows, with approximately 3,000 BTC and 60,000 ETH entering the exchange as Bitcoin broke its all-time high. This shift from net outflows to inflows suggests that investors may be transferring assets to trading platforms with the intent to sell or adjust their positions. Historically, large net inflows during price peaks have been linked to increased selling activity, particularly when market participants aim to secure gains after extended uptrends. Taha also noted that open interest (OI) on Binance has climbed back above $12 billion levels last seen in December 2024. Open interest refers to the total value of outstanding futures contracts and is often viewed as an indicator of speculative engagement in the market. While rising OI can support upward continuation during bullish phases, it may also increase the risk of volatility if not supported by fresh spot market demand. Compounding this, Binance’s estimated leverage ratio has returned to 0.20, mirroring previous highs and suggesting that many traders are utilizing significant leverage. Elevated leverage levels tend to heighten sensitivity to price fluctuations and can amplify liquidations during abrupt corrections. Related Reading: Bitcoin Shows Elevated Unrealized Profits Without Signs Of Panic Selling – New ATH Soon? Are Market Conditions Echoing December’s Setup? Taha concluded his analysis, revealing that while none of these indicators are inherently bearish on their own, their simultaneous occurrence around a new all-time high could point toward short-term instability. In previous cycles, such combinations of high leverage, rising OI, and exchange inflows have been associated with increased profit-taking and localized pullbacks. Taha wrote: These are not inherently bearish signals in isolation. However, when combined, they historically correlate with profit-taking behavior and often precede volatility spikes or corrections. Traders and investors should remain alert: these same conditions marked the beginning of localized tops in late 2024, especially after periods of aggressive upside.

2025-05-23T09:37:08.000Z,"According to Data Analytics Firm Glassnode, Investors Have Started Accumulating Bitcoin Aggressively! Here Are the Details","Bitcoin has gained 18% in the past month, rising above $110,000 once again. Amid this rally, Bitcoin has entered its strongest accumulation period since January, according to data from on-chain data analytics firm Glassnode. Bitcoin Surpasses $110,000: Enters Strongest Accumulation Period Since January Glassnode’s Accumulation Trend Score has currently reached its maximum level of 1.0, meaning that all wallet groups, from large investors to small investors, are aggressively accumulating BTC. The metric takes into account purchases made over the last 15 days and current balances; exchanges and miners are excluded from the analysis. This wave of accumulation, which began in early May, was led by whales holding more than 10,000 BTC. As the Bitcoin price moved upwards, smaller wallets joined the trend, increasing their holdings. This new trend represents a major change compared to the January-April period. During that period, most investors reduced their BTC holdings due to the price drop. As you may recall, Bitcoin fell from $109,000 to $75,000 during this period. In addition to the accumulation trend, strong bullish positions in the options markets also support this increase in demand. The $300,000 call option for the June expiration has become the most popular option, with the total open position size at this level being $620 million. In addition, an additional position of $420 million in call options at the $200,000 level is also noteworthy. While Bitcoin has typically experienced a price pullback due to profit taking when it reached all-time highs in the past, experts are considering a different scenario this time. Traditional assets like the S&P 500 and gold tend to continue their rise after new highs. A similar behavior for Bitcoin could mean the start of a long-term bull market. While this development is being followed carefully in the markets, analysts state that new peaks may be possible with high volatility in the coming weeks. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-23T09:36:13.000Z,"A $500 in MUTM could turn into $50K next bull run — here’s why","Imagine this: you invest just $500 in a promising new crypto project today, and in the next major market upswing, that small investment could grow into a life-changing $50,000 or more. It sounds like a dream, but for many early crypto adopters, this has been a reality. Now, a new opportunity is emerging with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized lending and borrowing platform with huge potential to follow in the footsteps of early Bitcoin, SHIB, and FLOKI investors — and possibly even move faster. The dream of turning small investments into huge gains Bitcoin started as a simple idea, and its early buyers saw unbelievable returns—turning pocket change into millions. Later, memecoins like SHIB and FLOKI surged, rewarding patient holders with massive gains, even though their tokens began at fractions of a cent. Mutuum Finance offers a similar story with a twist. Today, the MUTM token is priced at just $0.03 with 150 million tokens unlocked in its current phase and around 500 million tokens sold overall. With nearly 11,000 holders already, the foundation is set for a potential breakout. But why could $500 in MUTM multiply dramatically in the next bull run? Let’s explore the math and the unique qualities of this project. Math-backed projections: what could $500 become? At $0.03 per token, investing $500 gets you approximately 16,667 MUTM tokens. What happens if MUTM reaches different future price points? If MUTM hits $0.50, your 16,667 tokens would be worth $8,333. At $1.00, they would become $16,667 and if the price reaches $5.00, your investment jumps to $83,335. Even a modest price increase to just 50 cents means over a 16x gain, turning your initial $500 into more than $8,000. And hitting $1 or $5 could bring life-changing returns of $16,000 or more. Considering that the total supply is still growing and Mutuum Finance is in an early phase, the potential upside remains significant if the project gains traction. Lessons from Bitcoin, SHIB, and FLOKI early adopters Bitcoin early adopters had to believe in the tech and hold through tough times. Their patience paid off with exponential rewards. SHIB and FLOKI holders enjoyed rapid gains fueled by viral hype and community support. MUTM combines these advantages with a solid decentralized finance (DeFi) use case, offering more than just hype. Mutuum’s unique lending and borrowing protocol makes it stand out. Unlike simple memecoins, it builds a functional ecosystem where MUTM holders can earn real utility and passive income. This foundation could accelerate its growth faster than projects that rely solely on speculation. Understanding Mutuum Finance: P2P and P2C models Mutuum Finance operates with two key models: peer-to-pool (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P). In P2C, users deposit cryptocurrencies into shared liquidity pools that automatically match borrowers and lenders, adjusting interest rates based on supply and demand. This system keeps the platform balanced and rewards both lenders and borrowers fairly. In the P2P model, users negotiate loans directly, allowing customized terms and rates. This flexibility helps cater to different risk appetites and investment strategies, making Mutuum Finance accessible and adaptable. This dynamic ecosystem empowers MUTM holders to participate actively and benefit financially from the platform’s growth. Why the MUTM token holds value The MUTM token is more than a simple investment; it’s the backbone of Mutuum Finance’s decentralized protocol. A portion of the protocol’s revenue is used to buy back MUTM tokens from the open market, distributing these as passive dividends to users who stake their tokens in special contracts called safety modules. This means that long-term holders not only gain from price appreciation but also receive ongoing rewards simply by participating in the platform. The token’s utility in staking, and dividends creates strong incentives for users to hold and use MUTM, supporting sustainable demand and price growth. One of the unique features of Mutuum Finance is how it allows users to borrow against their assets without selling them. This means you can unlock liquidity while still holding onto your investments, avoiding taxes and maintaining potential upside. For example, if you believe your Ethereum will rise, you can use it as collateral to borrow stablecoins and invest elsewhere. This strategy helps investors stay agile and seize opportunities without losing exposure to their original assets. MUTM holders benefit from this advanced DeFi functionality, adding real-world utility to the token. While no investment is guaranteed, Mutuum Finance’s combination of a growing user base, innovative lending models, and strong token utility creates a promising environment for growth. The crypto market’s history shows that early investments in projects with solid fundamentals and community support can multiply many times over. For dreamers willing to invest $500 today, MUTM offers a chance to join a fast-growing DeFi ecosystem and potentially transform a modest stake into tens of thousands of dollars. Whether MUTM reaches $0.50, $1, or beyond, the opportunity to turn a small investment into a significant fortune is within reach. Why now is the time to act The next bull run could be just around the corner. With Mutuum Finance unlocking more tokens and expanding its liquidity pools, early investors have a window to get in before the crowd. The combination of smart protocol design, real utility, and strong community momentum makes MUTM a project worth watching—and investing in. In conclusion, $500 in MUTM today isn’t just an investment; it’s a ticket to potential life-changing rewards. Like the early days of Bitcoin, SHIB, and FLOKI, Mutuum Finance offers a pathway for dreamers to grow modest investments into something extraordinary. If you’re ready to take a calculated chance on the future of DeFi, MUTM could be your next big opportunity.

2025-05-23T09:35:40.000Z,"Ripple CEO Garlinghouse Says “XRP Moves Value In Seconds”","Popular XRP community member XRP Avenger (@XRP_Avengers) recently shared a video clip featuring Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, where the executive discussed XRP’s practical use in global payments. The post responds to another post about XRP’s rising value, reaffirming investor interest in the asset’s role in the digital payments ecosystem. Brad Garlinghouse: \"" #XRP moves value in seconds\"" LFG $XRP https://t.co/R8CXdEH11v pic.twitter.com/5HWwg7k6Xy — XRP Avengers (@XRP_Avengers) May 21, 2025 Solving Legacy Banking Challenges In the video, Garlinghouse explains how Ripple is leveraging XRP to modernize cross-border transactions by eliminating the traditional need for pre-funded accounts between financial institutions. He describes how a bank must maintain dormant capital in foreign accounts to facilitate transactions under the current correspondent banking model. Ripple’s solution replaces that with real-time liquidity sourced through XRP. Garlinghouse stated that Ripple enables institutions to tap into the liquidity of the digital asset, referencing its established trading volume with fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar and the British pound. This model allows for instant settlement, removing the delays and inefficiencies of legacy systems. He emphasized that using XRP for payments allows value to move “in real-time, in seconds.” Speed and Scalability Compared to Bitcoin Comparing XRP with Bitcoin, Garlinghouse pointed to transaction speed and scalability. He stated, “Even compared to Bitcoin, which takes up to 12 minutes to complete one transaction, XRP is extremely fast at about three seconds per transaction.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Notably, Ripple President Monica Long recently pointed to XRP’s efficiency, noting that the asset is 120,000 times more efficient than Bitcoin. According to Garlinghouse, the asset’s speed allows for higher scalability and positions it as a more viable solution for payment providers and banks. Real Utility in a Volatile Market Importantly, Garlinghouse noted that consumers interacting with services built on Ripple’s technology may not even realize that XRP facilitates the transaction. From the user’s perspective, the benefit comes through faster service and better pricing. “What the consumer sees is simply a better product at a better price,” he said. The CEO touched on the broader cryptocurrency environment, acknowledging ongoing uncertainty and skepticism. Despite this, he maintained that Ripple’s use of XRP presents a “real use case solving a real problem for real customers.” He characterized the current momentum as the strongest the company has seen in using XRP to move liquidity globally. XRP Avenger’s post reflects this optimism by highlighting Garlinghouse’s core message of XRP’s speed. The asset’s speed and low cost have made it a popular option for cross-border payments, and many experts have predicted that Ripple, using XRP, will eventually replace SWIFT as the biggest payment processor for international payments.

2025-05-23T09:31:15.000Z,"From Pizzas to Dinner With President: Trump and Justin Sun’s Handshake Signals a New Era for Crypto","On May 22, 2010, programmer Laszlo Hanyecz made history by spending 10,000 BTC on two pizzas — the first-ever real-world Bitcoin transaction. Since then, “Bitcoin Pizza Day” has become a symbolic celebration for the crypto community. Fifteen years later, the symbolic power of this date has only deepened. On May 22, 2025, Bitcoin broke past $110,000 for the first time — and on the same day, President Donald Trump gathered the top 220 holders of $TRUMP for a private dinner. The moment carried more than just fanfare — it marked a shift. As the most powerful figure in the world welcomed crypto believers into the halls of power, one face stood out under the spotlight: Justin Sun — Founder of TRON, Advisor to HTX, and the largest $TRUMP holder. Justin and the Long Journey Toward Crypto Mainstream Crypto’s path from the fringes of the internet to the core of global politics is an epic marked by builders, believers, and long-term visionaries. When Laszlo posted his now-famous “pizza trade” on a forum in 2010, few could have imagined Bitcoin — or crypto — standing at the heart of U.S. political power just 15 years later. This transformation was made possible by those who committed themselves to the cause, year after year. Justin is one of those rare figures who has never wavered. For over a decade, he’s not only stayed the course — he’s helped define it. On the technical front, TRON has become one of the most active blockchain networks globally, especially in stablecoin payments. Millions of users rely on this foundation every day. On the cultural front, Justin has used his influence and HTX’s global brand to break crypto into the mainstream consciousness. From the legendary lunch with Warren Buffett to headline-grabbing art purchases, from a Forbes magazine cover to space travel giveaways for HTX users — Justin has consistently opened the window between the crypto world and the general public. In recent years, Justin’s strategy has expanded. He made two major investments totaling $75 million into World Liberty Financial (WLFI), the Trump family’s crypto project. He now serves as the project’s strategic advisor. At TOKEN2049 in Dubai, Justin was seen in a relaxed conversation with Eric Trump. Not long after, WLFI’s stablecoin USD1 was listed on HTX. Notably, all of this began long before Wall Street giants jumped into crypto — and well before the U.S. political establishment started seriously debating crypto regulation. Why was Justin so early? “From the beginning, I believed that Donald Trump’s influence would bring a huge wave of positive momentum into space,” said Justin. “As an advisor, I’m actively involved in providing insights and helping bridge the gap between crypto and traditional politics. Our objective is to establish a robust, long-term relationship with the Trump family and onboard individuals from traditional industries into Web3.” Behind the Dinner: A New Chapter for Crypto In his first term, Trump was openly skeptical of Bitcoin. But now, crypto has become a major card in his second-term agenda and a tool to rally next-generation voters. Hosting a dinner for $TRUMP holders sends a clear message: crypto is no longer a fringe asset — it is being embraced by political elites at the highest level. And so, on the same day the world celebrates Bitcoin Pizza Day, Justin stood at the heart of American political power — carrying with him the hopes, infrastructure, and global vision of an entire industry. This was no coincidence — this was crypto’s rise from the edges to the center. Justin was not just a guest — he was a messenger, a facilitator, and a representative of the broader crypto world. He extended an olive branch from Web3 to the traditional system — while guiding mainstream players into the blockchain era. When Trump and Justin shook hands, the distance between crypto and the establishment closed just a little more. As crypto moves from being anti-establishment to influencing the establishment itself, leaders like Justin are helping write the new global rules of engagement. With the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act passed, the GENIUS stablecoin bill under review, and Bitcoin reaching unprecedented heights, the future that crypto believers have long envisioned may now be arriving. From Pizza to the Presidency — And Beyond Bitcoin Pizza Day is not just a festive — it’s a reminder. That all great things begin with small steps: two pizzas, two dreamers, and a piece of code no one fully understands yet. Today, as crypto leaders toast with a sitting U.S. President, the story continues — in a new form, on a new stage. The only question now is: How will we write the next 15 years? Justin is still running. And all of us — builders, traders, believers — are running with him.

A Danvers man was sentenced on Friday to six years in prison for running an unlicensed Bitcoin ( BTC ) money transmitting business that authorities say converted over $1 million in cash, including money linked to scammers and a drug dealer. Trung Nguyen — also known as “DCS420” — was sentenced to six years in prison, followed by three years of supervised release, and was ordered to forfeit more than $1.5 million after being convicted in November 2024 of conducting an unlicensed money transmitting business and money laundering, the U.S. Department of Justice said in a Friday press release . Nguyen owned and operated National Vending between 2017 and 2020, a business that accepted cash from customers and sent them Bitcoin in return for a fee, but he failed to register it with FinCEN or comply with anti-money laundering rules required under federal law. Prosecutors claim Nguyen knowingly concealed his operation by presenting National Vending as a vending machine business and used encrypted messaging to make tracing transactions harder. “He [Nguyen] used encrypted messaging apps to communicate with customers, using technologies that made it more difficult to trace Bitcoin transactions and breaking cash deposits of more than $10,000 into smaller cash deposits over consecutive days or at different branches of the same bank.” U.S. Attorney’s Office, District of Massachusetts You might also like: DOJ narrows charges against Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm ahead of July 14 trial Prosecutors say Nguyen accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars from individuals, including a methamphetamine dealer and victims of romance scams.

2025-05-23T09:21:10.000Z,"BTC price holds up above $110k, Matrixport highlights what makes the ongoing rally unique","As the BTC price stays well above the $110,000 threshold, Matrixport reveals what makes this BTC bull rally different than the others that came before it. In a recent post , Matrixport analysts have noted the evident absence of retail investors in the latest Bitcoin ( BTC ) rally. Unlike previous bull markets , in which the rally was mostly fueled by retail participation, this time around the firm concludes that the retail investor’s portion in driving the rally is no longer expanding as largely as it used to. “This rally is unfolding largely without retail participation. Instead of the usual buzz and euphoria, there’s noticeable absence of retail momentum,” wrote Matrixport analysts in their latest executive summary published on May 23. Instead, the main drivers of the current Bitcoin rally are institutional investors that have recognized the value in storing funds into BTC as a hedge against inflation. Matrixport believes it is crucial to understand the impact of corporate players on the BTC price as the shift in demand from retail to institutional investors continues to accelerate. “We’re witnessing a steady and quiet transfer of Bitcoin from early adopters and investors, miners and exchanges to a new class of investors, primarily corporations, with Michael Saylor’s Strategy leading the charge,” wrote Matrixport. Around 204 entities currently hold Bitcoin in their treasuries, amounting to 3.34 million BTC in total, May 23, 2025 | Source: Bitcoin Treasuries You might also like: CryptoQuant CEO admits he was wrong about Bitcoin bull cycle According to data from Bitcoin Treasuries, there are a total of 204 institutions that hold Bitcoin as of May 23, 2025, with more than 50% of entities being public companies. In the past month, there have been 11 new companies adopting BTC into their treasuries. Most recently, Strategy announced plans to issue to $2.1 billion in Series A Perpetual Preferred Stock. The funds generated from the sale will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include acquiring more Bitcoin. As the largest corporate holder of BTC, Strategy holds more than 214,000 BTC or equal to over $23.6 billion. Additionally, by recognizing that the recent rally is not being driven by traditional retail engagement, Matrixport analysts believe that many traders are missing out on the current BTC price boom. A lot of retail traders have a tendency to make “costly mistakes” during momentary dips in the cycle. These mistakes could be avoided by anticipating the corrections in the cycle, which are usually signaled by indicators and signals floating around online or in analyses. Another detail noted by Matrixport is that the BTC price rally is being boosted by spot market accumulation instead of speculative derivatives activity. This could signify long-term positioning for the crypto market, rather than just short-term trading hype. At press time, Bitcoin has stayed relatively stable above the $110,000 mark. BTC price is currently at $110,923 after rising slightly by 0.42%, according to data from crypto.news. Its market cap stands at $2.19 trillion with a daily trading volume of more than $39 billion.

2025-05-23T09:15:50.000Z,"H100 Group Soars 37% After Bitcoin Purchase Amid Rising BTC Buys","Two publicly listed companies—Sweden’s H100 Group AB and China’s Jiuzi Holdings—have made bold strides into Bitcoin this week, signaling the continued trend of corporations adopting cryptocurrency as a strategic asset. H100’s first BTC acquisition led to a sharp rise in its stock price, while Jiuzi announced an ambitious plan to accumulate 1,000 BTC over the next 12 months. H100 Kicks Off “Phase 1” with $490K Bitcoin Buy On May 22, health tech company H100 revealed that it had purchased 4.39 BTC for approximately 5 million Norwegian krone (around $490,830), paying an average price of $111,785 per BTC. Following the announcement, shares in H100 surged 37%, closing at 1.22 Swedish krona ($0.13) on the Nordic Growth Market, according to Bloomberg data . The dramatic jump in share price marks a partial recovery from the 46% drop the company’s stock experienced over the past two months. H100 CEO Sander Andersen explained that the move reflects the company’s alignment with Bitcoin’s philosophy of individual sovereignty. “The values of individual sovereignty highly present in the Bitcoin community align well with, and will appeal to, the customers and communities we are building the H100 platform for,” he stated. Andersen also hinted at future BTC investments, calling the current acquisition “Phase 1.” H100’s focus is on offering health tools to individuals seeking alternatives to traditional, reactive healthcare systems—an ethos that seemingly resonates with Bitcoin’s decentralized ideals. Jiuzi Holdings Eyes Aggressive BTC Accumulation Also on May 22, Nasdaq-listed Jiuzi Holdings announced that its board had approved a plan to acquire up to 1,000 BTC over the coming year. The Chinese electric vehicle retailer said it would fund the purchases through a mix of stock issuance and cash reserves. CEO Tao Li acknowledged Bitcoin’s notorious volatility but emphasized its potential to improve the company’s asset structure, resilience to economic shocks, and overall profitability. The market responded modestly to the news, with Jiuzi (JZXN) stock rising 7.3% to $3.09. These moves come amid a broader trend of Bitcoin adoption among publicly traded firms . According to BitcoinTreasuries.NET, 109 public companies now hold BTC on their balance sheets, signaling a growing acceptance of the digital asset as a long-term store of value and treasury reserve strategy.

S&P Global says that the combined assets of JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citibank and Wells Fargo ballooned by 5.9%, or $681.71 billion, in the first quarter of the year. The massive asset growth is in stark contrast to “a 2.9% contraction in the previous quarter.” “JPMorgan Chase & Co., the biggest US bank at $4.358 trillion in total assets as of March 31, reported an increase of $355.04 billion in assets in the first quarter. That marked the third-highest sequential increase among the nation’s 50 largest banks at 8.9%. Citigroup Inc. posted the second-highest sequential growth at 9.3%, or an increase of $218.57 billion in assets. Bank of America Corp. reported asset growth of 2.7% from the prior quarter, while Wells Fargo & Co.’s assets increased 1.1% in the same period.” Despite the massive asset growth, Moody’s downgraded the deposit ratings of top US lenders JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo earlier this week, just days after stripping the nation of its triple-A rating. The lenders’ long-term deposit ratings were lowered to Aa2, a one-step decrease and Moody’s third-highest level. The reason cited by Moody’s for the downgrade is the government’s weakened ability to support the banks. Last week, Moody’s downgraded America’s credit rating from AAA to Aa1 while changing the country’s outlook from negative to stable. Moody’s attributes the downgrade to the United States’ soaring national debt and interest payment ratios that exceed those of other countries with the same credit rating.

2025-05-23T09:10:00.000Z,"DOGE or Solana ETF in Q4? Analysts Predict This Hedge Fund Altcoin Will Outpace Both","Bitcoin was first developed to help people regain the financial freedom they lost with the slow disappearance of cash. Satoshi Nakamoto wanted crypto to be decentralized, but today’s push to create crypto ETFs goes against that wish. That’s why Unilabs deployed a massive DeFi ecosystem that would allow investors to access crypto assets like SOL faster and easier than through a Solana ETF. And the fund’s presale shows that investors are loving it! Unilabs has already attracted over 15k investors that bought $858k worth of UNIL – a record for AI presales and a number that could rival the daily inflows of a potential Solana ETF. Here’s why so many crypto natives are excited about Unilabs. SOL Investors Expect a Pullback as the Solana ETF is Delayed Once Again SOL is under short-term pressure, slipping below $170 as momentum cools amid uncertainty related to the Solana ETF. This week, the token is down 5% and has stayed under $180 for six days. This dip comes even as 65% of SOL’s supply is staked and Solana-based apps generated $1.2 billion in Q1 revenue. Technical indicators point to a cautious trend. SOL is trading inside the Ichimoku Cloud, with the conversion and baseline lines showing no clear direction. The BBTrend sits at -4.31, indicating ongoing bearish pressure. A potential EMA death cross adds further risk, and a drop below the $160 support could send the price toward $141. Regulatory uncertainty adds to the hesitation. The SEC has delayed decisions on Solana ETF filings from Bitwise and 21Shares, citing concerns about market manipulation. Dogecoin Expects Bullish Momentum Despite Whale Sell-Off Dogecoin is holding its bullish structure despite recent market volatility and a $40 million sell-off from whales. After gaining 44% over the past month, Dogecoin now trades at $0.2257. The memecoin’s recent 18% dip from its May 10 high is seen as a natural cooldown, not a trend reversal. Dogecoin’s technicals remain strong as well. A bull flag pattern is forming, typically a sign of continued upside. While whales have moved over 170 million Dogecoin, this looks more like profit-taking than a loss of confidence. Short-term momentum may be softer, but it’s helping to build a stronger foundation for further Dogecoin rallies. Over the last day, Dogecoin has stayed within an upward channel, with support around $0.218 and resistance at $0.234. Despite slipping slightly from $0.233 to $0.227, the higher low trend suggests solid buying interest. Unilabs Attracts Over 10k Investors With Powerful DeFi Ecosystem While analysts argue that crypto funds, like the Solana ETF, are good for Web3, crypto natives believe they are overly centralized and go against Satoshi Nakamoto’s principles. However, they are convenient and easy to invest in compared to most DeFi protocols and DEXs. That’s why traditional investors who want some crypto exposure are choosing them over the real thing. Unilabs works to change that, offering easy-to-access DeFi infrastructure for everyone. One of the fund’s flagship products is the Flash Loan Accelerator. This cutting-edge tool was created for top traders who need a lot of capital fast. Through a series of smart contracts, Unilabs’ Flash Loan Accelerator lets traders borrow liquidity without collateral as long as it gets repaid in the same blockchain transaction. The Flash Loan Accelerator now works together with other products, like the Cross-Chain Trading Hub, to offer a better alternative than the Solana ETF. With these tools, investors can invest in crypto without letting a big bank or an institutional player hold their tokens for them – enhancing security and financial freedom. Why Did Unilabs Need a Token? Just like any decentralized entity, Unilabs created a governance token that could let its holders vote on different initiatives and changes. This way, UNIL holders can now vote on key partnerships and more. But don’t think Unilabs’ UNIL is just a governance crypto token. The protocol has developed a unique reward-sharing strategy that transformed UNIL from a simple token to a passive income asset. Many analysts are now even comparing investing in UNIL to buying blue-chip stocks. That’s because the fund is distributing up to 30% of its revenue across token holders. Now priced at only $0.0051, UNIL will soon reach $0.0061 and further. That’s why today is the day to participate in the fund’s push toward decentralization!

On the other hand, BlackRock bought another 8000 BTC worth over $877 million, which is the largest inflow in May so far. According to reports, the retail traders haven’t started buying yet, which suggests there is more potential for an upswing. Meanwhile. Altcoins like Ethereum, XRP or Cardano have been coiling up at a reduced pace, due to which the beginning of an Altseason seems to have differed to some extent. Meanwhile, the market capitalisation, excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum, reflects the position of the Altseason. Currently, the levels have rebounded from a pivotal support range and are just 20% away from their highs. Moreover, the levels have risen above a pivotal resistance, and a close above the range could push the Altcoin market cap towards new highs. After the latest rise in the markets has elevated the levels above the conversion line initially, and later the baseline. If the levels continue to maintain a similar trend, the Ichimoku cloud could undergo a bullish crossover, which could push the levels towards the highs at $1.13 trillion. This could be when the Altseason 2025 could begin, elevating the altcoins to new highs. On the other hand, the Bitcoin dominance is yet again plunging after facing a rejection before recovering above 65%. This is another major indicator that the liquidity is flowing slightly from Bitcoin to altcoins. The BTC price is facing some upward pressure and a drop in value along with dominance may further fuel the altcoins. However, the Bitcoin price is required to hold between $105K to $108K, which could further trigger a strong Altseason in the second half of 2025.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/heres-where-the-bitcoin-btc-price-needs-to-reach-to-trigger-a-strong-altseason/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-05-23T08:56:50.000Z,"Bitcoin (BTC) Breaks Out: What's Next?","Bitcoin (BTC) surpassed its all-time high on Wednesday. However, since then the price has been fairly steady considering the breakout. Is this the pause before the rocket propellant is ignited? What could Bitcoin do next? Bitcoin will rise when it’s ready Many might have expected that once the Bitcoin bulls successfully pushed the price up and beyond the previous all-time high we would be off to the races. It is only two days later, but as it stands, this has not happened. Expectations are only the perceptions of what an individual or a group might have, and in regards to the market, they can often be the very opposite of what actually happens. Breakout and confirmation successful Source: TradingView The short-term 4-hour chart for $BTC shows that market behaviour is absolutely perfect so far. Once $BTC broke out of the big bull flag and the initial surge tailed off, the price crabbed along inside a rising channel for a few days. Breaking out of the top of this was a bullish move, and this led to the $109,000 all-time high being surpassed. What is important, is that once the breakout had occurred, the price returned to that level to confirm it before going higher again. Although it might still be quite tentative at this stage, the previous all-time high has now become the support platform for the next leg higher. The price could come back to this level, and even bounce along it for a time. Much will depend on whether the market has the momentum to go higher now rather than later. All has played out perfectly so far Source: TradingView Zooming out into the weekly time frame all is looking very rosy for the king of the cryptocurrencies. The previous high is now a tentative support, although the price will have to close above this level at the end of the week this Sunday in order for it to become confirmed support. The ascending trendline that stretches from both tops of the 2021 bull market has been respected during this bull market. It can be noted that the M candle pattern that formed above the ascending trendline played out perfectly by going to the exact measured move below the trendline. The W pattern that followed sent the price surging up and through the top of the bull flag. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI is signalling that the indicator lines are getting to the top, although there could be a lot more upside price momentum left yet. The 2-week Stochastic RSI is indicating even stronger upside price momentum. Right at the bottom of the chart, the MACD indicator line has crossed back above the signal line, while the green histogram bars have started to grow in size. Things could not be more bullish. Therefore it would appear that the probabilities are pointing to at least one more surge from Bitcoin that could take it into the end of 2025, and even into the first half of 2026. How far up it can go is anybody’s guess, but the Fibonacci extension levels, taken from the all-time high down to the lowest point of the bull flag, suggest that $131,000 could be a target.

2025-05-23T08:36:20.000Z,"More Bitcoin Gains Over the Weekend? Renewed Buyer Momentum Says So","Bitcoin surged to a fresh record high above $111,000 earlier this week, marking a strong recovery from its early April low of $75,000. This rally reflects a renewed appetite for risk among investors, and analysts believe the cryptocurrency could climb even higher. Buyers Return in Force Upon examining the Spot Taker Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) over a 90-day window, CryptoQuant analysts have observed a return to the “green” zone, indicating that taker buy orders are once again outpacing sell orders. This metric tracks the net difference between aggressive buyers and sellers in the spot market, and its recent turn upward signals renewed buying interest. For much of the past few months, the chart remained red, reflecting dominant selling pressure that coincided with price pullbacks. However, the current transition implies that buyers may be regaining control, which could support the case for continued price appreciation. As Bitcoin hovers near its new all-time high, the sustained strength in taker buy activity suggests market participants are not taking profits or stepping back. In fact, they appear to be stepping in. This renewed demand at historically high prices could pave the way for the next leg of the rally, which could potentially attract even more capital into the market. Topside Interest Rebuilds A similar sentiment was echoed by QCP Capital in its latest market update , which revealed that Bitcoin’s brief pullback post-ATH saw some investors locking in gains through puts, but demand on the upside quickly resumed. A key sign of this was the aggressive buying of 1,000 call contracts for September at the 130K strike, which is a cost-effective and strategic way to play a breakout. With a regulatory climate in the US becoming more favorable and institutional demand continuing through ETFs and spot exposure, the structural case for Bitcoin remains strong, as per the trading firm. On top of that, Strategy’s $2.1 billion sale of 10% Perpetual Preferred Stock to fund additional BTC acquisitions is expected to serve as a catalyst for further gains.

Attendees spent a combined $148 million to qualify for Trump’s exclusive crypto dinner. The event drew political backlash and protests over Trump’s growing ties to crypto. Tron founder Justin Sun has received a Trump-branded Golden Tourbillon watch for being the top holder of President Donald Trump’s memecoin. In a May 23 post on X , Sun revealed he was awarded a luxury Trump Golden Tourbillon watch during the exclusive dinner hosted by Donald Trump. The event, held at Trump’s private golf club in Virginia, gathered the top 220 $TRUMP memecoin holders. Sun, a known crypto billionaire and backer of Trump-linked projects, claimed the top spot among them. “President Trump said to me, ‘Everyone in this room got in so early. Our young team is destined to achieve great things,’” Sun wrote in a follow-up post, alongside images of the award ceremony. I was awarded a Trump Golden Tourbillon watch by Trump! pic.twitter.com/CCYGQ6FMPA — H.E. Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) May 23, 2025 Sun Leads as top Memecoin Buyers to Attend Trump Event The private dinner required an estimated $148 million in collective token purchases between April 23 and May 12 to qualify for entry, according to data from Inca Digital. The top 25 spenders, who contributed over $111 million, were granted access to a VIP reception and a private tour with the former president. The $TRUMP token’s website, managed by Fight Fight Fight LLC — an affiliate of the Trump Organization — listed the event perks. Alongside CIC Digital LLC, the Trump family controls 80% of the token supply, per on-chain data. Chainalysis reports that over $320 million in trading fees have flowed to wallets tied to the token’s creators since January. Former NBA star Lamar Odom was also among the top 220 buyers of the $TRUMP memecoin and qualified to attend the dinner. Ogle, a crypto investor known by this pseudonym, was also among the top 220 buyers who qualified for the event. Notably, Trump’s crypto ventures go beyond the memecoin. He and First Lady Melania Trump each have official tokens, while Trump Media’s financial arm, Truth.Fi, offers crypto ETFs. Eric Trump, meanwhile, co-founded a Bitcoin mining firm that’s preparing for a public listing. Justin Sun’s ties to the Trump crypto orbit are extensive. The Tron founder is also the biggest backer of World Liberty Financial (WLF), a crypto venture led by Zach Witkoff, son of Trump’s Middle East envoy. Sun invested $75 million in the firm and purchased $30 million worth of its tokens during the launch. Political Blowback and Legal Clouds The event drew criticism from lawmakers . Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) called Trump’s crypto ventures a “personal money-making machine,” while Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) admitted the optics “give me pause.” A group of Democrats is holding a press conference to address potential conflicts of interest. Furthermore, roughly 100 demonstrators gathered outside the Trump National Golf Club in Virginia as guests arrived. Protesters held signs reading “America is not for sale” and “Stop Crypto Corruption” while chanting “Shame!” as attendees emerged from their cars near the club’s security checkpoint. Some shouted, “I hope you choke on your dinner,” while others carried props, including a gold coin with Trump’s face and placards demanding the guest list be made public.

2025-05-23T08:30:25.000Z,"Can Dogecoin Really Hit $3.80? Analyst Says Yes—If This Happens","Dogecoin’s latest market structure is “significantly better than in prior bull markets,” according to Kevin, the crypto technician known on X and YouTube as @Kev_Capital_TA. In a video released Friday, the analyst mapped Dogecoin’s three historical cycles, concluding that the memecoin’s current breakout-and-retest pattern places a long-term Fibonacci extension at $3.80–$3.90 squarely “on the table”—provided one key condition holds: Bitcoin must keep grinding higher. “Two cycles in a row, Dogecoin has tagged the 1.618 fib extension,” Kevin reminded viewers. “Here we are in the third cycle… we have evidence to suggest it has happened 100% of the time. It’s only two data points, though, so that could easily not happen this time.” Why $3.80 Per Dogecoin Is Possible This Cycle On a log-scale weekly chart, Kevin traced Dogecoin’s first super-cycle—consolidation, breakout, mid-cycle pullback, blow-off top—culminating at the 1.618 extension. The second cycle repeated the pattern, but “Elon Musk’s Saturday Night Live hype” punched price far beyond the fib target into euphoric territory. Today’s third cycle, he argued, looks healthier: successive breakouts and back-tests of the bear-market range have carved a rising channel of higher highs and higher lows anchored by the 200-week EMA/SMA cluster. “This structure looks really good to me… break out, back-test the 200s, make a higher low—it’s textbook.” On the monthly chart, the Relative Strength Index is “just strength—constant higher lows,” still far beneath the 80-to-90 zone that capped prior cycle tops. Kevin also flagged a V-shaped curl in the monthly Stoch RSI—a signal that “should provide the momentum we need to really get a durable run higher” once it crosses the 20 line. Related Reading: Dogecoin To $1 Is ‘Absolutely’ On The Table This Cycle, Says Analyst The two-week Market Cipher readout shows three years of progressively stronger momentum waves and money-flow inflows. “This is big-time stuff,” he said, circling each expansion. “Momentum is compressing and building to a point where it’s like, okay, now it’s time to release it.” A fresh two-week Stoch RSI cross historically precedes “bang, big move higher,” he added, implying that the post-halving phase could usher in Dogecoin’s next parabolic leg. For traders fixated on nearer horizons, Kevin highlighted a macro golden pocket stretching from $0.26 to $0.285, reinforced by the daily 200-SMA at $0.27. That zone caps a developing bull-flag whose measured move targets $0.32–0.33. The pattern sprang out of an inverse head-and-shoulders accumulation at $0.15, a level he “accumulated heavily,” now up roughly 60%. “Treat resistance as resistance until it isn’t,” he cautioned, noting that Bitcoin dominance near 64% still siphons liquidity from altcoins. Yet he sees “serious signs” that dominance has printed a local top at 65.45%, opening room for a rotation into majors like Ethereum and, by proxy, Dogecoin. This Needs To Happen If Bitcoin stability endures and macro conditions—softening inflation, steady labor data, potential Fed easing—remain supportive, Kevin’s next “main price target” is the 2021 all-time high just under $1.00. A decisive break there would turn eyes to the cycle’s 1.618 extension near $3.80. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bollinger Squeeze Signals ‘Huge Move’ Ahead, Analyst Warns “I’d be shocked at this point if we don’t go to that level,” he said, while stressing disciplined profit-taking: “There’s nothing worse than riding a move all the way up and not taking profits.” Kevin rebuffed the wilder six-and-seven-dollar predictions circulating on social media but insisted that a $3-plus Dogecoin is “absolutely possible” if Bitcoin pushes toward $200,000, quantitative tightening ends, and a full-blown altcoin season erupts. Dogecoin remains “one of the most popular cryptocurrencies on the planet,” the analyst observed. “When retail comes piling back in, they’re always piling back into Dogecoin.” That psychological feedback loop, combined with a structurally bullish chart and improving momentum gauges, underpins his conviction that the memecoin could reprise its role as the spearhead of a broader altcoin surge. Whether the market delivers the necessary macro tailwinds is the wildcard. But Kevin’s message was unambiguous: for now, Dogecoin’s technical canvas paints a credible route to $1, and the elusive $3.80 marker “is possible—if Bitcoin holds ground and the macro stays peachy.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.243.

Online banks, he said, spend about $20 to $30. In contrast, DeFi requires almost nothing beyond a smartphone and internet access.“Onboarding to DeFi literally costs zero,” Bukov said. “You don’t need brick-and-mortar infrastructure or lengthy verification processes. Just connect and transact.” Bukov said that this gives DeFi an edge over traditional financial institutions in reaching the 1.4 billion unbanked people who remain excluded from traditional finance due to high onboarding expenses.1inch Network co-founder Anton Bukov at the Dutch Blockchain Week. Source: CointelegraphReaching 1.4 billion unbanked users“That’s why we have 1.4 billion people on the planet who are unbanked. No one’s going to invest those hundreds or tens of dollars into them because they will never return to them,” Bukov added. Unlike traditional finance, which has high barriers to entry, Bukov said DeFi allows the unbanked to become a part of the global economy and engage in real-life transactions using stablecoins like Tether’s USDt (USDT). With lower barriers to entry, DeFi becomes a tool for financial inclusion. Bukov said DeFi will continue to reach users who never had access to traditional banking as internet access expands globally. “You can just get a phone, access to the internet, and you can exchange your chicken for USDT,” Bukov said, highlighting how easily DeFi enables participation in the global economy. Related: Animoca’s Yat Siu says student loans can supercharge DeFi growthDeFi allows access to global liquidity Apart from financial inclusion, Bukov said that the real value of crypto lies in how it gives access to global liquidity. The 1inch co-founder said crypto is evolving into an independent economic zone, where hundreds of billions flow through decentralized protocols. “Crypto isn’t just about adopting stablecoins or building national digital currencies,” Bukov said. “It’s a growing global liquidity hub.”He said that this liquidity is dynamic and allows financial experimentation, yield strategies and cross-border capital movement. Bukov added that countries that align their regulations to enable easier access to this global liquidity can tap into economic opportunities and cooperation. “The more countries trade with each other, the more they succeed.

2025-05-23T08:25:00.000Z,"Why Tether refuses to comply with MiCA","Is Tether MiCA compliant?              The EU’s new Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation, better known as MiCA, is the first major attempt by a global economic power to create clear, region-wide rules for the crypto space, and stablecoins are a big focus.MiCA mandates best practices. If a stablecoin is going to be traded in the EU, its issuer has to follow some stringent rules:1. You need a licenseTo issue a stablecoin in Europe, you must become a fully authorized electronic money institution (EMI). That’s the same kind of license traditional fintechs need to offer e-wallets or prepaid cards. It’s not cheap and it’s not quick. 2. Most of your reserves have to sit in European banksThis is one of the most controversial parts of MiCA. If you issue a “significant” stablecoin — and Tether’s USDT certainly qualifies — at least 60% of your reserves must be held in EU-based banks. The logic is to keep the financial system safe. 3. Full transparency is non-negotiableMiCA requires detailed, regular disclosures. Issuers have to publish a white paper and provide updates on their reserves, audits and operational changes. This level of reporting is new territory for some stablecoins, especially those that have historically avoided public scrutiny.4. Non-compliant coins are getting delistedIf a token doesn’t comply, it won’t be tradable on regulated EU platforms. Binance, for example, has delisted USDT trading pairs for users in the European Economic Area (EEA). Other exchanges are following suit.The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) clarified that people in Europe can still hold or transfer USDT, but it can’t be offered to the public or listed on official venues. In other words, you might still have USDT in your wallet, but good luck trying to swap it on a regulated platform.                  Key reasons why Tether rejects MiCA regulations              Tether is unique in that it has explained why it wants nothing to do with MiCA regulations. The company’s leadership, especially CEO Paolo Ardoino, has been pretty vocal about what they see as serious flaws in the regulation, from financial risks to privacy concerns to the bigger picture of who stablecoins are really for.1. The banking rule could backfireOne of MiCA’s most talked-about rules says that “significant” stablecoins — like Tether’s USDt (USDT) — must keep at least 60% of their reserves in European banks. The idea is to make stablecoins safer and more transparent. But Ardoino sees it differently.He’s warned that this could create new problems, forcing stablecoin issuers to rely so heavily on traditional banks could make the whole system more fragile. After all, if there’s a wave of redemptions and those banks don’t have enough liquidity to keep up, we’d witness a struggling bank and a stablecoin crisis simultaneously.Instead, Tether prefers to keep most of its reserves in US Treasurys, assets it says are liquid, low-risk and much easier to redeem quickly if needed.2. They don’t trust the digital euroTether also has a broader issue with the direction Europe is heading, especially regarding a digital euro. Ardoino has openly criticized it, raising alarms about privacy. He has argued that a centrally controlled digital currency could be used to track how people spend their money, and even control or restrict transactions if someone falls out of favor with the system.Privacy advocates have echoed similar concerns. While the European Central Bank insists that privacy is a top priority (with features like offline payments), Tether isn’t convinced. In their eyes, putting that much financial power in the hands of one institution is asking for trouble.3. Tether’s users aren’t in Brussels. They’re in Brazil, Turkey and NigeriaAt the heart of it, Tether sees itself as a lifeline for people in countries dealing with inflation, unstable banking systems and limited access to dollars. These are places like Turkey, Argentina and Nigeria, where USDT is often more useful than the local currency.MiCA, with all its licensing hoops and reserve mandates, would require Tether to shift focus and invest heavily in meeting EU-specific standards. That’s something the company says it’s not willing to do, not at the expense of the markets it sees as most in need of financial tools like USDT.Did you know? Turkey ranks among the top countries for cryptocurrency adoption, with 16% of its population engaged in crypto activities. This high adoption rate is largely driven by the devaluation of the Turkish lira and economic instability, prompting citizens to seek alternatives like stablecoins to preserve their purchasing power.                  What happens when Tether doesn’t comply with MiCA              Tether’s decision to skip MiCA didn’t exactly fly under the radar. It’s already having real consequences, especially for exchanges and users in Europe.Exchanges are dropping USDTBig names like Binance and Kraken didn’t wait around. To stay on the right side of EU regulators, they’ve already delisted USDT trading pairs for users in the European Economic Area. Binance had removed them by the end of March 2025. Kraken followed close behind, removing not just USDT but also other non-compliant stablecoins like EURT and PayPal’s PYUSD.Users are left with fewer optionsIf you’re in Europe and holding USDT, you’re not totally out of luck; you can still withdraw or swap it on certain platforms. But you won’t be trading it on major exchanges anymore. That’s already pushing users toward alternatives like USDC and EURC, which are fully MiCA-compliant and widely supported.Even major crypto payment processors are pulling support, leaving users with fewer options for spending their crypto directly.A hit to liquidity? Probably.Pulling USDT from European exchanges could make the markets a bit shakier. Less liquidity, wider spreads and more volatility during big price moves are all on the table. Some traders will adjust quickly. Others? Not so much.Did you know? Tether (USDT) is the most traded cryptocurrency globally, surpassing even Bitcoin in daily volume. In 2024, it facilitated over $20.6 trillion in transactions and boasts a user base exceeding 400 million worldwide.                  Tether vs MiCA regulation              Tether may be out of sync with the EU, but it’s far from retreating. If anything, the company is doubling down elsewhere, looking for friendlier ground and broader horizons.Firstly, Tether’s picked El Salvador as its new base, a country that has fully embraced crypto. After getting a digital asset service provider license, the company is setting up a real headquarters there. Ardoino and other top execs are making the move too.Moreover, after banking over $5 billion in profits in early 2024, Tether is putting its capital to work:AI: Through its venture arm, Tether Evo, the company has picked up stakes in firms like Northern Data Group and Blackrock Neurotech. Tether has also launched Tether AI, an open-source, decentralized AI platform designed to operate on any device without centralized servers or API keys. The goal is to use AI to boost operations and maybe build some new tools along the way.Infrastructure and AgTech: Tether invested in Adecoagro, a company focused on sustainable farming and renewable energy. It’s a surprising move, but it fits Tether’s bigger strategy of backing real-world, resilient systems.Media and beyond: There are also signs Tether wants a footprint in content and communications, signaling it’s thinking far beyond crypto alone.                  Tether’s MiCA exit highlights crypto’s global regulatory chaos              Tether walking away from MiCA is a snapshot of a much bigger issue in crypto: How hard it is to build a business in a world where every jurisdiction plays by its own rulebook.The classic game of regulatory arbitrageThis isn’t Tether’s first rodeo when it comes to navigating regulations. Like many crypto companies, they’ve mastered the art of regulatory arbitrage, finding the friendliest jurisdiction and setting up shop there. Europe brings in strict rules? Fine, Tether sets up in El Salvador, where crypto is welcomed with open arms.However, it does raise questions. If big players can simply move jurisdictions to dodge regulations, how effective are those rules in the first place? And does that leave retail users protected or just further confused?A crypto world that’s all over the mapThe bigger issue is that the global regulatory landscape is incredibly fragmented. Europe wants full compliance, transparency and reserve mandates. The US is still sending mixed signals. Asia is split; Hong Kong is pro-crypto, while China stays cold. Hong Kong has also passed the Stablecoin Bill to license fiat-backed issuers and boost its Web3 ambitions. Meanwhile, Latin America is embracing crypto as a tool for financial access.For companies, it’s a mess. You can’t build for one global market; you must constantly adapt, restructure or pull out entirely. For users, it creates massive gaps in access. A coin available in one country might be inaccessible in another just because of local policy.As a final thought: Tether’s resistance to MiCA seems to be more than just a protest against red tape. It’s making a bet that crypto’s future will be shaped outside Brussels, not inside it.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/why-tether-refuses-to-comply-with-mica?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

It’s an increase of 30% since the start of May as derivatives speculators load up on leverage in anticipation of higher Bitcoin prices.Open interest is the total number of outstanding futures contracts that allow traders to bet on the future price of Bitcoin, which have not been settled or closed, showing the total amount of current market speculation.Total Bitcoin futures OI. Source: CoinglassWhen OI surges, it indicates massive leveraged positions are built up in the market, with lots of traders holding large positions with borrowed money. If Bitcoin’s price moves against these over-leveraged positions, traders get forcibly liquidated, and the flushout can create selling pressure on Bitcoin, which can cause a rapid drop in prices and high volatility.However, analysts suggest the surge in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows, which have seen more than $2.5 billion this week, can counter some of that extended leverage.Related: Crypto perp futures coming ‘very soon,’ says CFTC’s MersingerBitcoin options markets show a similar pattern with open interest over $1.5 billion at the $110,000 and $120,000 strike prices on the Deribit exchange.

2025-05-23T05:11:25.000Z,"Trendspotting in crypto: How to discover winning projects before the crowd","TL;DRSpotting the next big crypto project before it explodes demands data, discipline and a sharp eye for real signals. This guide explores how to identify early winners by analyzing onchain metrics, tokenomics, dev activity and community traction while avoiding the common traps of hype-driven pumps and red-flag projects.Despite the crypto space being crowded, fast-moving and full of noise, some investors manage to consistently find promising projects while they’re still under the radar.So, how do they do it? Crypto trendspotters know how to read onchain data. They understand tokenomics. They read GitHub commits and follow the money. It takes more than jumping on the hype bandwagon ahead of the crowd.This guide breaks down how to find crypto projects with real potential using lessons from past winners like Solana, Arbitrum, Chainlink and even memecoins like Pepe. Along the way, it will highlight the tools that matter, red flags to avoid and the difference between organic growth and manufactured buzz.How the real winners took offSolanaWhen Solana launched in 2020, few outside of developer circles had heard of it. But it had one big edge: speed. Solana’s proof-of-history tech made it one of the fastest chains around, and it quickly became a magnet for builders, especially in DeFi and NFTs. By 2021, its ecosystem exploded with apps like Serum and Magic Eden.Early adopters who paid attention to onchain growth — like wallet activity and DEX volume — could see something brewing. Solana (SOL) went from under $1 to $50+ in less than a year. Arbitrum Arbitrum launched in 2021 as an Ethereum layer 2, but its big moment came with the Arbitrum (ARB) token airdrop in March 2023. At launch, Arbitrum was already processing more transactions than many layer 1s and had billions in total value locked (TVL) in decentralized applications (DApps).Smart investors were watching. Even before the token, the signs were there: user activity, rising liquidity and growing app adoption. When ARB dropped, the pump stuck because the foundation was real.ChainlinkChainlink is a classic example of a project with long-term utility. It doesn’t have flashy branding or meme power, but it does one thing incredibly well: feed real-world data into smart contracts.By 2024, it had become the backbone of much of DeFi, gaming and even tokenized real-world assets. If you were watching closely in 2019-2020, you saw LINK (LINK) getting integrated everywhere. That kind of early utility often flies under the radar — until price action catches up.PEPE Coin (PEPE)Let’s not pretend memes don’t matter. Pepe (PEPE) launched in 2023 with no roadmap, no utility and no VC backing. But it hit a nerve, and the internet ran with it. The coin hit a billion-dollar market cap within weeks.That kind of run is rare — and risky. But for traders tracking social sentiment, wallet distribution and community activity, the early signals were all there. PEPE didn’t promise anything, but it delivered returns by becoming a viral moment.How to find crypto gems earlySo, how do you separate the next Solana from the next rug pull? Here’s how serious trendspotters approach it.1. Start with onchain metricsPublic blockchains are transparent. Use that to look at:Daily active walletsTransaction volumeTokenholder growthLiquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs)TVL (for DeFi projects).If users and capital are moving in — before the token moons — that’s a great sign. Tools like Dune Analytics, Nansen and DefiLlama are your best friends here.2. Understand the tokenomicsAsk questions like:What’s the total supply? How much is circulating?Are there upcoming unlocks or vesting cliffs?Who holds the tokens, and how concentrated are the top wallets?Is there utility? Does the token do anything?Tokens with capped supply, smart incentives (like staking or burn mechanisms) and fair distribution models tend to do better long-term.3. Check developer activityIs the team actually building?GitHub is a goldmine. Look at how often code is pushed, how many contributors are active, and whether the repo looks alive. No updates for months? Big red flag.You don’t need to read code — just track commits and releases. Projects with real traction are always shipping.4. Look for ecosystem signalsAre other developers building on top of it? Are DApps launching? Is liquidity growing? Are users coming back week after week?Ecosystem growth is hard to fake, and it’s often the strongest early indicator that a project has legs.5. Follow the communityX, Discord, Telegram, Reddit — yes, it’s noisy. But it’s also where trends start. Look beyond the price talk:Are people actually using the product?Are devs answering questions?Is the tone constructive or just hype?Use LunarCrush or Santiment to track social momentum, but always double-check it with onchain data.Key tools to spot crypto trendsHere’s a quick rundown of the top platforms used by smart crypto trendspotters:Top tip: Don’t just use one tool. Great traders cross-reference everything.Crypto trend analysis 2025A coin might be flying, but is it because people are actually using it or just talking about it? Learning to tell the difference can save you from making a bad investment. Signs of real tractionSteady user growth and TVL over time: If users are showing up before a token pumps — and the numbers keep climbing week over week — that’s usually a sign of substance. You’ll often see this in DeFi protocols or layer 2s gaining trust slowly, not overnight.Code commits and product updates: A live GitHub with regular commits, active devs and visible progress means the team is building. This shows momentum and long-term focus — not just a marketing push.More tokenholders, less whale control: When new holders join steadily — and supply isn’t all locked up by the top five wallets — it’s a healthier setup. Distributed ownership reduces the risk of rug pulls or coordinated dumps.New integrations and ecosystem activity: If other apps are integrating the token or building on the protocol, it usually means the tech is solid and useful. This kind of network effect compounds fast and often precedes a breakout.Liquidity that builds slowly: Gradual increases in liquidity and trading volume tend to reflect real interest. If liquidity sticks around (rather than vanishing after a pump), it’s usually organic.Signs of manufactured hypeSudden spikes in social mentions or trading volume with no news: If the project is everywhere on X overnight, but there’s no product update, launch or roadmap shift, be skeptical. It’s likely a coordinated shill.Influencer spam and recycled talking points: When you see multiple anonymous influencers posting the same meme or catchphrase, that’s a signal someone’s trying to manufacture buzz.No dev activity or roadmap: If there’s no GitHub, no changelog and the team isn’t shipping anything, it’s probably just a hype machine.Anonymous team, outrageous promises: Combine a mystery team with claims like “100x guaranteed,” and you’re likely looking at a cash grab. Real builders let the work speak for itself.Rule of thumb: If the price is moving and everything else — users, devs, integrations — is standing still, you’re looking at hype. But when those fundamentals are quietly ticking up in the background? That’s when it’s worth a closer look.More red flagsSome projects look great on the surface — slick websites, trending hashtags, a fast-moving chart — but fall apart under the hood. Here are some more red flags to watch out for:High holder concentration: If most of the token is sitting in a handful of wallets, it doesn’t take much for a price crash. Whales often buy early and dump on retail.Unverified token contracts: A token that hasn’t been verified on Etherscan or BscScan might hide functions that allow minting, blocking wallets or draining liquidity. Always check the contract or look for an audit.No liquidity lock or audit: If the devs control all the liquidity provider tokens and there’s no lock or time-locked contract, they can pull the rug at any moment. Similarly, no third-party audit? That’s a gamble.Big token unlocks coming up: Large unlocks for insiders or early investors can trigger huge sell-offs. If you’re holding during a major vesting event, you could be exit liquidity. Know the schedule.Top tip: Before you click buy, ask, Who stands to gain the most if this pumps? Who gets hurt if it dumps? If the answer points to a few insiders with heavy bags and zero accountability, walk away.How to spot crypto trends before the crowdThe best early investors are the mechanics looking under the hood. They study token structures and unlock schedules, join communities early to catch signals firsthand, and follow the builders to see who’s actually shipping. Most importantly, they cross-check everything: on-chain data, social sentiment, developer activity, and liquidity. Tools like Dune, DefiLlama, Nansen and GitHub help them separate noise from substance — and spot winners before the crowd does.Crypto rewards those who are curious, critical and a little bit contrarian. The crowd usually shows up late. If you want to find gems before they moon, you’ll need to think independently, dig deeper, and act before the narrative forms.It’s not easy. But it’s doable. And the more you practice spotting early signals — the real ones, not the noise — the more second nature it becomes.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The proposed amendment would come after 18 Democrats sided with Republicans in the Senate in voting to advance the bill on May 20 after it failed a procedural vote on May 8.“Passing the GENIUS Act without our anti-corruption amendment stamps a Congressional seal of approval on Trump selling access and influence to the highest bidder,” Merkley said in a May 22 X post.Trump his three sons are involved in the crypto platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI), which launched its USD1 stablecoin in March.

Far from being bearish, the current level leaves room for bullish positioning on XRP futures markets.Related: Which senators invest in crypto? 11 lawmakers have blockchain-related investmentsFavorable regulation opens the door for new partnerships and acquisitionsPart of the limited XRP price upside can be explained by the multiple rejections of US Senator Cynthia Lummis, Chair of the US Congress Digital Assets Subcommittee, to meet Ripple representatives. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse asked on May 19 that the lawmaker “reconsider and be a leader for ALL of crypto,” and discuss “how to make the US the crypto capital of the world.”There is nothing stopping XRP from hitting $3.50 or even higher, as Ripple Labs is no longer facing direct threats from regulators, which paves the way for partnerships and acquisitions.

Ives simply referred to them as a “new design movement” that would be similar to Apple’s family of hardware and software integrations. OpenAI has raised billions of dollars from investors, who view the company as a stalwart in the AI industry following the overwhelming success of its ChatGPT large language model (LLM). As of May, ChatGPT had nearly 800 million weekly active users, according to industry data. These usage trends were behind OpenAI’s massive $157 billion valuation as of October 2024 — a figure that nearly doubled to $300 billion by March 2025.ChatGPT usage trends.

With Bitcoin (BTC) hitting an all-time high, market speculators are banking on eventual capital rotation, which could pump major altcoins like SOL toward new highs.Solana shows promising signs on the daily chart, forming a textbook bull flag pattern after a strong uptrend. While SOL prices currently trade under $180, a breakout above this level could propel SOL toward its first target at $200, with further upside potential to $220 if momentum sustains.Solana 1-day chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe trend remains bullish, supported by the relative strength index (RSI) at 64.30, indicating healthy momentum without overbought conditions. However, SOL needs a clear market structure break (MSB) or a decisive bullish breakout above $180 to trigger the next leg of the rally. Declining volumes during the consolidation phase suggest caution, as a lack of buying pressure could stall the breakout. If SOL fails to breach $180, the immediate key area of interest is between $140-150, and the bull flag pattern would be invalidated.

2025-05-22T15:00:00.000Z,"Semiconductor exemptions don’t matter when it comes to tariffs","Opinion by: Ahmad Shadid of O.xyzSemiconductors scored a rare exemption from US President Donald Trump’s aggressive reciprocal tariffs, but the relief is symbolic at best. Most semiconductors enter the US embedded in servers, GPUs, laptops, and smartphones. The finished goods remain heavily tariffed, some with duties reaching up to 49%. The exemption looks good politically but delivers little practical benefit. Nvidia’s DGX systems, crucial for training advanced AI models, do not fall under the exempted HTS codes. Nvidia could pay effective tariffs nearing 40% on these vital components. Such costs threaten to stall critical AI infrastructure projects across the country. Semiconductor tariffs may compromise the goal of the CHIPS Act. The act promised tens of billions of dollars in subsidies to support domestic chip manufacturing. Yet advanced lithography machines — key equipment from countries like the Netherlands and Japan — face 20%–24% tariffs. Ironically, tariffs designed to boost American production increase the cost of essential manufacturing equipment.The effect of new tariffs is already slowing progress in critical supply chains — just as generative AI and large language models are gaining momentum across sectors like finance and defense. Any delays or cost increases now could blunt America’s technological advantage.Indirect costs undermine exemptions for AIModern semiconductor supply chains are global and highly integrated. An exemption on raw silicon means nothing when servers, GPUs and other finished products face steep tariffs. Tariffs indirectly inflate costs, eliminating any competitive advantage from domestic manufacturing.Indirect tariff costs hit high-end systems disproportionately hard. The effect ripples through AI model training, data center expansions and major infrastructure projects, significantly slowing the industry’s momentum.Tariff impasse halts investmentSo far, it’s clear that the US president’s tariff plan didn’t follow any conventional economic trends or calculated strategy. The uncertain tariff situation stalls investment decisions across the technology sector. Companies need predictable costs to justify large capital expenditures. Ongoing tariff volatility prevents them from committing resources to new data centers and manufacturing lines.This mirrors the supply chain chaos of 2020. At that time, uncertainty caused massive order cancellations and slowed industry recovery for years. If tariff ambiguity continues, we could see similar waves of cancellations in 2025. This would further compound existing inventory and revenue issues in the semiconductor sector.Domestic production is not optimalThe border argument for these tariffs is that they’re meant to boost domestic production. They do little, however, to encourage genuine domestic semiconductor production. Despite subsidies under the CHIPS Act, most US semiconductor companies still rely on international foundries for manufacturing. Instead, they face increased equipment and operational costs.Recent: How trade wars impact stocks and cryptoThe idea that tariffs promote domestic production ignores the reality of global semiconductor manufacturing. Costs rise across the board, putting American companies at a disadvantage rather than offering protection.AI projects face heightened riskThe blockchain and crypto sectors, particularly AI-driven projects, also feel the pinch. Projects depend heavily on GPUs and high-performance servers for mining, validating transactions and running decentralized AI computations. Increased hardware costs directly affect profitability and growth, potentially stalling innovation in blockchain applications. AI developments have just started to pick up the pace in the blockchain and Web3 space. The industry saw increased interest from investors and VCs just a year ago. So, they are still on tighter budgets. Elevated costs can, however, lead to stagnation. We might see innovators and developers exiting the market. The ripple effect extends beyond the general technology sector and could threaten future digital economies. Moreover, these cost pressures disproportionately affect startups and smaller tech firms. Industry giants can absorb additional expenses, but innovative, smaller players face existential threats. This dynamic risks stifling innovation at the grassroots level, harming the entire tech ecosystem.What to expect Semiconductors have momentarily escaped direct tariffs, but the exemption provides little benefit. Tariffs continue to hit finished products, driving up indirect costs across the industry. Instead of boosting domestic manufacturing, these tariffs create economic paralysis, stall critical infrastructure projects, and threaten America’s lead in AI innovation. Policymakers must acknowledge these realities and adjust their approach before irreversible damage is done to the nation’s technological future.Opinion by: Ahmad Shadid of O.xyz.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-22T13:39:15.000Z,"Exponential currency debasement: ‘You don’t own enough crypto, NFTs’","Cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can help investors protect their eroding purchasing power during an era of exponential currency debasement, according to analysts and industry leaders.Investing in digital assets is becoming increasingly important in the “world of the exponential age and currency debasement,” according to Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Global Macro Investor.“You don’t own enough crypto. When you do, you don’t own enough NFT’s, as art is upstream of wealth. Both will never be this cheap again,” Pal said.NFTs are “the single best long term store of wealth I know and you get to buy it before network effects kick in,” he added in another response.Source: Raoul Pal“There is some validity to the statement that NFTs, and in extension art, become a vehicle for the wealthy once a certain level of wealth is reached,” wrote Nicolai Sondergaard, research analyst at Nansen, calling it a “natural move” for asset diversification.“For traders and investors, further down the wealth curve, NFTs are partially about speculating on future returns,” he told Cointelegraph, adding that NFTs also benefit from the allure of strong communities, beyond just wealth creation.Related: German gov’t missed out on $2.3B profit after selling Bitcoin at $57KArt NFTs may see a resurgence as “digital ownership gains acceptance among younger, tech-savvy cohorts,” if collections manage to move past the “speculative fervor,” according to Anndy Lian, author and intergovernmental blockchain expert.Still, Lian said broader adoption depends on blockchain networks improving scalability and security to “instill confidence.” He added that art NFTs “must transcend hype, anchoring value in cultural significance or utility.”  Beeple’s “Everydays: The First 5000 Days.” Source: ChristiesSome digital artists made millions of dollars through NFTs.

2025-05-22T13:30:00.000Z,"How staking incentivizes trust without burning energy","What if a financial system could run itself not by burning electricity, but by rewarding good behavior? That’s the promise of staking, a mechanism that powers many modern blockchains by turning users into network operators. In this week’s episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Gareth Jenkinson and Nathan Jeffay sit down with StarkWare’s Noam Nisan to unpack how this trustless engine works, why it matters and what’s really at stake.Understanding stakingJeffay began by highlighting how staking is part of the backbone that keeps the blockchain running, and runs itself, with volunteers.“By doing this, they’re saying, OK, we’re taking this task of running the blockchain seriously. Here's some of our money. We're putting it down. We're showing that we're serious about doing this.”To help unpack this topic further and examine the deeper mechanics behind staking, the hosts are joined by Noam Nisan, principal researcher at StarkWare and a widely respected computer scientist who has held roles at Google and Princeton.Related: How to handle crypto trading gains and losses on your balance sheet“So we have this general system with operators... Why would they want to do that? The system, the protocol, incentivizes them to actually run the system,” Nisan explained. “Basically, it can give them tokens for operating the system.”Staking offers what Nisan describes as two distinct types of security: computer science-based guarantees and economic disincentives for bad actors. “If a majority or supermajority, maybe two-thirds of the parties of the token of the staked amount are behaving properly... we can prove that the system acts correctly,” he said. “But you also have what I would call an economic guarantee... if they destroy the system, very likely the value of the token... will go down. So they are the one losing.”PoW vs PoSJenkinson, a vocal Bitcoin (BTC) supporter, posed the classic comparison: proof-of-work vs proof-of-stake. “Do you have any strong feelings about one or the other?” he asked.“The truth is that it’s not clear.. it's really a social question, I think.”Nisan noted that both mechanisms involve trade-offs around cost, control, and decentralization. The episode also explores the role of staking in tokenomics and system design. Nisan unpacks how fee mechanics and inflation controls, such as Ethereum’s minting curve, help keep the ecosystem in balance.To hear the full conversation on The Clear Crypto Podcast,  listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

Fueled by BTC’s rally, several high-risk tokens are posting even larger gains, stoking possibilities that they could continue to outperform Bitcoin as the crypto bull run accelerates.Fartcoin ascending channel hints at more gainsSolana-based Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) memecoin has surged 30% in the last three days to hit $1.57 as of May 22, its highest level in the last four months.The rally extends Fartcoin’s strong year-to-date (YTD) performance—up 74.50%—amid the ongoing memecoin frenzy.

It is, therefore, underperforming Bitcoin on a YTD timeframe but, like WIF, shows the potential of outperforming BTC this cycle in percentage terms.At the core of this bullish outlook is SPX6900’s ongoing bullish reversal attempts.

2025-05-22T12:38:44.000Z,"UK court partially dismisses Bitcoin SV investor’s lawsuit against Binance","The United Kingdom’s Court of Appeal has partially dismissed a lawsuit brought by Bitcoin SV investors against major crypto exchanges, including Binance, for allegedly conspiring to delist the token in 2019.In a judgment handed down on May 21, the court ruled that investors who held BSV through the delisting period (classified as “sub-class B”) were not entitled to billions in speculative damages based on BSV’s hypothetical growth.These investors had claimed over 8.9 billion British pounds ($11.9 billion) in damages, asserting that Binance’s delisting deprived holders of the chance to profit from BSV’s potential rise to a “top-tier cryptocurrency” like Bitcoin (BTC) or Bitcoin Cash (BCH).The court rejected this “foregone growth effect” theory, stating, “BSV was obviously not a unique cryptocurrency without reasonably similar substitutes,” pointing to the representative’s own use of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash as comparators.Sub-class B’s central claim was that delisting led to a missed opportunity to benefit from price appreciation. However, the court determined that those investors had ample chance to mitigate losses by selling or reinvesting in other crypto assets.“They had a duty to mitigate their losses,” wrote Master of the Rolls Sir Geoffrey Vos. “They cannot recover losses that they could reasonably have mitigated.”UK court ruling against Bitcoin SV investor’s lawsuit. Source: CaselawRelated: Bitcoin SV investors attempt to resurrect 2019 Binance lawsuitCourt strikes down “loss of a chance” argumentThe appeal also challenged the Tribunal’s application of the “market mitigation rule,” arguing that such issues should be left for trial.The court dismissed that notion, stating the rule clearly applies to freely tradable assets like BSV, and that the damages must be measured shortly after the delisting.An additional argument concerning the “loss of a chance” to benefit from future price gains was also struck down. The court ruled it “flawed as a matter of principle,” noting that “cryptocurrencies are, by their nature, volatile investments.”Binance’s limited strike-out application ultimately succeeded, with the court stating that even if some holders were unaware of the delisting, “they could never claim more than the total value of their holding before the delisting events plus any quantifiable consequential losses.”Related: Binance wants arbitration for all members of securities class suitBinance seeks to dismiss FTX lawsuitOn May 16, Binance filed a motion to dismiss a $1.76 billion lawsuit filed by the FTX estate, arguing that the claims are legally flawed and an attempt to shift responsibility for FTX’s collapse.The exchange stated the downfall of FTX stemmed from internal fraud, not external manipulation, citing Sam Bankman-Fried’s conviction on multiple fraud charges.Binance has asked the court to dismiss all claims with prejudice.

2025-05-22T10:21:18.000Z,"Can ChatGPT-powered AI agents really trade crypto for you?","Key takeawaysChatGPT-powered AI agents automate trading tasks using natural language prompts and API integrations, improving speed and consistency.Successes occur when ChatGPT is used as a support tool, not a fully autonomous trading system.Failures happen when traders over-rely on ChatGPT without real-time data, proper risk management or manual oversight.Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance.What if a crypto trader didn’t need to constantly check charts, worry about emotions, or stay up all night watching for sudden price swings? What if those tasks could be handled by an intelligent agent that understands instructions in plain English — and reacts within milliseconds? That’s where ChatGPT-powered AI agents come in.These tools combine natural language processing with real-time trading logic to automate decision-making in one of the world’s most volatile markets. From rebalancing portfolios to reacting to market sentiment, ChatGPT is being adapted to act as a trading assistant, risk manager and market analyst — all rolled into one. But can it truly match or even outperform human intuition? This article explores how far these agents have come, where they shine and where they still fall short.How ChatGPT-powered AI agents operate in cryptocurrency marketsChatGPT-powered AI agents are changing how people interact with crypto markets. These tools combine ChatGPT’s language abilities with external trading tools and APIs to help users monitor prices, understand trends and even place trades automatically. Instead of just reacting to charts or numbers, ChatGPT can understand plain language commands like “Buy Ethereum if the price drops below $2,000” or “Sell Bitcoin if RSI goes above 70.”These AI trading assistants can work with major platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, OKX and other centralized or decentralized exchanges and can also tap into decentralized finance (DeFi) tools and smart contracts. With the right setup, ChatGPT can help automate trading strategies based on both technical data and market news.Success stories vs. failures in ChatGPT-powered crypto tradingSome traders have used ChatGPT to assist in automating parts of their crypto trading processes, particularly for strategy generation and sentiment analysis. For example, a user shared on Reddit that they used a ChatGPT-based AI agent for technical analysis on Ether (ETH), feeding it four-hour and daily chart screenshots. By interpreting market sentiment, support and resistance zones, and other indicators, they managed to make $6,500 in profits.Similarly, in the broader crypto sector, ChatGPT has been applied to support project development activities such as drafting white papers and marketing content. A notable example is the launch of the “TURBO” memecoin, which reportedly reached a market capitalization of over $50 million in 2024. In this case, ChatGPT was used to streamline documentation and communication rather than manage trading activity, illustrating its usefulness as a support tool in crypto-related initiatives.However, limitations are evident when ChatGPT is applied beyond its core design. While ChatGPT could suggest a trading portfolio and explain its reasoning clearly, it lacks access to real-time market data and couldn’t respond to sudden volatility. In one instance, ChatGPT was allocated $100 across multiple tokens but failed to actively manage the portfolio as prices fluctuated. This resulted in missed opportunities and underperformance compared to dynamic algorithmic strategies.Individual experiences reinforce these observations. A Redditor exposed a scam where a YouTuber promoted a “ChatGPT trading bot” tutorial that led users to deploy malicious smart contracts. The contracts, generated using ChatGPT and passed off as safe, were designed to drain user wallets once funded. Victims collectively lost $17,240 in ETH, highlighting the danger of blindly trusting AI-generated code without proper auditing.Even when asked, “If I use ChatGPT to build an AI agent for crypto trading, can I become a millionaire?” ChatGPT responded with a realistic outlook — acknowledging that while it’s possible, success depends on having a profitable strategy, disciplined risk management, and the ability to scale effectively.Here is ChatGPT’s response:These cases suggest that while ChatGPT can support certain elements of the trading process, it should not be treated as a standalone solution for autonomous crypto trading.AI in crypto trading: Key benefits and limitationsAI tools like ChatGPT are increasingly being integrated into crypto trading workflows to improve speed, accuracy and efficiency. While they offer important advantages, they also carry specific limitations that traders must actively manage. Below are the main benefits and challenges:Key benefits of using AI for crypto tradingAI bots can execute trades in milliseconds, crucial for capturing opportunities in fast-moving crypto markets.Bots follow pre-programmed rules precisely, eliminating emotional biases that often affect human traders.Crypto markets are always open, and AI bots can monitor and act around the clock without interruption.A single bot can manage multiple trading pairs, exchanges and strategies simultaneously.ChatGPT can understand specific prompts like “Rebalance every Monday” or “Set stop-loss at 5%,” allowing flexible automation.Limitations of ChatGPT in cryptocurrency tradingChatGPT does not access live market data unless specifically integrated with external APIs (e.g., TradingView, CoinMarketCap or exchange websockets).Instructions must be clear and unambiguous; ChatGPT may misinterpret vague or complex commands.Improperly secured API keys or lack of two-factor authentication (2FA) can expose trading accounts to unauthorized access.ChatGPT’s cloud-based infrastructure can introduce latency, which could impact performance during highly volatile periods.ChatGPT does not monitor regional compliance rules; users must manually enforce trading limits based on local regulations.Ethical and regulatory implications of AI in crypto tradingAs AI becomes more integrated into trading systems, it raises significant ethical and regulatory concerns that stakeholders across the financial sector are beginning to address.Accountability: If an AI agent executes a harmful or unlawful trade, questions arise around legal responsibility. It remains unclear in many jurisdictions whether liability falls primarily on the developer, the trader using the AI system or the platform facilitating the transactions.Market manipulation risks: Autonomous AI bots could unintentionally engage in activities such as spoofing (placing and canceling fake orders to mislead the market) or wash trading (creating artificial volume), especially if not properly programmed with compliance safeguards.Regulatory oversight: Financial authorities, including the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the European Securities and Markets Authority, are actively studying the implications of AI and algorithmic trading. These agencies have recognized that traditional trading regulations may not fully account for autonomous decision-making by AI systems.Policy developments: In January 2024, the European Commission released updates to its Digital Finance Strategy, which included references to AI-based financial services. While not yet finalized, these draft regulations under the broader Digital Finance Package signal a move toward stricter compliance expectations for firms deploying AI in financial markets.Meanwhile, ethical crypto platforms are beginning to voluntarily disclose the use of trading bots in their systems. In parallel, open-source communities are advocating for clearer audit trails, improved model transparency and the establishment of ethical guidelines for AI applications in finance to ensure accountability and fairness.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Crypto travelers are also outspending their fiat counterparts, with an average booking value of  $1,211 per transaction, over 2.5 times more than fiat users who spend $469.Additionally, the report said crypto users were three times more valuable over their lifetime due to longer stays and higher repeat bookings, with crypto travelers 57% more likely to make a repeat hotel purchase.Source: Binance Pay, TravalaJuan Otero, CEO of Travala, attributed these travel preferences to the flexible nature of Web3 jobs:“Many also work in the digital asset industry or have flexible, remote work lifestyles, which makes them more likely to travel frequently and stay in one place for longer while seeking out destinations that support seamless, global payments.”Crypto-based transactions have become more common in the travel sector and beyond. Airlines that have integrated digital currencies into their booking systems have seen a 40% boost in bookings, with travel and hospitality representing 14% of all crypto transactions in 2024, according to a Feb. 21 report by Triple-A.Related: Crypto spending will grow, but fiat isn’t going anywhere: Mercuryo CEOThe main benefit of using crypto for travel is its borderless, global utility, Jonathan Lim, the global head of Binance Pay, told Cointelegraph. “Travelers can skip currency exchange lines, avoid foreign transaction fees, and pay instantly using assets they already hold,” he added.A growing number of crypto users also drives the increase in travelers using crypto to pay for trips. Triple-A’s report shows that cryptocurrency ownership has a compound annual growth rate of 99%, significantly outpacing the growth of traditional payment methods. Among crypto owners, 65% express interest in using it for payments.Founded in 2017, Travala is among the most popular crypto-native travel platforms, which enables users to pay for services like flights, hotel stays and tours with 141 different cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC) and USDC (USDC) via Binance Pay. Related: Bhutan launches tourism crypto payments with Binance Pay and DK BankCrypto payment covers more and more retail industriesThe first real-world Bitcoin transaction — 10,000 BTC for two pizzas — occurred 15 years ago today, on May 22, 2010, now commemorated as Bitcoin Pizza Day.

2025-05-22T08:37:57.000Z,"Dubai regulator clarifies real-world asset tokenization rules: Lawyer","Newly updated guidelines from Dubai’s crypto regulator include provisions on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and clarify rules for issuers. On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) released its updated Rulebook for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) operating in the region. The regulator gave market participants until June 19 to comply with the new rules. The regulator previously told Cointelegraph that it had enhanced supervisory mechanisms and brought consistency across activity-based rules. One of the more prominent changes includes regulatory clarity on RWA tokens. Irina Heaver, partner at the United Arab Emirates-based law firm NeosLegal, told Cointelegraph that the updated rules clarify RWA issuance and distribution. “Issuing real-world asset tokens and listing them on secondary markets is no longer theoretical,” Heaver told Cointelegraph. “It’s now a regulatory reality in Dubai and the broader UAE.”A “viable” path to realize RWA hypeHeaver compared RWAs to security token offerings (STOs), an earlier attempt from the crypto space to tokenize securities like stocks, bonds and real estate investment trusts. However, the UAE crypto lawyer said that STOs “died a peaceful death in 2018 to 2019.” The lawyer told Cointelegraph STOs did not work out because of the lack of regulatory clarity, viable secondary market trading venues, institutional investor appetite and liquidity. Still, the situation is different for RWAs. Heaver told Cointelegraph that RWAs are the next foundational layer for institutional adoption of blockchain and virtual assets. Heaver said that VARA’s new rules already cover them as Asset-Referenced Virtual Assets (ARVA) tokens. She said: “VARA’s newly updated Virtual Asset Issuance Rulebook (May 2025) addresses these failures head-on. Regulated exchanges and broker-dealers in Dubai are now authorized to distribute and list ARVA tokens.”The lawyer said this solves an issue in jurisdictions like Switzerland, where token issuance is possible, but listing and secondary trading remain unregulated. Related: Dubai gov’t agencies to link real estate registry with property tokenizationLawyer shares requirements for RWA issuersHeaver said ARVA tokens are defined under Dubai law as representing direct or indirect ownership of real-world assets, granting entitlement to receive or share income and purporting to maintain a stable value by reference to real-world assets or income. ARVA tokens are also backed or collateralised by such real-world assets or constitute a derivative, wrapped, duplicated, or fractionalised version of another ARVA. The lawyer said issuers must meet specific requirements, including a Category 1 Virtual Asset Issuance license, a comprehensive white paper and a risk disclosure statement. In addition, issuers must have a paid-up capital of 1.5 million UAE dirhams (about $408,000) or 2% of reserve assets held. The issuers are also subjected to monthly independent audit obligations and must adhere to ongoing supervisory oversight. “VARA is providing regulatory clarity, and it’s giving the industry a viable, enforceable path to turn the hype of RWA tokenization into reality,” Heaver told Cointelegraph. “This matters because it marks a shift, from theory to execution, from fiction to framework.”Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/dubai-vara-guidelines-rwa-tokenization-clarity?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-22T08:25:00.000Z,"5 red flags you’re being shilled: Don’t buy the hype","What is shilling in crypto?              At its core, shilling is the act of artificially promoting a cryptocurrency or token, often with exaggerated claims, to increase its price or popularity. But what’s the goal? Hype it up, get others to buy in, and then cash out, leaving latecomers holding the bag.Shilling can come from anyone: influencers, anonymous accounts or even high-profile figures with political or financial clout. The common thread is manipulation: It’s not about educating you or building real value but pumping hype for personal gain.Unfortunately, the line between enthusiastic promotion and outright deception can be thin, and many fall victim without realizing it. That’s why it’s critical to learn how to spot the signs early.                  5 red flags you’re being shilled              Beware of crypto red flags like overhyped promises, anonymous teams, influencer shills, missing products and FOMO tactics — if it smells like a scam, it probably is.1. Overhyped promises You’ve probably seen posts that scream:“100x potential!”“Guaranteed returns!”“This is your ticket to financial freedom!”These are classic shill tactics. Real, credible projects don’t promise life-changing profits. Why? Because there are no guarantees in crypto or in any investment.When a project leads with grandiose financial claims rather than actual product value or utility, it’s likely a ploy to stir FOMO and attract unsuspecting investors. The truth is, if something sounds too good to be true, it almost always is.Remember: The bigger the promise, the bigger the red flag.2. Anonymous or suspicious teams In crypto, anonymity isn’t always bad, but when you’re trusting people with your money, transparency matters.It’s a major red flag when a project has:No identifiable team membersFake names or aliasesStock photos on its websiteNo LinkedIn or professional history.The simple rule is “No face, no funds.”Scammers often hide behind anonymity because they know they’ll eventually vanish and there’ll be no one to hold accountable. Even worse, some use fabricated credentials or hire actors to pose as team members.Before investing, check whether the founders or developers have any verifiable history. Do they have prior experience in blockchain or startups? Have they launched anything successful before?3. Influencer spam and paid promotions One day, no one’s talking about a particular coin — the next, your feed is flooded with influencers hyping it up. Sound familiar?This sudden burst of attention is often coordinated with a paid promotion campaign disguised as “genuine enthusiasm.”Many influencers fail to disclose sponsorships, even though it’s required by law in many countries. The US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have cracked down on this in recent years.Take, for example:Kim Kardashian, who was fined $1.26 million in 2022 for promoting EthereumMax without proper disclosure.Floyd Mayweather Jr., who was sued for endorsing the same project at a paid event.BitBoy (Ben Armstrong), who faced legal action in multiple lawsuits for promoting scam tokens to his audience.If you notice multiple influencers promoting the same project in a short time, especially without using labels like #ad or #sponsored, it’s a strong indicator of a shill campaign.Don’t mistake volume for value. Hype doesn’t equal legitimacy.4. No real product or roadmapIf you visit the project’s website, it looks sleek, maybe even impressive. But where’s the product? Where’s the code?Shilled tokens often rely on flashy marketing but have no working application, no GitHub code and no actual use case. Everything is either “coming soon” or buried behind vague promises.Ask yourself:Can I use the platform or app today?Is there a white paper that makes sense?Do they have public repositories or open development?If all you’re seeing is a landing page and a vague roadmap that’s been “coming soon” for months, that’s a major red flag.5. Pressure tactics and FOMO Time pressure is a psychological weapon, and shillers know how to use it.Watch out for lines such as:“Presale ends in 2 hours!”“Only 1,000 spots left!”“If you don’t buy now, you’ll miss out forever!”These tactics prey on your fear of missing out (FOMO) and push you into making impulsive decisions without research.But crypto isn’t a sprint; it’s a long-term game. Anyone trying to rush you into buying likely has something to hide. Solid investments don’t need fake urgency.Take a breath, step back, and ask yourself: Am I buying because I believe in this project or because I’m being manipulated?Did you know? The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) secured a $128-million judgment against Ryan Mitchell Pope, Daniel Samuel Bishop and their company EmpiresX for operating a fraudulent forex and cryptocurrency investment scheme that defrauded over 12,500 victims.                  Is shilling illegal in crypto? Can influencers be sued?              Shilling isn’t just unethical in many cases — it’s also illegal.In the world of crypto, undisclosed promotions are a major legal risk. If someone is paid to promote a token or project but fails to reveal that financial connection, they could face fines, lawsuits or even criminal charges. This is especially true if the promoted token is later classified as a security under US law.Regulators like the SEC, FTC and CFTC have all cracked down on this behavior. Their targets have included:Influencers who failed to disclose paid promotionsPromoters who misled investors with false claimsIndividuals who ran pump-and-dump schemes using social media.Francier Obando Pinillo, a pastor from Miami, was indicted on 26 fraud counts for running a crypto scam through “Solano Fi,” defrauding investors of millions from 2021 to 2023. He allegedly used his church, social media and false promises of 34.9% monthly returns to lure victims. The platform showed fake gains but blocked withdrawals, while funds were diverted for personal use. Pinillo was arraigned in Richland, Washington and faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.As crypto becomes more mainstream, expect stricter regulations and more consequences for shillers.Did you know? Argentine President Javier Milei has dissolved the special task force investigating the LIBRA cryptocurrency scandal, a project he promoted in February 2025 that surged to a $4.5-billion valuation before crashing by over 97%. The task force, created by Milei himself, was disbanded via Decree 332/2025, citing that it had fulfilled its purpose. However, critics argue that no official findings were released, and judicial investigations into Milei and his associates continue.                  How to protect yourself from shilling scams              Do your own research, verify the team and utility, ignore hype and influencers, and stay alert to pump-and-dump schemes to avoid crypto shilling traps.Let’s understand how you can protect yourself from shilling scams in crypto:Do your own research (DYOR): Always research the project, the team behind it and the data supporting the claims. Don’t rely solely on hype or influencer recommendations. Look into onchain data, GitHub activity and the project’s utility to make informed decisions.Verify the team: A legitimate crypto project should have a transparent and credible team. If the developers are anonymous or have no professional profiles (like LinkedIn), that’s a red flag. Always check the team’s past projects and credibility before investing.Look for real utility: Does this project actually solve a problem? A genuine project should have a working product or solution, not just promises. Avoid projects that lack real-world utility or are still in “coming soon” stages for extended periods.Ignore the hype: If a token is suddenly trending on social media or being aggressively promoted, don’t let FOMO influence your judgment. Shillers often rely on emotions to push their agenda, so it’s essential to evaluate projects based on their merits, not just popularity.Stay skeptical of influencers: Influencers with large followings may be paid to promote certain tokens. Before taking their advice, ask yourself, What’s their incentive? Verify the promotion is legitimate and disclosed as paid or sponsored. Always cross-check the information with independent sources.Watch for pump-and-dump schemes: Be cautious of sudden price spikes followed by rapid drops. These are often signs of pump-and-dump schemes where the token’s value is artificially inflated by coordinated buying and then quickly sold off, leaving investors with losses. Always monitor price trends and be wary of sudden, unexplained increases in value.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/5-red-flags-youre-being-shilled-dont-buy-the-hype?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
