2025-05-23T12:54:15.000Z,"Upgrade in the Solana Development Process May Trigger a Solaxy Rally","The Solana development process is progressing rapidly.and could see $SOL, Solana meme coins, and Layer 2 token Solaxy, ($SOLX) rally. It all started with Firedancer , Solana’s long-awaited new validator. Developed by Jump Crypto, and promising 1M TPS (Transactions-Per-Second), it was expected to improve the network’s stability, performance, and overall efficiency. However, a partial Firedancer implementation, Frankendancer, which has been live since March 25, 2025, has failed to produce the desired results. According to the internal reports , only 5% of Solana stake runs on the new client. But things are about to change as Roger Wattenhofer, Head of Research at Anza, announced Alpenglow at the Solana Accelerate conference on Monday, asserting the new consensus protocol could significantly reduce Solana’s latency: ‘We believe that the release of Alpenglow will be a turning point for Solana. Alpenglow is not only a new consensus protocol, but the biggest change to Solana’s core protocol since, well, ever.’ —Roger Wattenhofer, Alpenglow: A New Consensus for Solana Where to for Solana and Related Coins like Solaxy? Alpenglow promises to reshape Solana’s core protocol by replacing legacy components like TowerBFT and Proof-of-History with Votor, which takes over the voting and block finalization logic. This translates to a massive upgrade to Solana’s performance. According to Roger Wattenhofer’s report : ‘With TowerBFT, Solana had about 12.8 sec from block creation until block finality. We expect that Alpenglow can achieve actual finality in about 150 ms (median). Sometimes finality can be achieved as fast as 100 ms, which is an unbelievably low number for a world-wide L1 blockchain protocol.’ —Roger Wattenhofer, Alpenglow: A New Consensus for Solana Meanwhile, two Solana-based meme coins, $MOODENG and $MEW , are pumping hard after being released into the crypto wild by Robinhood. Word of Solana’s recent update is also likely to fuel another related project: Solaxy ($SOLX), one of the best presales of 2025. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Layer 2 Upgrade Promising to Fix Solana’s Performance Problems As Solana’s Layer 2 upgrade, Solaxy ($SOLX) is the latest attempt at tackling the network’s most glaring performance problems: slow transactions and downtime during network congestion. The project’s presale is currently underway and progressing nicely, combining Pepe’s meme potential with a utility-based token that fuels a growing ecosystem. Solaxy aims to implement a zero-downtime environment, eliminating network congestion and failed transactions. It also intends to speed up transactions and offer infinite scalability thanks to Solaxy’s off-chain execution. The project has been under rapid development since its inception, with the devs posting regular updates once or twice a month. Among the latest is the implementation of the Testnet Bridge connecting Solana to Devnet and aiming to improve interoperability with the Ethereum network. The Solaxy presale is about to end in 24 days, which means the window to get in at discounted prices is closing fast. The ICO has already raised over $39M with $SOLX currently valued at $0.001732, and the token is likely to pump post-launch. If you’re interested, check out our analysts’ price prediction for $SOLX for 2025-2030. Based on the project’s specifics, support, and utility, we expect $SOLX to reach a market price of $0.2 by the end of 2026, racking in a mouth-watering 12,440% ROI. This means that a $50 investment could turn into $6,270 in little over a year. Don’t let anyone tell you that FOMO is a bad thing. If you’ve decided to join the project, do it now, before Solaxy goes public. Check our ‘how to buy $SOLX’ guide for a step-by-step guide to buying and staking your tokens to secure 101% APY. Will Solaxy Pay Off? With Solana under pressure to resolve its issues, and other developments like Alpenglow promising radical performance improvements, all evidence suggests that Solaxy ($SOLX) could become a vital component of the Solana ecosystem and pay off big in the years ahead. Remember, this isn’t financial advice.

2025-05-23T12:51:40.000Z,"Ripple Price Analysis: What XRP Needs to Break Out of Consolidation","XRP has been showing signs of quiet accumulation within a broader consolidation structure. As of today, it continues to trade below major resistance zones but is building a compelling technical structure that could precede a significant move if confirmed by volume and momentum shifts. Technical Analysis The USDT Pair Looking at the XRP/USDT pair, the price remains tightly compressed inside a descending channel that has been developing since early 2025. The 100-day moving average (orange) is acting as dynamic support, while the 200-day moving average (blue) is now sloping upward and serving as another stronger support element. The price action recently tapped the upper bound of this triangle near $2.60 but failed to break through convincingly. Meanwhile, the buyers are currently defending the $2.40–$2.30 zone. A daily candle close above the $2.80 area could trigger bullish continuation, with $3 and $4 as immediate upside targets. Conversely, a breakdown below $2 would invalidate the structure and likely lead to a drop toward the lower boundary of the channel near the $1.5 mark. The BTC Pair Against Bitcoin, XRP is hovering just above key support at 2200 SAT, a level that has repeatedly held since mid-April. The pair has been trending lower within a descending channel, compressing against horizontal support. Both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages are now flattening out above the current price, acting as key dynamic resistance levels. This setup reflects a bearish bias unless bulls can reclaim 2400 SAT and push out of the descending channel and above the moving averages. The momentum is also clearly weakening, as reflected by the RSI sitting near 40, indicating a lack of bullish strength. If 2200 SAT is lost, XRP/BTC could quickly slide to the 1600-1800 SAT range, which is the next visible demand zone.

2025-05-23T12:50:36.000Z,"BlackRock’s BTC ETF Bets Are Back — Is Bitcoin About to Explode Past $110K?","Bitcoin dropped to $108,000 during European hours, down 1.4% on the day and below the ascending channel support. Despite $57.7 billion in 24 hour volume, failing to hold above $112,000 has triggered short term profit taking. The pullback coincides with macro uncertainty and a 2 hour bearish engulfing candle which is a sign of potential trend reversal. But beneath the surface institutional interest remains strong. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) now has $20 billion in notional open interest – Wall Street is getting in. Total options open interest is $65 billion according to Amberdata with traders betting BTC will hit $116,000 or $120,000 in the next few weeks. Bitcoin Options Open Interest Spikes to Record High as Traders Target $116K ► https://t.co/3qeyQt1ZOG https://t.co/3qeyQt1ZOG — Decrypt (@DecryptMedia) May 22, 2025 Points: BTC price: $108,000 Resistance: $112,000 BlackRock ETF open interest: $20B Options market OI: $65B Options Point to $120K Targets for Bitcoin Options are bullish medium term. Deribit’s order book shows $23 billion in call options vs $13.9 billion in puts – more traders are betting on higher prices. The skew is heavily in favor of upside bets especially for June expiry where large positions are building at strike prices between $110,000 and $130,000. Block Scholes notes an increase in out of the money calls and the overall put/call ratio is 0.61 – more bullish. There’s a lot of activity at strikes above current levels with $420 million and $620 million notional value on the $200K and $300K calls respectively. Call/Put volume: $23B / $13.9B Top strikes: $116K–$130K near term Long shots: $200K+ calls worth over $1B Expiries Add Risk, June is the Promise; Bitcoin Volatile 25,000 BTC options worth $2.81 billion are expiring today which will add to short term volatility. The put/call ratio for today is 1.22 – near term bearish. The “max pain” level – the price where most options expire worthless – is at $104,000 so a further drop is possible if momentum doesn’t bounce back soon. 25,000 BTC options are set to expire with a Put/Call Ratio of 1.22, a max pain point at $104,000, and a notional value of $2.81 billion. Meanwhile, 202,000 ETH options will also expire with a Put/Call Ratio of 1.26, a max pain point at $2,450, and a notional value of $570… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 23, 2025 But most of the interest has shifted to June 27 expiries which now account for over 30% of total open interest. Analysts like Peter Yan say this is a sign of deeper institutional positioning and expectations of more volatility ahead. Bitcoin Technical Outlook Technically, Bitcoin price prediction seems bullish as BTC needs to reclaim the $108,400–$108,650 zone to get back in a buying zone. If not, next supports are at $107,077 and $105,905. The MACD is showing a bearish crossover and expanding red histogram bars – be cautious.

But with technical pressure building and key options expiries in play, short term caution may prevail before the next breakout. BTC Bull Token Nears $7.14M Cap as 71% Staking Yield Fuels FOMO As the BTC/USD pair hovers near $108K, attention is rapidly turning to high-upside altcoins — and BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is stealing the spotlight. With $6.17 million raised out of its $7.14 million cap, momentum is accelerating as the next presale price jump closes in fast. What sets BTCBULL apart is its unique rewards model — token holders receive Bitcoin airdrops directly tied to BTC’s price rallies. The higher Bitcoin climbs, the more BTC gets distributed — with presale buyers receiving priority rewards over post-launch DEX investors. Key Stats: USDT Raised: $6,221,583.95 / $7,136,435 Token Price: $0.002525 Staking Pool: 1.47B BTCBULL Yield: ~71% APY Built-in scarcity adds even more firepower: every time Bitcoin rises by $50K, BTC Bull triggers a token burn, reducing supply and increasing upside potential for long-term holders. Meanwhile, staking is turning heads. BTCBULL offers a whopping ~71% APY on its Ethereum-based staking pool (currently holding 1.47B BTCBULL), with no lockups or withdrawal fees. That means passive yield — with full liquidity.

2025-05-23T12:48:44.000Z,"Is BlockDAG Ever Going to Launch? Bitcoin Solaris Comes Designed With Scarcity, Roadmaps and Launch Dates","The post Is BlockDAG Ever Going to Launch? Bitcoin Solaris Comes Designed With Scarcity, Roadmaps and Launch Dates appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News BlockDAG has generated considerable buzz with its claims of innovative architecture and scalability. However, despite aggressive marketing and wide social media traction, there is still no live product, no working mainnet, and no published date for token utility activation. Investors are increasingly asking when — or if — BlockDAG will deliver a functional blockchain. With no verifiable roadmap milestones achieved to date, the enthusiasm is being met with mounting skepticism. In contrast, Bitcoin Solaris is moving forward with a defined launch structure, detailed whitepaper, working infrastructure, and third-party audits already completed. While BlockDAG continues to operate in pre-launch ambiguity, Bitcoin Solaris is executing a step-by-step rollout grounded in transparency and provable scarcity. Bitcoin Solaris Offers Defined Token Supply and Network Participation Bitcoin Solaris maintains a hard cap of 21 million BTC-S tokens, with no future minting. Supply is allocated across fixed categories, with 20% designated for presale participants. The tokenomics are public, governed by smart contracts, and fully audited — ensuring that users are not exposed to shifting emissions or liquidity risks post-launch. Where BlockDAG has yet to detail its full economic model or provide clear evidence of token issuance mechanics, Bitcoin Solaris has already outlined its entire reward distribution structure through mobile mining and validator operations. This includes the upcoming Nova App, which will allow users to mine BTC-S directly from smartphones by contributing 1–5 GB of storage and idle CPU. Earnings are based on device uptime, not speculation. Mobile Mining and Live Architecture Distinguish Bitcoin Solaris Unlike concepts still in development, Bitcoin Solaris has completed its infrastructure build. The project operates on a dual-layer blockchain using Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Capacity (PoC) for base-layer security, combined with Proof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Time (PoT) on the Solaris execution layer. This system supports over 10,000 transactions per second with finality in two seconds — specs that are deployed and ready for global mobile participation. The Nova App is scheduled for rollout shortly after the close of the presale, with mining logic already tested and integrated. This timeline stands in sharp contrast to BlockDAG’s undefined roadmap and perpetual marketing phase. Independent Audits and Governance Verification Completed Bitcoin Solaris has completed a Cyberscope audit , confirming token contract behavior and emission limits. A Freshcoins audit evaluated system scalability and mobile mining integrity. The development team has also undergone full KYC verification , providing transparency around team leadership and governance. This level of review is not currently matched by BlockDAG, which has yet to publish any audit documentation or formal verification of team credentials. Presale Actively Underway With Fixed Terms Bitcoin Solaris is currently in Presale Phase 4, where BTC-S tokens are priced at 4 USDT. A total of 4.2 million tokens are allocated for this phase, and no further supply will be created. Participants are securing access not only to tokens but to early mining opportunities before network-wide competition begins. This presale is part of a clearly defined sequence leading into app launch, public listing, and mining rewards — all already laid out in the project documentation. By comparison, BlockDAG continues to accept new funds without delivering confirmed progress on protocol functionality or release dates. In a recent review, Crypto Volt discussed the gap between project visibility and technical readiness. He noted that Bitcoin Solaris is one of the few protocols offering both clear communication and demonstrable infrastructure — while others remain in promotional mode without delivering real functionality. BlockDAG continues to promise next-generation architecture, but the lack of a working product and concrete delivery timeline raises valid concerns. Bitcoin Solaris, by contrast, is delivering what the market increasingly demands: transparent launch phases, capped supply, audited contracts, and a live infrastructure. Now in Presale Phase 4 at 4 USDT, it offers users a clearly defined entry into protocol-level rewards before full network activity begins. For investors focused on delivery over speculation, the distinction is becoming harder to ignore.

If they step in, it will move closer toward $500,000,” Dragosch told Cointelegraph, referring to the US government’s proposition to make direct Bitcoin acquisitions through “budget-neutral” strategies. Bitwise’s “in-house prediction” for 2029 is a $1 million Bitcoin price target, as Bitcoin’s market cap will surpass the market capitalization of gold, as the leading safe-haven asset, Dragosch explained.

2025-05-23T12:40:24.000Z,"BTC Perpetual Futures: Crucial Long-Short Ratios Reveal Neutral Market Sentiment","BitcoinWorld BTC Perpetual Futures: Crucial Long-Short Ratios Reveal Neutral Market Sentiment Hey there, crypto traders and enthusiasts! Ever wonder how to get a pulse on what the majority of leveraged traders are thinking about Bitcoin’s next move? One powerful, yet often misunderstood, tool is the BTC perpetual futures long-short ratio . This metric offers a glimpse into the collective sentiment of participants in the crypto derivatives market, specifically on perpetual contracts. Perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the price of an asset, like Bitcoin (BTC), without an expiry date. Unlike traditional futures, they mimic the spot market price through a funding rate mechanism. They are incredibly popular in the crypto space due to their flexibility and leverage options. What Exactly is the Long-Short Ratio? The long-short ratio is a metric provided by cryptocurrency exchanges that indicates the proportion of traders who are holding long positions versus those holding short positions in a specific contract, like BTC perpetual futures . A long position is a bet that the price will go up, while a short position is a bet that the price will go down. This ratio is typically calculated based on the amount of open interest held by long and short positions. Open interest refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts that have not been settled. When the ratio is high (e.g., significantly above 1 or 50% long), it suggests that more traders are positioned for a price increase. When the ratio is low (e.g., significantly below 1 or 50% long), it indicates a higher proportion of traders expecting a price decrease. How Does Open Interest Influence the Ratio? Understanding open interest is key to interpreting the long-short ratio. The ratio isn’t just about the number of traders, but the volume of contracts they hold. A few large traders with significant positions can skew the ratio more than many small traders. Exchanges calculate this ratio by summing the total value or number of contracts in open long positions and dividing it by the total value or number of contracts in open short positions. The data we are looking at reflects this ratio based on open interest over a 24-hour period across major platforms for BTC perpetual futures . Analyzing the Latest BTC Long-Short Ratios Let’s dive into the data for the past 24 hours across three of the largest crypto derivatives exchanges: Binance, OKX, and Bybit. The data is based on the long-short ratio derived from open interest: 24-Hour BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios (Based on Open Interest) Platform Long % Short % Total (Aggregated) 50.55% 49.45% Binance 50.27% 49.73% OKX 51.13% 48.87% Bybit 50.22% 49.78% As you can see, the ratios are remarkably balanced across the board. The aggregated total shows a near 50/50 split, with a slight lean towards longs. Individual exchanges like Binance and Bybit mirror this balanced sentiment closely, while OKX shows a slightly stronger, though still minor, preference for long positions. What Does a Near 50/50 Split Signify for Bitcoin Trading? A long-short ratio hovering so close to 50% long and 50% short suggests a market that is currently undecided or experiencing balanced conviction between bullish and bearish outlooks. For Bitcoin trading , this kind of neutrality can indicate several things: Uncertainty: Traders lack a strong consensus on the immediate price direction. Consolidation: The market might be in a period of range-bound trading as bulls and bears battle for control. Waiting Game: Participants might be waiting for a significant catalyst (news, technical breakout/breakdown) before committing strongly in either direction. Liquidity: A balanced ratio can sometimes imply healthy liquidity on both sides of the market, making large price swings less likely in the very short term unless new significant volume enters. It’s a snapshot of sentiment, showing that neither the bulls nor the bears have a dominant edge in terms of leveraged positioning based on open interest at this specific time. Benefits of Tracking the Long-Short Ratio Monitoring the long-short ratio offers several advantages for those involved in crypto derivatives : Sentiment Check: Provides a quick, quantifiable measure of market sentiment among leveraged traders. Potential Contrarian Indicator: Sometimes, an *extremely* skewed ratio can be a contrarian signal. For instance, if the ratio is overwhelmingly long, it might suggest an overcrowded trade prone to a sharp correction if sentiment shifts (a ‘long squeeze’). Conversely, an extremely short ratio could precede a ‘short squeeze’. Exchange Comparison: Allows comparison of sentiment across different platforms, highlighting potential differences in trader demographics or strategies. Challenges and Limitations to Consider While useful, the long-short ratio is not a crystal ball and has limitations: Not Predictive: It shows *current* positioning, not future price movements. A heavily skewed ratio doesn’t guarantee a price move in the opposite direction. Can Be Manipulated: Large players (whales) can sometimes intentionally skew the ratio to trap smaller traders. Context is Crucial: The ratio should always be analyzed alongside other technical indicators, fundamental news, and overall market structure. Data Lag: The ratio reflects past activity (in this case, the last 24 hours based on open interest) and might not capture immediate shifts in sentiment. Actionable Insights for Your Bitcoin Trading Strategy So, how can you use this information in your Bitcoin trading ? Given the current balanced state of the BTC perpetual futures long-short ratio, here are some actionable insights: Confirm Neutrality: If other indicators (like technical analysis patterns, volume, or volatility measures) also suggest a period of consolidation or uncertainty, the neutral long-short ratio reinforces this view. Beware of False Breakouts: In a neutral market, price movements might lack conviction. Be cautious of quick pumps or dumps that could be ‘fakeouts’ if the underlying leveraged sentiment isn’t strongly directional. Look for Divergence: Keep an eye on how the ratio changes if price starts making significant moves. Does a price increase lead to a rapid surge in long positions (indicating conviction) or does the ratio remain neutral or even decrease (suggesting the move isn’t widely trusted by leveraged traders)? Combine with Open Interest Analysis: A balanced ratio alongside increasing open interest might suggest strong accumulation/distribution happening within a range. A balanced ratio with decreasing open interest might indicate traders are closing positions, perhaps awaiting clarity. Use as a Confirmation Tool: Never use the long-short ratio in isolation. Use it as one piece of the puzzle to confirm or question signals from your primary trading strategy. For example, if you see a bullish technical pattern forming on the BTC chart, but the long-short ratio remains stubbornly neutral or even leans short, it might be a signal to approach the potential long trade with caution, perhaps using less leverage or setting tighter stop losses. Conclusion: A Snapshot of a Balanced Market The 24-hour long-short ratio for BTC perpetual futures across major exchanges currently paints a picture of a remarkably balanced market sentiment among leveraged traders. With longs and shorts holding nearly equal sway based on open interest , the data suggests neither extreme greed nor fear is dominating these platforms right now. This neutrality is a crucial piece of information for anyone navigating the volatile world of crypto derivatives . Remember, while the long-short ratio offers valuable insight into leveraged positioning, it is just one tool in a comprehensive market analysis arsenal. Successful Bitcoin trading involves considering multiple data points, understanding market structure, and managing risk effectively. A balanced ratio might indicate a period of calm before a storm, or simply a reflection of ongoing indecision. Staying informed and using data points like this ratio wisely can help you make more informed decisions.

2025-05-23T12:36:14.000Z,"Analyst Identifies Key Conditions For XRP’s Rise to $37","Technical analyst EGRAG has released a new outlook on XRP’s price trajectory, presenting bullish and bearish possibilities based on key market indicators. His analysis centers on the behaviour of XRP on the weekly chart, highlighting moving average crossovers as significant drivers of future trends. XRP is experiencing a minor decline, down 0.82% over the past week, while Bitcoin (BTC) has increased by 8.45%, pushing toward its record high. Despite XRP’s downturn, EGRAG believes that the long-term movement will depend on the interaction between two specific technical indicators, the 21-week exponential moving average (EMA) and the 33-week simple moving average (SMA). #XRP – The Secrets Are Revealed ($5.7, $9.5, $27 & $37): It all comes down to the relationship between the 21 EMA and the 33 SMA. When I’ll Sell a Big Portion of #XRP : If the 21 EMA experiences a bearish cross with the 33 SMA on the weekly chart, that’s my signal: the… pic.twitter.com/lUT0Gr42nC — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) May 19, 2025 Death Cross May Signal Market Top EGRAG has outlined a specific condition under which he intends to liquidate his XRP holdings. According to his analysis, a key bearish signal emerges when the 21-week EMA falls below the 33-week SMA, an event he refers to as a “death cross.” This pattern, he argues, typically marks the end of an upward trend and the beginning of a prolonged decline. Historical data support this view. In May 2018, when this bearish crossover occurred, XRP’s price dropped by 87%. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A similar event in November 2021 resulted in a 72% correction. Based on these patterns, EGRAG estimates that XRP could decline by approximately 79.5% if this crossover appears again, the average of the past two downturns. He also cautions that other market observers might remain optimistic during this period, but he sees the crossover as a critical warning of an impending shift toward bearish territory. Bullish Cross Suggests Upside Potential In contrast, EGRAG also examines the positive implications of a bullish crossover, when the 21 EMA rises above the 33 SMA. This crossover occurred most recently in September 2024 and, according to his analysis, may still be influencing XRP’s price trend. EGRAG highlights several past occurrences of this bullish crossover and the substantial price increases that followed. In 2017, XRP surged by 6,500% following the crossover in March. Later that year, another crossover led to a 1,600% gain between December 2017 and January 2018. In July 2020, a similar pattern preceded an 855% increase, bringing XRP to $1.96 by April 2021. Following the September 2024 bullish signal, XRP climbed over 520%, briefly exceeding $3 between November 2024 and January 2025. Based on historical trends, EGRAG projects potential price targets of $5.70, $9.50, and $37. However, he considers $27 to be the most realistic near-term peak. This figure reflects a 1,600% increase from XRP’s value during the September crossover. Post-Rally Correction Expected EGRAG further notes that past bullish crossovers were eventually followed by bearish ones, which triggered the significant price corrections he outlined earlier. In his view, if XRP reaches the $27 mark , the formation of a new death cross could initiate a decline of approximately 79.5%, consistent with the historical average. While the forecast includes a potential surge, it warns that such rallies may precede sharp corrections. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

These applications had second deadlines coming up later this month. However, the watchdog continues its now familiar pattern of dragging its heels on crypto-related ETFs. The postponements come as approved Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) linked ETFs are hitting positive inflows, depicting a surge in retail traders’ investment. The global digital asset market is buzzing and hitting fresh all-time highs (ATH) on the indexes. BTC went on to record its fresh ATH of around $111,900 on May 22, 2025. SEC delays XRP ETFs again According to Bloomberg’s James Seyffart , the decision on Bitwise’s ETF could come around August 23 and CoinShares’ on August 24. Adding to the regulatory traffic jam, the SEC also officially acknowledged a filing for a staked Tron (TRX) ETF from Canary Capital . It can be true that a staked TRX product could soon be under formal review, but an acknowledgment doesn’t mean approval. However, it does mark the start of the comment period and procedural countdown. For XRP, the commission has now “instituted proceedings” for both Bitwise and CoinShares’ applications. It has opened the floor for public comment and rebuttals. Once the decision is published in the Federal Register, the public will have 21 days to respond. Then it will face another 35 days for counterarguments. It can be seen as a signal that the agency wants more input before making a final call, or even stop it for some more time. As expected, more delays on crypto ETFs dropped today. Delays include @BitwiseInvest & @CoinSharesCo XRP ETFs. Delay on Litecoin ETF Filing. Delay on @Fidelity 's In-kind Bitcoin filing.

XRP price has surged by a huge 360% in the last year, going from trading at $0.51 in November 2024 to around $2.43 on May 23, 2025. In the meantime, it also knocked out the $3 mark, back in January 2025. Crypto ETFs just had their biggest day As the delays continue to pile up, the regulator has also hit pause on CoinShares’ Litecoin ETF, Fidelity’s in-kind Bitcoin ETF. It has recently pushed back on XRP ETF filings from Grayscale and 21Shares too. With Canary and WisdomTree’s XRP applications due later this month, the expectation is clear that more delays might be coming in. Crypto ETFs may have started slow, but they’re now stampeding their way forward. US spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs posted $1.05 billion in daily net inflows on Thursday. This has been the highest since January. On May 22 alone, spot BTC ETFs pulled in $934.8 million as BlackRock’s IBIT led the way with $877 million of inflows.

This is due to its utility, as an AMM, it has been a popular protocol in the sector, and has been showing fewer dependencies on BTC price action ripples. Per ITB , it has 0.43 based on a 60-day correlation compared to other altcoins that have higher correlation.However, its own price action has gotten more attractive and could be on its way to rising soon. As per its on-chain data, the monthly Uniswap protocol volume on L2s per the Dune Analytics dashboard is rising and saw $26 billion plus volume. Not only that, but the recent financial disclosures and strategic initiatives by the Uniswap Foundation were shared . Even the detailed Q1 2025 report of Uniswap Foundation presents a compelling bullish narrative for UNI’s price trajectory. Keep reading to know more. Uniswap Foundations Q1 Financial Report Suggests Optimistic View For UNI Price Growth Per the report shared by UF, it says on March 31, 2025, the Foundation held $53.4 million in USD and stablecoins, 15.8 million UNI tokens, and 257 ETH, totaling approximately $95 million. Meanwhile, an additional 5 million UNI tokens were held as collateral against a $29 million loan. The report says it is a structured loan to provide immediate liquidity while minimizing market impact. Similarly, in that report, they also added that in Q1 2025, $12.4 million in new grants were committed by them, with $9.9 million earmarked for 2026 through 2029. These grants focus on enhancing capital efficiency across EVM chains, developing premier DeFi platforms, and activating sustainable revenue streams per the firm. Financial image | Source: Uniswap Foundation Moreover, the report concluded by saying that in Q1’2025, the Foundation accrued $1.9 million in operating expenses, excluding 0.1 million employee token awards in UNI. The Foundation also realized $140.3 million in Revenue: Donations, Dividends, and Interest in Q1’2025. Donations of $140 million were raised via the governance proposal. Overall, these developments suggest a strong foundation for Uniswap’s continued growth and innovation. For investors, this strategic positioning and financial robustness displayed in this report could be a signal for a positive outlook for the future performance of Uniswap price. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Here’s Where the Bitcoin (BTC) Price Needs to Reach to Trigger a Strong AltSeason! , Will UNI Price Reach $9.20 Target Soon? In Q2 2025, the UNI price performance was not so bullish on the chart, but the on-chain factors indicate ongoing accumulation. Per the IntoTheBlock data (ITB), the total amount leaving exchanges to user wallets surged 130% in the past 30 days, and the total number of withdrawal transactions surged 24%. This shows that heavy accumulation is going on when the price has not begun rising. The on-chain and other optimistic factors highlight that the UNI price is due for a rise. Moreover, on the daily chart, the price action has shown a double bottom pattern, which would soon lead to a bullish breakout. In the short term, the price of UNI needs to clear the previous high at $7.60, then it could reach $9.20 by May or June 2025. But in the long term, it is at a multi-year support zone and UNI crypto to enter a bullish trend, then the clearance of $9.20 is essential, which is a high volume profile level. Once cleared by the end of 2025, the targets are upto $19, but if not cleared with momentum, then it might repel the trend and take $6 support. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-23T12:09:15.000Z,"Cardano Price Prediction: ADA To Hit $14 Next Market Cycle?","The post Cardano Price Prediction: ADA To Hit $14 Next Market Cycle? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Cardano rose from $0.72 to over $0.83 this week, in tandem with the Bitcoin price. There was also a sudden spike in ADA/JPY trading, which shot up in volume and hit $121.5 million in 24 hours. That made it the second most traded ADA pair globally. Analyst’s Bold $8-$14 ADA Prediction Crypto analyst Drini has shared a bullish ADA prediction on X. In the next market cycle, he expects a possible price range of $8 to $14 for Cardano. He breaks it down using two key metrics: the total crypto market cap, and ADA’s market dominance. Drini points out that during the last bull cycle, the total crypto market cap peaked at the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level. If this pattern repeats, he expects the total crypto market cap could hit $6.5 trillion, which is just a drop compared to Wall Street’s $100 trillion equity market. In the previous cycle, Cardano’s market dominance peaked at 4.5% of the total crypto market. If the same is applied to a $6.5 trillion market cap, then ADA’s market cap would soar to $292.5 billion, and its price would rally to $8 per ADA. If things get really bullish and the total crypto market hits $10 trillion, a level backed by power law and regression models, Drini says that ADA could soar to $10–$14, with a market cap around $450 billion. But all of this depends on how market factors play out. Drini clarified that this projections were not based on hype, but he backed it with data, past trends, and solid math. In the best-case scenario, Cardano would repeat its past dominance while the crypto market hits new highs. Massive Bull Run Coming Analyst Dan Gambardello also predicts that a massive ADA bull run is coming, while most people don’t expect it right now. He highlights that the MACD indicator on both the monthly and weekly charts is starting to show signs of a big move upward. This kind of pattern was seen right before ADA surged last cycle. In the short term, ADA has broken out of a classic bullish pattern called the inverse head and shoulders and successfully held the breakout level. But its now facing resistance at the 200-day moving average. If it breaks above this level, we could see a strong rally. Otherwise, it could drop to $0.65 to $0.58. On the upside, $1 is a key psychological level. If ADA pushes past $1, the next goal could be $1.20 to $1.25.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/uncategorized/cardano-price-prediction-ada-to-hit-14-next-market-cycle/,"ADA|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Uncategorized",cryptocompare

Trump said the talks with the Union are leading to no meaningful results and proposed a straight 50% tariff starting from June 1. The US President believes the EU was formed for the “primary purpose of taking advantage of the United States” on the trade front, and its multiple barriers have made it difficult for everyday Americans. In fact, he claimed that the Union’s policies have led to a Trade Deficit with the US of more than $250,000,000 per year. His statement, which went live minutes ago, had a profound and immediate effect on the cryptocurrency markets, as did previous tariff-related announcements.

Analysis Firm Evaluates the Latest Situation in BTC!","Bitcoin (BTC) broke new records after four difficult months, rising above $111,000 according to Binance TR data. While the general expectation in the market is for the rise in Bitcoin to continue, Singapore-based cryptocurrency company QCP Capital evaluated the latest situation in Bitcoin. Accordingly, analysts stated that the upward trend in Bitcoin is solid, and that the brief pullback after ATH was due to profit taking, but the upward demand quickly resumed. Noting that the recent BTC rally reflects a solid trend supported by improved structural fundamentals and relatively low volatility, analysts said, “this rally feels more structurally sound than the previous one.” Analysts said that the options market also pointed to a rise in Bitcoin, and that traders quickly bought calls after a short-term decline. “After BTC’s initial ATH, it triggered profit taking and a brief drop occurred. But buyers quickly reloaded on the upside. Most notably, 1,000 call contracts were aggressively purchased at the 130K strike in September.” Noting that the bull trend is currently continuing, analysts added that institutional Bitcoin bull Strategy’s plan to use its $2.1 billion, 10% yielding Perpetual Preferred Share (STRF) offering for BTC purchases could be a catalyst that could push prices even higher. Despite all this positive sentiment, analysts said broader macro risks still remain in play. At this point, QCP analysts stated that renewed tariff concerns, rising US yields, and a stronger dollar could bring volatility, especially for altcoins. *This is not investment advice.

In a May 22 announcement , Genius Group explained that it has resumed accumulating Bitcoin ( BTC ) following a favorable ruling by the US Court of Appeals.

Genius Group announced it increased its Bitcoin Treasury 40% with the purchase of 24.5 BTC, worth around $2.7 million. The company now holds 85.5 BTC acquired for a total of $8.5 million, at an average price of $99,700 per coin. “We are pleased to be able to begin the task of rebuilding shareholder value from the damage caused by the legal actions of third parties, and delivering on our 2025 plan,” the company’s CEO, Roger Hamilton, said.

2025-05-23T12:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin: The Fruit Of The Genius Act, Reflections On The Price Action (Rating Upgrade)","Summary Bitcoin surpassed its all-time highs, shortly before Pizza Day, driven by new inflows and expectations of favorable stablecoin regulation (the GENIUS Act). Institutional adoption seems to support Bitcoin, with major banking figures shifting their stance and supporting Bitcoin. Bitcoin maintains a solitary growth, while gold and the S&P 500 lag behind, even though I still expect an increasing correlation with the U.S. equity sector. I maintain my bullish targets for Bitcoin: The first is at $120–130K, as current demand exceeds halving-based models, fueled by regulatory optimism. I’m concerned that all this enthusiasm is coming right before a new wave of negativity for the S&P 500. Bitcoin and the S&P have strong correlations during periods of high negative volatility. What do Bitcoin, stocks, and gold not have in common? Only Bitcoin has surpassed its all-time highs again, and its realized cap exceeds $900B for the first time. Coinciding with a curious anniversary, the Pizza Day , this record becomes even more theatrical. A theatricality that does not seem to characterize the other asset classes (or rather, unless it’s a drama); in fact, while stocks are stalling with Moody’s downgrade of the U.S. credit rating , bonds are plummeting, and gold remains below its highs, at the mercy of the risk-on wave, the only one to surpass its previous market cap is Bitcoin. It’s something to think about, but also something to smile at; considering that in our last update on Bitcoin , we ended with a provocative quote from Eugene Fama on the Capitalisn’t podcast: “Bitcoin will go to zero.” which sparked a lively discussion in the comments. Why is Bitcoin rising? A +40% since April 8th, which recalls President Donald Trump’s announcement of a pause in tariff levels . A logical connection that seems flawless, linking Bitcoin’s trend to the global economy, which drives the prevailing journalistic narrative. A narrative that, however, does not seem to be pushing other asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and commodities, equally high. Data by YCharts So what is, then, that added value, the real narrative driving Bitcoin whale demand? In my opinion, it is the expectation of favorable regulations from the administration. The real narrative movement supporting the inflow of about $7.45 billion into ETFs recorded since April 18th (which I identify as the start of the bull run) is the idea that there will indeed be regulatory action on stablecoins. Initially, it was the idea that President Donald Trump, in addition to “meetings” with the major holders of his memecoin, maybe during some dinner at his Washington golf club, would finally take a step forward toward that “new” monetary system. Now the reality: the GENIUS Act , a real action plan for the creation of a regulatory framework for stablecoins. What makes sense to expect if we follow this narrative? If this narrative is followed, it gives the perception of a different context, which, in my opinion, implies greater institutional acceptance. Interesting in this sense is the mindset shift of some of the biggest banking figures, such as Jamie Dimon himself (CEO of JPMorgan), who called it “ a fraud ,” only to become, six years later, one of the main players alongside BlackRock. But his radical change of opinion is just one among many, including Ray Dalio himself, or Larry Fink . Institutionalization will lead but is already leading, to greater adoption, which in my opinion can effectively make Bitcoin decorrelated from the assets typically referenced in an intermarket perspective: mainly gold (positively), the dollar (negatively), and Treasury yields (negatively). And I believe it's only a matter of time before its performance increasingly aligns with that of the S&P 500, naturally maintaining an amplified beta (which it already partly does, as we will see shortly). Data by YCharts That said, what to expect? In this article , I provided some targets derived from the study of the main mathematical models for Bitcoin. My personal reworking of that data had identified two target prices: the first is at $120–130K (based on the study of the rainbow chart), and the second is at $158K, following the stock-to-flow model. I am not changing the reference targets. BTCUSD - Target price (Seeking Alpha) For completeness, I had also calculated the halving price regression , highlighting how, if BTC-USD had followed this model (which described the past trend), it would have ended the cycle with the highs of the past few months (specifically just below $100K). The fact that it has broken the highs again, and with strength, shows how Bitcoin demand is actually supported by a narrative in addition to that of the halving (which mainly relies on Bitcoin as a safe haven), which I believe is precisely the “GENIUS Act fever.” Risk But let’s get to the heart of the article: the S&P 500 is struggling due to fiscal pressures from U.S. debt and the contraction of EPS, while Bitcoin is strongly breaking all-time highs on Pizza Day. Maybe it’s not the kind of phrase a proper “analyst” would use, but it’s a coincidence that actually worries me. Also because, didn’t we say that Bitcoin’s price would increasingly align with the S&P 500? Well, in that regard, I think it’s fundamental to know that, as of today, there is already a particular convergence in the movements of these two assets, but mainly at the negative extreme of the volatility distribution. Data by YCharts This basically means that when there is damage on the streets of Wall Street, there is also damage on-chain; a piece of evidence that could be interpreted as a risk, or rather, that I, personally, consider a risk: let’s say the dark side of institutionalization. And I know, the S&P 500, with the tariff rollback, has risen, but maybe it's also somewhat oblivious to the fiscal danger signaled by the surge in Treasuries and the Moody’s downgrade. And Bitcoin has done the same, replicating that movement with amplified beta. So I think that if the stock market mispriced the May recovery from a forward-looking perspective, any spikes in volatility (a crash of the S&P 500) would not benefit the price of Bitcoin. Conclusion I’ve been bullish on Bitcoin since my first coverage, and I believe the strong breakout of the all-time highs is an equally positive signal. I find it curious that it happened close to Pizza Day, a peculiar conjunction of events that usually makes me raise my antennas and think about a possible sudden and contrarian move. This is just a feeling I wanted to share with you and an element that I personally consider risky. But as they say in these cases, data stays, and opinions change. So, following a data-dependent approach, I maintain the previously identified targets, remaining particularly positive regarding the GENIUS Act as a catalyst.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4789343-bitcoin-fruit-of-genius-act-reflections-on-price-action?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","IBIT|BTC|BTC-USD",cryptocompare

While speaking at the consensus conferences, Hoskinson stressed the need for cryptocurrency projects to build a community-centered foundation to remain relevant in the highly competitive crypto ecosystem. The Cardano founder maintains a positive outlook for Bitcoin and Dogecoin in the long term, citing their existing community as key structures, designed to keep both projects at the forefront. “To be useful, you have to have good governance, you have to be adaptable as a complex adaptive system, and resilient, and grow, and ultimately, you have to have a community—you have to have people there. That’s why Doge will never die, Bitcoin will never die.” Hoskinson remarked . Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bitcoin (BTC) are primed for a price rally this week Meanwhile, in terms of price performance, both Bitcoin and Doge seem to be well-positioned for a price rally this week, according to market trends observed this weekend. Pseudonymous analyst Ali_Charts, known for picking up on bullish uptrends, has spotted a falling wedge, a bullish chart pattern typically formed during a downward trend, on the Dogecoin technical chart. The analyst added that the asset appears to be aiming for a 15% price move. In the last 30 days, DOGE has recorded an upsurge in buying pressure, resulting in steady upward movement for the asset.

2025-05-23T11:47:02.000Z,"Bitcoin Bulls Take the Lead as Buyers Dominate Exchange Activity","Bitcoin buyers are showing no signs of slowing down, even as the cryptocurrency continues to push into uncharted price territory. Recent data from onchain analytics firm CryptoQuant suggests that the latest surge to all-time highs is being met with unusual optimism, with buyers firmly in control of the market. The 90-day cumulative volume delta (CVD), which measures the net difference between buy and sell orders, indicates that buy-side pressure is once again dominant . According to CryptoQuant contributor Ibrahim Cosar, this renewed strength among buyers could signal that the uptrend may be far from over. “Buy orders have become dominant again,” Cosar noted. “This generally signals that the uptrend may continue.” Market Resilience Despite 50% Bitcoin Price Surge Bitcoin has surged more than 50% in less than two months, yet investor enthusiasm remains strong. Unlike previous bull cycles, this rally appears to be fueled by sustained buying interest rather than speculative hype. The CVD data shows that while sellers briefly held control earlier in the year—particularly leading into April when BTC/USD touched multimonth lows below $75,000—buyers have decisively taken over since May. Cosar explained that the market’s ability to absorb new all-time highs above $110,000 without a noticeable increase in sell orders reflects a deeper bullish sentiment. “As the price tests above $110K and reaches a new all-time high, buyers have not backed down,” he wrote, adding that this could pave the way for another upward breakout. Long-Term Holders Remain Unmoved Further reinforcing the strength of the current market, long-term Bitcoin holders have refrained from taking profits despite higher prices. According to data from Glassnode, daily profit-taking is currently half the level observed when Bitcoin first hit $100,000 in December 2024, even though prices are now 10% higher. Glassnode also reported a notable decrease in the activity of older coins, signaling that long-term holders are showing greater conviction. CryptoQuant echoed these findings, noting that Bitcoin’s momentum picked up after reclaiming the short-term holder average cost basis, just under $100,000. This level often acts as a critical “buy-the-dip” signal during bull markets.

The hacker wallets did not show any movements in the past day. Cetus is currently carrying only $37M in total liquidity locked, down from over $240M before the hack. Cetus lost most of its liquidity after a month of rapid growth and the expansion of meme token launches on SUI. | Source: DeFi Llama The wallets are mostly blocked and blacklisted from interacting with other ecosystem protocols. The Cetus hack can still mix or use decentralized anonymous protocols to obscure the origin of funds. Cetus hack exposes controversial SUI decision to block addresses In an unprecedented move, the SUI network sent out a patch code to all validators, who are actively ignoring transactions originating from the hacker addresses. The move was efficient in securing $160M of the funds, which were not yet bridged to Ethereum. This also exposed the reality of SUI validators, which were capable of coordinating based on an ad hoc decision. The SUI network is thus not considered censorship-free, in comparison to larger networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin. On the other hand, the fast consensus to block addresses was a solution against the loss of funds. SUI validators invoked a governance mechanism in which the decision to block the funds was not actually centralized, but was quickly accepted by all validators. Running a SUI validator node is deliberately expensive, requiring 30M staked SUI. The creation of a validator node either requires an early entry or the gathering of staking deposits from a wide circle of owners. SUI validators, however, are incapable of moving the funds from the addresses, requiring the hacker to build a new transaction to the predetermined wallet. SUI sinks further after the hack Since the hack, SUI has endured significant losses. The token is down over 7.5% to $3.87, although no SUI tokens were directly sold to exchanges. SUI open interest increased to $963M, with more traders longing the coin in expectation of a recovery. The relatively large DeFi hack did not affect the main chain’s operation. However, the SUI meme token market saw significant price anomalies and may take a while to recover. Daily active users on SUI fell from over 1.6M to around 360K in the past 24 hours, showing that the DeFi ecosystem was the main driver of adoption.

The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Solana (SOL) Solana has shown significant price movement recently. Over the past month, SOL's price surged by 31.04%, indicating strong upward momentum. In the last week, the price increased modestly by 1.28%, suggesting consolidation within the current range of $163.40 to $184.07. Technical indicators point toward continued bullishness. The Relative Strength Index is at 67.69, nearing overbought levels but still below the threshold. The high Stochastic value of 93.41 suggests overbought conditions in the short term. The MACD level of 2.29 indicates positive momentum. The 10-day Simple Moving Average at $175.90 is above the 100-day average of $168.83, confirming an upward trend. Looking ahead, SOL could test the nearest resistance at $194.76 and possibly the second resistance at $215.43. Reaching these levels would represent potential gains of around 10% and 17% respectively from the current price. On the downside, the nearest support is at $153.42. A drop to this support would be about a 6% decrease. Given the recent gains and positive indicators, SOL shows potential for further growth, though the overbought signals warrant caution. Aptos (APT) Aptos (APT) has experienced notable price movements recently. In the past week, its price dropped by 5.19%, fluctuating between $4.64 and $5.99. Over the last month, however, APT rose by 10.61%, showing signs of recovery. Looking back six months, the price has decreased by 56.47%, indicating a significant long-term downtrend. Technical analysis points to crucial resistance and support levels ahead. The nearest resistance is at $6.79, and breaking this could lead to testing the second resistance at $8.13. On the flip side, the nearest support lies at $4.10, with a deeper support at $2.75. Movements toward these levels could define APT's short-term direction. The Simple Moving Averages over 10 and 100 days are $5.36 and $5.16 respectively, showing slightly positive momentum. The Relative Strength Index is at 66.62, close to overbought territory, and the Stochastic indicator is high at 92.69, suggesting overbought conditions. The MACD level of 0.0598 hints at bullish momentum. These indicators suggest that APT's price may face resistance soon, potentially leading to a correction or a consolidation phase. Sui (SUI) Sui (SUI) has been on a remarkable run lately. In the past week, the coin's price increased by 6.29%. Over the last month, it soared by an impressive 89.53%. Even over the past six months, SUI has seen a significant rise of 16.72%. These figures indicate strong momentum and growing interest in the coin. Currently, SUI is trading between $3.63 and $4.28. It's positioned above both its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $4.03 and $3.86, respectively. This suggests a bullish trend. The Relative Strength Index stands at 69.98, nearing overbought territory, while the Stochastic indicator is at 88.86, which also points to potential overbought conditions. The MACD level is positive at 0.0612, reinforcing the upward momentum. Looking ahead, the nearest resistance level is at $4.61. If SUI breaks through this point, it could aim for the second resistance at $5.26, which would be an increase of approximately 23% from its current high. On the downside, the nearest support level is $3.31. Falling below this could see the coin testing the second support at $2.67, a drop of about 38% from its current low. Based on recent performance and technical indicators, SUI may continue to rise, but investors should be mindful of the overbought signals. Conclusion While SOL, APT, and SUI promise growth with xBTC's arrival, XYZVerse (XYZ), the pioneering all-sport memecoin, presents greater potential with its unique blend of memes and sports.

2025-05-23T11:39:07.000Z,"Why Isn’t XRP Pumping? The Real Reason Behind the Silence","The post Why Isn’t XRP Pumping? The Real Reason Behind the Silence appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP is everywhere in the news, from Ripple’s new partnerships to major tech upgrades. Despite of all, XRP’s price has stayed stuck between $2 and $2.90. So what’s happening? Why hasn’t the price taken off yet? Let’s break it down. Big News, But No Big Pump Over the past few weeks, Ripple (XRP) has been in the spotlight for all the right reasons. Ripple is pushing ahead with major plans, from tokenizing real-world assets to launching new tools like RLUSD and EVM-compatible sidechains. On top of that, big names in finance are getting involved, and progress on regulation is finally taking shape. With this kind of news, many expected XRP’s price to skyrocket. But instead, it’s been mostly quiet in between the range of $2 to $2.90 . Infrastructure First, Price Later The truth is, XRP isn’t pumping because Ripple is still laying the foundation. What we’re seeing now is the building of financial “plumbing.” It’s not flashy, but it’s critical. Ripple is focusing on things like: Making sure they follow all rules and regulations Connecting with banks Creating systems for moving money easily Making it easy to buy and sell XRP Building safe storage for big investors These steps may not make headlines or boost the price right away, but they’re very important. Once everything is ready, it could lead to big growth and much more demand for XRP in the future. Spot ETF Rumors Fuel Hope One of the biggest reasons for long-term excitement is the possibility of a spot XRP ETF . After Bitcoin and Ethereum got the green light for similar products, XRP investors believe their turn could be next. The successful launch of an XRP futures ETF has only made that hope stronger. If a spot ETF gets approved, many believe it could drive a real price breakout — possibly pushing XRP above the $3 mark. Building Pipes, Not Just Hype While ripple isn’t chasing quick hype, they’re building a system. Regulatory setups, banking integrations, liquidity solutions, all of this takes time. And while it may not move prices today, it sets the stage for massive, sustainable growth later. That’s when the price could truly take off, not from hype, but from real-world utility. Because when the infrastructure is ready, and demand finally meets XRP’s finite supply, the move won’t be small.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-isnt-xrp-pumping-the-real-reason-behind-the-silence/,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING|XRP","News",cryptocompare

Finally, Arthur Hayes, who supported Hyperliquid's native token HYPE, made a $100 price prediction for HYPE. Following Hayes’ post, the HYPE price rose by more than 16% in the last 24 hours, reaching $32.50 as momentum began to rise sharply. Hayes cited popular trader James Wynn’s recent profits after he opened a massive $1.1 billion long Bitcoin position on Hyperliquid using 40x leverage. He noted that Wynn’s move shows increased confidence in Hyperliquid’s trading infrastructure and that top investors are heavily invested in the company’s future. “This is the best advertisement for HYPE. Let's take this altcoin to $100.” Known for his bold cryptocurrency predictions, Arthur Hayes’ call for HYPE to reach $100 attracted serious attention. This increased interest in HYPE and was reflected positively in the price. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-23T11:36:58.000Z,"This Trader Bet $1B on Bitcoin, Says Asset Is Dying to Break Out Higher","Bitcoin (BTC) has been on a roll in the past few days, surpassing its previous all-time high (ATH) and recording a new one above $111,900. While the crypto asset continues on this price trajectory, some traders are betting big on its next targets. One whale, the pseudonymous investor James Wynn, has bet $1.1 billion on BTC with 40x leverage on the decentralized layer-1 chain HyperLiquid. He has lived up to his reputation as a high-risk leverage trader and meme coin maxi by consistently increasing his exposure to BTC and other projects (including Ethereum, Sui, and Pepe) that he believes have potential. Trader Bets Big on BTC Wynn entered the long Bitcoin position about a week ago with less than $390 million and an average price of roughly $103,000. The bet initially had a liquidation price of $96,600 and a margin of $9.7 million. As the price of BTC rose, the whale continued to increase his position on the bet. A series of tweets from the market analytics platform Lookonchain revealed that the bet eventually increased to $415 million, $673 million, and even $900 million. At $900 million, Wynn’s bet ranked first on HyperLiquid, surpassing the combined positions of the next six traders. On May 21, the position exceeded 10,000 BTC and became worth $1.1 billion. After bitcoin broke through $111,900, the bet surged to $1.14 billion and was sitting on an unrealized profit of more than $39 million. Wynn Sits on $14M Unrealized Profit As Wynn increased his bet, he also took profits, with his latest sale on May 22 – $60 million worth of BTC to realize a profit of $1.5 million. BTC has retraced a bit since hitting an ATH, so the value of the bet has declined to around $800 million. However, at the time of writing, he was still sitting on an unrealized profit of at least $14 million despite having taken profits of more than $17 million. Talking about his position and profit-taking strategy, Wynn said BTC is dying to break out higher. He believes the cryptocurrency could hit the $115,000 to $118,000 target by the end of next week or even within hours in the coming days. The whale insists there is a major psychological support at $100,000. Once bitcoin tops around the $118,000 to $122,000 range, there will likely be a cool-off and some sideways movement. Afterward, the market could witness interesting trends as the altcoin season begins.

2025-05-23T11:31:41.000Z,"Bitcoin's new all-time high has traders asking: Is BTC price overheating at $111K?","Key takeaways: Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22, but retraced to $110,700, with analysts noting mixed signals on market overheating. Funding rates and other metrics suggest a “healthy upward phase.” Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) price recorded a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22. However, BTC price retraced shortly after to trade at $110,700 at the time of writing. Despite the correction, there are mixed signals about whether the price rally is overheated or whether this is a healthy pullback. Bitcoin “still not overheated” — analyst Bitcoin is not showing any signs of being overheated despite reaching new all-time highs this week, with several analysts pointing to fundamentals suggesting Bitcoin could rise further . “Overheating indicators such as the funding rate and short-term capital inflow remain low compared to previous peaks, and profit-taking by short-term investors is limited,” said CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan in a May 22 Quicktake note. Crypto Dan pointed out that Bitcoin’s funding rate, an indicator of market overheating, shows an increase in long bets. However, these bets “remain much smaller compared to previous peaks,” suggesting “futures market overheating is negligible.” Bitcoin funding rates and STH SOPR. Source: CryptoQuant A spike in Bitcoin funding rates can sometimes cause worry among market participants about increased Bitcoin volatility and liquidation risks. Still, the funding rates are moderately positive, signaling that traders are optimistic about Bitcoin’s price and buyers are willing to pay sellers a fee to hold their positions. Meanwhile, the short-term holder (STH) Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) metric reveals that despite STHs returning to profit, few have taken profits during the recent rise . This indicator is currently valued at 1.02%, suggesting that STHs are realizing some profits at much lower rates. “In March 2024, there was significant profit-taking and a prolonged correction, but currently, profit-taking is much lower than in November 2024,” the analyst explained, adding that despite the price at all-time highs, whales’ profit-taking activity remains relatively subdued. CryptoQuant’s Crypto Dan expected Bitcoin to continue rising higher, noting: “Overall, the Bitcoin market is still in a healthy upward phase.” Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s MVRV Z-score value — a metric that compares BTC’s market value to its realized value and adjusts for volatility — has seen a notable surge over the last month. Historically, all previous Bitcoin bull runs started with a notable surge in MVRV Z-score and ended with the metric entering the red zone (see chart below) to signal that Bitcoin is significantly overvalued. At 2.8, the MVRV Z-score is still significantly below the red zone, suggesting that the market top is not yet in . Bitcoin’s MVRV Z-score.

Source: Alternative.me When investors get too “greedy,” the market is often overdue for a correction. The last time this index was at similar levels was at the height of the Trump-driven pump in December 2024, just before BTC dropped down from its then -all-time high of around $108,000 and tumbled toward $74,000 in March. Related: Bitcoin buyer dominance at $111K suggests 'another wave' of gains Even though these metrics are cautioning market participants to manage risks, it is important to note that RSI conditions do not guarantee a trend reversal.

2025-05-23T11:30:39.000Z,"XRP Ready To Detonate—Analyst Sees 470% Surge On Deck","As Bitcoin extends its parabolic climb past $110,000, a closely followed crypto analyst is sounding the alarm for what could be XRP’s most explosive breakout in years. 470% XRP Rally Reloaded? In a market breakdown published on May 22, Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk)—who has been tracking inverse correlations between the dollar index (DXY) and Bitcoin—told followers that XRP is approaching a critical moment in its historical pattern. Drawing on technical signals and liquidity metrics, the analyst argued that XRP could replicate its late 2020-style breakout, which saw a 470% rally in just 28 days. “Bitcoin is at all-time highs,” he said at the start of the video. “Now we need to lock in because where things could get really exciting is what’s next.” His focus quickly shifted to XRP, which he believes is tracing a setup eerily similar to a period that preceded its 5x surge. The analyst highlighted a “substantial break of the range” on XRP’s chart that historically has marked the start of altseason. “This is the area where XRP outperformed the market,” he noted, referring to a 28-day span starting November 5 during which XRP surged from $0.50 to over $2.70. Related Reading: XRP Price To See 64,000% Rally To $1,700? Analysts Reveal End Of Year Predictions He pointed out that XRP’s historical outperformance came immediately after Bitcoin made a clean break above resistance, and critically, during a sharp decline in Bitcoin dominance—a metric that tracks Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. “This was the drop that saw XRP move up from 50 cents to $2.70, and then continue to $3.30,” he said. “Now we’re watching for signs of that again.” According to the analysis, XRP’s bullish potential hinges on a few key technical signals aligning. First, he noted a possible bullish divergence forming on the RSI (Relative Strength Index) of the XRP/ETH and XRP/BTC pairs, which could suggest that bearish momentum is fading even as price pulls back. “It’s essentially showing that even though price is going lower, momentum is not there to the downside,” he explained. Related Reading: Massive XRP Selling Pressure Is Stalling Price Action, Analyst Warns The analyst also emphasized the importance of daily closes above certain resistance levels, particularly $2.43 and $2.60, to confirm the start of a renewed uptrend. “That would be a nice daily close… and then we’re targeting $2.60. If we break above that, we’re confirming a new higher high, higher low structure,” he said, adding that the next major resistance lies between $3.40 and $3.00—beyond which, price discovery could begin. Altcoin Season Incoming Beyond XRP, he warned that broader market dynamics also support a shift into altcoins. “What we’ve seen is more and more people trying to short local tops. That takes us higher,” he explained. He cited rising short positions above current price levels as evidence of “pain liquidity”—a squeeze dynamic that could force price action sharply upward. While the rally has begun with Bitcoin, he believes altcoins are poised to follow, with Ethereum already showing signs of rotation. “We want Bitcoin dominance to kind of hold while price moves up,” he said, “and then for liquidity to rotate into altcoins.” Still, Cryptoinsightuk urged caution. “It’s a day to be excited, not a day to rush into trades,” he said. “This is why I’ve been screaming all year to buy the dip,” he added, “whether in XRP, ENA or whatever you want. The setup is here.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.445.

As more tech firms turn to Bitcoin as a treasury asset, Sweden’s health tech company H100 Group AB has followed suit, with a $490,000 buy that sent its shares soaring almost 40%. In a press release , the Stockholm-headquartered company said it had acquired 4.39 Bitcoin ( BTC ) at a price of 1,138,737 NOK each. The company said the allocation is part of a “long-term Bitcoin Treasury Strategy,” adding that the decision “doesn’t affect H100’s core operations, which remain focused on delivering technology solutions to health providers” as it reflects a “strategic deployment of excess liquidity to strengthen the company’s financial position.” “This addition to H100’s Bitcoin Treasury Strategy follows an increasing number of tech-oriented growth companies holding Bitcoin on their balance sheet, driven by the view that it’s in the company’s interest to hold a more diversified treasury portfolio than just cash.” H100 Group CEO Sander Andersen You might also like: CoinShares launches educational campaign targeting Swedish investors After the purchase, H100 Group’s shares on the Nordic Growth Market surged 39.27% to 1.22 Swedish Krona (about $0.13), boosting the company’s market value to approximately $14.84 million. In mid-April, two Swedish lawmakers urged the country’s finance minister to consider adding Bitcoin to Sweden’s reserves. Sweden Democrat Member of the Riksdag Dennis Dioukarev and MP Rickard Nordin have issued open letters to Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson, pushing for a national strategy that embraces Bitcoin as part of the country’s future financial planning. Dioukarev’s letter, submitted on April 14, proposed that Sweden begin accumulating Bitcoin using confiscated crypto assets. He pointed to similar efforts in other countries, notably the United States, which recently launched a national Bitcoin reserve funded through seized funds.

2025-05-23T11:25:48.000Z,"Singaporean Investors Are Increasing Their XRP Holdings","SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG), a popular researcher in the XRP community, recently highlighted a notable trend emerging from the May 2025 Independent Reserve Cryptocurrency Index (IRCI): Singaporean investors are increasing their XRP holdings. SMQKE drew attention to data showing a rise in XRP adoption among crypto investors in Singapore, citing its growing significance alongside Ripple’s stablecoin. Singaporean Investors are increasing their XRP holdings. https://t.co/ydq9PGwmXj pic.twitter.com/aK9H85ZVwb — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 22, 2025 XRP Among Top-Held Assets The IRCI report confirms that XRP is now held by 17% of Singaporean crypto investors, up from 14% in 2024. This positions XRP among the top five most-held cryptocurrencies in the country, alongside Bitcoin (68%), Ethereum (48%), Solana (19%), and Dogecoin (18%). The XRP community in Singapore has seen significant growth since Ripple acquired its digital payments license in 2023. The 3% increase Year-on-Year reflects a wider trend of diversification and maturation within investor portfolios. While Bitcoin retains dominance, the report notes that “ownership of alternative cryptocurrencies has increased significantly,” signaling a broadening interest in assets with distinct utility or growth potential. The data also shows that Singaporean crypto investors continue to diversify their holdings. In 2025, 65% of investors own between two and five different cryptocurrencies, up from 57% the year prior. This shift suggests more strategic and risk-aware investing behavior. RLUSD and XRP’s Institutional Influence RLUSD’s rise in prominence could bolster XRP’s renewed appeal. Commenting on RLUSD, SMQKE noted that Fiona Murray, Ripple’s APAC Managing Director, described RLUSD as “developed with high-value institutional utility and compliance at its core,” and she expects stablecoin adoption to continue growing. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 While RLUSD is not a direct investment vehicle for retail users, its infrastructure-based role complements XRP’s utility in payments and liquidity management. As institutional-grade digital assets like RLUSD become more prevalent, retail investors may increasingly turn to established network tokens such as XRP that serve adjacent functions within the same ecosystem. Younger Generations and Meme Coins The report also highlights that meme coins continue to draw attention, with 28% of investors holding at least one. Ownership is most concentrated among those aged 25–44, with the 35–44 and 25–34 groups each making up 30% and 28% of meme coin holders, respectively. This adoption can also benefit XRP, as there is a growing number of meme coins on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) . XRP’s Growing Role in a Shifting Landscape The IRCI data underlines XRP’s expanding role in Singapore’s evolving crypto investment landscape. As institutional digital finance infrastructure grows, investor interest appears to align more closely with tokens that can bridge retail and enterprise use cases, and XRP is the perfect fit.

2025-05-23T11:25:00.000Z,"Crypto Daybook Americas: Bitcoin Market Cap Tops $2.2T as Derivatives, Sentiment Signal More Upside","By James Van Straten (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin BTC is climbing up the asset ranks. The rally that this week took it to new highs has lifted its market capitalization to $2.2 trillion for the first time. It's already overtaken Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG) to become the world's fifth-largest asset and now sits behind iPhone maker Apple (APPL), software developer Microsoft (MSFT) and chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), all of which are valued at over $3 trillion. Way ahead is hard-to-produce, store-of-value gold at an estimated $22 trillion. Bitcoin’s No. 5 ranking reflects its growing status among traditional and institutional investors and comes as market sentiment turns decisively bullish, with strong buying action across all investor cohorts —from whales to minnows — and the BTC price holding steady around the $110,000 level with minimal pullbacks. As the end-of-May options expiry approaches next Friday, the options market reveals significant activity, with the bulk of call —or bullish — options positioned at the $110,000 strike price and a max pain level at $96,000. Looking into June , there's a clustering of high-strike call options at $200,000 and even $300,000. That's a solid sign of traders betting on continued upward momentum. Despite bitcoin’s strength, Strategy (MSTR), the largest corporate holder of bitcoin, has lagged in share price performance relative to its peers. The company recently announced a $2.1 billion at-the-market offering of its new perpetual preferred stock, STRF, intended to fund additional bitcoin acquisitions. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) continues to dominate the institutional market, pulling in $877 million in inflows on Thursday alone and bringing its total net inflow to a staggering $47.6 billion, according to Farside data . On the macroeconomic front, the largest cryptocurrency is showing clear divergence from traditional equities, rising 5% over the past five days while the S&P 500 has slipped by more than 1%. This uncorrelated performance is reinforcing bitcoin’s appeal as a macro hedge. Investors are now closely watching for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s speech on Sunday, which could prove pivotal in shaping next week’s market trajectory. Stay alert!

The team urged U.S. regulators to embrace DeFi principles to build safer, more efficient financial markets, highlighting Hyperliquid as a working example. The communication marks a rare instance of direct engagement between a DeFi-native protocol and a major U.S. regulator, signaling growing maturity in the sector. Hyperliquid framed its high-speed, permissionless trading infrastructure as a model that could outperform traditional finance standards. With whales like pseudonymous \""James Wynn\"" placing billion-dollar trades on the platform, regulatory recognition may add legitimacy and fuel further upside for HYPE. Derivatives Positioning Despite bitcoin hitting $110,000, perpetual funding rates remain low at 0.005%. They were at 0.04% in November, indicating the market isn’t overheated. Open interest in CME futures has risen 30K BTC since April,. That's still 40K BTC below November levels, reflecting relatively restrained institutional leverage.

The price action from mid-March to May is confined within a well-defined ascending channel, indicating a short-term bullish trend despite Strategy's recent pullback. The latest candles suggest a drop toward the lower boundary of the channel, which could act as a support level around the $6.10–$6.20 range.

2025-05-23T11:10:15.000Z,"Strong Asia FX Rises as US Dollar Eyes Weekly Loss","BitcoinWorld Strong Asia FX Rises as US Dollar Eyes Weekly Loss For those tracking global markets, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, understanding the broader economic currents is crucial. This week, the Forex market is showing some interesting shifts, particularly in Asia. We’re seeing Asia FX currencies gaining ground, while the US Dollar appears set for a weekly decline. A key player in this movement is the Japanese Yen , which has seen a significant boost following the latest Japan CPI data. Let’s dive into what’s happening and why it matters. What’s Behind the Softness in the US Dollar This Week? The US Dollar , often considered a safe haven currency, has been under pressure this week. Several factors seem to be contributing to its softer stance against a basket of major currencies, including those in Asia. While the exact reasons can be complex and influenced by daily news flow, some overarching themes include: Market Sentiment: A general improvement in global risk sentiment can sometimes lead investors away from safe-haven assets like the dollar towards currencies perceived as riskier but potentially offering better returns. Federal Reserve Expectations: Shifting expectations about the Federal Reserve’s future interest rate policy play a significant role. Any indication that the Fed might be closer to cutting rates, or less likely to hike further, tends to weigh on the dollar. Recent economic data or commentary from Fed officials can influence these expectations. Yield Differentials: The difference in interest rates between the US and other countries impacts currency attractiveness. If yields elsewhere become more competitive relative to US yields, capital flows can shift, affecting the dollar’s value. This weakening trend in the US Dollar provides a window for other currencies, especially those in robust economies, to appreciate. The Japanese Yen’s Boost from Strong Japan CPI Perhaps the most notable movement this week among Asia FX is the strengthening of the Japanese Yen . This surge is largely attributed to the release of stronger-than-expected Japan CPI (Consumer Price Index) data. CPI is a key inflation gauge, and higher inflation numbers can signal to the central bank (the Bank of Japan – BoJ) that it might need to adjust its monetary policy. Here’s why the Japan CPI data is significant for the Japanese Yen : Indicator Significance Potential BoJ Action Rising Core CPI Indicates persistent inflation pressures, moving closer to the BoJ’s target. Could prompt the BoJ to tighten monetary policy (e.g., raise interest rates, reduce stimulus). Impact on Yen Higher interest rates make a currency more attractive to foreign investors seeking yield. Increased demand for the Japanese Yen , leading to appreciation. Japan has long grappled with deflation, so consistent signs of inflation, as shown by strong Japan CPI , are closely watched. The data fuels speculation that the Bank of Japan may be moving away from its ultra-loose monetary policy sooner rather than later, making the Japanese Yen more appealing. How Are Other Asia FX Currencies Faring? While the Japanese Yen has stolen some of the spotlight, other Asia FX currencies are also benefiting from the softer US Dollar environment. The performance varies across the region, influenced by local economic conditions, trade balances, and central bank policies. Generally, a weaker dollar makes imports cheaper for these countries (if priced in USD) and can make their exports relatively more competitive. It also potentially eases the burden of dollar-denominated debt. Examples of other Asia FX currencies showing resilience or gains might include: The Korean Won The Singapore Dollar The Taiwan Dollar The Chinese Yuan (though its movement is also heavily influenced by domestic policy) These currencies often move in concert to some extent, especially when a major global currency like the US Dollar is experiencing a broad trend. Navigating the Current Forex Market Landscape The current dynamics in the Forex market , with Asia FX gaining and the US Dollar softening, highlight the constant interplay of global economic data, central bank actions, and market sentiment. For investors and traders, understanding these relationships is key. Key takeaways for navigating this landscape: Monitor Economic Data: Keep a close eye on inflation data (like Japan CPI ), employment figures, and GDP reports from major economies, as these heavily influence central bank decisions. Follow Central Bank Commentary: Statements and decisions from central banks, particularly the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan, provide crucial clues about future monetary policy direction. Assess Risk Appetite: Broader market sentiment regarding risk can dictate flows into or out of safe-haven currencies like the US Dollar . While this analysis focuses on traditional fiat currencies, movements in the Forex market can have ripple effects across global asset classes, including potentially influencing capital flows and investor sentiment in the cryptocurrency space. Conclusion: Asia FX on the Rise, Dollar Retreats In summary, the current week is marked by a notable shift in the Forex market . Asia FX currencies, including the significantly strengthened Japanese Yen boosted by positive Japan CPI data, are appreciating against a softer US Dollar , which is on track for a weekly loss. This trend is driven by a combination of improving regional economic outlooks, shifting expectations around US monetary policy, and specific local data points like Japan’s inflation figures.

2025-05-23T11:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Prediction Analysts Agree: Bitcoin Solaris at $4 Mirrors Bitcoin at $1 in 2011 for Wealth Creation","In 2011, Bitcoin was trading at $1—and very few saw the future it was building. Fast forward to today, Bitcoin is a household name, but the days of exponential gains for small investors are long gone. Now, crypto analysts are pointing to a new opportunity that echoes that same 2011 energy: Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) at $4. Could this really be the next launchpad for wealth creation? Bitcoin: Proven Legacy, But Priced Out Bitcoin will always be the godfather of crypto. Its scarcity, security, and mass adoption have made it a powerful store of value. But for the average investor, the price has become a wall, not a window. Buying Bitcoin now means owning a fraction, not a movement. Mining Bitcoin requires expensive ASIC hardware and massive electricity. The returns are slow, reserved for whales and institutions. Bitcoin Solaris: The $4 Moment That Feels Like Bitcoin at $1 Bitcoin Solaris at $4 is igniting conversations across the crypto space. And it’s not just hype—it’s architecture, accessibility, and aggressive upside that make this different. BTC-S core features: Dual consensus: PoW for security, DPoS for scalability 10,000 transactions per second Finality in 2 seconds 99.95% less energy use than Bitcoin Mobile mining through the upcoming Solaris Nova App These aren’t just buzzwords. They’re what make Bitcoin Solaris not just a project, but a platform for wealth creation—accessible to anyone with a smartphone. BTC-S vs Bitcoin Mining: Why the New Model Wins Feature Bitcoin Mining Bitcoin Solaris Mining Hardware Cost Thousands of dollars None – just a smartphone Setup Difficulty Complex, technical One-tap mobile app Energy Use Extremely high 99.95% lower Accessibility Limited to experts Open to everyone Daily Profitability Slower and expensive Faster and mobile Turn Your Phone into a Passive Income Machine Why the Bitcoin Solaris Presale Is Exploding We’re now in Phase 4 of the BTC-S presale , and momentum is hitting hard: Current Price: $4 Next Phase: $5 Launch Price: $20 Bonus: 12% But beyond the numbers, the movement is real. The presale only runs for 90 days. The launch date is July 31, 2025, with over $1.2 million raised so far and 8,900+ users already onboard. Analysts are calling it one of the shortest and most explosive presales of the year. Select community members are currently testing the beta version of the Solaris Nova App, but the official release is still ahead, meaning there’s still room to join before the window closes. Analyst Attention Is Heating Up Influencers and enthusiasts are calling attention to the similarities between Bitcoin Solaris at $4 and Bitcoin’s early price trajectory. A detailed review by Token Galaxy outlines why BTC-S may be the closest thing to Bitcoin’s 2011 window we’ll see again, focusing on accessibility, architecture, and early-entry potential. The Path Ahead Is Clear Bitcoin Solaris isn’t flying under the radar anymore. The roadmap speaks volumes, focused on laying a powerful foundation ahead of its full ecosystem launch. Key initiatives include: Mainnet launch with full governance and app integration (Q3 2026) Institutional-grade custody solutions and enterprise adoption (2027) Launch of a DEX, a mining power marketplace, and quantum-resistant technology These early efforts are setting the stage for what comes next: testnet rollout, wallet deployment, and mainnet preparation in 2026 The project is also audited by Cyberscope and Freshcoins , and has completed full KYC verification , adding layers of security and legitimacy. Final Thoughts: $4 Today Could Be $400 Tomorrow If you missed Bitcoin at $1, this is your reset button. Bitcoin Solaris at $4 mirrors Bitcoin at $1 in 2011, not just in price, but in potential. And as history shows, wealth creation favors the early movers, not the spectators.

Wynn recently claimed to have earned $46 million from his Bitcoin positions to date. Hyperliquid whale James Wynn, who shared the latest status of his profile from the X account, said that he started making profits in the range of $ 110,000-111,000 in Bitcoin. Wynn said that despite the small pullback, Bitcoin will continue to rise and that he expects Bitcoin to reach $115,000-118,000 very soon. Stating that Bitcoin will probably rise to $122,000, Wynn stated that he expects a period of consolidation after this peak and believes that this will pave the way for the next altcoin season. “I reduced the position size today, making a profit of around $110,000 – $111,000. In my opinion, Bitcoin is itching to go higher. My goal remains the same at 115-118k by next weekend. However, it could easily happen in just a few hours. I think Bitcoin will reach 118k-122k and we will see a cooling and sideways movement, then things will get really interesting and alt season will come.” He Said Altcoin Season Is Coming: Ethereum After Bitcoin! Known for his high-risk transactions, big whale James Wynn opened a long position in Ethereum after Bitcoin. According to Lookonchain’s post, James Wynn recently made a bold move on Ethereum, opening a 25x leveraged long position worth $60.4 million at an entry price of $2,666.31. “Top trader James Wynn opened a long position on Ethereum with 25x leverage. His position reached 22,548 ETH ($60.4 million). Entry price: $2,666.31 / Unrealized profit: $270K” In addition to Bitcoin and Ethereum, Wynn has a $26.77 million long position in memecoin kPEPE with 10x leverage. That position remains active and in profit. However, not all of Wynn’s trades are in the green. A 10x leveraged long position on SUI is currently in the red.

2025-05-23T10:53:35.000Z,"$APT price outlook improves as Aptos stablecoin supply jumps 160%","Cryptocurrencies display momentum as Bitcoin holds above $111K, with many altcoins on the verge of impressive breakouts . Aptos is among the tokens stealing the show, and it might be the right time to check what to expect from its price actions in the upcoming sessions. Two crucial signals -a historic recurring price pattern and on-chain growth – hint at massive surges for $APT. Notably, native stablecoin supply on Aptos’ network has tripled from $430 million to $1.13 billion in 2025 alone, signaling amplified user activity and on-chain liquidity. Moreover, $APT’s current price of $5.88 places it within the key region of $5 – $7, which had previously triggered 2x – 4x price gains. Let us take a closer look. Stablecoin supply on Aptos up 160% in five months Aptos has witnessed impressive growth this year, partially driven by developments such as APT ETF filings and the maturing crypto industry. Token Terminal data shows stablecoin supply within the APT ecosystem has mushroomed from around $430 million to surpass $1.13 billion since January 2025. Source: tokenterminal The 160% surge includes USD Coin and USDT natively minted on the blockchain. Tether’s stablecoin dominated early growth, and Circle’s product flourished in the second quarter. The surged stablecoin issuance is beyond numbers. It often signals soaring user activity and on-chain liquidity. These trends mean more funds entering the crypto’s network, possibly for initiatives like NFTs, DeFi, and native coin $APT. That positions the altcoin for impressive growth and stable price actions. Moreover, the chart shows the supply has increased sharply since January without significant pullbacks. That highlights growing trust from institutional and retail participants within the Aptos platform. $APT price outlook: historical pattern signals explosive moves Besides stablecoin data, the altcoin displayed attention-grabbing patterns on the price chart. Historical data shows $APT has seen prolonged consolidation at $5 – $7, what most analysts call an accumulation territory. Aptos has witnessed three notable cases within the range. The initial consolidation happened between May and October 2023. It repeated that in May – October 2024 and from November 2024 to March 2025. Notably, significant breakouts emerged after each phase, with the recent one (after March 2025) catalyzing a 300% uptick in APT price. The altcoin climbed from $5.48 to $20.44 after a 119-day consolidation. Now, APT hovers at the crucial area, trading at $5.88 during this publication. Chart by Coinmarketcap Should we brace for surges to the $20 mark? Previous trends suggest so. While relying on history could be dangerous in the volatile crypto space, Aptos’ case has recurred thrice. Thus, $APT appears ready for a 2x – 4x uptick, with surging trading volumes and prevailing broad market sentiments supporting the short-term bullish case. Bitcoin’s candle closing above $110K would be crucial to keep altcoins afloat for continued rallies.

Robinhood @RobinhoodApp · Follow Moo Deng $MOODENG and cat in a dog’s world $MEW are now available to trade on Robinhood. 11:32 PM · May 22, 2025 0 Reply Copy link Read more on Twitter The surprise listing has sent shockwaves across the crypto community, driving both tokens into massive rallies and reigniting interest in the Solana memecoin space. With Robinhood’s expanding crypto portfolio, traders are eyeing the next big breakout, and many believe that Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) , which is days away from its first CEX listing, could be the one to watch. Robinhood listing pushed Moo Deng and MEW to new highs Within hours of the Robinhood listing, both memecoins saw explosive price action, with Moo Deng leading the charge by nearly touching its all-time high. Notably, MOODENG, a Solana-based memecoin, has skyrocketed nearly 750% in May alone, gaining traction ahead of the Robinhood listing and accelerating further upon confirmation. The coin, which had been flying under the radar, broke out from a descending resistance line in early April and validated it as support, triggering a parabolic rally. As of the latest update, Moo Deng is trading at $0.2994, having reached an intraday high of $0.3251, just shy of its previous all-time high of $0.6804. Its 24-hour trading volume surpassed $882 million, with a market capitalization just under $300 million, signaling intense investor interest. Technical analysis shows mixed signals, with price action suggesting a possible breakout but momentum indicators like RSI and MACD warning of potential bearish divergences. However, despite the caution, wave pattern analysis suggests that MOODENG may still be in the middle of a five-wave rally, possibly heading toward a new all-time high in the coming days. On the other hand, MEW, another Solana token that had been relatively dormant since late 2024, surged over 25% following its Robinhood debut. Currently priced at $0.00465, MEW has clawed back from a prolonged consolidation period and now sits only 64% below its all-time high of $0.01288 set last November. With a fully diluted valuation of $411 million and an active trading volume north of $350 million, MEW is now firmly back on the radar of speculative traders. Although some social media users expressed concerns about potential manipulation following the listing, no concrete evidence has emerged to support those claims. Instead, the listings appear to be part of Robinhood’s broader strategy to grow its crypto footprint after the SEC probe closure earlier this year. Attention now turns to Bitcoin Pepe ahead of its first CEX listing The success of Moo Deng and MEW has reignited a speculative frenzy across the memecoin market, shifting investor focus toward the next potential breakout. As the dust settles from the Robinhood-induced MOODENG and MEW surge, market attention is now shifting toward Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) , a fast-rising memecoin positioning itself as the next breakout candidate. Although Bitcoin Pepe is yet to get listed on centralised exchanges, its community and presale momentum have made it a top contender for the next viral run. Built on Bitcoin Layer 2 infrastructure, Bitcoin Pepe fuses the cultural impact of Pepe the Frog with the credibility and narrative of Bitcoin, creating a memecoin that blends humour, nostalgia, and innovation. Bitcoin Pepe’s unique appeal stems from its hybrid branding, which resonates across both Gen Z and seasoned crypto investors familiar with meme culture and Bitcoin’s ideological roots. Unlike many memecoins that rely solely on hype, Bitcoin Pepe has crafted a multi-stage roadmap that includes staking, NFTs, and long-term ecosystem development. The project’s emphasis on transparency, token utility, and organic growth has attracted a diverse community that sees BPEP as more than just a short-term play. With Moo Deng and MEW now listed, many investors believe Bitcoin Pepe is next in line for a major exchange debut, potentially unlocking exponential upside. Several early backers and influencers are speculating that BPEP, which is currently valued at $0.0359 in its last presale stage , could match or even exceed MOODENG’s 750% rally once its first CEX listing is confirmed. According to the project’s roadmap, we only have eight days left before the presale comes to an end and the token gets its first CEX listing. Given the recent success of Solana memecoins, Bitcoin Pepe’s Bitcoin-native approach offers a fresh alternative that stands out in a crowded market. Furthermore, the timing of its rise could not be more perfect, as meme narratives are dominating retail attention and traders are hungry for the next explosive move. Anticipation is building rapidly, and with exchange rumours swirling, FOMO appears to be creeping in across crypto Twitter and major Telegram groups. The sentiment is clear: Bitcoin Pepe represents the next major test of memecoin momentum in this volatile but opportunity-rich market. If BPEP’s debut is even half as successful as MOODENG’s, it could solidify its place as a defining meme asset of this market cycle.

Trump’s sons — Eric and Donald Jr. —are involved in the management of the company.Zhao said the WSJ article portrayed him as acting as a “fixer” for the WLF team and its co-founder Zach Witkoff during foreign trips. The article suggested Zhao facilitated introductions and meetings for WLF leaders during foreign trips, including a visit to Pakistan that reportedly resulted in a memorandum of understanding with a local official.“I am not a fixer for anyone,” Zhao said, firmly denying that he connected Pakistani official “Mr. Saqib” with WLF or organized any engagements abroad. “They had known each other way back, whereas I only met with Mr. Saqib for the first time in Pakistan.” Source: Changpeng ZhaoWSJ reports on Steve and Zach WitkoffZhao’s response follows a WSJ investigation highlighting a complex string of diplomatic and business interests involving WLF. The report raised concerns about the blurred lines between public duties and private interests and focused on diplomatic and business dealings involving WLF co-founders Steve Witkoff and his son, Zach Witkoff. Steve Witkoff serves as the US Special Envoy to the Middle East under the Trump administration, while Zach Witkoff has been involved in securing a reported $2 billion crypto deal.The report raised questions about whether diplomatic efforts overlapped with private crypto ventures, and implied Zhao may have been attempting to curry favor with the Trump administrationOn May 6, Zhao confirmed that he is seeking a pardon from the Trump administration for his earlier money laundering conviction. The report also highlighted that WLFI, which raised over $600 million in token sales, does not disclose the names of all its investors aside from some publicly known ones like Tron founder Justin Sun, who attended Trump’s memecoin dinner on May 22. Trump hosted the dinner for the largest investors of his Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin.

He said the forces behind the publication want to hinder efforts to make the US a crypto capital. “They want to attack crypto, global crypto leaders and the pro-crypto administration,” CZ claimed, saying the article is part of a broader effort to stifle the industry’s growth in the US.This is not the first time Zhao has clapped back at the WSJ recently. In an April 11 report, the publication cited anonymous sources alleging that Zhao agreed to testify against Tron founder Justin Sun as he settled with US prosecutors. CZ dismissed the report, saying that people who become government witnesses don’t go to prison and are protected.

However, BTC price retraced shortly after to trade at $110,700 at the time of writing. Despite the correction, there are mixed signals about whether the price rally is overheated or whether this is a healthy pullback. Bitcoin “still not overheated” — analystBitcoin is not showing any signs of being overheated despite reaching new all-time highs this week, with several analysts pointing to fundamentals suggesting Bitcoin could rise further.“Overheating indicators such as the funding rate and short-term capital inflow remain low compared to previous peaks, and profit-taking by short-term investors is limited,” said CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan in a May 22 Quicktake note. Crypto Dan pointed out that Bitcoin’s funding rate, an indicator of market overheating, shows an increase in long bets.

Online banks, he said, spend about $20 to $30. In contrast, DeFi requires almost nothing beyond a smartphone and internet access.“Onboarding to DeFi literally costs zero,” Bukov said. “You don’t need brick-and-mortar infrastructure or lengthy verification processes. Just connect and transact.” Bukov said that this gives DeFi an edge over traditional financial institutions in reaching the 1.4 billion unbanked people who remain excluded from traditional finance due to high onboarding expenses.1inch Network co-founder Anton Bukov at the Dutch Blockchain Week. Source: CointelegraphReaching 1.4 billion unbanked users“That’s why we have 1.4 billion people on the planet who are unbanked. No one’s going to invest those hundreds or tens of dollars into them because they will never return to them,” Bukov added. Unlike traditional finance, which has high barriers to entry, Bukov said DeFi allows the unbanked to become a part of the global economy and engage in real-life transactions using stablecoins like Tether’s USDt (USDT). With lower barriers to entry, DeFi becomes a tool for financial inclusion. Bukov said DeFi will continue to reach users who never had access to traditional banking as internet access expands globally. “You can just get a phone, access to the internet, and you can exchange your chicken for USDT,” Bukov said, highlighting how easily DeFi enables participation in the global economy. Related: Animoca’s Yat Siu says student loans can supercharge DeFi growthDeFi allows access to global liquidity Apart from financial inclusion, Bukov said that the real value of crypto lies in how it gives access to global liquidity. The 1inch co-founder said crypto is evolving into an independent economic zone, where hundreds of billions flow through decentralized protocols. “Crypto isn’t just about adopting stablecoins or building national digital currencies,” Bukov said. “It’s a growing global liquidity hub.”He said that this liquidity is dynamic and allows financial experimentation, yield strategies and cross-border capital movement. Bukov added that countries that align their regulations to enable easier access to this global liquidity can tap into economic opportunities and cooperation. “The more countries trade with each other, the more they succeed.

That’s the same kind of license traditional fintechs need to offer e-wallets or prepaid cards. It’s not cheap and it’s not quick. 2. Most of your reserves have to sit in European banksThis is one of the most controversial parts of MiCA. If you issue a “significant” stablecoin — and Tether’s USDT certainly qualifies — at least 60% of your reserves must be held in EU-based banks. The logic is to keep the financial system safe. 3. Full transparency is non-negotiableMiCA requires detailed, regular disclosures. Issuers have to publish a white paper and provide updates on their reserves, audits and operational changes. This level of reporting is new territory for some stablecoins, especially those that have historically avoided public scrutiny.4. Non-compliant coins are getting delistedIf a token doesn’t comply, it won’t be tradable on regulated EU platforms. Binance, for example, has delisted USDT trading pairs for users in the European Economic Area (EEA). Other exchanges are following suit.The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) clarified that people in Europe can still hold or transfer USDT, but it can’t be offered to the public or listed on official venues. In other words, you might still have USDT in your wallet, but good luck trying to swap it on a regulated platform.                  Key reasons why Tether rejects MiCA regulations              Tether is unique in that it has explained why it wants nothing to do with MiCA regulations. The company’s leadership, especially CEO Paolo Ardoino, has been pretty vocal about what they see as serious flaws in the regulation, from financial risks to privacy concerns to the bigger picture of who stablecoins are really for.1. The banking rule could backfireOne of MiCA’s most talked-about rules says that “significant” stablecoins — like Tether’s USDt (USDT) — must keep at least 60% of their reserves in European banks. The idea is to make stablecoins safer and more transparent. But Ardoino sees it differently.He’s warned that this could create new problems, forcing stablecoin issuers to rely so heavily on traditional banks could make the whole system more fragile. After all, if there’s a wave of redemptions and those banks don’t have enough liquidity to keep up, we’d witness a struggling bank and a stablecoin crisis simultaneously.Instead, Tether prefers to keep most of its reserves in US Treasurys, assets it says are liquid, low-risk and much easier to redeem quickly if needed.2. They don’t trust the digital euroTether also has a broader issue with the direction Europe is heading, especially regarding a digital euro. Ardoino has openly criticized it, raising alarms about privacy. He has argued that a centrally controlled digital currency could be used to track how people spend their money, and even control or restrict transactions if someone falls out of favor with the system.Privacy advocates have echoed similar concerns. While the European Central Bank insists that privacy is a top priority (with features like offline payments), Tether isn’t convinced. In their eyes, putting that much financial power in the hands of one institution is asking for trouble.3. Tether’s users aren’t in Brussels. They’re in Brazil, Turkey and NigeriaAt the heart of it, Tether sees itself as a lifeline for people in countries dealing with inflation, unstable banking systems and limited access to dollars. These are places like Turkey, Argentina and Nigeria, where USDT is often more useful than the local currency.MiCA, with all its licensing hoops and reserve mandates, would require Tether to shift focus and invest heavily in meeting EU-specific standards. That’s something the company says it’s not willing to do, not at the expense of the markets it sees as most in need of financial tools like USDT.Did you know? Turkey ranks among the top countries for cryptocurrency adoption, with 16% of its population engaged in crypto activities. This high adoption rate is largely driven by the devaluation of the Turkish lira and economic instability, prompting citizens to seek alternatives like stablecoins to preserve their purchasing power.                  What happens when Tether doesn’t comply with MiCA              Tether’s decision to skip MiCA didn’t exactly fly under the radar. It’s already having real consequences, especially for exchanges and users in Europe.Exchanges are dropping USDTBig names like Binance and Kraken didn’t wait around. To stay on the right side of EU regulators, they’ve already delisted USDT trading pairs for users in the European Economic Area. Binance had removed them by the end of March 2025. Kraken followed close behind, removing not just USDT but also other non-compliant stablecoins like EURT and PayPal’s PYUSD.Users are left with fewer optionsIf you’re in Europe and holding USDT, you’re not totally out of luck; you can still withdraw or swap it on certain platforms. But you won’t be trading it on major exchanges anymore. That’s already pushing users toward alternatives like USDC and EURC, which are fully MiCA-compliant and widely supported.Even major crypto payment processors are pulling support, leaving users with fewer options for spending their crypto directly.A hit to liquidity? Probably.Pulling USDT from European exchanges could make the markets a bit shakier. Less liquidity, wider spreads and more volatility during big price moves are all on the table. Some traders will adjust quickly. Others? Not so much.Did you know? Tether (USDT) is the most traded cryptocurrency globally, surpassing even Bitcoin in daily volume. In 2024, it facilitated over $20.6 trillion in transactions and boasts a user base exceeding 400 million worldwide.                  Tether vs MiCA regulation              Tether may be out of sync with the EU, but it’s far from retreating. If anything, the company is doubling down elsewhere, looking for friendlier ground and broader horizons.Firstly, Tether’s picked El Salvador as its new base, a country that has fully embraced crypto. After getting a digital asset service provider license, the company is setting up a real headquarters there. Ardoino and other top execs are making the move too.Moreover, after banking over $5 billion in profits in early 2024, Tether is putting its capital to work:AI: Through its venture arm, Tether Evo, the company has picked up stakes in firms like Northern Data Group and Blackrock Neurotech. Tether has also launched Tether AI, an open-source, decentralized AI platform designed to operate on any device without centralized servers or API keys. The goal is to use AI to boost operations and maybe build some new tools along the way.Infrastructure and AgTech: Tether invested in Adecoagro, a company focused on sustainable farming and renewable energy. It’s a surprising move, but it fits Tether’s bigger strategy of backing real-world, resilient systems.Media and beyond: There are also signs Tether wants a footprint in content and communications, signaling it’s thinking far beyond crypto alone.                  Tether’s MiCA exit highlights crypto’s global regulatory chaos              Tether walking away from MiCA is a snapshot of a much bigger issue in crypto: How hard it is to build a business in a world where every jurisdiction plays by its own rulebook.The classic game of regulatory arbitrageThis isn’t Tether’s first rodeo when it comes to navigating regulations. Like many crypto companies, they’ve mastered the art of regulatory arbitrage, finding the friendliest jurisdiction and setting up shop there. Europe brings in strict rules? Fine, Tether sets up in El Salvador, where crypto is welcomed with open arms.However, it does raise questions. If big players can simply move jurisdictions to dodge regulations, how effective are those rules in the first place? And does that leave retail users protected or just further confused?A crypto world that’s all over the mapThe bigger issue is that the global regulatory landscape is incredibly fragmented. Europe wants full compliance, transparency and reserve mandates. The US is still sending mixed signals. Asia is split; Hong Kong is pro-crypto, while China stays cold. Hong Kong has also passed the Stablecoin Bill to license fiat-backed issuers and boost its Web3 ambitions. Meanwhile, Latin America is embracing crypto as a tool for financial access.For companies, it’s a mess. You can’t build for one global market; you must constantly adapt, restructure or pull out entirely. For users, it creates massive gaps in access. A coin available in one country might be inaccessible in another just because of local policy.As a final thought: Tether’s resistance to MiCA seems to be more than just a protest against red tape. It’s making a bet that crypto’s future will be shaped outside Brussels, not inside it.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/why-tether-refuses-to-comply-with-mica?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

This guide explores how to identify early winners by analyzing onchain metrics, tokenomics, dev activity and community traction while avoiding the common traps of hype-driven pumps and red-flag projects.Despite the crypto space being crowded, fast-moving and full of noise, some investors manage to consistently find promising projects while they’re still under the radar.So, how do they do it? Crypto trendspotters know how to read onchain data. They understand tokenomics. They read GitHub commits and follow the money. It takes more than jumping on the hype bandwagon ahead of the crowd.This guide breaks down how to find crypto projects with real potential using lessons from past winners like Solana, Arbitrum, Chainlink and even memecoins like Pepe. Along the way, it will highlight the tools that matter, red flags to avoid and the difference between organic growth and manufactured buzz.How the real winners took offSolanaWhen Solana launched in 2020, few outside of developer circles had heard of it. But it had one big edge: speed. Solana’s proof-of-history tech made it one of the fastest chains around, and it quickly became a magnet for builders, especially in DeFi and NFTs. By 2021, its ecosystem exploded with apps like Serum and Magic Eden.Early adopters who paid attention to onchain growth — like wallet activity and DEX volume — could see something brewing. Solana (SOL) went from under $1 to $50+ in less than a year. Arbitrum Arbitrum launched in 2021 as an Ethereum layer 2, but its big moment came with the Arbitrum (ARB) token airdrop in March 2023. At launch, Arbitrum was already processing more transactions than many layer 1s and had billions in total value locked (TVL) in decentralized applications (DApps).Smart investors were watching. Even before the token, the signs were there: user activity, rising liquidity and growing app adoption. When ARB dropped, the pump stuck because the foundation was real.ChainlinkChainlink is a classic example of a project with long-term utility. It doesn’t have flashy branding or meme power, but it does one thing incredibly well: feed real-world data into smart contracts.By 2024, it had become the backbone of much of DeFi, gaming and even tokenized real-world assets. If you were watching closely in 2019-2020, you saw LINK (LINK) getting integrated everywhere. That kind of early utility often flies under the radar — until price action catches up.PEPE Coin (PEPE)Let’s not pretend memes don’t matter. Pepe (PEPE) launched in 2023 with no roadmap, no utility and no VC backing. But it hit a nerve, and the internet ran with it. The coin hit a billion-dollar market cap within weeks.That kind of run is rare — and risky. But for traders tracking social sentiment, wallet distribution and community activity, the early signals were all there. PEPE didn’t promise anything, but it delivered returns by becoming a viral moment.How to find crypto gems earlySo, how do you separate the next Solana from the next rug pull? Here’s how serious trendspotters approach it.1. Start with onchain metricsPublic blockchains are transparent. Use that to look at:Daily active walletsTransaction volumeTokenholder growthLiquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs)TVL (for DeFi projects).If users and capital are moving in — before the token moons — that’s a great sign. Tools like Dune Analytics, Nansen and DefiLlama are your best friends here.2. Understand the tokenomicsAsk questions like:What’s the total supply? How much is circulating?Are there upcoming unlocks or vesting cliffs?Who holds the tokens, and how concentrated are the top wallets?Is there utility? Does the token do anything?Tokens with capped supply, smart incentives (like staking or burn mechanisms) and fair distribution models tend to do better long-term.3. Check developer activityIs the team actually building?GitHub is a goldmine. Look at how often code is pushed, how many contributors are active, and whether the repo looks alive. No updates for months? Big red flag.You don’t need to read code — just track commits and releases. Projects with real traction are always shipping.4. Look for ecosystem signalsAre other developers building on top of it? Are DApps launching? Is liquidity growing? Are users coming back week after week?Ecosystem growth is hard to fake, and it’s often the strongest early indicator that a project has legs.5. Follow the communityX, Discord, Telegram, Reddit — yes, it’s noisy. But it’s also where trends start. Look beyond the price talk:Are people actually using the product?Are devs answering questions?Is the tone constructive or just hype?Use LunarCrush or Santiment to track social momentum, but always double-check it with onchain data.Key tools to spot crypto trendsHere’s a quick rundown of the top platforms used by smart crypto trendspotters:Top tip: Don’t just use one tool. Great traders cross-reference everything.Crypto trend analysis 2025A coin might be flying, but is it because people are actually using it or just talking about it? Learning to tell the difference can save you from making a bad investment. Signs of real tractionSteady user growth and TVL over time: If users are showing up before a token pumps — and the numbers keep climbing week over week — that’s usually a sign of substance. You’ll often see this in DeFi protocols or layer 2s gaining trust slowly, not overnight.Code commits and product updates: A live GitHub with regular commits, active devs and visible progress means the team is building. This shows momentum and long-term focus — not just a marketing push.More tokenholders, less whale control: When new holders join steadily — and supply isn’t all locked up by the top five wallets — it’s a healthier setup. Distributed ownership reduces the risk of rug pulls or coordinated dumps.New integrations and ecosystem activity: If other apps are integrating the token or building on the protocol, it usually means the tech is solid and useful. This kind of network effect compounds fast and often precedes a breakout.Liquidity that builds slowly: Gradual increases in liquidity and trading volume tend to reflect real interest. If liquidity sticks around (rather than vanishing after a pump), it’s usually organic.Signs of manufactured hypeSudden spikes in social mentions or trading volume with no news: If the project is everywhere on X overnight, but there’s no product update, launch or roadmap shift, be skeptical. It’s likely a coordinated shill.Influencer spam and recycled talking points: When you see multiple anonymous influencers posting the same meme or catchphrase, that’s a signal someone’s trying to manufacture buzz.No dev activity or roadmap: If there’s no GitHub, no changelog and the team isn’t shipping anything, it’s probably just a hype machine.Anonymous team, outrageous promises: Combine a mystery team with claims like “100x guaranteed,” and you’re likely looking at a cash grab. Real builders let the work speak for itself.Rule of thumb: If the price is moving and everything else — users, devs, integrations — is standing still, you’re looking at hype. But when those fundamentals are quietly ticking up in the background? That’s when it’s worth a closer look.More red flagsSome projects look great on the surface — slick websites, trending hashtags, a fast-moving chart — but fall apart under the hood. Here are some more red flags to watch out for:High holder concentration: If most of the token is sitting in a handful of wallets, it doesn’t take much for a price crash. Whales often buy early and dump on retail.Unverified token contracts: A token that hasn’t been verified on Etherscan or BscScan might hide functions that allow minting, blocking wallets or draining liquidity. Always check the contract or look for an audit.No liquidity lock or audit: If the devs control all the liquidity provider tokens and there’s no lock or time-locked contract, they can pull the rug at any moment. Similarly, no third-party audit? That’s a gamble.Big token unlocks coming up: Large unlocks for insiders or early investors can trigger huge sell-offs. If you’re holding during a major vesting event, you could be exit liquidity. Know the schedule.Top tip: Before you click buy, ask, Who stands to gain the most if this pumps? Who gets hurt if it dumps? If the answer points to a few insiders with heavy bags and zero accountability, walk away.How to spot crypto trends before the crowdThe best early investors are the mechanics looking under the hood. They study token structures and unlock schedules, join communities early to catch signals firsthand, and follow the builders to see who’s actually shipping. Most importantly, they cross-check everything: on-chain data, social sentiment, developer activity, and liquidity. Tools like Dune, DefiLlama, Nansen and GitHub help them separate noise from substance — and spot winners before the crowd does.Crypto rewards those who are curious, critical and a little bit contrarian. The crowd usually shows up late. If you want to find gems before they moon, you’ll need to think independently, dig deeper, and act before the narrative forms.It’s not easy. But it’s doable. And the more you practice spotting early signals — the real ones, not the noise — the more second nature it becomes.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The proposed amendment would come after 18 Democrats sided with Republicans in the Senate in voting to advance the bill on May 20 after it failed a procedural vote on May 8.“Passing the GENIUS Act without our anti-corruption amendment stamps a Congressional seal of approval on Trump selling access and influence to the highest bidder,” Merkley said in a May 22 X post.Trump his three sons are involved in the crypto platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI), which launched its USD1 stablecoin in March.

Far from being bearish, the current level leaves room for bullish positioning on XRP futures markets.Related: Which senators invest in crypto? 11 lawmakers have blockchain-related investmentsFavorable regulation opens the door for new partnerships and acquisitionsPart of the limited XRP price upside can be explained by the multiple rejections of US Senator Cynthia Lummis, Chair of the US Congress Digital Assets Subcommittee, to meet Ripple representatives. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse asked on May 19 that the lawmaker “reconsider and be a leader for ALL of crypto,” and discuss “how to make the US the crypto capital of the world.”There is nothing stopping XRP from hitting $3.50 or even higher, as Ripple Labs is no longer facing direct threats from regulators, which paves the way for partnerships and acquisitions.

With Bitcoin (BTC) hitting an all-time high, market speculators are banking on eventual capital rotation, which could pump major altcoins like SOL toward new highs.Solana shows promising signs on the daily chart, forming a textbook bull flag pattern after a strong uptrend. While SOL prices currently trade under $180, a breakout above this level could propel SOL toward its first target at $200, with further upside potential to $220 if momentum sustains.Solana 1-day chart.

However, SOL needs a clear market structure break (MSB) or a decisive bullish breakout above $180 to trigger the next leg of the rally. Declining volumes during the consolidation phase suggest caution, as a lack of buying pressure could stall the breakout. If SOL fails to breach $180, the immediate key area of interest is between $140-150, and the bull flag pattern would be invalidated.

The funding rate was six times higher in Q1 and three times higher in Q4 last year.These low rates indicate minimal speculative activity in the futures market, with the rally driven by spot buyers rather than leveraged traders, reducing the risk of over-leveraged corrections. Such a scenario also indicates that Bitcoin might not have reached a state of euphoria yet. The availability of untapped liquidity in the crypto ecosystem underscores the potential for further growth.

2025-05-22T15:00:00.000Z,"Semiconductor exemptions don’t matter when it comes to tariffs","Opinion by: Ahmad Shadid of O.xyzSemiconductors scored a rare exemption from US President Donald Trump’s aggressive reciprocal tariffs, but the relief is symbolic at best. Most semiconductors enter the US embedded in servers, GPUs, laptops, and smartphones. The finished goods remain heavily tariffed, some with duties reaching up to 49%. The exemption looks good politically but delivers little practical benefit. Nvidia’s DGX systems, crucial for training advanced AI models, do not fall under the exempted HTS codes. Nvidia could pay effective tariffs nearing 40% on these vital components. Such costs threaten to stall critical AI infrastructure projects across the country. Semiconductor tariffs may compromise the goal of the CHIPS Act. The act promised tens of billions of dollars in subsidies to support domestic chip manufacturing. Yet advanced lithography machines — key equipment from countries like the Netherlands and Japan — face 20%–24% tariffs. Ironically, tariffs designed to boost American production increase the cost of essential manufacturing equipment.The effect of new tariffs is already slowing progress in critical supply chains — just as generative AI and large language models are gaining momentum across sectors like finance and defense. Any delays or cost increases now could blunt America’s technological advantage.Indirect costs undermine exemptions for AIModern semiconductor supply chains are global and highly integrated. An exemption on raw silicon means nothing when servers, GPUs and other finished products face steep tariffs. Tariffs indirectly inflate costs, eliminating any competitive advantage from domestic manufacturing.Indirect tariff costs hit high-end systems disproportionately hard. The effect ripples through AI model training, data center expansions and major infrastructure projects, significantly slowing the industry’s momentum.Tariff impasse halts investmentSo far, it’s clear that the US president’s tariff plan didn’t follow any conventional economic trends or calculated strategy. The uncertain tariff situation stalls investment decisions across the technology sector. Companies need predictable costs to justify large capital expenditures. Ongoing tariff volatility prevents them from committing resources to new data centers and manufacturing lines.This mirrors the supply chain chaos of 2020. At that time, uncertainty caused massive order cancellations and slowed industry recovery for years. If tariff ambiguity continues, we could see similar waves of cancellations in 2025. This would further compound existing inventory and revenue issues in the semiconductor sector.Domestic production is not optimalThe border argument for these tariffs is that they’re meant to boost domestic production. They do little, however, to encourage genuine domestic semiconductor production. Despite subsidies under the CHIPS Act, most US semiconductor companies still rely on international foundries for manufacturing. Instead, they face increased equipment and operational costs.Recent: How trade wars impact stocks and cryptoThe idea that tariffs promote domestic production ignores the reality of global semiconductor manufacturing. Costs rise across the board, putting American companies at a disadvantage rather than offering protection.AI projects face heightened riskThe blockchain and crypto sectors, particularly AI-driven projects, also feel the pinch. Projects depend heavily on GPUs and high-performance servers for mining, validating transactions and running decentralized AI computations. Increased hardware costs directly affect profitability and growth, potentially stalling innovation in blockchain applications. AI developments have just started to pick up the pace in the blockchain and Web3 space. The industry saw increased interest from investors and VCs just a year ago. So, they are still on tighter budgets. Elevated costs can, however, lead to stagnation. We might see innovators and developers exiting the market. The ripple effect extends beyond the general technology sector and could threaten future digital economies. Moreover, these cost pressures disproportionately affect startups and smaller tech firms. Industry giants can absorb additional expenses, but innovative, smaller players face existential threats. This dynamic risks stifling innovation at the grassroots level, harming the entire tech ecosystem.What to expect Semiconductors have momentarily escaped direct tariffs, but the exemption provides little benefit. Tariffs continue to hit finished products, driving up indirect costs across the industry. Instead of boosting domestic manufacturing, these tariffs create economic paralysis, stall critical infrastructure projects, and threaten America’s lead in AI innovation. Policymakers must acknowledge these realities and adjust their approach before irreversible damage is done to the nation’s technological future.Opinion by: Ahmad Shadid of O.xyz.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The system, the protocol, incentivizes them to actually run the system,” Nisan explained. “Basically, it can give them tokens for operating the system.”Staking offers what Nisan describes as two distinct types of security: computer science-based guarantees and economic disincentives for bad actors. “If a majority or supermajority, maybe two-thirds of the parties of the token of the staked amount are behaving properly... we can prove that the system acts correctly,” he said. “But you also have what I would call an economic guarantee... if they destroy the system, very likely the value of the token... will go down. So they are the one losing.”PoW vs PoSJenkinson, a vocal Bitcoin (BTC) supporter, posed the classic comparison: proof-of-work vs proof-of-stake. “Do you have any strong feelings about one or the other?” he asked.“The truth is that it’s not clear.. it's really a social question, I think.”Nisan noted that both mechanisms involve trade-offs around cost, control, and decentralization. The episode also explores the role of staking in tokenomics and system design. Nisan unpacks how fee mechanics and inflation controls, such as Ethereum’s minting curve, help keep the ecosystem in balance.To hear the full conversation on The Clear Crypto Podcast,  listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

2025-05-22T13:19:19.000Z,"These 4 memecoins can outperform Bitcoin this cycle","Key takeaways:Memecoins like Fartcoin, WIF, SPX6900, and Popcat are outperforming Bitcoin in the short term amid renewed crypto market euphoria.Bullish technical patterns signal more upside for top-performing memecoins.Popcat stands out with a potential 350% rally, while Fartcoin and WIF also eye significant gains in the coming weeks.Bitcoin (BTC) has surged 7.35% over the past three days, hitting a new all-time high near $112,000 on May 22, but memecoins are stealing the spotlight. Fueled by BTC’s rally, several high-risk tokens are posting even larger gains, stoking possibilities that they could continue to outperform Bitcoin as the crypto bull run accelerates.Fartcoin ascending channel hints at more gainsSolana-based Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) memecoin has surged 30% in the last three days to hit $1.57 as of May 22, its highest level in the last four months.The rally extends Fartcoin’s strong year-to-date (YTD) performance—up 74.50%—amid the ongoing memecoin frenzy. In comparison, Bitcoin has risen 18% so far in 2025.Technically, Fartcoin is trading within a well-defined ascending channel that began forming in early March, suggesting sustained bullish momentum.FARTCOIN/USDT daily price chart. Source: TradingViewThe memecoin has also broken above its 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA; the red wave), currently near $1.06, a key support level in uptrends.FARTCOIN’s relative strength index (RSI) was hovering near 64 as of May 22, suggesting there is room to run before selling conditions emerge near the overbought threshold at 70. If the uptrend holds, Fartcoin could retest the channel’s upper boundary near $2.74 by June, up 80% from the current price levels.Dogwifhat price could doubleLike FARTCOIN, Dogwifhat (WIF) has outperformed Bitcoin during the recent rally, up over 27% in the past three days. But the Solana memecoin has underperformed the top cryptocurrency year-to-date, down about 38%.But a bull pennant formation may put Dogwifhat in a position to catch up in the coming weeks. As of May 22, WIF’s price was testing the pennant’s upper trendline for a breakout, with its technical target at around $2.50, up about 125% from the current price levels.  WIF/USDT daily price chart.

It is, therefore, underperforming Bitcoin on a YTD timeframe but, like WIF, shows the potential of outperforming BTC this cycle in percentage terms.At the core of this bullish outlook is SPX6900’s ongoing bullish reversal attempts. As of May 22, the memecoin had entered the breakout stage of its prevailing ascending triangle pattern, eyeing a rally toward $1.34 by June.SPX6900/USDT daily price chart.

2025-05-22T12:38:44.000Z,"UK court partially dismisses Bitcoin SV investor’s lawsuit against Binance","The United Kingdom’s Court of Appeal has partially dismissed a lawsuit brought by Bitcoin SV investors against major crypto exchanges, including Binance, for allegedly conspiring to delist the token in 2019.In a judgment handed down on May 21, the court ruled that investors who held BSV through the delisting period (classified as “sub-class B”) were not entitled to billions in speculative damages based on BSV’s hypothetical growth.These investors had claimed over 8.9 billion British pounds ($11.9 billion) in damages, asserting that Binance’s delisting deprived holders of the chance to profit from BSV’s potential rise to a “top-tier cryptocurrency” like Bitcoin (BTC) or Bitcoin Cash (BCH).The court rejected this “foregone growth effect” theory, stating, “BSV was obviously not a unique cryptocurrency without reasonably similar substitutes,” pointing to the representative’s own use of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash as comparators.Sub-class B’s central claim was that delisting led to a missed opportunity to benefit from price appreciation. However, the court determined that those investors had ample chance to mitigate losses by selling or reinvesting in other crypto assets.“They had a duty to mitigate their losses,” wrote Master of the Rolls Sir Geoffrey Vos. “They cannot recover losses that they could reasonably have mitigated.”UK court ruling against Bitcoin SV investor’s lawsuit. Source: CaselawRelated: Bitcoin SV investors attempt to resurrect 2019 Binance lawsuitCourt strikes down “loss of a chance” argumentThe appeal also challenged the Tribunal’s application of the “market mitigation rule,” arguing that such issues should be left for trial.The court dismissed that notion, stating the rule clearly applies to freely tradable assets like BSV, and that the damages must be measured shortly after the delisting.An additional argument concerning the “loss of a chance” to benefit from future price gains was also struck down. The court ruled it “flawed as a matter of principle,” noting that “cryptocurrencies are, by their nature, volatile investments.”Binance’s limited strike-out application ultimately succeeded, with the court stating that even if some holders were unaware of the delisting, “they could never claim more than the total value of their holding before the delisting events plus any quantifiable consequential losses.”Related: Binance wants arbitration for all members of securities class suitBinance seeks to dismiss FTX lawsuitOn May 16, Binance filed a motion to dismiss a $1.76 billion lawsuit filed by the FTX estate, arguing that the claims are legally flawed and an attempt to shift responsibility for FTX’s collapse.The exchange stated the downfall of FTX stemmed from internal fraud, not external manipulation, citing Sam Bankman-Fried’s conviction on multiple fraud charges.Binance has asked the court to dismiss all claims with prejudice.

2025-05-22T10:21:18.000Z,"Can ChatGPT-powered AI agents really trade crypto for you?","Key takeawaysChatGPT-powered AI agents automate trading tasks using natural language prompts and API integrations, improving speed and consistency.Successes occur when ChatGPT is used as a support tool, not a fully autonomous trading system.Failures happen when traders over-rely on ChatGPT without real-time data, proper risk management or manual oversight.Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance.What if a crypto trader didn’t need to constantly check charts, worry about emotions, or stay up all night watching for sudden price swings? What if those tasks could be handled by an intelligent agent that understands instructions in plain English — and reacts within milliseconds? That’s where ChatGPT-powered AI agents come in.These tools combine natural language processing with real-time trading logic to automate decision-making in one of the world’s most volatile markets. From rebalancing portfolios to reacting to market sentiment, ChatGPT is being adapted to act as a trading assistant, risk manager and market analyst — all rolled into one. But can it truly match or even outperform human intuition? This article explores how far these agents have come, where they shine and where they still fall short.How ChatGPT-powered AI agents operate in cryptocurrency marketsChatGPT-powered AI agents are changing how people interact with crypto markets. These tools combine ChatGPT’s language abilities with external trading tools and APIs to help users monitor prices, understand trends and even place trades automatically. Instead of just reacting to charts or numbers, ChatGPT can understand plain language commands like “Buy Ethereum if the price drops below $2,000” or “Sell Bitcoin if RSI goes above 70.”These AI trading assistants can work with major platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, OKX and other centralized or decentralized exchanges and can also tap into decentralized finance (DeFi) tools and smart contracts. With the right setup, ChatGPT can help automate trading strategies based on both technical data and market news.Success stories vs. failures in ChatGPT-powered crypto tradingSome traders have used ChatGPT to assist in automating parts of their crypto trading processes, particularly for strategy generation and sentiment analysis. For example, a user shared on Reddit that they used a ChatGPT-based AI agent for technical analysis on Ether (ETH), feeding it four-hour and daily chart screenshots. By interpreting market sentiment, support and resistance zones, and other indicators, they managed to make $6,500 in profits.Similarly, in the broader crypto sector, ChatGPT has been applied to support project development activities such as drafting white papers and marketing content. A notable example is the launch of the “TURBO” memecoin, which reportedly reached a market capitalization of over $50 million in 2024. In this case, ChatGPT was used to streamline documentation and communication rather than manage trading activity, illustrating its usefulness as a support tool in crypto-related initiatives.However, limitations are evident when ChatGPT is applied beyond its core design. While ChatGPT could suggest a trading portfolio and explain its reasoning clearly, it lacks access to real-time market data and couldn’t respond to sudden volatility. In one instance, ChatGPT was allocated $100 across multiple tokens but failed to actively manage the portfolio as prices fluctuated. This resulted in missed opportunities and underperformance compared to dynamic algorithmic strategies.Individual experiences reinforce these observations. A Redditor exposed a scam where a YouTuber promoted a “ChatGPT trading bot” tutorial that led users to deploy malicious smart contracts. The contracts, generated using ChatGPT and passed off as safe, were designed to drain user wallets once funded. Victims collectively lost $17,240 in ETH, highlighting the danger of blindly trusting AI-generated code without proper auditing.Even when asked, “If I use ChatGPT to build an AI agent for crypto trading, can I become a millionaire?” ChatGPT responded with a realistic outlook — acknowledging that while it’s possible, success depends on having a profitable strategy, disciplined risk management, and the ability to scale effectively.Here is ChatGPT’s response:These cases suggest that while ChatGPT can support certain elements of the trading process, it should not be treated as a standalone solution for autonomous crypto trading.AI in crypto trading: Key benefits and limitationsAI tools like ChatGPT are increasingly being integrated into crypto trading workflows to improve speed, accuracy and efficiency. While they offer important advantages, they also carry specific limitations that traders must actively manage. Below are the main benefits and challenges:Key benefits of using AI for crypto tradingAI bots can execute trades in milliseconds, crucial for capturing opportunities in fast-moving crypto markets.Bots follow pre-programmed rules precisely, eliminating emotional biases that often affect human traders.Crypto markets are always open, and AI bots can monitor and act around the clock without interruption.A single bot can manage multiple trading pairs, exchanges and strategies simultaneously.ChatGPT can understand specific prompts like “Rebalance every Monday” or “Set stop-loss at 5%,” allowing flexible automation.Limitations of ChatGPT in cryptocurrency tradingChatGPT does not access live market data unless specifically integrated with external APIs (e.g., TradingView, CoinMarketCap or exchange websockets).Instructions must be clear and unambiguous; ChatGPT may misinterpret vague or complex commands.Improperly secured API keys or lack of two-factor authentication (2FA) can expose trading accounts to unauthorized access.ChatGPT’s cloud-based infrastructure can introduce latency, which could impact performance during highly volatile periods.ChatGPT does not monitor regional compliance rules; users must manually enforce trading limits based on local regulations.Ethical and regulatory implications of AI in crypto tradingAs AI becomes more integrated into trading systems, it raises significant ethical and regulatory concerns that stakeholders across the financial sector are beginning to address.Accountability: If an AI agent executes a harmful or unlawful trade, questions arise around legal responsibility. It remains unclear in many jurisdictions whether liability falls primarily on the developer, the trader using the AI system or the platform facilitating the transactions.Market manipulation risks: Autonomous AI bots could unintentionally engage in activities such as spoofing (placing and canceling fake orders to mislead the market) or wash trading (creating artificial volume), especially if not properly programmed with compliance safeguards.Regulatory oversight: Financial authorities, including the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the European Securities and Markets Authority, are actively studying the implications of AI and algorithmic trading. These agencies have recognized that traditional trading regulations may not fully account for autonomous decision-making by AI systems.Policy developments: In January 2024, the European Commission released updates to its Digital Finance Strategy, which included references to AI-based financial services. While not yet finalized, these draft regulations under the broader Digital Finance Package signal a move toward stricter compliance expectations for firms deploying AI in financial markets.Meanwhile, ethical crypto platforms are beginning to voluntarily disclose the use of trading bots in their systems. In parallel, open-source communities are advocating for clearer audit trails, improved model transparency and the establishment of ethical guidelines for AI applications in finance to ensure accountability and fairness.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-22T10:02:14.000Z,"Crypto travelers bring 3x greater lifetime value than fiat users","Travelers using cryptocurrency for booking arrangements spend more than twice as much as regular travelers using fiat money, according to a joint report from Binance Pay and crypto travel platform Travala shared with Cointelegraph.Crypto-based bookings on Travala reached $80 million in 2024, up from $45 million the year before. Crypto travelers are also outspending their fiat counterparts, with an average booking value of  $1,211 per transaction, over 2.5 times more than fiat users who spend $469.Additionally, the report said crypto users were three times more valuable over their lifetime due to longer stays and higher repeat bookings, with crypto travelers 57% more likely to make a repeat hotel purchase.Source: Binance Pay, TravalaJuan Otero, CEO of Travala, attributed these travel preferences to the flexible nature of Web3 jobs:“Many also work in the digital asset industry or have flexible, remote work lifestyles, which makes them more likely to travel frequently and stay in one place for longer while seeking out destinations that support seamless, global payments.”Crypto-based transactions have become more common in the travel sector and beyond. Airlines that have integrated digital currencies into their booking systems have seen a 40% boost in bookings, with travel and hospitality representing 14% of all crypto transactions in 2024, according to a Feb. 21 report by Triple-A.Related: Crypto spending will grow, but fiat isn’t going anywhere: Mercuryo CEOThe main benefit of using crypto for travel is its borderless, global utility, Jonathan Lim, the global head of Binance Pay, told Cointelegraph. “Travelers can skip currency exchange lines, avoid foreign transaction fees, and pay instantly using assets they already hold,” he added.A growing number of crypto users also drives the increase in travelers using crypto to pay for trips. Triple-A’s report shows that cryptocurrency ownership has a compound annual growth rate of 99%, significantly outpacing the growth of traditional payment methods. Among crypto owners, 65% express interest in using it for payments.Founded in 2017, Travala is among the most popular crypto-native travel platforms, which enables users to pay for services like flights, hotel stays and tours with 141 different cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC) and USDC (USDC) via Binance Pay. Related: Bhutan launches tourism crypto payments with Binance Pay and DK BankCrypto payment covers more and more retail industriesThe first real-world Bitcoin transaction — 10,000 BTC for two pizzas — occurred 15 years ago today, on May 22, 2010, now commemorated as Bitcoin Pizza Day.

2025-05-22T08:37:57.000Z,"Dubai regulator clarifies real-world asset tokenization rules: Lawyer","Newly updated guidelines from Dubai’s crypto regulator include provisions on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and clarify rules for issuers. On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) released its updated Rulebook for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) operating in the region. The regulator gave market participants until June 19 to comply with the new rules. The regulator previously told Cointelegraph that it had enhanced supervisory mechanisms and brought consistency across activity-based rules. One of the more prominent changes includes regulatory clarity on RWA tokens. Irina Heaver, partner at the United Arab Emirates-based law firm NeosLegal, told Cointelegraph that the updated rules clarify RWA issuance and distribution. “Issuing real-world asset tokens and listing them on secondary markets is no longer theoretical,” Heaver told Cointelegraph. “It’s now a regulatory reality in Dubai and the broader UAE.”A “viable” path to realize RWA hypeHeaver compared RWAs to security token offerings (STOs), an earlier attempt from the crypto space to tokenize securities like stocks, bonds and real estate investment trusts. However, the UAE crypto lawyer said that STOs “died a peaceful death in 2018 to 2019.” The lawyer told Cointelegraph STOs did not work out because of the lack of regulatory clarity, viable secondary market trading venues, institutional investor appetite and liquidity. Still, the situation is different for RWAs. Heaver told Cointelegraph that RWAs are the next foundational layer for institutional adoption of blockchain and virtual assets. Heaver said that VARA’s new rules already cover them as Asset-Referenced Virtual Assets (ARVA) tokens. She said: “VARA’s newly updated Virtual Asset Issuance Rulebook (May 2025) addresses these failures head-on. Regulated exchanges and broker-dealers in Dubai are now authorized to distribute and list ARVA tokens.”The lawyer said this solves an issue in jurisdictions like Switzerland, where token issuance is possible, but listing and secondary trading remain unregulated. Related: Dubai gov’t agencies to link real estate registry with property tokenizationLawyer shares requirements for RWA issuersHeaver said ARVA tokens are defined under Dubai law as representing direct or indirect ownership of real-world assets, granting entitlement to receive or share income and purporting to maintain a stable value by reference to real-world assets or income. ARVA tokens are also backed or collateralised by such real-world assets or constitute a derivative, wrapped, duplicated, or fractionalised version of another ARVA. The lawyer said issuers must meet specific requirements, including a Category 1 Virtual Asset Issuance license, a comprehensive white paper and a risk disclosure statement. In addition, issuers must have a paid-up capital of 1.5 million UAE dirhams (about $408,000) or 2% of reserve assets held. The issuers are also subjected to monthly independent audit obligations and must adhere to ongoing supervisory oversight. “VARA is providing regulatory clarity, and it’s giving the industry a viable, enforceable path to turn the hype of RWA tokenization into reality,” Heaver told Cointelegraph. “This matters because it marks a shift, from theory to execution, from fiction to framework.”Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/dubai-vara-guidelines-rwa-tokenization-clarity?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-22T08:25:00.000Z,"5 red flags you’re being shilled: Don’t buy the hype","What is shilling in crypto?              At its core, shilling is the act of artificially promoting a cryptocurrency or token, often with exaggerated claims, to increase its price or popularity. But what’s the goal? Hype it up, get others to buy in, and then cash out, leaving latecomers holding the bag.Shilling can come from anyone: influencers, anonymous accounts or even high-profile figures with political or financial clout. The common thread is manipulation: It’s not about educating you or building real value but pumping hype for personal gain.Unfortunately, the line between enthusiastic promotion and outright deception can be thin, and many fall victim without realizing it. That’s why it’s critical to learn how to spot the signs early.                  5 red flags you’re being shilled              Beware of crypto red flags like overhyped promises, anonymous teams, influencer shills, missing products and FOMO tactics — if it smells like a scam, it probably is.1. Overhyped promises You’ve probably seen posts that scream:“100x potential!”“Guaranteed returns!”“This is your ticket to financial freedom!”These are classic shill tactics. Real, credible projects don’t promise life-changing profits. Why? Because there are no guarantees in crypto or in any investment.When a project leads with grandiose financial claims rather than actual product value or utility, it’s likely a ploy to stir FOMO and attract unsuspecting investors. The truth is, if something sounds too good to be true, it almost always is.Remember: The bigger the promise, the bigger the red flag.2. Anonymous or suspicious teams In crypto, anonymity isn’t always bad, but when you’re trusting people with your money, transparency matters.It’s a major red flag when a project has:No identifiable team membersFake names or aliasesStock photos on its websiteNo LinkedIn or professional history.The simple rule is “No face, no funds.”Scammers often hide behind anonymity because they know they’ll eventually vanish and there’ll be no one to hold accountable. Even worse, some use fabricated credentials or hire actors to pose as team members.Before investing, check whether the founders or developers have any verifiable history. Do they have prior experience in blockchain or startups? Have they launched anything successful before?3. Influencer spam and paid promotions One day, no one’s talking about a particular coin — the next, your feed is flooded with influencers hyping it up. Sound familiar?This sudden burst of attention is often coordinated with a paid promotion campaign disguised as “genuine enthusiasm.”Many influencers fail to disclose sponsorships, even though it’s required by law in many countries. The US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have cracked down on this in recent years.Take, for example:Kim Kardashian, who was fined $1.26 million in 2022 for promoting EthereumMax without proper disclosure.Floyd Mayweather Jr., who was sued for endorsing the same project at a paid event.BitBoy (Ben Armstrong), who faced legal action in multiple lawsuits for promoting scam tokens to his audience.If you notice multiple influencers promoting the same project in a short time, especially without using labels like #ad or #sponsored, it’s a strong indicator of a shill campaign.Don’t mistake volume for value. Hype doesn’t equal legitimacy.4. No real product or roadmapIf you visit the project’s website, it looks sleek, maybe even impressive. But where’s the product? Where’s the code?Shilled tokens often rely on flashy marketing but have no working application, no GitHub code and no actual use case. Everything is either “coming soon” or buried behind vague promises.Ask yourself:Can I use the platform or app today?Is there a white paper that makes sense?Do they have public repositories or open development?If all you’re seeing is a landing page and a vague roadmap that’s been “coming soon” for months, that’s a major red flag.5. Pressure tactics and FOMO Time pressure is a psychological weapon, and shillers know how to use it.Watch out for lines such as:“Presale ends in 2 hours!”“Only 1,000 spots left!”“If you don’t buy now, you’ll miss out forever!”These tactics prey on your fear of missing out (FOMO) and push you into making impulsive decisions without research.But crypto isn’t a sprint; it’s a long-term game. Anyone trying to rush you into buying likely has something to hide. Solid investments don’t need fake urgency.Take a breath, step back, and ask yourself: Am I buying because I believe in this project or because I’m being manipulated?Did you know? The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) secured a $128-million judgment against Ryan Mitchell Pope, Daniel Samuel Bishop and their company EmpiresX for operating a fraudulent forex and cryptocurrency investment scheme that defrauded over 12,500 victims.                  Is shilling illegal in crypto? Can influencers be sued?              Shilling isn’t just unethical in many cases — it’s also illegal.In the world of crypto, undisclosed promotions are a major legal risk. If someone is paid to promote a token or project but fails to reveal that financial connection, they could face fines, lawsuits or even criminal charges. This is especially true if the promoted token is later classified as a security under US law.Regulators like the SEC, FTC and CFTC have all cracked down on this behavior. Their targets have included:Influencers who failed to disclose paid promotionsPromoters who misled investors with false claimsIndividuals who ran pump-and-dump schemes using social media.Francier Obando Pinillo, a pastor from Miami, was indicted on 26 fraud counts for running a crypto scam through “Solano Fi,” defrauding investors of millions from 2021 to 2023. He allegedly used his church, social media and false promises of 34.9% monthly returns to lure victims. The platform showed fake gains but blocked withdrawals, while funds were diverted for personal use. Pinillo was arraigned in Richland, Washington and faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.As crypto becomes more mainstream, expect stricter regulations and more consequences for shillers.Did you know? Argentine President Javier Milei has dissolved the special task force investigating the LIBRA cryptocurrency scandal, a project he promoted in February 2025 that surged to a $4.5-billion valuation before crashing by over 97%. The task force, created by Milei himself, was disbanded via Decree 332/2025, citing that it had fulfilled its purpose. However, critics argue that no official findings were released, and judicial investigations into Milei and his associates continue.                  How to protect yourself from shilling scams              Do your own research, verify the team and utility, ignore hype and influencers, and stay alert to pump-and-dump schemes to avoid crypto shilling traps.Let’s understand how you can protect yourself from shilling scams in crypto:Do your own research (DYOR): Always research the project, the team behind it and the data supporting the claims. Don’t rely solely on hype or influencer recommendations. Look into onchain data, GitHub activity and the project’s utility to make informed decisions.Verify the team: A legitimate crypto project should have a transparent and credible team. If the developers are anonymous or have no professional profiles (like LinkedIn), that’s a red flag. Always check the team’s past projects and credibility before investing.Look for real utility: Does this project actually solve a problem? A genuine project should have a working product or solution, not just promises. Avoid projects that lack real-world utility or are still in “coming soon” stages for extended periods.Ignore the hype: If a token is suddenly trending on social media or being aggressively promoted, don’t let FOMO influence your judgment. Shillers often rely on emotions to push their agenda, so it’s essential to evaluate projects based on their merits, not just popularity.Stay skeptical of influencers: Influencers with large followings may be paid to promote certain tokens. Before taking their advice, ask yourself, What’s their incentive? Verify the promotion is legitimate and disclosed as paid or sponsored. Always cross-check the information with independent sources.Watch for pump-and-dump schemes: Be cautious of sudden price spikes followed by rapid drops. These are often signs of pump-and-dump schemes where the token’s value is artificially inflated by coordinated buying and then quickly sold off, leaving investors with losses. Always monitor price trends and be wary of sudden, unexplained increases in value.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/5-red-flags-youre-being-shilled-dont-buy-the-hype?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
