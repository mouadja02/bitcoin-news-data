The BTC price uptrend ‚Äúmay continue‚Äù as a result, CryptoQuant analysis concludes. Bitcoin short-term holders are firmly in the black in a further potential bull market boost. Bitcoin ( BTC ) buyers remain dominant on exchanges as all-time highs are met with unusual optimism. Data from onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant shows a 90-day cumulative volume delta (CVD) favoring Bitcoin bulls. CryptoQuant: BTC price uptrend ‚Äúmay continue‚Äù BTC price all-time highs continue to find support among traders, with buyers staying dominant despite the market surging 50% in under two months. Analyzing 90-day CVD, CryptoQuant contributor Ibrahim Cosar reveals the extent to which sellers have ceded control during that period. ‚ÄúIn short: Buy orders (taker buy) have become dominant again. In other words, more buy orders are being placed in the market than sell orders,‚Äù he summarizes. ‚ÄúThis generally signals that the uptrend may continue.‚Äù Bitcoin spot taker CVD. Source: CryptoQuant CVD measures the difference between buy and sell volume over a three-month period. Until mid-March, sell-side pressure dominated the order book, with BTC/USD hitting multimonth lows under $75,000 in early April. Neutral conditions then prevailed until buyer dominance reentered in May. ‚ÄúThe summary of the situation: As the price tests above $110K and reaches a new all-time high (ATH), buyers have not backed down. This could be setting the stage for another wave of upward movement,‚Äù Cosar concludes. Bitcoin hodlers hold off on sales As Cointelegraph reported , hodlers have broadly refrained from distributing coins to the market at current levels.

2025-05-23T08:36:20.000Z,"More Bitcoin Gains Over the Weekend? Renewed Buyer Momentum Says So","Bitcoin surged to a fresh record high above $111,000 earlier this week, marking a strong recovery from its early April low of $75,000. This rally reflects a renewed appetite for risk among investors, and analysts believe the cryptocurrency could climb even higher. Buyers Return in Force Upon examining the Spot Taker Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) over a 90-day window, CryptoQuant analysts have observed a return to the ‚Äúgreen‚Äù zone, indicating that taker buy orders are once again outpacing sell orders. This metric tracks the net difference between aggressive buyers and sellers in the spot market, and its recent turn upward signals renewed buying interest. For much of the past few months, the chart remained red, reflecting dominant selling pressure that coincided with price pullbacks. However, the current transition implies that buyers may be regaining control, which could support the case for continued price appreciation. As Bitcoin hovers near its new all-time high, the sustained strength in taker buy activity suggests market participants are not taking profits or stepping back. In fact, they appear to be stepping in. This renewed demand at historically high prices could pave the way for the next leg of the rally, which could potentially attract even more capital into the market. Topside Interest Rebuilds A similar sentiment was echoed by QCP Capital in its latest market update , which revealed that Bitcoin‚Äôs brief pullback post-ATH saw some investors locking in gains through puts, but demand on the upside quickly resumed. A key sign of this was the aggressive buying of 1,000 call contracts for September at the 130K strike, which is a cost-effective and strategic way to play a breakout. With a regulatory climate in the US becoming more favorable and institutional demand continuing through ETFs and spot exposure, the structural case for Bitcoin remains strong, as per the trading firm. On top of that, Strategy‚Äôs $2.1 billion sale of 10% Perpetual Preferred Stock to fund additional BTC acquisitions is expected to serve as a catalyst for further gains.

2025-05-23T08:35:43.000Z,"Trump Gifts Tron Founder Justin Sun Golden Watch for Being Top $TRUMP Holder","Key Takeaways: Justin Sun received a Trump Golden Tourbillon watch for being the top $TRUMP memecoin holder. Attendees spent a combined $148 million to qualify for Trump‚Äôs exclusive crypto dinner. The event drew political backlash and protests over Trump‚Äôs growing ties to crypto. Tron founder Justin Sun has received a Trump-branded Golden Tourbillon watch for being the top holder of President Donald Trump‚Äôs memecoin. In a May 23 post on X , Sun revealed he was awarded a luxury Trump Golden Tourbillon watch during the exclusive dinner hosted by Donald Trump. The event, held at Trump‚Äôs private golf club in Virginia, gathered the top 220 $TRUMP memecoin holders. Sun, a known crypto billionaire and backer of Trump-linked projects, claimed the top spot among them. ‚ÄúPresident Trump said to me, ‚ÄòEveryone in this room got in so early. Our young team is destined to achieve great things,‚Äô‚Äù Sun wrote in a follow-up post, alongside images of the award ceremony. I was awarded a Trump Golden Tourbillon watch by Trump! pic.twitter.com/CCYGQ6FMPA ‚Äî H.E. Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) May 23, 2025 Sun Leads as top Memecoin Buyers to Attend Trump Event The private dinner required an estimated $148 million in collective token purchases between April 23 and May 12 to qualify for entry, according to data from Inca Digital. The top 25 spenders, who contributed over $111 million, were granted access to a VIP reception and a private tour with the former president. The $TRUMP token‚Äôs website, managed by Fight Fight Fight LLC ‚Äî an affiliate of the Trump Organization ‚Äî listed the event perks. Alongside CIC Digital LLC, the Trump family controls 80% of the token supply, per on-chain data. Chainalysis reports that over $320 million in trading fees have flowed to wallets tied to the token‚Äôs creators since January. Former NBA star Lamar Odom was also among the top 220 buyers of the $TRUMP memecoin and qualified to attend the dinner. Ogle, a crypto investor known by this pseudonym, was also among the top 220 buyers who qualified for the event. Notably, Trump‚Äôs crypto ventures go beyond the memecoin. He and First Lady Melania Trump each have official tokens, while Trump Media‚Äôs financial arm, Truth.Fi, offers crypto ETFs. Eric Trump, meanwhile, co-founded a Bitcoin mining firm that‚Äôs preparing for a public listing. Justin Sun‚Äôs ties to the Trump crypto orbit are extensive. The Tron founder is also the biggest backer of World Liberty Financial (WLF), a crypto venture led by Zach Witkoff, son of Trump‚Äôs Middle East envoy. Sun invested $75 million in the firm and purchased $30 million worth of its tokens during the launch. Political Blowback and Legal Clouds The event drew criticism from lawmakers . Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) called Trump‚Äôs crypto ventures a ‚Äúpersonal money-making machine,‚Äù while Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) admitted the optics ‚Äúgive me pause.‚Äù A group of Democrats is holding a press conference to address potential conflicts of interest. Furthermore, roughly 100 demonstrators gathered outside the Trump National Golf Club in Virginia as guests arrived. Protesters held signs reading ‚ÄúAmerica is not for sale‚Äù and ‚ÄúStop Crypto Corruption‚Äù while chanting ‚ÄúShame!‚Äù as attendees emerged from their cars near the club‚Äôs security checkpoint. Some shouted, ‚ÄúI hope you choke on your dinner,‚Äù while others carried props, including a gold coin with Trump‚Äôs face and placards demanding the guest list be made public.

2025-05-23T08:30:25.000Z,"Can Dogecoin Really Hit $3.80? Analyst Says Yes‚ÄîIf This Happens","Dogecoin‚Äôs latest market structure is ‚Äúsignificantly better than in prior bull markets,‚Äù according to Kevin, the crypto technician known on X and YouTube as @Kev_Capital_TA. In a video released Friday, the analyst mapped Dogecoin‚Äôs three historical cycles, concluding that the memecoin‚Äôs current breakout-and-retest pattern places a long-term Fibonacci extension at $3.80‚Äì$3.90 squarely ‚Äúon the table‚Äù‚Äîprovided one key condition holds: Bitcoin must keep grinding higher. ‚ÄúTwo cycles in a row, Dogecoin has tagged the 1.618 fib extension,‚Äù Kevin reminded viewers. ‚ÄúHere we are in the third cycle‚Ä¶ we have evidence to suggest it has happened 100% of the time. It‚Äôs only two data points, though, so that could easily not happen this time.‚Äù Why $3.80 Per Dogecoin Is Possible This Cycle On a log-scale weekly chart, Kevin traced Dogecoin‚Äôs first super-cycle‚Äîconsolidation, breakout, mid-cycle pullback, blow-off top‚Äîculminating at the 1.618 extension. The second cycle repeated the pattern, but ‚ÄúElon Musk‚Äôs Saturday Night Live hype‚Äù punched price far beyond the fib target into euphoric territory. Today‚Äôs third cycle, he argued, looks healthier: successive breakouts and back-tests of the bear-market range have carved a rising channel of higher highs and higher lows anchored by the 200-week EMA/SMA cluster. ‚ÄúThis structure looks really good to me‚Ä¶ break out, back-test the 200s, make a higher low‚Äîit‚Äôs textbook.‚Äù On the monthly chart, the Relative Strength Index is ‚Äújust strength‚Äîconstant higher lows,‚Äù still far beneath the 80-to-90 zone that capped prior cycle tops. Kevin also flagged a V-shaped curl in the monthly Stoch RSI‚Äîa signal that ‚Äúshould provide the momentum we need to really get a durable run higher‚Äù once it crosses the 20 line. Related Reading: Dogecoin To $1 Is ‚ÄòAbsolutely‚Äô On The Table This Cycle, Says Analyst The two-week Market Cipher readout shows three years of progressively stronger momentum waves and money-flow inflows. ‚ÄúThis is big-time stuff,‚Äù he said, circling each expansion. ‚ÄúMomentum is compressing and building to a point where it‚Äôs like, okay, now it‚Äôs time to release it.‚Äù A fresh two-week Stoch RSI cross historically precedes ‚Äúbang, big move higher,‚Äù he added, implying that the post-halving phase could usher in Dogecoin‚Äôs next parabolic leg. For traders fixated on nearer horizons, Kevin highlighted a macro golden pocket stretching from $0.26 to $0.285, reinforced by the daily 200-SMA at $0.27. That zone caps a developing bull-flag whose measured move targets $0.32‚Äì0.33. The pattern sprang out of an inverse head-and-shoulders accumulation at $0.15, a level he ‚Äúaccumulated heavily,‚Äù now up roughly 60%. ‚ÄúTreat resistance as resistance until it isn‚Äôt,‚Äù he cautioned, noting that Bitcoin dominance near 64% still siphons liquidity from altcoins. Yet he sees ‚Äúserious signs‚Äù that dominance has printed a local top at 65.45%, opening room for a rotation into majors like Ethereum and, by proxy, Dogecoin. This Needs To Happen If Bitcoin stability endures and macro conditions‚Äîsoftening inflation, steady labor data, potential Fed easing‚Äîremain supportive, Kevin‚Äôs next ‚Äúmain price target‚Äù is the 2021 all-time high just under $1.00. A decisive break there would turn eyes to the cycle‚Äôs 1.618 extension near $3.80. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bollinger Squeeze Signals ‚ÄòHuge Move‚Äô Ahead, Analyst Warns ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be shocked at this point if we don‚Äôt go to that level,‚Äù he said, while stressing disciplined profit-taking: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing worse than riding a move all the way up and not taking profits.‚Äù Kevin rebuffed the wilder six-and-seven-dollar predictions circulating on social media but insisted that a $3-plus Dogecoin is ‚Äúabsolutely possible‚Äù if Bitcoin pushes toward $200,000, quantitative tightening ends, and a full-blown altcoin season erupts. Dogecoin remains ‚Äúone of the most popular cryptocurrencies on the planet,‚Äù the analyst observed. ‚ÄúWhen retail comes piling back in, they‚Äôre always piling back into Dogecoin.‚Äù That psychological feedback loop, combined with a structurally bullish chart and improving momentum gauges, underpins his conviction that the memecoin could reprise its role as the spearhead of a broader altcoin surge. Whether the market delivers the necessary macro tailwinds is the wildcard. But Kevin‚Äôs message was unambiguous: for now, Dogecoin‚Äôs technical canvas paints a credible route to $1, and the elusive $3.80 marker ‚Äúis possible‚Äîif Bitcoin holds ground and the macro stays peachy.‚Äù At press time, DOGE traded at $0.243.

2025-05-23T08:17:08.000Z,"Michigan lawmakers introduce new crypto bills covering state investments, mining, and CBDCs","Four new cryptocurrency-related bills were introduced in the Michigan legislature this week, covering public pension investments in crypto, mining, income tax exemptions, and restrictions on CBDC support. As of May 23, four new proposed legislations, House Bills 4510, 4511, 4512, and 4513, have been introduced in the Michigan legislature, marking a coordinated push to define the state‚Äôs approach to cryptocurrency. https://twitter.com/Bitcoin_Laws/status/1925295585718149632/?20 House Bill 4510, introduced by Representative Bill Schuette, seeks to amend Michigan‚Äôs Public Employee Retirement System Investment Act to allow the state treasurer to invest in cryptocurrencies. The bill restricts eligibility to digital assets with an average market capitalization of at least $250 billion over the past calendar year. Currently, only Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) meet this threshold. These investments must be made through exchange-traded products issued by a registered investment company. House Bill 4511 , sponsored by Representative Bryan Posthumus, proposes prohibiting the state and its subdivisions from banning the holding of digital assets or imposing licensing, permitting, or discriminatory tax requirements based solely on digital asset usage. It also bars state agencies from advocating for or supporting any federal CBDC by issuing memoranda or official endorsements. Additionally, the bill protects blockchain participants by preventing restrictions on node operations, asset transfers, and staking, while shielding validators and node operators from civil liability.

Meanwhile, House Bill 4512 , introduced by a bipartisan group led by Representative Mike McFall, outlines a Bitcoin mining partnership programme targeting abandoned oil and gas wells. Under the proposed programme, participants would receive temporary rights to use the wells for energy generation in return for assuming responsibility for plugging, site restoration, and response activity. The bill requires the supervisor of wells to identify eligible sites, publish detailed assessments, and manage a competitive bidding process. Selected participants must provide financial assurances, submit environmental and production data, and report annually. Mining rights are contingent on adherence to these obligations and capped plugging costs. McFall also led the introduction of House Bill 4513 , which would amend Michigan‚Äôs Income Tax Act to exempt income earned through the proposed Bitcoin mining programme from state income tax. The amendment defines the scope of exempt income and aligns it with the programme framework established under HB 4512, providing clarity for both individual and corporate taxpayers participating in the initiative. In addition to these four bills, Michigan is also considering the creation of a strategic cryptocurrency reserve. Introduced on Feb. 13 as House Bill 4087, this earlier proposal, backed by Representatives Posthumus and Ron Robinson, would authorize the state treasurer to allocate up to 10% of the general fund and Budget Stabilization Fund for crypto investments.

2025-05-23T08:11:16.000Z,"Michigan Lawmakers Propose Four Crypto Bills: Details","Michigan legislators have introduced a comprehensive package of four crypto-focused bills, signaling the state‚Äôs growing interest in embracing digital assets across various sectors, from public pensions to energy repurposing. The proposals, put forward on May 21 by both Republican and Democratic lawmakers, cover cryptocurrency investment guidelines, mining operations, central bank digital currency (CBDC) opposition, and taxation rules. Michigan State Retirement Funds May Soon Include Crypto House Bill 4510 , introduced by Republican Representative Bill Schuette, aims to revise Michigan Public Employee Retirement System Investment Act. If passed, the amendment would allow the state treasurer, currently Rachael Eubanks, to invest retirement funds into cryptocurrencies , provided the assets maintain an average market capitalization above $250 million over the preceding year. As of now, only Bitcoin and Ether meet that threshold. Importantly, the bill specifies that investments must be made through exchange-traded products (ETPs) issued by registered investment companies. This move aligns with previous efforts; a similar proposal in February suggested allowing up to 10% of Michigan‚Äôs Budget Stabilization Fund to be invested in cryptocurrencies. Lawmakers appear to be testing the waters while maintaining risk control through clearly defined criteria. Opposition to CBDCs and New Mining Opportunities House Bill 4511 , introduced by Republican Representative Bryan Posthumus, takes a more defensive stance. It proposes that Michigan prohibit any licensing requirements on crypto holders and blocks the state from supporting a federally issued central bank digital currency. The bill defines ‚Äúsupport‚Äù as any official endorsement or participation in federal CBDC trials, signaling strong skepticism toward government-controlled digital assets. Meanwhile, HB 4512 , backed by a bipartisan group led by Democrat Mike McFall, outlines the creation of a Bitcoin mining program specifically designed for abandoned oil and gas sites. The program would allow operators to establish mining facilities at these locations, subject to regulatory review. Interested applicants must submit documentation proving operational capability and outline their expected breakeven costs, ensuring the ventures are both legal and economically viable. The final bill in the package, HB 4513 , would ensure that income earned from the proposed mining operations is taxed under Michigan‚Äôs existing income tax framework. It provides clarity on how earnings from the initiative will be treated, closing potential loopholes before the program even launches.

In the gala event, Sun called Trump‚Äôs support for crypto ‚Äúone of his best decisions,‚Äù saying it could help the U.S. return to being a global crypto hub. Just a few years ago, Sun was navigating Biden-era crypto restrictions. Now, he sees Trump as a turning point for the industry. As the top holder of $TRUMP and proud supporter of President Trump, it was an honor to attend the Trump Gala Dinner by @GetTrumpMemes . Thank you @POTUS for your unwavering support of our industry! #MakeCryptoGreatAgain pic.twitter.com/Yy2TuWEgzT ‚Äî H.E. Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) May 23, 2025 No, It‚Äôs Not Bribery, Says Sun Some critics have accused the TRUMP memecoin of being a shady move, possibly even a bribe. Sun quickly shut that down, saying those claims are ‚Äúshort-sighted.‚Äù He believes Trump‚Äôs embrace of crypto is encouraging investors and innovators to stay in the U.S., reversing the trend of moving operations overseas. From Pushback to Progress Sun recalled how several U.S. crypto supporters, frustrated with strict regulations under Biden, were thinking about relocating to friendlier regions like Hong Kong or Singapore. But now, Sun says, Trump‚Äôs positive stance on crypto is changing minds and keeping talent in the U.S. Memecoins Deserve Respect While the dinner saw its share of protesters, Sun stood firm in support of memecoins. Critics, including media and even figures like Barstool‚Äôs Dave Portnoy, have called memecoins ‚ÄúPonzi schemes‚Äù or ‚Äúgambling.‚Äù Sun disagrees. He argues that coins like DOGE and SHIB have proven their value by bringing more users into the crypto space. According to him, meme coins are just another part of crypto‚Äôs entrepreneurial world; some will fail, but others will thrive. Sun sees the TRUMP token and memecoins in general as legitimate players in the crypto economy. ‚ÄúThey have merit,‚Äù he said. And with the U.S. warming back up to crypto, especially under Trump, Sun believes this could be the start of a new crypto boom. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Soars Past $111K as U.S. Traders Take the Lead ‚Äî But For How Long? , Crypto Reaction Mostly, the crypto reaction is negative as they see it as a possible scam and call it a ‚Äúcycle of corruption‚Äù. The watchdog group End Citizens United is calling out Tron founder Justin Sun, accusing him of using money to dodge legal trouble and gain political access. The group claimed that Sun was facing SEC charges before investing $75 million into Trump‚Äôs crypto company , and soon after, the case was dropped.

2025-05-23T07:46:55.000Z,"Bitcoin Enters Strongest Accumulation Phase Since January as BTC Price Passes $110K","Bitcoin BTC has entered a strong accumulation phase across all wallet cohorts for the first time since January, signaling renewed bullish sentiment as the largest cryptocurrency trades above $110,000, an 18% gain over the past month. Glassnode's Accumulation Trend Score has reached its maximum value of 1.0, indicating broad-based, aggressive accumulation by investors irrespective of the amount of BTC they already hold. The metric evaluates the relative strength of buying by different wallet sizes, factoring in both their existing holdings and the amount acquired over the past 15 days. It excludes exchanges and miners to avoid distortion. The latest accumulation wave began in early May, led by whales holding over 10,000 BTC. As the price began to climb, cohorts with smaller holdings followed, intensifying their accumulation behavior. This marks a significant shift from the January-to-April period, when most cohorts were in reducing their holdings as bitcoin tumbled from its then-record high of $109,000 to lows around $75,000. The renewed demand is supported by options market activity, with CoinDesk Research highlighting large bullish positions. The $300,000 strike for June expiry has become the most popular call option, with $620 million in notional value, and an additional $420 million is concentrated around the $200,000 strike. While bitcoin historically tends to fall after hitting an all-time high due to profit-taking, traditional assets like the S&P 500 and gold often extend their rallies in similar scenarios. If bitcoin were to follow this more mature asset behavior, it may signal the beginning of a sustained bull cycle, a trend many in the market are now watching closely.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/23/bitcoin-enters-strongest-accumulation-phase-since-january-as-btc-price-passes-110k,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Glassnode|Deribit|Markets|News",cryptocompare

2025-05-23T07:41:46.000Z,"Is Altseason 2025 Imminent? These Signs Point to a Big Market Shift","TL;DR Bitcoin skyrocketed to another all-time high in 2025 just a day ago, and now the focus has moved toward the altcoins, as many of them struggle well below their peaks. Some of the most popular crypto content creators believe the long-anticipated altcoins season is about to start. Not Here Yet, but Maybe Soon? Going by the X moniker, Vandell, Black Swan Capitalist‚Äôs co-founder said the altcoin season hasn‚Äôt started yet, mostly because interest rates in the US remained higher for longer. Recall that the US Fed refused to lower the rates on several consecutive FOMC meetings but is anticipated to do so later this year. Vandell believes monetary expansion has begun, which will unlock the next phase and perhaps drive further capital into riskier investment options like cryptocurrencies. Here‚Äôs why altcoin season hasn‚Äôt started yet, rates stayed higher for longer, extending the business cycle, But monetary expansion is picking up, The next phase is coming. pic.twitter.com/lAXa5otv3K ‚Äî Vandell | Black Swan Capitalist (@vandell33) May 23, 2025 Crypto Rover asked his 1.2 million followers on X why this cycle would be any different from all the previous ones, in which there was always an altseason at the end. Coinvo believes the best time to get rich via altcoins is coming, even though it might not feel like it now. AltcoinGordon noted that ETH‚Äôs climb to and just over $2,700 is a clear sign that the altcoin season is upon us. The asset was among the poorest performers up until mid-April when it plunged from $4,000 to under $1,400 since the December peak. However, it picked up the pace in the past month and now sits around that level. ETH is at $2,700 Alt season is coming Are you prepared? pic.twitter.com/mBSRFqDqwi ‚Äî Gordon (@AltcoinGordon) May 23, 2025 Falling Bitcoin Dominance Perhaps the most vital metric that demonstrates in which way the tides are going in the cryptocurrency space is Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance. The higher it goes, the more BTC dominates the market, and vice versa. After the US elections, it flew to almost 62% on TradingView but plunged below 55% in early December when alts were skyrocketing. However, it has been gradually increasing in the past few months and peaked above 65% on May 7. Since then, it dropped to 62 before it recovered some ground to 63.5% as of now. Bitcoin Dominance on TradingView Although it‚Äôs still very early and the metric hasn‚Äôt really lost any steam, Carl Moon seemed optimistic that these are the initial signs indicating that the altcoins season is ‚Äúimminent.‚Äù BITCOIN DOMINANCE IS FALLING! ALTCOIN SEASON IS IMMINENT! pic.twitter.com/cPFCoceTVl ‚Äî Carl Moon (@TheMoonCarl) May 22, 2025 Then again, it‚Äôs worth noting that BTC and the crypto market as a whole often move in the opposite direction of what people expect, so this many analysts and influencers waiting for an altseason might not be good news for altcoin holders.

2025-05-23T07:30:00.000Z,"Best Altcoin to Buy Today: Here‚Äôs the Next Crypto to Explode After Bitcoin and Ethereum","As Bitcoin hovers above $100,000 and Ethereum gains strength near $2500, seasoned investors are shifting focus to the next crypto to explode with bigger breakout potential. While BTC and ETH remain anchors of any solid portfolio, the biggest short-term gains often come from smaller, undervalued altcoins poised for rapid growth. In the current market, identifying the best crypto to buy today means looking beyond the giants and finding the low-cap gems with strong fundamentals, innovative utility, and viral momentum. Smart money is flowing into high-upside opportunity, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a rising star in the altcoin market that could be the breakout story of 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has successfully completed Phase 4 of its presale, raising a cumulative total of $9.1 million from over 11,000 token purchasers. The structured presale model has currently set the token price at $0.03 in phase 5, accelerating progress toward a Phase 6 price of $0.035 per MUTM, a 16.67% rise. With a 200% gain already achieved since its initial launch, MUTM is set to officially launch at $0.06, offering current buyers a guaranteed 100% return on investment (2x ROI). Presale Gaining Momentum: Mutuum Finance Leads the Charge Mutuum Finance presale sold out Phase 4 earlier than expected, and the momentum is intensifying. The presale is now in phase 5 available at $0.03. Those quick on the uptake can lock in a 16.67% profit when the next price tier comes into play. With demand comes increased anticipation of even more dramatic profits at launch. With sound tokenomics and practical DeFi applications, MUTM is shaping up fast to be a breakout player in the 2025 altcoin conversation. Revolutionary Buy-and-Distribute Model Contributes to Long-Term Value Mutuum Finance carries out a unique buy-and-distribute process, unlike other many other speculation tokens. By doing this the periodic purchasing of tokens from the market and providing them to the MUTM stakers helps sustain the model and brings long term participation and thus reduces supply. This structure should increase price rise and encourage constant use from users. mtToken System Unlocks Passive Yield With Full Liquidity Mutuum Finance brings a new innovation to mtToken features, the ability to earn yield from assets outside the normal procedure of locking them. Users are not locking up holdings, they can freely use their assets and earn passively as well, which is a valuable change to DeFi users who appreciate revenue and usability. In addition, borrowers are able to easily access USDT using the platform‚Äôs collateralized loan provision, conformed to given ratio patterns. For example, $7,000 of ETH collateral can be used to unlock $5,000 stablecoins, the process being carried out via open source smart contracts. Stable, Secure, and Built to Last Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin to be issued on the Ethereum network. Its overcollateralized design ensures long-term price stability, eschewing the collapse risks which have plagued algorithmic stablecoins. On the security front, the platform is run by open-source, third-party audited smart contracts, laying a good foundation for user trust and institutional adoption. As Bitcoin and Ethereum regain momentum, savvy investors are turning their attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a high-potential altcoin poised for breakout success. The project has already attracted over 11,000 early investors and raised $9.1 million, signaling strong market confidence. A current token price of $0.03 offers a unique opportunity for a 100% ROI before its expected launch at $0.06. Thanks to its mtToken yield system, dual lending model, and fully collateralized USD-backed stablecoin, Mutuum Finance stands out as a serious DeFi contender. The window to buy before the 16.67% price increase in Phase 6 is closing fast, this may be the best entry point for exponential returns in 2025.

2025-05-23T07:29:47.000Z,"HYPE reaches an all-time high as Hyperliquid talks to CFTC for US compliance","Hyperliquid (HYPE) was one of the outliers during the recent Bitcoin (BTC) rally to new records. The high-leverage DEX is now looking to become more compliant and tap larger, well-established markets. HYPE is becoming a staple of crypto trading, growing its open interest in recent days to rival large centralized exchanges. The recent peak performance for multiple trading pairs drew the attention of regulators. Hyperliquid responded, by detailing its DeFi activity in two letters to the US Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The letters were a response for an official request on the side of the CFTC for more clarity about the activities of the on-chain perpetual DEX. The perpetual futures DEX aims to become compliant and continue to offer DeFi in established, regulated crypto markets. The following post is from Hyperliquid Labs Hyperliquid Labs is committed to the advancement of defi and its promise in delivering a more open, transparent, and efficient financial system for all. As a contributor to the Hyperliquid blockchain, we believe in defi‚Äôs ability not‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Hyperliquid (@HyperliquidX) May 23, 2025 Following the engagement with the CFTC, Hyperliquid continued to expand its open interest. The exchange recovered its value locked from the April lows, up to $440M once again. Hyperliquid also proved it was relatively resilient to liquidations and aggressive traders. Hyperliquid had to present its conditions for 24/7 trading, by securing sufficient liquidity, collateral management, resilience, and compliance with regulations. The DEX team wanted to prove its platform was robust enough to become a part of mainstream trading tools. The perpetual futures DEX works with pre-funded collateral, where traders first transact on-chain to secure their collateral, mostly eliminating the risk of banking bottlenecks. However, for some traders, even crypto transactions may be slowed down by unexpected factors. The DEX offers continuous trading with constant pricing information, and automated liquidation once the position no longer covers its margin requirements. The DEX also has partial liquidations and traders have access to oracles and warnings to increase collateral. Hyperliquid trades at an all-time high The native token, HYPE, continued its growth to a new all-time high. HYPE recovered and continued its rally with near-vertical gains, to $34.69. HYPE briefly peaked above $35.10, becoming one of the trending tokens for the second day in a row. HYPE extended its rally above $35, boosted by high trading activity and community enthusiasm. | Source: CoinGecko HYPE open interest also expanded to an all-time high of $1.15B, with near-record trading volumes of $500M. HYPE once again revived its community hype, as being one of the airdrop tokens that share the platform‚Äôs profits, and appreciate without insider selling. The confidence in HYPE may lead to an extended rally, especially after the growth of open interest on the exchange. In the past week, Hyperliquid posted several records, with open interest rising above $8.9B for all markets. The HYPE rally also led to liquidations for leveraged whales that bet against the token. One of the whales took a position valued at over 30.5M USDC. The position closed with over $23M in losses after a few hours of the HYPE rally. The Hyperliquid ecosystem aims to rival Solana with its native chain and the Hyperliquid EVM, compatible with Ethereum. Hyperliquid also expects inflows from other ecosystems, as Layer Zero recently introduced a new bridge for stablecoins and other tokens.

2025-05-23T07:12:47.000Z,"Sell signal for 2 overbought cryptocurrencies to avoid this weekend","The cryptocurrency market has resumed its bullish trend, led by Bitcoin ( BTC ), which is trading at a new record high above $110,000. However, this optimism, driven by increased buying pressure from investors, has led to overbought conditions for specific cryptocurrencies , making them risky bets for traders heading into the weekend. In this context, below are two overbought assets to hold off on trading, as they currently exhibit elevated Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) levels. Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin is trading at $110,975, surpassing its last record high. However, the asset‚Äôs RSI values across multiple timeframes suggest caution. For example, the RSI reads 50.82 on the one-hour chart, 65.38 over four hours, 69.28 over 12 hours, and 74.53 over the past 24 hours. BTC RSI reading. Source: Coinglass Notably, an RSI above 70 typically indicates overbought conditions, and Bitcoin‚Äôs 24-hour RSI signals the potential for a pullback as buying pressure begins to ease. It‚Äôs worth noting that Bitcoin rallied and broke above its all-time high of $109,588 on May 21, sustaining its bullish momentum and hitting another record price of $111,980 the following day. Given the elevated RSI levels, if Bitcoin faces a retracement, the next key support level to watch is $105,000. Nonetheless, Bitcoin continues to attract increased capital inflows as more investors view the asset as a potential hedge amid global economic uncertainty. Worldcoin (WLD) Worldcoin ( WLD ) has also experienced a significant rally, posting a massive 24-hour gain of 22%, bringing its price to $1.544. However, this sharp move has pushed its RSI into overbought territory, particularly on longer timeframes: 67.08 (1 hour), 76.06 (4 hours), 75.59 (12 hours), and 72.06 (24 hours). WLD RSI reading. Source: Coinglass The four-hour and 12-hour RSI readings above 70 suggest that Worldcoin‚Äôs momentum may be unsustainable in the short term, increasing the likelihood of a price correction. Although WLD‚Äôs rally aligns with the broader market trend, it received an additional boost from the Worldcoin Foundation‚Äôs $135 million token sale, led by a16z and Bain Capital Crypto. The funds will expand Orb-verified World IDs and accelerate the rollout of Worldcoin‚Äôs identity network in major U.S. cities. In summary, high RSI levels suggest potential pullbacks, but they don‚Äôt guarantee a correction. In strong uptrends, assets can stay overbought longer than expected, so investors should consider multiple indicators.

2025-05-23T07:07:58.000Z,"Psy Develops First Trustless Bridge from Dogecoin to Solana","BitcoinWorld Psy Develops First Trustless Bridge from Dogecoin to Solana Hong Kong, China, 22nd May 2025, Chainwire Solana users will be able to transact with Dogecoin securely, powered by Psy and Wormhole, tapping into a $36B asset and its vast community for DeFi, gaming & more. Psy (formerly QED Protocol) has developed a trustless bridge connecting Dogecoin to the Solana blockchain. This innovation brings proof-of-work security to Solana while making Dogecoin, the world‚Äôs largest memecoin, available to Solana‚Äôs ecosystem of dapps. This innovation allows Solana and Dogecoin to directly ‚Äòspeak‚Äô to each other, with each blockchain able to independently verify the other‚Äôs transactions and consensus without requiring trust in third parties. The bridge not only enhances security but also creates substantial ecosystem opportunities. Bringing Dogecoin‚Äôs $36B+ market cap and massive community to Solana opens new possibilities for both networks. Dogecoin users gain access to Solana‚Äôs DeFi, NFT, and gaming applications, while Solana developers can tap into Dogecoin‚Äôs extensive user base. Unlike traditional bridges, which often rely on multisig signers or custodians, Psy‚Äôs next-generation proof-of-work technology validates Dogecoin Proof of Work consensus directly on Solana. This trust-minimized approach helps address a major weakness in crypto infrastructure: bridge hacks, which have caused more than $2.8 billion in losses to date. This positions Psy as the leading proof-of-work innovator for Solana, bridging the security benefits of proof-of-work with Solana‚Äôs speed and programmability. This integration demonstrates that new proof-of-work chains, like Psy‚Äôs, can interact with high-performance blockchains without sacrificing security or requiring centralized intermediaries. This bridge continues Psy Protocol‚Äôs mission to empower developers to build hyper-scalable web3 applications to host the next generation of the decentralized internet. The bridge supports standard Dogecoin wallets and exchange deposits. Quotes ‚ÄúWe have been working hard to find ways to better serve the Doge community, and now we get the chance to offer them even greater utility for their Dogecoin,‚Äù Carter Feldman, CEO of Psy Protocol, said. ‚ÄúThis demonstrates the promise of combining best-in-class security with user demand and an established developer base.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre thrilled to announce the DOGE bridge to Solana, a big step in welcoming one of crypto‚Äôs most iconic communities to the Solana ecosystem,‚Äù said Lily Liu, President of the Solana Foundation. ‚ÄúDOGE, Bitcoin‚Äôs beloved pet, embodies the fun, irreverent spirit that drives on-chain culture. By bridging DOGE into Solana‚Äôs network, we‚Äôre inviting the Dogecoin community‚Äîand all OG crypto enthusiasts‚Äîto join us in marrying on-chain culture and decentralized finance.‚Äù ‚ÄúTrustless verification has always been the holy grail of interoperability, but achieving it at scale has remained elusive,‚Äù said Robinson Burkey, co-founder of Wormhole. ‚ÄúSeeing Psy and Wormhole come together to build this around an asset like DOGE captures the true cyberpunk spirit of crypto. We‚Äôre excited to help bring a $36B asset to Solana‚Äîsoon to be powered by Wormhole.‚Äù How the Bridge Works The bridge captures and verifies each Dogecoin block header on Solana. Block headers contain essential blockchain data, including the previous block hash, timestamp, difficulty target, the Merkle root of all transactions in the block, and the Proof of Work consensus algorithm. By verifying these headers directly on Solana, the system cryptographically confirms the validity of Dogecoin transactions without intermediaries. When users send DOGE to the bridge, the system verifies the deposit on the Dogecoin blockchain and mints an equivalent amount of QDOGE tokens on Solana. To convert back, QDOGE tokens are burned on Solana, with withdrawal messages securely transmitted through Wormhole‚Äôs cross-chain messaging protocol, triggering the release of the original DOGE to the user‚Äôs Dogecoin address. To enable this bridge, Psy has created a suite of infrastructure for developers: txindex: a fully-featured indexer for Dogecoin with effortless handling of forking behavior electrs-doge: the first open-source block explorer for Dogecoin doge-sdk: the first JavaScript SDK for Dogecoin forkr: an easy-to-use tool for simulating forks/re-orgs on Bitcoin and Dogecoin. About Psy Protocol Psy is the leading innovator in next-generation proof-of-work technology, on a mission to restore the security and decentralization principles of blockchain while enabling modern scalability. Psy is bridging the utility gap between Proof of Work and Proof of Stake chains, empowering developers to build hyper-scalable web3 applications, to provide a credible alternative to a centralized internet controlled by a handful of tech monopolies.

2025-05-23T07:04:46.000Z,"‚ÄòThings Are About To Get Silly‚Äô: Analyst Says Bitcoin on Cusp of Most Aggressive Expansion Since Inception","A widely followed analyst and trader believes Bitcoin ( BTC ) is set to go even higher after recently hitting a new all-time high. The analyst, pseudonymously known as Credible Crypto, tells his 467,200 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin is now in the final phase of a bullish cycle. Credible Crypto, who regularly applies the Elliott Wave theory in his technical analysis, says Bitcoin is in the final wave of the main bullish trend. The Elliott Wave theory states that the main trend of the price of an asset moves in a five-wave pattern while a correction occurs in a three-wave pattern. ‚ÄúRegardless of how this month closes ‚Äì the fact that our monthly Relative Strength Index (RSI) is pushing into overbought territory once again means that things are about to get silly.

This will be the MOST AGGRESSIVE EXPANSION we have seen on Bitcoin SINCE INCEPTION.‚Äù The RSI is a momentum oscillator calibrated from zero to 100, with a reading of above 70 indicating overbought conditions and a reading of under 30 signaling oversold conditions. According to the pseudonymous analyst, Bitcoin recorded massive increases in price when the RSI reading on the monthly time frame reached overbought levels. ‚ÄúThe last two times we did this, the monthly candles that broke us into overbought territories were $22,200 and $33,000 large, respectively.

2025-05-23T07:00:07.000Z,"MAGACOIN FINANCE Climbing Again ‚Äî While XRP, Solana, and Bitcoin Enter Sideways Consolidation","As the crypto market transitions into Q3 2025, a new pattern is emerging: while heavyweights like XRP, Solana, and Bitcoin are consolidating in narrow ranges, MAGACOIN FINANCE is breaking out with renewed momentum. With analysts and traders searching for the next big move, attention is shifting to early-stage tokens where the risk/reward profile is most attractive. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its viral narrative and presale scarcity, is quickly becoming the standout candidate for exponential gains as the broader market pauses. Bitcoin: Macro Strength, But Momentum Pauses Bitcoin (BTC) remains the bellwether for the entire crypto market, holding firm above $105,000 after reaching new all-time highs in May. Institutional inflows, ETF adoption, and post-halving scarcity continue to provide a strong foundation for BTC, with forecasts for Q3 ranging from $110,000 to $150,000. However, as trading volume cools and the monthly RSI signals overbought conditions, Bitcoin‚Äôs price action has entered a period of sideways consolidation. This lull is prompting investors to rotate capital into altcoins with higher upside potential, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a primary beneficiary of this shift. JOIN NOW ‚Äî $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Solana: Range-Bound, but Fundamentals Remain Strong Solana (SOL) is trading between $158 and $175, with technical analysts watching for a breakout above $175 to retest resistance at $183 3 . While the network‚Äôs DeFi activity, developer engagement, and institutional adoption remain robust, price action has flattened as traders await the next catalyst. Forecasts for June and July remain bullish, with some projecting SOL could reach $180‚Äì$210 if macro conditions stay favorable. Yet, as Solana‚Äôs volatility cools, speculative capital is increasingly seeking sharper returns in early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the entry price and upside potential are far more compelling. XRP: Bullish Outlook, but Facing Resistance XRP is holding steady at $2.35, having surged over 300% since late 2024 and now consolidating just below key resistance. Legal clarity, ETF speculation, and strong technicals have positioned XRP for a potential move to $2.80‚Äì$3.40 in the coming weeks, with some analysts targeting $5.50‚Äì$15 by year-end if bullish momentum persists. However, with the token trading in a tight range and whale accumulation slowing, many traders are diversifying into early-stage opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which offers a much lower entry point and the kind of upside that legacy assets can‚Äôt match. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Viral Growth and Breakout Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly distinguishing itself as the most dominant presale of 2025, with analysts projecting up to 100x returns from current entry levels. The project‚Äôs capped 100 billion token supply, Hashex-audited contracts, and political meme narrative have created a perfect storm of demand, driving each presale stage to sell out faster than the last. With a confirmed listing price of $0.007 and a limited-time 50% bonus for early buyers using the promo code PATRIOT50X , MAGA‚Äôs early-stage momentum is attracting both retail and institutional capital. As the broader market consolidates, MAGACOIN FINANCE is climbing the watchlists of traders seeking the next breakout, and some models even suggest a $1 target by year-end‚Äîa move that would eclipse the returns of most established altcoins. HBAR and the Quiet Altcoin Rotation Hedera (HBAR) continues to build quietly, focusing on enterprise partnerships and real-world integrations. While HBAR‚Äôs fundamentals remain strong, its price action has lagged behind the more explosive moves seen in MAGACOIN FINANCE and other high-momentum presales. As capital rotates out of sideways-trading assets, early-stage opportunities like MAGA are capturing the attention of traders looking for the next 10x‚Äì100x play. CLICK HERE ‚Äì ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF Conclusion As XRP, Solana, and Bitcoin enter periods of sideways consolidation, MAGACOIN FINANCE is climbing again‚Äîfueled by viral growth, presale scarcity, and a clear roadmap to exchange listings. With analysts forecasting up to 100x returns and a 50% bonus available for early buyers using PATRIOT50X , MAGA stands out as the top early-stage opportunity for Q3 2025. For traders seeking the next explosive move, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the breakout altcoin to watch as the cycle heats up.

From Wall Street giants to crypto-savvy politicians, the United States is taking center stage in Bitcoin‚Äôs latest bull run. But it‚Äôs now a global race for control, and the two main players are the United States and China. The U.S. Is Holding More Bitcoin Than Ever Recent data from the on-chain analytical platform CryptoQuant shows that U.S.-based entities, including banks, exchanges, and funds, are now holding a bigger chunk of Bitcoin than the rest of the world. This strong buying activity recently triggered a bullish chart pattern known as a golden cross on the U.S. to Rest Reserve Ratio chart, which often signals a potential price surge. In the past, this type of signal marked the beginning of major uptrends. We saw it last year, and now it‚Äôs happening again. This shift is helping fuel the recent price jump, along with optimism over new U.S. crypto laws and growing interest from major names like Michael Saylor‚Äôs MicroStrategy, Tesla, Semler Scientific, and many more. Meanwhile, the U.S currently holds overall 207,189 BTC worth around 22.99 billion. Political Winds Are Blowing Bitcoin‚Äôs Way There‚Äôs also growing political support for crypto in the U.S. As President Donald Trump recently voiced strong support for crypto , even saying he wants the U.S. to lead Bitcoin mining and become the ‚Äúcrypto capital of the world.‚Äù Combined with new Senate talks around stablecoin laws, the U.S. is pushing hard to attract crypto innovation. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Strategy Announces Plan to Raise $2.1B to Strengthen Bitcoin Holdings: BTC Price Hits New ATH , Bullish Now, But Caution Ahead While things look good now, CryptoQuant‚Äôs chart also highlights what could come next. The last two times this ratio formed a ‚Äúdeath cross,‚Äù when the short-term trend drops below the long-term, Bitcoin took a hit shortly after. So while it‚Äôs a party now, history says to keep an eye out. China Is Still a Big Player Even though the U.S is leading the race, but China quietly remains one of the biggest holders and miners of Bitcoin through indirect channels. While much of the trading is hidden or rerouted, China‚Äôs grip on mining and holding power is real, and the U.S. doesn‚Äôt want to be left behind. Although China currently holds overall 194,000 BTC, worth around 21.53 billion. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-23T06:44:17.000Z,"MicroStrategy Announces Massive $2.1B Preferred Stock Offering with 10% Dividend","BitcoinWorld MicroStrategy Announces Massive $2.1B Preferred Stock Offering with 10% Dividend In a significant financial move, MicroStrategy, the software intelligence firm known for its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy, is reportedly planning to issue up to $2.1 billion in preferred stock. This potential offering, first reported by Walter Bloomberg on X, carries a notable 10% annual dividend, signaling a strategic decision by the company to potentially raise substantial capital. What is MicroStrategy Preferred Stock and What‚Äôs Being Offered? MicroStrategy preferred stock represents a class of ownership in the company that has a higher claim on assets and earnings than common stock. Holders of preferred stock typically receive fixed dividends before common shareholders and have priority in the event of liquidation. However, they usually do not have voting rights. According to the report, MicroStrategy is aiming to issue up to $2.1 billion worth of this preferred stock. The specific terms and conditions will be detailed in the offering documents, but the headline figure of $2.1 billion suggests a substantial capital raise. This isn‚Äôt MicroStrategy‚Äôs first foray into raising capital through debt or equity to fund its Bitcoin purchases, but the scale and the nature of preferred stock make this particular move noteworthy. Understanding the Attractive 10% Dividend Yield One of the most striking features of this potential offering is the proposed 10% annual dividend. A 10% yield on preferred stock is relatively high in the current market environment, especially for a company like MicroStrategy. This high dividend rate is likely intended to attract a wide range of investors, particularly those seeking income streams. For investors, a 10% dividend offers a potentially attractive return on investment, paid out before common stock dividends (though MicroStrategy does not currently pay a common stock dividend). However, the high yield also implicitly suggests a level of risk perceived by the market or structured into the offering to make it appealing despite other potential factors like market volatility or the company‚Äôs specific business model tied heavily to Bitcoin. How Does This Fuel MicroStrategy‚Äôs Bitcoin Strategy? MicroStrategy‚Äôs primary corporate strategy under Michael Saylor has been to acquire and hold Bitcoin. The company has consistently used various financial instruments, including convertible senior notes and stock offerings, to raise capital specifically for purchasing more Bitcoin. This $2.1 billion preferred stock offering appears to be another mechanism to further that core objective. By issuing preferred stock, MicroStrategy can raise significant capital without diluting the voting power of its common shareholders (as preferred stock typically has no voting rights). The capital raised would likely be used to acquire more Bitcoin, increasing the company‚Äôs overall BTC holdings. This move aligns perfectly with MicroStrategy‚Äôs stated goal of being a corporate vehicle for investing in Bitcoin. The company‚Äôs balance sheet is increasingly dominated by its Bitcoin holdings. Raising capital through preferred stock adds to its liabilities but increases its capacity to accumulate more digital assets, reinforcing its unique position among publicly traded companies. Is This MicroStrategy Investment Opportunity Right for You? Investing in MicroStrategy preferred stock comes with its own set of considerations, distinct from investing in the common MSTR stock or Bitcoin directly. Potential investors should weigh the benefits against the risks: Potential Benefits: Attractive Income: The 10% annual dividend offers a potentially high fixed return. Priority in Liquidation: Preferred shareholders have a higher claim on company assets than common shareholders if the company were to be liquidated. Potential for Capital Appreciation: While the primary draw is the dividend, the market price of preferred stock can fluctuate based on interest rates, company performance, and market sentiment. Potential Risks: Subordination to Debt: Preferred stock is subordinate to the company‚Äôs debt obligations. If MicroStrategy faced financial distress, debt holders would be paid before preferred shareholders. Call Risk: The company may have the right to ‚Äòcall‚Äô or redeem the preferred stock at a certain price after a specific date, potentially limiting the investor‚Äôs income stream if interest rates fall. Market Risk: The value of the preferred stock can be affected by changes in interest rates and the overall market‚Äôs perception of MicroStrategy and the cryptocurrency market. No Voting Rights: Preferred shareholders typically do not have a say in company management decisions. Tied to Bitcoin Volatility: While preferred stock offers a fixed dividend, the company‚Äôs underlying health and ability to pay that dividend are heavily influenced by the volatile price of Bitcoin, which constitutes a significant portion of its assets. Investors interested in this specific MicroStrategy investment should carefully review the official offering documents once they are released to understand the full terms, conditions, and risks. Potential Impact on MSTR Stock and the Market The issuance of $2.1 billion in preferred stock could have several implications for MicroStrategy‚Äôs common stock (MSTR stock) and the broader market: Funding for Bitcoin: If the capital is used to buy more Bitcoin, it reinforces MicroStrategy‚Äôs commitment to its Bitcoin strategy and could be seen positively by investors bullish on Bitcoin. Increased demand from MSTR could also have a minor impact on Bitcoin‚Äôs price. Increased Leverage: This offering adds another layer of financing to MicroStrategy‚Äôs capital structure, increasing its overall leverage. While leverage can amplify gains when asset values rise, it also magnifies losses if asset values decline. Market Perception: A large preferred stock offering with a high dividend yield could be interpreted in different ways by the market. Some may see it as an aggressive, confident move to capitalize on market conditions, while others might view the high yield as indicative of higher risk or a costlier way to raise funds compared to other options. Potential for Future Capital Raises: Success with this offering might pave the way for future similar capital-raising activities. The market‚Äôs reaction will depend on the final terms of the offering and the prevailing sentiment towards both MicroStrategy and Bitcoin at the time. Conclusion: A Bold Financial Maneuver MicroStrategy‚Äôs reported plan to issue up to $2.1 billion in preferred stock with a 10% dividend is a bold financial maneuver that underscores the company‚Äôs unwavering commitment to its Bitcoin strategy. This offering provides MicroStrategy with significant capital to potentially expand its Bitcoin holdings, further solidifying its position as a unique investment vehicle for gaining exposure to the digital asset. For investors, the preferred stock offers a high-yield income opportunity but comes with risks related to MicroStrategy‚Äôs leveraged balance sheet and the inherent volatility of Bitcoin. As always, potential investors should conduct thorough due diligence and consider their own risk tolerance and investment goals before participating in such an offering.

2025-05-23T06:41:47.000Z,"London Uber Driver steals $123k in crypto after drugging American Tourist","A U.S. tourist was drugged and robbed in London by an Uber driver who made off with $123,000 in cryptocurrency. According to local media , the victim, 30-year-old Jacob Irwin-Cline, was visiting the UK on a short layover when the incident occurred. After a night out in Soho, he called an Uber to return to his hostel, but instead, he ended up getting into a different vehicle with a driver who appeared to match the profile shown in his app. Cline told reporters that the driver, who introduced himself as ‚ÄúMohammed,‚Äù flagged him down using the name saved in the Uber app and seemed friendly enough to gain his trust. The vehicle, however, didn‚Äôt match the make and model listed on Cline‚Äôs phone. Once inside, the driver offered him a cigarette that Cline now believes was laced with a powerful sedative. He said he quickly became disoriented and passed out, waking up later to find himself on the street, his phone, which held access to his crypto wallets, gone. You might also like: Sui-based Cetus Protocol offers $6M bounty to hacker after $223M exploit Cline confirmed the $123,000 loss, stating that despite reaching out to the FBI‚Äôs cybercrime unit, he holds little hope of recovering the funds. The incident adds to a troubling trend of crypto-related crimes targeting unsuspecting investors and tourists. As the popularity of digital assets continues to grow, so too do the risks for those holding substantial amounts on mobile wallets or unsecured devices. Just weeks earlier, the father of a crypto exchange founder was kidnapped in France by a criminal gang demanding ransom. In a separate case, the daughter and grandson of Paymium CEO Pierre Noizat were the victims of an attempted abduction in broad daylight in Paris. It prompted French authorities to roll out special protections for crypto professionals and their families, including priority police access and home security checks, following a spate of similar attacks. Meanwhile, in the U.S., three teens in Florida reportedly kidnapped a man after a crypto event in Las Vegas, forcing him to transfer millions in digital assets before abandoning him in the desert.

2025-05-23T06:41:32.000Z,"OKX Launches xBTC on Aptos Blockchain to Enhance Bitcoin-Backed DeFi","OKX, a blockchain technology company that also operates one of the largest crypto exchanges globally, is launching xBTC, a wrapped version of bitcoin (BTC) on the layer-1 blockchain Aptos. According to a press release sent to CryptoPotato , the launch will give Aptos users access to wrapped BTC without any minting or redemption fees required. OKX Unveils xBTC on Aptos xBTC is backed 1:1 by bitcoins held in OKX‚Äôs custody. Starting May 22, Aptos users will be able to mint xBTC on OKX, deposit, or withdraw to the blockchain. They can use the asset across several Aptos-native decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, including trading and lending. This development unlocks new utilities for Bitcoin and Aptos DeFi, as BTC remains the most dominant and trusted cryptocurrency. Aptos Foundation, an organization dedicated to fostering development on the Aptos chain, revealed that the network has a DeFi ecosystem with more than $1 billion in total value locked (TVL). The blockchain has recorded strong momentum behind wrapped BTC assets, as seen in Echo protocol‚Äôs aBTC, which boasts over $270 million in TVL. Echo Protocol is a Bitcoin liquid re-staking and yield solutions platform. The foundation believes xBTC will unlock more liquidity, cross-chain interoperability, and access to DeFi protocols in the Aptos ecosystem. Ash Pampati, Head of Ecosystem at Aptos Foundation, said: ‚ÄúAptos was built for real-world open finance applications, and Bitcoin is the linchpin between traditional and decentralized finance markets. Being one of the first blockchains to support xBTC is a testament to the network‚Äôs high performance, security, and scalability. This opens up new avenues for liquidity and ecosystem growth while giving developers the confidence and tools to seize them.‚Äù OKX to Launch Special Campaign for xBTC Meanwhile, OKX intends to kickstart a special campaign for xBTC on May 23 to prepare for deeper integrations across the Aptos ecosystem in the coming weeks. The company will partner with Echo Protocol, the decentralized margin trading chain Aries Markets, and the decentralized map ecosystem Hyperion for the campaign. ‚ÄúDelivering seamless usability and access to on-chain use cases is core to what we‚Äôve been building at OKX. By bringing xBTC to Aptos, we are keen to see Bitcoin holders put their BTC to work in fast, low-cost DeFi applications while enjoying the security and transparency they‚Äôve come to expect from us,‚Äù said OKX chief innovation officer Jason Lau.

In reality, it served as a front for a Bitcoin exchange service that bypassed federal anti-money laundering requirements. Between 2017 and 2020, Nguyen converted over $1m in cash to Bitcoin, including $250,000 for someone who told him they were a meth dealer. Under federal law, virtual currency exchangers are classified as money transmitters and must register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN. They are also required to maintain anti-money laundering programs and file reports on large or suspicious transactions. Nguyen did neither, despite handling multiple six-figure sums for clients involved in criminal activity and scams. Federal Jury Found Nguyen Knowingly Bypassed Laws Protecting Fraud Victims The Justice Department revealed that Nguyen processed hundreds of thousands of dollars for romance scam victims. These victims had been tricked into sending Bitcoin to fraudsters overseas. In addition, Nguyen used encrypted messaging to communicate with clients. He also avoided reporting thresholds by breaking up large deposits. Further, he took a course that advised him to create a cover story and never mention Bitcoin. Nguyen was indicted in May 2023 and convicted more than a year later after a federal jury found he deliberately flouted laws designed to prevent financial crimes. Authorities said his actions not only helped criminals hide their tracks, but also put vulnerable victims at further risk. Separately this week, a federal jury in the Eastern District of New York convicted former SafeMoon CEO Braden Karony of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, wire fraud and money laundering. The 12-day trial began on May 5. Karony now faces up to 45 years in prison and the forfeiture of illicit gains.

2025-05-23T06:27:05.000Z,"Metaplanet Stock Undervalued Despite Bitcoin Surge ‚Äì Says Investor Richard Byworth","The post Metaplanet Stock Undervalued Despite Bitcoin Surge ‚Äì Says Investor Richard Byworth appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Metaplanet is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about stocks in Japan. It‚Äôs the country‚Äôs only real stock market play on Bitcoin, and right now, it looks like it‚Äôs still undervalued‚Äîeven after a huge recent price jump. According to Richard Byworth , a well-known crypto investor, Metaplanet‚Äôs current price is still low compared to the amount of Bitcoin it holds. At $10.82 per share (in its U.S. OTC version, MTPLF), the stock is trading at just over 5 times its net asset value based on Bitcoin holdings. For comparison, MicroStrategy (MSTR), a U.S. company that also holds a lot of Bitcoin , trades at only 1.75 times its Bitcoin value. Short Sellers Are Getting Trapped Metaplanet is the most shorted stock in Japan, with nearly 30% of its shares sold short. But because the stock price has been rising sharply, short sellers are stuck. The stock has hit its daily price limit up for three days in a row on the Tokyo exchange. This means it can‚Äôt be sold at a higher price during trading hours, which is making it even harder for shorts to cover their positions. Some short sellers are now facing losses of more than 300%, unable to buy shares back to close their bets. When the limits are lifted, there could be a big price move‚Äîknown as a short squeeze‚Äîthat pushes the stock much higher. Strong Bitcoin Buying and Macro Trends Metaplanet has been buying Bitcoin aggressively , giving it a Bitcoin yield that‚Äôs over 11 times higher than MicroStrategy‚Äôs based on recent purchases. This shows the company is growing its Bitcoin holdings fast. Global bond markets are showing signs of trouble. U.S. and Japanese government bond yields are rising, which often leads central banks to lower rates again. Lower interest rates tend to be good for Bitcoin and related stocks. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : MicroStrategy Records $15 Billion Profit as Bitcoin Hits All-Time High , Why Japanese Investors Like Metaplanet Holding Bitcoin directly in Japan can be expensive because capital gains are taxed as regular income at rates up to 55%. But investing in Metaplanet through Japan‚Äôs NISA accounts lets investors avoid capital gains tax on up to about $25,000 a year. This tax advantage is attracting many retail investors in Japan, since Metaplanet is currently the only easy way for them to get exposure to Bitcoin via the stock market. What‚Äôs Next for Metaplanet? Byworth suggests that if Metaplanet‚Äôs price doubled to around $21, it would be valued similarly to MicroStrategy on a Bitcoin asset basis. Even then, it would still be below its highest valuation in the past. With short sellers stuck and strong buying interest from investors, the stock could see more big moves soon. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

An analysis of average daily USD trading volumes for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and XRP across different exchanges reveals an increasing depth in XRP markets. While BTC and ETH dominate overall volume, XRP‚Äôs trading activity has become more stable and pronounced. WOW! #XRP MARKET DEPTH SHOWS GROWING MATURITY BEYOND SPECULATIVE BREAKOUT! pic.twitter.com/LModv4pZq3 ‚Äî ùìêùì∂ùìÆùìµùì≤ùìÆ (@_Crypto_Barbie) May 21, 2025 In Amelie, XRP consistently shows sustained volume activity, especially from late 2024 into early 2025, contrasting with the relatively low volume in the months leading up to November 2024. The volume spike began around the time XRP began its remarkable surge. Shortly after former SEC Chair Gary Gensler announced his resignation date in November, the digital asset began climbing, rising consistently until it hit a multi-year peak of $3.39 in January. The chart shows that the digital asset experienced its most notable volume spikes within this period. In early February, XRP took things further, posting its highest volume ever on the 1-hour chart. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Exchange Data Reinforces XRP‚Äôs Market Presence The accompanying data table on average daily trading volume by exchange further illustrates XRP‚Äôs standing. A crypto researcher recently ranked Coinbase as the top exchange for XRP by trading volume , and Amelie‚Äôs chart confirms this, with a volume of $152 million on the exchange. Coinbase takes a substantial portion of the $226.8 million recorded across all listed exchanges, while Kraken follows with $30.8 million. LMAX and Bitstamp contribute $26.4 million and $17.6 million, respectively. Compared to BTC and ETH, XRP still trails in total volume. BTC averages $1.997 billion per day across the included exchanges, and ETH averages $952.5 million. However, the proportion of XRP volume to total activity, particularly on exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken, points to growing investor engagement with the asset. Amelie pointed out that XRP‚Äôs expansion is not driven solely by speculative surges. Instead, the data suggests a shift toward more measured and sustained trading behavior. The asset is currently trading at $2.4, and has a 24-hour volume of $3.94 billion, up 35.64% from yesterday, reinforcing the increasing investor participation.

In his statement on his social media account, Kr√ºger drew attention to two important developments behind this rising expectation. First of all, Kr√ºger stated that the $5 billion FTX distribution planned to take place on May 30 could provide significant momentum to the market, and drew attention to the fact that this time, major creditors will receive payment. He stated that this development could be a positive catalyst in the market. On the other hand, Kr√ºger stated that the 90-day customs duty postponement, which will end on July 9, could put pressure on the market, and said, ‚ÄúDepending on the news flow from the White House, markets may start to worry about customs duties again 2-3 weeks in advance.‚Äù Related News: A Turning Point for Bitcoin in Europe: A Company Announces It Has Purchased BTC On the other hand, another analyst, Joao Wedson, argued that explaining the recent price movements with institutional demand discourse could be misleading.

2025-05-23T06:00:19.000Z,"BitLemons ($BLEM) Leads 2025 Crypto Surge: BTC Eyes $126K While ETH Rallies 13% ‚Äì Could This GambleFi Token Deliver the Year‚Äôs Biggest Returns?","By Marketpulse on February 22, 2025 | Market Insights The cryptocurrency market is heating up as Bitcoin pushes toward $126K and Ethereum posts impressive gains, but savvy investors are turning their attention to an emerging GambleFi powerhouse that‚Äôs already raised over $2 million and shows no signs of slowing down. While established giants battle for market dominance, BitLemons ($BLEM) is quietly positioning itself to capture a massive slice of the $450 billion traditional casino market. With dual security audits, a fully operational revenue-generating platform, and a deflationary tokenomics model that would make any investor‚Äôs mouth water, BitLemons represents the kind of early-stage opportunity that creates generational wealth. As Stage 3 of the presale rapidly fills at just $0.03 per token, the question isn‚Äôt whether you should invest‚Äîit‚Äôs whether you can afford not to. Can Bitcoin Sustain Its Push Toward $126K Despite Market Volatility? Bitcoin‚Äôs recent reclaim of the $110K psychological barrier has reignited institutional enthusiasm and retail investor confidence alike. The world‚Äôs flagship cryptocurrency is displaying textbook bullish behavior, with analysts drawing trend lines directly toward the $118K and $126K resistance zones. This momentum surge comes as macroeconomic factors align favorably, with increasing corporate treasury allocations and regulatory clarity providing sustainable tailwinds. The technical picture for Bitcoin over the past seven days reveals a story of steady accumulation and controlled volatility. Trading volume has increased by approximately 18% week-over-week, while the 20-day exponential moving average maintains its upward trajectory. The RSI sits comfortably in positive territory without approaching overbought levels, suggesting room for continued upward movement. Key support has been established around the $109,588 level, with resistance targets clearly defined at $118K and the psychological $126K zone. Is Ethereum‚Äôs 13% Surge Against Bitcoin Signaling an Altcoin Season Revival? Ethereum‚Äôs impressive performance against Bitcoin has caught the attention of seasoned traders who recognize this type of relative strength as a potential harbinger of broader altcoin momentum. The ETH/BTC pair‚Äôs 13% surge represents more than just a technical bounce‚Äîit signals a fundamental shift in market flows as investors rotate capital toward assets with higher growth potential. This rotation pattern historically precedes significant altcoin rallies that can dwarf Bitcoin‚Äôs gains. Ethereum‚Äôs seven-day price action tells a compelling story of sustained buying pressure and institutional accumulation. The network‚Äôs native token has demonstrated remarkable resilience, with trading volumes increasing by 22% compared to the previous week. Technical analysis reveals a clear break above the $2,600 resistance level, with momentum indicators suggesting further upside potential toward the $2,800-$3,000 range. Support levels have been firmly established around $2,400, providing a solid foundation for continued advancement. Why Are Smart Money Investors Flooding Into BitLemons While Others Chase Established Names? BitLemons ($BLEM) represents the convergence of two unstoppable forces: the explosive growth of cryptocurrency adoption and the massive, largely untapped potential of online gaming revenues. While Bitcoin and Ethereum battle for incremental market share gains, BitLemons is pioneering an entirely new category within the GambleFi space, backed by a fully functional crypto casino generating revenue around the clock with over 8,000 games from premium providers like Evolution and Pragmatic. The numbers behind BitLemons‚Äô presale success tell a story that would make even the most skeptical investor take notice. Stage 1 sold out in just 16 days, Stage 2 followed suit completely, and Stage 3 is already 11.23% filled with tokens priced at just $0.03. The project has secured dual security audits from SpyWolf and SolidProof‚Äîa level of validation that separates serious projects from speculative ventures. With $1 million raised in the private seed round and over $2 million total funding secured, momentum continues accelerating as each of the 13 presale stages brings higher prices, starting from $0.01 and increasing by $0.01 per stage. Could BitLemons‚Äô Revolutionary Tokenomics Model Redefine Passive Income in Crypto? The genius of BitLemons lies not just in its market timing, but in its sophisticated approach to value creation through tokenomics that reward holders while systematically reducing supply. The project allocates 30% of Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) directly to token mechanics: 15% funds aggressive buyback and burn programs that create deflationary pressure, while another 15% provides staking rewards that generate passive income for holders. This dual-mechanism approach ensures that as the platform grows and generates more revenue, token holders benefit through both price appreciation and direct distributions. Market whispers suggest a potential listing price between $0.17-$0.18, representing substantial upside from current Stage 3 pricing of $0.03. Unlike speculative projects that promise future utility, BitLemons delivers immediate value through its operational casino platform that never sleeps, generating revenue 24/7 from a global user base. The deflationary supply model, combined with high-yield staking opportunities and revenue-driven rewards, creates a perfect storm for sustained price appreciation that traditional cryptocurrencies simply cannot match. The Writing Is On The Wall: Why BitLemons Could Eclipse Both Bitcoin and Ethereum Returns in 2025 While Bitcoin eyes $126K targets and Ethereum rallies against its digital gold counterpart, the real opportunity lies in identifying the next breakthrough project before mainstream adoption. BitLemons ($BLEM) combines the best elements of DeFi innovation with real-world revenue generation, positioning early investors to capitalize on both the cryptocurrency boom and the explosive growth of online gaming. With institutional-grade security audits, a proven revenue model, and tokenomics designed to reward long-term holders, BitLemons represents the type of asymmetric opportunity that defines portfolio-changing investments. The clock is ticking as Stage 3 fills rapidly and the next price increase looms on the horizon. Every day that passes brings BitLemons closer to its anticipated exchange listings, where early investors will likely see their patience rewarded with substantial returns. Don‚Äôt let this incredible seed entry opportunity slip away while chasing the incremental gains of established cryptocurrencies.

2025-05-23T05:35:08.000Z,"CME Group Fuels XRP ETF Hope","Levi Rietveld, a respected crypto analyst and founder of Crypto Crusaders, has commented on the strong performance of XRP futures since their debut on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). In a recent post , he noted that the contracts are doing exceptionally, noting that they have pulled in almost $30 million since the launch. He also pointed to the growing interest as a possible catalyst for regulatory movement on a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). With over ten XRP spot ETF applications pending, the success and appeal of the futures contracts may influence the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission‚Äôs (SEC) stance. Strong Early Trading Points to Institutional Demand CME‚Äôs XRP futures officially launched on May 19 , including standard-sized (50,000 XRP) and micro (2,500 XRP) contracts. These contracts are cash-settled in U.S. dollars and based on the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate, which is calculated daily. The first day alone saw about $19 million in trades , while the second day added another $7 million. These figures signal substantial institutional engagement, placing XRP alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana as the only cryptocurrencies with futures contracts on CME. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The fast increase in volume suggests that XRP is increasingly seen as a viable asset in institutional portfolios. The regulated environment provided by CME offers a compliant gateway for exposure to XRP price movements, especially for firms that do not wish to hold the underlying token directly. The Path to Spot XRP ETFs The performance of the CME XRP futures has direct implications for broader regulatory developments, particularly the potential approval of a spot XRP ETF. Levi highlighted this connection, pointing out that the strong institutional demand has renewed speculation about ETFs. The swift institutional uptake in a regulated setting may strengthen the case for the SEC to approve such products. The fact that more than ten applications for spot XRP ETFs are pending further supports the notion that the market is actively preparing for such a shift. Historically, futures have played a role in ETF approval decisions, and experts have previously pointed to the lack of XRP futures as a reason why ETFs would not be approved . Bitcoin and Ethereum futures were established on CME before spot ETFs were approved in the U.S., and XRP may follow a similar trajectory if current trading patterns remain consistent.

2025-05-23T05:33:59.000Z,"XRP Could Rocket to $8 as Focus Shifts to Crypto Majors After Bitcoin's Record Run: Traders","Attention is turning to major tokens as bitcoin (BTC) set fresh highs earlier this week, with some pointing out that institutional demand and a clear regulatory environment pave the way for strong moves among the top coins. Bitcoin was hovering just under $111,000 during the Asian morning hours on Friday, seeing a slight pullback on profit-taking as is expected after upward moves. Cardano‚Äôs ADA, dogecoin (DOGE) and Solana‚Äôs SOL added as much as 4%, while ether (ETH), XRP, and BNB Chain‚Äôs BNB rose less than 1.5%. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index tracking the largest tokens by market cap, rose 1.2% in the past 24 hours. Bitget Research‚Äôs Chief Analyst Ryan Lee told CoinDesk in a Telegram message that a potential dip in bitcoin dominance could kick off a broader alt season, with high-profile names like XRP and Solana in prime position to benefit. Lee pointed to XRP‚Äôs improving regulatory clarity and recent technical breakout patterns as reasons traders are eyeing a move toward $3‚Äì$8 in the medium term. XRP recently formed a golden cross against BTC on the weekly chart ‚Äî a historically bullish signal suggesting a long-term trend reversal may be underway. The ratio has been locked in a sideways channel since late 2020, but that may now be breaking after last month‚Äôs SEC decision not to pursue further appeals against Ripple. SOL could climb toward $220‚Äì$300 on ETF speculation, while ADA shows potential for a breakout between $1 and $3, Lee added. Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a Thursday broadcast that the latest BTC move confirmed a robust trend supported by improved structural fundamentals and relatively low volatility. \""This rally feels more structurally sound than the last with less frothy momentum-chasing and stronger fundamental underpinnings,‚Äù the firm said, adding that the brief dip following BTC‚Äôs initial record high break triggered put-side profit-taking, but buyers were ‚Äúquick to reload on the upside.‚Äù Still, broader macro risks remain in play. Renewed tariff concerns, rising U.S. yields, and a stronger dollar could all inject volatility into the system, especially for altcoins, QCP said. Traders are urged to stay selective, focusing on assets with strong fundamentals and clear regulatory narratives. Meanwhile, FxPro‚Äôs Alex Kuptsikevich shared in an email that bitcoin‚Äôs sentiment index is hovering just below ‚Äúextreme greed‚Äù as of Friday, a sign that the rally may still have room to run in the coming days.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/23/xrp-could-rocket-to-8-as-focus-shifts-to-crypto-majors-after-bitcoins-record-run-traders,"BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|XRP","Markets|XRP|Bitcoin|market analysis|Top Stories|News",cryptocompare
2025-05-23T05:32:02.000Z,"BITCOIN PRICE ANALYSIS & PREDICTION (May 23) ‚Äì BTC Hits New All-Time High Following 30% Increases in a Month","Following a consistent recovery from a broad corrective phase, Bitcoin finally reached a new milestone today after over 30 days of trading. This came as a result of a major price break as bigger moves lie ahead. The recent rally in Bitcoin was initiated last month after recovering from a short-term correction level of $74.5k. This brought a renewed hope for the bulls as the price closed well at around $97k ‚Äì above March‚Äôs high. Due to a rejection, it pulled back slightly earlier this month and bounced back with a major surge above the crucial $100k level in the first week. Consolidating throughout last week with a strong close above $109.5k, it recovered fully to the top following a steady increase in demand. Breaking to a new all-time high today, Bitcoin just hinted a new macro bullish wave, and from the look of things, altcoins are expected to follow suit once it suspends the latest surge into a consolidation mode. However, it is important to note that bigger moves lie ahead for the giant crypto in the long-term as long as capital continues to flow well into the market. In fact, with the latest market sentiments and speculations, coupled with some strong fundamentals surround the market, BTC may end this cycle at around $140k. BTC‚Äôs Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Anticipating more surges above the current high of $111,888, the $115k and $120k levels would be the next bulls‚Äô target in the coming days. The previously broken all-time high of $109,588 now acts as support for the primary cryptocurrency. Below it lies $106,457. If all these supports fail in a pullback, it may revisit the $100,718 level before rebounding.

2025-05-23T05:30:00.000Z,"Tourist Loses $123K in Bitcoin in London as Crypto Criminal Activity Surges","A disturbing robbery in London and a major sentencing in Boston this week have drawn attention to the expanding threat landscape surrounding cryptocurrency. In the UK, an American tourist was reportedly drugged with a powerful sedative and robbed of $123,000 in Bitcoin after mistaking a fake taxi driver for his Uber ride. The attacker fled with the victim‚Äôs smartphone, which held the private keys to his crypto wallet. Just days earlier in the United States, a Massachusetts man was sentenced to six years in federal prison for running a covert Bitcoin exchange masked as a vending machine company, laundering over $1 million in cash linked to scams and drug deals. Crypto Crime Wave Reaches London: American Tourist Drugged and Robbed of $123K in Bitcoin In a chilling reminder of the real-world risks tied to digital assets, an American tourist visiting the United Kingdom fell victim to a crypto-targeted mugging that left him without $123,000 in Bitcoin. The victim, identified as Jacob Irwin-Cline, recounted the traumatic ordeal to My London, revealing a sophisticated scheme involving impersonation, drugging, and digital theft. The incident began after Cline spent an evening at a bar in London. Slightly intoxicated, he ordered an Uber to take him back to his accommodation. However, instead of verifying the license plate or vehicle description, he mistakenly entered a different car driven by a man who resembled the expected Uber driver but was operating a private, unregistered vehicle. Jacob Irwin-Cline (Source: My London) What followed was a disturbing sequence of events that has raised alarm bells in both the tourism and crypto communities. According to Cline, the impersonating driver offered him a cigarette shortly after entering the vehicle. The seemingly innocent gesture turned dangerous when Cline began to feel overwhelmingly drowsy. Within minutes, Cline lost consciousness for what he estimates was approximately half an hour. By the time he regained awareness, the situation had spiraled out of control. The driver demanded that he exit the car. As Cline stepped out, the vehicle abruptly accelerated, clipping him in the process and fleeing the scene with his smartphone. The phone was not just a communication device, it also contained access to Cline‚Äôs Bitcoin wallet. His private keys, stored on the device without additional cold storage backups or multi-factor authentication, gave the thief immediate access to the $123,000 in crypto assets. Cline‚Äôs case is not isolated. It comes amid a troubling wave of violent incidents targeting crypto investors, executives, and their families. Criminals appear to be evolving their methods to exploit the growing number of individuals with significant digital holdings. Earlier this month in France, the father of a crypto exchange owner was rescued from captivity by French police, who uncovered an organized ransom operation. The unidentified exchange executive‚Äôs family was reportedly being targeted for the crypto ransom, and law enforcement intervention was critical in preventing a potentially tragic outcome. Just days later, Pierre Noizat, CEO of Paris-based crypto exchange Paymium, confirmed that his daughter and grandson were victims of an attempted kidnapping in broad daylight. The assailants, masked and coordinated, tried to force the family into a nearby vehicle before being repelled by the daughter and another individual on-site. These events have put pressure on governments, exchanges, and the broader crypto ecosystem to rethink security standards‚Äîboth digital and physical. A Call for Better Personal Security With the line between virtual wealth and real-world vulnerability continuing to blur, experts are urging individuals with substantial crypto holdings to implement stronger operational security (OpSec) protocols. This includes storing private keys in cold wallets, using multi-signature access, and avoiding sharing wealth-related information in public forums or social settings. The UK incident also raises questions about platform accountability. Ride-sharing companies like Uber have invested in safety features such as license plate verification and driver identity checks. However, this incident illustrates the dangers of noncompliance on the user side, especially when impaired or distracted. London‚Äôs Metropolitan Police have yet to make a public statement about Cline‚Äôs case but are reportedly investigating the theft. Authorities have urged tourists and residents to remain vigilant, particularly when accessing high-value accounts on mobile devices while traveling. Meanwhile, crypto platforms are being encouraged to enforce stronger security measures, including default 2FA (two-factor authentication) and enhanced alerts when access from a new device is detected. Crypto Wealth is No Longer Anonymous Cline‚Äôs experience sheds light on the hard truth that crypto wealth, once considered pseudonymous and secure, can now make individuals a high-profile target in both the digital and physical world. Social media posts, exchange account leaks, and even blockchain explorer data can hint at wallet balances and attract malicious actors. As of this writing, Cline‚Äôs stolen Bitcoin has not been recovered. Blockchain forensic firms have been contacted to trace the funds, but analysts warn that once a phone is compromised and access keys are exported or transferred, real-time recovery becomes increasingly difficult. Massachusetts Man Sentenced to 6 Years for Operating Covert Bitcoin Exchange Disguised as Vending Business In other crypto crime news, a US man accused of running a clandestine Bitcoin exchange under the guise of a vending machine business has been sentenced to six years in federal prison, capping a years-long investigation into what prosecutors called a ‚Äúno questions asked‚Äù crypto conversion service that facilitated drug deals and scams. Trung Nguyen, a resident of Danvers, Massachusetts, was sentenced by US District Court Judge Richard Stearns in a Boston courtroom on May 22. In addition to the prison term, Nguyen will serve three years of supervised release and must forfeit $1.5 million in illegal proceeds. Nguyen‚Äôs business, which operated under the name National Vending, processed more than $1 million in cash-for- Bitcoin transactions between September 2017 and October 2020, according to prosecutors. But beneath the surface, the business was anything but ordinary vending operations. Prosecutors say Trung Nguyen operated a fake vending machine business. (Source: Pacer ) Authorities revealed that Nguyen took part in an online course designed to teach individuals how to evade banking scrutiny and regulatory detection. These lessons included tips on avoiding words like ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äù in business paperwork, creating fictional supplier lists, and camouflaging illicit financial flows through legitimate-sounding fronts. According to federal filings, Nguyen‚Äôs services attracted a diverse and questionable clientele. Among them were victims of overseas romance and tech scams, who were coerced into converting cash into Bitcoin on behalf of fraudsters. In one particularly damning example, Nguyen facilitated ten transactions totaling $250,000 for a known drug dealer in 2018. At the heart of the prosecution was Nguyen‚Äôs decision to run a money-transmitting business without registering with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which is a requirement under federal anti-money laundering (AML) laws. Prosecutors alleged that Nguyen willfully ignored AML rules, failing to file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) or Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs) even when processing large sums of cash exceeding $10,000‚Äîtransactions that would typically be red-flagged by compliant financial institutions. Instead, Nguyen structured deposits by breaking up large cash sums into smaller amounts spread across multiple days and different bank branches, which is a tactic commonly known as ‚Äúsmurfing,‚Äù that is used to avoid triggering regulatory alerts. Sting Operation and Conviction Nguyen‚Äôs downfall came via a sting operation in which undercover law enforcement officers posed as clients. During several meetings, Nguyen accepted bundles of cash and returned Bitcoin while charging a commission of around 5%. He communicated through encrypted messaging platforms and reportedly used advanced privacy technologies to obscure transaction trails on the blockchain. Despite initially pleading not guilty in June 2023, Nguyen was convicted in November 2024 on one count of operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business and one count of money laundering. He was acquitted on a second money laundering charge. National Vending: A Case Study in Modern Financial Deception National Vending functioned for three years without detection by disguising its true nature. Banks processed Nguyen‚Äôs structured deposits under the assumption that they were revenue from vending operations. Crypto exchanges received fiat deposits that Nguyen claimed were business expenses. In reality, authorities said, Nguyen was functioning as a shadow exchange and turning hard cash into untraceable cryptocurrency for anyone willing to pay his commission and ask no questions. With Nguyen‚Äôs sentencing, regulators may further accelerate crackdowns on peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto exchangers and unlicensed brokers. Legal experts believe that authorities could increase enforcement actions in the coming year by leveraging blockchain analysis tools and undercover agents. While centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken have long operated under regulatory oversight, decentralized and informal conversion services continue to operate in legal gray zones. Nguyen‚Äôs prosecution signals that such loopholes are closing.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9235/tourist-loses-123-k-in-bitcoin-in-london-as-crypto-criminal-activity-surges,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-05-23T05:11:25.000Z,"Trendspotting in crypto: How to discover winning projects before the crowd","TL;DRSpotting the next big crypto project before it explodes demands data, discipline and a sharp eye for real signals. This guide explores how to identify early winners by analyzing onchain metrics, tokenomics, dev activity and community traction while avoiding the common traps of hype-driven pumps and red-flag projects.Despite the crypto space being crowded, fast-moving and full of noise, some investors manage to consistently find promising projects while they‚Äôre still under the radar.So, how do they do it?¬†Crypto trendspotters know how to read onchain data. They understand tokenomics. They read GitHub commits and follow the money. It takes more than jumping on the hype bandwagon ahead of the crowd.This guide breaks down how to find crypto projects with real potential using lessons from past winners like Solana, Arbitrum, Chainlink and even memecoins like Pepe. Along the way, it will highlight the tools that matter, red flags to avoid and the difference between organic growth and manufactured buzz.How the real winners took offSolanaWhen Solana launched in 2020, few outside of developer circles had heard of it. But it had one big edge: speed. Solana‚Äôs proof-of-history tech made it one of the fastest chains around, and it quickly became a magnet for builders, especially in DeFi and NFTs. By 2021, its ecosystem exploded with apps like Serum and Magic Eden.Early adopters who paid attention to onchain growth ‚Äî like wallet activity and DEX volume ‚Äî could see something brewing. Solana (SOL) went from under $1 to $50+ in less than a year.¬†Arbitrum¬†Arbitrum launched in 2021 as an Ethereum layer 2, but its big moment came with the Arbitrum (ARB) token airdrop in March 2023. At launch, Arbitrum was already processing more transactions than many layer 1s and had billions in total value locked (TVL) in decentralized applications (DApps).Smart investors were watching. Even before the token, the signs were there: user activity, rising liquidity and growing app adoption. When ARB dropped, the pump stuck because the foundation was real.ChainlinkChainlink is a classic example of a project with long-term utility. It doesn‚Äôt have flashy branding or meme power, but it does one thing incredibly well: feed real-world data into smart contracts.By 2024, it had become the backbone of much of DeFi, gaming and even tokenized real-world assets. If you were watching closely in 2019-2020, you saw LINK (LINK) getting integrated everywhere. That kind of early utility often flies under the radar ‚Äî until price action catches up.PEPE Coin (PEPE)Let‚Äôs not pretend memes don‚Äôt matter. Pepe (PEPE) launched in 2023 with no roadmap, no utility and no VC backing. But it hit a nerve, and the internet ran with it. The coin hit a billion-dollar market cap within weeks.That kind of run is rare ‚Äî and risky. But for traders tracking social sentiment, wallet distribution and community activity, the early signals were all there. PEPE didn‚Äôt promise anything, but it delivered returns by becoming a viral moment.How to find crypto gems earlySo, how do you separate the next Solana from the next rug pull? Here‚Äôs how serious trendspotters approach it.1. Start with onchain metricsPublic blockchains are transparent. Use that to look at:Daily active walletsTransaction volumeTokenholder growthLiquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs)TVL (for DeFi projects).If users and capital are moving in ‚Äî before the token moons ‚Äî that‚Äôs a great sign. Tools like Dune Analytics, Nansen and DefiLlama are your best friends here.2. Understand the tokenomicsAsk questions like:What‚Äôs the total supply? How much is circulating?Are there upcoming unlocks or vesting cliffs?Who holds the tokens, and how concentrated are the top wallets?Is there utility? Does the token do anything?Tokens with capped supply, smart incentives (like staking or burn mechanisms) and fair distribution models tend to do better long-term.3. Check developer activityIs the team actually building?GitHub is a goldmine. Look at how often code is pushed, how many contributors are active, and whether the repo looks alive. No updates for months? Big red flag.You don‚Äôt need to read code ‚Äî just track commits and releases. Projects with real traction are always shipping.4. Look for ecosystem signalsAre other developers building on top of it? Are DApps launching? Is liquidity growing? Are users coming back week after week?Ecosystem growth is hard to fake, and it‚Äôs often the strongest early indicator that a project has legs.5. Follow the communityX, Discord, Telegram, Reddit ‚Äî yes, it‚Äôs noisy. But it‚Äôs also where trends start. Look beyond the price talk:Are people actually using the product?Are devs answering questions?Is the tone constructive or just hype?Use LunarCrush or Santiment to track social momentum, but always double-check it with onchain data.Key tools to spot crypto trendsHere‚Äôs a quick rundown of the top platforms used by smart crypto trendspotters:Top tip: Don‚Äôt just use one tool. Great traders cross-reference everything.Crypto trend analysis 2025A coin might be flying, but is it because people are actually using it or just talking about it? Learning to tell the difference can save you from making a bad investment.¬†Signs of real tractionSteady user growth and TVL over time: If users are showing up before a token pumps ‚Äî and the numbers keep climbing week over week ‚Äî that‚Äôs usually a sign of substance. You‚Äôll often see this in DeFi protocols or layer 2s gaining trust slowly, not overnight.Code commits and product updates: A live GitHub with regular commits, active devs and visible progress means the team is building. This shows momentum and long-term focus ‚Äî not just a marketing push.More tokenholders, less whale control: When new holders join steadily ‚Äî and supply isn‚Äôt all locked up by the top five wallets ‚Äî it‚Äôs a healthier setup. Distributed ownership reduces the risk of rug pulls or coordinated dumps.New integrations and ecosystem activity: If other apps are integrating the token or building on the protocol, it usually means the tech is solid and useful. This kind of network effect compounds fast and often precedes a breakout.Liquidity that builds slowly: Gradual increases in liquidity and trading volume tend to reflect real interest. If liquidity sticks around (rather than vanishing after a pump), it‚Äôs usually organic.Signs of manufactured hypeSudden spikes in social mentions or trading volume with no news: If the project is everywhere on X overnight, but there‚Äôs no product update, launch or roadmap shift, be skeptical. It‚Äôs likely a coordinated shill.Influencer spam and recycled talking points: When you see multiple anonymous influencers posting the same meme or catchphrase, that‚Äôs a signal someone‚Äôs trying to manufacture buzz.No dev activity or roadmap: If there‚Äôs no GitHub, no changelog and the team isn‚Äôt shipping anything, it‚Äôs probably just a hype machine.Anonymous team, outrageous promises: Combine a mystery team with claims like ‚Äú100x guaranteed,‚Äù and you‚Äôre likely looking at a cash grab. Real builders let the work speak for itself.Rule of thumb: If the price is moving and everything else ‚Äî users, devs, integrations ‚Äî is standing still, you‚Äôre looking at hype. But when those fundamentals are quietly ticking up in the background? That‚Äôs when it‚Äôs worth a closer look.More red flagsSome projects look great on the surface ‚Äî slick websites, trending hashtags, a fast-moving chart ‚Äî but fall apart under the hood. Here are some more red flags to watch out for:High holder concentration: If most of the token is sitting in a handful of wallets, it doesn‚Äôt take much for a price crash. Whales often buy early and dump on retail.Unverified token contracts: A token that hasn‚Äôt been verified on Etherscan or BscScan might hide functions that allow minting, blocking wallets or draining liquidity. Always check the contract or look for an audit.No liquidity lock or audit: If the devs control all the liquidity provider tokens and there‚Äôs no lock or time-locked contract, they can pull the rug at any moment. Similarly, no third-party audit? That‚Äôs a gamble.Big token unlocks coming up: Large unlocks for insiders or early investors can trigger huge sell-offs. If you‚Äôre holding during a major vesting event, you could be exit liquidity. Know the schedule.Top tip: Before you click buy, ask, Who stands to gain the most if this pumps? Who gets hurt if it dumps? If the answer points to a few insiders with heavy bags and zero accountability, walk away.How to spot crypto trends before the crowdThe best early investors are the mechanics looking under the hood. They study token structures and unlock schedules, join communities early to catch signals firsthand, and follow the builders to see who‚Äôs actually shipping.¬†Most importantly, they cross-check everything: on-chain data, social sentiment, developer activity, and liquidity. Tools like Dune, DefiLlama, Nansen and GitHub help them separate noise from substance ‚Äî and spot winners before the crowd does.Crypto rewards those who are curious, critical and a little bit contrarian. The crowd usually shows up late. If you want to find gems before they moon, you‚Äôll need to think independently, dig deeper, and act before the narrative forms.It‚Äôs not easy. But it‚Äôs doable. And the more you practice spotting early signals ‚Äî the real ones, not the noise ‚Äî the more second nature it becomes.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-22T15:00:00.000Z,"Semiconductor exemptions don‚Äôt matter when it comes to tariffs","Opinion by: Ahmad Shadid of O.xyzSemiconductors scored a rare exemption from US President Donald Trump‚Äôs aggressive reciprocal tariffs, but the relief is symbolic at best. Most semiconductors enter the US embedded in servers, GPUs, laptops, and smartphones.¬†The finished goods remain heavily tariffed, some with duties reaching up to 49%. The exemption looks good politically but delivers little practical benefit. Nvidia‚Äôs DGX systems, crucial for training advanced AI models, do not fall under the exempted HTS codes. Nvidia could pay effective tariffs nearing 40% on these vital components. Such costs threaten to stall critical AI infrastructure projects across the country.¬†Semiconductor tariffs may compromise the goal of the CHIPS Act. The act promised tens of billions of dollars in subsidies to support domestic chip manufacturing. Yet advanced lithography machines ‚Äî key equipment from countries like the Netherlands and Japan ‚Äî face 20%‚Äì24% tariffs. Ironically, tariffs designed to boost American production increase the cost of essential manufacturing equipment.The effect of new tariffs is already slowing progress in critical supply chains ‚Äî just as generative AI and large language models are gaining momentum across sectors like finance and defense. Any delays or cost increases now could blunt America‚Äôs technological advantage.Indirect costs undermine exemptions for AIModern semiconductor supply chains are global and highly integrated. An exemption on raw silicon means nothing when servers, GPUs and other finished products face steep tariffs. Tariffs indirectly inflate costs, eliminating any competitive advantage from domestic manufacturing.Indirect tariff costs hit high-end systems disproportionately hard. The effect ripples through AI model training, data center expansions and major infrastructure projects, significantly slowing the industry‚Äôs momentum.Tariff impasse halts investmentSo far, it‚Äôs clear that the US president‚Äôs tariff plan didn‚Äôt follow any conventional economic trends or calculated strategy. The uncertain tariff situation stalls investment decisions across the technology sector. Companies need predictable costs to justify large capital expenditures. Ongoing tariff volatility prevents them from committing resources to new data centers and manufacturing lines.This mirrors the supply chain chaos of 2020. At that time, uncertainty caused massive order cancellations and slowed industry recovery for years. If tariff ambiguity continues, we could see similar waves of cancellations in 2025. This would further compound existing inventory and revenue issues in the semiconductor sector.Domestic production is not optimalThe border argument for these tariffs is that they‚Äôre meant to boost domestic production. They do little, however, to encourage genuine domestic semiconductor production. Despite subsidies under the CHIPS Act, most US semiconductor companies still rely on international foundries for manufacturing. Instead, they face increased equipment and operational costs.Recent: How trade wars impact stocks and cryptoThe idea that tariffs promote domestic production ignores the reality of global semiconductor manufacturing. Costs rise across the board, putting American companies at a disadvantage rather than offering protection.AI projects face heightened riskThe blockchain and crypto sectors, particularly AI-driven projects, also feel the pinch. Projects depend heavily on GPUs and high-performance servers for mining, validating transactions and running decentralized AI computations. Increased hardware costs directly affect profitability and growth, potentially stalling innovation in blockchain applications.¬†AI developments have just started to pick up the pace in the blockchain and Web3 space. The industry saw increased interest from investors and VCs just a year ago. So, they are still on tighter budgets. Elevated costs can, however, lead to stagnation. We might see innovators and developers exiting the market. The ripple effect extends beyond the general technology sector and could threaten future digital economies.¬†Moreover, these cost pressures disproportionately affect startups and smaller tech firms. Industry giants can absorb additional expenses, but innovative, smaller players face existential threats. This dynamic risks stifling innovation at the grassroots level, harming the entire tech ecosystem.What to expect¬†Semiconductors have momentarily escaped direct tariffs, but the exemption provides little benefit. Tariffs continue to hit finished products, driving up indirect costs across the industry. Instead of boosting domestic manufacturing, these tariffs create economic paralysis, stall critical infrastructure projects, and threaten America‚Äôs lead in AI innovation. Policymakers must acknowledge these realities and adjust their approach before irreversible damage is done to the nation‚Äôs technological future.Opinion by: Ahmad Shadid of O.xyz.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

That‚Äôs the promise of staking, a mechanism that powers many modern blockchains by turning users into network operators.¬†In this week‚Äôs episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Gareth Jenkinson and Nathan Jeffay sit down with StarkWare‚Äôs Noam Nisan to unpack how this trustless engine works, why it matters and what‚Äôs really at stake.Understanding stakingJeffay began by highlighting how staking is part of the backbone that keeps the blockchain running, and runs itself, with volunteers.‚ÄúBy doing this, they‚Äôre saying, OK, we‚Äôre taking this task of running the blockchain seriously. Here's some of our money. We're putting it down. We're showing that we're serious about doing this.‚ÄùTo help unpack this topic further and examine the deeper mechanics behind staking, the hosts are joined by Noam Nisan, principal researcher at StarkWare and a widely respected computer scientist who has held roles at Google and Princeton.Related: How to handle crypto trading gains and losses on your balance sheet‚ÄúSo we have this general system with operators... Why would they want to do that? The system, the protocol, incentivizes them to actually run the system,‚Äù Nisan explained. ‚ÄúBasically, it can give them tokens for operating the system.‚ÄùStaking offers what Nisan describes as two distinct types of security: computer science-based guarantees and economic disincentives for bad actors.¬†‚ÄúIf a majority or supermajority, maybe two-thirds of the parties of the token of the staked amount are behaving properly... we can prove that the system acts correctly,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut you also have what I would call an economic guarantee... if they destroy the system, very likely the value of the token... will go down.

2025-05-22T12:38:44.000Z,"UK court partially dismisses Bitcoin SV investor‚Äôs lawsuit against Binance","The United Kingdom‚Äôs Court of Appeal has partially dismissed a lawsuit brought by Bitcoin SV investors against major crypto exchanges, including Binance, for allegedly conspiring to delist the token in 2019.In a judgment handed down on May 21, the court ruled that investors who held BSV through the delisting period (classified as ‚Äúsub-class B‚Äù) were not entitled to billions in speculative damages based on BSV‚Äôs hypothetical growth.These investors had claimed over 8.9 billion British pounds ($11.9 billion) in damages, asserting that Binance‚Äôs delisting deprived holders of the chance to profit from BSV‚Äôs potential rise to a ‚Äútop-tier cryptocurrency‚Äù like Bitcoin (BTC) or Bitcoin Cash (BCH).The court rejected this ‚Äúforegone growth effect‚Äù theory, stating, ‚ÄúBSV was obviously not a unique cryptocurrency without reasonably similar substitutes,‚Äù pointing to the representative‚Äôs own use of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash as comparators.Sub-class B‚Äôs central claim was that delisting led to a missed opportunity to benefit from price appreciation. However, the court determined that those investors had ample chance to mitigate losses by selling or reinvesting in other crypto assets.‚ÄúThey had a duty to mitigate their losses,‚Äù wrote Master of the Rolls Sir Geoffrey Vos. ‚ÄúThey cannot recover losses that they could reasonably have mitigated.‚ÄùUK court ruling against Bitcoin SV investor‚Äôs lawsuit.

The court ruled it ‚Äúflawed as a matter of principle,‚Äù noting that ‚Äúcryptocurrencies are, by their nature, volatile investments.‚ÄùBinance‚Äôs limited strike-out application ultimately succeeded, with the court stating that even if some holders were unaware of the delisting, ‚Äúthey could never claim more than the total value of their holding before the delisting events plus any quantifiable consequential losses.‚ÄùRelated: Binance wants arbitration for all members of securities class suitBinance seeks to dismiss FTX lawsuitOn May 16, Binance filed a motion to dismiss a $1.76 billion lawsuit filed by the FTX estate, arguing that the claims are legally flawed and an attempt to shift responsibility for FTX‚Äôs collapse.The exchange stated the downfall of FTX stemmed from internal fraud, not external manipulation, citing Sam Bankman-Fried‚Äôs conviction on multiple fraud charges.Binance has asked the court to dismiss all claims with prejudice.

2025-05-22T10:21:18.000Z,"Can ChatGPT-powered AI agents really trade crypto for you?","Key takeawaysChatGPT-powered AI agents automate trading tasks using natural language prompts and API integrations, improving speed and consistency.Successes occur when ChatGPT is used as a support tool, not a fully autonomous trading system.Failures happen when traders over-rely on ChatGPT without real-time data, proper risk management or manual oversight.Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance.What if a crypto trader didn‚Äôt need to constantly check charts, worry about emotions, or stay up all night watching for sudden price swings? What if those tasks could be handled by an intelligent agent that understands instructions in plain English ‚Äî and reacts within milliseconds? That‚Äôs where ChatGPT-powered AI agents come in.These tools combine natural language processing with real-time trading logic to automate decision-making in one of the world‚Äôs most volatile markets. From rebalancing portfolios to reacting to market sentiment, ChatGPT is being adapted to act as a trading assistant, risk manager and market analyst ‚Äî all rolled into one.¬†But can it truly match or even outperform human intuition? This article explores how far these agents have come, where they shine and where they still fall short.How ChatGPT-powered AI agents operate in cryptocurrency marketsChatGPT-powered AI agents are changing how people interact with crypto markets. These tools combine ChatGPT‚Äôs language abilities with external trading tools and APIs to help users monitor prices, understand trends and even place trades automatically. Instead of just reacting to charts or numbers, ChatGPT can understand plain language commands like ‚ÄúBuy Ethereum if the price drops below $2,000‚Äù or ‚ÄúSell Bitcoin if RSI goes above 70.‚ÄùThese AI trading assistants can work with major platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, OKX and other centralized or decentralized exchanges and can also tap into decentralized finance (DeFi) tools and smart contracts. With the right setup, ChatGPT can help automate trading strategies based on both technical data and market news.Success stories vs. failures in ChatGPT-powered crypto tradingSome traders have used ChatGPT to assist in automating parts of their crypto trading processes, particularly for strategy generation and sentiment analysis. For example, a user shared on Reddit that they used a ChatGPT-based AI agent for technical analysis on Ether (ETH), feeding it four-hour and daily chart screenshots. By interpreting market sentiment, support and resistance zones, and other indicators, they managed to make $6,500 in profits.Similarly, in the broader crypto sector, ChatGPT has been applied to support project development activities such as drafting white papers and marketing content. A notable example is the launch of the ‚ÄúTURBO‚Äù memecoin, which reportedly reached a market capitalization of over $50 million in 2024. In this case, ChatGPT was used to streamline documentation and communication rather than manage trading activity, illustrating its usefulness as a support tool in crypto-related initiatives.However, limitations are evident when ChatGPT is applied beyond its core design. While ChatGPT could suggest a trading portfolio and explain its reasoning clearly, it lacks access to real-time market data and couldn‚Äôt respond to sudden volatility. In one instance, ChatGPT was allocated $100 across multiple tokens but failed to actively manage the portfolio as prices fluctuated. This resulted in missed opportunities and underperformance compared to dynamic algorithmic strategies.Individual experiences reinforce these observations. A Redditor exposed a scam where a YouTuber promoted a ‚ÄúChatGPT trading bot‚Äù tutorial that led users to deploy malicious smart contracts. The contracts, generated using ChatGPT and passed off as safe, were designed to drain user wallets once funded. Victims collectively lost $17,240 in ETH, highlighting the danger of blindly trusting AI-generated code without proper auditing.Even when asked, ‚ÄúIf I use ChatGPT to build an AI agent for crypto trading, can I become a millionaire?‚Äù ChatGPT responded with a realistic outlook ‚Äî acknowledging that while it‚Äôs possible, success depends on having a profitable strategy, disciplined risk management, and the ability to scale effectively.Here is ChatGPT‚Äôs response:These cases suggest that while ChatGPT can support certain elements of the trading process, it should not be treated as a standalone solution for autonomous crypto trading.AI in crypto trading: Key benefits and limitationsAI tools like ChatGPT are increasingly being integrated into crypto trading workflows to improve speed, accuracy and efficiency. While they offer important advantages, they also carry specific limitations that traders must actively manage. Below are the main benefits and challenges:Key benefits of using AI for crypto tradingAI bots can execute trades in milliseconds, crucial for capturing opportunities in fast-moving crypto markets.Bots follow pre-programmed rules precisely, eliminating emotional biases that often affect human traders.Crypto markets are always open, and AI bots can monitor and act around the clock without interruption.A single bot can manage multiple trading pairs, exchanges and strategies simultaneously.ChatGPT can understand specific prompts like ‚ÄúRebalance every Monday‚Äù or ‚ÄúSet stop-loss at 5%,‚Äù allowing flexible automation.Limitations of ChatGPT in cryptocurrency tradingChatGPT does not access live market data unless specifically integrated with external APIs (e.g., TradingView, CoinMarketCap or exchange websockets).Instructions must be clear and unambiguous; ChatGPT may misinterpret vague or complex commands.Improperly secured API keys or lack of two-factor authentication (2FA) can expose trading accounts to unauthorized access.ChatGPT‚Äôs cloud-based infrastructure can introduce latency, which could impact performance during highly volatile periods.ChatGPT does not monitor regional compliance rules; users must manually enforce trading limits based on local regulations.Ethical and regulatory implications of AI in crypto tradingAs AI becomes more integrated into trading systems, it raises significant ethical and regulatory concerns that stakeholders across the financial sector are beginning to address.Accountability: If an AI agent executes a harmful or unlawful trade, questions arise around legal responsibility. It remains unclear in many jurisdictions whether liability falls primarily on the developer, the trader using the AI system or the platform facilitating the transactions.Market manipulation risks: Autonomous AI bots could unintentionally engage in activities such as spoofing (placing and canceling fake orders to mislead the market) or wash trading (creating artificial volume), especially if not properly programmed with compliance safeguards.Regulatory oversight: Financial authorities, including the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the European Securities and Markets Authority, are actively studying the implications of AI and algorithmic trading. These agencies have recognized that traditional trading regulations may not fully account for autonomous decision-making by AI systems.Policy developments: In January 2024, the European Commission released updates to its Digital Finance Strategy, which included references to AI-based financial services. While not yet finalized, these draft regulations under the broader Digital Finance Package signal a move toward stricter compliance expectations for firms deploying AI in financial markets.Meanwhile, ethical crypto platforms are beginning to voluntarily disclose the use of trading bots in their systems. In parallel, open-source communities are advocating for clearer audit trails, improved model transparency and the establishment of ethical guidelines for AI applications in finance to ensure accountability and fairness.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The regulator gave market participants until June 19 to comply with the new rules.¬†The regulator previously told Cointelegraph that it had enhanced supervisory mechanisms and brought consistency across activity-based rules. One of the more prominent changes includes regulatory clarity on RWA tokens.¬†Irina Heaver, partner at the United Arab Emirates-based law firm NeosLegal, told Cointelegraph that the updated rules clarify RWA issuance and distribution.¬†‚ÄúIssuing real-world asset tokens and listing them on secondary markets is no longer theoretical,‚Äù Heaver told Cointelegraph. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs now a regulatory reality in Dubai and the broader UAE.‚ÄùA ‚Äúviable‚Äù path to realize RWA hypeHeaver compared RWAs to security token offerings (STOs), an earlier attempt from the crypto space to tokenize securities like stocks, bonds and real estate investment trusts. However, the UAE crypto lawyer said that STOs ‚Äúdied a peaceful death in 2018 to 2019.‚Äù¬†The lawyer told Cointelegraph STOs did not work out because of the lack of regulatory clarity, viable secondary market trading venues, institutional investor appetite and liquidity.¬†Still, the situation is different for RWAs. Heaver told Cointelegraph that RWAs are the next foundational layer for institutional adoption of blockchain and virtual assets. Heaver said that VARA‚Äôs new rules already cover them as Asset-Referenced Virtual Assets (ARVA) tokens. She said:¬†‚ÄúVARA‚Äôs newly updated Virtual Asset Issuance Rulebook (May 2025) addresses these failures head-on. Regulated exchanges and broker-dealers in Dubai are now authorized to distribute and list ARVA tokens.‚ÄùThe lawyer said this solves an issue in jurisdictions like Switzerland, where token issuance is possible, but listing and secondary trading remain unregulated.¬†Related: Dubai gov‚Äôt agencies to link real estate registry with property tokenizationLawyer shares requirements for RWA issuersHeaver said ARVA tokens are defined under Dubai law as representing direct or indirect ownership of real-world assets, granting entitlement to receive or share income and purporting to maintain a stable value by reference to real-world assets or income.¬†ARVA tokens are also backed or collateralised by such real-world assets or constitute a derivative, wrapped, duplicated, or fractionalised version of another ARVA.¬†The lawyer said issuers must meet specific requirements, including a Category 1 Virtual Asset Issuance license, a comprehensive white paper and a risk disclosure statement.¬†In addition, issuers must have a paid-up capital of 1.5 million UAE dirhams (about $408,000) or 2% of reserve assets held. The issuers are also subjected to monthly independent audit obligations and must adhere to ongoing supervisory oversight.¬†‚ÄúVARA is providing regulatory clarity, and it‚Äôs giving the industry a viable, enforceable path to turn the hype of RWA tokenization into reality,‚Äù Heaver told Cointelegraph. ‚ÄúThis matters because it marks a shift, from theory to execution, from fiction to framework.‚ÄùMagazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/dubai-vara-guidelines-rwa-tokenization-clarity?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-22T08:25:00.000Z,"5 red flags you‚Äôre being shilled: Don‚Äôt buy the hype","What is shilling in crypto?              At its core, shilling is the act of artificially promoting a cryptocurrency or token, often with exaggerated claims, to increase its price or popularity.¬†But what‚Äôs the goal?¬†Hype it up, get others to buy in, and then cash out, leaving latecomers holding the bag.Shilling can come from anyone: influencers, anonymous accounts or even high-profile figures with political or financial clout. The common thread is manipulation: It‚Äôs not about educating you or building real value but pumping hype for personal gain.Unfortunately, the line between enthusiastic promotion and outright deception can be thin, and many fall victim without realizing it. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs critical to learn how to spot the signs early.                  5 red flags you‚Äôre being shilled              Beware of crypto red flags like overhyped promises, anonymous teams, influencer shills, missing products and FOMO tactics ‚Äî if it smells like a scam, it probably is.1. Overhyped promises¬†You‚Äôve probably seen posts that scream:‚Äú100x potential!‚Äù‚ÄúGuaranteed returns!‚Äù‚ÄúThis is your ticket to financial freedom!‚ÄùThese are classic shill tactics. Real, credible projects don‚Äôt promise life-changing profits. Why? Because there are no guarantees in crypto or in any investment.When a project leads with grandiose financial claims rather than actual product value or utility, it‚Äôs likely a ploy to stir FOMO and attract unsuspecting investors. The truth is, if something sounds too good to be true, it almost always is.Remember: The bigger the promise, the bigger the red flag.2. Anonymous or suspicious teams¬†In crypto, anonymity isn‚Äôt always bad, but when you‚Äôre trusting people with your money, transparency matters.It‚Äôs a major red flag when a project has:No identifiable team membersFake names or aliasesStock photos on its websiteNo LinkedIn or professional history.The simple rule is ‚ÄúNo face, no funds.‚ÄùScammers often hide behind anonymity because they know they‚Äôll eventually vanish and there‚Äôll be no one to hold accountable. Even worse, some use fabricated credentials or hire actors to pose as team members.Before investing, check whether the founders or developers have any verifiable history. Do they have prior experience in blockchain or startups? Have they launched anything successful before?3. Influencer spam and paid promotions¬†One day, no one‚Äôs talking about a particular coin ‚Äî the next, your feed is flooded with influencers hyping it up. Sound familiar?This sudden burst of attention is often coordinated with a paid promotion campaign disguised as ‚Äúgenuine enthusiasm.‚ÄùMany influencers fail to disclose sponsorships, even though it‚Äôs required by law in many countries. The US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have cracked down on this in recent years.Take, for example:Kim Kardashian, who was fined $1.26 million in 2022 for promoting EthereumMax without proper disclosure.Floyd Mayweather Jr., who was sued for endorsing the same project at a paid event.BitBoy (Ben Armstrong), who faced legal action in multiple lawsuits for promoting scam tokens to his audience.If you notice multiple influencers promoting the same project in a short time, especially without using labels like #ad or #sponsored, it‚Äôs a strong indicator of a shill campaign.Don‚Äôt mistake volume for value. Hype doesn‚Äôt equal legitimacy.4. No real product or roadmapIf you visit the project‚Äôs website, it looks sleek, maybe even impressive. But where‚Äôs the product? Where‚Äôs the code?Shilled tokens often rely on flashy marketing but have no working application, no GitHub code and no actual use case. Everything is either ‚Äúcoming soon‚Äù or buried behind vague promises.Ask yourself:Can I use the platform or app today?Is there a white paper that makes sense?Do they have public repositories or open development?If all you‚Äôre seeing is a landing page and a vague roadmap that‚Äôs been ‚Äúcoming soon‚Äù for months, that‚Äôs a major red flag.5. Pressure tactics and FOMO¬†Time pressure is a psychological weapon, and shillers know how to use it.Watch out for lines such as:‚ÄúPresale ends in 2 hours!‚Äù‚ÄúOnly 1,000 spots left!‚Äù‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt buy now, you‚Äôll miss out forever!‚ÄùThese tactics prey on your fear of missing out (FOMO) and push you into making impulsive decisions without research.But crypto isn‚Äôt a sprint; it‚Äôs a long-term game. Anyone trying to rush you into buying likely has something to hide. Solid investments don‚Äôt need fake urgency.Take a breath, step back, and ask yourself: Am I buying because I believe in this project or because I‚Äôm being manipulated?Did you know? The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) secured a $128-million judgment against Ryan Mitchell Pope, Daniel Samuel Bishop and their company EmpiresX for operating a fraudulent forex and cryptocurrency investment scheme that defrauded over 12,500 victims.                  Is shilling illegal in crypto? Can influencers be sued?              Shilling isn‚Äôt just unethical in many cases ‚Äî it‚Äôs also illegal.In the world of crypto, undisclosed promotions are a major legal risk. If someone is paid to promote a token or project but fails to reveal that financial connection, they could face fines, lawsuits or even criminal charges. This is especially true if the promoted token is later classified as a security under US law.Regulators like the SEC, FTC and CFTC have all cracked down on this behavior.¬†Their targets have included:Influencers who failed to disclose paid promotionsPromoters who misled investors with false claimsIndividuals who ran pump-and-dump schemes using social media.Francier Obando Pinillo, a pastor from Miami, was indicted on 26 fraud counts for running a crypto scam through ‚ÄúSolano Fi,‚Äù defrauding investors of millions from 2021 to 2023. He allegedly used his church, social media and false promises of 34.9% monthly returns to lure victims. The platform showed fake gains but blocked withdrawals, while funds were diverted for personal use. Pinillo was arraigned in Richland, Washington and faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.As crypto becomes more mainstream, expect stricter regulations and more consequences for shillers.Did you know? Argentine President Javier Milei has dissolved the special task force investigating the LIBRA cryptocurrency scandal, a project he promoted in February 2025 that surged to a $4.5-billion valuation before crashing by over 97%. The task force, created by Milei himself, was disbanded via Decree 332/2025, citing that it had fulfilled its purpose. However, critics argue that no official findings were released, and judicial investigations into Milei and his associates continue.                  How to protect yourself from shilling scams              Do your own research, verify the team and utility, ignore hype and influencers, and stay alert to pump-and-dump schemes to avoid crypto shilling traps.Let‚Äôs understand how you can protect yourself from shilling scams in crypto:Do your own research (DYOR): Always research the project, the team behind it and the data supporting the claims. Don‚Äôt rely solely on hype or influencer recommendations. Look into onchain data, GitHub activity and the project‚Äôs utility to make informed decisions.Verify the team: A legitimate crypto project should have a transparent and credible team. If the developers are anonymous or have no professional profiles (like LinkedIn), that‚Äôs a red flag. Always check the team‚Äôs past projects and credibility before investing.Look for real utility: Does this project actually solve a problem? A genuine project should have a working product or solution, not just promises. Avoid projects that lack real-world utility or are still in ‚Äúcoming soon‚Äù stages for extended periods.Ignore the hype: If a token is suddenly trending on social media or being aggressively promoted, don‚Äôt let FOMO influence your judgment. Shillers often rely on emotions to push their agenda, so it‚Äôs essential to evaluate projects based on their merits, not just popularity.Stay skeptical of influencers: Influencers with large followings may be paid to promote certain tokens. Before taking their advice, ask yourself, What‚Äôs their incentive? Verify the promotion is legitimate and disclosed as paid or sponsored. Always cross-check the information with independent sources.Watch for pump-and-dump schemes: Be cautious of sudden price spikes followed by rapid drops. These are often signs of pump-and-dump schemes where the token‚Äôs value is artificially inflated by coordinated buying and then quickly sold off, leaving investors with losses. Always monitor price trends and be wary of sudden, unexplained increases in value.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/5-red-flags-youre-being-shilled-dont-buy-the-hype?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
