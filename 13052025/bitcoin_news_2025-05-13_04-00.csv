After that, the reward rate will be set to 0% APY.The stablecoin issuer’s customers can redeem their USDM through the firm’s platform, while other USDM holders are encouraged to swap the stablecoin for other tokens on exchanges.Related: ‘Dark stablecoins’ could emerge as regulations tightenMountain Protocol’s Ethereum-based USDM is not to be confused with Mehen Finance’s USDM stablecoin, which runs on the Cardano network. Mountain Protocol’s USDM saw considerable success shortly after launching in late 2023, rising to a $155 million market cap by March 2024, according to RWA.xyz. However, its market cap has since fallen below $50 million.RWA.xyz estimates there are around 10,820 USDM holders.Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/anchorage-digital-acquires-stablecoin-issuer-mountain-protocol?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

A bullish MACD crossover has traders predicting a 180% rally, with targets at $0.65 and $1.Dogecoin's (DOGE) price rallied in lockstep with Ethereum over the past 7 days, gaining 38% in May, which is its strongest monthly performance this year. According to CoinGecko, DOGE recorded $4.7 billion in trading volume over the past 24 hours, ranking fifth among the top cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins). The memecoin’s market strength has been coupled with strong onchain insights. Data from CryptoQuant noted that DOGE’s spot taker 90-day cumulative volume delta (CVD), which measures the net difference between buying and selling volume over 90 days, has been \""taker buyer dominant.” It indicates more aggressive buying than selling, a pattern last seen in November 2024, leading to DOGE’s breakout rally of 385% to $0.48 in Q4, 2024. DOGE spot taker CVD. Source: CryptoQuantSimilarly, the long-term holder net unrealized profit/loss (NUPL), which tracks unrealized profits or losses for DOGE holders with a lifespan of at least 155 days, recently crossed 0.5 for the first time since March 1, 2025, turning to optimistic or “belief” sentiment. A NUPL above 0.5 means most holders are in profit, signaling confidence and a reduced likelihood of selling. This optimism reinforces price stability, as holders could refrain from selling and hold out for higher gains. The above metrics suggest strong market demand, with investors actively accumulating Dogecoin, which likely contributed to its recent gains. DOGE long-term holder NUPL.

As illustrated in the chart, each bullish crossover has been followed by a breakout, with prices jumping 180% between January 2024 and March 2024, and a whopping 385% between September 2024 and December 2024.  Dogecoin weekly analysis.

Instead, the Commission will utilize its existing rulemaking, interpretive, and exemptive authorities to set fit-for-purpose standards for market participants.”Source: U.S. Securities and Exchange CommissionA key priority will be to “develop a rational regulatory framework for crypto asset markets that establishes clear rules of the road for the issuance, custody, and trading of crypto assets while continuing to discourage bad actors from violating the law.”In particular, Atkins said the SEC would focus on establishing “clear and sensible guidelines” for crypto assets that could be considered securities. Another area of focus would be to allow brokers to offer a broader range of investment products on their platforms, which in some cases may mix securities and non-securities.Atkins’ approach moves away from former SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s, whose tenure was criticized by some industry participants for its “regulation by enforcement” method of oversight.Securities evolutionAtkins likened the tokenization of securities to the evolution of audio formats — from vinyl to cassettes to digital software — highlighting how each shift enhanced compatibility and interoperability across a wide range of devices and applications.

2025-05-12T19:50:58.000Z,"Bitcoin price sells off after Trump’s US-China tariff deal — Here is why","Key takeaways:Bitcoin lags as investors shift toward stocks after the US and China strike a deal that could end the current trade war.Macroeconomic conditions are swinging away from gold investing and back to stocks. Bitcoin (BTC) reached its highest price in over three months at $105,720 on May 12, but was unable to maintain its bullish momentum. Interestingly, the drop to $102,000 came after a temporary easing in the US-China tariff conflict. This has left traders puzzled as to why Bitcoin reacted negatively to what seemed like positive developments.The 90-day truce reduced import tariffs, and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted that the agreement could be extended, provided there is a genuine effort and constructive dialogue. According to Yahoo Finance, the topics under discussion include “currency manipulation,” “steel price dumping,” and restrictions on semiconductor exports.Bitcoin/USD (orange) vs. S&P 500 futures (red) and gold (blue). Source: TradingView / CointelegraphPart of Bitcoin’s recent lack of momentum can be attributed to its 24% gains over the previous 30 days, during which S&P 500 futures rose 7% and gold remained flat. Investors see little reason for further divergence between Bitcoin and traditional markets, especially since the 30-day correlation with the stock market remains high at 83%. Additionally, Bitcoin has now surpassed the market capitalization of both silver and Google, making it the world’s sixth-largest tradable asset.World’s largest tradable assets, USD. Source: 8marketcapNews that Strategy acquired another 13,390 BTC between May 5 and May 11 has also raised concerns among investors. With BlackRock and Strategy together holding 1.19 million BTC, about 6% of the circulating supply, some traders worry that Michael Saylor’s company is largely responsible for supporting the price.Critics, such as Peter Schiff, predict that Strategy’s ever-increasing average purchase price could eventually lead to losses and force the company to sell some of its holdings to cover borrowing costs. However, this scenario seems unlikely, as the company has doubled its capital increase limit by $21 billion in stocks and another $21 billion in debt.Bitcoin stalls as macroeconomic events favor stocks over goldWhile traders often focus on Bitcoin-specific events, the most likely reason for the weakness near $105,000 is broader macroeconomic conditions. Although the pause in tariffs directly benefits the stock market, the effect on scarce assets like Bitcoin is somewhat negative. For example, gold fell 3.4% on May 12 as the demand for safe-haven assets declined.Gold/USD (left) vs. DXY US Dollar Index (right). Source: TradingView / CointelegraphGold has typically shown an inverse correlation with the US Dollar Index (DXY), which climbed to its highest level in 30 days on May 12. The strengthening US dollar signals investor confidence, despite a 0.3% decline in US first-quarter Gross Domestic Product and a 6.1% jump in pending home sales in March compared to the previous month.Related: Bitcoin short-term ‘technical sell-off’ under $100K possible ahead of May 13 CPI printThe lack of conviction among Bitcoin investors when prices traded near $105,000 is at least partly due to reduced demand for scarce assets, as investors view the stock market as a more immediate and direct beneficiary of the US-China trade deal. Lower import duties suggest higher revenues and potentially improved profit margins for companies.Given the impressive $2 billion in inflows into US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) between May 1 and May 9, the likelihood of a price drop below $100,000 remains low. The steady demand for Bitcoin following a 24% monthly gain points to institutional adoption rather than retail-driven FOMO, which is a very positive sign for the price.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The revised version addressed potential risks to the integrity of the Bitcoin network posed by quantum computing, the filing shows.“[I]f quantum computing technology is able to advance […] it could potentially undermine the viability of many of the cryptographic algorithms used across the world’s information technology infrastructure, including the cryptographic algorithms used for digital assets like bitcoin,” BlackRock said.

Bitcoin market structure and qualitative fundamentals remain bullish, suggesting today’s correction could be short-lived.Bitcoin (BTC) price briefly stumbled on May 12, falling to $102,388 after hitting an intraday high at $105,819 during the US trading session. At first glance, the abrupt correction seemed unexpected given the positive news of the day. Since Sunday evening (May 11), mainstream media headlines have reported on the positive headway made in the US-China trade talks occurring in Switzerland, and throughout the evening, President Trump ran his victory lab via Truth Social posts heralding the positives of the deal. BREAKING: U.S. Announces China Trade Deal in Geneva pic.twitter.com/JjgvYAvAGe— The White House (@WhiteHouse) May 11, 2025As news of the tentative deal broke, US equity futures markets soared, and these gains materialized into a 1,000-point rally in the Dow at the opening bell. Looking beyond the temporary resolution of the US-China trade war, Bitcoin has racked up back-to-back wins over the past two weeks. On May 12, Strategy CEO Michael Saylor announced that the company had acquired 13,390 Bitcoin, bringing its total balance to 568,840 BTC. On the same day, shares of healthcare company KindlyMD surged up to 600% after announcing the merger with Nakamoto Holdings, a Bitcoin investment company founded by David Bailey, who is Trump’s current crypto adviser. The month of April followed a similar trajectory to today, where frequent Bitcoin treasury creation announcements were made by an assortment of US-based and international companies. Related: US real estate asset manager launches $100M tokenized fund with institutional backingProfit taking and de-risking drive the current Bitcoin price correctionWhile Bitcoin's mass adoption appears to be accelerating, data from Glassnode suggests that BTC price could be in for a brief period of consolidation after gaining 9% in the last week. The onchain analytics firm posted the following chart and warned that: “BTC Supply Mapping shows sustained strength in new demand. First-Time Buyers RSI has held at 100 all week. But Momentum Buyers remain weak (RSI ~11), and Profit Takers are rising. If fresh inflows slow, lack of follow-through could lead to consolidation.” At major crypto exchanges, there was an uptick in selling in perpetual futures markets, and selling was also seen in spot markets as BTC price rallied into a sell wall near $106,000. From a trader's point of view, a portion of the selling could be possible derisking ahead of the May 13 Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation report, along with the view that the Trump trade deal with China is now priced in after BTC failed to rally and hold above $104,000 on such momentous news. BTC/USD spot and futures CVD. Source: TRDR.io Leading into the trade war news, the US Dollar Index (DXY) rallied and stock indexes soared. Seeing Bitcoin failing to break and hold $104,000 to $105,000 prior to stock futures opening and then BTC being unable to follow equities opening bell gains in the NY session suggests some traders elected to close profitable longs ahead of tomorrow’s CPI or before the current bid appetite shifts to lower price levels. BTC/USDT futures 1-hour chart.

2025-05-12T15:00:00.000Z,"Will Bitcoin hodlers be the reason more countries adopt wealth taxes?","Opinion by: Robin Singh, CEO of KoinlyIs there a catch for Bitcoin hodlers, with the asset’s price up over 600,000% since the beginning of 2013? Perhaps — if governments keep waking up to Bitcoin’s value, the whole “you only pay tax when you sell” mantra could soon be a thing of the past.What if a wealth tax is the answer for revenue-hungry tax agencies with no time to lose? It’s a yearly tax on a person’s total net worth — cash, investments, property and other assets — minus any debts, applied whether or not those assets are sold or generating income. The idea is to boost public revenue and curb inequality, mainly by taxing the ultra-rich. A wealth tax takes a clip off what you own, not what you earn.Countries such as Belgium, Norway and Switzerland have had wealth taxes baked into their tax systems for ages, yet some of the world’s biggest economies — like the US, Australia and France — have largely steered clear. That might be changing. More governments are eyeing wealth taxes for crypto. In December 2024, French Senator Sylvie Vermeillet took it a step further, suggesting Bitcoin (BTC) be labeled “unproductive,” which would mean taxing its gains every year — whether or not it’s ever sold. Yep, every asset holder’s favorite word is unrealized capital gains tax. It would be naive to assume other countries are not thinking about the same idea. With Bitcoin’s significant gains and industry executives such as ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood eyeing a $1.5-million price tag by 2030, I’d bet a magic 8-ball would say, “Signs point to yes.”The growing global interest in wealth taxIt might seem far-fetched, but it is hard to ignore the gains. The average long-term Bitcoin holder is already sitting on significant profits.The incentive is obvious. Switzerland’s wealth tax goes up to 1% of a portfolio’s value, and governments know there is plenty to collect.Countries catch on — sooner or later. Consider how capital gains tax became the norm.The US introduced capital gains tax in 1913, the UK jumped on board 52 years later in 1965, and Australia followed in 1985. Governments likely considering the wealth taxGovernments are likely entertaining the idea — whether they admit it or not. If any country seriously considers it, Germany could be a prime candidate, even though it scrapped its wealth tax back in 1997.Recent: Ukraine floats 23% tax on some crypto income, exemptions for stablecoinsIn July 2024, offloading 50,000 seized BTC at $58,000 might have seemed like a smart move for the German government, but when Bitcoin hit $100,000 just months later in December, it became clear they left a fortune on the table. In retrospect, a costly mistake…Will this be remembered as a blunder on par with Gordon Brown selling half of the UK’s gold reserves at $275 an ounce? Imposing such a rule on the wealthy comes with obvious risks.To understand the real effect of taxation on a country, just follow the money — specifically, where millionaires are moving. Recent data shows that high-net-worth individuals are leaving countries like the United Kingdom in droves, heading for tax-friendly havens like Dubai.The potential repercussions of a wealth taxWill nations risk losing these individuals to tap into unrealized gains on Bitcoin and other assets?Bitcoin is volatile and full of unknowns. While some events could lead to massive losses, governments may still push forward with policies that ultimately drive away millionaires, only to realize the trade-off wasn’t worth it. Conversely, US President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve — a clear nod to the hodl mentality. No doubt, this has other nations considering a similar move.If nations are embracing the hodl mindset, could that mean wealth taxes are off the table in those countries? Only time will tell.One thing is sure: Bitcoin hodlers have amassed enough wealth to put themselves on the radar of tax authorities. Whether this sparks fundamental policy changes or just political grandstanding, the crypto community won’t sit back quietly.Opinion by: Robin Singh, CEO of Koinly.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The researchers pointed out that geographical barriers have less influence on cryptocurrency transactions compared with traditional financial systems.Related: Spar supermarket in Switzerland starts accepting Bitcoin paymentsSpeculative crypto activity remains tied to “global conditions for funding in major crypto markets,” signaling a growing “interconnectedness” between cryptocurrencies and the legacy financial system, the researchers said, adding:“Concurrently, we observe that tighter global funding conditions, known to curtail risk-taking in traditional asset classes, are associated with reduced flows. This indicates increasing interconnectedness between cryptoassets as speculative assets and mainstream finance.”Additionally, crypto-specific risks and heightened public awareness significantly influence crypto investment flows, reinforcing their role as speculative assets, according to the BIS.The findings were published nearly a month after the BIS warned that the number of investors and amount of capital in crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi) had “reached a critical mass,” posing a threat to financial stability and global wealth inequality, Cointelegraph reported on April 19.Related: $400M Web3 investment fund ABCDE halts new investments, fundraisingStablecoin, low-value Bitcoin payments fueled by fiat inflation, high transfer costsBeyond speculative investment tools, stablecoins and Bitcoin are also used as a “transactional medium.”“Higher opportunity costs of fiat currency usage, such as high inflation, spur bilateral cross-border transactions in both unbacked cryptoassets and stablecoins,” the BIS stated, adding:“Likewise, greater economic activity within both sender and receiver countries is often linked to increased crypto flows in most cases.”High remittance fees charged by traditional financial institutions further bolster crypto adoption for international money transfers, especially from developed economies to emerging markets, the report stated.Global USDT flow map.

2025-05-12T11:18:00.000Z,"What is RISC-V, and why does Vitalik Buterin want it for Ethereum smart contracts?","What is RISC-V?              RISC-V, pronounced “risk five,” is a modern open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) based on reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles. In simple terms, it’s like a blueprint that defines a set of instructions that a processor can execute.RISC-V is designed to be highly modular, efficient and flexible. Originally developed by the University of California in 2010, the open-source framework gives developers the flexibility to tailor its functionality and use cases, plus offers cost savings compared to proprietary ISAs like ARM or x86. This offers a wide range of uses, from supercomputers to smartphones and now blockchains like Ethereum.On April 20, 2025, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin unveiled a “radical” new scaling proposal to replace the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) with the RISC-V instruction set architecture, aiming to boost the speed and efficiency of the network’s execution layer. The idea is that RISC-V is the best way to solve the blockchain’s scalability constraints. “It aims to greatly improve the efficiency of the Ethereum execution layer, resolving one of the primary scaling bottlenecks, and can also greatly improve the execution layer’s simplicity - in fact, it is perhaps the only way to do so.The idea: replace the EVM with RISC-V as the virtual machine language that smart contracts are written in,” said Buterin.Ethereum continues to face high transaction fees and reduced transaction volume as users shift to layer 2s for cheaper, faster transactions. This aligns with Ethereum’s scaling strategy post-Merge (2022). Buterin’s idea to reshape the chain is seen as a chance for it to modernize and retain its dominance as a top smart contracting platform.Did you know? Ethereum’s execution layer has become its main scalability bottleneck. The inefficient processing of smart contracts and transactions due to single-threaded execution, wasteful computational design and complex state management is causing network congestion.                  How would RISC-V work on Ethereum?              Adding RISC-V to Ethereum is still just a proposal being discussed by the community and network governance. Buterin outlines several approaches to implement the proposal, including running two virtual machines (VMs) or a complete switch to RISC-V.The first idea to support VMs would enable contracts to be written and executed in either the existing EVM model or RISC-V. Both contract types would have access to functionality such as persistent storage, holding Ether (ETH) balances and making and receiving calls. Adding to this, the contract could integrate so they can call one another. An alternative approach, described as “more radical,” would modify the protocol to convert existing EVM contracts. This would require rewriting current contracts to interact with an EVM interpreter, while new contracts would be written directly in RISC-V.A major challenge for such a drastic change is to avoid breaking existing decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts. Ethereum can’t risk breaking existing contracts written in the current EVM code. A transitional solution could involve using an interpreter — essentially a translation layer between different computing languages. This would allow developers to begin building with RISC-V while ensuring legacy EVM contracts continue to function without disruption.Did you know? In 2022, Ethereum made a leap forward in its energy efficiency and delivered more scalability, security and sustainability. In a process dubbed “The Merge,” the chain switched from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake (PoS). This involved merging the Ethereum mainnet with a separate PoS blockchain called Beacon Chain.                  Key benefits of RISC-V vs. EVM              If RISC-V causes a major shift in the Ethereum architecture, what will be the benefits of making this change? In the long run, RISC-V would enhance the Ethereum smart contracts’ performance and processing.According to Buterin, the new architecture could theoretically deliver efficiency gains of 100x; in reality, this number will be hard to reach, but gains would still be significant. The efficiency gains are tied to RISC-V’s suitability for both zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems and general smart contract execution, as it eliminates EVM overhead.It’s less about replacing the EVM outright and more about using RISC-V as a backend for zkEVM or similar ZK rollups, where proving costs dominate. Scalability improvements would largely come from offloading execution to ZK rollups, with RISC-V optimizing the proving process.RISC-V smart contracts could run faster and use fewer computational resources. This increased efficiency would likely translate to lower gas fees for the end users. In the process, it would also enable the network to handle more users and transactions without slowing down. That would be a direct improvement to the scalability of Ethereum, potentially solving one of the biggest criticized points of the blockchain industry. Additionally, RISC-V’s simple, flexible instruction set is better suited for ZK-proof computations than the EVM, which incurs overhead from administrative tasks like gas accounting and state management. Rather than rebuilding the EVM for ZK-proofs, RISC-V offers a streamlined alternative, simplifying the development of ZK-optimized execution layers. This could accelerate Ethereum’s roadmap for privacy and scalability via ZK rollups, making RISC-V a compelling complement to the EVM.Below is a comparison table summarizing the key differences and benefits of RISC-V vs. the EVM.Did you know? Ethereum has gone through several major development milestones over its first decade. Notably, in 2016, it conducted a hard fork to roll back the chain after The DAO hack. The result is still noticeable today with Ethereum and Ethereum Classic chains both in existence.                  Will RISC-V be implemented in the future?              Buterin’s proposal has sparked a lively debate among Ethereum users and developers. It is an ambitious idea that could be a milestone in the development roadmap for the leading smart contract blockchain. Programmer Ben Adams raised several concerns about the proposal: In short, the ZK-proof might become more efficient, but there could be a trade-off. Block building and execution, which run the smart contracts, could end up becoming significantly slower. “The risk here is that ZK-proving may get better, but block building and execution will deteriorate significantly,” commented Ben Adams.A sentiment that was echoed by another anonymous commenter, “I agree with Ben Adams here, The EVM as a whole is very much U256 based, so abstracting down to RISC-V would decrease overall execution performance.”Others appeared to agree that RISC-V was a good idea to help reduce bottlenecks but questioned if it was a priority, given the potential technical difficulty and cost. “Agree, it seems like a good idea for the L1 that solves points 2 and 3 of the L1 bottlenecks. But is this the set of priorities we want to solve for, especially given the scale of technical cost here?” added Adam Cochran. It’s clear that the proposal still needs clarity and further discussions within the Ethereum community. While the promise is one of radical simplification that drives efficiency and speed, it also introduces a complex technical change. It would require potentially years of dedication to rethinking how the layer-1 blockchain works.Of course, as with any decentralized project, the green light doesn’t just rely on technical planning; it needs the consent of the community. So, currently, Buterin’s proposal has opened a wide conversation about any impending development action.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-risc-v-and-why-does-vitalik-buterin-want-it-for-ethereum-smart-contracts?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Source: CryptoQuantThe post added that long-term holders — those hodling for at least six months — may see the return to six figures as a suitable opportunity to reduce BTC exposure. Newcomers and speculators, on the other hand, may only now be planning an entry.“With nearly all BTC holders in profit, distribution risk increases. Long-term holders may see these conditions as a signal to derisk, especially with BTC near all-time highs,” Kripto Mevsimi continued. “Meanwhile, newer entrants could interpret this strength as confirmation to chase, creating a potential sentiment mismatch.”Last week, research nonetheless suggested that buy-side and sell-side pressure was broadly balanced, with the implication that Bitcoin could continue moving higher without a significant rush to the exit.Mainstream retail ignores $104,000 BitcoinIn an interesting development — one potentially supporting sustained BTC price upside — the market is less “greedy” at $104,000 than it was when Bitcoin traded more than 10% lower.Related: Ethereum chart pattern supports ‘moon shot’ rally to new price highs if confirmed — TraderThe latest data from the Crypto Fear & Greed Index shows that while “greed” does characterize the general mood, the initial push to $94,000 on April 23 delivered higher readings.Fear & Greed measured 70/100 on May 12, while on April 23 it reached 72/100, just inches from “extreme greed” territory.Lower levels of greed in the face of higher prices could potentially signal more sustainable price growth as investors resist the urge to act erratically.Crypto Fear & Greed Index (screenshot).

Following the deployment, the upgrade failed to finalize on the network, leading the developers to investigate and address the issues. On March 5, Pectra was rolled out to the Sepolia testnet, but the developers encountered errors made worse by an attacker who caused the mining of empty blocks. To further prepare for the deployment, Ethereum core developers created a new testnet called “Hoodi” before deploying the upgrade to the mainnet on May 7. With the upgrade, externally owned accounts (EOAs) can act as smart contracts to cover gas fees and payments using tokens that are not ETH. In addition, validator staking limits were increased from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, simplifying operations for large stakers. The upgrade also increases the number of data blobs per block, allowing better scalability for layer-2 networks.Since the upgrade, ETH’s price has started to skyrocket.

2025-05-12T09:10:00.000Z,"What is social engineering in crypto (and how to protect yourself)?","Social engineering in crypto, explained              In the world of cryptocurrency, security goes beyond just protecting your wallet with a password or private key. One of the most deceptive and increasingly dangerous threats to crypto users today is social engineering.While you might think of cyberattacks as highly technical affairs, social engineering manipulates the most vulnerable aspect of security: human nature. At its core, social engineering refers to the act of manipulating people into divulging confidential information or granting unauthorized access to systems. Unlike traditional hacking, which typically exploits technological vulnerabilities, social engineering targets the human element. Attackers rely on deception, psychological manipulation and trust-building tactics to deceive their victims. By exploiting psychological weaknesses, attackers can trick individuals into giving up their private information, credentials or funds. In the world of crypto, this kind of manipulation is especially dangerous because transactions are irreversible, and the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies can make it even harder to recover lost funds. Once funds are transferred or access is granted, it’s almost impossible to reverse the action. This makes crypto users a prime target for social engineering attacks.Did you know? In 2024, phishing and spoofing topped the US Federal Bureau of Investigation’s list of reported cybercrimes, with victims also losing over $6.5 billion to crypto-related investment fraud, according to the Internet Crime Complaint Center.                  Anatomy of a social engineering attack: Step by step              Social engineering attacks trick crypto users by gaining trust, creating urgency, and then stealing sensitive info to drain their wallets.Step 1: The setup — Scouting for targetsScammers start by lurking on social media platforms such as X, Discord, Telegram and Reddit.They look for:Newbies asking for helpPeople showing off their gains or NFTsUsers who accidentally leak wallet addresses or emails.The more info they gather, the easier it is to craft a personalized attack.Step 2: The approach — Gaining trustNext, they reach out, pretending to be:A helpful support agent (e.g., from MetaMask, Binance)A famous crypto influencerA friend or community manager.They copy profile pictures, usernames (sometimes with slight changes), and even fake verification badges to seem real. This is all about lowering your guard.Step 3: The hook — Creating urgency or fearNow they trigger your emotions with urgent, scary or tempting messages:“Your wallet is at risk — act now!”“Exclusive airdrop ending in 5 minutes!”“We detected suspicious activity — please verify your account!”They use fear, excitement and time pressure to force you into quick action without thinking.Step 4: The ask — Extracting sensitive infoThis is where the real trap springs. They ask you to:Share your private key or seed phrase (a big red flag)Click a link to a phishing site that looks like MetaMask, Phantom or OpenSeaApprove a suspicious smart contract that drains your walletSend a small amount of crypto to “verify your account” or “unlock” funds.If you fall for this step — game over.Step 5: The heist — Draining your cryptoOnce they get your sensitive info or get you to sign a malicious transaction, they:Instantly drain your wallet of coins and tokensSwap your assets into privacy coins (e.g., Monero) to hide the trailLaunder the funds through mixers or exchanges.Victims usually realize the theft too late; sadly, funds are gone forever in most cases.Did you know? Onchain analyst ZachXBT uncovered an additional $45 million stolen from Coinbase users in early May 2025 through social engineering scams — a tactic he says is uniquely prevalent on the platform compared to other crypto exchanges.                  Common types of social engineering scams in crypto              Scammers target crypto users via phishing, impersonation, giveaway and romance scams, and fake investment platforms.PhishingPhishing remains one of the most prevalent forms of social engineering in the crypto world. This can take several forms but typically involves fake websites, apps or emails designed to look legitimate.Fake wallet apps: Scammers create fake versions of popular wallet apps like MetaMask or Trust Wallet. They trick users into downloading these apps, which then steal the private keys and funds stored within them.Fake exchanges: Similarly, attackers might impersonate well-known cryptocurrency exchanges. Victims are sent a link to a phishing site that looks identical to a legitimate platform, such as Binance or Coinbase. Once users log in and input their details, the attacker gains access to their funds.Fake MetaMask pop-ups: One common trick involves fake pop-ups that prompt MetaMask users to enter their seed phrase or private keys, thereby giving scammers control over their wallets.ImpersonationImpersonation scams occur when attackers pose as legitimate figures — whether that’s support staff, crypto influencers or even friends — to convince victims to hand over their information or funds.Fake support staff: In many cases, scammers will impersonate customer support agents for popular crypto wallets or exchanges. They might reach out to users claiming there’s an issue with their account and ask for sensitive information, such as a password or seed phrase.Influencers and friends: Attackers might pretend to be well-known crypto influencers or friends, asking for funds or convincing victims to participate in a scam. In some cases, attackers even go as far as to hijack a social media account of a crypto personality, offering fake giveaways or investment opportunities.Giveaway scams“Send 1 ETH, get 2 ETH back” — this is the classic giveaway scam that has made its rounds throughout the crypto community. Scammers pose as trusted entities, often mimicking celebrities like Elon Musk or official crypto exchanges, claiming they’re running a giveaway.The catch? The scammer asks you to send cryptocurrency to a specified wallet address in exchange for a larger amount of crypto that you’ll receive “later.” Once the funds are sent, they disappear.Romance and friendship scamsRomance and friendship scams, often known as pig butchering, occur when an attacker builds an emotional connection with the victim through messaging platforms like Telegram or even dating apps. Over time, the scammer gains the victim’s trust and then lures them into a fake investment opportunity, often involving cryptocurrency.Victims are manipulated into sending funds to what they believe is a secure investment, only to lose all their money when the scammer disappears.Fake investment platformsFake investment platforms promise extremely high returns with minimal risk — too good to be true. These scams might mimic legitimate crypto investment platforms, promising high returns on crypto investments or passive income streams. Once users deposit their funds, the platform either disappears or the scammer stops responding to communication.                  Why social engineering works so well in crypto              Social engineering attacks thrive in the cryptocurrency world because they take advantage of certain vulnerabilities that are unique to the space. The combination of psychological manipulation, technical complexity and the irreversible nature of crypto transactions makes crypto users particularly susceptible to these types of scams. Below are the key factors that explain why social engineering is so effective in the crypto environment:Fear and urgency: Crypto scams often create a sense of urgency to pressure victims into acting quickly. Common examples include emails or messages stating, “Your account is locked!” or “You need to verify your identity to avoid losing access to your funds!” These messages push users to make impulsive decisions that they later regret.Greed: Social engineering tactics often prey on a person’s desire to make quick, easy money. Scammers might promise users huge returns on investment or offer “exclusive” crypto deals that seem too good to pass up. This appeals to the greed of crypto investors, making them more likely to act impulsively.Lack of crypto security knowledge: Many crypto users, especially beginners, may not fully understand how crypto security works. This makes them more susceptible to attacks like phishing, where they might unknowingly give up their private keys or passwords. Scammers take advantage of this lack of knowledge to manipulate and deceive.                  How to protect yourself from social engineering attacks              While social engineering is hard to prevent entirely, staying vigilant, using 2FA, verifying links and practicing strong security habits can significantly reduce your risk.Several steps you can take to minimize your risk include:Be skeptical of unsolicited messages: Always be cautious when you receive unsolicited messages, whether by email, SMS or social media. If someone contacts you out of the blue asking for sensitive information or money, verify the authenticity of the message before acting.Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Always use 2FA whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security to your accounts, making it harder for attackers to gain access — even if they manage to obtain your password.Verify links and URLs: Before clicking on any link, hover your cursor over it to see where it leads. If the URL looks suspicious or doesn’t match the official site, don’t click it. Always double-check URLs for legitimacy, especially when dealing with crypto transactions.Educate yourself and others: The best defense against social engineering is knowledge. Stay informed about common scams and share this knowledge with others. The more you know, the less likely you are to fall for a scam.Use strong security practices: Consider using hardware wallets for storing your crypto assets, as these are considered much safer than keeping them on exchange platforms or software wallets. Always keep your private keys and seed phrases secure and never share them with anyone.In a crypto world full of scammers, your best defense is vigilance, education and strong security practices — because even the smartest tech can’t protect you from a well-crafted con.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-social-engineering-in-crypto-and-how-to-protect-yourself?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-12T08:04:15.000Z,"Can you stake Bitcoin (BTC)? Here’s what you need to know","Key takeawaysThough Bitcoin doesn’t support native staking, holders can earn yield through centralized lending platforms, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on Ethereum, and Bitcoin-related networks like Babylon and Stacks.WBTC allows BTC holders to participate in lending, liquidity pools and yield farming on Ethereum-based DeFi platforms like Aave and Curve but introduces bridge and smart contract risks.Protocols like Babylon and Stacks use mechanisms like native time-locked scripts or stacking to offer rewards without removing BTC from the Bitcoin blockchain.Custodial, smart contract and regulatory risks persist. Bitcoin’s community also remains divided on whether Bitcoin yield generation features align with its decentralized and trust-minimized ethos.Unlike proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains like Ethereum or Cardano, Bitcoin relies on proof-of-work (PoW) mining for network security. However, with the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and layer-2 innovations, Bitcoin (BTC) holders can now generate passive income through various yield-generating methods. These include centralized lending, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on Ethereum, and layer-2 solutions like Babylon and Stacks.This article explores how to earn yield on BTC, the risks involved and the technological advancements enabling these opportunities, all without altering Bitcoin’s core protocol.Staking vs. miningStaking and mining are two distinct consensus mechanisms used to secure blockchain networks and validate transactions. Staking is central to PoS blockchains like Ethereum and Solana. Participants lock up cryptocurrency to become validators, who are randomly selected to create new blocks and confirm transactions, earning rewards. The more coins staked, the higher the chance of selection.Mining, used by PoW blockchains like Bitcoin and Litecoin, involves miners solving complex mathematical puzzles with powerful computers. The first to solve the puzzle adds a new block and receives a reward. Mining demands significant energy and hardware.Bitcoin’s PoW design means it does not support staking. The network relies entirely on miners to ensure decentralization and security. There are no validators or staking rewards in the traditional sense. Yield-generating methods for BTC, such as lending or layer-2 solutions, are not equivalent to PoS staking.Did you know? Some staking platforms offer liquid staking, where you get a token representing your staked asset (like stETH for Ether). This lets you earn staking rewards and still use your capital in DeFi protocols.Ways to earn yield on BitcoinWhile you cannot natively stake BTC due to its PoW mechanism, there are alternative methods to help you earn yield on your BTC holdings and make passive income. These methods often involve using third-party platforms or bridging BTC to other blockchains.Centralized lending platformsCentralized lending platforms like Binance Earn, Nexo and Ledn enable you to earn with BTC deposited, which the platform lends to institutional borrowers. In return, you receive interest, which might be paid daily or monthly. But this method involves custodial risk, as users must trust the platform to remain solvent and secure. The collapse of firms like Celsius and BlockFi has highlighted this vulnerability. WBTC on EthereumWBTC is an ERC-20 token backed 1:1 by BTC, held by a centralized custodian (BitGo). It enables BTC holders to engage in Ethereum-based DeFi protocols, such as lending on Aave, providing liquidity on Curve or yield farming. This unlocks DeFi’s potential but introduces risks from BitGo’s custody, bridge vulnerabilities and smart contract bugs.Bitcoin layer-2 platformsEmerging layer-2 platforms such as Babylon and Stacks also enable you to explore Bitcoin-native yield opportunities. Babylon locks BTC in time-locked scripts to secure its PoS network, while Stacks uses a proof-of-transfer (PoX) model where STX tokenholders lock tokens to earn BTC rewards. These platforms expand Bitcoin’s utility without leaving its ecosystem entirely.Did you know? Ethereum became the largest PoS network in 2022 after “the Merge,” replacing miners with validators. This move reportedly reduced the blockchain’s energy consumption by over 99.95%, making it one of the greenest major crypto networks.How to earn yield with BTC on a centralized lending platformEarning yield on BTC via centralized platforms is straightforward. Choose a reputable platform, create a verified account, deposit BTC, select a flexible or fixed-term lending option, confirm terms, and monitor earnings. Funds can typically be withdrawn after the term.Using Binance Earn as an example, the platform offers multiple yield options:Simple Earn: Beginner-friendly, offering stable yields through flexible or locked savings products.Dual Investment: Higher-risk, with returns based on the settlement price of two assets, exposing users to market volatility.On-chain Yield: Bridges funds to DeFi protocols like Aave, with variable yields managed by Binance.Yields and terms vary by option and market conditions. Simple Earn offers lower, predictable returns with flexible withdrawals, while Dual Investment and On-chain Yield may yield higher but riskier returns with locked terms. Check Binance Earn for current rates.After subscribing:Simple Earn: BTC is locked (fixed term) or withdrawable (flexible term), with interest paid daily or at term’s end.Dual Investment: Funds are committed to a target price and settlement date, with yields paid in the deposited or alternative asset.On-chain Yield: Funds are deployed to DeFi protocols, with Binance handling gas fees and smart contracts. Withdrawals may face delays due to liquidity or network issues.Rewards depend on the platform, BTC amount and program terms.How to earn yield with WBTC on EthereumWBTC allows BTC holders to earn yield on Ethereum’s DeFi platforms, such as Aave or Curve, by depositing WBTC into liquidity pools and earning interest or fees.Steps to earn yield with WBTC, using Curve as an example:Convert BTC to WBTC: Use a centralized exchange (CEX) (e.g., Binance) or decentralized bridge (e.g., RenBridge) to convert BTC to WBTC, custodied by BitGo.Transfer WBTC to a wallet: Move WBTC to a Web3 wallet like MetaMask and make sure you have enough Ether (ETH) for gas fees.Connect to a DeFi protocol: Visit Curve.fi and deposit WBTC into a liquidity pool via the platform’s interface.Earn yield: By providing liquidity, you earn interest or fees based on pool performance.How to earn yield using Bitcoin layer 2sLayer-2 solutions like Babylon and Stacks enable yield generation by leveraging Bitcoin’s security. Babylon, for example, locks BTC as collateral to secure its PoS network, connecting to Cosmos zones (interconnected blockchains). Babylon’s Genesis mainnet launched on April 10, 2025, with over 57,000 BTC staked, valued at approximately $4.6 billion.Steps to earn yield with Babylon:Set up a compatible wallet: Use a wallet like OKX or Phantom, supporting Native SegWit (bc1q) or Taproot (bc1p) addresses. Avoid wallets with Bitcoin Inscriptions (Ordinals).Access the Babylon stake app: Visit the Babylon Stake app, which is active post-Genesis launch.Connect your wallet: Link your BTC wallet and approve digital signature requests for platform interaction.Choose a finality provider: Select from over 250 finality providers (e.g., Galaxy, Figment) that secure Babylon’s network.Set transaction fees: Choose default or custom fees (higher fees ensure faster confirmation) and enter the BTC amount to lock.Confirm and monitor: Lock BTC via the app and track status in the Babylon Staking Terminal. Rewards include BABY tokens, split 50-50 between BTC and BABY stakers.Did you know? In some countries, crypto yield rewards are taxed as income upon receipt and as capital gains when sold. Tax treatment varies, so consult a professional.Innovative mechanisms in Bitcoin layer-2 protocolsLayer-2 protocols enhance Bitcoin’s scalability and functionality. Babylon and Stacks introduce unique mechanisms to generate yield while leveraging Bitcoin’s security.Native time-locked scripts in Babylon ProtocolBabylon locks BTC in self-custodial, time-locked scripts on the Bitcoin blockchain, using it as collateral to secure its PoS network, launched on April 10, 2025. This non-custodial model supports Cosmos zones without requiring bridges or wrapping. BTC stakers delegate to Finality Providers, earning BABY tokens, while BABY stakers support block production. This trustless system enables delegated voting and restaking across PoS chains.Stacking in the Stacks ProtocolStacking is Stacks’ yield mechanism, using proof-of-transfer (PoX). STX tokenholders lock Stacks (STX) for ~2 weeks to support network consensus, earning BTC rewards paid by Stacks miners. This non-custodial process, available via platforms like Okcoin or Xverse, creates an economic link to Bitcoin without locking BTC itself.Coinbase Bitcoin Yield Fund (CBYF) ExplainedCoinbase Asset Management has launched the Coinbase Bitcoin Yield Fund (CBYF) on May 1, aiming to deliver sustainable Bitcoin-denominated returns for institutional investors outside the US. The fund uses a conservative cash-and-carry arbitrage strategy, capitalizing on price gaps between spot and futures markets, while steering clear of high-risk tactics like leveraged loans or call selling. Targeting annual net returns of 4–8% in BTC, CBYF offers a safer alternative for earning yield on Bitcoin — an asset that lacks native staking options unlike other cryptocurrencies.Risks involved in earning yield with BTCGenerating yield on BTC involves risks distinct from PoS staking due to reliance on third-party services or layer 2s:Custodial risk: Centralized platforms (e.g., Binance, Nexo) and WBTC’s custodian (BitGo) hold BTC, risking losses if they face insolvency, hacks or regulatory shutdowns.Smart contract risk: WBTC bridges and DeFi platforms like Aave are vulnerable to bugs or exploits.Liquidity risk: Locked BTC in fixed-term programs or low-liquidity pools may be inaccessible during market shifts.Network maturity: Newer protocols like Babylon may face technical or adoption challenges.Market risk: Price volatility can offset yield during bear markets.Regulatory risk: Centralized platforms and custodians face Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) scrutiny, and yield may be taxed as income or capital gains, depending on jurisdiction. How earning yield with BTC may evolveBitcoin’s yield landscape is evolving through layer-2 and DeFi innovations. Babylon and Stacks pioneer trustless solutions, locking BTC or STX without centralized custodians. Future advancements may include more non-custodial, Bitcoin-native systems using cryptographic tools to unlock value while preserving Bitcoin’s censorship resistance. However, purists argue that yield generation risks diluting Bitcoin’s role as hard money, sparking debates over balancing utility and security.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

They have both pleaded not guilty.In their letter, prosecutors argued they “acted in good faith” in disclosing the “contents of this informal conversation” between them and Kevin O’Connor, the chief of FinCEN’s Virtual Assets and Emerging Technology Section in the Enforcement and Compliance Division, and Policy Division staffer Lorena Valente.A highlighted excerpt of the prosecutors’ letter arguing that they disclosed a discussion with FinCEN on time and the discussion was an “informal conversation.” Source: PACERThey claimed O’Connor and Valente’s comments were “their individual, informal, and caveated opinion” on whether Samourai would need to register as a money transmitter under FinCEN regulations.FinCEN “did not have a sense” of broaching SamouraiThe prosecutor’s letter noted that an email from one of the prosecutors summarizing the August 2023 call with FinCEN said that because Samourai doesn’t take custody of the crypto, it “would strongly suggest that Samourai is NOT acting as an MSB [money services business].”However, it noted FinCEN staff “did not have a sense of what FinCEN would decide if this question were presented to their FinCEN policy committee.”An excerpt of an email from prosecutor Andrew Chan said FinCEN “did not have a sense” of what it would decide on Samourai. Source: CourtListenerSamourai’s lawyers had claimed that the call showed Rodriguez and Hill “were not money transmitters under FinCEN’s guidance” and that they “could not possibly be prosecuted for not having a license.”The Samourai co-founders had bid to dismiss the case in April, pointing to Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche’s memo released that month saying the Justice Department wouldn’t prosecute crypto mixers for “unwitting violations of regulations.” In their letter, prosecutors addressed the memo, arguing the court “should not consider” it, as the memo states it “may not be relied upon to create any right or benefit” against the US or its departments.Legal Panel: XRP win leaves Ripple a ‘bad actor’ with no crypto legal precedent set",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/feds-say-fincen-talk-samourai-wallet-disclosed-on-time?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-12T06:12:06.000Z,"DeFi lending TVL is outpacing DEXs due to more sustainable yield — VC","Crypto users could be looking for a more sustainable yield this cycle, as total value locked in decentralized finance (DeFi) lending continues to hit new highs while decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have lagged in comparison.DeFi lending protocols are currently the leading DeFi vertical in TVL at $53.6 billion, representing 43% of the $124.6 billion locked across all DeFi protocols. The figure also surpasses liquid staking.Multichain lending protocol Aave currently holds $25 billion of locked value, accounting for nearly half of the DeFi lending market.Change in crypto lending protocol TVL since 2019. Source: DeFiLlamaIn stark contrast, DEXs, which once held nearly double the TVL of their closest competitor, have dropped from $85.3 billion in November 2021 to $21.5 billion today.Explaining the rise in DeFi lending and fall in DEX TVL, the founder of crypto fund Apollo Capital, Henrik Andersson, told Cointelegraph that lending is arguably the “only sustainable way to produce yield” in DeFi, as DEX liquidity pooling has largely become unprofitable due to impermanent loss.He also argued that the industry-leading DEX Uniswap v3’s more “capital efficient” design, relative to Uniswap v2, may have contributed to the DEX TVL fall, as liquidity providers can now earn more rewards with less upfront capital.Andersson also pointed out that the rise of intent-based swaps — a relatively new crosschain trading mechanism — may have further reduced the DEX TVL, as market makers typically source liquidity from centralized exchanges to facilitate these swaps.DeFi lending protocols like Aave and Compound Finance enable crypto users to lend assets to earn interest or borrow against collateral. Smart contracts manage deposits, loans and interest rates to ensure trustless transactions.DeFi users who supply Ether (ETH) and Tether (USDT) on Aave, for example, currently earn an annual percentage yield of 1.86% and 3.17%, respectively.Providing stablecoins and Ether to DEX pools such as Uniswap’s can offer higher rewards; however, as Andersson pointed out, they’re far less sustainable, fluctuating by the day.DeFi now dominates CeFi in crypto lending market DeFi-based crypto lending accounted for around 65% of the total market by the end of 2024 and has increased or maintained its market share against centralized lenders every quarter since Q4 2022, an April report from crypto investment firm Galaxy Digital showed.The fall started occurring around the time several centralized crypto lenders such as Genesis, Celsius Network, BlockFi and Voyager fell bankrupt, causing TVL to fall massively.Related: Bitcoin hits $103K but DeFi is a mixed bag: Finance RedefinedTheir collective downfall led to an estimated 78% collapse in the size of the crypto lending market from the 2022 peak to the bear market trough, Galaxy noted.Change in market share between centralized and decentralized crypto lending protocols between Q3 2018 and Q4 2024.

The victim had finished hosting a crypto-related event in downtown Las Vegas, and when he returned home, the suspects forced him into a vehicle and drove him to a remote desert area an hour away from the city. There, they forced him to hand over passwords to his accounts, according to a May 10 report from Las Vegas local news outlet 8 News Now. The man was allegedly told to comply with the teens’ demands if he wanted to “live to see another day,” and because they also “had his dad and would kill him,” according to the report. It’s also alleged that a fourth person may have been communicating with the three young men through a phone call during the incident, which the victim could hear through a speakerphone.After having his accounts drained of $4 million in crypto and NFTs, the victim reportedly walked five miles back through the desert to reach a gas station where he could call a friend for help. Two 16-year-olds from Florida are facing charges including robbery, kidnapping, and extortion in connection with the incident. A third teen allegedly involved in the plot has left the country, prosecutors say.One of the young men is behind bars with bail set at $4 million, while the other has been released under house arrest with electronic monitoring. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for June, with both teens set to be tried as adults. Digital asset lawyer Sasha Hodder said in a May 10 X post that this case illustrates how “Crypto theft is evolving.

Bitcoin (BTC) outperformed stocks and held up “incredibly strong” during a sharp sell-off on stock markets in April, following Donald Trump’s announcement of tariffs on “Liberation Day,” observed crypto trader “Daan Crypto” on May 11.Following its plunge to $75,000 on April 7, Bitcoin recovered strongly to trade 27% higher at around $95,000 by the end of the month. Meanwhile, indexes like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq declined in April. At the time, people wondered if Bitcoin’s relative strength came from the narrative that countries were using Bitcoin to bypass tariffs. The analyst said the opposite should theoretically occur if the trade deal is confirmed. “Theoretically speaking, if the trade uncertainty was what was making BTC outperform, it should stop outperforming after we hit the most important deal, which includes China.”Bitcoin performance since Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement. Source: Daan CryptoOn May 11, the White House announced that talks between the US and China regarding a trade deal have made “substantial progress.” However, no official agreement had been announced.Related: Bitcoin must close the week above this level to start 'price discovery 2'“We will be giving details tomorrow, but I can tell you that the talks were productive,” said US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.However, if Bitcoin keeps doing its thing and outperforming, “it’s safe to assume that tariffs likely have little direct impact on how BTC is treated or used,” Daan concluded. Markets await trade deal announcement Some analysts, however, believe that Bitcoin will likely jump if a trade deal comes through, along with potential rate cuts. “We believe that institutional investors are less apprehensive about investing in Bitcoin and crypto as US-China trade talks come to a conclusion and the likelihood of rate cuts increases,” Jeff Mei, chief operations officer at BTSE, told Cointelegraph. Meanwhile, Jupiter Zheng, researcher at HashKey Capital, said, “A US-China trade deal could signal stability in global markets, potentially driving investors to seek growth opportunities and send capital into alternative assets.”“Bitcoin could also see new highs as a result, particularly if the deal weakens the dollar or leads to renewed liquidity flows into emerging markets.”Analyst Will Clemente said on X that only a solid announcement of a trade deal is likely to keep momentum rolling. “Feels like you’re gonna need a real, tangible announcement on the China front to keep things moving here locally, momentum starting to stall out on BTC for the first time in a bit,” he said.  Magazine: Bitcoin eyes ‘crazy numbers,’ JD Vance set for Bitcoin talk: Hodler’s Digest",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-trump-trade-deal-china-shed-light-bitcoin-safe-haven?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
2025-05-12T03:20:12.000Z,"Stablecoin bill gets second chance with Northern Mariana lawmakers","Tinian, a small island in the US territory of the Northern Mariana Islands, could get a second chance at launching a stablecoin after the territory’s Senate voted to override the governor’s earlier veto of its stablecoin bill.On May 9, the Northern Mariana Islands Senate voted 7-1 to override Governor Arnold Palacios' April 11 veto of the bill, which would allow the Tinian local government to issue licenses to internet casinos and includes a provision for the Tinian treasurer to issue, manage and redeem a “Tinian Stable Token.” The bill will now head to the 20-member Northern Mariana Islands House, which will need a two-thirds majority vote to override the veto and pass the bill into law.If the House is quick to pass the bill, the Tinian government could be in the lead for the first US public entity to issue a stablecoin. It’s in a race against the state of Wyoming, which is aiming to issue a stablecoin by July.Tinian is governed by the local government, the Municipality of Tinian and Aguiguan, and is one of four municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, a small US territory in the Pacific north of Guam. Tinian has just over 2,000 residents, and its economy heavily relies on tourism.Senators push “much-needed” bill despite “deep concerns” Governor Palacios said in his letter last month that he vetoed the bill as it “presents several legal issues and may be unconstitutional” and would regulate an activity that could not “be clearly restricted” to Tinian.Democrat Senator Celina Babauta, the only one to vote against overriding the veto, said before the vote that she had “deep concerns with respect to the lack of resources, the lack of manpower” to enforce the gambling law and police use of the stablecoin.“We are restricted by federal statutes and must comply with that,” she added.Senator Celina Babauta (right) delivers remarks at a Senate hearing alongside Senator Karl King-Nabors (middle). Source: YouTube“We struggle with trying to find creative and innovative ways to diversify our economy and our industries,” Babauta said. “I don't believe that gambling is the only thing that we can be looking forward to every single time there's an investor that comes in.”However, Republican Senator Karl King-Nabors, who represents Tinian and co-authored the bill, said it was “a far more stringent and efficient way to oversee the online gaming aspect.”“This stablecoin is tracked through software, and if anything, it allows for more transparency when it comes to the Tinian Casino Gaming Control Commission,” he added.King-Nabors said the bill aligned with “much-needed” economic diversification measures, as the local economy was yet to bounce back from a COVID-19 pandemic-induced slump.“This legislation stands at a time where we're going through so much economic hardships,” King-Nabors added. “I find it difficult that we're constantly having to step over obstacles when we're trying to incentivize and look for ways to bring in revenue that don't affect our environment, that don't require a brick and mortar, that don't impact our land.”Tinian bids for fully-backed stablecoinRepublican Senator for Tinian, Jude Hofschneider, led the introduction of the bill in February, which aims to amend a local Tinian law to allow internet-only casino licenses, along with allowing the island to launch a fully backed US dollar-pegged stablecoin.A four-member Tinian delegation to the Marianas legislature, which includes Hofschneider and King-Nabors, had passed the bill to Governor Palacios in a unanimous vote on March 12.Statements shared with Cointelegraph in March said the stablecoin is called the Marianas US Dollar (MUSD) and will be backed by cash and US Treasury bills held in reserve by the Tinian Municipal Treasury.The Tinian government chose tech services firm Marianas Rai Corporation, based in the Northern Mariana Islands’ capital of Saipan, as the exclusive infrastructure provider to issue and redeem MUSD.MUSD is built on the eCash blockchain, a network that rebranded from Bitcoin Cash ABC in 2021 and is a fork of Bitcoin Cash, a blockchain that split off from Bitcoin in 2017.Related: Senator Tim Scott slams partisan politics for failed stablecoin bill Marianas Rai Corp. co-founder and technology chief Vin Armani told Cointelegraph in April that it was “in active discussions with potential partners” about launching the token after Governor Palacios’ veto and was “poised to act quickly” as US Congress is looking to pass stablecoin laws.In the US, one stablecoin bill, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, has since stalled in Congress after Senate Democrats pulled support for the bill due to concerns about President Donald Trump’s sprawling crypto ventures.Another stablecoin-regulating bill in the House, the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act, has also lost Democrat support due to Trump’s crypto tie-ups.Legal Panel: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/tinian-stablecoin-bill-comeback-mariana-senate-override-veto?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
2025-05-12T02:55:08.000Z,"‘Dark stablecoins’ could emerge as regulations tighten","Censorship-resistant “dark stablecoins” could come in increasing demand as governments tighten their oversight of the industry. Stablecoins have been used for various groups to store assets due to a lack of government interference; however, with regulations pending, that could soon change, Ki Young Ju, CEO of crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant, said in a May 11 X post.“Soon, any stablecoin issued by a country could face strict govt regulation, similar to traditional banks. Transfers might automatically trigger tax collection through smart contracts, and wallets could be frozen or require paperwork based on government rules,” he said.“People who used stablecoins for big international transfers might start looking for censorship-resistant dark stablecoins instead.”On the heels of US President Donald Trump’s crypto-friendly administration assuming power earlier this year, lawmakers are weighing stablecoin legislation, which seeks to regulate US stablecoins, ensuring their legal use for payments. The European Union has already brought in its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which, among other measures, mandates that stablecoins be regulated and transparent.Source: Ki Young JuJu speculates that a dark or private stablecoin could be created as an algorithmic stablecoin, with the value maintained through algorithmic mechanisms rather than being pegged to an external asset like gold, which makes it susceptible to interference from authorities. “One possible example could be a decentralized stablecoin that follows the price of regulated coins like USDC using data oracles like Chainlink,” he said.Another way would be stablecoins issued by countries that don’t censor financial transactions, or, for example, if Tether chooses not to comply with US government regulations in the future.“USDT itself used to be considered a censorship-resistant stablecoin. If Tether chooses not to comply with US government regulations under a future Trump administration, it could become a dark stablecoin in an increasingly censored internet economy,” Ju said.Privacy technology in crypto is already being usedZcash (ZEC) and Monero (XMR) — while they aren’t stablecoins —already shield transactions and allow users to send and receive funds without revealing their transaction data on the blockchain.Related: Russia finance ministry official floats country making own stablecoins: ReportSeveral projects are also working on using similar technology for stablecoins, such as Zephyr Protocol, a Monero fork that hides transactions from being revealed on the blockchain. PARScoin also hides user identities, transaction values, and links to past transactions.The market cap of US dollar-denominated stablecoins has continued to grow, crossing $230 billion in April, a report from investment banking giant Citigroup found. That’s an increase of 54% since last year, with Tether (USDT) and USDC (USDC) dominating 90% of the market.Meanwhile, total stablecoin volumes hit $27.6 trillion in 2024, surpassing the combined volumes of Visa and Mastercard by 7.7%. Magazine: Ridiculous ‘Chinese Mint’ crypto scam, Japan dives into stablecoins: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/regulations-spark-censorship-resistant-dark-stablecoins?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-11T15:00:00.000Z,"AI agents are coming for DeFi — Wallets are the weakest link","Opinion by: Sean Li, co-founder of Magic LabsCrypto markets run 24/7. Human traders don’t. As AI agents begin to manage liquidity, optimize yield, and execute trades at all hours, they’re quickly becoming essential infrastructure for decentralized finance’s (DeFi) future. While AI agents are evolving from niche tools for quant traders into mainstream financial operators, they’re rapidly outpacing the wallets meant to secure them. Advancements in account abstraction and smart contract wallets have emerged, but most DeFi platforms still predominately rely on externally owned account wallets that require manual approvals at every step. Early-stage programmable solutions exist but remain fragmented, costly on layer-1 networks and adopted by only a tiny fraction of users.As AI agents increasingly operate in DeFi, this infrastructure limitation becomes critical. We need standardized infrastructure that allows for secure, cost-effective automation with verifiable guardrails across multiple blockchain ecosystems. Automation needs guardrails, not guessworkThe rise of autonomous agents opens new possibilities: hands-free DeFi strategies, real-time portfolio optimization and crosschain arbitrage. Without programmable permissions and onchain visibility, however, delegating control to AI can expose users to catastrophic risk. Malicious bots, hallucinating agents and poorly designed automation can drain wallets before a human notices.We’ve already seen what happens when agent infrastructure fails. In September 2024, users of the Telegram-based trading bot Banana Gun lost 563 Ether (ETH) (approximately $1.9 million) through an exploited oracle vulnerability that allowed attackers to intercept messages and gain unauthorized access to user wallets. More recently, attackers breached Aixbt’s dashboard and issued commands to transfer funds directly, resulting in the loss of 55.5 ETH worth over $100,000. These aren’t isolated incidents — they are warning signs of systemic vulnerability in our automation infrastructure. Legacy wallets can’t support autonomous agentsDespite years of wallet innovation, the architecture remains static mainly: sign a transaction, broadcast it, repeat. Most wallets aren’t built to understand “intent,” verify that automation matches user-defined rules, or restrict activity by time, asset type or strategy. This rigidity creates an all-or-nothing dynamic: either you maintain manual control and miss out on fast-moving opportunities or you hand over access entirely to opaque third-party systems. For AI-powered DeFi to scale securely as it builds more utility, we need programmable, composable and verifiable infrastructure. Programmable permissions are the new trust layerAs smart contracts encode logic into DeFi protocols, wallet infrastructure must encode logic into user control. That means enabling session-based permissions, cryptographic verification of agent actions and the ability to revoke access in real-time.Recent: AI and blockchain — A match made in heavenWith these features in place, users can delegate trading, rebalancing or strategy execution without giving up complete control. This approach doesn’t just mitigate risk — it expands access. Advanced DeFi strategies could become accessible to users without technical knowledge and managed securely by agents operating within verifiable constraints. Programmable infrastructure makes DeFi scalableProgrammable wallet infrastructure doesn’t just make DeFi safer — it makes it scalable. Fragmentation across chains and protocols has long been a barrier to automated strategies. A universal keystore protocol that syncs permissions across networks can streamline crosschain delegation and open the door for interoperable agent ecosystems. As institutional interest in DeFi grows, secure automation will be non-negotiable. Most firms won’t allow AI agents to interact with capital without verifiable guardrails. Just as zero-knowledge proofs are becoming essential to privacy and compliance, programmable wallet permissions may become standard for agent-based security. The future of DeFiSome may argue that AI can’t be trusted with financial autonomy, but traditional markets have already adopted algorithmic trading and black box automation. DeFi isn’t immune — it’s simply unprepared. If crypto is to maintain its transparency and user sovereignty principles, it must build infrastructure that keeps AI agents in check. That starts with rebuilding wallets as interfaces and operating systems for the autonomous, multichain economy. DeFi is on the edge of an automation revolution. The question isn’t whether agents will participate. Whether we give them the rails, they need to act in service of users, not in spite of them.Opinion by: Sean Li, co-founder of Magic Labs.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-11T13:10:42.000Z,"Pectra lets hackers drain wallets with just an offchain signature","Ethereum’s latest network upgrade, Pectra, introduced powerful new features aimed at improving scalability and smart account functionality — but it also opened a dangerous new attack vector that could allow hackers to drain funds from user wallets using only an offchain signature.Under the Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7 at epoch 364032, attackers can exploit a new transaction type to take control of externally owned accounts (EOAs) without requiring the user to sign an onchain transaction.Arda Usman, a Solidity smart contract auditor, confirmed to Cointelegraph that “it becomes possible for an attacker to drain an EOA’s funds using only an offchain signed message (no direct onchain transaction signed by the user).”At the center of the risk is EIP-7702, a core component of the Pectra upgrade. The Ethereum Improvement Proposal introduces the SetCode transaction (type 0x04), which enables users to delegate control of their wallet to another contract simply by signing a message.If an attacker obtains this signature — say, via a phishing site — they can overwrite the wallet’s code with a small proxy that forwards calls to their malicious contract.“Once the code is set,” Usman explained, “the attacker can invoke that code to transfer out the account’s ETH or tokens—all without the user ever signing a normal transfer transaction.”Source: Vladimir S. | Officer's NotesRelated: Ethereum Pectra upgrade adds new featuresWallets can be altered with offchain signatureYehor Rudytsia, onchain researcher at Hacken, noted that this new transaction type introduced by Pectra allows arbitrary code to be installed on the user’s account, essentially turning their wallet into a programmable smart contract.“This tx type allows the user to set arbitrary code (smart contract) to be able to execute operations on the user’s behalf,” Rudytsia said.Before Pectra, wallets could not be modified without a transaction signed directly by the user. Now, a simple offchain signature can install code that delegates complete control to an attacker’s contract.“Pre-Pectra, users needed to send transaction (not sign message) to allow their funds to be moved… Post-Pectra, any operation may be executed from the contract which user approved via SET_CODE,” Rudytsia explained.The threat is real and immediate. “Pectra activated May 7, 2025. From that moment, any valid delegation signature is actionable,” Usman warned. He added that smart contracts relying on outdated assumptions, such as using tx.origin or basic EOA-only checks, are particularly vulnerable.Wallets and interfaces that fail to detect or properly represent these new transaction types are most at risk. Rudytsia warned that “wallets are vulnerable if they do not analyze Ethereum’s transaction types,” especially transaction type 0x04.He emphasized that wallet engines must clearly display delegation requests and flag any suspicious addresses.This new form of attack can be easily executed through common offchain interactions like phishing emails, fake DApps, or Discord scams.“We believe it will be the most popular attack vector regarding these breaking changes introduced by Pectra,” Rudytsia said. “From now on, users have to carefully validate what they are going to sign.”Source: NoirRelated: Pectra features already in use: Ethereum EIP-7702 wallets roll outHardware wallets are not safer anymoreHardware wallets are no longer inherently safer, Rudytsia said. He added that hardware wallets from now on are at the same risk as hot wallets from the perspective of signing malicious messages. “If done—all the funds are gone in a moment.”There are ways to stay safe, but they require awareness. “Users should not sign the messages they do not understand,” Rudytsia advised. He also urged wallet developers to provide clear warnings when users are asked to sign a delegation message.Special caution should be taken with new delegation signature formats introduced by EIP-7702, which are not compatible with existing EIP-191 or EIP-712 standards. These messages often appear as simple 32-byte hashes and may bypass normal wallet warnings.“If a message includes your account nonce, it’s probably affecting your account directly,” Usman warned. “Normal sign-in messages or offchain commitments don’t usually involve your nonce.”Adding to the risk, EIP-7702 allows for signatures with chain_id = 0, meaning the signed message can be replayed on any Ethereum-compatible chain. “Understand it can be used anywhere,” Usman said.While multisignature wallets remain more secure under this upgrade, thanks to their requirement for multiple signers, single-key wallets — hardware or otherwise — must adopt new signature parsing and red-flagging tools to prevent potential exploitation.Alongside EIP-7702, Pectra also included EIP-7251, which raised Ethereum’s validator staking limit from 32 to 2,048 ETH, and EIP-7691, which increases the number of data blobs per block for better layer-2 scalability.Magazine: Bitcoin eyes ‘crazy numbers,’ JD Vance set for Bitcoin talk: Hodler’s Digest, May 4 – 10",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/pectra-wallet-exploit-offchain-signature-risk?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
2025-05-11T13:00:00.000Z,"8 major crypto firms announce US expansion this year","Crypto services platform Nexo shared its plans to reenter the United States market on Monday, marking the eighth major crypto firm to announce such plans since US President Donald Trump took office at the start of the year.Firms like Circle, Binance and OKX are banking on favorable regulatory clarity in 2025 to herald their US expansion. Bills like the STABLE Act and the GENIUS Act are advancing in Congress, which, if implemented, will lay the groundwork for swift success.Trump and his family are actively involved in some of these planned expansions. Nexo’s recent announcement was backed by Donald Trump Jr., who said, “We see the opportunity for the financial sector and want to ensure we bring that back to the US.”Amid concerns of conflicts of interest and blatant token shilling by the Trump family, it remains to be seen whether these upcoming regulations will adequately protect everyday investors. Regardless, these are the eight firms that have banked on big bucks in the US this year.Binance.US resumes USD services; CZ seeks clemency Binance.US officially reinstated USD deposit and withdrawal services less than a month into Trump’s presidency. They were halted on June 13, 2023, on the back of a civil enforcement action by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), claiming willful evasion of US laws and operating illegally in the country. Binance later settled for $2.7 billion; then-CEO Changpeng Zhao paid $150 million.Soon after halting USD on- and off-ramps, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Binance and its then-CEO, Changpeng Zhao, with a lawsuit. The agency claimed Zhao and Binance “engaged in an extensive web of deception, conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure, and calculated evasion of the law.”In November 2023, Binance and CZ agreed on a settlement with the Department of Justice that included pleading guilty to federal charges, including violating Anti-Money Laundering laws, a $4.3-billion fine, CZ’s dismissal as CEO and a prison sentence.Zhao has sought clemency from President Trump, who has pardoned a number of crypto executives. Zhao (right) discusses his clemency request. Source: Farokh RadioeToro files for US IPO after 2024 enforcement actionOnline trading platform eToro publicly filed its registration statement for a proposed initial public offering (IPO) on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “ETOR.” The IPO is anticipated to occur as early as Q2 2025, pending market conditions, with eToro seeking a $4-billion valuation with plans to raise $500 million by offering 10 million Class A shares. The trading platform ran into some trouble with the SEC in 2024, when the agency claimed eToro “operated an unregistered broker and unregistered clearing agency in connection with its trading platform that facilitated buying and selling certain crypto assets as securities.”As a result, eToro paid a fine and agreed to reduce its crypto offerings for US customers to Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Ether (ETH).The move signals growing investor confidence in the future of retail cryptocurrency trading platforms in the US as the jurisdiction reorients its rules defining cryptocurrencies and loosens restrictions that made it more difficult for such platforms to receive banking services. OKX relaunches in the US months after $500-million settlementOKX, a major global cryptocurrency exchange, announced its reentry into the US market in April 2025. The company is implementing a phased rollout plan throughout the year and has established a new regional headquarters in San Jose, California. The firm also named Roshan Robert, recently of Barclays, as head of its US operations. Edit the caption here or remove the textThe relaunch comes just months after the firm announced a settlement with the US Department of Justice (DOJ). US attorneys alleged that the platform “knowingly violated anti-money laundering laws and avoided implementing required policies to prevent criminals from abusing our financial system” for over seven years. OKX paid a hefty $500-million fine, pleaded guilty to operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business, and agreed to pay for an external compliance consultant. In a statement, OKX said, “There were no allegations of customer harm, no charges against any Company employee and no government appointed monitor as part of the settlement.Related: OKX to restart DEX with anti-abuse upgrades after Lazarus ‘misuse’Robert told Fortune that the firm was ramping up its compliance and risk management infrastructures ahead of the relaunch. He also cited the improving regulatory landscape as a contributor to the relaunch. “The rulemaking will take some time, but there is a path that we can see,” he said.Nexo returns to US markets after deadlock with regulatorsNexo, a global digital assets wealth platform, announced its return to the US market on April 28, 2025, at an event in Sofia, Bulgaria. According to industry media, US customers will have access to Nexo’s asset-backed credit lines, crypto savings accounts and advanced trading options.Nexo left the US in 2022 after 18 months of negotiations with federal regulators reached an impasse. Eight different state regulators had charged Nexo with allegedly failing to register its Earn Interest Product.Nexo co-founder Antoni Trenchev credited the crypto-friendly approach of President Trump with his firm’s relaunch: “America is back — and so is Nexo.”“Nexo is returning to America — stronger, smarter, and determined to win,” he added.Circle relocates to NYC ahead of IPOCircle, the issuer of the USDC (USDC) stablecoin, is relocating its global headquarters from Boston to New York City in early 2025. The move to One World Trade Center aligns with Circle’s plans for an initial public offering and reflects its commitment to integrating with traditional financial markets. Circle filed for its IPO on April 1 and plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup are serving as lead underwriters. The firm is seeking a $5-billion valuation. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said, “Our new headquarters near the top of One World Trade Center is a symbol of the trust, security and stability we’re building as a critical infrastructure provider for the future of finance.”Circle initially sought to go public via a blank-check firm in 2022, but the deal fell through. The deal would have valued Circle at $9 billion at the time. Crypto.com introduces stock and ETF tradingCrypto.com is expanding its services in the US throughout 2025, including introducing trading for stocks and ETFs. The company is rolling out these offerings in phases as part of its 2025 roadmap, including significant expansions of its banking, crypto, stock and credit card services for US customers. The plan shows the company’s broader strategy of integrating crypto with traditional finance, a theme recurring with many crypto and finance firms operating in the US. Travis McGhee, Crypto.com managing director and head of global capital markets, said that the firm is letting clients “marry up that capability [trading stocks and ETFs] with your crypto trading, as well as your crypto derivative trading.” McGhee added that “there’s a lot of tailwinds” pushing the industry ahead, including an “administration that is [...] looking to put a regulatory framework into place.” “That just bodes well for a strong market and a strong future for crypto.”a16z returns to US after initial UK moveAndreessen Horowitz (a16z) announced that it is closing shop in the UK and focusing its efforts on the US. In a Jan. 24 X post, Anthony Albanese, chief operating officer of Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto arm, said the firm will be closing its UK branch despite the “enthusiasm for crypto building and adoption” in the country.According to Sifted, the UK government had spent five years wooing a16z to move to London, just for the firm to leave 18 months after it opened its offices there.

When it’s above 75, it’s “Altcoin Season,” meaning altcoins are doing better than Bitcoin.Currently, the chart shows a breakout from a downward trend just below the 29 mark, suggesting a possible shift away from Bitcoin dominance.

2025-05-10T14:00:00.000Z,"In volatile markets, RWAs like gold are a lifeline","Opinion by: Kevin Rusher, founder of RAACIt’s a volatile world out there. This year, we’ve seen stocks take a wild ride as gold has pumped and crypto has been caught somewhere in the middle. Investors have dumped risk assets and scrambled for safe havens. Gold is leading the charge.While gold is safe, it is not very hard-working. Unlike cash and treasuries, the yellow metal does not generate income. Now, more than ever, investors need to be able to earn yield on gold — particularly in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. The only way to make money from gold is to buy low and sell high. Most investors don’t tend to buy gold like this. That’s for good reason — over the long term, gold’s performance is typically consistent, if not without a few peaks and troughs here and there, as we have recently seen. For example, after the 2008 financial crisis, the price of gold soared 148% but stagnated for nearly a decade before the COVID-19 pandemic triggered another rally, and it's likely we will see gold hold, if not fall from it's new record high once markets revive. While it remains an excellent hedge, gold’s long-term track record is not a growth story.Investors prefer US Treasurys or high-yield savings accounts as part of a balanced portfolio. While gold may outperform these assets in uncertain times, it offers a better balance of security and predictable income over the long term. The DeFi solution This is where DeFi brings innovation to the world’s oldest asset. DeFi can significantly modernize gold investing, offering the speed and transparency of blockchain-based transactions and the ability to earn returns.Currently, though, most tokenized gold is much the same as holding it in an exchange-traded fund (ETF). Stablecoin giants like Tether and Paxos have launched gold-backed tokens, which they say are fully backed by physical, audited gold reserves, yet offer no yield.Recent: Bitcoin’s safe-haven appeal grows during trade war uncertaintyMost DeFi investors prefer liquid, tradable assets like cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, which can generate attractive returns. Many would rather, for example, buy Tether’s USDt (USDT) stablecoin and stake it, earning rewards while still maintaining ownership.Perhaps this is why the market capitalization of gold-backed tokens remains modest. Tether Gold, the world’s most significant gold token, has a market capitalization of just under $835 million, for example, while Paxos Gold sits at around $799 million. Combined, this is equivalent to just 1% of the market cap of USDT. Unlocking income from the world’s oldest asset To unlock gold’s full potential, we need to take tokenization a step further by creating a DeFi ecosystem where tokenized gold is actively put to work — borrowed, lent and integrated into yield-bearing strategies.One possibility is for companies such as gold miners is to issue tokenized versions of their reserves that can be turned into stablecoins that can then be staked to earn a yield. Leveraging protocols whose liquidity mechanisms enable the trading of stablecoins and real-world asset (RWA) tokens, holders could take advantage of further yield opportunities throughout the DeFi ecosystem.Beyond the benefits of yield opportunities, blockchain technology means investors in tokenized gold can benefit from the flexibility of 24-hour trading, near real-time price discovery and near-instant settlement without compromising the stability of the asset. The future of gold investingIt is, perhaps, ironic that — just as governments worldwide are starting to put their stamp of approval on digital finance — gold is becoming a highly desirable commodity again. The public’s interest in it will grow as governments essentially ratify digital finance. At the same time, the appetite for gold in these uncertain times will also increase. DeFi could bring these trends together and kickstart a natural evolution in gold ownership that provides a solid bridge between traditional and digital finance. While gold inside traditional markets attracts investors looking for stability, DeFi brings opportunities that don’t compromise that stability, as it presents new and unique yield opportunities. Gold has captivated humanity for thousands of years. It’s the foundation of myths, the standard of wealth and the ultimate hedge against uncertainty. But in today’s financial world, it needs an upgrade.Through integrating gold into the DeFi ecosystem, we could unlock its true potential — not just as a store of value but as an income-generating asset. The world’s oldest safe haven asset is finally on the brink of a digital evolution.Opinion by: Kevin Rusher, founder of RAAC.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-10T13:00:00.000Z,"4chan rises from the dead: How the imageboard moves crypto markets","After 4chan was hacked on April 14 and vast troves of user and moderator data were leaked online, the controversial website quickly went down, and many believed it would never recover. However, less than two weeks later, the imageboard was back online, defiant as ever.“4chan is back,” an official blog post proclaimed. “No other website can replace it, or this community. No matter how hard it is, we are not giving up.”The imageboard has left its mark on the world in many consequential ways, birthing countless memes and conspiracy theories, serving as a platform for political movements ranging from the alt-right to Anonymous, and acting as a dumping ground for leaks and hacks of all sorts. Crypto is no exception, with 4chan also a historically influential gathering place to share altcoin alpha, coordinate campaigns to pump tokens, share price prophesies and more.With the imageboard back from the dead, here are just a few of the ways it has influenced the crypto space during its storied history.Finding alpha on 4chan’s /Biz/ imageboardThe primary hub of crypto activity on 4chan is its /Biz/, or “Business & Finance,” imageboard, where traders, gamblers, investors and commentators gather to share info, shill tokens, and discuss the state of the crypto industry at large. The imageboard has gathered a reputation for being a place where intrepid investors can go to learn about moonshot tokens the broader community has yet to discover, though X and Telegram have since given 4chan a run for its money. It has also been ground zero for countless shilling campaigns that have helped pump prices for various tokens.A Reddit user shares some tokens they discovered early on, thanks to /Biz/. Source: Deleted Reddit account/Biz/ has also become known for the various prophecies, lore and legends that emerge from its anonymous users. People who claim to have inside knowledge on major market movements often leak alleged secret info on the imageboard or issue prophecies, and every once in a while, they actually turn out to be accurate.In January 2019, a user correctly predicted that Bitcoin (BTC) would hit $5,300 by April and $9,200 by July, sparking huge interest online. Unfortunately, their remaining price predictions quickly fell short of reality, including that Bitcoin would hit $87,000 by October 2020.Another user claimed in May 2021 to work at a Chinese firm that collaborated closely with the government and said they had insider information that Bitcoin would sell off due to major news out of China. A few hours later, reports emerged that China would ban payment companies and financial institutions from offering services related to crypto transactions, and Bitcoin sold off./Biz/ was also the source of a June 2017 rumor that Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin had died in a car crash. The fake news led to Ether’s (ETH) market cap crashing by $4 billion before Buterin stepped in to share that he had, in fact, not died.The fake news that Vitalik Buterin had died in a car crash started on /Biz/. Source: WarosuChainlink and the LINK MarinesPerhaps the most successful shilling campaign to come out of 4chan is that of Chainlink (LINK), which saw a massive rally that started in 2020 and continued into 2021. Many of the oracle project’s most diehard community members, known as the LINK Marines, first discovered Chainlink on /Biz/.Much of the excitement among the early Chainlink community was galvanized by a mysterious figure known as “AssBlaster,” who claimed to have insider knowledge about the project and would share alpha on /Biz/. Source: WarosuThe LINK Marines relentlessly promoted Chainlink on 4chan and social media platforms, and by 2020, LINK had experienced its first major rally — from $1.80 at the start of the year to a high of $16.64 on Aug. 12.Following the rally, Mechanism Capital co-founder Andrew Kang declared that “4chan has become the largest market driver” in crypto, “more powerful than even China or institutional crypto fund capital.”Related: Mechanism Capital founder doubles Bitcoin position with a $200M longLINK went on in 2021 to hit an all-time high of $49.54, becoming one of the year’s most talked-about crypto success stories.LINK’s price exploded to nearly $50 in 2021. Source: CoinMarketCapLINK Marine Albert Nazarov told Cointelegraph Magazine in March 2021 that “4chan is basically a crucible of raw thoughts; the best and balanced make it to the top. It’s almost anything goes there, and it trains the brain to decipher good info from bad stuff.”Chainlink remains the third most mentioned stock or cryptocurrency on /Biz/ over the last 24 hours as of the time of writing, behind only Bitcoin and Ether.Pepe the Frog and memes galoreOne of the most well-recognized memes associated with 4chan is Pepe the Frog, though its origins have nothing to do with the imageboard. Pepe was created by artist Matt Furie back in 2005 for a comic titled Boy’s Club.Over the next several years, Pepe was popularized by 4chan and eventually became a mainstream meme. But in 2015, posters from 4chan’s /R9k/ board decided to “reclaim” Pepe and began a campaign to intentionally associate it with the far right. Nevertheless, the frog remains a popular meme on 4chan and in crypto circles.In the cryptosphere, Pepe became closely associated with Chainlink. Sanctum CEO Tyler Ward, who sparked a Pepe non-fungible token (NFT) craze in 2021, told Magazine, “When Chainlink started doing well, it just became this cultish prophecy of 4chan, and 4chan really likes Pepe the frog, so it was kind of this merger.”“A lot of people that posted about Chainlink would post with Pepe the Frog, and they kind of became intertwined.”Crypto’s obsession with Pepe the Frog has since grown significantly beyond its early association with Chainlink. In 2023, the memecoin Pepe (PEPE), named after the frog, was launched and quickly became popular among traders. The token truly took off in 2024 amid the memecoin mania, going from a $591-million market cap at the start of the year to $11 billion by December, flipping Uniswap’s UNI (UNI) token.But Pepe is not the only 4chan meme to be tokenized and explode in price. Mog Coin (MOG), a memecoin based on the phrase “mogging” — dominating, outclassing or outshining others — gained 1,800% in early 2024. According to CoinGecko, 4chan-themed memecoins command a $37-billion market cap as of May 8.The popular phrase “we’re all gonna make it,” or WAGMI, was also popularized on 4chan. It was borrowed from Australian bodybuilder Aziz “Zyzz” Shavershian, who would frequently post on the Bodybuilding.com forum as well as 4chan’s fitness board and who passed away in 2011.
