Since then, SOL has struggled to stay above $180, but derivatives and onchain data still suggest further gains are in store.SOL/USD (blue) vs. altcoin market cap.

Source: DefiLlamaSolana’s $10.9 billion total value locked (TVL) surpasses the entire Ethereum layer-2 ecosystem, which includes Base, Arbitrum, and Avalanche. Even BNB Chain, which integrates seamlessly with Binance and Trust Wallet, cannot match Solana’s numbers. Notable 30-day TVL increases for Solana include Raydium DEX, up 78%, Jito liquid staking solution, up 41%, and Marinade, which gained 56%.Rising fee revenue boosts SOL demand and momentumGaining traction in decentralized finance (DeFi) does not always translate into demand for the native token, since some networks have extremely low fees. For example, over a recent 30-day period, the Ethereum network generated just $24.9 million in base layer fees, while Tron captured $51.9 million and Solana totaled $43.3 million, according to DefiLlama.Solana network DApps revenue (left) vs. chain fees (right). Source: DefiLlamaSolana’s DApps revenues and chain fees have shown consistent growth over the past four weeks. The latest figures are approaching their highest levels in three months, which is highly positive for SOL, as it drives demand. With 65% of the SOL supply involved in staking, this dynamic also supports upward price momentum.Related: Solana co-founder proposes meta chain to fix blockchain fragmentationTo gauge whether traders are becoming more optimistic about SOL’s price outlook, it is helpful to look at leverage demand.

Source: Laevitas.chCurrently, the SOL perpetual futures funding rate is at 8%, which falls within the neutral range of 5% to 10% based on the cost of capital. However, with SOL still trading 40% below its all-time high of $295 from Jan. 19, there is little reason for excessive optimism just yet. Still, the increasing activity on the Solana network suggests that SOL could reach $200 soon, potentially outperforming its competitors.The exact catalyst that could propel SOL’s price higher remains uncertain, but possibilities include the potential approval of a spot Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US, as well as Solana’s eventual inclusion in a state-level digital asset strategic reserve. Additionally, some analysts are optimistic about traditional asset tokenization on Solana, which could unlock further value for SOL.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-13T20:18:44.000Z,"What are the next steps for the US stablecoin bill?","Proponents of a bill to regulate stablecoins in the US Congress will likely take up another vote on the legislation in a matter of days without responding to concerns about President Donald Trump’s financial ties to the cryptocurrency industry.The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, or GENIUS Act, failed to get enough votes to pass in the US Senate on May 8 amid calls from some Democratic lawmakers to halt any legislation related to digital assets until Republicans could address Trump’s potential conflicts of interest. Immediately following the vote, some lawmakers from both parties suggested they could reconsider the bill as early as this week, but without agreeing on a bipartisan path forward.After the GENIUS Act failed to proceed in a 48 to 49 vote in the Senate, Majority Leader John Thune made a motion to reconsider, setting up a possible vote on the matter within days. A source familiar with the matter told Cointelegraph Republicans who backed the bill were unlikely to modify it to block Trump or any member of his administration from investing in digital assets, claiming it was beyond Congress’s authority under the Constitution.“[...] this delay is not inherently detrimental,“ said Liat Shetret, vice president of global policy and regulation at blockchain analytics firm Elliptic. “We can expect the bill to return to the floor, with this pause giving both parties time to clarify provisions and address lawmakers’ concerns.”The Cedar Innovation Foundation, an organization tied to the political action committee (PAC) Fairshake, issued a warning to Senate leadership to “avoid political games” and pass a stablecoin bill “in the coming days.” Fairshake spent more than $131 million to support candidates in the 2024 US elections, some of whom are currently serving in the House and Senate. There are still more than 500 days until the 2026 midterms, when many members of Congress are up for reelection.On May 12, the Senate resumed consideration of the motion to proceed to consideration of the GENIUS Act, suggesting another vote soon.Related: US Treasury Secretary expresses support for crypto bills at hearingChanges to stablecoin or market structure bills?Should Republicans in the Senate reintroduce the bill without any changes, it’s unclear whether they would have enough support to clear a 60-vote majority to avoid a Democratic filibuster — a process to delay or sometimes block a vote on a bill. The Trump family’s ties to the crypto platform World Liberty Financial and its stablecoin, USD1, have raised potential corruption concerns, as has offering the top holders of his TRUMP memecoin the chance to pay for access to the president through an exclusive dinner and reception. “[...] the Republicans’ bill did nothing to address Trump’s conflict, and instead voted to hand Trump the authority to write the rules over his and his competitors’ stablecoins,” said Democratic Representative Maxine Waters in a May 6 statement. She blocked a hearing to discuss a possible digital asset market structure bill, citing concerns about Trump’s “ownership of crypto.”Democratic lawmakers have already introduced possible solutions to what they called the “biggest corruption scandal in the history of the White House” — with legislation in the House and Senate to bar members of Congress, the president, the vice president, and their families from profiting off memecoins. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Chris Van Hollen also reportedly called on the president to fully divest from USD1 before making any possible deals with foreign governments.The nonpartisan organization State Democracy Defenders Action reported in April that Trump’s crypto holdings were worth roughly $2.9 billion, which accounted for 40% of his wealth. This report came before the launch of World Liberty Financial’s stablecoin, which an Abu Dhabi-based investment firm said it would use to settle a $2 billion investment in Binance.

2025-05-13T19:33:45.000Z,"Bitcoin is one rally away from new highs, but overly euphoric bulls signal ‘overheating’ market","Key takeaways:Bitcoin price maintains its bullish momentum, but a sentiment indicator suggests the market could be overheating. Data highlights Bitcoin traders taking profits and a lopsided market angled toward longs.Analysts warn of a potential short-term correction, especially if gold weakens or seasonal trends play out.Optimism has returned to the crypto markets, and many traders believe Bitcoin (BTC) price is on the path to new all-time highs. In just one month, Bitcoin surged 39%, briefly crossing the $105,000 mark. According to Glassnode analysts, “there are signs of renewed market strength, and the market is trading within a profit-dominated regime.”Still, not everyone is convinced the rally will continue unchecked. Some investors are already taking profits, pushing Bitcoin’s realized cap to an all-time high of $889 billion. Even more profit-taking is expected at the $106,000 level.Historically, euphoric market sentiment has often led to periods of consolidation—or even sharp corrections. That risk may be growing, particularly as gold, whose price action Bitcoin has closely mirrored in recent months, is showing signs of fatigue and could be heading for a correction itself.Most investors are back in profitThe recent Bitcoin rally has returned over 3 million BTC to a profitable state, according to Glassnode. This shift has reignited capital inflows, which exceeded $1 billion per day, suggesting strong demand-side interest and a market willing to absorb selling pressure. Even most short-term holders who were underwater since the December 2024 peak have seen their portfolios turn green.BTC short-term holders’ relative unrealized loss. Source: GlassnodeThis relief, both financial and psychological, is already translating into spending behavior. The net difference between short-term holders’ transfer volume in profit versus at a loss has swung sharply to +20%—a notable reversal from the -20% seen during the capitulation phase at the end of April.Institutional investor confidence is also rebounding. Over the past three weeks, more than $5.7 billion has flowed into Bitcoin ETFs, according to CoinGlass. The total assets under management held within the US spot ETFs have now climbed to over 1.26 million BTC, a new all-time high.Are crypto traders too euphoric right now?With so much momentum, it’s easy to imagine a moonshot. But that same momentum may be cause for caution. BTC’s open interest has climbed to $68 billion, near all-time highs, indicating a heavily positioned market. In such conditions, even a small catalyst could spark an outsized move—up or down.André Dragosch, head of research at Bitwise Asset Management, warned that Bitcoin might be getting a bit ahead of itself. He posted Bitwise’s in-house Cryptoasset Sentiment Index, which has reached its highest level since November 2024. The index, which includes 15 sub-indicators spanning sentiment, flows, onchain data, and derivatives (such as the perpetual funding rate and put-call volume ratio), now shows an overheated market.Bitcoin price vs Cryptoasset sentiment index. Source: BitwiseIn comments to Cointelegraph, Dragosch said,“The latest readings imply that market sentiment has become overheated and that positioning appears to be one-sided on the long side. It tends to signal an increased risk for a temporary pull-back in the price of Bitcoin, and that the current rally could take a break.”Yet, Dragosch remains “structurally constructive” until the end of 2025, citing the continued BTC accumulation by corporations and ETPs, which continues to deplete Bitcoin on-exchange balances.Related: Arizona governor kills two crypto bills, cracks down on Bitcoin ATMsPotential crypto market headwindsSeveral risks could challenge Bitcoin in the short term.For Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan, renewed regulatory uncertainty is a top concern, particularly after the Senate stalled stablecoin legislation last week.Broader shifts in market behavior may also be at play. Since March 2025, Bitcoin has shown a stronger correlation with gold than with equities. That shift followed dramatic changes in US policy, which appeared to steer capital toward politically neutral assets: both Bitcoin and gold rose 22% (the latter since corrected to a 13% gain). At the same time, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 merely clawed back earlier losses.BTC/USD vs gold, SPX, and NDX 1-day. Source: Marie Poteriaieva, TradingViewThis divergence continues on shorter time frames. Since May 12, major US indexes gained 3% to 4% on positive developments in US-China trade relations, but Bitcoin barely budged. Meanwhile, gold has started printing lower highs—a potential early signal of a downtrend, as noted by analyst Michael Van de Poppe. If gold enters a corrective phase, Bitcoin might follow suit.Seasonality may also play a role. The adage “Sell in May and go away” has some historical backing. As analyst Daan Crypto Trades noted, May has typically been a green month for Bitcoin (averaging over 8%), while June and September are often the worst-performing months. As he put it,“Seasonality is never something to solely base your decisions on, but it can work out well. Many investors are watching the same thing after all.”Whether this rally has more room to run—or is due for a breather—may soon be put to the test.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Complementing the recovery with a deeper analysis, crypto trader ZERO IKA observed that many altcoins have formed a higher time frame break of structure above their February and March highs. The analyst noted that despite recent upside, most altcoins remain 70% to 90% below their all-time highs, indicating a \""relatively early\"" opportunity for a recovery. The weakening stablecoin and Bitcoin dominance, coupled with a rise in altcoin market cap, opens the door for an altseason, as long as the above key trends remain intact.

2025-05-13T15:29:38.000Z,"How to use tsUSDe on TON for yield-generating dollar savings","Looking for a way to earn passive income on your crypto without riding the rollercoaster of volatile coins? TsUSDe (the staked version) on The Open Network (TON) might be the answer. It’s a dollar-pegged stablecoin that earns yield by design, and you can boost those earnings even more by putting it to work on platforms like STON.fi and DeDust.Here’s how it works and how to get started in just a few steps.What is tsUSDe, and why use it?TsUSDe is a US dollar-backed stablecoin on the TON blockchain. It’s designed to earn a base yield of around 10% APY, paid out in Toncoin (TON). That means just holding it in your wallet earns you rewards — no extra steps needed.But if you want to go a step further, you can use tsUSDe in liquidity pools or farms on TON-based platforms to unlock even more yield. It’s like putting your dollars to work while still staying in stable territory.Where to earn yield with tsUSDeRight now, two of the most active platforms for tsUSDe yield farming on TON are:STON.fi — known for smooth UX and deep liquidityDeDust — fast, lightweight and gaining traction fast.Both let you pair tsUSDe with TON and stake your position to earn trading fees plus additional farming rewards.Did you know? STON.fi has a built-in impermanent loss calculator to help you gauge risk before adding liquidity, while DeDust offers a full portfolio dashboard to track tokens, LPs and rewards in one place.Step-by-step: How to earn yield with tsUSDe1. Connect your walletGo to STON.fi or DeDust.io, connect your TON wallet, and make sure you have some TON in your balance to cover transaction fees.2. Pick a tsUSDe liquidity poolHead to the “Pools” or “Farms” section and find a tsUSDe/TON pool. You’ll see estimated APY numbers, which vary depending on trading volume and incentives. On STON.fi, for example, this pool sometimes hits 30%+ APY.3. Add liquidityClick “Add Liquidity,” then enter the amount of tsUSDe you want to supply. You’ll also need to supply the same dollar value in TON. Once confirmed, you’ll get LP (liquidity provider) tokens showing your share of the pool.4. Stake to boost rewardsNow, stake those LP tokens to earn extra farming rewards. On STON.fi, look for the “Farm” button next to your position. On DeDust, use the “Boost” feature. Once staked, you’ll start earning even more TON on top of trading fees.5. Monitor and claim rewardsYou can check your rewards anytime and claim them whenever you want.

2025-05-13T15:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin remains unmatched as a global inflation hedge","Opinion by: Jupiter Zheng, Partner Liquid Fund at HashKey CapitalWhenever Bitcoin falls in value, the narrative is always the same: It’s failing as a hedge against inflation. In the eyes of critics, Bitcoin is not the “digital gold” that so many others claim it to be.With gold hitting all-time highs, these critics have grown louder. If Bitcoin is an inflation hedge, they ask, why isn’t it also rallying as investors seek safety?Even in today’s bearish, high-inflation environment, the cardinal truth holds: Bitcoin is an inflation hedge — arguably the most important one for long-term capital preservation the world has seen. Strength in scarcityBitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million coins, with full circulation expected by 2140. This built-in scarcity mirrors gold, which has historically served as an inflation hedge. Bitcoin has outperformed gold during multiple periods, such as the COVID-19 era, when global markets were flooded with liquidity.Like gold, Bitcoin works as an inflation hedge over the long term, not the short term. Critics focus too much on short-term volatility and ignore broader trends. Bitcoin has consistently been used as a store of value during extended periods of money printing.Bitcoin is not controlled by any central bank or politician. It’s a decentralized, peer-to-peer system governed by math and consensus — not by election cycles or political pressure. In places like Zimbabwe or Venezuela, where governments destroyed their currencies, Bitcoin has offered a more stable alternative. When faith in traditional systems weakens, Bitcoin often strengthens. Consensus beats centralizationBitcoin’s value isn’t just in its price — it’s in its design. Countries like the US, EU, UAE, Singapore, and Hong Kong have advanced regulations around Bitcoin, but its relevance goes far beyond developed economies.Inflation is an inconvenience in wealthier countries — rising grocery bills and pricier eggs. In struggling economies, inflation can signal political and financial collapse. Bitcoin offers a way out. It’s not theoretical anymore — it’s happening in real life.During Greece’s 2015 crisis, citizens used Bitcoin to bypass capital controls. In Venezuela and Argentina, where national currencies lost most of their value, Bitcoin became a tool for survival. People used it to preserve wealth, access global markets, and transact on decentralized exchanges.Recent: Bitcoin may rival gold as inflation hedge over next decade — Adam BackBitcoin’s borderless, censorship-resistant nature is critical. It doesn’t rely on the decisions of any one institution. It’s protected from debt monetization, interest rate manipulation, and geopolitical pressures. Bitcoin runs on consensus, not command. Consensus matters most when trust in institutions is low. This immutability is a characteristic that investors are undervaluing — and may not appreciate until they need it the most. Portability is powerBitcoin’s resilience also matters in developed markets — especially when traditional systems fail. Banks can collapse. Stock markets can crash. Payment processors can go offline. Bitcoin doesn’t sleep. It runs 24/7, 365 days a year.During the Silicon Valley Bank collapse in March 2023, Bitcoin jumped 23% as investors sought safety outside the traditional banking system. Bitcoin’s availability and independence became its advantage.In a bank failure like Lehman Brothers in 2008, consumers can lose access to their funds for months or even years. Bitcoin, held in self-custody, remains in your control — as long as you have the private keys. No third party is needed.Payment networks like Visa or SWIFT can also become chokepoints — and targets for hackers who want to disrupt the global payments infrastructure. Bitcoin isn’t subject to those bottlenecks. Miners, not banks, verify it. While congestion can slow transactions, scaling solutions are evolving to improve speed and cost.Bitcoin’s digital nature makes it especially valuable during capital controls, inflation, or crisis. It’s hard to seize, devalue, or freeze — giving individuals more autonomy than traditional financial systems allow.A more nuanced term: speculative hedge  Based on these characteristics, Bitcoin is unmistakably a hedge against inflation. Maybe we need a better term for Bitcoin’s central role in our financial futures.A more precise term might be speculative hedge — it offers long-term protection thanks to scarcity, consensus and decentralization. Yet, adoption and price volatility are still hurdles to Bitcoin dethroning gold as a true global inflation hedge. Still, there are encouraging signs. Companies like Strategy, GameStop, Block and MassMutual have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a treasury strategy — with some estimates pointing to one in four companies in the S&P 500 following suit by 2030. More governments are exploring Bitcoin reserves.As a speculative hedge, Bitcoin shines during inflation, currency devaluation, or systemic instability. It’s not a cure-all. Its effectiveness depends on user education, internet access, and geopolitical context. If connectivity disappears entirely — say, during a nuclear war — there will be bigger problems than inflation.Bitcoin is best understood as a financial lifeboat. It’s not perfect. It takes effort to use it correctly. It’s a small measure of preparation for life’s unknowns. But when the ship starts sinking, you’ll wish you had one.Opinion by: Jupiter Zheng, Partner Liquid Fund at HashKey Capital.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-as-inflation-hedge?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-13T14:04:14.000Z,"Bitcoin builders defend role of venture capital in layer-2 growth","Venture capital firms remain critical to infrastructure development in the Bitcoin ecosystem, despite pushback from some in the community, according to builders speaking at the Token2049 conference in Dubai.Charlie Yechuan Hu, CEO of Bitcoin layer-2 protocol Bitlayer, shared his insights on venture capital (VC) firms in the Bitcoin (BTC) ecosystem.Hu told Cointelegraph that he views many VC firms in the space positively, as they offer support to early ventures that need capital to build infrastructure.“You need developers, you need to open up the whole ecosystem foundation, everything,” Hu said. “You need to pay for the cloud, like AWS or RPCs, all that, servers […] So, we have to have VC on that.“Hu argued against the usual Bitcoiner ethos that argues against outsider capital, saying, “It’s difficult to say, okay, let’s do a fair mint, and then have a very successful, healthy treasury, and you have to pay all this stuff.”“It doesn’t work that way,” he said.Related: StarkWare researchers propose smart contracts for Bitcoin with ColliderVMLightning-only stance sparks debateNot everyone agrees. Mike Jarmuz, a managing partner at Bitcoin venture capital firm Lightning Ventures, told Cointelegraph that Lightning is the only L2 his company has invested in and is interested in. He said, “Anything with a ‘token’ that allows for ‘staking’ and earning some absurd APY interest on your Bitcoin should be avoided.”Jarmuz said that Lightning Network, on the other hand, is growing very quickly and makes Bitcoin transactions instant, nearly free and scalable. Bitcoin Visuals data shows that the Lightning Network has a cumulative capacity across all channels equivalent to almost $452 million at the time of writing. He added:“There is no ‘token’ when using the Lightning network. It’s Bitcoin. That to me is the only real L2, at least as of right now.“Lightning Network capacity chart. Source: Bitcoin VisualsJarmuz said that projects not meeting his criteria are “masquerading as useful” while doing nothing for Bitcoin. He claimed that sidechains like the Liquid Network and newer protocols such as e-cash and federations or Ark “are not widely used” but “are at least interesting.” He recognized that those “do not involve a staked token, promising yield,” with projects that have those features, “just waiting for rug pulls and issues.”“We don’t invest in that area,“ he added.Related: Spar supermarket in Switzerland starts accepting Bitcoin paymentsVCs seen as enablers of Bitcoin growthAccording to Hu, VCs bring liquidity, resources and experience to new startups while opening “up all the institutional ideas and connections.” He said that those were important additions to Bitlayer’s resources as well, noting that “we wouldn’t have that if those people didn’t invest in us.”He also argued that VCs tend to back long-term infrastructure efforts rather than speculative projects like memecoins or non-fungible tokens.  That experience was echoed by Walter Maffione, lead engineer at Lightning Network-based decentralized exchange (DEX) Kaleidoswap, who told Cointelegraph that the protocol started as an open-source project and raised a pre-seed investment from Fulgur Ventures and Bitfinex Ventures.“Those funds were used to pay open-source developers and accelerate protocol development, not to build a token or capture governance rights,“ he said.Hu claimed that VCs have contributed significantly to developing layer-2 scalability solutions, wallets, Bitcoin lending and staking protocols. He added:“All of them are VC-backed, including us. And some of them are listed on top exchanges.”Vikash Singh, principal at Bitcoin VC firm Stillmark, told Cointelegraph that when selecting Bitcoin layer-2 protocols to invest in, they consider demonstrated security and robustness, proliferation and adoption of non-speculative use cases and growth of the application layer. Much like Jarmuz, he said that Stillmark believes that proof-of-work is the superior consensus model.Still, unlike Jarmuz, Singh said proof-of-stake or Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus “may be suitable for Bitcoin sidechains and rollups.”Magazine: ‘Bitcoin layer 2s’ aren’t really L2s at all: Here’s why that matters",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-builders-defend-vc-role-layer-two-development?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

However, its beta has declined, signaling that investors may be treating it less as a high-risk asset and more as a long-term allocation.“Bitcoin as a non-sovereign asset means an investor doesn’t need the full faith or tax basis of a nation to support the integrity of the asset,” said Chris Rhine, head of liquid active strategies at Galaxy.Galaxy said that the recent investor behavior mirrors what was observed during the 2018–2019 US-China trade tensions when Bitcoin rallied amid rising global uncertainty.Hank Huang, CEO of Kronos Research, told Cointelegraph that surging ETF inflows and Strategy’s ongoing Bitcoin purchases are helping reshape Bitcoin into a digital version of gold, less tied to equities.“As institutions deepen liquidity, volatility drops, making Bitcoin a cornerstone for portfolios,” Huang added.Meanwhile, Galaxy’s OTC trading desk said the market posture is “tactically cautious but structurally constructive,” marked by disciplined leverage and low hedging stress.With 95% of Bitcoin’s total supply already mined and growing interest from institutions, ETFs, and even governments, Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a digital store of value.“Bitcoin’s supply and demand dynamics are solidifying its place as a mature digital store of value,” said Ian Kolman, co-portfolio manager at Galaxy.On April 25, Jay Jacobs, BlackRock’s head of thematics and active ETFs, said there has been a long-term trend where countries have been reducing their reliance on dollar-based reserves in favor of assets like gold and, increasingly, Bitcoin.He noted that geopolitical fragmentation is fueling demand for uncorrelated assets, with Bitcoin increasingly viewed alongside gold as a safe-haven asset.Magazine: Bitcoin eyes’ crazy numbers,’ JD Vance set for Bitcoin talk: Hodler’s Digest, May 4 – 10",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-volatility-falls-below-sp500-nasdaq-galaxy-digital?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

The fund would have allowed Arizona to hold crypto assets obtained through seizures or legislative allocations.“Current volatility in cryptocurrency markets does not make a prudent fit for general fund dollars,” she stated in her veto letter. “I have already signed legislation this session which allows the state to utilize cryptocurrency without placing general fund dollars at risk,” she added.That decision followed her veto of Senate Bill 1025 — the more ambitious “Arizona Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act” — on May 3.

2025-05-13T08:40:00.000Z,"From Netflix series to crypto game: Black Mirror’s AI reputation system, explained","Black Mirror experience: When sci-fi social scores meet blockchain              Created by Charlie Brooker, this British sci-fi series debuted in 2011 and quickly became a cultural touchstone for its dark, satirical take on technology.Imagine a world where every like, comment and blockchain transaction shapes your social standing, where an AI watches your every digital move and assigns you a score that dictates your rewards or your restrictions. Sounds like something straight out of science fiction, right? Well, it is — until now. Black Mirror, Netflix’s chilling anthology series, and one of its most iconic concepts have inspired a real-world crypto game.Dubbed the Black Mirror Experience, this project brings the show’s AI-driven reputation system to life, blending dystopian storytelling with blockchain technology. If you haven’t seen Black Mirror, you must know that each standalone episode dives into a different scenario — think surveillance gone wild, social media obsession run amok or AI with a mind of its own. It’s not exactly feel-good TV, but it’s gripping, thought-provoking and often uncomfortably close to reality.The episode that sparked this crypto game is “Nosedive” from Season 3. Picture this: a pastel-colored world where everyone rates each other on a five-star scale after every interaction. Your average score isn’t just a badge of honor, but it determines your job prospects, housing options and even how people treat you. The protagonist, Lacie, spends her days chasing approval, plastering on a smile to boost her rating. It’s a biting critique of performative social media culture, and now, it’s the blueprint for a blockchain-based experiment.Did you know? Reputation systems predate AI and are rooted in human trust mechanisms like word-of-mouth and credit scores. The internet era introduced digital versions, such as eBay’s feedback system in the late 1990s, where buyers and sellers rated each other. These manual systems were simple but vulnerable to fake reviews and retaliation.                  How Black Mirror Experience works              Built on the KOR Protocol, this dystopian game uses AI to rate your social and blockchain activity, turning your digital behavior into real Web3 rewards or penalties.The Black Mirror Experience is built on a transparent and tamper-resistant system developed by major players in gaming and blockchain tech, including Animoca, Niantic and Avalanche.At its core is Iris, an AI virtual assistant that’s equal parts judge, jury and scorekeeper. To join the fun:You connect a compatible crypto wallet and your X account. From there, Iris gets to work, analyzing your online behavior, such as your posts, your follows and your blockchain moves, and assigns you a reputation score.This isn’t just a vanity metric; your score unlocks real perks in the Black Mirror universe, like token airdrops, early feature access and voting power in narrative-driven events.Lower scores?Well, you might find yourself locked out of the good stuff. Every user gets a Social ID Card and a non-fungible token (NFT) that logs your score and tracks your digital footprint over time. This NFT tracks behavior through digital badges — awarded for positive actions — and “stains,” which mark negative ones, creating a transparent audit trail readable by other applications. Beyond its role in the game, the Social ID Card doubles as a portable Web3 identity and onchain passport, allowing users to carry their reputation across the Black Mirror Web3 ecosystem. Iris evaluates a wide range of activities, from holding or trading tokens and NFTs to engaging with decentralized communities and posting on social media, distinguishing genuine contributors from trolls or scammers. But what powers this reputation system behind the scenes?Blockchain is the backbone here. Every action you take, whether it’s posting on X or trading tokens, gets recorded on the ledger. Your reputation score? Calculated by smart contracts, not controlled by a hidden authority.Did you know? The project has already gained traction, with over 13,000 reputation IDs claimed, signaling early interest.                  What’s the catch? Implications of the AI reputation system              A game where your online presence can earn you rewards sounds interesting. But, like any Black Mirror story, there’s a darker layer to consider.To start, Iris needs access to your data to function. That includes your social media activity and blockchain history. While the system claims to be “fair and transparent,” who’s overseeing it? How is the data stored? And what happens if it gets leaked or misused?Gamifying behavior might encourage a more positive digital environment, but it could also push people to curate their actions for approval, similar to Lacie’s forced smiles in “Nosedive.”The bigger concern is who decides what counts as “good” behavior. Algorithms can lack nuance, and if the system is biased, it could end up punishing users unfairly or reinforcing existing divides.And this isn’t just fiction. China’s social credit system, introduced in 2014, assesses citizens’ trustworthiness based on behaviors like paying taxes or purchasing domestic products. Positive actions can boost one’s score, while negative behaviors, such as committing crimes or making unfavorable statements about the government, can lower it. Consequences for low scores include reduced access to credit and fewer business opportunities.The Black Mirror Experience may be a game, but it hints at how reputation tech could shape the future.Did you know? Nosedive isn’t the only Black Mirror episode to explore reputation systems. Hated in the Nation also showed how social media can become a weapon.                   Risks every Black Mirror Experience game player should know              While the Black Mirror Experience offers a thrilling dive into a dystopian world, blending cutting-edge tech with Black Mirror’s signature unease, it’s not without its risks. Data privacy concerns: Your personal information, including social media activity and blockchain transactions, could be vulnerable to leaks or misuse. Even with blockchain’s security, no system is entirely hack-proof.AI bias: Iris, the AI, might misinterpret your actions, leading to unfair reputation scores. This could lock you out of rewards or tarnish your digital identity without a clear way to appeal.Performative behavior: The game’s reward system might encourage users to act in ways that boost their scores rather than being authentic. This could create a culture of fake positivity, mirroring the dystopian themes of Black Mirror.Psychological stress: Constantly being rated and ranked can take a toll on mental health, leading to anxiety or obsession over your score. The pressure to maintain a high reputation could spill over into real life, blurring the lines between game and reality.Normalization of dystopian systems: By gamifying a reputation system, the project risks making such concepts seem normal or even desirable. This could desensitize users to the potential dangers of real-world social credit systems.That said, it’s important to remember that the Black Mirror Experience is a bold experiment. It’s pushing boundaries, merging entertainment with Web3 in ways we’ve never seen. The risks are real, but so is the innovation. As with any tech that blurs the line between fiction and reality, the key is to stay aware and maybe watch your score, but don’t let it rule you.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/from-netflix-series-to-crypto-game-black-mirrors-ai-reputation-system-explained?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Siu said this regulatory hostility stifled innovation and discouraged overseas companies from entering the US market.In contrast, Trump’s return to office has been accompanied by pledges to support the crypto sector and a rollback of enforcement activity. Siu described this as “a unique moment in time,” adding that not taking advantage of it “would be one heck of a wasted opportunity.”Since Trump’s election victory, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has dropped or paused over a dozen enforcement cases against crypto companies.Additionally, the Department of Justice recently announced the dissolution of its cryptocurrency enforcement unit, signaling a softer approach to the sector.This hands-on approach appears to be boosting industry confidence. OKX, for example, has announced plans to establish a US headquarters in San Jose, California, just months after settling a $504 million case with US authorities.On April 28, Nexo, which left the US at the end of 2022, citing a lack of regulatory clarity, revealed that it is reentering the US market.Magazine: Bitcoin eyes ‘crazy numbers,’ JD Vance set for Bitcoin talk: Hodler’s Digest, May 4 – 10",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/animoca-brands-new-york-listing-trump-crypto-push?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

But the court found, for a start, that claims of securities law violations couldn’t stand as it wasn’t alleged that his JENNER buys took place in the US, as the law requires, and gave “scant details” about the purchases.The court didn’t allow the class to swap its lead for a US-based member, adding it must report by May 16 on how the suit will proceed (highlights added for emphasis). Source: PACERCourt dismisses all claims by JENNER tokenholdersIn all, Judge Blumenfeld dismissed a further eight claims the class group brought in an amended complaint filed in February, which included accusations that Jenner and Hutchins either made misleading statements, sold unregistered securities, or committed various fraud.Judge Blumenfeld said the suit failed to allege that Jenner sold the token through a prospectus that contained an untrue statement, as “Greenfield admits that the $JENNER tokens were not sold through a prospectus.”The court also tossed a common-law fraud accusation, saying the complaint alleged omitted information and noted various X posts by Jenner “stating that she would continue to support the tokens,” but it did not identify which of the statements related to the fraud claim.The group also accused Hutchins of aiding and abetting Jenner’s allegedly fraudulent conduct, but Judge Blumenfeld said that claim failed as the complaint “does not adequately allege any viable fraud claim.”In a footnote, Judge Blumenfeld said Jenner and the class group disputed whether the JENNER token was a security, but he was not going to decide at this stage as the “securities claims fail on other grounds.”Related: Top TRUMP whales hold $174M in tokens ahead of dinner with US president “Because the determination of whether the tokens are securities is fact-dependent and may be affected by an amended pleading, the Court declines to resolve that issue at this stage and instead assumes without deciding that the tokens are securities subject to the federal securities laws,” he wrote.JENNER first launched in May 2024 via Pump.fun on the Solana blockchain but was soon embroiled in controversy after Jenner and other memecoin launching celebrities claimed collaborator Sahil Arora scammed them. Jenner relaunched the token on Ethereum, which the class group claimed tanked the value of the original Solana token, but gave Jenner the benefit of collecting a 3% fee on every transaction.JENNER has lost essentially all its value since launch. CoinGecko shows its market value has crashed to around $58,775 from a June 3 peak of nearly $7.5 million.

According to CoinGecko, DOGE recorded $4.7 billion in trading volume over the past 24 hours, ranking fifth among the top cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins). The memecoin’s market strength has been coupled with strong onchain insights. Data from CryptoQuant noted that DOGE’s spot taker 90-day cumulative volume delta (CVD), which measures the net difference between buying and selling volume over 90 days, has been \""taker buyer dominant.” It indicates more aggressive buying than selling, a pattern last seen in November 2024, leading to DOGE’s breakout rally of 385% to $0.48 in Q4, 2024. DOGE spot taker CVD.

A NUPL above 0.5 means most holders are in profit, signaling confidence and a reduced likelihood of selling. This optimism reinforces price stability, as holders could refrain from selling and hold out for higher gains. The above metrics suggest strong market demand, with investors actively accumulating Dogecoin, which likely contributed to its recent gains. DOGE long-term holder NUPL.

A DNS works like a directory that translates domain names into IP addresses. Source: Curve FinanceThe team also said in another update that the “Password is secure,” its two-factor authentication was set up a “long time ago,” and a question has been sent to the “registrar now.””While all smart contracts are safe, the domain name points to a malicious site which can drain your wallet! We are investigating and working on recovering the access. No sign of a compromise on our side,” Curve said. Curve Finance was hit with a similar front end attack in August 2022. In a post-mortem,  the consensus was that the attackers managed to clone the Curve Finance website and reroute the DNS server to the fake page.Users who attempted to use the platform had their funds drained into a pool operated by the attackers.Cointelegraph has contacted Curve Finance for comment. Curve Finance potential front-end attackOnchain security firm Blockaid also detected unusual activity from the Curve website recently, warning users to stay away and avoid interacting for now.It could be a case of a “potential frontend attack,” according to the security firm, which is when hackers target the part of the website users interact with, such as the buttons, forms, or text on the site, to steal sensitive data.Source: Blockaid“If you’re connected, please refrain from signing transactions and avoid interactions with the DApp until the issue is resolved.

Ether and its staking derivatives make up nearly half of Aave’s TVL, according to data from DefiLlama. This time around, Aave’s all-time high TVL is also driven by inflows of deposits by users. In Ether-denominated terms, Aave’s TVL rose from around 6 million ETH at the start of 2025 to nearly 10 million ETH on May 12.

Many of the “mugshot” attendees publicly shared their identities on social media ahead of and during the event, but at the time of publication, no one appeared to be claiming they would apply for the memecoin dinner.

The fake announcement, which shook markets in the roughly 24 hours before the regulator actually approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, led to the arrest of Council.“This case deserves a guidelines range prison sentence,” said US prosecutors. “Defendant profited through a sophisticated fraud scheme involving fraudulently produced identification documents, a series of misrepresentations at telecommunication stores, and the transmission of password reset codes for victim online accounts to co-conspirators located in the United States and abroad.

Instead, the Commission will utilize its existing rulemaking, interpretive, and exemptive authorities to set fit-for-purpose standards for market participants.”Source: U.S. Securities and Exchange CommissionA key priority will be to “develop a rational regulatory framework for crypto asset markets that establishes clear rules of the road for the issuance, custody, and trading of crypto assets while continuing to discourage bad actors from violating the law.”In particular, Atkins said the SEC would focus on establishing “clear and sensible guidelines” for crypto assets that could be considered securities. Another area of focus would be to allow brokers to offer a broader range of investment products on their platforms, which in some cases may mix securities and non-securities.Atkins’ approach moves away from former SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s, whose tenure was criticized by some industry participants for its “regulation by enforcement” method of oversight.Securities evolutionAtkins likened the tokenization of securities to the evolution of audio formats — from vinyl to cassettes to digital software — highlighting how each shift enhanced compatibility and interoperability across a wide range of devices and applications.

2025-05-12T19:50:58.000Z,"Bitcoin price sells off after Trump’s US-China tariff deal — Here is why","Key takeaways:Bitcoin lags as investors shift toward stocks after the US and China strike a deal that could end the current trade war.Macroeconomic conditions are swinging away from gold investing and back to stocks. Bitcoin (BTC) reached its highest price in over three months at $105,720 on May 12, but was unable to maintain its bullish momentum. Interestingly, the drop to $102,000 came after a temporary easing in the US-China tariff conflict. This has left traders puzzled as to why Bitcoin reacted negatively to what seemed like positive developments.The 90-day truce reduced import tariffs, and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted that the agreement could be extended, provided there is a genuine effort and constructive dialogue. According to Yahoo Finance, the topics under discussion include “currency manipulation,” “steel price dumping,” and restrictions on semiconductor exports.Bitcoin/USD (orange) vs. S&P 500 futures (red) and gold (blue). Source: TradingView / CointelegraphPart of Bitcoin’s recent lack of momentum can be attributed to its 24% gains over the previous 30 days, during which S&P 500 futures rose 7% and gold remained flat. Investors see little reason for further divergence between Bitcoin and traditional markets, especially since the 30-day correlation with the stock market remains high at 83%. Additionally, Bitcoin has now surpassed the market capitalization of both silver and Google, making it the world’s sixth-largest tradable asset.World’s largest tradable assets, USD. Source: 8marketcapNews that Strategy acquired another 13,390 BTC between May 5 and May 11 has also raised concerns among investors. With BlackRock and Strategy together holding 1.19 million BTC, about 6% of the circulating supply, some traders worry that Michael Saylor’s company is largely responsible for supporting the price.Critics, such as Peter Schiff, predict that Strategy’s ever-increasing average purchase price could eventually lead to losses and force the company to sell some of its holdings to cover borrowing costs. However, this scenario seems unlikely, as the company has doubled its capital increase limit by $21 billion in stocks and another $21 billion in debt.Bitcoin stalls as macroeconomic events favor stocks over goldWhile traders often focus on Bitcoin-specific events, the most likely reason for the weakness near $105,000 is broader macroeconomic conditions. Although the pause in tariffs directly benefits the stock market, the effect on scarce assets like Bitcoin is somewhat negative. For example, gold fell 3.4% on May 12 as the demand for safe-haven assets declined.Gold/USD (left) vs. DXY US Dollar Index (right). Source: TradingView / CointelegraphGold has typically shown an inverse correlation with the US Dollar Index (DXY), which climbed to its highest level in 30 days on May 12. The strengthening US dollar signals investor confidence, despite a 0.3% decline in US first-quarter Gross Domestic Product and a 6.1% jump in pending home sales in March compared to the previous month.Related: Bitcoin short-term ‘technical sell-off’ under $100K possible ahead of May 13 CPI printThe lack of conviction among Bitcoin investors when prices traded near $105,000 is at least partly due to reduced demand for scarce assets, as investors view the stock market as a more immediate and direct beneficiary of the US-China trade deal. Lower import duties suggest higher revenues and potentially improved profit margins for companies.Given the impressive $2 billion in inflows into US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) between May 1 and May 9, the likelihood of a price drop below $100,000 remains low. The steady demand for Bitcoin following a 24% monthly gain points to institutional adoption rather than retail-driven FOMO, which is a very positive sign for the price.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The revised version addressed potential risks to the integrity of the Bitcoin network posed by quantum computing, the filing shows.“[I]f quantum computing technology is able to advance […] it could potentially undermine the viability of many of the cryptographic algorithms used across the world’s information technology infrastructure, including the cryptographic algorithms used for digital assets like bitcoin,” BlackRock said. It is the first time the asset manager has explicitly flagged this risk in its IBIT disclosures. The IBIT ETF is the largest spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF, with approximately $64 billion in net assets, according to its website. Quantum computing is an emergent field that seeks to use the principles of quantum mechanics to greatly enhance computers’ processing capabilities. Source: James Seyffart/Bloomberg Intelligence Related: Quantum computing will bring lost Bitcoin 'back in circulation’ — Tether CEORecord-breaking inflowsJames Seyffart, an analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, cautioned that risk disclosures such as IBIT’s are required to highlight every possible risk to an asset, even those that are extremely unlikely. “They are going to highlight any potential thing that can go wrong with any product they list or underlying asset that’s being invested in,” Seyffart said in a May 9 X post. “It's completely standard.

Bitcoin market structure and qualitative fundamentals remain bullish, suggesting today’s correction could be short-lived.Bitcoin (BTC) price briefly stumbled on May 12, falling to $102,388 after hitting an intraday high at $105,819 during the US trading session. At first glance, the abrupt correction seemed unexpected given the positive news of the day. Since Sunday evening (May 11), mainstream media headlines have reported on the positive headway made in the US-China trade talks occurring in Switzerland, and throughout the evening, President Trump ran his victory lab via Truth Social posts heralding the positives of the deal. BREAKING: U.S. Announces China Trade Deal in Geneva pic.twitter.com/JjgvYAvAGe— The White House (@WhiteHouse) May 11, 2025As news of the tentative deal broke, US equity futures markets soared, and these gains materialized into a 1,000-point rally in the Dow at the opening bell. Looking beyond the temporary resolution of the US-China trade war, Bitcoin has racked up back-to-back wins over the past two weeks. On May 12, Strategy CEO Michael Saylor announced that the company had acquired 13,390 Bitcoin, bringing its total balance to 568,840 BTC. On the same day, shares of healthcare company KindlyMD surged up to 600% after announcing the merger with Nakamoto Holdings, a Bitcoin investment company founded by David Bailey, who is Trump’s current crypto adviser. The month of April followed a similar trajectory to today, where frequent Bitcoin treasury creation announcements were made by an assortment of US-based and international companies. Related: US real estate asset manager launches $100M tokenized fund with institutional backingProfit taking and de-risking drive the current Bitcoin price correctionWhile Bitcoin's mass adoption appears to be accelerating, data from Glassnode suggests that BTC price could be in for a brief period of consolidation after gaining 9% in the last week. The onchain analytics firm posted the following chart and warned that: “BTC Supply Mapping shows sustained strength in new demand. First-Time Buyers RSI has held at 100 all week. But Momentum Buyers remain weak (RSI ~11), and Profit Takers are rising. If fresh inflows slow, lack of follow-through could lead to consolidation.” At major crypto exchanges, there was an uptick in selling in perpetual futures markets, and selling was also seen in spot markets as BTC price rallied into a sell wall near $106,000. From a trader's point of view, a portion of the selling could be possible derisking ahead of the May 13 Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation report, along with the view that the Trump trade deal with China is now priced in after BTC failed to rally and hold above $104,000 on such momentous news. BTC/USD spot and futures CVD. Source: TRDR.io Leading into the trade war news, the US Dollar Index (DXY) rallied and stock indexes soared. Seeing Bitcoin failing to break and hold $104,000 to $105,000 prior to stock futures opening and then BTC being unable to follow equities opening bell gains in the NY session suggests some traders elected to close profitable longs ahead of tomorrow’s CPI or before the current bid appetite shifts to lower price levels. BTC/USDT futures 1-hour chart. Source: VeloThis view can be interpreted by the chart above, showing open interest rising hour-over-hour, along with an abrupt spike in the funding rate as short positions opened and longs were liquidated. Spot purchasing played a significant role in last week’s Bitcoin price rally, and the May 12 announcement from Strategy and spot BTC ETF inflows of the past 7 days raises more immediate concerns of whether the type of buying appetite seen since late April will spill over into another week. Spot Bitcoin ETF net inflows (weekly). Source: SoSoValueConsidering the accelerating pace of Bitcoin adoption within traditional finance and the rapidly improving crypto regulatory environment, the current price action appears to be a short-term technical correction.

Initially, the company said that $25 million of the $100 million allocation would be tokenized on Chintai. According to PREH, the tokenization structure helps alleviate many transparency and liquidity constraints investors typically face in private market placements.Founded in 2010, PREH is a national real estate asset manager that oversees a portfolio of Class A multifamily properties. The company owns and operates real estate investments, overseeing the acquisition, financing and management of properties. Since its inception, PREH has completed more than $500 million in real estate transactions.Chintai is a tokenization-focused layer-1 blockchain that also powers the R3 Sustainability Fund for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing.

2025-05-12T15:00:00.000Z,"Will Bitcoin hodlers be the reason more countries adopt wealth taxes?","Opinion by: Robin Singh, CEO of KoinlyIs there a catch for Bitcoin hodlers, with the asset’s price up over 600,000% since the beginning of 2013? Perhaps — if governments keep waking up to Bitcoin’s value, the whole “you only pay tax when you sell” mantra could soon be a thing of the past.What if a wealth tax is the answer for revenue-hungry tax agencies with no time to lose? It’s a yearly tax on a person’s total net worth — cash, investments, property and other assets — minus any debts, applied whether or not those assets are sold or generating income. The idea is to boost public revenue and curb inequality, mainly by taxing the ultra-rich. A wealth tax takes a clip off what you own, not what you earn.Countries such as Belgium, Norway and Switzerland have had wealth taxes baked into their tax systems for ages, yet some of the world’s biggest economies — like the US, Australia and France — have largely steered clear. That might be changing. More governments are eyeing wealth taxes for crypto. In December 2024, French Senator Sylvie Vermeillet took it a step further, suggesting Bitcoin (BTC) be labeled “unproductive,” which would mean taxing its gains every year — whether or not it’s ever sold. Yep, every asset holder’s favorite word is unrealized capital gains tax. It would be naive to assume other countries are not thinking about the same idea. With Bitcoin’s significant gains and industry executives such as ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood eyeing a $1.5-million price tag by 2030, I’d bet a magic 8-ball would say, “Signs point to yes.”The growing global interest in wealth taxIt might seem far-fetched, but it is hard to ignore the gains. The average long-term Bitcoin holder is already sitting on significant profits.The incentive is obvious. Switzerland’s wealth tax goes up to 1% of a portfolio’s value, and governments know there is plenty to collect.Countries catch on — sooner or later. Consider how capital gains tax became the norm.The US introduced capital gains tax in 1913, the UK jumped on board 52 years later in 1965, and Australia followed in 1985. Governments likely considering the wealth taxGovernments are likely entertaining the idea — whether they admit it or not. If any country seriously considers it, Germany could be a prime candidate, even though it scrapped its wealth tax back in 1997.Recent: Ukraine floats 23% tax on some crypto income, exemptions for stablecoinsIn July 2024, offloading 50,000 seized BTC at $58,000 might have seemed like a smart move for the German government, but when Bitcoin hit $100,000 just months later in December, it became clear they left a fortune on the table. In retrospect, a costly mistake…Will this be remembered as a blunder on par with Gordon Brown selling half of the UK’s gold reserves at $275 an ounce? Imposing such a rule on the wealthy comes with obvious risks.To understand the real effect of taxation on a country, just follow the money — specifically, where millionaires are moving. Recent data shows that high-net-worth individuals are leaving countries like the United Kingdom in droves, heading for tax-friendly havens like Dubai.The potential repercussions of a wealth taxWill nations risk losing these individuals to tap into unrealized gains on Bitcoin and other assets?Bitcoin is volatile and full of unknowns. While some events could lead to massive losses, governments may still push forward with policies that ultimately drive away millionaires, only to realize the trade-off wasn’t worth it. Conversely, US President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve — a clear nod to the hodl mentality. No doubt, this has other nations considering a similar move.If nations are embracing the hodl mindset, could that mean wealth taxes are off the table in those countries? Only time will tell.One thing is sure: Bitcoin hodlers have amassed enough wealth to put themselves on the radar of tax authorities. Whether this sparks fundamental policy changes or just political grandstanding, the crypto community won’t sit back quietly.Opinion by: Robin Singh, CEO of Koinly.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Speaking at a news conference in Geneva, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said both governments are aligned on avoiding further economic decoupling.  “The consensus from both delegations is neither side wants to be decoupled,” Bessent said. “What has occurred with these very high tariffs was an equivalent of an embargo, and neither side wants that. We do want trade. We want more balance in trade.”Joint statement on US-China meeting in Geneva. Source: The White HouseRelated: Bitcoin treasury firms driving $200T hyperbitcoinization — Adam BackThe constructive tone of the negotiations, along with the 90-day suspension of additional tariffs, removes the risk of “sudden re-escalation,” which may help altcoins and traditional stock markets follow Bitcoin’s (BTC) price recovery, according to Aurelie Barthere, principal research analyst at crypto intelligence platform Nansen.“Bitcoin is already trading close to its all-time highs,” Barthere told Cointelegraph. “However, with the latest easing in trade tensions, it now appears that altcoins, US equities, and the US Dollar Index (DXY) are well-positioned for a catch-up rally.”She noted that Bitcoin has outperformed risk assets in recent months due to its insulation from tariff-related risks.“I also expect the US dollar to perform strongly against prior safe-haven currencies such as the euro, Swiss franc and Japanese yen, reflecting improved global risk sentiment,” Barthere added.Nansen previously predicted a 70% chance for crypto and stocks to find their bottom by June, with their price recovery depending on the outcome of trade negotiations.Related: Bitcoin ETFs, gov’t adoption to drive BTC to $1M by 2029: Finance RedefinedTax relief could amplify rallyBitcoin is currently 4.8% away from recapturing its all-time high of over $109,800 recorded in January 2025, Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows.BTC/USD, 1-year chart.

The constructive trade negotiations, paired with emerging technical chart patterns, have spurred analyst calls for a Bitcoin rally to $150,000, depending on the outcome of an emerging bull flag pattern on the weekly chart.Magazine: Altcoin season to hit in Q2?
