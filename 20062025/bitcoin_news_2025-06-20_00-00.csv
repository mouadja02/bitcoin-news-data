2025-06-19T21:50:38,"Japanese Retailer Mac House Makes Bold $12M Crypto Investment Move","BitcoinWorld Japanese Retailer Mac House Makes Bold $12M Crypto Investment Move In a move signaling a growing convergence between traditional industries and the digital asset space, Japanese apparel retailer Mac House has announced a significant foray into the world of cryptocurrencies. The company revealed on June 19 its intention to allocate a substantial portion of recently raised capital – up to 1.715 billion yen, equivalent to approximately $12 million – towards investments in digital assets, prominently featuring Bitcoin. This strategic decision, reported by CoinDesk Japan, highlights an increasing willingness among established businesses to explore the potential of cryptocurrencies beyond just payment solutions. Why is a Japanese Retailer Venturing into Crypto? The decision by a traditional Japanese retailer like Mac House to invest millions in cryptocurrencies might seem unconventional at first glance. However, it reflects several potential strategic considerations that businesses globally are beginning to evaluate in the current economic climate. Here are some key reasons why a company might make such a move: Balance Sheet Diversification: Companies often seek ways to diversify their corporate treasury holdings beyond traditional cash, bonds, and equities. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are seen by some as a new asset class offering potential uncorrelated returns, although this comes with significant risk. Inflation Hedge Potential: With global economic uncertainties and inflationary pressures, some corporations view assets like Bitcoin as a potential store of value or a hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Potential for Growth: The cryptocurrency market, despite its volatility, has demonstrated periods of explosive growth. Investing in these assets offers the potential for capital appreciation, which could enhance the company’s financial position. Future Readiness: Investing in and understanding digital assets positions the company to potentially engage with the crypto economy in other ways in the future, such as accepting crypto payments or exploring Web3 technologies. For Mac House, this move indicates a forward-thinking approach, acknowledging the evolving financial landscape and seeking new avenues for growth and asset management. Mac House ‘s Strategic Vision: The New Digital Asset Group To effectively manage this new venture into digital assets, Mac House is undertaking an internal reorganization. A critical part of this plan is the establishment of a dedicated “Digital Asset Management Group” within its corporate division. This is a crucial step, as it acknowledges the specialized knowledge and infrastructure required to handle cryptocurrency investments. The responsibilities of this new group are set to be comprehensive: Overseeing Investments: Managing the portfolio of digital assets and potentially other equity investments. Risk Management: Identifying, assessing, and mitigating the unique risks associated with volatile assets like cryptocurrencies, including market risk, operational risk, and regulatory risk. Market Analysis: Monitoring market trends, evaluating potential investment opportunities, and making informed decisions regarding the allocation of funds within the digital asset space. Compliance: Ensuring all investment activities comply with relevant financial regulations in Japan and other applicable jurisdictions. The creation of a specific group underscores that this is not a casual allocation but a calculated strategic initiative requiring dedicated expertise and governance. Breaking Down the $12M Crypto Investment Plan The core of Mac House’s announcement is the allocation of up to 1.715 billion yen ($12 million) for crypto investment . This funding comes from a third-party allotment of stock options, indicating that the company specifically raised capital with this strategic purpose in mind, or is redirecting funds obtained through this method towards this goal. While the announcement mentions investing in cryptocurrencies “including Bitcoin,” it suggests that other digital assets may also be considered for the portfolio. The exact breakdown of the $12 million allocation across different cryptocurrencies has not been publicly detailed, but the specific mention of Bitcoin is significant. Bitcoin is often the first and primary digital asset considered by corporations due to its liquidity, market capitalization, and recognition as a foundational cryptocurrency. A $12 million investment is a substantial amount for a retailer, representing a meaningful commitment of capital to this new asset class. It signals serious intent and positions Mac House among a growing list of traditional companies exploring digital assets for their balance sheets. What This Means for Bitcoin Investment and the Market Mac House’s plan for Bitcoin investment and other cryptocurrencies is another data point supporting the trend of increasing institutional interest. While individual investors have long been active in the crypto market, participation from publicly traded companies, especially outside the tech or finance sectors, lends further legitimacy to the asset class. Every instance of a known company allocating capital to Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies contributes to what is often referred to as “institutional adoption.” This trend is important for several reasons: Increased Capital Inflow: Corporate investments bring significant capital into the market, potentially influencing liquidity and market dynamics. Validation: When established companies invest, it can signal to other businesses and the wider public that digital assets are becoming a more accepted and viable part of the financial ecosystem. Infrastructure Development: Institutional participation often drives the development of more robust and regulated infrastructure for trading, custody, and managing digital assets. While $12 million is not on the scale of investments made by companies like MicroStrategy or Tesla at their peak crypto holdings, it is a notable amount for a retail company and contributes to the overall narrative of traditional finance and business intersecting with the crypto world. Navigating the Path of Institutional Crypto Adoption The path of institutional crypto adoption is not without its challenges and risks. Mac House, like any company venturing into this space, will need to carefully navigate a complex environment. Key challenges include: Challenge Description Relevance for Mac House Market Volatility Cryptocurrency prices can experience rapid and significant fluctuations, impacting the value of the investment portfolio. Potential for substantial gains or losses on the $12M investment, affecting the company’s financial statements. Regulatory Uncertainty The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, including in Japan. Changes could impact the legality or taxation of holdings. Need for the Digital Asset Management Group to stay updated on and comply with all relevant laws and regulations. Security Risks Storing and managing digital assets securely requires specialized knowledge and infrastructure to prevent hacks or loss of private keys. Requires robust security protocols and expertise within the new management group. Accounting and Reporting Accounting rules for digital assets are still developing, making reporting their value and changes complex. Needs clear internal procedures and potentially external expertise for financial reporting. Public Perception Investor and customer views on cryptocurrency can vary, potentially impacting the company’s brand image. Requires clear communication about the rationale and management of the investment. Mac House’s decision to create a dedicated management group indicates they are taking these risks seriously and putting structures in place to mitigate them. This is a crucial step for any company considering institutional crypto adoption. Actionable Insights for Businesses and Investors What can other businesses and investors learn from Mac House’s move? For Businesses Considering Crypto: This example shows that companies outside the traditional finance/tech sector are exploring crypto. It highlights the need for a clear strategy, dedicated resources (like Mac House’s new group), and a thorough understanding of the risks involved before committing capital. Diversification and potential future engagement with the crypto economy are key drivers. For Crypto Investors: Each instance of institutional adoption, like Mac House’s $12M plan, adds another layer of legitimacy to the market. While individual corporate investments may not drastically move the market on their own, the cumulative effect of increasing corporate interest can be a positive long-term signal for the asset class. It suggests that the utility and value proposition of assets like Bitcoin are being recognized by a wider range of entities. Summary Japanese retailer Mac House is making a bold strategic pivot by planning to invest up to $12 million in cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, funded by a recent capital raise. This move is supported by the creation of a new Digital Asset Management Group tasked with overseeing these investments and managing associated risks. Mac House’s decision underscores the increasing trend of institutional crypto adoption, as companies look to digital assets for potential diversification, growth, and as a hedge against economic uncertainty. While significant risks like market volatility and regulatory complexity exist, the establishment of a dedicated internal group suggests Mac House is approaching this venture with careful consideration and a long-term perspective. This development serves as another example of how traditional industries are beginning to integrate with the evolving world of digital finance, potentially paving the way for more companies to explore similar strategies in the future.

2025-06-19T21:40:52,"Soaring Corporate Crypto Adoption Reveals Unexpected Market Strength","BitcoinWorld Soaring Corporate Crypto Adoption Reveals Unexpected Market Strength Are concerns about the crypto market hitting a wall overblown? Recent trends in public companies crypto strategies suggest this might be the case. A notable surge in publicly traded firms adding digital assets to their balance sheets indicates a deeper, more structural commitment than seen in previous cycles, hinting that fears of an imminent, devastating bubble burst might be exaggerated. Why is Corporate Crypto Adoption Gaining Momentum? The shift towards corporate crypto adoption is becoming a significant factor in the digital asset landscape. According to a report cited by The Block, Presto Head of Research Peter Chung highlights that the growing number of public companies accumulating crypto for their strategic reserves is a key indicator against widespread market collapse fears. While the rapid growth of crypto fund managers and their leveraged positions *could* pose risks in a bear market, potentially sparking forced liquidations, Chung views these risks as more manageable compared to the catalysts behind past market downturns, such as the collapse of the Terra ecosystem or the implosion of Three Arrows Capital (3AC). This growing trend isn’t just about speculation; it’s about companies integrating digital assets into their long-term financial planning. They are building crypto strategic reserves , treating assets like Bitcoin not just as volatile trading instruments but as potential hedges against inflation or alternative store-of-value assets. Who is Leading the Charge in Crypto Hoarding? The report points to a substantial number of companies embracing a crypto hoarding strategy. Currently, around 228 public companies have publicly disclosed holding crypto assets. These aren’t just crypto-native firms anymore. Examples include diverse companies like: Metaplanet: A Japanese investment firm aggressively adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset. GameStop: The well-known video game retailer, exploring various Web3 initiatives including NFTs and potentially holding crypto. Trump Media & Technology Group: The media company behind Truth Social, which has also shown interest in digital asset integration. These firms aren’t merely dipping their toes in; they are fundamentally changing their corporate structures and financial policies to facilitate the acquisition and holding of digital assets. This widespread adoption across different sectors signals a maturing view of cryptocurrencies beyond just a speculative play. Does Corporate Crypto Hoarding Reduce Market Risk? One crucial aspect highlighted by the Presto research is the *way* these companies are holding crypto. Unlike some leveraged players in previous cycles, these corporate entities are rarely using their acquired crypto assets as collateral for loans. This is a critical difference. In past market crashes, forced liquidations triggered by over-leveraged positions collateralized by volatile crypto assets created a domino effect, exacerbating the downturn. Because a significant portion of this new wave of corporate crypto strategic reserves is held without being pledged as collateral, the risk of a systemic liquidation cascade originating from these corporate balance sheets is considerably lower than what was observed during the market crash in 2021 or the crypto lender crisis of 2022. This doesn’t eliminate all risk, of course. The report acknowledges that firms could still be compelled to offload their crypto holdings in the event of an urgent need for cash during a liquidity crisis. However, this would likely be a response to external financial pressures on the company itself, rather than a direct consequence of leveraged crypto positions going underwater, which historically has posed a more systemic crypto market risk . What Does This Mean for the Future of the Crypto Market? The increasing trend of corporate crypto adoption and strategic crypto hoarding by public companies suggests a fundamental shift in how mainstream finance views digital assets. It indicates a growing conviction in the long-term value proposition of cryptocurrencies, moving beyond speculative trading into genuine balance sheet management. While the crypto market remains volatile and subject to various external factors, the presence of a growing base of corporate holders who are not heavily leveraged provides a potential stabilizing force. It suggests that even in a downturn, there might be fewer forced sellers driven purely by margin calls related to their crypto holdings. This doesn’t guarantee the absence of bear markets, but it does imply that the nature of potential future downturns might differ from past cycles, potentially being less driven by the specific type of leverage that caused widespread liquidations in 2021 and 2022. The strategic accumulation by companies building crypto strategic reserves is a quiet but powerful endorsement of the asset class. Conclusion: A Sign of Maturation? The significant increase in public companies crypto holdings, as highlighted by Presto research, offers a compelling counterpoint to pervasive fears of an imminent and devastating market bubble burst. The strategic, unleveraged nature of much of this crypto hoarding by firms like Metaplanet, GameStop, and Trump Media represents a structural change in the market. While risks remain, particularly the potential need for companies to sell for liquidity, the reduced threat of systemic liquidation cascades originating from corporate balance sheets is a positive development. This trend underscores a growing institutional confidence and integration of digital assets, suggesting a market that is perhaps maturing beyond the excesses of previous speculative booms and busts.

2025-06-19T21:30:00,"ALEX DeFi Vulnerability: Brief 23-Minute Glitch Had Limited Impact","BitcoinWorld ALEX DeFi Vulnerability: Brief 23-Minute Glitch Had Limited Impact In the fast-paced world of decentralized finance (DeFi), security is paramount. Recently, the team behind ALEX DeFi , an open-source protocol operating on the Stacks blockchain , reported a brief but notable issue within their system. This incident, while quickly addressed, highlights the ongoing challenges in maintaining robust security in the DeFi space. What Happened with the ALEX Protocol? The vulnerability occurred during a recent upgrade to ALEX’s bug bounty contract. According to the foundation, the issue was present for approximately 23 minutes. During this short window, a flaw existed that could potentially allow a single account to submit duplicate compensation claims. The bug was confirmed after a user reported it to Bitcoin World. It specifically affected a page designed to handle reimbursements for individuals impacted by a previous exploit. This meant the vulnerability was tied to a specific process for compensating past victims, not the core trading or lending functions of the ALEX protocol itself. Understanding the DeFi Vulnerability A DeFi vulnerability like this, even a brief one, can raise concerns. However, the ALEX foundation emphasized that the impact was significantly limited. Why? Specific Condition: Exploiting the bug required a user to perform two very specific actions in sequence: first claim compensation through the old contract, and then attempt another claim via the new, recently upgraded contract. Limited Exploitation: Only one individual was identified attempting to exploit this vulnerability by using two different wallet addresses to make duplicate claims. No Impact on Main Operations: Crucially, the distribution of USDC intended for victims of the previous hacks was not affected by this bug. The compensation process for legitimate claims continued as planned. The Role of Crypto Bug Bounty Programs This incident underscores the importance of crypto bug bounty programs. While the vulnerability was brief, it was detected and reported, allowing the ALEX team to address it swiftly. Bug bounty programs incentivize ethical hackers and users to find and report potential flaws before they can be widely exploited, contributing to the overall security of the ecosystem. The foundation is now in contact with the individual who made the duplicate claims, requesting the return of the erroneously received funds. This demonstrates the protocol’s commitment to rectifying issues and maintaining fairness within its community. Navigating Security on the Stacks Blockchain Building secure protocols on any blockchain, including the Stacks blockchain , requires continuous vigilance. Stacks, which brings smart contracts and decentralized applications to Bitcoin, benefits from Bitcoin’s underlying security but still requires careful smart contract design and auditing for the applications built on top of it, like ALEX. While ALEX has faced significant security challenges in the past, including major exploits in May 2023 and June 2024, the swift identification and limited impact of this recent 23-minute vulnerability show that monitoring and rapid response mechanisms are in place, even during system upgrades. Conclusion: A Brief Scare, Quickly Managed The 23-minute vulnerability in the ALEX compensation system was a brief scare that highlights the inherent risks and the continuous need for vigilance in the DeFi space. The limited window, specific conditions for exploitation, and the fact that it only affected duplicate claims significantly mitigated the potential damage. The incident serves as a reminder that even minor glitches can occur during system upgrades, but effective monitoring and community reporting, facilitated by programs like a crypto bug bounty , are vital for maintaining trust and security in decentralized protocols like ALEX DeFi on the Stacks blockchain .

2025-06-19T21:20:04,"Ohio Crypto Tax: Major Step Forward as House Passes Bill Exempting Small Transactions","BitcoinWorld Ohio Crypto Tax: Major Step Forward as House Passes Bill Exempting Small Transactions Big news from the Buckeye State! If you’re in Ohio and dabble in cryptocurrencies, a significant change might be coming to how your crypto transactions are taxed. The Ohio House of Representatives has taken a notable step by passing a bill that could ease the tax burden on smaller digital asset exchanges. Understanding Ohio House Bill 116: What’s on the Table? The core of this development revolves around Ohio House Bill 116 (HB 116). This proposed legislation, introduced by State Representative Steve Demetriou, aims to create a more favorable environment for cryptocurrency users and potentially the mining industry within Ohio. Its passage through the House is a crucial milestone, signaling growing legislative attention to the world of digital assets at the state level. Before reaching the full House floor, HB 116 received unanimous bipartisan support from the House Technology and Innovation Committee. This level of cross-party agreement suggests a shared interest in addressing how crypto interacts with existing state frameworks, particularly concerning taxation and economic activity like mining. Now that the House has given its nod, the bill moves to the Ohio Senate for further consideration. If it successfully navigates the Senate and passes there, the final step would be gaining the signature of Republican Governor Mike DeWine to become law. The Key Provision: A Potential Crypto Tax Exemption for Small Transactions The most talked-about aspect of HB 116 is its provision for a crypto tax exemption on smaller transactions. Specifically, the bill proposes exempting crypto transactions below $200 from state capital gains tax. This is a significant detail for anyone using cryptocurrency for everyday purchases or minor exchanges. Here’s a breakdown of why this exemption matters: Easing the Burden: Currently, under existing tax laws (both federal and state), selling or exchanging cryptocurrency is often considered a taxable event. If you sell crypto for a profit, you owe capital gains tax. This applies even if you’re just using crypto to buy a cup of coffee or a small item. Promoting Micro-Transactions: The $200 threshold is designed to make using crypto for small, routine purchases much simpler from a tax perspective. Imagine buying something online for $50 with Bitcoin; under current rules, you’d technically need to track the cost basis and potential gain or loss for that small transaction. HB 116 aims to eliminate that complexity for amounts under the limit. Reducing Complexity: Tracking capital gains and losses on numerous small crypto transactions can be a significant headache for individuals. This exemption would dramatically reduce the record-keeping burden for users who aren’t engaging in large-scale trading but rather using crypto for utility. How Does This Impact Your Crypto Capital Gains Tax in Ohio? To understand the impact of HB 116, it’s helpful to quickly review what crypto capital gains tax entails. When you acquire cryptocurrency, that’s your cost basis. If you later sell, trade, or use that crypto to buy something for more than your cost basis, you realize a capital gain. This gain is subject to taxation. For example, if you bought $100 worth of Ethereum and later used a portion of it (worth $150 at the time) to buy goods, you would have a $50 capital gain that needs to be reported and taxed. Under HB 116, if that transaction value was below $200 (like the $150 example), the capital gain associated with it would potentially be exempt from Ohio’s state capital gains tax. This doesn’t eliminate the federal tax obligation (as state laws don’t override federal ones), but it removes a layer of state-level complexity and cost for small disposals. What About Crypto Transactions Beyond the Tax Exemption? It’s crucial to remember that the proposed exemption only applies to crypto transactions valued below $200. Any transaction exceeding this threshold would still be subject to Ohio’s standard capital gains tax rules, assuming the bill passes in its current form. This means that trading larger amounts of crypto, selling significant holdings, or using crypto for high-value purchases would still require careful tracking of cost basis and reporting of gains or losses. The bill also reportedly includes provisions related to crypto mining operations. While the specific details of these provisions weren’t extensively covered in the initial report, such inclusions often address regulatory clarity, energy consumption considerations, or potential tax incentives or frameworks for mining businesses operating within the state. This suggests a broader effort by Ohio lawmakers to consider various facets of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, not just individual user transactions. What’s Next for the Ohio Crypto Tax Bill? The journey for the Ohio crypto tax bill, HB 116, is not yet complete. Its passage through the House is a significant hurdle cleared, demonstrating legislative will, but it now faces review and potential amendments in the Ohio Senate. The Senate may hold committee hearings, propose changes, and then vote on the bill. If it passes the Senate, it must then be signed into law by Governor DeWine. Here’s the path ahead: Ohio Senate Review: The bill will be assigned to a Senate committee, likely one focused on technology, finance, or taxation. Potential Amendments: Senators may propose changes to the bill’s language, the $200 threshold, or the mining provisions. Senate Vote: If it passes committee, it will go to the full Senate for a vote. Governor’s Desk: If the Senate passes it without amendments, it goes straight to the Governor. If amended, it might need to go back to the House for agreement on the changes. Becoming Law: If the Governor signs it, it becomes law on a specified effective date. This process can take time, and there’s no guarantee the bill will pass the Senate or be signed by the Governor. However, the strong bipartisan support in the House suggests it has a reasonable chance of progressing. Actionable Insights for Ohio Residents If you are an Ohio resident who uses or holds cryptocurrency, here are some actionable steps: Stay Informed: Follow the progress of HB 116 through the Ohio Senate. News outlets covering state legislation and cryptocurrency news will be key sources. Understand Current Rules: Regardless of the bill’s outcome, understand the current state and federal tax rules regarding crypto capital gains. Keep meticulous records of your crypto purchases and sales. Prepare for Potential Change: If the bill passes, familiarize yourself with the specifics of the $200 exemption and how it applies to your transactions. Consider Advocacy (Optional): If you feel strongly about the bill, consider contacting your State Senator to express your views. Conclusion: A Positive Signal for Crypto Adoption in Ohio? The passage of Ohio House Bill 116 through the House is undoubtedly a positive signal for those hoping to see clearer and potentially less burdensome regulations for cryptocurrency users at the state level. The proposed crypto tax exemption for transactions under $200 is a practical step that could make using crypto for small, everyday purposes much more feasible and less taxing (literally and figuratively) for Ohio residents. While the bill still has hurdles to clear in the Senate and with the Governor, its initial success with bipartisan support highlights a growing recognition among lawmakers of cryptocurrency’s role in the modern economy and the need for updated regulations. This move positions Ohio as a state potentially open to fostering crypto adoption by addressing one of the key pain points for users: tax complexity on small crypto transactions.

2025-06-19T21:00:59,"Ethereum Bullish Wave Towards ATH Coming? Here Are The Targets","Recent price action in the past 24 hours has seen Ethereum clawing back above $2,500 after a pullback that saw its price fall to a low of $2,440. This is a notable correction from Ethereum’s foray to $2,770 in the past seven-day timeframe, but according to crypto analyst KledjdiCuni, it aligns with one of the anticipated price scenarios. Now, the analyst’s outlook is of a reversal into a bullish wave. In his latest update, KlejdiCuni laid out several upside targets that traders may want to keep in focus if Ethereum confirms a breakout. Accumulation And Bullish Setup Toward $2,800 Breakout Crypto analyst KlejdiCuni, posting on the TradingView platform, believes Ethereum may now be on the verge of initiating a much larger bullish trend. According to his analysis, the $2,440 region held up as expected, confirming it as a strong accumulation zone. Related Reading: Analyst Says Ethereum Is Ready To Surge With Higher Lows Against Bitcoin, But There’s A Caveat In the daily candlestick price chart he shared, KlejdiCuni illustrated what he identifies as a bullish pattern. This pattern is a formation of higher lows and relatively stable resistance near the upper boundary. This setup resembles an ascending channel structure, which suggests that buyers are gradually taking control of Ethereum’s price action. Ethereum’s rebound to $2,660 has formed a structure that could break above the current pattern, likely in the direction of $2,800. This aligns with the upper resistance boundary of the bullish pattern, and as such, it is the first immediate target to look towards for a breakout to higher price levels. Price Targets For Ethereum If Ethereum successfully breaks above the $2,800 resistance level, the bullish momentum could signal the start of the expected bullish trend, according to the analyst. In this case, the first major target in this sequence is $3,300. Ethereum’s reaction here would be one to watch, as it coincides with a resistance level in late January 2025 that eventually broke to the downside in early February 2025. If Ethereum manages to clear this zone, it would confirm a sustained buying interest. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Could Rally To $10,000 If This Major Resistance Is Broke Should Ethereum maintain its upward pressure beyond $3,300, the next target is at $3,800. This level carries particular technical significance, as it coincides with an order block in early January that caused the initial rejection as it tried to push toward the $4,000 price level again. Breaking through $3,800 to the upside would be an indication that bullish sentiment has taken firm hold across higher timeframes again. Finally, if the bullish wave extends uninterrupted, the analyst projects a longer-term target of $4,500. This level is only a short distance from Ethereum’s all-time high of around $4,878, and reaching it would represent a near-complete recovery from the prolonged bear market. Hitting $4,500 would also place Ethereum at new price highs for this cycle. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,521, having retraced by 0.7% in the past 24 hours.

2025-06-19T21:00:13,"Bitcoin Faces Tight Daily Squeeze – Volatility Incoming Amid Geopolitical Risks","Bitcoin is under pressure, but bears continue to fail in their attempts to break key demand levels. Despite a volatile macro backdrop driven by the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict, BTC remains firmly supported above $103,600, a crucial price floor. This resilience highlights that buyers are still defending their ground, even as fear and uncertainty dominate the broader market.

The price remains stuck in a narrow range, yet continues to trade near all-time highs—a sign of strength amid chaos. Investors are waiting for clarity, with most expecting a volatile breakout once the direction becomes clearer. Data from CryptoQuant adds weight to this view, showing that Bitcoin is currently in a pronounced squeeze on the daily timeframe. This type of price compression typically precedes large directional moves and a surge in volatility. As the range tightens and market participants grow more cautious, a breakout —either to the upside or downside—becomes increasingly likely. Bitcoin Consolidates As Volatility Builds Bitcoin remains in a consolidation phase, puzzling investors with its muted price action amid mounting global tensions. Despite the geopolitical chaos and fears of broader conflict, Bitcoin’s fundamentals remain strong. Institutional adoption continues to grow, on-chain metrics show supply is steadily declining on centralized exchanges, and long-term holders remain resilient. This backdrop typically supports bullish momentum, yet BTC remains range-bound. The situation in the Middle East has added a fresh layer of uncertainty. As hostilities between Israel and Iran escalate, the threat of US intervention looms larger. Markets are pricing in the possibility of a broader conflict that could destabilize global equities, oil, and currencies. Bitcoin has historically responded well to uncertainty, thriving during macroeconomic dislocations. However, it is still largely viewed as a risk asset. In a risk-off environment—where investors flee to cash, bonds, and safe-haven assets like gold—Bitcoin could experience sharper declines compared to traditional markets. Top analyst Axel Adler highlights a technical setup that could be the prelude to Bitcoin’s next major move. On the daily timeframe, BTC is entering a pronounced squeeze, a pattern often followed by surging volatility. With narrowing price action and reduced momentum, Bitcoin is building pressure. If geopolitical tensions resolve or shift direction, the squeeze could result in a breakout. But if global instability worsens, especially with US military involvement, the market could pivot into a sell-off. For now, the market appears to be waiting. Bitcoin’s direction over the coming sessions will likely depend on how the macro situation evolves and whether investor sentiment shifts toward fear or renewed optimism. Traders should watch closely—this squeeze may not last much longer. Price Holds Steady Above Support In Tight Range The daily Bitcoin chart shows BTC trading just below $105,000, in a tight consolidation range between the $103,600 support zone and the $109,300 resistance level. Price action continues to coil within this channel, suggesting the market is in a state of equilibrium, waiting for a clear catalyst to drive the next major move. Despite recent selling pressure, bears have failed to break below the $103,600 level—a key structure that served as the previous all-time high in December 2024. The 50-day simple moving average (SMA) sits just beneath the current price at $104,525 and is acting as short-term dynamic support. Below that, the 100-day and 200-day SMAs remain well-structured in bullish alignment, reinforcing the longer-term uptrend. Volume, however, remains subdued, indicating that traders are hesitant to commit heavily until macro clarity emerges. This compression in price could build into a breakout attempt, particularly if Bitcoin holds above $104K and manages to reclaim $106K–$107K levels in the coming sessions. A strong move above $109,300 could trigger another leg higher, while a close below $103,600 may open the door to further downside. Until then, Bitcoin remains in a holding pattern amid a broader backdrop of global uncertainty.

2025-06-19T21:00:06,"Bitcoin Recovers Key Levels, But the Fed Offers No Relief: A Forecast for the Start of Q3 For Major Altcoins","Bitcoin has bounced back , reclaiming crucial benchmarks. Yet, the Federal Reserve's stance remains firm, providing no easing of policy. As Q3 begins, the spotlight turns to major altcoins. Which ones are poised for a surge? This article dives into the latest market trends, analyzing which digital currencies are primed for potential growth in the coming months. Ethereum Price Shifts: Past Trends and Current Key Levels Over the past month, Ethereum saw a minor decline of about 0.15% along with a weekly drop near 9%, indicating short-term pressure. Over the last six months, the coin tumbled roughly 27% from its earlier highs, reflecting significant downward momentum. Historical figures show fluctuating price action characterized by periods of calm interrupted by notable declines. Although there was a brief stabilization in mid-range values, the sustained slump over half a year is a strong reminder of market volatility. Currently, Ethereum’s price is within its established range, oscillating between just above $1920 and nearly $2960. Key levels include immediate support at $1318.72 and resistance at $3395.40, with a lower support around $280.38 and a further resistance at $4433.74. Market indicators like the Awesome Oscillator and Momentum Indicator show negative values, suggesting a bearish outlook. The Relative Strength Index at 49 indicates balance between selling and buying, but the six-month decline points to underlying pressure. Traders may consider waiting for a clear trend before committing capital, while short-term plays could be made between support and resistance levels. A range-bound trading strategy may be advantageous in this uncertain market. SOL Market Update - Testing Key Support and Resistance Levels Solana experienced a notable decline in recent months with a one-month drop of about 12% and a six-month fall of nearly 25%. The coin traded within a range of $136 to $182 while weekly losses hit around 9%. Indicators showed negative pressure with the Awesome Oscillator at -11.258 and the Momentum Indicator at -14.83. The Relative Strength Index lingered at 41.33, reflecting a trend consistently below neutral. Price action over the past weeks points to a bearish phase, with downward momentum dominating the session. The patterns suggest that the sell-off has kept the market in a corrective mode. Current price activity centers around key technical levels. The nearest support stands at $115.84 with a secondary support level near $69.81, while resistance levels are marked at $207.90 and a higher barrier at $253.93. The market shows a cautious bear sentiment as prices struggle to break beyond the lower resistance zone. Traders may consider buy opportunities near support levels for a short-term rebound or short positions near resistance if the price fails to maintain upward momentum. Monitoring price action around these levels is crucial for deciding entries and exits, while also paying attention to momentum changes and volume shifts. Cardano Market Overview: Recent Declines and Key Trading Levels Cardano experienced a 1-month drop of nearly 19% and a 6-month decrease of about 36.5%. A 1-week decline of 13.63% highlighted short-term weakness, with price action settling within a corridor between $0.5967 and $0.8187. This range reflects reduced buying interest. The Awesome Oscillator stood at -0.0769 and the Momentum Indicator at -0.103, while the RSI of 33.378 indicates oversold conditions. Recommendations from the summary, moving average, and oscillators remain negative. Overall, significant declines and a lack of robust upward momentum suggest that the market is in retreat, struggling to breach previous resistance levels. Current market levels place Cardano between $0.5967 and $0.8187. Immediate resistance is observed at $0.9523, with support at $0.5083. A higher resistance exists at $1.1743, while deeper support is near $0.2863. Technical indicators show a bearish outlook, and the price behavior does not indicate a strong upward trend, with bears dominating the trading environment. Any bounce from $0.5083 may present a short-term buying opportunity if sellers don't push prices lower. Conversely, a move beyond $0.9523 could lead short-term traders to exit for profit-taking. Further declines below support could extend toward $0.2863. Traders should act cautiously, focusing on entry and exit points within the established range. Conclusion Bitcoin regaining key levels is a positive sign, yet the Fed's stance keeps the market in suspense. ETH is likely to see gradual growth, driven by strong developer activity. SOL might experience moderate gains, given its active ecosystem. ADA appears set for a steady path, boosted by its latest upgrades. The broader market may remain cautious but holds potential for targeted advancements in key altcoins. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

NoOnes CEO Ray Youssef explains why. Rising tensions in the Middle East are exposing a flaw in how some traders view Bitcoin (BTC) . Instead of acting as a hedge, Bitcoin is behaving more like a tech stock, says Ray Youssef, CEO of NoOnes, a crypto peer-to-peer payments and trading platform. “Markets usually don’t like surprises — but lately, crypto doesn’t seem to react much. Over the past week, we’ve seen a major hack targeting Iran’s biggest crypto exchange, growing tensions in the Middle East, and even signs of digital warfare. Yet crypto prices have barely moved,” Ray Yossef, NoOnes. Yossef also highlighted the $100 million breach of Nobitex, Iran’s biggest crypto exchange. The hack, likely performed by Predatory Sparrow, a hacking group with ties to Israel , would have sounded alarm bells earlier. You might also like: Iran imposes curfew on crypto exchanges following Nobitex hack Escalating tensions are usually positive for hedge assets. However, Bitcoin’s reaction was muted, continuing to trade around $105,000. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) also traded between $2,120 and $2,330, now for the seventh week in a row. This is despite significant whale inflows , amounting to 871,000 ETH over one week. Bitcoin fails as a hedge asset for now: Yossef Bitcoin’s lack of movement, according to Youssef, suggests that its hedge-asset narrative is losing traction in today’s market. Bitcoin no longer appears to function as a hedge asset; instead, it behaves more like a high-beta tech stock, caught in the macro winds but not really steering its own ship. The link between BTC and the Nasdaq 100 is still strong at 0.68,” Ray Yossef, NoOnes. Still, Youssef notes that geopolitical risk is driving a shift within the broader crypto landscape. Bitcoin dominance is approaching 66%, as traders retreat from riskier altcoins. If global tensions continue to mount, this rotation into BTC could accelerate, especially if capital controls, sanctions, and infrastructure disruptions enter the mix.

2025-06-19T20:20:37,"Urgent Crypto Alert: ETH/BTC Ratio Stalls, Delaying Altcoin Season","BitcoinWorld Urgent Crypto Alert: ETH/BTC Ratio Stalls, Delaying Altcoin Season Are you waiting for the next big move in the crypto market? Many investors are eagerly anticipating the start of ‘altcoin season’ – that exciting period when smaller cryptocurrencies surge in value, often outpacing Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, a key indicator, the ETH/BTC ratio , is currently sending a cautious signal that suggests this anticipated rally might be delayed. What the Stagnant ETH/BTC Ratio Tells Us The ETH/BTC ratio is a crucial metric in the cryptocurrency world. It measures the value of one Ethereum (ETH) relative to one Bitcoin (BTC). Think of it as a barometer for investor sentiment towards Ethereum compared to the market leader, Bitcoin. When the ratio rises, it typically means ETH is performing better than BTC, indicating stronger interest in Ethereum and often, a willingness to take on more risk by investing in altcoins. Conversely, a falling or stagnant ratio suggests ETH is underperforming or simply keeping pace with BTC, which can point to weaker confidence in altcoins. According to analysis highlighted by BeInCrypto, the ETH/BTC ratio has been trading within a remarkably narrow range since mid-May. This lack of significant movement reflects a hesitant attitude from investors towards Ethereum. Why is this important? Because Ethereum is the largest altcoin by market cap, its performance relative to Bitcoin is often seen as a precursor or catalyst for broader altcoin rallies. If ETH isn’t showing strength against BTC, it’s less likely that smaller altcoins will find the momentum needed for a widespread ‘altcoin season’. Analyst Insight: The Critical 0.024 Level Prominent analyst Crypto Fella recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to emphasize the significance of the current ETH/BTC ratio chart. The pair is currently hovering precariously close to the 0.024 level. This isn’t just a random number; it holds historical importance. This level marked previous cycle bottoms for the ETH/BTC ratio in 2019 and 2020. Following those instances, Ethereum saw strong rebounds against Bitcoin, which helped pave the way for significant altcoin market rallies. Here’s a simplified look at the significance: 0.024 Level: Historically a strong support zone for the ETH/BTC ratio. Previous Cycles (2019, 2020): Bouncing off this level preceded strong ETH performance and subsequent altcoin runs. Current Situation: The ratio is testing this level, but without a clear rebound signal yet. The analyst’s caution lies in the fact that while the ratio is near a historically significant support, there hasn’t been a decisive show of strength or a clear bullish reversal signal yet. Simply touching the level isn’t enough; a strong bounce is needed to indicate renewed investor confidence in Ethereum relative to Bitcoin. Why a Stagnant Ratio Delays Altcoin Season The connection between the ETH/BTC ratio and ‘altcoin season’ is fundamental to understanding the current crypto market outlook . Bitcoin typically leads market cycles. As confidence grows, investors first move into Bitcoin. Once Bitcoin has made significant gains and perhaps consolidates, capital often flows into Ethereum, the second-largest and most established cryptocurrency with a vast ecosystem (DeFi, NFTs, etc.). If Ethereum starts performing strongly against Bitcoin (the ratio rises), it signals increasing risk appetite in the market. This is the point where investors often start looking further down the market cap list, seeking higher potential returns in smaller altcoins. Therefore, if the ETH/BTC ratio remains stuck or weakens, that capital rotation from BTC to ETH, and subsequently into smaller altcoins, is stalled. The current stagnation suggests that capital is either staying primarily in Bitcoin or is on the sidelines, rather than aggressively flowing into Ethereum and other altcoins. This subdued activity in ETH relative to BTC directly impacts the potential for a broad-based altcoin rally. What to Watch For: Actionable Insights for the Crypto Market For those invested in or considering investing in altcoins, monitoring the ETH/BTC ratio is crucial. Here are some actionable insights based on the current situation and the analyst’s observations: Watch the 0.024 Level: Observe how the ETH/BTC ratio behaves around this historical support. A strong bounce and sustained move above this level would be a positive sign. Look for a Clear Show of Strength: This means not just a small uptick, but a noticeable, multi-day or weekly rally in the ETH/BTC chart. Increased volume accompanying the move would add conviction. Monitor Ethereum Price Action: Independently of the ratio, observe the Ethereum price against USD. Strong bullish momentum here, especially if it starts outpacing Bitcoin price gains, would reinforce the potential for a ratio increase. Monitor Bitcoin Price Action: While the ratio is key, the overall crypto market outlook is heavily influenced by Bitcoin. If Bitcoin experiences a significant downturn, it’s likely to drag the entire market, including ETH and altcoins, down, regardless of the ratio’s position. Stability or continued upward movement in BTC is generally supportive. Assess Overall Market Sentiment: Are headlines bullish or bearish? Is there increased retail interest? These broader factors also play a role. Until the ETH/BTC ratio shows a convincing rebound from current levels, the analyst’s view suggests that the anticipated ‘altcoin season’ remains on hold. This period of stagnation could continue until a clear catalyst emerges to drive significant capital back into Ethereum relative to Bitcoin. Challenges and Potential Outcomes The primary challenge is the lack of clear direction. Will the 0.024 level hold as support, leading to a bounce and potentially reigniting ‘altcoin season’? Or will it break, signaling further weakness for ETH relative to BTC and potentially a longer delay or even a significant downturn for altcoins? Scenario 1 (Bullish for Altcoins): The ETH/BTC ratio finds strong support at or near 0.024, bounces convincingly, and starts trending upwards. This would likely precede or coincide with a renewed rally in Ethereum price and a subsequent flow of capital into smaller altcoins, triggering the long-awaited ‘altcoin season’. Scenario 2 (Bearish for Altcoins): The ETH/BTC ratio breaks below the 0.024 level and continues to fall. This would indicate significant underperformance of ETH against BTC, likely due to weaker confidence or capital rotation primarily into Bitcoin or out of the market altogether. This scenario would be detrimental to altcoins, potentially leading to significant price drops. Scenario 3 (Continued Stagnation): The ratio continues to trade in a tight range around 0.024. This implies ongoing indecision and weak conviction, keeping ‘altcoin season’ on pause. While not immediately bearish, prolonged stagnation can lead to investor fatigue. Understanding these potential outcomes helps investors manage expectations and risks within the current crypto market outlook . Conclusion: Patience is Key in the Current Crypto Market Outlook The message from the ETH/BTC ratio is clear: the market is currently favoring Bitcoin or sitting on the sidelines, and a widespread ‘altcoin season’ is unlikely to kick off until Ethereum demonstrates clear strength relative to the market leader. The 0.024 level is a critical watchpoint, but a simple touch isn’t enough – a convincing rebound is needed. While the delay might be frustrating for altcoin holders, it also provides an opportunity for observation and strategic planning. Monitoring the key indicators discussed, particularly the ETH/BTC ratio and the price action of both Ethereum price and Bitcoin price , is essential for navigating the current crypto market outlook and positioning yourself for when the market dynamics eventually shift.

2025-06-19T20:19:08,"Analysis Company Releases Critical Weekly Report on Bitcoin – Is BTC Healthy in the Current Situation?","Cryptocurrency analysis company Glassnode has evaluated the current state of Bitcoin and the general cryptocurrency market in its latest report. The report noted that while the number of transactions on the network has decreased, the total amount of value moved has increased. This situation reveals that especially large investors and companies are becoming increasingly dominant in on-chain activities. Glassnode reminded that the number of daily transactions on the Bitcoin network showed an upward trend in 2023 and 2024 and reached a peak of 734 thousand transactions. However, this number has decreased significantly since the beginning of 2025. The number of daily transactions currently ranges between 320 thousand and 500 thousand. Despite this, the economic value carried on the Bitcoin network continues to remain at very high levels. While the annual average daily transfer of $ 7.5 billion was made, this value reached $ 16 billion when the record of $ 100 thousand was broken in November 2024. The average volume of each transaction is currently around $36,200. This shows that although the number of transactions is decreasing, each transaction still contains a significant amount of value. This trend shows that the Bitcoin network is used more for high-value transfers and that individual users are relatively decreasing. Related News: Big Bull Anthony Scaramucci Drops a Bold Prediction: “I Think It Will Surpass Ethereum” The report stated that the share of transactions over $100,000 in the total transaction volume on the network was 66% in November 2022, and this rate has reached 89% today. This statistic clearly shows that the weight of institutional investors or high-net-worth individuals in on-chain activities has increased over time. Despite Bitcoin being just 6% away from its all-time high of $111,700, transaction fees remain low and demand for block space remains weak. While periods of high prices in previous cycles were often accompanied by increased network congestion and transaction fees, this cycle is seeing a clear divergence. Glassnode says the main reason for this is the shift of activity to off-chain platforms. Centralized exchanges (CEX) in particular currently account for the majority of cryptocurrency trading volume, with spot, futures, and options trading collectively exceeding on-chain trading by 7 to 16 times. This suggests that the majority of investors are now opting for centralized platforms over on-chain. Another noteworthy point in the report is that the total value of open positions in the futures and options markets has reached $96.2 billion. This shows that the amount of leveraged transactions in the market has increased. However, as a pleasing development, it is stated that the collateral used in open positions has become healthier. It is emphasized that positions collateralized by stablecoins in particular now constitute the majority. *This is not investment advice.

Elon Musk’s X Advances Its Super App Vision Ultimately, the new feature will let users trade and invest directly in the X app. This change makes the app a single place for both content and financial services. It is worth noting that the launch will start in the United States with a new brand called X Money. Meanwhile, this new initiative expands X’s digital payments and financial technology efforts. Musk wants to change how people use financial tools by directly adding stock trading, crypto investing, and digital payments into the platform. The new X Money wallet will support regular cash transactions, peer-to-peer payments, and possibly digital assets, making it more versatile than current apps. Elon Musk X Removes Bitcoin and Crypto Hashtag Last year, Elon Musk’s X removed the Bitcoin hashtag emoji , sparking diverse reactions from the cryptocurrency community. This decision is part of a broader update by the platform, which has eliminated all hashtag emojis, not just the one associated with Bitcoin. The removal, however, was not publicly announced, leaving users speculating about the reasons behind this apparent change. Some users are disappointed, as they felt the emojis brought a unique and enjoyable aspect to their social media interactions. On the other hand, some users think that X might be removing the feature to clean up the platform and reduce clutter. Others speculate that this decision could be influenced by changing regulations and X’s need to remain neutral about cryptocurrencies. Elon Musk Building an Everything App Meanwhile, the enigmatic boss revealed his intention to stop using his phone number and instead use the X app for texts and audio/video calls. Under Musk’s leadership, this recent addition is part of a series of improvements to the platform’s core experience. Following his acquisition of the social media company, Musk indicated his plans to turn the platform into a super-app . He also plans to provide several services, including messaging, social networking, and peer-to-peer payments. Furthermore, Musk plans to take out traditional banks.

2025-06-19T20:03:09,"Despite All the Recent Developments, Bitcoin Remains Above $100,000 – What Does This Mean, and What’s Next for BTC?","Bitcoin has managed to stay above the $100,000 level for more than five weeks amid rising geopolitical tensions and persistent macroeconomic uncertainty, with analysts arguing that the level has become a permanent floor price rather than a “psychological support” in investors’ minds. Elliot Johnson, CEO of the newly established Bitcoin Treasury Corporation, noted that Bitcoin has remained resilient, especially despite the Israel-Iran tensions and the relatively hawkish stance of the Fed announced this week. Johnson said, “Bitcoin has remained incredibly resilient in recent weeks,” emphasizing that the $100,000 level is now “firmly established.” The FED kept interest rates steady yesterday, but the updated dot plot predicts only one rate cut in 2025. This is less dovish than the market expected. Analysts say this stance could extend the sideways trend in stock and bond markets. Related News: Big Bull Anthony Scaramucci Drops a Bold Prediction: “I Think It Will Surpass Ethereum” Johnson also noted that Bitcoin has strengthened its position not only as a safe haven, but also as an alternative asset to the depreciating US dollar and a long-term treasury reserve. His founder, Bitcoin Treasury Corporation, aims to help institutional companies adopt Bitcoin as a long-term reserve asset. One of the strongest examples of institutional demand was MicroStrategy, which bought $1.05 billion worth of new BTC last week. The company’s founder, Michael Saylor, is the largest investor in Bitcoin. Nic Puckrin, founder of Coin Bureau, also said that markets have generally entered a “wait-and-see” mode. Drawing attention to the stagnant course in oil, gold, the S&P 500 and the dollar index, Puckrin said, “But Bitcoin is disrupting this course. $100,000 is no longer just a support level, it is settling in investors’ minds as a base price.” According to Puckrin, there are also macroeconomic headwinds behind this resilient stance. While two interest rate cuts are still expected for 2025, signals from the Bank of Japan that it will ease monetary tightening in 2026 also suggest that liquidity could increase again. In this scenario, Bitcoin is expected to be the biggest gainer, according to the analyst. *This is not investment advice.

Explains Glassnode, “Spot market signals weakened across the board, momentum fell back toward neutral, spot CVD turned sharply negative, and volume dipped below the statistical low band… …the sharp reversal in perpetual CVD suggests short-term traders may be trimming risk.” While there was a sharp rise in inflows to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Glassnode says there was subdued organic on-chain activity as evidenced by falling fees, no growth in active addresses and only a moderate transfer volume. “ETF flows rose sharply, reaffirming institutional demand, though trade volume declined, showing more passive accumulation than active trading.” According to Glassnode, close to 97% of the Bitcoin supply is currently sitting at a profit, and this presents a risk of a sell-off if the demand for the crypto king remains subdued. “Without renewed demand from both retail and institutional investors, the current cooling momentum may persist.” Bitcoin is trading at $104,457 at time of writing, down by around 7% from the all-time high price of $111,800.

2025-06-19T20:00:02,"Big Move For XRP: Ripple-Backed ETF Launches In Canada","Canada’s Toronto Stock Exchange today saw a new entrant aimed at making XRP more accessible to investors. The 3iQ Corp. rolled out its spot-based XRP ETF, trading under the ticker XRPQ, with an introductory 0% management fee for the first six months. Related Reading: Tether Enforces Freeze On $12 Million In Tron Funds Over Illicit Activity Based on reports, this move offers both retail and institutional clients a hands‑off way to own XRP without worrying about private wallets or unregulated platforms. Building Trust Through Custody According to the announcement, XRPQ will hold its XRP coins in cold storage, kept separate for each investor to cut down the chance of a hack. The fund plans to buy XRP from regulated sources like over‑the‑counter desks. That setup mirrors what other digital‑asset funds do for Bitcoin and Ether. We are excited to announce the launch of the 3iQ XRP ETF (TSX: XRPQ, XRPQ.U) — one of the first ETFs in North America to provide exposure to #XRP. XRPQ debuts with a 0% management fee for the first six months, and @Ripple as an early investor in the fund. “The launch of XRPQ… pic.twitter.com/me19RLAzJI — 3iQ Digital Asset Management (@3iq_corp) June 18, 2025 Backing From Ripple San Francisco’s Ripple has taken a stake in the new fund, according to reports. The company didn’t share how much it invested, but its support sends a strong message. It shows Ripple believes in XRPQ’s structure and security, even after years of uncertainty about XRP in the US courts. Growth Of XRP Over A Decade Data from 2015 to now shows that XRP’s price jumped to around 10,700%, climbing from $0.02 back then to $2.16 today. That surge underscores why 3iQ’s CEO and President, Pascal St‑Jean, called this ETF “an easy way for Canadians and qualified investors overseas to tap into XRP’s growth.” He rang the TSX’s closing bell to mark the launch. Purpose Joins The Fray Reports also disclose that Purpose Investments launched its own XRP ETF, XRPP, on the same day. That makes two spot XRP ETFs now available on the same exchange. Both products aim to give investors a regulated path to XRP, but only time will tell which approach wins more fans.

Traders and managers predict a green light could come by October 2025. Until then, US investors will be watching from the sidelines, while Canada continues to lead in crypto‑ETF innovation. With XRPQ’s debut, 3iQ highlights its mission of opening up digital assets in a regulated way. It’s a clear sign that more traditional markets are warming up to crypto. And with Ripple’s backing and a zero‑fee for half a year, this new ETF could draw attention from anyone who wants XRP exposure without the usual hurdles.

The SEI price jumped over 13% to hit an intraday high of $0.19, its highest level since June 12. Why is SEI price up? Sei Network’s native token appears to have surged following a key announcement from the blockchain project’s team. Sei posted via X that the Wyoming Stable Token Commission had selected Sei as one of two candidate blockchains for the state’s fiat-backed stablecoin , WYST.

That said, market participants do not appear to be buying the news on the announcement, with the meme coin falling 3% since. TRUMP remains 40% below its late-May peak following the presidential dinner for top holders, struggling to regain traction. Still, the testament from Binance Loans could refocus attention on fundamentals, introducing potential utility that could increase demand beyond short-term speculative trading. Binance Adds TRUMP as Loanable Asset on Binance Loans (Flexible Rate) and VIP Loan https://t.co/MQRUA83Pso — Binance (@binance) January 24, 2025 Trump Coin Price Analysis: Could New Utility Push a Major Breakout? The Trump Coin price may be gearing up for a revival, as early bullish signals emerge on lower time frames during a retest of a falling wedge pattern forming since late April. TRUMP / USDT 4-hour chart, falling wedge retest. Source: TradingView, Binance. The RSI has made a sharp rebound to 32 after reaching deep oversold territory at 25—often a signal that buyers stepping in as sellers reach their point of exhaustion. More so, the MACD line is nearing a golden cross above the signal line, a classic bullish reversal pattern that typically precedes a short-term uptrend on the 4-hour timeframe. The TRUMP coin price is currently testing key support around $9.30—where the wedge’s lower boundary meets a historical price floor and the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level. A successful reversal from this confluence zone could trigger a move toward the upper trendline of the wedge, putting the 0.382 Fibonacci level at $10.70 in focus as a breakout zone. If bulls gain control and a breakout follows, the falling wedge structure sets up a technical target of $16.50—a potential 77% move back to late-May highs. Still, if $9.30 fails to hold, the next support rests at $7.15, around 22% below current levels, aligning with the mid-April market bottom and invalidating the bullish setup. While Altcoins Struggle, Bitcoin Season Just Got a Whole Lot More Bullish Those who jumped to more speculative plays like TRUMP coin over the leading crypto may be forced to reconsider as the Bitcoin ecosystem finally addresses its biggest limitation: scalability. Slow transactions, high fees, and limited programmability have held it back from competing with the Ethereum and Solana networks—until now. And this shift starts with Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Bitcoin’s first real-time Layer 2 that brings Solana-level speed and smart contracts directly to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and anchored by a decentralized Canonical Bridge, it enables fast, cheap, and composable dApps—all while staying secured by Bitcoin. With over $1.4 million in its second presale week, investors are already rallying behind $HYPER , potentially credited to its huge 533% APY on staking that rewards early investors.

In a new thread, crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe tells his 792,600 followers on the social media platform X that if the crypto king can reclaim the $106,000 level, it would signal its next big leg up. “Update on Bitcoin: It has taken the liquidity and bounced back upwards. What’s next? Ideally, I’d like to see $106,000 break back up and hold. That would be the big signal for the next bull market leg.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Van de Poppe goes on to say that he expects the top crypto asset by market cap to test the $106,000 level “in the coming days” while noting that the Fed’s latest meeting was a whiff. “FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) show is over, which was a nothing burger, means that we’re back into the normal trading game for Bitcoin. I suppose we’ll see a test of $106,000 and breakout north in the coming days. Altcoins are, again, outperforming.” Concluding his analysis with Ethereum ( ETH ), Van de Poppe says it appears the market is ready to rotate into the second-largest digital asset by market cap and other altcoins, as ETH didn’t see much movement when BTC was consolidating last. “A pretty strong signal that ETH consolidates on these levels and didn’t move while Bitcoin was consolidating. That’s a strong signal that the market sentiment and momentum is rotating towards Ethereum and Altcoins.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Bitcoin is trading for $104,236 at time of writing, a fractional decrease during the last 24 hours.

The market is consolidating, but momentum is building. As state-level crypto policies evolve and DeFi integration grows, the foundations for a price breakout are being laid. The circulating supply of BTC is getting close to 19.88M, and scarcity is a bullish driver. However, beyond supply and demand theory, real-world catalysts are providing traders with new reasons to remain long. Ohio Passes $200 Bitcoin Tax Break, Eyes Senate Vote The Ohio House of Representatives has just passed the Blockchain Basics Act (68–26), providing new protections for crypto users and miners. $200 tax exemption on capital gains for crypto transactions Ban on interference with self-custody wallets Mining protection from discriminatory zoning laws If passed by the Senate, Ohio would lead U.S. states in progressive crypto regulation. This clarity is bullish; it reduces friction for adoption and provides a model for others to follow. Ohio's HB 116 advances with unanimous 13-0 vote in the House Tech Committee.

This has several bullish implications: Reduces the circulating BTC supply, providing long-term price support Shows BTC utility beyond store of value Institutional BTCFi participation grows the ecosystem liquidity As more Bitcoin is locked for staking and institutions explore yield strategies, BTC’s role in decentralized finance is maturing rapidly. Bitcoin Technical Setup: Triangle Apex Nears $105K On the 2-hour chart, BTC is coiling within a classic ascending triangle, forming higher lows with horizontal resistance near $105,000. The 50-EMA at $105,252 acts as a dynamic ceiling. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Momentum indicators suggest a breakout may be imminent.

A breakout above $105,500 could trigger a fresh leg higher in Bitcoin’s 2025 bull run. BTC Bull Token Nears $8.2M Cap as 58% APY Staking Attracts Last-Minute Buyers With BTC trading near $105K, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) .

The current price of $0.00257 is expected to increase once the cap is hit. BTC Bull Token links its value directly to Bitcoin through two core mechanisms: BTC Airdrops reward holders, with presale participants receiving priority. Supply Burns occur automatically every time BTC increases by $50,000, reducing $BTCBULL’s circulating supply. The token also features a 58% APY staking pool holding over 1.81 billion tokens, offering: No lockups or fees Full liquidity Stable passive yields, even in volatile markets This staking model appeals to both DeFi veterans and newcomers seeking hands-off income.

2025-06-19T19:00:15,"Messari Shows Why Flare Innovation Is a Game-Changer for XRP","A new report highlighted by Jungle Inc Crypto News and based on insights from blockchain research firm Messari reveals why Flare Network may be the most transformative force XRP has seen in years. Designed as a “blockchain for data,” Flare is solving some of the most pressing challenges in crypto, unlocking true DeFi utility for XRP without compromising on security or decentralization. A Purpose-Built Chain for Data and Interoperability Flare sets itself apart from other Layer-1 networks by focusing on secure, decentralized data access and cross-chain functionality. Its core architecture features the Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO) and Flare Data Connector (FDC). These native tools allow smart contracts to interact with real-time, verifiable data and assets across multiple blockchains, making Flare a uniquely positioned infrastructure layer in the evolving Web3 ecosystem. Messari Just Covered Flare—and It’s a Game-Changer for XRP ""We’ve been tracking Layer-1 innovation closely, but Flare might be the most underestimated DeFi story of the year."" What if XRP could finally go DeFi—without giving up custody, and without relying on centralized… — Jungle Inc Crypto News (@jungleincxrp) June 19, 2025 FXRP: Non-Custodial XRP for DeFi The introduction of FXRP, a 1:1 representation of XRP on Flare , marks a major breakthrough. Unlike traditional wrapped assets, FXRP is fully non-custodial and enables XRP holders to participate in DeFi—lending, borrowing, farming, and trading—without giving up ownership of their tokens. This innovation is what the community now calls “XRPFi,” and it positions XRP as a first-class citizen in decentralized finance. Rapid Ecosystem Growth and Stablecoin Liquidity Flare’s momentum has accelerated following the integration of USD₮0, an omnichain version of Tether, via LayerZero. In just 13 days, the network’s Total Value Locked (TVL) tripled, surpassing $120 million. This surge in liquidity has energized developers and attracted new users, reinforcing Flare’s role as a viable DeFi hub. Beyond XRP: Expanding Access with FAssets Flare’s impact extends beyond XRP. Through the FAsset protocol, Flare is introducing decentralized access to non-smart contract tokens like Bitcoin (FBTC) and Dogecoin (FDOGE). This approach eliminates the need for centralized bridges and opens DeFi to some of the most widely held cryptocurrencies, significantly expanding the addressable market for the Flare ecosystem. Real Economic Testing on Songbird Before any innovation reaches the Flare mainnet, it undergoes real-world stress testing on Songbird, Flare’s canary network. Unlike typical testnets, Songbird uses assets of real value. FXRP was first launched on Songbird, where it hit its testing cap in just four days—demonstrating both demand and technical readiness. Growing Institutional Interest Flare is also capturing the attention of major institutional players. Uphold, which holds approximately 1.8 billion XRP, is actively engaging with the ecosystem. Meanwhile, VivoPower, a global energy company, is preparing to deploy up to $100 million in XRP through Flare’s infrastructure—evidence of the network’s growing institutional credibility. The Future: Liquid Staking with stXRP Next on the roadmap is Firelight, a protocol enabling liquid staking for FXRP. Users will soon be able to stake FXRP and receive stXRP, a yield-bearing, liquid asset that remains usable across DeFi platforms. Similar to Ethereum’s stETH, stXRP could play a key role in capital-efficient yield generation for XRP holders. Infrastructure, Not Just a Bridge Flare is not merely a bridging solution—it’s a comprehensive, data-secure infrastructure play. With decentralized access to DeFi, institutional engagement, and real-world testing baked into its architecture, Flare could be the catalyst that finally brings XRP into the DeFi mainstream.

2025-06-19T18:49:11,"Top 3 Projects Dominating Headlines as a New Wave of Political and Corporate Adoption Builds","A new surge of interest in the crypto space is being driven by major shifts in political and corporate spheres. Key projects are emerging as frontrunners, capturing headlines and attracting attention. This article reveals the top three contenders poised for significant growth, offering a glimpse into the future of digital currency adoption. Bitcoin Price Update: Range-Bound Trading with Mixed Trends Bitcoin experienced a slight decline of 4.33% over the past week and a near-flat performance with a drop of 0.94% in the last month, while showing a half-year gain of 7.92%. This short-term pullback contrasts with the overall positive momentum observed in recent months, indicating that selling pressure has not fully erased longer-term gains. Modest fluctuations have characterized recent price action, with minor dips amidst the overall recovery. The numbers reflect a resilient coin, as investor sentiment remains cautiously optimistic despite brief setbacks. Bitcoin currently trades within a range between $94,832 and $113,326.80. Immediate support is at $84,880, while resistance is near $121,869.42. Additional support is found at $66,385 and resistance at $140,364. The Awesome Oscillator at -681.90 and Momentum Indicator at -321.30 show a lack of strong bullish momentum, while the RSI at 49.84 indicates a balance between bulls and bears. With no clear trend, traders may look for a breakout above $121,869.42 for bullish opportunities or consider shorting if prices fall below $84,880. Monitoring these levels is essential for timely trading decisions. SOL Price Analysis: Evaluating Trends and Key Levels Solana experienced a decline over the past month with a 14.03% drop and a six-month decrease of 23.16%, while the one-week change reached -9.63%. The trading range stood between $136 and $182, reflecting notable price variability. The coin’s performance indicates a period of downward movement combined with fluctuation in momentum. Solana’s price behavior has shown clear signs of pressure, as seen in the significant percentage changes that signal reduced buying power and an overall bearish sentiment. The current price scenario shows Solana trading between $136 and $182, with immediate resistance at $207.9 and support at $115.84. A secondary resistance is at $253.93, while secondary support is at $69.81. Technical indicators reveal an Awesome Oscillator of -11.948, a Momentum Indicator of -3.38, and an RSI of 43.84, suggesting bears have the upper hand. The market does not signal a clear long-term trend, leaving room for strategic trades as bullish forces attempt to reverse the current downturn. XRP Faces Downtrend with Key Support and Resistance Levels Over the last month, XRP has experienced a significant decline of about 10.6%, while its half-year performance shows a milder drop of approximately 3.0%. Price action fluctuated within a range of $1.95 to $2.53. A one-week decrease close to 5.8% underlined short-term bearish momentum. Technical indicators like the Awesome Oscillator and Momentum Indicator reported negative values, reflecting a lack of buying interest. The relative strength index stayed just below 46, suggesting a slight caution in market activity. These indicators point to a sustained consolidation phase in recent weeks. Currently, XRP is trading under mild pressure. Immediate support is near $1.73, while resistance is noted around $2.88, with a significant upper barrier at $3.45 and lower support at approximately $1.15. Bearish signals dominate from moving averages and oscillators, indicating stronger bear influence. There is no clear upward trend, as prices remain confined within these levels. Traders may consider buying near support for potential rebounds or selling near resistance to secure short-term gains. Monitoring momentum changes around these levels will be crucial for strategic entries and exits. Conclusion BTC , SOL , and XRP are at the forefront as political and corporate interest grows. Each offers unique advantages that attract attention. BTC remains a solid choice for mainstream acceptance. SOL impresses with its rapid transactions and low costs. XRP stands out due to partnerships with financial institutions. This trio is setting new benchmarks in the evolving crypto arena. Attractive features and rising adoption signal a promising future.

Reuters reports that Bitmain, Canaan and MicroBT, the Chinese firms behind over 90% of the global mining rigs that produce Bitcoin, are establishing their US bases to avoid the sweeping tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Bitmain, the largest of the three by sales, started producing US mining rigs in December as a strategic move following Trump’s victory in the November presidential election. Canaan began its trial production in the US following the announcement of the so-called Liberation Day levies as an exploratory initiative to avoid import duties. The third-ranked MicroBT says it is actively implementing a localization strategy to avoid the impact of tariffs. Meanwhile, the US-based Bitcoin mining startup Auradine is pushing to restrict Chinese hardware supplies to boost competition. The firm’s chief strategy officer, Sanjay Gupta, says that while over 30% of Bitcoin mining takes place in North America, more than 90% of the mining hardware comes from China, which represents a major imbalance of geographic demand and supply. Gupta says thousands of Chinese mining rigs are also connected to the US electrical grids, which he says poses a security risk, but Canaan senior executive Leo Wang says the mining rigs do not threaten security because they are useless if not applied to Bitcoin mining.

2025-06-19T18:45:00,"Pi Network Price Prediction 2025-2031: Will Pi Price surpass previous ATH?","Key Takeaways: Pi price faces correction toward $0.53. Our Pi network price prediction expects the Pi price to surge to a maximum level of $1.42 in 2025. In 2031, Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $4.84. Pi Network has entered a period of instability since the final KYC verification deadline on March 14, 2025. Users who failed to verify and transfer their tokens to the mainnet lost access to their Pi holdings. The transition was completed on Pi Day, blockchain upgrades were introduced, and PiFest was launched to help more people use Pi. While some transfers went smoothly for users, others experienced problems and unexpected losses. These complications contributed to sharp price fluctuations. Adding to the pressure, more than 102 million Pi tokens were moved from OKX recently, signalling strong selling activity. Despite this, Pi Network continues to push ecosystem growth. Additionally, the recent launch of a $100 million venture fund aims to support dApp development on the Pi blockchain. While these developments could support long-term value, short-term sentiment remains cautious. In this outlook, we’ll assess how Pi’s price has responded to recent events and provide an informative Pi network price prediction model from 2025 to 2031.

Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction it was still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 in over-the-counter or sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. April 2025 Pi network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. May 2025 , the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi shows sideways-to-bullish movement, with potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72 if support at $0.60 holds.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/pi-network-price-prediction/,"ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","Crypto Price Predictions|Pi Network",cryptocompare

2025-06-19T18:40:04,"Bitcoin Mining: Shocking Dismissal by French Lawmakers on Excess Energy Use Study","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Mining: Shocking Dismissal by French Lawmakers on Excess Energy Use Study The intersection of energy policy and the burgeoning world of cryptocurrency mining is a hot topic globally. In France, a recent development has put a spotlight on this complex relationship, specifically concerning the potential use of the nation’s surplus energy. However, the path forward for exploring this idea seems to have hit a roadblock, at least for now. What Happened with French Energy Policy and Bitcoin Mining? Recent reports from Bitcoin.com News highlight a significant decision made by the French National Assembly. Lawmakers there chose not to move forward with a proposal that would have initiated a study into whether Bitcoin mining could serve as an outlet for the country’s excess energy. This wasn’t a vote on actually *using* energy for mining, but merely on whether to conduct a feasibility study. The proposed amendment, which aimed simply to explore the concept, was reportedly dismissed on procedural grounds. This means the idea didn’t even get a full debate on its potential merits or drawbacks within the assembly. The decision effectively shut down the immediate possibility of a formal governmental exploration into this specific use case for surplus energy. This development is particularly noteworthy given France’s unique energy landscape, which is heavily reliant on nuclear power, providing a stable base load that can sometimes lead to periods of excess generation, especially during low demand periods or when renewable sources are producing strongly. Why Consider Bitcoin Mining for Excess Energy? The idea of using excess energy for Bitcoin mining isn’t new globally. It stems from the fundamental nature of Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism, which requires significant computational power and, consequently, energy. While often criticized for its energy consumption, proponents argue that directing energy that would otherwise be wasted or curtailed towards a productive economic activity like mining offers several potential benefits: Monetizing Waste: Energy grids sometimes produce more power than is immediately needed, particularly from inflexible sources like nuclear or intermittent renewables during peak generation times and low demand. This excess energy can be difficult or costly to store or transmit. Bitcoin mining provides a flexible, interruptible load that can consume this energy, turning a potential liability (wasted energy) into an asset (mined Bitcoin). Grid Stability: Mining operations can potentially act as a form of demand response. They can be powered up quickly when excess energy is available and powered down when the grid needs that power elsewhere, helping to balance supply and demand. This is particularly relevant for managing the variability introduced by growing sources of renewable energy. Funding Renewable Projects: In regions with significant renewable energy production (like hydro, solar, or wind), excess generation is sometimes curtailed (shut down) because the grid cannot absorb it all. Co-locating Bitcoin mining facilities with these projects allows the excess renewable energy to be used on-site, improving the economics of the renewable project and potentially incentivizing further development of sustainable energy infrastructure. Economic Opportunity: Utilizing domestically produced excess energy for mining keeps the economic value generated (the mined Bitcoin) within the country, potentially creating jobs and tax revenue. Decentralized Infrastructure: Bitcoin mining contributes to the security and decentralization of the Bitcoin network, which some view as a strategic advantage. The amendment proposed in France aimed to study these possibilities, exploring the technical, economic, and environmental feasibility within the specific context of the French grid and its energy mix. The procedural dismissal means these potential benefits, at least from a governmental perspective, remain unexamined. What Are the Concerns and Why the Dismissal? While the amendment was dismissed procedurally, preventing a full debate on the merits, there are underlying concerns often raised about Bitcoin mining that likely contribute to such hesitations and regulatory stances, including aspects related to cryptocurrency regulation France might consider in the future. Potential reasons for the resistance or underlying concerns could include: Public Perception and Environmental Concerns: Despite the focus on *excess* energy, Bitcoin mining still carries a public image of being energy-intensive. Lawmakers might be wary of associating a national energy strategy, even for surplus power, with an activity perceived by some as environmentally damaging. Understanding the Technology: The complexities of Bitcoin mining and its potential integration with grid management might not be fully understood by all policymakers, leading to caution or skepticism. Focus on Other Priorities: French energy policy has numerous pressing challenges, including maintaining nuclear infrastructure, developing renewables, ensuring energy security, and managing energy costs for citizens. Exploring a novel use case like Bitcoin mining for excess energy might be seen as a low priority compared to these more traditional concerns. Procedural Hurdles: The specific reason for the procedural dismissal isn’t detailed in the source, but it could relate to how the amendment was drafted, its timing, or its relevance to the specific bill it was attached to. Sometimes, good ideas get sidelined due to parliamentary procedures rather than outright opposition to the concept itself. Regulatory Uncertainty: The broader landscape of cryptocurrency regulation in France and the EU is still evolving. Integrating a decentralized, global activity like Bitcoin mining into national energy infrastructure might raise complex regulatory questions that lawmakers are not yet prepared to address. The lack of a formal study means these concerns, as well as the potential benefits, were not publicly debated or analyzed by the National Assembly. This leaves the door open for continued speculation and debate outside of the official governmental process. French Energy Policy Context: A Quick Look To understand the context of this decision, it’s important to touch upon the specifics of French energy policy. France has historically relied heavily on nuclear power, which provides a large, stable baseload of electricity. This is complemented by hydroelectric power, and increasingly, by solar and wind energy. The nature of nuclear power means it’s not easily ramped up or down in response to short-term demand fluctuations. This can lead to situations where generation exceeds demand, particularly during off-peak hours or mild weather. Furthermore, the growth of intermittent renewables like solar and wind can also create periods of surplus energy generation, especially when windy or sunny conditions coincide with low demand. Managing this variability and utilizing or storing this excess energy efficiently is a key challenge for grid operators everywhere, including France. The amendment likely sought to investigate if Bitcoin mining could be a part of the solution for managing these specific types of surplus energy situations, acting as a flexible load that could be curtailed when the energy is needed elsewhere or when prices rise. What Does This Mean for Cryptocurrency Regulation in France? While this specific decision was about energy use and not direct cryptocurrency regulation France, it reflects a cautious approach by lawmakers towards integrating novel crypto-related activities into established national infrastructure and policy areas. The procedural dismissal suggests either a lack of political will to delve into the topic at this time, or perhaps indicates that the legislative path chosen for the amendment was not the appropriate one. It doesn’t necessarily signal outright hostility towards Bitcoin or crypto, but rather a reluctance to formally explore its potential role in a critical sector like energy without, perhaps, more public pressure, better understanding, or a different political climate. Future discussions around cryptocurrency regulation in France might still touch upon the energy footprint of crypto activities, but this specific avenue for potentially utilizing surplus power has been put on hold. Sustainable Energy and Bitcoin: An Ongoing Debate The debate around Bitcoin’s energy consumption and its relationship with sustainable energy sources is far from settled. Proponents argue that Bitcoin mining can actually *support* the development of renewable energy by providing a ready buyer for otherwise curtailed or stranded power. Critics remain concerned about the overall scale of energy use and the potential for mining to incentivize the use of fossil fuels in other contexts. The French proposal to study using excess energy fits squarely into this debate. It represents an attempt to explore a pathway where Bitcoin mining could be aligned with energy efficiency and sustainability goals, by consuming energy that would otherwise go to waste. The rejection of this study means France is not currently exploring this specific alignment at a governmental level, leaving potential opportunities on the table according to proponents, or avoiding a potentially controversial association according to critics. Looking Ahead: What’s Next? The procedural dismissal of the amendment doesn’t mean the conversation is over. The topic of energy use by cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin mining, is likely to remain a subject of discussion in policy circles, especially as France and the EU continue to grapple with energy security, climate goals, and digital innovation. Future developments could include: Industry-Led Initiatives: The private sector in France might still explore opportunities to use excess energy for mining, perhaps through direct agreements with energy producers or grid operators, independent of governmental studies. Renewed Legislative Efforts: Proponents of the idea could attempt to introduce similar proposals again in the future, perhaps with different phrasing, timing, or attached to different legislation. Broader EU Discussions: Energy and cryptocurrency regulation are often discussed at the EU level. Developments in other member states or directives from Brussels could influence France’s approach. Increased Public and Political Education: A clearer understanding of how Bitcoin mining can be used for grid balancing or consuming otherwise wasted energy might shift perspectives over time. For now, the formal exploration of using France’s excess energy for Bitcoin mining is paused, a result of procedural hurdles rather than a deep dive into the potential benefits and challenges. Summary: A Missed Opportunity for Study? The decision by the French National Assembly to dismiss an amendment proposing a study on using the nation’s excess energy for Bitcoin mining is a notable event in the ongoing global discussion about cryptocurrency’s energy footprint and its potential integration with energy grids. While the dismissal was procedural, it effectively halts official exploration into a concept that proponents argue could offer significant benefits for French energy policy, grid stability, and the monetization of otherwise wasted power. The lack of a formal study leaves the potential advantages, as well as the legitimate concerns regarding environmental perception and technical integration, undiscussed at the governmental level. As France navigates its energy future and the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency regulation France, the question of how best to utilize its excess energy, and whether activities like Bitcoin mining could play a role in promoting sustainable energy goals, remains a fascinating and relevant topic for future consideration.

2025-06-19T18:31:56,"Arthur Hayes Unleashes Stunning $1M Bitcoin Price Prediction by 2028 Fueled by Fed Liquidity","BitcoinWorld Arthur Hayes Unleashes Stunning $1M Bitcoin Price Prediction by 2028 Fueled by Fed Liquidity Hey crypto enthusiasts! Get ready for a bold forecast that’s making waves across the crypto market . Arthur Hayes, the outspoken co-founder of the BitMEX cryptocurrency exchange, recently shared a truly ambitious vision for Bitcoin’s future price trajectory. What’s the Big Prediction from Arthur Hayes? In a candid interview, Arthur Hayes laid out his case for a staggering potential target for Bitcoin. He didn’t just suggest a modest increase; he’s looking at a monumental surge. According to Hayes, the Bitcoin price prediction could see BTC soaring to heights previously thought unimaginable by many. Specifically, Hayes believes Bitcoin could hit: $250,000 by the end of the current year (representing a significant gain from recent levels). A jaw-dropping $1,000,000 (or $1M) by the year 2028 . This isn’t just a random guess; Hayes ties this incredible forecast to specific macroeconomic factors he believes will play out over the coming years. How Does Fed Liquidity Fuel This Massive BTC Price? The core of Hayes’ argument revolves around the actions of the U.S. Federal Reserve. He anticipates a colossal injection of liquidity into the U.S. economy. Here’s the breakdown of his reasoning: Massive Liquidity Injection: Hayes projects that the Federal Reserve will inject approximately $9 trillion in liquidity into the U.S. economy by 2028. Think of this as a significant increase in the money supply or available credit within the system. Flow into Traditional Finance First: This vast pool of liquidity doesn’t immediately rush into crypto. Hayes suggests it will first flow into traditional economic sectors and financial markets. This includes areas like manufacturing and other parts of the ‘real economy’. Spillover into Risk Assets: As this liquidity permeates the traditional system, it eventually seeks higher returns. This leads to capital flowing into ‘risk assets’. What are risk assets? They are investments like stocks, commodities, and yes, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which have the potential for higher returns but also higher volatility compared to safer investments like government bonds. Bitcoin as a Prime Beneficiary: Given its nature as a scarce digital asset often seen as a hedge against inflation or currency devaluation, Bitcoin is positioned, in Hayes’ view, to be a major beneficiary of this liquidity spillover. What About Easing Bank Regulations? Arthur Hayes also pointed to another factor accelerating this process: changes in banking regulations. He noted that easing capital requirements for banks holding U.S. Treasuries is significant. How does this help Bitcoin? Freed-Up Lending Capacity: By requiring banks to hold less capital against their Treasury holdings, it effectively frees up capital that banks can use for lending. Credit Expansion: This increased capacity can drive an expansion of credit throughout the economy. More Fuel for the Fire: This expansion of credit adds another layer of liquidity and capital seeking returns, further contributing to the potential flow into risk assets and ultimately boosting the BTC price . It’s a complex interplay of monetary policy and banking regulations that Hayes believes creates a fertile ground for substantial asset price appreciation, with Bitcoin being a prime candidate for explosive growth. Is a $1M Bitcoin Price Realistic by 2028? Hayes’ prediction is undoubtedly bold and sits at the higher end of many long-term forecasts. While the mechanism he describes – liquidity flowing into risk assets – is a recognized economic principle, the exact scale and timeline are subject to debate. Investors should consider: Macroeconomic conditions can change rapidly. Regulatory environments for crypto are still evolving globally. Bitcoin’s own adoption rate and technological developments will play a role. However, coming from a figure like Arthur Hayes , whose insights often stem from a deep understanding of market structure and global finance, the prediction warrants attention and highlights the potential upside many see for Bitcoin in a world of expanding fiat currency supply. Concluding Thoughts on the $1M BTC Price Target Arthur Hayes’ forecast of Bitcoin reaching $1 million by 2028, driven by anticipated Federal Reserve liquidity and easing bank regulations, paints an incredibly bullish picture for the future of the crypto market . While ambitious, his rationale provides a clear framework rooted in macroeconomic forces. Whether BTC reaches this specific target or not, the prediction underscores the significant potential many experts see for Bitcoin as global liquidity expands. It serves as a powerful reminder of the long-term upside potential that attracts investors to the digital asset space.

2025-06-19T18:30:09,"Ethereum Analyst Eyes High Timeframe Close – Range Break Above $2,800 Could Be Violent","Ethereum is currently facing a pivotal moment as it continues to consolidate below the $3,000 level. Bulls are targeting a breakout above this key resistance zone, which could trigger a major upward move. However, broader market conditions remain fragile. Geopolitical tensions—particularly the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran—continue to create a high-risk macroeconomic environment, leading to increased volatility and intermittent selling pressure across risk assets. Related Reading: Tron Shows Real Growth: Transaction Volume Soars While Success Rate Stays Above 96% Despite these challenges, ETH has shown resilience by holding above the $2,500 support zone. The price has remained locked in a narrow trading range for weeks, reflecting market indecision and caution among participants. According to a technical analysis shared by top analyst Daan, Ethereum continues to trade within this very tight range, with price wicks on both sides consistently getting absorbed. This type of price action signals growing compression, often a precursor to a strong directional move once one side gives in. Traders are now closely monitoring the structure for a higher timeframe close above $2,800, which could validate bullish momentum and open the path toward $3,000 and beyond. Until then, the market appears balanced, and any shift in geopolitical developments may quickly tilt sentiment in either direction. Ethereum Prepares For Breakout as Market Awaits Confirmation Ethereum remains over 60% below its 2024 high of $4,100, but the asset is showing signs of recovery after months of downward pressure and indecision. Bulls have struggled to regain control throughout the year, but recent price action indicates the start of a potential rally. This recovery, however, remains tentative and will require confirmation through a higher timeframe close above critical resistance levels, particularly the $2,800–$3,000 range. The broader environment continues to weigh heavily on sentiment. Escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, coupled with macroeconomic uncertainty—including rising U.S. Treasury yields and concerns about inflation—are creating headwinds for risk assets, Ethereum included. Despite this, ETH has managed to hold key support above the $2,500 level, a sign that bulls are defending their ground. According to technical analysis shared by analyst Daan, Ethereum is currently trading within a very tight range, with price wicks on both sides being consistently absorbed. This type of compression typically signals an incoming surge in volatility. Daan notes that once one side gives in, the resulting move often becomes explosive and sustained. The current range-bound action reflects equilibrium between buyers and sellers, but that balance won’t last forever. Traders are watching closely for a decisive higher timeframe close above resistance—or below support—as confirmation of the next trend direction. With ETH positioned near major technical zones, a breakout could lead to significant momentum, potentially bringing Ethereum closer to reclaiming the psychological $3,000 mark and reigniting a push toward cycle highs. Until then, the market remains in a wait-and-see mode. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidates as Realized Profits Stay Low – No Signs Of Major Sell-Off Yet Ethereum Continues Range-Bound Trading As Key Support Holds Ethereum (ETH) remains locked in a tight range between approximately $2,500 and $2,800, showing little directional clarity over the past several weeks. The chart above (12-hour timeframe) reflects persistent consolidation with multiple wicks on both ends of the candles, indicating absorption of both bullish and bearish momentum. This suggests that neither buyers nor sellers have taken firm control. ETH currently trades near $2,540 and is holding above the 100-period simple moving average (SMA), which is acting as short-term support. The 50 SMA has flattened, further reinforcing the sideways nature of the price action. Volume has also tapered off, typical in compression phases that often precede strong breakouts or breakdowns. If ETH fails to reclaim the $2,675–$2,800 resistance zone, the 200 SMA near $2,117 may become relevant as a deeper support target. However, as long as ETH maintains price action above $2,500, bulls are still in play. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Strong Despite Israel-Iran Tensions – Weekly Resistance Begins To Crack The structure suggests that Ethereum is building energy for a decisive move. A higher timeframe close above $2,800 could trigger a new leg up toward $3,000 and beyond. Conversely, a break below $2,500 could lead to renewed bearish pressure. For now, traders are watching for breakout confirmation.

2025-06-19T18:13:23,"Binance price outlook: Can BNB break out of the $400–$800 range?","Binance continues to trade sideways in a tightly defined high time frame range, with $800 as resistance and $400 as support. As this range matures, the likelihood of a major breakout, or breakdown, increases. Until then, traders should prepare for continued oscillation and plan around key levels. Binance ( BNB ) has been consolidating for weeks, and the structure shows no signs of an immediate breakout. However, the ongoing sideways action is setting the stage for a larger volatility expansion in the near future once resistance or support breaks. Key technical points Range High: $800 resistance with deviation and rejection confirmed Range Low: $400 support, aligning with the 200 MA and 0.618 Fibonacci retracement Rotational Structure: Price action has respected both edges of the range, creating a clear oscillation pattern BNBUSDT (1W) Chart, Source: TradingView The $800 region is acting as a strong resistance level, with price failing to close convincingly above it. A clear deviation from this level has already occurred, confirming a rejection and a rotation back into the mid-range. This resistance aligns with the value area high and sits just above the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, both adding to its technical significance. You might also like: Musk’s X to offer investment and trading in ‘super app’: report If price continues to reject around this high time frame resistance, the probability increases for a full range rotation back to the $400 support. This support is a key technical zone, it coincides with the 200-day moving average and another 0.618 Fibonacci level, and it also holds untapped liquidity built over the past several months. A test of this area would offer a clean sweep of downside liquidity, potentially setting the stage for a stronger bullish reaction. BNB remains firmly within a rotational range structure, and no breakout has yet occurred. For long-term investors and swing traders, the optimal long opportunity likely lies near the $400 mark, should price revisit that level with confirmation. Until then, entering mid-range positions carries unnecessary risk. What to expect in the coming price action Unless BNB breaks above $800 or loses the $400 support, price is expected to continue ranging. Traders should focus on the edges of the range for positioning, with $400 acting as the ideal accumulation zone and $800 as the breakout trigger. Until a clear shift in structure appears, range-bound strategies remain favorable.
