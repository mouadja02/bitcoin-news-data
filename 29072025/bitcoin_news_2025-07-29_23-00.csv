2025-07-29T20:56:09,"Why Are In-Kind Redemptions Important in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs That Were Approved by the SEC Minutes Ago? Here‚Äôs How They Benefit the Industry","Greg Xethalis, Chief Legal Counsel at Multicoin Capital Management, highlighted the importance of the decision regarding the ‚Äúin-kind creation and redemption‚Äù process for cryptocurrency spot ETFs, which the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved minutes ago. Xethalis stated that this decision by the SEC is a significant turning point for the crypto asset markets and explained four main benefits: Standard Compliance: Stating that the decision brings crypto asset ETFs in line with physical commodity ETFs such as gold, Xethalis stated that authorized participants (AP) will be able to deliver and purchase assets in kind through their subsidiaries. Increased Regulatory Oversight: Xethalis stated that in-kind transactions will be conducted on behalf of regulated brokerage firms rather than unregulated funds, and that this will provide greater regulatory oversight in crypto asset buying and selling processes. Tax and Market Efficiency: Xethalis stated that in-kind creation and redemption transactions create a more efficient market environment for fund shareholders, and that most ETFs with a Grantor Trust structure can operate in this way without creating a tax burden. Related News: BREAKING: Historic Moment - SEC Approves In-Kind Redemptions for Bitcoin and Ethereum Spot ETFs Reduced Manipulation Risk: Xethalis also stated that large-scale redemption and creation transactions will be conducted more transparently, not only for cash-based funds but also for in-kind funds. This, he stated, makes it more difficult for theoretical price manipulations to occur around the creation/redemption process of ETF shares. According to Xethalis, this move by the SEC is a significant gain not only in terms of market efficiency but also in terms of investor protection and structural integrity. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-29T20:55:06,"Visa, PayPal, and Marathon Digital records strong earnings for Q2 2025","Visa, PayPal, and Marathon Digital each reported their Q2 earnings Tuesday, with all three companies beating analyst expectations on revenue and income. Spotify, however, missed both targets and issued weaker guidance, triggering a sharp drop in share price. Visa reported an adjusted net income of $5.8 billion, or $2.98 per share, for its fiscal third quarter ending June 30, beating the $2.85 average estimate from analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue rose 14% year-over-year to $10.2 billion, a new company record. The San Francisco-based payments giant also reported a 12% jump in cross-border volumes and a 10% rise in processed transactions. CEO Ryan McInerney said Tuesday, ‚ÄúConsumer spending remains resilient, with continued strength in discretionary and non-discretionary growth in the US.‚Äù McInerney also said Visa saw ‚Äúhealthy business driver trends‚Äù carry into the current quarter. Despite the strong numbers, Visa stock dipped 0.9% to $348 in after-hours trading. The stock had gained 11% year-to-date through Tuesday, ahead of the S&P 500 Financials Index, which rose 9.1% over the same stretch. The company left its earnings guidance unchanged for the full fiscal year, still expecting low double-digit revenue growth and earnings per share to rise in the low teens percentage range. PayPal revenue rises, but cash flow drops sharply PayPal posted Q2 adjusted earnings per share of $1.40, ahead of the $1.30 analysts had forecast, based on LSEG data. Revenue hit $8.29 billion, beating the $8.08 billion estimate. Sales were up 5% year-over-year from $7.89 billion. But the headline wasn‚Äôt enough to hold up the stock‚Äîshares dropped over 8% after the company flagged concerns in its profitability metrics. The company‚Äôs transaction margin dollars rose 7% to $3.84 billion, marking the sixth straight quarter of growth. But that growth had slowed from the previous quarter, where it was 8% excluding one-time boosts. Branded checkout volumes also decelerated to 5%, down from 6% in Q1 when adjusted for Leap Day. CEO Alex Chriss has been cutting out lower-margin revenue streams, but rising expenses and weaker cash flow have overshadowed topline gains. Operating expenses rose to $6.78 billion, up from $6.26 billion in Q1. Adjusted free cash flow crashed to $656 million, which was less than half the prior quarter‚Äôs $1.4 billion and roughly one-third of analyst expectations. Despite the slowdown, PayPal reported total payment volume of $443.6 billion, beating the $433.6 billion expected. Active accounts increased by 2% to 438 million, just above forecasts. The company‚Äôs shares are down 8.4% for the year as of Tuesday‚Äôs close, while the Nasdaq is up around 10% in 2025. Looking ahead, PayPal guided Q3 earnings to a range of $1.18 to $1.22 per share, with analysts expecting $1.20. Transaction margin dollars are expected to grow 4% to between $3.76 billion and $3.82 billion. Marathon smashes estimates with 505% net income growth Marathon Digital Holdings delivered one of the most aggressive Q2 earnings results this season. The crypto miner reported a 64% jump in revenue to $238 million and a massive 505% rise in net income to $808.2 million compared to the previous year. The company‚Äôs Bitcoin holdings rose by 170%, with 18,488 BTC on the books, up from 6,841 BTC a year earlier. That‚Äôs an increase of 49,951 BTC mined in a single quarter. The company attributed the spike to better mining efficiency and expanded infrastructure. Marathon said in a shareholder letter that it would hold a webcast at 5:00 p.m. ET to discuss the results. Before the announcement, options traders leaned bullish with five calls for every two puts, and implied volatility pointed to an expected move of about 6.8%, or $1.13 per share, a number consistent with MARA‚Äôs average 9.1% swing post-earnings over the past eight quarters. While analyst forecasts had pinned Marathon‚Äôs Q2 revenue at $137.6 million with $0.11 EPS, the company blew past both figures. Still, not everything was smooth under the hood. Marathon posted a 12-month revenue decline of 6.4%, and its operating margin sat at -79.37%, with net margin at -46.68%. There were also liquidity concerns. The company‚Äôs current ratio is 0.79, which means it may not have enough short-term assets to cover short-term liabilities. However, with a $5.86 billion market cap and investments in immersion cooling and custom firmware, Marathon has leaned heavily into tech upgrades to stay competitive. Shares of MARA were up 4.76% in after-hours, trading at $16.61 at last check. Spotify reports loss, stock sinks more than 11% Spotify posted one of its worst days in a year after the company missed Q2 expectations and issued weak guidance for Q3. Shares fell more than 11% on Tuesday, marking their sharpest single-day drop since July 2023. The streaming platform reported a net loss of 86 million euros, or 42 euro cents per share, versus 1.90 euros per share expected by analysts. Revenue came in at 4.19 billion euros, falling short of the 4.26 billion euro forecast. Still, revenue rose 10% year-over-year, up from 3.81 billion euros. Last year, the company had posted net income of 225 million euros, or 1.10 euros per share, showing a clear reversal. Spotify said the disappointing results were due to higher personnel, marketing, and professional services costs, along with 115 million euros in social charges. The Q3 forecast was also weak. Spotify expects revenue of 4.2 billion euros, missing the 4.47 billion euro estimate. The company blamed foreign exchange headwinds, estimating a 490-basis-point drag on guidance.

2025-07-29T20:45:06,"Kyrgyzstan registers crypto transactions worth $7 billion","The volume of crypto asset transactions in Kyrgyzstan has reached $7 billion, according to the head of the nation‚Äôs state-controlled investment agency. The official announced the figure at a meeting with the top U.S. representative in his country, during which cryptocurrency was among the main topics. The news comes after recent reports indicating the former Soviet Republic is being used by Russia to bypass war-related sanctions, including by trading through its crypto exchanges. Kyrgyzstan unveils total value of domestic crypto transactions The digital economy, and the crypto market in particular, was the focus of recent talks between the Director of Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs National Investments Agency (NIA), Farkhat Iminov, and the American Ambassador to Bishkek, Lesslie Viguerie, the local news outlet Knews reported. During the meeting, Iminov reminded the U.S. diplomat that the Kyrgyz Republic regulated its cryptocurrency sector in 2022, with the adoption of the law ‚ÄúOn Virtual Assets.‚Äù By the end of 2024, the crypto turnover registered in the country amounted to $7 billion in value, highlighted the head of the state agency, which is subordinated directly to President Sadyr Zhaparov‚Äôs administration. Kyrgyzstan is considered a leader in Central Asia when it comes to the development of blockchain technologies, cryptocurrency mining, digital assets in general, and artificial intelligence (AI), the report pointed out. In that context, the U.S. ambassador noted in positive terms the introduction of the digital som, the central bank digital currency (CBDC) issued by the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic. Viguerie described its launch as one of the most innovative steps in the region, an indication of Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs desire for digital transformation. According to a press release, the two sides discussed current investment initiatives and prospective joint projects, with the American representative emphasizing the importance of Washington‚Äôs help in simplifying procedures related to doing business in the country. The Kyrgyz official remarked that his agency acts as an intermediary between businesses and state institutions, while signaling its readiness to assist U.S. and other partners in implementing investment projects in Kyrgyzstan. What about Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs role in Russia‚Äôs sanctions evasion? The formal statements during the meeting, quoted by the NIA‚Äôs press service, did not reveal whether Iminov and Viguerie discussed allegations that Russia has been using Kyrgyz crypto platforms to circumvent Western financial and trade restrictions. In a recently published report on the matter, the blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs said it had ‚Äúidentified a growing pattern of Russian actors exploiting the country to evade sanctions and procure dual-use goods for the war in Ukraine.‚Äù It elaborated: ‚ÄúKyrgyz-registered exchanges have repeatedly facilitated transactions linked to sanctioned Russian entities. Many of these virtual asset service providers show indicators of being shell companies.‚Äù Some of these coin trading venues, TRM added, exert behavior similar to that of Garantex, the sanctioned Russian exchange which was taken down by U.S. law enforcement in March. Grinex, another high-risk exchange believed to have succeeded Garantex, was also registered in Kyrgyzstan. Mere weeks after Garantex went offline, Grinex started processing withdrawals with a Russian stablecoin called A7A5. According to an article by the Financial Times, the ruble-pegged digital currency has been used to transfer over $9 billion worth of assets in a period of four months. The stablecoin was launched, again in Kyrgyzstan, by Ilan Sor, a fugitive Moldovan oligarch. Its reserve assets were deposited at Promsvyazbank, one of Russia‚Äôs banks placed under sanctions by both the United States and the European Union. ‚ÄúOn-chain analysis suggests that Grinex and other Kyrgyz-based exchanges may have played a role in moving funds after the takedown [of Garantex], underscoring Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs growing importance as a conduit for post-sanctions Russian financial activity,‚Äù TRM Labs noted.

2025-07-29T20:40:10,"Crypto ETPs: Unlocking Revolutionary In-Kind Transactions","BitcoinWorld Crypto ETPs: Unlocking Revolutionary In-Kind Transactions The world of digital assets is constantly evolving, and regulatory decisions often serve as powerful catalysts for change. Recently, a significant announcement has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency investment landscape: the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved in-kind creations and redemptions for crypto ETPs . This move, initially reported by Unfolded on X, represents a pivotal shift in how these exchange-traded products operate and could redefine investor access to digital assets. But what exactly does this mean for you, for the market, and for the future of cryptocurrency investments? Let‚Äôs dive deep into this groundbreaking development. Understanding In-Kind Transactions for Crypto ETPs To truly grasp the magnitude of the SEC‚Äôs decision, it‚Äôs essential to understand what ‚Äòin-kind‚Äô transactions entail, especially in the context of crypto ETPs . Traditionally, many ETPs operate on a ‚Äòcash‚Äô creation and redemption model. This means that when an authorized participant (AP) wants to create new shares of an ETP, they send cash to the issuer, who then uses that cash to buy the underlying assets (e.g., Bitcoin). Conversely, when shares are redeemed, the AP receives cash in return for the shares, and the issuer sells the underlying assets. In contrast, ‚Äòin-kind‚Äô transactions involve the direct exchange of the underlying assets themselves. For crypto ETPs , this means: Creation: An authorized participant provides the actual cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum) directly to the ETP issuer in exchange for new ETP shares. Redemption: An authorized participant returns ETP shares to the issuer and receives the corresponding amount of the underlying cryptocurrency directly. This method has long been the standard for traditional commodity-backed ETPs, like gold ETFs, where physical gold is exchanged. Its approval for crypto ETPs signals a growing maturity and regulatory comfort with digital assets. Why is the SEC‚Äôs Approval for Crypto ETPs So Significant? The SEC‚Äôs green light for in-kind transactions for crypto ETPs isn‚Äôt just a technical tweak; it‚Äôs a foundational change with far-reaching implications. For years, the SEC has approached crypto-related products with caution, prioritizing investor protection and market integrity. This approval suggests a significant step forward in their understanding and acceptance of digital asset mechanics within regulated financial products. This decision could be seen as a vote of confidence in the operational robustness and security frameworks surrounding digital asset custody. It streamlines the process for issuers and authorized participants, potentially leading to more efficient and liquid markets for these products. It also aligns the operational structure of crypto ETPs more closely with their traditional commodity counterparts, paving the way for broader institutional adoption. What Are the Key Benefits of In-Kind Transactions for Crypto ETPs? The shift to in-kind transactions for crypto ETPs brings a host of advantages for both investors and the broader market ecosystem. These benefits contribute to a more robust, efficient, and potentially cost-effective investment vehicle. Enhanced Efficiency and Cost-Effectiveness: By directly exchanging crypto for ETP shares (and vice-versa), the need for cash conversions is eliminated. This can reduce transaction costs, brokerage fees, and the spreads associated with buying and selling the underlying cryptocurrency. It simplifies the operational flow for authorized participants, which can translate into lower expense ratios for investors. Reduced Tracking Error: One of the primary goals of an ETP is to closely track the price of its underlying asset. Cash-based models can introduce ‚Äòtracking error‚Äô due to timing differences between cash transfers and crypto purchases/sales, as well as market volatility during these windows. In-kind transactions significantly minimize this risk, as the direct exchange ensures the ETP‚Äôs net asset value (NAV) remains tightly aligned with the underlying crypto‚Äôs price. Improved Market Liquidity: The ability to directly create and redeem shares with crypto can enhance the liquidity of the ETP itself. Authorized participants can more easily arbitrage price discrepancies between the ETP and the spot crypto market, ensuring that the ETP‚Äôs price stays close to its fair value. This robust arbitrage mechanism benefits all investors by maintaining tighter bid-ask spreads. Potential Tax Advantages: In some jurisdictions, in-kind redemptions can offer tax efficiencies. When an authorized participant redeems shares in-kind, they receive the underlying asset, which may not trigger a taxable event until that asset is subsequently sold. This contrasts with cash redemptions, which always involve a sale of the underlying asset by the issuer, potentially creating capital gains that are then distributed to shareholders. (Note: Investors should always consult with a tax professional regarding their specific situation.) Broader Institutional Adoption of Crypto ETPs: For large institutional investors, operational efficiency and direct asset handling are crucial. The in-kind model makes crypto ETPs more appealing by mirroring the structures they are accustomed to in traditional markets. This could encourage more institutional capital to flow into these products, further legitimizing the crypto asset class. What Challenges Might In-Kind Crypto ETPs Face? While the approval of in-kind transactions for crypto ETPs is overwhelmingly positive, it‚Äôs important to acknowledge potential challenges and considerations that may arise as this model becomes more prevalent. Regulatory Nuances and Evolving Landscape: While the U.S. SEC has approved this, regulatory frameworks for crypto assets are still evolving globally. Issuers and authorized participants operating across different jurisdictions might face varying rules regarding custody, settlement, and reporting for in-kind transactions. Operational Complexities for Issuers: Managing direct cryptocurrency transfers, especially at scale, requires robust technological infrastructure, stringent security protocols, and efficient reconciliation processes. Issuers must ensure they have the expertise and systems in place to handle large volumes of digital asset movements securely. Custody and Security Concerns: The direct handling of cryptocurrencies in large quantities amplifies the importance of secure custody solutions. ETP issuers must rely on highly reputable and audited crypto custodians to minimize risks associated with hacks, theft, or loss of private keys. Market Volatility and Price Impact: While in-kind transactions reduce tracking error, the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies still presents a challenge. Large in-kind creations or redemptions could, in extreme cases, still exert some pressure on the underlying spot markets, though this is typically mitigated by the arbitrage process. Looking Ahead: The Future Landscape for Crypto ETPs The SEC‚Äôs approval of in-kind transactions marks a significant milestone, suggesting a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies within mainstream financial products. This decision could pave the way for a new generation of crypto ETPs that are more efficient, liquid, and attractive to a broader range of investors, including large institutions. We might see an expansion of product offerings, potentially including ETPs for a wider variety of cryptocurrencies beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum, as regulatory clarity improves. The operational efficiencies gained could also foster greater competition among issuers, potentially leading to lower fees and more innovative product designs. The future of crypto ETPs appears increasingly bright and integrated with traditional finance. Actionable Insights for Investors: Navigating the World of Crypto ETPs For investors considering adding crypto ETPs to their portfolios, this development offers a more refined investment vehicle. Here are some actionable insights: Understand the Underlying Asset: Always research the specific cryptocurrency that the ETP tracks. Understand its use case, technology, and market dynamics. Assess the Issuer and Custodian: Look into the reputation and track record of the ETP issuer and their chosen crypto custodian. Security and operational excellence are paramount. Review Expense Ratios: While in-kind models can reduce costs, compare the expense ratios of different ETPs to ensure you‚Äôre getting competitive pricing. Consider Your Investment Horizon: Cryptocurrencies are known for their volatility. Determine if investing in crypto ETPs aligns with your risk tolerance and long-term financial goals. Stay Informed: The regulatory landscape for digital assets is dynamic. Keep abreast of new developments, regulatory changes, and market trends that could impact your investments. A New Era for Digital Asset Investments The SEC‚Äôs approval of in-kind transactions for crypto ETPs is more than just a procedural update; it‚Äôs a testament to the maturation of the digital asset space and its increasing integration into the regulated financial system. By fostering greater efficiency, liquidity, and potentially better tax outcomes, this decision unlocks new possibilities for investors seeking exposure to cryptocurrencies through familiar and regulated investment vehicles. It‚Äôs a game-changer that could accelerate institutional adoption and further solidify the presence of digital assets in diversified investment portfolios worldwide. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are in-kind transactions in the context of crypto ETPs? A1: In-kind transactions for crypto ETPs mean that authorized participants (APs) exchange the actual underlying cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin) directly with the ETP issuer for ETP shares, rather than using cash. Similarly, for redemptions, APs return ETP shares and receive the cryptocurrency directly. Q2: How do in-kind transactions differ from cash transactions for crypto ETPs? A2: Cash transactions involve APs sending cash to the issuer, who then buys the crypto, or vice versa. In-kind transactions bypass the cash step, directly exchanging the cryptocurrency for ETP shares, which can reduce costs and tracking error. Q3: What are the main benefits of this SEC approval for crypto ETPs? A3: Key benefits include enhanced efficiency, reduced tracking error, improved market liquidity, potential tax advantages for investors, and increased appeal for institutional investors, all contributing to a more robust market for crypto ETPs . Q4: Are there any risks associated with in-kind crypto ETPs? A4: While beneficial, challenges include navigating complex regulatory nuances across jurisdictions, ensuring robust operational security for handling cryptocurrencies, and managing the inherent volatility of digital assets. Q5: Will this approval lead to more crypto ETPs in the U.S.? A5: This approval is a significant step towards greater regulatory comfort and operational efficiency, making it highly probable that more crypto ETPs , potentially tracking a wider range of cryptocurrencies, will be introduced and approved in the U.S. market.

2025-07-29T20:30:29,"China‚Äôs JD.com Registers Trademarks for JCOIN and JOYCOIN","JD.com, a Chinese e-commerce company, has registered trademarks for ‚ÄúJCOIN‚Äù and ‚ÄúJOYCOIN‚Äù in hopes of a stablecoin push. This has led to speculation that the company may launch its stablecoins. Reports suggest that these names could be linked to JD.com‚Äôs future digital assets, indicating the company‚Äôs potential entry into the growing stablecoin market. JD.com Move Signals Potential Stablecoin Launch Recall that it was reported that the technology-driven company is preparing to launch a new digital currency called the JD Stablecoin. This stablecoin will be linked to the Hong Kong dollar (HKD) at a 1:1 ratio. Notably, JD stablecoin will be issued on a public blockchain, ensuring transparency and decentralized validation. Meanwhile, the newly filed trademarks for JCOIN and JOYCOIN will cover various crypto-related services like fund transfers using blockchain, digital payments, and cryptocurrency transactions. This means JD.com is also getting ready to offer crypto and blockchain financial services. It is also worth noting that the e-commerce giant‚Äôs trademark registration comes at an important time, as Hong Kong‚Äôs rules for stablecoins take effect on August 1. These rules will provide clear guidelines for companies that issue stablecoins. Hong Kong Vows to Stay Open for Digital Assets In February 2025, Hong Kong‚Äôs financial secretary, Paul Chan Mo-po, reaffirmed the city‚Äôs commitment to becoming a leading crypto-friendly financial center. He stated that the country remains open and dedicated to digital assets, emphasizing its investment in Web3 infrastructure and talent development. His remarks highlight the city‚Äôs efforts to position itself as a regional crypto hub , distinguishing itself from mainland China‚Äôs strict anti-crypto stance. Hong Kong has introduced crypto-friendly policies. This includes a proposal to exempt hedge funds, private equity, and family offices from crypto capital gains taxes. Hence, attracting institutional investment. Understanding Stablecoin Regulatory Trends Interestingly, the stablecoin market has gained nearly $4 billion, pushing its total market capitalization above $264 billion. This surge is closely tied to the regulatory clarity the GENIUS Act provides. While all stablecoins share the goal of maintaining a stable value, they differ significantly in their methods. These tokens generally fall into four categories: fiat-backed, crypto-backed, algorithmic, and commodity-backed. Fiat-backed stablecoins, pegged 1:1 to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar and backed by short-term government securities, dominate the market. They comprise 85% of the total stablecoin supply. Crypto-backed stablecoins, such as DAI, use overcollateralized crypto assets like Ethereum (ETH) and tokenized Bitcoin (BTC) to maintain stability. Meanwhile, algorithmic stablecoins adjust supply automatically to maintain their peg. Commodity-backed stablecoins, like Pax Gold, offer backing by assets such as gold and appeal to those seeking an inflation hedge. However, they may face challenges related to liquidity and custody.

2025-07-29T20:30:11,"Urgent: Market Downturn Drags US Stocks Lower ‚Äì What Does It Mean for Your Crypto?","BitcoinWorld Urgent: Market Downturn Drags US Stocks Lower ‚Äì What Does It Mean for Your Crypto? The financial world often feels like a giant interconnected web, and when one major part experiences a tremor, the ripples can be felt far and wide. Recently, the three major U.S. stock indexes‚Äîthe S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones‚Äîall closed lower, signaling a notable Market Downturn in traditional finance. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, this immediate news often sparks a crucial question: What does this mean for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the broader digital asset landscape? While crypto markets have often marched to their own beat, their increasing integration with traditional finance means these movements are rarely isolated. Let‚Äôs delve into the specifics of this market shift and explore its potential implications for your crypto portfolio. What Exactly Caused This Market Downturn in US Stocks? The recent dip in major U.S. stock indexes wasn‚Äôt an isolated event but rather the culmination of several macroeconomic factors creating a cautious sentiment among investors. Understanding these drivers is key to grasping the broader financial climate and how it might influence digital assets. On the day of the close, the numbers painted a clear picture of declining confidence: S&P 500: -0.30% Nasdaq: -0.38% Dow Jones: -0.46% These seemingly small percentages represent billions of dollars in lost market capitalization and reflect underlying concerns. But what exactly is fueling this Market Downturn ? Several key factors are often cited: Inflationary Pressures: Persistent inflation remains a significant concern. When the cost of goods and services rises steadily, it erodes purchasing power and can lead central banks to take action. Interest Rate Hikes: To combat inflation, central banks, like the U.S. Federal Reserve, typically raise interest rates. While necessary to cool down an overheating economy, higher rates increase borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, which can slow economic growth and reduce corporate profits, thus impacting stock valuations. Recession Fears: The aggressive stance on interest rates often sparks fears of a potential economic recession. A recession implies a significant decline in economic activity, leading to job losses and reduced consumer spending, which directly impacts corporate earnings and investor confidence. Geopolitical Tensions: Ongoing global events, such as conflicts or trade disputes, can create uncertainty and volatility in financial markets. These tensions can disrupt supply chains, impact commodity prices, and generally make investors more risk-averse. Corporate Earnings Outlook: Companies‚Äô ability to meet or exceed earnings expectations is a major driver of stock prices. If the outlook for corporate profits is dim due to economic headwinds, investors may sell off shares, contributing to a broader Market Downturn . These intertwined factors create a complex environment where traditional assets face headwinds, prompting investors to re-evaluate their portfolios. How Does a Stock Market Downturn Influence Cryptocurrency? For a long time, many believed cryptocurrencies were entirely uncorrelated with traditional markets, acting as a separate asset class. However, as digital assets have matured and gained mainstream adoption, this narrative has evolved. A significant Market Downturn in traditional stocks can indeed send ripples, or even waves, through the crypto space. Here‚Äôs how this influence typically manifests: Risk-Off Sentiment: In times of economic uncertainty or fear, investors often adopt a ‚Äòrisk-off‚Äô approach. This means they tend to sell riskier assets and move into safer havens, like government bonds or even cash. Cryptocurrencies, despite their potential, are still largely perceived as high-risk assets, especially by institutional investors. When the broader market sees a decline, crypto often follows suit as investors de-risk their portfolios across the board. Liquidity Crunch: A traditional market sell-off can create a demand for liquidity. Investors might sell their crypto holdings, even at a loss, to cover margin calls in other markets or to simply raise cash. This increased selling pressure can exacerbate a crypto Market Downturn . Institutional Overlap: The entry of institutional investors into the crypto space has increased the correlation. Large funds and corporations that hold both traditional stocks and digital assets might rebalance their portfolios in response to a traditional market dip, leading to synchronized movements. Investor Psychology: Market sentiment is highly contagious. A pessimistic outlook in the stock market can easily spill over into the crypto community, leading to fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) which can trigger panic selling regardless of crypto-specific fundamentals. While Bitcoin (often dubbed ‚Äòdigital gold‚Äô) has, at times, shown signs of decoupling, especially during periods of high inflation where it‚Äôs seen as a hedge, the short-term reality is often different. In the immediate aftermath of a significant Market Downturn in stocks, crypto tends to experience similar pressures. This highlights the growing interconnectedness of global financial systems. Navigating the Market Downturn: Strategies for Crypto Investors When faced with a Market Downturn , whether in traditional stocks or crypto, panic can be a dangerous advisor. Instead, a well-thought-out strategy based on sound principles can help protect your portfolio and even position you for future growth. Here are some actionable insights for crypto investors: 1. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): This fundamental principle becomes even more critical during volatile periods. Understand the projects you‚Äôre invested in. Are they building robust technology? Do they have strong communities and clear use cases? Strong fundamentals can help a project weather the storm better than speculative assets. 2. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market (which is notoriously difficult), consider investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, regardless of price. When prices are low during a Market Downturn , your fixed investment buys more assets, effectively lowering your average purchase price over time. This strategy mitigates the risk of investing a large sum at a market peak. 3. Rebalance Your Portfolio: A downturn is an excellent time to reassess your asset allocation. If certain assets have performed poorly, you might consider trimming them or, conversely, accumulating more if you believe in their long-term potential. Ensure your portfolio aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. 4. Focus on the Long Term (HODL): Many seasoned crypto investors advocate for a ‚ÄòHODL‚Äô (Hold On for Dear Life) strategy during bear markets. Cryptocurrencies are known for their volatility, but historically, they have also demonstrated remarkable resilience and recovery. If your investment thesis is long-term, short-term price fluctuations from a Market Downturn become less significant. 5. Secure Your Assets: Volatility can sometimes bring increased security risks. Ensure your crypto assets are stored securely in hardware wallets or reputable, cold storage solutions. Avoid leaving large amounts on exchanges unless actively trading. 6. Avoid Emotional Decisions: Fear and greed are powerful emotions that can lead to poor investment choices. Stick to your pre-defined investment plan and avoid making impulsive decisions based on daily price swings or sensational news headlines. Acknowledge that corrections are a natural part of market cycles. Beyond the Immediate: What‚Äôs the Long-Term Outlook After a Market Downturn? While the immediate impact of a Market Downturn can be unsettling, it‚Äôs crucial to adopt a long-term perspective, especially in the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency. Historically, market corrections and even bear markets have often paved the way for future innovation and growth. Here‚Äôs what the long-term outlook might entail: Shakeout of Weak Projects: Downturns tend to weed out speculative projects with weak fundamentals. This ‚Äòsurvival of the fittest‚Äô scenario often leaves stronger, more resilient projects poised for future success. It‚Äôs an opportunity for the ecosystem to mature. Continued Innovation: Bear markets are often dubbed ‚Äòbuilder markets.‚Äô Developers and teams continue to innovate, refine technology, and build new applications regardless of price action. These periods of intense development lay the groundwork for the next bull run. Increased Adoption: Despite price volatility, the underlying technology and use cases for blockchain and cryptocurrencies continue to gain traction. Institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and real-world applications are steadily expanding, which bodes well for the long-term health of the industry. Market Cycles are Natural: Financial markets operate in cycles. Periods of growth are followed by corrections, and vice versa. Understanding this cyclical nature helps investors manage expectations and prepare for both bull and bear phases. A Market Downturn is not an end but a phase. Ultimately, while traditional market movements can create short-term turbulence for crypto, the long-term trajectory of digital assets is increasingly tied to technological advancements, regulatory frameworks, and broader societal adoption. Prudent investors will focus on these foundational elements rather than succumbing to the fleeting anxieties of a temporary downturn. Summary: Navigating the Waves of Change The recent dip in U.S. stock indexes serves as a powerful reminder of the interconnectedness of global financial markets. While a Market Downturn in traditional finance can indeed send tremors through the cryptocurrency space, it also presents an opportunity for informed investors to re-evaluate their strategies. By understanding the underlying causes, acknowledging the correlations, and employing disciplined investment tactics like dollar-cost averaging and focusing on long-term fundamentals, you can navigate these challenging times with greater confidence. Remember, market volatility is a constant, but resilience and knowledge are your strongest assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a Market Downturn and how does it differ from a recession? A Market Downturn refers to a significant decline in stock market prices, typically 10% or more from recent highs. A recession, on the other hand, is a broader economic contraction characterized by a significant decline in economic activity across the economy, lasting more than a few months, visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales. Q2: Is the cryptocurrency market always correlated with the stock market during a downturn? While historically there have been periods of decoupling, especially for Bitcoin, the increasing institutional adoption and mainstream integration of cryptocurrencies have led to a higher correlation with traditional markets, particularly during significant economic events or a broad Market Downturn . Crypto assets are still largely considered risk-on assets. Q3: What are some safe-haven assets during a Market Downturn? Traditionally, safe-haven assets include gold, certain government bonds (like U.S. Treasuries), and sometimes the U.S. dollar. While some argue Bitcoin could become a digital safe-haven, its volatility means it doesn‚Äôt yet consistently fulfill this role during severe market stress. Q4: Should I sell all my crypto during a Market Downturn? Financial advice should always be tailored to individual circumstances. However, generally, panic selling during a Market Downturn can lead to significant losses. Many experts recommend sticking to a long-term strategy, dollar-cost averaging, and rebalancing your portfolio rather than liquidating all assets. Q5: How long do Market Downturns typically last? The duration of a Market Downturn can vary significantly. Some are short-lived corrections lasting weeks or months, while others can evolve into prolonged bear markets lasting a year or more. The recovery period also depends on the underlying economic conditions and investor sentiment.

The SEC, in an official statement released today, stated that previously approved spot crypto ETPs only allowed cash-based redemptions, creating serious drawbacks. Under this model, authorized participants could only redeem ETP shares in US dollars, forcing issuers to buy and sell crypto assets on the market. The SEC noted that this increased transaction costs, created price slippage, and made ETPs more expensive for investors. Related News: Giant Investment Company Cornered: Heavy Losses on Bitcoin and 4 Altcoins from Shorts - Here Are Its Positions With the new ruling, crypto ETPs will now be able to create and redeem crypto assets directly, just like traditional commodity ETPs. This will make transaction processes both more transparent and less costly. The SEC stated that this regulation is an important step for investor protection, market efficiency, and fair competition. The statement thanked SEC Chairman Paul S. Atkins, Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, and the Crypto Task Force for their leadership, and stated that the decision was a long-awaited development in the crypto asset market. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-29T20:25:10,"MicroStrategy Bitcoin: A Bold $2.52 Billion Acquisition Reshapes Corporate Crypto Strategy","BitcoinWorld MicroStrategy Bitcoin: A Bold $2.52 Billion Acquisition Reshapes Corporate Crypto Strategy In a move that has once again sent ripples through the cryptocurrency world, MicroStrategy, under its ticker $MSTR, has announced a monumental stride in its digital asset strategy. Following the successful closure of a substantial $2.52 billion STRC IPO, the enterprise software giant wasted no time in reaffirming its unwavering commitment to Bitcoin, utilizing a significant portion of the proceeds to bolster its already formidable holdings. This latest acquisition, a staggering 21,021 BTC at an average price of $117,256 per coin, further solidifies MicroStrategy‚Äôs position as a leading corporate proponent of the world‚Äôs premier cryptocurrency. This bold financial maneuver not only underscores the company‚Äôs long-term conviction in the digital asset but also sets a powerful precedent for other corporations considering the integration of Bitcoin into their treasury reserves. The question on everyone‚Äôs mind is: what drives this relentless pursuit of MicroStrategy Bitcoin , and what does it mean for the broader market? What‚Äôs Behind MicroStrategy‚Äôs Latest Bitcoin Bet? MicroStrategy‚Äôs journey into Bitcoin began in August 2020, spearheaded by its then-CEO, Michael Saylor. What started as an initial investment to hedge against inflation and diversify corporate assets has evolved into a core business strategy. The company views Bitcoin as a superior store of value, a digital gold that can protect its balance sheet from currency debasement and provide long-term capital appreciation. This recent acquisition is a testament to that enduring philosophy. Strategic Financing: The $2.52 billion STRC IPO (likely referring to a stock offering or convertible notes, though the prompt specifies ‚ÄòSTRC IPO‚Äô) provided the necessary capital for this significant purchase. MicroStrategy has consistently demonstrated innovative financing methods, including convertible senior notes and stock offerings, to fund its Bitcoin accumulation. Unwavering Conviction: Despite market volatility and occasional skepticism, MicroStrategy‚Äôs leadership has maintained a steadfast belief in Bitcoin‚Äôs future. They see short-term price fluctuations as opportunities to accumulate more, rather than reasons to divest. Pioneering Role: By making such large, public investments, MicroStrategy has become a pioneer in corporate Bitcoin adoption. Its actions are closely watched by other companies and institutional investors, often serving as a bellwether for broader corporate interest in digital assets. This aggressive accumulation strategy is not merely about holding a digital asset; it‚Äôs about making a profound statement on the future of finance and the role of decentralized currencies in a global economy. The latest purchase further cements MicroStrategy‚Äôs identity as a ‚ÄòBitcoin development company‚Äô that also provides enterprise software. A Deep Dive into MicroStrategy‚Äôs Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy MicroStrategy‚Äôs approach to accumulating Bitcoin is meticulous and often opportunistic. They leverage various financial instruments to raise capital, which is then swiftly deployed into BTC. This strategy allows them to capitalize on market dips and continuously expand their holdings, positioning themselves for long-term growth alongside Bitcoin‚Äôs adoption. Here‚Äôs a closer look at their strategic pillars: Consistent Capital Raises: MicroStrategy frequently taps into capital markets through offerings of convertible senior notes or common stock to fund its Bitcoin purchases. This allows them to acquire substantial amounts of BTC without significantly impacting their core software business‚Äôs operational cash flow. Dollar-Cost Averaging at Scale: While individual purchases might be large, over time, MicroStrategy‚Äôs consistent buying effectively acts as a form of dollar-cost averaging, reducing the impact of short-term price volatility on their overall average cost basis. The latest acquisition of 21,021 BTC at an average price of $117,256 showcases their willingness to invest significant capital even at higher price points, signaling strong conviction. Transparency and Public Commitment: Unlike many private funds or individual investors, MicroStrategy is transparent about its Bitcoin holdings and acquisition strategy. This transparency builds trust with its investors and the wider crypto community, reinforcing its thought leadership in the space. This unique blend of financial engineering and strategic foresight has allowed MicroStrategy to amass a truly impressive treasury of MicroStrategy Bitcoin , making it one of the largest corporate holders globally. Their strategy demonstrates a proactive approach to managing corporate assets in an evolving economic landscape. Impact of MicroStrategy‚Äôs Bitcoin Holdings on the Market The sheer scale of MicroStrategy‚Äôs Bitcoin holdings means their actions have a noticeable impact on the broader crypto market. When MicroStrategy announces a new acquisition, it often sends a bullish signal, indicating strong institutional demand and confidence in Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term prospects. Consider the following effects: Market Sentiment Boost: Each major purchase by MicroStrategy often leads to positive sentiment among investors, especially retail, who see it as validation from a publicly traded company. It reinforces the narrative of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Supply Shock Dynamics: By taking large amounts of Bitcoin off the open market and holding them in cold storage, MicroStrategy contributes to a reduction in liquid supply. In a market where demand is growing, this can put upward pressure on prices over time. Institutional Adoption Catalyst: MicroStrategy‚Äôs pioneering role encourages other corporations to explore Bitcoin as a treasury asset. Their success, or even their navigation of challenges, provides a roadmap and reduces perceived risks for newcomers. Increased Visibility: The company‚Äôs consistent presence in crypto news cycles keeps Bitcoin in the mainstream conversation, attracting new investors and increasing overall awareness. While MicroStrategy‚Äôs purchases don‚Äôt single-handedly dictate Bitcoin‚Äôs price, they certainly act as a significant and consistent demand driver, underpinning the market with substantial institutional capital. The ongoing accumulation of MicroStrategy Bitcoin is a powerful indicator of the asset‚Äôs maturation. The Road Ahead: What MicroStrategy‚Äôs Bitcoin Play Means for Corporate Treasury MicroStrategy‚Äôs audacious bet on Bitcoin serves as a compelling case study for corporate treasury management in the 21st century. It challenges traditional notions of cash management and asset diversification, prompting boards and CFOs worldwide to re-evaluate their strategies in an era of unprecedented monetary expansion and digital transformation. What can we learn, and what does the future hold? Rethinking Treasury Management: Companies are increasingly looking beyond traditional low-yield assets for their treasury reserves. MicroStrategy demonstrates that a portion of corporate assets can be allocated to alternative, potentially high-growth assets like Bitcoin, provided the company has a high-risk tolerance and a long-term outlook. Navigating Volatility: The primary challenge for any corporate Bitcoin holder is managing volatility. MicroStrategy‚Äôs strategy relies on a ‚Äòhodl‚Äô mentality, viewing Bitcoin as a long-term strategic asset rather than a trading instrument. This requires strong conviction and the ability to weather market downturns. Regulatory Landscape: The evolving regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies remains a key consideration. Companies like MicroStrategy are operating at the forefront, and their experiences will undoubtedly influence future regulations and corporate best practices. Shareholder Alignment: For publicly traded companies, aligning shareholder expectations with a Bitcoin-centric strategy is crucial. MicroStrategy has largely succeeded in this by educating its investor base and demonstrating the long-term value proposition. The continuous expansion of MicroStrategy Bitcoin holdings signals a future where digital assets could play a more prominent role in corporate balance sheets globally. This bold strategy positions MicroStrategy not just as a software company, but as a vanguard in the institutional adoption of decentralized finance. Conclusion: MicroStrategy‚Äôs Unwavering Bitcoin Conviction Continues to Shape the Future MicroStrategy‚Äôs latest $2.52 billion IPO and subsequent purchase of 21,021 BTC at an average price of $117,256 is more than just a financial transaction; it‚Äôs a powerful declaration of enduring belief in Bitcoin‚Äôs transformative potential. Under Michael Saylor‚Äôs visionary leadership, the company has consistently demonstrated that a strategic, long-term approach to digital assets can yield significant results and reshape corporate financial policy. This bold move reinforces MicroStrategy‚Äôs role as a trailblazer, inspiring further institutional exploration and adoption of cryptocurrencies. As the global financial landscape continues to evolve, MicroStrategy‚Äôs unwavering commitment to accumulating Bitcoin serves as a compelling case study for resilience, foresight, and a profound understanding of emerging economic paradigms. Their actions continue to push the boundaries of corporate treasury management, proving that innovation and conviction can lead to unprecedented growth in the digital age. The future of corporate crypto adoption looks increasingly bright, with MicroStrategy leading the charge. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is MicroStrategy‚Äôs primary business? A1: MicroStrategy is primarily an enterprise software company that provides business intelligence, mobile software, and cloud-based services. However, under Michael Saylor, it has also become widely known for its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy. Q2: Why does MicroStrategy invest so heavily in Bitcoin?

This allows them to raise significant capital specifically for Bitcoin purchases without impacting their core business operations. Q4: What impact does MicroStrategy‚Äôs Bitcoin strategy have on the crypto market?

2025-07-29T20:25:00,"Solana price prediction 2025-2031: Trends and insights for investors","Key takeaways Solana‚Äôs price can reach a maximum of $323.40 and an average trading value of $291.75 in 2025. By 2028, SOL is expected to reach a new high of $666.41, driven by mainstream adoption of its dApps. Solana‚Äôs price could surpass the $1,000 mark, potentially reaching $1,543.45 or higher by 2031. Despite occasional challenges for Solana ecosystem, including network congestion and competition from other blockchain platforms, the current sentiment shows that Solana demonstrates resilience and adaptability, despite the current price fluctuations, positioning itself as a leading player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 landscape. Overall, the prevailing sentiment within the Solana community reflects the current sentiment of confidence and excitement among investors , driven by the growing interest in Solana with stakeholders eagerly anticipating the platform‚Äôs continued evolution and impact on the broader crypto ecosystem. While uncertainties persist, Solana‚Äôs innovative approach and robust infrastructure instill optimism for its future price trajectory, as indicated by the technical analysis, solana price forecast and market dominance, particularly when evaluated against momentum indicators. How high can SOL go in 2025 and beyond? Overview Cryptocurrency Solana Token SOL Price $181.34 (-3%) Market Cap $97.57 Billion Trading Volume 24-hour $6.23 Billion Circulating Supply 538.31 Million SOL All-time High $294.33 Jan 19, 2025 All-time Low $0.5052, May 11, 2020 24-hour High $186.49 24-hour Low $178.57 Solana price prediction: Technical analysis Sentiment Bullish 50-Day SMA $159.26 200-Day SMA $163.01 Price Prediction $395.37¬†(118.42%) F & G Index 41.54¬†(fear) Green Days 17/30 (57%) 14-Day RSI 67.79 Solana price analysis: SOL faces bearish pressure toward $175 TL;DR Breakdown: Solana price analysis shows bearish pressure toward $175 Resistance for SOL is at $200 Support for SOL/USD is at $180 The price analysis of Solana for July 29 shows that SOL faced resistance at $190 that triggered a decline toward $175. Solana price analysis 1-day chart: SOL declines toward $180 Solana faced minor buying demand as it aimed to move above $190. However, current technical suggests a trend correction that pushed the price below $185. Currently, the price is holding momentum around $180, as the bears seek a breakdown towards the $170 level. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 54.80, showing that the retracement has put the trend back in the healthy zone but shows room for further volatility across the daily charts. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line declines rapidly, suggesting rising selling pressure. Additionally, the MACD candles show rising bearish momentum in the market. SOL/USD 4-hour price chart: Bearish momentum continues to challenge buyers The 4-hour chart for Solana revealed a steady rise as the bulls aimed to hold above the $190 price level. However, the recent rejection plunged the SOL price toward $180 support line. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview From a technical perspective, the MACD shows rising bearish momentum at -0.85, with the indicator showing rising buying demand with recent candles. This suggests that SOL is yet to find a support at the $180 level. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) dropped to 39.01, indicating that Solana still has room for further movement in the downward direction across the short term and SOL needs to defend the $180 level to prevent a breakdown towards $170.

SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The Solana price analysis across the daily and 1-hour chart indicates minor resistance around $190. The chart suggests a correction before the bulls can continue upwards. As the price falls back towards $185, SOL can be expected to hold at $180, a key level that has been defended previously. However, if the price falls below the $175 level, SOL may fall to the $168 mark. Is SOL a good investment? Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform known for its scalability and speed, boasting a substantial Total Value Locked ( TVL ). The network continues to hit key development milestones. Despite a challenging month, price predictions indicate a more positive outlook, suggesting the potential for future growth. Why is SOL down? As bulls failed to push the SOL price above $190 resistance, it triggered a decline toward the low of $175 level. Currently, price holds above $180 but the mounting bearish pressure might make that consolidation short-lived. What is Solana going to be worth in 2025? The Solana (SOL) price prediction for 2025 suggests a minimum value of $150.06 with an average price of $331.81. The price could reach a maximum of $367.80 during the year. Will SOL reach $1,000? The price forecasts indicate that SOL could reach the $1000 mark by 2030. Given the bullish scenario and the projected positive market sentiment and growth trend, SOL might reach $1,000 within the next five years. Can Solana reach $5,000? Reaching $5,000 is plausible but would likely take several years beyond the current forecast period. However, a snowball in the asset‚Äôs adoption might bring the moment sooner. Does SOL have a good long-term future? Yes, Solana has a good long-term future, with a promising market capitalization and exciting potential roi due to its high scalability, low transaction costs, robust ecosystem, and increasing institutional interest.

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth¬†with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana‚Äôs (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-price-prediction/,"SOL|TRADING|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET","Crypto Price Predictions|Solana",cryptocompare

2025-07-29T20:10:00,"Profit Taking Continues To Weigh On Cryptocurrencies","Summary Bitcoin and Ethereum are still consolidating around their relative peaks, underscoring the resilience of the market‚Äôs bellwethers. Ethereum's price action is currently consolidating in a triangle formation after hitting some new intermediate highs at $3,944. The selloff ongoing in Solana represents well the rest of the altcoins - a very strong run but also a strong reversal. By Elior Manier After the beginning of last week's big push in altcoins, cryptocurrencies are seeing some kind of retraction from their recent highs. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), however, are still consolidating around their relative peaks, underscoring the resilience of the market‚Äôs bellwethers. Profit-taking has rippled across smaller tokens, with mid‚Äëcap altcoins sliding 5‚Äì10 % as traders lock in gains after their consequent past week rallies. Bitcoin is whipsawing in a tight $115,000‚Äì$120,000 band, while Ethereum hovers just below the $3,800 mark, digesting its latest red-hot rally. Meanwhile, heavyweights like Cardano ( ADA-USD ) and Solana ( SOL-USD ) have given back their gains a bit more sharply, pressured by rotation into stablecoins and some sell-the-news on the US deals ahead of key economic events. Despite the pullback, liquidity remains robust, and open interest across futures markets holds near record levels. The challenge is now to see if sentiment from the broader market news influences the demand for cryptocurrencies more positively or negatively. In the meantime, let‚Äôs look at technicals for the three most popular cryptos : ETH, BTC and SOL. This article is a follow-up on the cryptocurrency article released Friday. Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana 4H Charts Bitcoin 4H Chart Bitcoin 4H Chart, July 29, 2025 ‚Äì Source: TradingView Bitcoin is still consolidating in a triangle formation, but its 4H 50-period MA has just passed above the price action and is now becoming resistance. The weekly open wasn't as strong compared to the Ethereum, showing that despite consolidating at its highs, Bitcoin is trading on a less intense relative strength to the Ether than it was in the beginning of 2025. RSI momentum is also turning slightly bearish on short-timeframes, but do not forget that the Bitcoin is trading very near its all-time highs. Track the reactions between $110,000 to $115,000 ‚Äì A weekly close below that region would be giving more hand to the bears. Keep ETH/BTC in check to get a better view of the appetite for altcoins Support Levels: $115,000 Pivot Zone (+/- $600) Previous ATH Support $110,000 to $112,000 $100,000 Major Support Resistance Levels: 4H MA 50 at $118,269 $120,000 Resistance (+/- $300) Current ATH resistance $121,000 to $123,000 Potential Resistance between $126,500 and $128,200 (Fib Extensions) Ethereum 4H Chart ETH 4H Chart, July 29, 2025 ‚Äì Source: TradingView Ethereum's price action is currently consolidating in a triangle formation after hitting some new intermediate highs at $3,944. The action is still slightly tilted upwards, and staying above the immediate pivot zone, which would be more bullish than bearish. However, a general look at the market would be needed to confirm this hypothesis: Altcoins are currently getting sold off. Markets are linked, so any rally in the Ether here should pull upwards sentiment. Look at the 4H 50-period MA which just caught up to the price action for immediate relative strength indications. Keep in check any breakout to the upside or downside from here to get a more general view from the market. Support Levels: Immediate Pivot Between $3,700 to $3,750 4H MA 50 $3,700 $3,500 support zone Resistance Levels: $3,880 to $3,940 resistance zone $3,944 intermediate highs $4,090 December 2024 highs $4,870 all-time highs Solana 4H Chart SOL 4H Chart, July 29, 2025 ‚Äì Source: TradingView The selloff ongoing in Solana represents well the rest of the altcoins‚Äîa very strong run but also a strong reversal. The bulls will have to be careful of how they play it to maintain the bullish structure. The 4H RSI is now in bear territory but isn't sloping downwards, usually a sign of lack of seller strength and a sign of consolidation. Watch the $175 intermediate lows from the end of last week to spot imminent momentum. Staying above holds the intermediate bullish outlook, while passing below will give some hands to the bears. Support Levels: $175 intermediate lows $150 previous pivot turned support Support 2 $140 to $145 Resistance Levels: $200 to $205 $185 Momentum Pivot and 4H MA 50 Resistance 2: 225 to 232 Resistance 3: 255 to 265 All-time Highs: $295 Safe Trades!

Reacting to this development, X Finance Bull issued a strong warning to the XRP community on X, stating: ‚ÄúThe next 48 hours are not normal.‚Äù He claimed that the upcoming report could confirm XRP‚Äôs involvement in U.S. strategic reserves, not as a threat, but as a tool. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll look back at this moment and wish you loaded more $XRP,‚Äù he added. $XRP holders, the next 48 hours are not normal The U.S. is about to drop a crypto report that could confirm strategic reserves and XRP is front and center.

You‚Äôll look back at this moment and wish you loaded more $XRP pic.twitter.com/ltIzfhvOve ‚Äî X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) July 29, 2025 The Presidential Working Group The working group was formed under Executive Order 14178, signed by President Trump on January 23, 2025. The mandate was to develop a clear framework for digital assets in the U.S., including token classification, investor protections, stablecoin rules, and digital asset infrastructure. The group was also directed to explore the establishment of government-held reserves using seized cryptocurrency assets. The 180-day deadline concludes with the expected release of the final report on July 30. Strategic Reserves and XRP‚Äôs Possible Role On March 6, the administration issued another executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, along with a broader U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile. The initiative uses assets seized from criminal enforcement actions, and includes leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and XRP. This development sparked widespread speculation about the government‚Äôs long-term crypto strategy. Significantly, XRP was one of the few tokens explicitly named in the documents outlining the reserve program, adding weight to X Finance Bull‚Äôs assertions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Regulatory Clarity and Legislative Progress The release of the report also comes shortly after the signing of the GENIUS Act on July 18 , 2025, a landmark law that regulates stablecoins, mandates audits, and strengthens federal oversight. These legislative efforts reflect a broader shift in the U.S. government‚Äôs approach to digital assets: from fragmented and enforcement-driven to structured and proactive. The upcoming report is expected to align with these recent laws and clarify how strategic reserves, especially those containing XRP, will be managed going forward. Why the XRP Community Is Watching Closely X Finance Bull‚Äôs warning reflects the growing anticipation that XRP might not only be acknowledged but actively positioned as a national strategic asset. Earlier this year, XRP saw a 32% surge after it was confirmed as part of the U.S. reserve program. A formal policy endorsement in the July 30 report could trigger another wave of bullish sentiment. With the report‚Äôs release imminent, the next 48 hours mark a potential turning point for XRP. While nothing is guaranteed until the document is made public, X Finance Bull‚Äôs message underscores the magnitude of what‚Äôs at stake. If XRP is indeed confirmed as a cornerstone of U.S. digital asset strategy, its value, both in the market and in policy, could rise significantly.

2025-07-29T20:00:31,"XRP Dormant Coins On The Move: Reason Behind Price Plunge?","On-chain data shows old XRP tokens have been moving back into circulation recently, a potential sign that long-term holders have been taking profits. XRP Mean Dollar Invested Age Has Seen A Drop Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the XRP network has seen signs of movement from veteran hands. Two key metrics highlight this trend: Mean Dollar Invested Age and Age Consumed. The first of these, the Mean Dollar Invested Age, keeps track of the average age (in days) of every dollar invested into the cryptocurrency. The ‚Äòage‚Äô of a coin or the USD value invested in it is tracked from the point of the coin‚Äôs last transaction. Related Reading: Ethereum Exchange Reserve Plummets: Over 1 Million ETH Withdrawn For example, if a coin remains dormant for 10 days, it accumulates 10 coin days. If the price at the time of its last movement was $2, then it‚Äôs carrying 20 coin-dollar days. The Mean Dollar Invested Age per dollar in this case is, therefore, 10 coin-dollar days. Now, what happens when a coin that has been dormant for some period is finally moved? Both the coin days and coin-dollar days associated to it reset back to zero. In other words, its age is ‚Äòconsumed.‚Äô The second indicator of relevance here, the Age Consumed, keeps track of the coin days being destroyed in this manner across the network every day. Below is a chart that shows how the Mean Dollar Invested Age and Age Consumed have changed for XRP over the past year. As is visible in the graph, the XRP Mean Dollar Invested Age has witnessed a decline during the last few weeks, indicating that the average dollar invested into the asset is becoming younger. The indicator‚Äôs value has now come down to 593 days, which is 91 days lower compared to one month ago. The Age Consumed has seen some notable spikes alongside this decline, which means that long-term holders have been making moves. The long-term holders refer to the HODLers of the market, who hold for long periods with strong conviction and, in the process, amass a large number of coin days. When these diamond hands finally make moves, the Age Consumed tends to register spikes as large-scale coin days destruction accompanies them. From the chart, it‚Äôs apparent that most of the recent large spikes came just as XRP hit its price top. This could be a potential sign that the long-term holders were cashing in on the rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Remains Flat‚ÄîAnd The SSR Ratio Might Explain Why Since then, the cryptocurrency has plunged. It now remains to be seen whether the Age Consumed would continue to spike in the near future or if the HODLers are done for now. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $3.15, down more than 10% in the last week.

Goldman and BNY recently announced a joint venture to launch tokenized money market fund services using a blockchain developed by Goldman. BlackRock, BNY Investments Dreyfus, Federated Hermes, Fidelity Investments and Goldman Sachs Asset Management all plan to participate in the launch of the new service. Teresa Ho, a managing director at JPMorgan, tells Bloomberg the partnership could expand the use cases for money market funds. ‚ÄúThe true takeaway from this is beyond the typical way we see money funds being used as a cash management asset class ‚Äî they can now use it as collateral. Instead of posting cash, or posting Treasuries, you can post money-market shares and not lose interest along the way. It speaks to the versatility of money funds.‚Äù Ho also notes that numerous other financial firms see the potential benefit of tokenization amid blossoming regulatory clarity. ‚ÄúThis is true across banks, asset managers, and payment processors. We wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to continue to see more developments with respect to stablecoins being more integrated with the traditional financial system, as well as more tokenization of real-world assets.‚Äù Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
