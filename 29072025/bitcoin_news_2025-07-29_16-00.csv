2025-07-29T13:58:14,"Crypto Lender Abra Secretly Pauses Withdrawals, Customers Fear $700M Platform Collapse","Crypto lender Abra has quietly paused withdrawals for international customers without public announcement, sparking fears of another major platform collapse similar to Celsius and BlockFi as desperate users flood social media demanding access to their frozen funds. According to DLNew , the platform, which claims to manage over $700 million in customer assets, notified some users via email on July 19 that “ Abra Earn international services are currently paused, effective immediately ” due to “ broader risk management efforts ” and “ external circumstances outside of our control. “ Silent Crisis Unfolds as CEO Continues Public Promotion Customers report being unable to withdraw funds for several weeks, with support representatives cutting them off and ignoring requests for explanations. Users have taken to social media platforms to plead directly with CEO Bill Barhydt, who continues promoting the company while avoiding customer inquiries. Source: Comments under Barhydt’s X post The crisis emerged just over a year after Abra reached settlements with 25 US states requiring $82 million in customer refunds for operating without proper licenses. The platform previously faced insolvency allegations from Texas regulators in 2023, who claimed Abra had been insolvent since March 2023. Customer reports of missed payments and withdrawal issues began appearing online in early June, with affected users describing zero yields on accounts that previously generated returns. Source: Comments under the company’s X post The situation recalls the collapse of major crypto lenders, including Celsius and BlockFi , in 2022. Speculatively, Abra appears to offer high yields through unsecured lending and DeFi activities. The platform recently launched new services targeting institutional clients and high-net-worth individuals, but it is facing mounting customer service failures. Pattern of Regulatory Violations and Financial Distress Abra’s current crisis follows years of regulatory violations and financial difficulties across multiple jurisdictions. In June 2023, the Texas State Securities Board accused the platform of securities fraud , alleging Abra misled investors while operating in a state of insolvency or near-insolvency. Texas regulators claimed Abra secretly transferred over $118 million in digital assets to Binance while concealing financial information about loan defaults and asset transfers. The board alleged Abra held $30 million in failed lender Babel Finance, $30 million in Genesis, and $10 million in collapsed Three Arrows Capital. The platform reached a $82.1 million settlement with 25 US states in June 2024 for operating without required money transmission licenses. Under the agreement, CEO Bill Barhydt was personally barred from involvement in money transmission services within those states for five years. The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority warned in November 2023 that Abra was not authorized to offer services in the country and advised against dealing with the firm. Georgia’s Banking and Finance Department ordered Barhydt to be personally liable for returning funds to US customers. The SEC settled charges against Abra in August 2024 for improperly marketing Abra Earn as an unregistered security. At its peak, Abra Earn managed approximately $600 million in assets, with nearly $500 million from US investors before the program was phased out. Multiple state investigations revealed Abra offered crypto transactions through its mobile app without the necessary licenses, leading to the forced cessation of US operations and customer fund returns. International Customers Left Without Recourse as Platform Struggles The current withdrawal pause appears to affect only international customers, with unclear reasons for the geographic limitation. Alan, a customer from Guatemala, reported through DLNews being unable to access $1,200 deposited on the platform after noticing zero yields on previously interest-bearing accounts. Customer service responses have become increasingly generic, with official Abra accounts providing stock responses offering little guidance or help. Recent Trustpilot reviews describe representatives cutting off communications and ignoring fund access requests entirely. CEO Barhydt continues to appear on podcasts and post multiple times daily on social media, while customers plead for responses in the comment sections. The disconnect between promotional activities and customer service failures has intensified user frustration and concern. The platform’s claimed $700 million in managed assets represents significant customer exposure if withdrawal restrictions persist or expand. Unlike previous crypto lender collapses that affected primarily US customers, international users may have limited regulatory recourse. In mid-2024, Abra launched Abra Prime and Abra Private platforms for institutional and high-net-worth clients while simultaneously struggling to serve existing retail customers. The platform also introduced Abra Treasury for corporate Bitcoin reserve management despite ongoing operational difficulties. As it stands now, neither Abra nor CEO Bill Barhydt has provided public statements addressing the withdrawal pause or customer concerns.

2025-07-29T13:57:34,"Corporate Ethereum Treasuries Could Hit 10% of Supply, Says Standard Chartered","The post Corporate Ethereum Treasuries Could Hit 10% of Supply, Says Standard Chartered appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum is entering a new phase of institutional adoption. From treasury strategies to bullish price targets, it is getting serious attention from corporate and financial players. As per a recent report from Standard Chartered, institutional treasuries now hold around 1% of ETH’s total circulating supply. But that’s just the beginning. The bank believes that this could grow tenfold, with businesses eventually holding up to 10% of ETH’s total supply. Ethereum Gains Edge Over Bitcoin Corporate ETH buying and spot Ether ETF inflows are both on the rise. According to data from Sosovalue , the cumulative total net inflow for spot ether ETFs has reached $9.40 billion. $ETH ETF inflow + $65,200,000 yesterday. Blackrock bought $130,200,000 Ethereum. pic.twitter.com/EIzLYMHvbG — Ted (@TedPillows) July 29, 2025 The rise in interest has likely played a big role in ETH outperforming Bitcoin recently. The ETH/BTC ratio has jumped from 0.018 in April to 0.032 in July. Geoff Kendrick, analyst at Standard Chartered, notes that this could spark the start of a bigger shift, where institutions begin favoring Ethereum more heavily in their digital asset portfolios, even over Bitcoin. Is ETH More Attractive Than BTC? Ethereum is emerging as a more useful treasury asset than Bitcoin. While Bitcoin is often held for its scarcity, Ethereum offers the added benefits of staking rewards, currently around 3%, along with access to DeFi tools that can boost returns. In regions with strict crypto regulations, Ethereum also stands out. The report suggests that ETH can serve as a smart workaround for companies that want crypto exposure on their balance sheets but face regulatory limitations. That makes ETH a more flexible option for publicly listed firms. Staking Brings Rewards and Risks However, a Bernstein report highlights how Ethereum treasuries are taking a different approach than Bitcoin-focused ones. Instead of just holding ETH, companies are staking it to earn yield and boost earnings. But this strategy isn’t without risks. There are liquidity delays when unstaking, and tools like restaking or DeFi protocols introduce smart contract risks that traditional assets don’t face. Companies like BitMine, SharpLink, and Bit Digital have accumulated over 876,000 ETH in July, with BitMine alone crossing $2 billion in ETH and aiming for 5% the total supply. Bernstein sees Ethereum gaining long-term value from its growing ecosystem. Will Ethereum Cross $4,000? Analysts Debate Ethereum briefly crossed $3,900 on Monday, its highest since December 2024, before pulling back. It has surged over 50% in the past month. Standard Chartered has maintained its $4,000 target for Ethereum, while analysts expect it to break its previous all-time high of $4,800 this year. BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes even sees it hitting $10,000. Meanwhile, Tom Lee’s Bitmine projected an eye-popping $60,000 target. $ETH has broken out of its short-term consolidation phase. First time it happened, ETH pumped 25% in a week. 2nd time it happened, ETH pumped 30% in a week. If history repeat itself again, ETH will trade above $4,300 by end of this week. pic.twitter.com/Cc6TaJmgDd — ZYN (@Zynweb3) July 28, 2025 Chris Burniske pointed out that Ethereum went from the most hated coin to the favorite in just about five weeks. As promised, here’s the updated $ETH outlook. Two paths ahead: • Conservative target: $8K+ • Optimistic: $13K+ and beyond In both scenarios, expect a sharp 20–25% washout after ATHs, the final shakeout before liftoff. Q4 is when it ignites. This is the roadmap. pic.twitter.com/bI48uCQuhT — Wolf (@IamCryptoWolf) July 25, 2025 Crypto analyst Wolf predicts that in a conservative scenario, ETH could reach over $8,000, while the more optimistic view targets above $13,000. Wolf also warned that after Ethereum hits a new all-time high, a typical market correction of 20-25% is likely before the next rally begins. Ethereum is quickly becoming more than a digital asset and is now a long-term strategic play. The token is currently trading at $3,853, down 0.7% in the last 24 hours.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/corporate-ethereum-treasuries-could-hit-10-of-supply-says-standard-chartered/,"ETH|BTC|TRADING|REGULATION|TREASURY","News|Crypto news|Ethereum",cryptocompare

D2X offers seven-day trading for BTC and ETH futures. The capital injection will fuel product development and support onboarding for institutional clients seeking a regulated path into crypto derivatives trading, according to a report from Silicon Canals . “With its MTF license and weekend-ready architecture, D2X addresses two major gaps in Europe: regulated venues and access to 24/7 crypto markets,” said Charlie Sandor, Investment Partner at CMT Digital. “We’re proud to support a team that’s setting a new benchmark for institutional crypto trading.” D2X Secures Follow-On Support from Point72, Tioga, GSR, and Fortino The round also drew participation from existing investors including Point72 Ventures, Tioga Capital, GSR, and Fortino Capital. It follows D2X’s €9.1 million Series A funding raised in 2023, which coincided with the exchange becoming the first in the EU to receive a MiFID-compliant Multilateral Trading Facility (MTF) license for crypto derivatives, granted by the Dutch Authority for Financial Markets (AFM). Founded by Theodore Rozencwajg, Don van der Krogt, and Laetitia Grimaud, D2X is focused exclusively on institutional-grade crypto derivatives. The company’s product lineup currently includes USD- and EUR-denominated Bitcoin and Ethereum futures, with options trading expected to launch shortly. Its infrastructure supports seven-day trading while remaining fully compliant with MiFID II regulations, a model designed to mirror the around-the-clock nature of crypto markets while offering the safeguards traditional financial institutions expect.

Coinbase Launches Regulated Perpetual Futures for US Retail Traders Last week, Coinbase introduced CFTC-regulated nano Bitcoin and Ethereum perpetual futures , giving US retail traders access to up to 10x leverage within a compliant onshore framework. Offered through Coinbase Financial Markets, the contracts come with low taker fees starting at 0.02% and replicate traditional perps, featuring five-year expirations and hourly funding rates. Settled in USD, the new products trade 24/7 and aim to bring U.S. users back from offshore platforms. Perpetual futures dominate global crypto derivatives trading, but American traders have long been pushed to riskier offshore venues due to regulatory hurdles. Coinbase’s launch marks a shift, providing legal access to leverage while aligning with Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) standards. The move is part of a broader trend as US exchanges , including Kraken, ramp up their regulated derivatives offerings.

2025-07-29T13:51:52,"Algeria riases threat of fines and prison time in blanket ban of crypto operations","Authorities in Algeria are digging in their heels in their push to prohibit almost any activity related to cryptocurrencies with new legislation targeting specific transactions. An update of the Algerian law on combating money laundering introduces harsh punishment for various operations with digital assets, including monetary penalties and prison terms. Algeria turns back on Bitcoin, closing all doors for cryptos Recent legislative amendments, an attempt to eradicate rather than regulate crypto, have been described as a “thunderbolt hitting cryptocurrencies in Algeria” by the local Algerie360 portal which, detailing the changes, concluded: “In a decision without appeal, the country turns its back permanently on any form of use, creation or exchange of virtual currencies.” The news outlet referred to a bill revising Algeria’s anti-money laundering (AML) rules. The updated legislation, which went into effect with its publication in the North African nation’s Official Journal on July 24, is quite repressive against digital assets and their users. It adds “radical” provisions concerning specific operations with cryptocurrencies that amount to a zero-tolerance policy regarding a list of crypto-related activities and transactions, the report warned. In its latest version, the law completely bans the “issuance of virtual assets of all kinds; their purchase, sale or possession; their use as a means of payment or investment; their promotion or advertising in any form.” Under its new Article 6, the establishment and operation of platforms providing exchange or wallet services for cryptocurrencies have been prohibited as well. In essence, this means that merely holding decentralized digital money like Bitcoin or even fiat-pegged stablecoins like those issued by Tether can now be interpreted as a crime in the country, the publication highlighted, elaborating: “Behind this reform, the authorities intend to close the door to a universe perceived as opaque, unstable and out of control at a time when unregulated uses of cryptocurrencies are multiplying on a global scale.” Algerians risk fines and jail if they do anything with cryptocurrencies The Algerian government has been consistent in its hostile attitude towards cryptocurrencies. Its Financial Law from 2018 banned their use until at least 2025. But amid high inflation and strict state controls on capital flows, many citizens of the Arab country continued to engage in crypto transactions, often of a peer-to-peer nature or involving foreign platforms. The authorities in Algiers have also refused to legally recognize Bitcoin and the like to any extent, despite their popularity, leaving many Algerians vulnerable to prosecution and without any protection as consumers and investors. While the financial act from a few years ago did list some crypto activities, including the purchase, sale and possession of “virtual currency,” it wasn’t nearly as specific as the new texts in the AML law. The same applies to penalties for breaking the rules. According to Article 31a, offenders may be fined between 200,000 and 1 million Algerian dinars (almost $7,700), receive a prison sentence of up to 1 year, or get both, depending on the severity of their crime. The sanctions are obviously tailored to dissuade any potential use of cryptocurrencies within the government’s broader attempt to increase state control over the national financial system while consolidating Algeria ’s financial market. Other countries with restrictive crypto policies in the region include Egypt , its largest economy, where the central bank has issued repeated warnings about cryptocurrencies but, nevertheless, allowed some platforms to continue to operate. Neighboring Morocco banned digital asset transactions in 2017, citing concerns over financial crimes and potential negative effects on economic stability. However, its monetary authority has since recognized the wide spread of the digital assets and drafted a law to regulate them.

2025-07-29T13:39:17,"Ethereum Price Analysis: How Close Is ETH to Breaking Above $4K?","Ethereum’s price is very close to making a new high in 2025, following Bitcoin’s recent record-breaking run. However, there are some signs of caution, as the market might be overheated, as momentum indicators suggest. Therefore, while the market structure is still bullish, this might not be a good time to buy ETH due to its riskiness. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart As the daily chart shows, ETH’s price has been rallying aggressively since its rebound from the $2,100 support level. It has since broken above both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages. These daily MAs, located around the $2,600 mark, have created a bullish crossover, further solidifying the bullish structure of the market. However, there are some reasons for concern. As evident, the RSI indicator has been in the overbought region for a while now, and is also demonstrating a clear bearish divergence with the price’s recent highs. In this case, a pullback to the $3,300 support zone could precede a potential breakout above the previous high around $4,107. The 4-Hour Chart Zooming in on the 4-hour chart, an interesting price action pattern is forming just below the key $4,000 resistance level. The ascending channel currently trapping the price inside is mostly a reversal pattern if broken to the downside. Therefore, the lower boundary of the channel, located around the $3,500 short-term support level, is now the most critical area the buyers should defend. On the other hand, a breakout above the pattern could initiate a significant rally, as it would go against technical expectations. Therefore, investors should watch out for a potentially explosive run if the channel gets broken to the upside, as it would mean that the recent consolidation was an accumulation phase, not a distribution by the smart money. On-Chain Analysis Ethereum Fund Holdings The latest data on Ethereum fund holdings shows a sharp and sustained increase, reaching over 5.3 million ETH, marking the highest level ever recorded. This metric reflects the total amount of ETH held by institutions through vehicles like ETFs, trusts, and crypto-focused funds. The rise suggests growing institutional confidence in Ethereum, likely fueled by its improving price structure, growing narrative around ETH ETFs, and the broader appetite for regulated, indirect exposure to crypto assets. Notably, this surge in holdings has closely followed Ethereum’s breakout above $3,000, reinforcing the idea that institutions are stepping in during periods of strength, not just weakness. The chart also shows how closely fund holdings align with price trends. When Ethereum sold off sharply earlier this year, fund holdings declined, but they began recovering aggressively alongside the price from May onward. This behavior indicates that institutions are becoming more active in responding to market momentum rather than just accumulating during downturns. If this trend continues, rising fund holdings could add a steady source of demand and act as a tailwind for Ethereum in the coming weeks, especially as more investors seek exposure through structured, regulated products rather than direct crypto purchases.

The post included a clear and data-driven claim that “The next 3 weeks in XRP could change your life.” The analyst encouraged the community not to give up. Backed by a chart from BlockchainCenter.net, the suggestion points to a possible transition from a Bitcoin-dominated market cycle to an upcoming altcoin season , one that could heavily benefit XRP.

Don’t give up now! pic.twitter.com/m2mpR0c92w — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) July 28, 2025 Analyzing the Altcoin Season Index The chart itself outlines the Altcoin Season Index, a metric that indicates whether the market is favoring Bitcoin or alternative cryptocurrencies. The index value currently sits just under 50, with 25 indicating a Bitcoin-dominated market and 75 signaling a full altcoin season. Over the past several months, XRP has experienced lows near the bottom of the index, appearing around major pivot points. The asset experienced a massive surge during the last cycle in late 2024. This culminated in a rally to $3.39 in January 2025, and XRP only recently beat that level when it rose to a new all-time high . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Recent Market Movement and Repeating Patterns As of late July 2025, the index shows a decisive breakout from previous consolidation levels. The shaded region ahead indicates a projection toward an altcoin season. The transition is particularly noteworthy given the past pattern with XRP showing strong price movement when the index swings from Bitcoin Season to Altcoin Season. This pattern also aligns with XRP’s performance in relation to Bitcoin dominance. Experts have shown that each time Bitcoin dominance falls, XRP enters a bullish phase . The flip to altcoin season could weaken Bitcoin’s dominance, clearing the path for an XRP surge. Steph’s chart highlights several previous peaks, representing moments of high liquidity and capital rotation into altcoins. These moments correlate with spikes in the index, each occurring after prior lows. Steph’s use of historical charting aligns with a broader sentiment that XRP and the broader altcoin market will soon explode. Veteran trader Peter Brandt recently confirmed that the market is entering another altcoin season . XRP may be on the verge of another massive bull run, and Steph expects something big to happen over the next 3 weeks.

2025-07-29T13:30:00,"Truth Social Bitcoin ETF Faces New SEC Delay","The proposed ETF is the first tied to a US president's business interests, which raised many ethical concerns among lawmakers about potential conflicts of interest. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Jeff Merkley even flagged past Trump-affiliated crypto deals as possible corruption risks. The SEC also postponed decisions on other crypto funds, including Grayscale’s Solana Trust and Canary Capital’s Litecoin ETF. SEC Slows Down Trump ETF Plan The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) postponed its decision on the Truth Social Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), which is backed by the Trump Media and Technology Group. This means the regulator extended the review deadline from Aug. 4 to Sept. 18. (Source: SEC ) The ETF seeks approval to list on NYSE Arca under the SEC’s commodity-based trust share rules, joining a growing roster of digital asset funds under review. The SEC explained that the extension is to allow more time for evaluation, a common move given the agency's statutory ability to take up to 270 days to make a final determination on ETF applications. The Truth Social Bitcoin ETF is unique for its ties to President Donald Trump, which makes it the first proposed crypto ETF connected to a sitting or former US president’s business interests. While no formal objections have been raised so far by the SEC, Trump’s increasing involvement in the crypto industry has caused some serious ethical concerns. In particular, Democrats questioned whether Trump could benefit personally from regulatory decisions affecting crypto markets or firms affiliated with his ventures. This concern is amplified by previous deals involving Trump-linked companies like World Liberty Financial, Binance, and a UAE firm, which were flagged by Senators Elizabeth Warren and Jeff Merkley as potential channels for foreign corruption and conflicts of interest. Markley and Warren questioning Trump’s crypto ties (Source: US Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs ) The SEC also delayed decisions on Grayscale’s Solana Trust and Canary Capital’s proposed Litecoin ETF, and extended their deadlines to Oct. 10. Commissioner Hester Peirce, who is very well known for her pro-crypto views, recently urged market participants to stay patient, due to ongoing litigation and internal complexities. Despite this, the pace of current ETF decisions is still quick when compared to historical norms. In fact, it took over a decade for the SEC to approve the first spot Bitcoin ETF in January of 2024. Trump has been highly active in crypto policy. On July 18, he signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing the first comprehensive US regulatory framework for stablecoins. Weeks earlier, on June 25, his appointee to the Federal Housing Finance Administration, William J.

2025-07-29T13:25:54,"Altcoin Momentum Builds as Market Fragility Rises: Bitfinex Alpha","Over the past few weeks, crypto investors have been rotating their capital from bitcoin (BTC) into altcoins. That trend has not stopped. In fact, the market is witnessing a growing risk appetite among traders. According to a weekly report by the crypto exchange Bitfinex, this trend is also evident in open interest ratios. Investors are deploying high leverage on volatile assets. As this dynamic of excessive speculation continues to build beneath the surface, the market structure becomes weaker and more vulnerable to liquidation cascades. Altcoin Momentum Builds Bitcoin remains structurally strong, but its open interest dominance is declining. This metric has fallen from 51% to 41% in three months, signaling a shift in trader positioning within the derivatives landscape. Within this period, Ethereum’s open interest dominance has risen from 17% to 26% and altcoins have seen their dominance remain stable in the low 30s. This growth reflects renewed interest in ether (ETH) amid improving narratives. This season is driven by capital rotation between different altcoins, speculative surges, and continuous listings on major exchanges. Traders are now looking beyond BTC to capture gains in ETH and trending cryptocurrencies. While this dynamic is favorable for the altcoin sector in the short term, it introduces greater systemic fragility, with fragmented capital across volatile assets. Analysts say this can amplify liquidation events, making the market vulnerable to sharp reversals and exaggerated volatility. “If momentum stalls or unexpected macro or regulatory news emerges, this leverage can unwind rapidly, potentially exacerbating downside moves across the altcoin complex,” Bitfinex analysts said, adding that risk management is increasingly important at this market phase. Market Becomes More Fragile Furthermore, the ratio of altcoin to BTC liquidations has increased. As BTC witnessed a sharp decline between July 23 and 25, the trend was magnified across altcoins. The market saw $1.46 billion in long liquidations, with BTC alone accounting for $370 million. Although the impact of this plunge was modest on BTC, leveraged traders took a significant hit. With $1.1 billion wiped out in long liquidations, Bitfinex says the market has become overcrowded on the long side. Meanwhile, the market is already highly sensitive to volatility, as seen in daily liquidations over the last 30 days. Analysts found that average daily liquidations have exceeded $350 million across both long and short positions in the last four weeks. This trend could become more aggressive as traders continue to utilize leverage across altcoins.

The company retains the biggest ETH treasury after it pivoted from BTC mining. BitMine Immersion Technologies, Inc. announced a $1B stock buyback plan to improve its ratio of crypto assets per share. The company’s board approved the open-ended repurchase program, with no strict schedule, allowing buybacks to be timed according to market conditions. Immediately after the stock buyback announcement, BitMine also added more ETH to its reserves. 🧵 1/ Bitmine is today announcing a $1 billion stock repurchase program. Per Tom Lee @fundstrat , Chairman of Bitmine: “In our road to achieving ‘the alchemy of 5%’ of ETH, there may be times when the best expected return of our capital is to acquire our own shares” ticker:… — Bitmine BMNR (@BitMNR) July 29, 2025 BitMine buys more ETH The company added another 58,224 ETH valued at $225M, extending the trend of aggressively accumulating ETH. In the past week alone, BitMine and SharpLink Gaming added around 140K ETH to their reserves, essentially absorbing all the newly minted supply from validators. BitMine has been extremely bullish on ETH, suggesting the token may rise as far as $60,000 if the bull market continues. Ethereum has grown its activity, mostly due to increased demand for stablecoin transfers. BitMine is one of the most ambitious and aggressive ETH buyers, aiming to control up to 5% of the token’s supply. So far, the company has accrued 566,776 ETH, with large-scale buying soon after pivoting from BTC accumulation. “ In our road to achieving ‘the alchemy of 5%’ of ETH, there may be times when the best expected return of our capital is to acquire our own shares,” said Thomas Lee, chairman of BitMine. The company has $401.4M in unencumbered cash, with $22.76 net asset value per share from a mix of cash and crypto. BitMine retains 154 BTC in its earlier treasury, with a total of $2.7B in crypto assets. Following the initial pivot to an ETH treasury, BMNR shares sank to a lower baseline. Currently, BMNR trades at a one-month low of $35.11, down from a local peak of $135.01 in early July. The stock’s volatility allows for repurchases at a lower range. The reserves of BitMine are insufficient to cover the entire buyback program. This may mean the company may sell some of its crypto assets, if the market conditions suggest holding ETH is less favorable. Unlike Strategy, BitMine may not hold at all costs, and trade ETH more actively, while tweaking the number of shares. As of July 28, the firm had 121,739,533 shares outstanding. The increased number of shares follows a new offering of equity for additional ETH purchases, filed with the US SEC as of July 28. SharpLink Gaming announces official treasury expansion BitMine’s main competitor, SharpLink Gaming, announced the official expansion of its treasury. On-chain data showed the inflow of ETH into connected wallets. SharpLink finally confirmed its treasury is now up to 438,190 ETH . The company started accumulating ETH in early June, raising its ETH per share by 70% since then. SBET shares currently trade at $20.92, again reverting to a higher baseline following the initial irrational spike. ETH treasury companies bought in during one of the biggest rallies for the year. Following July’s buying, ETH returned above $3,800. ETH treasuries are also shifting to staking or liquid staking to produce passive income for holders.

2025-07-29T13:25:10,"FalconX Brazil Unleashes Prime Crypto Brokerage in Latin America","BitcoinWorld FalconX Brazil Unleashes Prime Crypto Brokerage in Latin America The cryptocurrency landscape is constantly evolving, and nowhere is this more evident than in Latin America, a region rapidly emerging as a hotbed for digital asset innovation and adoption. At the forefront of this exciting development is FalconX Brazil , a major digital asset trading platform that has just announced its strategic expansion into the vibrant Brazilian market. This move isn’t just about a new market entry; it signifies a pivotal moment for institutional crypto demand across the entire Latin American continent. Why is FalconX Brazil Setting Its Sights on Latin America? Latin America, particularly Brazil, has demonstrated an insatiable appetite for digital assets. This isn’t just retail enthusiasm; institutional players, from banks to investment funds, are increasingly recognizing the transformative potential of cryptocurrencies. FalconX Brazil ‘s decision to launch services in this region is a direct response to this burgeoning demand, aiming to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning digital asset economy. The region’s unique economic conditions, including high inflation in some countries and a youthful, tech-savvy population, have fostered an environment ripe for crypto adoption. Digital assets offer an alternative for wealth preservation, cross-border remittances, and innovative financial products. FalconX, known for its robust prime brokerage services, is strategically positioned to cater to the sophisticated needs of institutional clients looking to navigate this complex yet promising market. This expansion also aligns with a broader global trend where established financial institutions are increasingly integrating digital assets into their portfolios and service offerings. By entering Brazil, FalconX is not just tapping into a new market; it’s actively participating in the global institutionalization of crypto. Who are FalconX Brazil’s Key Partners in This Venture? A strategic expansion of this magnitude requires strong local alliances, and FalconX Brazil has certainly secured formidable partners: BTG Pactual and Mercado Bitcoin. These collaborations are crucial for navigating the local regulatory landscape, understanding market nuances, and building trust within the Brazilian financial ecosystem. BTG Pactual: As Latin America’s largest investment bank, BTG Pactual brings unparalleled institutional reach and a deep understanding of the region’s financial markets. Their involvement lends significant credibility and access for FalconX, enabling them to connect with a vast network of potential institutional clients. BTG Pactual has been an early mover in the crypto space, having launched its own crypto trading platform and security token offerings, demonstrating their commitment to digital assets. Mercado Bitcoin: This is Brazil’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, boasting a massive user base and extensive operational experience in the local crypto market. Mercado Bitcoin’s expertise in retail and institutional crypto trading, coupled with its established infrastructure, will be invaluable for FalconX in offering seamless and secure services. Their partnership can facilitate liquidity and provide localized support, which are critical for success in a new market. These partnerships are not merely transactional; they represent a synergistic effort to build a more robust and accessible digital asset ecosystem in Brazil. By combining FalconX’s global prime brokerage capabilities with the local expertise and networks of BTG Pactual and Mercado Bitcoin, the venture is poised for significant impact. What Services Will FalconX Brazil Offer to Institutions? As a leading prime broker in the digital asset space, FalconX Brazil will extend its comprehensive suite of solutions designed specifically for institutional clients. These services are critical for institutions that require sophisticated tools for managing large-scale crypto investments while adhering to strict compliance and security standards. The core offerings will include: Trading Solutions: FalconX provides access to deep liquidity across various digital assets, enabling institutions to execute large trades with minimal slippage. Their sophisticated trading infrastructure supports algorithmic trading strategies, ensuring efficient and secure execution. This includes spot trading, derivatives, and potentially other complex instruments as the market evolves. Credit Solutions: Institutional clients often require flexible financing options to optimize their capital efficiency. FalconX offers tailored credit facilities, allowing institutions to leverage their digital assets for various purposes, such as hedging or yield generation. This is a crucial service for sophisticated investors looking to maximize their returns in the volatile crypto market. Custody Solutions: Secure storage of digital assets is paramount for institutions. FalconX provides institutional-grade custody solutions that prioritize security, regulatory compliance, and robust risk management. This often involves multi-signature wallets, cold storage, and comprehensive insurance policies to protect assets from theft or loss. These integrated services provide a holistic platform, reducing the operational complexities and risks associated with managing digital assets for large financial entities. The ‘prime brokerage’ model is essential because it offers a single point of access for various services, simplifying operations for institutions that might otherwise need to engage with multiple providers. How Are Regional Regulations Shaping the Institutional Crypto Landscape in Latin America? The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies in Latin America is dynamic and evolving, playing a significant role in fostering or hindering institutional adoption. While some countries are still grappling with how to regulate digital assets, others, like Brazil, are making significant strides in developing clear frameworks. This progress is a key factor attracting platforms like FalconX Brazil . Regulators in Brazil and other Latin American nations are increasingly engaging with the crypto industry to develop frameworks that balance innovation with investor protection and financial stability. This includes discussions around: Licensing and Supervision: Establishing clear guidelines for crypto exchanges, custodians, and other service providers. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) Rules: Implementing robust measures to prevent illicit financial activities. Taxation: Clarifying the tax treatment of digital asset transactions and holdings. Consumer Protection: Safeguarding retail and institutional investors from scams and market manipulation. The advancement of these crypto frameworks provides a much-needed sense of security and legitimacy for institutional investors. It reduces regulatory uncertainty, which is often a major barrier for traditional financial institutions considering entry into the digital asset space. As more clarity emerges, we can expect even greater institutional participation. This regulatory maturation is not just about compliance; it’s about creating a sustainable and trustworthy market where institutions can operate with confidence. FalconX’s entry underscores their belief in the long-term potential of a regulated and institutionalized crypto market in Brazil. What are the Potential Benefits and Challenges for FalconX Brazil? The expansion of FalconX Brazil into Latin America presents a compelling opportunity, but like any significant market entry, it comes with its own set of challenges. Benefits: Untapped Market Potential: Latin America, particularly Brazil, represents a vast and growing market for digital assets, with increasing institutional interest that is still relatively underserved by prime brokers. First-Mover Advantage (for prime brokerage): While retail crypto is popular, sophisticated institutional prime brokerage services are less saturated, giving FalconX a significant competitive edge. Strong Local Partnerships: Collaborations with BTG Pactual and Mercado Bitcoin provide immediate credibility, local market insights, and access to established networks, significantly easing market entry. Diversification: Expanding geographically reduces reliance on single markets and diversifies FalconX’s global client base. Catalyst for Regional Growth: FalconX’s presence can further accelerate institutional crypto adoption and infrastructure development across Latin America. Challenges: Regulatory Nuances: Despite progress, regulatory frameworks can vary significantly across Latin American countries and may evolve rapidly, requiring constant adaptation and compliance efforts. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile, posing risks for both FalconX and its institutional clients, requiring robust risk management systems. Competition: While prime brokerage might be less saturated, competition from local players and other global firms is inevitable as the market matures. Operational Complexities: Setting up and operating in a new region involves navigating different legal, tax, and operational environments, which can be complex and costly. Security Concerns: The digital asset space remains a target for cyberattacks, necessitating continuous investment in state-of-the-art security measures to protect client assets. Successfully navigating these challenges will be key to FalconX Brazil’s long-term success and its ability to solidify its position as a leading institutional crypto partner in the region. Actionable Insights for Institutions Considering Latin American Crypto Markets For institutions looking to follow in the footsteps of FalconX Brazil or engage with the burgeoning digital asset market in Latin America, here are some actionable insights: Understand Local Regulations: Before any significant investment, conduct thorough due diligence on the specific regulatory frameworks in each target country. Engage with legal experts specializing in crypto law. Prioritize Security and Compliance: Work only with reputable partners that offer institutional-grade security, robust AML/KYC procedures, and clear audit trails. Seek Local Partnerships: Collaborating with established local financial institutions or crypto firms can provide invaluable market access, expertise, and trust. Start Small and Scale: Consider a phased approach to market entry, starting with smaller allocations or specific use cases before committing to larger investments. Educate Your Team: Ensure your internal teams are well-versed in digital asset technologies, market dynamics, and risk management specific to cryptocurrencies. Focus on Long-Term Strategy: The crypto market is still relatively young. Develop a long-term strategy that accounts for market cycles, technological advancements, and regulatory changes. The institutionalization of crypto in Latin America is not a fleeting trend but a fundamental shift. By approaching it strategically and with due diligence, institutions can unlock significant opportunities. The Future is Bright: FalconX Brazil’s Vision for Digital Assets in Latin America The expansion of FalconX Brazil into Latin America marks a significant milestone in the global institutional adoption of digital assets. By bringing its prime brokerage expertise to a region ripe with demand and increasingly clear regulatory frameworks, FalconX is not just expanding its own footprint; it’s actively contributing to the maturation and legitimization of the crypto market in one of the world’s most dynamic economic zones. This move is a clear signal that Latin America is no longer just a nascent market for crypto; it’s becoming a central hub for innovation and institutional investment. As more regional banks and regulators continue to advance their crypto frameworks, the foundation for even greater growth and stability will be laid. FalconX, with its strategic partnerships and comprehensive service offerings, is well-positioned to be a cornerstone of this exciting future, helping to unlock the full potential of digital assets for institutions across the continent.

2025-07-29T13:23:19,"Crypto Mining Blamed for Up to 20% of Iran’s Power Imbalance","Iranian officials have raised concerns over the rising strain crypto mining is placing on the nation’s electricity grid, claiming that the activity now contributes to as much as 20% of the country’s energy imbalance. Key Takeaways: Iranian officials say crypto mining now contributes up to 20% of the country’s electricity shortfall. Over 900,000 illegal mining devices were recently shut down during a nationwide internet outage. Authorities are ramping up enforcement, seizing over 250,000 unauthorized rigs across multiple provinces. Speaking on Monday, Mohammad Allahdad, deputy head of Iran’s state-run power company Tavanir, said crypto mining operations are consuming nearly 2,000 megawatts (MW) of electricity, equivalent to the output of two Bushehr nuclear reactors. Although this represents just 5% of the country’s overall consumption, the impact on Iran’s current energy deficit is far more severe. Crypto Mining Fuels 20% of Iran’s Power Shortfall, Says Official “Crypto mining now accounts for up to 20% of the shortfall in our electricity grid,” Allahdad stated, describing the figure as both significant and alarming. He cited data from a recent nationwide internet outage linked to the conflict with Israel, which caused power usage to drop by 2,400 MW, largely due to the shutdown of over 900,000 unauthorized mining devices. The strain is being felt most acutely during Iran’s scorching summer, when power demand spikes due to widespread use of air conditioning, agricultural operations, and industrial production. Allahdad warned that illegal mining during peak hours can lead to voltage drops, equipment damage, and even fires caused by the heat generated by the machines. Authorities have discovered that many mining farms are hidden in abandoned homes , warehouses, or unused industrial buildings. Tavanir has launched a public reporting initiative, offering rewards of up to 200 million tomans (around $2,300) to individuals who report unauthorized mining activity. Hadi Sefidmou, who heads Iran’s crypto mining oversight task force, added that producing one Bitcoin with outdated equipment can consume up to one million kilowatt-hours—equivalent to the annual electricity use of 440 Iranian households. Even with newer hardware, each mining unit still consumes as much power as 12 homes. About 1 in every 32 Bitcoin may be mined in Iran According to some reports, Iran may account for ~3.1% of global BTC mining. Why? They figured out how to turn oil into crypto to dodge sanctions and spend freely. How it works: Domestic model: Burn oil/gas to power rigs… — Nic (@nicrypto) June 26, 2025 In response, enforcement actions are ramping up. More than 250,000 illegal miners have been seized across multiple provinces, including Tehran, Isfahan, Fars, and East Azarbaijan. Just this week, 108 rigs were discovered in an abandoned Ahvaz factory, while another bust in Alborz province uncovered 168 unauthorized devices between March and June. With electricity demand now exceeding 70,000 MW, officials say addressing illicit mining is no longer optional. Chinese Roots Still Dominate Global Bitcoin Mining As reported, over half of the world’s Bitcoin mining operations still trace their origins to China , with 55% to 65% of mining linked to Chinese capital, hardware, or expertise, according to Uminers CEO Batyr Hydyrov. Despite China’s 2021 mining ban, key Chinese players have maintained influence by relocating operations overseas. Major Chinese manufacturers Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT, responsible for 99% of Bitcoin mining hardware, have shifted production to the U.S. to avoid tariffs, helping boost America’s share of Bitcoin’s total hashrate from 4% in 2019 to 38% today. Hydyrov added that former Chinese miners have often increased capacity after moving abroad, with some expanding by up to 150%, and noted that limited mining still persists within China’s remote regions where enforcement is lax.

2025-07-29T13:23:11,"Bad News from Analysts: Bitcoin Correction May Extend! ""First Seen Since May!""","Bitcoin (BTC) broke a new ATH record by climbing above $123,000 in mid-July. However, it has been unable to sustain above $120,000 and continues to consolidate between $110,000 and $120,000. While it remains unclear which direction Bitcoin will move, one analyst noted that the BTC premium on Coinbase has turned negative for the first time since late May, which could be a sign that the correction is continuing. According to Coindesk, market analyst Omkar Godbole noted that the Coinbase BTC premium, a key indicator of demand from US investors, has turned negative after a historic 60-day run. Bitcoin has been trading at a higher price on Coinbase than on Binance for the past 60 days. This typically indicates strong buying interest from US investors, particularly large institutions. However, this premium has now reversed for the first time since late May, and Bitcoin is cheaper on Coinbase than on Binance. At this point, the analyst said that the Coinbase BTC premium turning negative for the first time since the end of May indicates that the buying pressure from US investors has decreased. According to the analyst, this signals a significant shift in market dynamics. US investor demand is weakening, and as a result, Bitcoin's correction could continue. Summer Stagnation in Bitcoin! Apart from this, the crypto analysis platform Matrixport also made a similar analysis. Matrixport analysts stated that stagnation will prevail in the BTC price due to the historical summer months recession. At this point, analysts stated that with no significant catalyst expected in August and investor participation decreasing, Bitcoin could enter a short-term correction or move sideways. “Trading volume is likely to decline further in August due to the absence of specific catalysts and the traditional holiday season, which sees reduced retail investor participation. Therefore, we predict that Bitcoin may enter a short-term correction or sideways trend.” *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Bad News from Analysts: Bitcoin Correction May Extend!

2025-07-29T13:22:32,"RAKBANK introduces dirham-based crypto trading via app, joins UAE’s fintech push","RAKBANK has taken a significant step toward mainstreaming cryptocurrency in the United Arab Emirates by enabling customers to trade digital assets directly through its mobile app. This new feature eliminates the need for conversions to foreign currencies or reliance on offshore platforms, marking the first such move by a traditional UAE bank. In partnership with Bitpanda, a Europe-based crypto platform, the bank is offering buy, sell, and swap services in dirhams, providing a fully localised and regulated crypto experience. The move aligns with the UAE’s broader fintech strategy to become a digital asset hub and provides residents with a simplified entry point into crypto markets. Until now, users were largely dependent on international platforms such as Binance or Coinbase, where they had to convert AED to USD and navigate fees and cross-border regulatory risks. RAKBANK’s new offering allows users to bypass those steps entirely. Bitpanda’s regulated entry reinforces trust Bitpanda Broker MENA DMCC, a subsidiary of Austria-headquartered Bitpanda, is powering the back-end of this service. The firm is regulated under Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) and is already partnered with key financial institutions in Europe, including Deutsche Bank and Raiffeisen Bank. Its integration into RAKBANK’s ecosystem adds regulatory credibility and technological infrastructure to the offering. While the service is currently accessible by invitation only, the bank plans to expand access in the coming months. Supported tokens at launch include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Ripple (XRP), with more assets to be added progressively. Trades are executed and settled entirely in AED, and users can access crypto directly from their savings or current accounts without leaving the RAKBANK platform. Local banking meets global crypto innovation RAKBANK’s launch represents a significant shift in how banks and consumers interact with digital assets in the region. Prior to this, access to cryptocurrency typically involved third-party platforms outside local regulatory jurisdiction. These platforms required foreign currency exchanges and often lacked integration with users’ primary banking services. By embedding crypto access directly into its mobile banking app, RAKBANK removes key barriers to adoption, especially for users who prefer the security and familiarity of a regulated local institution. This could signal a broader shift in banking behaviour, where traditional financial players begin to integrate digital asset services to stay competitive and meet evolving consumer expectations. UAE builds momentum in digital assets RAKBANK’s move comes as Dubai and the broader UAE continue their aggressive push into the digital asset space. The Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC) free zone is already home to more than 600 crypto-related firms. The government has also greenlit several major projects, including the issuance of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin. By launching this feature, RAKBANK positions itself at the forefront of banking innovation in the region. Its crypto service could potentially serve as a blueprint for other local institutions exploring entry into the digital assets market. The full rollout is expected to be closely watched, not only by consumers but also by regulatory and banking circles across the Gulf.

2025-07-29T13:08:34,"$187K in 90 seconds: why BPENGU might be the best crypto to buy now","The penguins aren’t just marching — they’re taking over. In a presale launch that defied expectations and shattered norms, Bitcoin Penguins (BPENGU) raised a staggering $187,000 within the first 90 seconds of going live. Just 24 hours in, it has already crossed $1 million — and it’s still climbing fast. In a market that’s itching for its next breakout star, BPENGU has emerged with perfect timing. With Bitcoin trading near $119,000, only a few thousand dollars below its all-time high, and penguin-themed assets like Pudgy Penguins soaring over 200% in the past month, the appetite for meme-fueled upside is very real. But BPENGU isn’t just another meme coin chasing the hype. It’s positioning itself as a smarter, faster, Bitcoin-native evolution of what Pudgy Penguins helped start. Why BPENGU has captured the market’s imagination Data on its website shows the momentum is real: over $1 million raised in a day. And that’s not just a sign of strong demand — it’s validation of the project’s hybrid appeal. BPENGU blends the cultural firepower of meme tokens with the credibility of Bitcoin’s infrastructure. While Pudgy Penguins operates on Ethereum, Bitcoin Penguins is built on Bitcoin itself — setting it apart in a space where most meme coins are purely speculative. The team is also targeting a $2 price by November, which would mark a 1,000% gain from presale levels and put the project at a $1 billion fully diluted valuation. A presale with precision and urgency The structure behind the hype is just as compelling. The BPENGU presale spans 15 fixed stages, with the token price climbing 5% at each step. Early buyers can lock in up to 75% in notional gains before the token even lists. There’s no open-ended fundraising, no indefinite wait. The presale ends August 27, or sooner if the $10 million cap is reached. The claim and listing date is already set for September 2 — giving investors something rare: transparency and trust. The next price jump kicks in within 24 hours, turning up the heat on an already fast-moving sale. Could the Fed be the catalyst? All eyes are on this week’s Fed meeting, where policymakers are widely expected to hold interest rates steady. That signal of stability could help propel Bitcoin higher — and meme coins like BPENGU even further. With Bitcoin near record highs, memes back in style, and penguin mania running wild, BPENGU is doing what most tokens can’t: backing up its hype with real momentum, structure, and timing.

As part of the new framework, Hong Kong will also launch a public registry of licensed stablecoin issuers. “In the future, the public may refer to the register of licensed stablecoin issuers as shown on the HKMA’s website,” the regulator said. At a media briefing, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) said the city’s stablecoin regulations will take effect this Friday, August 1. However, the first licences for stablecoin issuers are now expected to be granted in early 2026. Many in the market had hoped the licences would be issued this year, but the HKMA’s comments suggest it’s taking a more cautious approach. The regulator added, “Considering Hong Kong’s well-established systems, we do not expect to achieve large-scale (stablecoin adoption) immediately in the early stages. Instead, we aim to progress step by step, gradually driving the digital transformation of Hong Kong.” The HKMA is encouraging anyone interested in applying for a stablecoin license to get in touch with the regulator by August 1. To be considered for the first round of approvals, applicants must also submit their full applications by September 30. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : White House to Release Crypto Policy Report on July 30, XRP and Bitcoin in Focus , The HKMA Warns Against Hype and Scams The HKMA made it clear that, as of now, no stablecoin licences have been granted, and cautioned the public against trusting individuals or companies claiming to be licensed or regulated in Hong Kong. The new guidelines require stablecoin issuers to follow rules on managing reserves, issuing and redeeming coins, handling risks, and running their operations properly. To prevent money laundering, licensed issuers must check customers’ identities, manage wallet risks, follow rules for tracking transfers, and keep an eye on transactions. The HKMA also said it will carry out checks and investigations if the rules are broken and can take action against those who don’t comply. Authorities also advised skepticism toward those saying they are in the process of applying, stressing that anyone holding unlicensed stablecoins is doing so at their own risk. The HKMA expressed concern over growing hype in the market. Chief Executive Eddie pointed to a surge in excitement around stablecoins that had triggered sharp increases in trading activity and stock prices, moves the regulator believes were largely unwarranted. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

This new “Pay with Crypto” feature also allows seamless conversion into fiat or stablecoins like PayPal’s PYUSD, offering merchants lower fees, faster settlements, and 4% APY on PYUSD holdings.

Launch of “PayPal World” to expand global crypto commerce. Bitcoin Holds Steady Despite US-EU Trade Relief Elsewhere, the macro backdrop is also supportive. A new U.S.-EU trade agreement reduced threatened tariffs from 30% to 15%, adding a modest lift to global market sentiment. While the updated rate remains higher than the U.K.’s 10%, it’s still seen as a positive step ahead of the upcoming U.S.-China trade deadline on August 1. US equities extended their climb as a weekend trade deal with the EU fueled optimism ahead of a jam-packed week https://t.co/2y7aPzes8J — Bloomberg (@business) July 28, 2025 These developments have helped boost confidence across equities and crypto, but Bitcoin continues to trade sideways. As of today, BTC is stuck between $116,000 and $120,000—a narrow range, given the scale of the headlines. Market participants now await this week’s Federal Reserve interest rate decision for potential direction. Despite positive sentiment, Bitcoin appears reluctant to commit to a breakout. That said, this period of low volatility could be the calm before the storm, especially considering the technical setup. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: Triangle Break Imminent Bitcoin is coiling tightly within a symmetrical triangle pattern, a classic formation that often precedes major moves. Price is pressing just below $121,090 resistance, the top of the structure, while the base near $117,441 continues to provide firm support. A clean break in either direction could trigger a multi-thousand-dollar move. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The RSI hovers around 55.46—neutral but leaning bullish—while price action remains above the 50-SMA (currently at $118,201). A breakout above $121,100 could open the door to $125,645, while a breakout below $117,400 risks sliding toward $114,500. Trade Setup: Buy above $121,100 , stop at $118,100, target $125,000 Sell below $117,400 , stop at $121,000, target $114,500 With PayPal enabling widespread BTC use and global sentiment improving, Bitcoin’s next breakout could mark the beginning of its next major rally. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Over $5.7M as Price Rise Nears Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), has raised over $5.7 million in its public presale, with $5,700,020 out of a $6,102,789 target. The token is priced at $0.01245, with the next price tier expected to be announced soon. Designed to merge Bitcoin’s security with Solana’s speed, Bitcoin Hyper enables fast, low-cost smart contracts, dApps, and meme coin creation, all with seamless BTC bridging. The project is audited by Consult and engineered for scalability, trust, and simplicity. The golden cross of meme appeal and real utility has made Bitcoin Hyper a Layer 2 contender to watch in 2025.

2025-07-29T13:00:12,"Unlocking Stability: BlackRock’s Take on How Stablecoin Rules Could Bolster the Dollar","BitcoinWorld Unlocking Stability: BlackRock’s Take on How Stablecoin Rules Could Bolster the Dollar Imagine a world where the U.S. dollar, already the global reserve currency, gains an unprecedented boost through digital innovation. This isn’t science fiction; it’s a future that financial titan BlackRock is keenly observing. Recently, BlackRock strategists made a compelling statement: the right kind of stablecoin rules , specifically a framework like the U.S. GENIUS Act, could significantly strengthen the U.S. dollar’s global standing. For anyone tracking the intersection of traditional finance and the burgeoning crypto space, this perspective from one of the world’s largest asset managers is nothing short of fascinating. BlackRock’s Bold Prediction: Could Stablecoin Rules Truly Boost the Dollar? When BlackRock speaks, the financial world listens. Their recent insights, as reported by Walter Bloomberg on X, suggest that a well-structured regulatory framework for dollar-pegged stablecoins could be a game-changer for the U.S. dollar. This isn’t just about making crypto more accessible; it’s about fundamentally enhancing the dollar’s utility and reach on a global scale. But how exactly would stablecoin rules achieve such a profound impact? The core of BlackRock’s argument rests on two pivotal mechanisms: Enabling a Tokenized Payment System: Imagine a digital infrastructure where transactions are not only instantaneous but also significantly cheaper and more efficient. Stablecoins, particularly those firmly pegged to the U.S. dollar and operating under clear regulations, could power such a system. This would streamline cross-border payments, trade finance, and even everyday consumer transactions, making the dollar more fluid and functional than ever before. Easier Access for Emerging Markets: For countries grappling with volatile local currencies, access to a stable, reliable medium of exchange is critical. U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins, governed by robust stablecoin rules , offer a digital gateway to the dollar. This provides a lifeline for businesses and individuals in emerging economies, allowing them to participate more securely in the global economy without the constant threat of hyperinflation or currency depreciation. The GENIUS Act: What Does This Regulatory Framework Mean for the Future of Money? The U.S. GENIUS Act (Generating Innovative New Ideas for the United States Act), though still in legislative discussions, represents a significant step towards formalizing the regulatory landscape for stablecoins. It aims to provide clarity and oversight, crucial elements for institutional adoption and widespread public trust. BlackRock’s focus on this specific framework highlights the importance of thoughtful, comprehensive stablecoin rules that can foster innovation while mitigating risks. A well-defined regulatory environment would offer: Aspect Impact of Clear Stablecoin Rules Consumer Protection Safeguards against fraud and mismanagement, building public confidence. Financial Stability Ensuring stablecoin reserves are fully backed and transparent, preventing systemic risks. Market Integrity Preventing illicit activities like money laundering and terrorist financing. Innovation & Competition Providing a clear runway for companies to develop new products and services using stablecoins. Without clear stablecoin rules , the potential for these digital assets to truly integrate into the global financial system remains limited. The GENIUS Act, or similar legislation, is seen as essential for unlocking the dollar’s full digital potential. Beyond Borders: How Stablecoin Rules Could Empower Emerging Economies? One of the most profound impacts of robust stablecoin rules , as highlighted by BlackRock, lies in their ability to empower emerging markets. Many developing nations face persistent challenges with currency instability, which can cripple economic growth, deter foreign investment, and erode the savings of ordinary citizens. In such environments, accessing a stable currency like the U.S. dollar is paramount, but traditional banking channels can be slow, costly, and inaccessible to many. Stablecoins offer a compelling alternative: Reduced Transaction Costs: Sending remittances or making international payments can be prohibitively expensive through traditional banking systems. Stablecoins facilitate cheaper, faster transfers. Inflation Hedge: For individuals and businesses in countries with high inflation, holding dollar-pegged stablecoins can protect their purchasing power. Greater Financial Inclusion: Stablecoins can be accessed via mobile phones, potentially reaching millions who are unbanked or underbanked in remote areas, providing them with a digital gateway to global finance. Enhanced Trade: Businesses in emerging markets can conduct international trade more efficiently and predictably, reducing currency risk. By providing a reliable, digital conduit to the U.S. dollar, clear stablecoin rules could foster economic stability and growth in regions that need it most, ultimately strengthening the dollar’s role as the preferred global currency. Are There Hurdles? Examining the Challenges and Opportunities for Stablecoin Rules While the potential benefits are significant, implementing effective stablecoin rules is not without its challenges. Policymakers must navigate a complex landscape that balances innovation with necessary oversight. Some key considerations include: Regulatory Fragmentation: Different jurisdictions may adopt varying approaches to stablecoin regulation, potentially creating inconsistencies and hindering global interoperability. Technological Evolution: The rapid pace of blockchain technology development means that regulations must be flexible enough to adapt to future innovations without stifling them. Balancing Privacy and Compliance: Ensuring user privacy while adhering to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) regulations is a delicate balance. Market Dominance Concerns: The rise of dominant stablecoins could raise antitrust concerns if not managed properly. Despite these hurdles, the opportunities presented by clear stablecoin rules are immense. The U.S. has a chance to solidify its position as a leader in digital finance, fostering a secure and efficient global payment ecosystem that leverages the strength of the dollar. What’s Next? Your Guide to Understanding the Evolving Landscape of Stablecoin Rules The conversation around stablecoin rules is evolving rapidly, driven by legislative efforts like the GENIUS Act and the growing interest from major financial players like BlackRock. For individuals, businesses, and policymakers, understanding these developments is crucial. The future of global payments, and indeed the U.S. dollar’s role within it, may well be shaped by how effectively these digital currencies are integrated into the existing financial system. Actionable Insights: For Investors: Keep an eye on legislative progress regarding stablecoin regulation. Clear rules could de-risk stablecoin investments and increase their utility, potentially impacting the broader crypto market. For Businesses: Explore how tokenized payment systems powered by regulated stablecoins could reduce transaction costs, speed up settlements, and open new markets, especially for international operations. For Policymakers: The urgency of establishing comprehensive and adaptable stablecoin rules cannot be overstated. Proactive regulation can secure the U.S.’s financial leadership in the digital age. BlackRock’s perspective underscores a pivotal moment: stablecoins are no longer just a niche crypto asset. With the right regulatory foundation, they have the potential to become a powerful tool for reinforcing the U.S. dollar’s global dominance, fostering financial inclusion, and ushering in a new era of efficient digital payments. The path forward involves careful consideration, but the potential rewards are substantial. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a stablecoin? A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar, or to a commodity like gold. This stability is achieved by backing the stablecoin with reserves, making it less volatile than other cryptocurrencies. How could stablecoin rules strengthen the U.S. dollar? By providing a clear regulatory framework, stablecoin rules can increase trust and adoption of dollar-pegged stablecoins. This enables more efficient, tokenized payment systems globally and gives emerging markets easier, more reliable access to the U.S. dollar, enhancing its utility and demand worldwide. What is the U.S. GENIUS Act? The GENIUS Act (Generating Innovative New Ideas for the United States Act) is proposed U.S. legislation aimed at establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins. It seeks to provide clarity, consumer protection, and promote financial stability within the digital asset space. What are the benefits of stablecoins for emerging markets? Stablecoins offer emerging markets a stable alternative to volatile local currencies, facilitate cheaper and faster international remittances, and provide greater financial inclusion for unbanked populations by offering digital access to a stable currency like the U.S. dollar. What are the main challenges in implementing effective stablecoin rules? Key challenges include ensuring regulatory consistency across jurisdictions, adapting regulations to rapid technological advancements, balancing user privacy with compliance requirements (AML/CTF), and addressing potential market dominance concerns.
