2025-07-29T16:55:15,"Scammers Drain $27,000 From Bank of America Customer After Duping Victim With Apple Wallet Trick: Report","A scammer reportedly drained $27,000 in life savings from a man in Arizona by pretending to be his bank representative. An Arizona resident who wants to only be identified as Dave tells the website Moneywise.com that he received a normal-looking fraud alert from Bank of America, which questioned whether he had authorized a $399 purchase at the electronics store Best Buy. Dave responded, saying “no,” and then reportedly received a follow-up text from the scammer with a number to call. Someone claiming to be a Bank of America (BofA) representative then told Dave over the phone that his account had been compromised and that he was being targeted by a rogue BofA employee. The con artist told Dave to withdraw his whole bank account to protect it, and then the scammer instructed him to “secure” the cash using Apple Wallet. Dave was then walked through creating a scannable card on his phone that was linked to the scammer’s account. The Arizona man then deposited the cash in a bank drive-through, unwittingly transferring the money to a scammer. “This is my life savings, and I don’t have any assurances, but they sounded so real.” Peoria Police Department Detective Michael Finney worked with Dave and froze the linked accounts, managing to recover roughly 90% of his funds in five months.

2025-07-29T16:50:33,"BitMine Bets Big: $1B Buyback Follows $2.3B ETH Hoard – A 5% Ethereum Grab in Sight?","BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) has kicked off a $1 billion stock buyback program as its Ethereum (ETH) holdings soar past 625,000 ETH, worth $2.3 billion, cementing its position as the largest corporate holder of the asset to date. The company’s open-ended buyback, revealed July 29 , allows it to repurchase shares via open-market or private deals, with no expiry. It’s the latest move in BitMine’s escalating bid to accumulate 5% of Ethereum’s total supply. BitMine to Repurchase Shares as Part of Long-Term Ethereum Strategy 1/ Bitmine is today announcing a $1 billion stock repurchase program. Per Tom Lee @fundstrat , Chairman of Bitmine: “In our road to achieving ‘the alchemy of 5%’ of ETH, there may be times when the best expected return of our capital is to acquire our own shares” ticker:… — Bitmine BMNR (@BitMNR) July 29, 2025 “In our road to achieving ‘the alchemy of 5%,’ there may be times when the best expected return of our capital is to acquire our own shares,” said chairman Tom Lee, who also leads Fundstrat. With ETH trading at $3,755 and BTC at $118,021 on July 28, BitMine’s net asset value per share hit $22.76, bolstered by $401.4 million in unencumbered cash, 192 BTC, and its ETH treasury. The announcement comes just days after BitMine revealed its goal to acquire and stake 5% of Ethereum’s total supply, approximately six million ETH, depending on Ethereum’s issuance. If successful, the company would hold a larger share of ETH than MicroStrategy does of Bitcoin. Just last week, the company revealed a stunning 566,776 ETH purchase in only 16 days , worth $2.03 billion at the time, vaulting it ahead of rivals like SharpLink Gaming and even the Ethereum Foundation. BMNR shares have exploded more than 3,000% since early July, reaching $135 following the announcement of its Ether accumulation plan. The company’s options on its stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in July , giving investors new tools to engage with the company’s equity. Meanwhile, competitors are scrambling to catch up. SharpLink added 77,210 ETH over the weekend, bringing its total to 438,017 ETH, worth $1.7 billion. But BitMine still holds the lead in what’s shaping up to be the crypto space’s most aggressive treasury accumulation race. Institutional Accumulation and On-chain Trends Indicate Structural Bullishness for ETH Currently, 6.73% of all ETH, or about 8.12 million tokens worth over $31 billion, is held collectively by corporations and ETFs, according to data from Strategic ETH Reserve (SER). The total strategic Ethereum reserves account for 2.33 million ETH, valued at $8.9 billion and representing 1.93% of the total ETH supply. The reserves include 65 participants and have seen a steady increase in holdings since mid-April, with a sharp rise beginning in late June. Meanwhile, ETH ETFs hold 5.82 million ETH , valued at $22.23 billion. Inflows have been consistent, with 17 consecutive days of net additions totaling more than 433,000 ETH during the past week alone. This uptick reflects renewed institutional interest and capital allocation to Ethereum-based products. Combined, the Ethereum reserves and ETFs now hold nearly 7% of the entire ETH supply. Ethereum’s supply dynamics continue to show bullish structural signs. Over 34 million ETH, around 28% of the total 120.7 million supply, is currently staked. This staked amount is effectively locked and unavailable for trading, reducing the liquid supply and indicating long-term investor confidence. Exchange balances have also hit a multi-year low of 16.2 million ETH, the lowest level since 2016. This drop in sell-side liquidity supports upward price pressure, especially as demand increases. According to Glassnode, the amount of ETH held by first-time buyers has risen by 16% since early July, hinting at a fresh wave of retail and institutional adoption. Analysts at Glassnode called it the first meaningful trend reversal in recent ETH cycles.

2025-07-29T16:45:10,"Urgent Alert: Crypto Whale Liquidation Averted by AguilaTrades on Hyperliquid","BitcoinWorld Urgent Alert: Crypto Whale Liquidation Averted by AguilaTrades on Hyperliquid The cryptocurrency market is a realm of exhilarating highs and nerve-wracking lows, where fortunes can be made or lost in the blink of an eye. At the heart of this volatile ecosystem are ‘whales’ – powerful entities whose colossal holdings and strategic moves can send ripples, or even tsunamis, across the digital ocean. Recently, the crypto community watched with bated breath as one such titan, known as AguilaTrades on the Hyperliquid platform, made a critical decision to avoid a catastrophic Crypto Whale Liquidation event. This isn’t just a story about numbers; it’s a vivid illustration of the high stakes, immense pressures, and strategic maneuvers that define the world of large-scale crypto trading. Decoding the AguilaTrades Saga: Averting a Crypto Whale Liquidation The news broke through Lookonchain on X (formerly Twitter), revealing that AguilaTrades, a prominent figure on the Hyperliquid exchange, had taken decisive action. To prevent the forced closure of his highly leveraged positions – a process known as liquidation – he opted to voluntarily close a significant portion of his long Bitcoin (BTC) holdings. This move, while strategic, came at a steep price, highlighting the inherent risks in the pursuit of amplified gains. What exactly happened? The Trader: AguilaTrades, identified as a significant ‘whale’ on Hyperliquid. The Action: Voluntarily closed part of extensive long BTC positions. The Reason: To preemptively avoid a full-scale crypto whale liquidation , which would have resulted in even greater losses. Current Holdings: Post-closure, AguilaTrades still holds a substantial 1,000 BTC, valued at approximately $117.65 million at the time of the report. The Cost: The strategic exit resulted in total losses exceeding a staggering $38 million. This incident serves as a stark reminder that even the most experienced and well-capitalized traders are not immune to the market’s unpredictable swings. The decision to cut losses, though painful, underscores a fundamental principle of risk management in highly leveraged trading environments. Who Are Crypto Whales and Why Do Their Moves Matter? In the vast ocean of cryptocurrency, ‘whales’ are individuals or entities that hold exceptionally large amounts of digital assets, typically enough to influence market prices. Their sheer volume of holdings gives them significant power, and their trading activities are closely scrutinized by market observers. Why are they so important? Market Movers: A large buy or sell order from a whale can cause significant price fluctuations, impacting the portfolios of countless smaller traders. Sentiment Indicators: Whale movements are often seen as indicators of broader market sentiment. If whales are accumulating, it might signal confidence; if they’re offloading, it could suggest a downturn. Liquidity Providers: They often provide substantial liquidity to exchanges, facilitating smoother trading, but their sudden withdrawals can create liquidity crunches. Potential for Cascading Effects: A forced crypto whale liquidation , especially on a large scale, can trigger a domino effect, leading to further price drops as collateral is sold off. AguilaTrades’ decision to avoid liquidation wasn’t just about his personal finances; it potentially prevented a larger ripple effect that could have exacerbated market volatility for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Understanding Liquidation in Crypto Trading: A Trader’s Nightmare For anyone involved in leveraged trading, ‘liquidation’ is a word that sends shivers down the spine. It’s the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange due to insufficient margin to cover potential losses. When the value of a trader’s collateral falls below a certain threshold, the exchange automatically sells off the assets to prevent further losses to itself and to ensure the debt is covered. How Liquidation Works in a Nutshell: Term Explanation Leverage Borrowing funds to amplify potential returns (and risks) from a trade. For example, 10x leverage means you trade with 10 times your capital. Margin The collateral (your own funds) deposited with the exchange to open and maintain a leveraged position. Margin Call A notification from the exchange requesting a trader to deposit more funds into their margin account to avoid liquidation. Liquidation Price A specific price point at which the value of a trader’s collateral becomes insufficient, triggering the automatic closure of the position. Forced Closure The automatic selling of a trader’s assets by the exchange to cover losses and outstanding borrowed funds. This often happens at unfavorable market prices. The danger for a crypto whale liquidation is amplified by the sheer size of their positions. A forced sale of hundreds or thousands of Bitcoins can create significant sell pressure, leading to a rapid price decline that can trigger further liquidations across the market – a phenomenon known as a ‘liquidation cascade’. AguilaTrades’ proactive decision to close positions, though costly, prevented such a cascade from potentially originating from his holdings. Hyperliquid’s Role in High-Stakes Trading: What Makes It Unique? Hyperliquid is a decentralized perpetual exchange built on its own blockchain, known for its high throughput and low latency. It allows traders to engage in perpetual futures trading, offering significant leverage on various cryptocurrencies. Why is Hyperliquid a preferred platform for large traders like AguilaTrades? Decentralized Nature: Offers self-custody of funds and transparent on-chain operations, appealing to those wary of centralized exchange risks. High Leverage Options: Provides substantial leverage, allowing traders to open large positions with relatively smaller capital, though this amplifies both gains and losses. Deep Liquidity: Attracts large market makers and traders, ensuring sufficient liquidity even for massive orders. Performance: Designed for speed and efficiency, crucial for high-frequency and large-volume trading. The environment on Hyperliquid, while offering immense opportunities for profit, also demands sophisticated risk management, as AguilaTrades’ experience vividly demonstrates. The platform’s features, while enabling large trades, also make the consequences of a potential crypto whale liquidation particularly impactful. The Broader Market Implications: When Whales Make Waves The actions of a single crypto whale, especially one facing a potential liquidation, can have far-reaching implications for the entire market. When a position of AguilaTrades’ size is at risk, the entire crypto community pays attention. Potential Market Impacts: Price Volatility: A forced liquidation would have dumped 1,000 BTC onto the market instantly, potentially causing a sharp price drop for Bitcoin. Fear and Uncertainty: News of a major whale’s liquidation can trigger panic selling among smaller investors, exacerbating a downturn. Liquidation Cascades: A large liquidation can push prices down to the liquidation levels of other leveraged positions, creating a chain reaction of forced sales. Investor Confidence: Such events can erode trust in the stability of the market, particularly among newer participants. By proactively closing positions, AguilaTrades, albeit unintentionally, mitigated some of these potential negative market impacts. It underscores the delicate balance within the crypto ecosystem and why vigilance over potential crypto whale liquidation events is a constant necessity for market participants. Lessons from AguilaTrades: Navigating Volatility and Preventing Liquidation The AguilaTrades incident offers invaluable lessons for all traders, regardless of their portfolio size. It highlights that even the biggest players are susceptible to market forces and the inherent risks of leverage. Key Takeaways for Traders: Prioritize Risk Management: This is paramount. Always understand your liquidation price, use stop-loss orders, and never over-leverage. AguilaTrades’ $38 million loss, while massive, could have been far worse if a full liquidation had occurred. Understand Leverage: While leverage can amplify gains, it equally amplifies losses. Be conservative with your leverage, especially in volatile markets. Position Sizing: Ensure your position size is appropriate for your capital and risk tolerance. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, even if that basket holds Bitcoin. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market sentiment, on-chain data (like whale movements), and macroeconomic factors that can influence crypto prices. Emotional Discipline: Making rational decisions, like cutting losses, is crucial, even when emotions run high due to significant paper losses. The prudent decision to avoid a full crypto whale liquidation by taking a substantial, yet contained, loss speaks volumes about the importance of strategic foresight and disciplined trading, even for market giants. What’s Next for AguilaTrades and the Crypto Market? While AguilaTrades has absorbed a significant loss, the fact that he still holds a substantial amount of BTC indicates his continued belief in the asset. His future trading strategies will undoubtedly be watched closely by the community, particularly on Hyperliquid. For the broader crypto market, this event serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent volatility and the constant need for vigilance. The market will continue to evolve, with new whales emerging and existing ones navigating the ever-changing tides. However, the principles of risk management, understanding leverage, and making calculated decisions to avoid a disastrous crypto whale liquidation will remain timeless for anyone daring to venture into the deep and exciting waters of cryptocurrency trading. Conclusion: A Prudent Escape from the Brink of Crypto Whale Liquidation The AguilaTrades saga on Hyperliquid stands as a compelling narrative of risk, resilience, and strategic retreat in the volatile world of cryptocurrency. By closing long positions and absorbing a significant $38 million loss, this prominent whale successfully averted a full-blown liquidation event, potentially saving even greater financial damage and preventing wider market ripples. This incident underscores the critical importance of robust risk management, even for the most formidable players in the market. It serves as a vivid reminder that in the high-stakes arena of leveraged crypto trading, prudence often outweighs aggressive pursuit of gains, safeguarding against the devastating consequences of a forced crypto whale liquidation . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a ‘crypto whale’? A crypto whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency, typically enough to influence its market price through their buying or selling activities. 2. What does it mean to ‘close positions to avoid liquidation’? It means a trader proactively sells or closes their leveraged trading positions before the market price reaches a point where the exchange would automatically force the closure of their position (liquidation) due to insufficient collateral. This is done to limit losses and maintain control over their assets. 3. How does liquidation work in cryptocurrency trading? Liquidation occurs in leveraged trading when the value of a trader’s collateral (margin) falls below a certain threshold due to adverse price movements. The exchange then automatically sells off the trader’s assets to cover the borrowed funds and prevent further losses. 4. What is Hyperliquid? Hyperliquid is a decentralized perpetual exchange built on its own blockchain, allowing users to trade perpetual futures contracts with high leverage and deep liquidity, all while maintaining self-custody of their funds. 5. What was the approximate loss for AguilaTrades in this event? According to reports, AguilaTrades incurred total losses exceeding $38 million by closing part of his long Bitcoin positions to prevent liquidation. 6. How do crypto whale actions, like avoiding liquidation, impact the broader market? Whale actions can significantly impact market sentiment and price volatility. A large, forced liquidation could trigger a ‘liquidation cascade’ and lead to sharp price drops. By avoiding liquidation, AguilaTrades potentially prevented a more severe market downturn that could have been triggered by the forced sale of his large BTC holdings.

2025-07-29T16:40:12,"Ethereum ETFs: The Astonishing Surge Reshaping Crypto Investments","BitcoinWorld Ethereum ETFs: The Astonishing Surge Reshaping Crypto Investments The world of cryptocurrency investment is witnessing a fascinating shift, and at the heart of this transformation are Ethereum ETFs . For years, Bitcoin has reigned supreme, dominating headlines and investment portfolios. However, recent data suggests a compelling narrative unfolding, one where Ethereum is not just catching up but actively reshaping the landscape of digital asset investments. This isn’t just a minor blip on the radar; it’s a significant realignment that demands attention from every investor, enthusiast, and market observer. Are Ethereum ETFs Truly Reshaping the Crypto Landscape? Absolutely. The buzz around Ethereum ETFs is more than just market chatter; it’s backed by concrete data. Bloomberg exchange-traded fund (ETF) analyst Eric Balchunas recently highlighted a remarkable trend on X (formerly Twitter): the rising inflows into Ethereum ETFs are undeniably eating away at Bitcoin’s long-held market share. This isn’t a speculative prediction but an observation of current market dynamics. Just two months ago, Bitcoin ETFs commanded a staggering 90% of total crypto ETF assets under management (AUM). Today, that figure has dropped to 82%. In contrast, Ethereum’s slice of the pie has grown to a significant 13% and continues its upward trajectory. This shift indicates a growing investor appetite for diversification beyond just Bitcoin, recognizing Ethereum’s unique value proposition. While Balchunas maintains his prediction that Ethereum will not surpass 20% of the total crypto ETF AUM, citing the inevitable emergence of more competitors as other crypto-related ETFs gain regulatory approval, the current momentum for Ethereum ETFs is undeniable and powerful. This indicates a maturing market where investors are seeking broader exposure to the digital asset ecosystem. What’s Driving the Astonishing Surge in Ethereum ETFs ? The impressive ascent of Ethereum ETFs isn’t accidental; it’s a culmination of several key factors that make Ethereum a compelling investment. Understanding these drivers is crucial for grasping the broader implications for the crypto market: Ethereum’s Foundational Utility: Unlike Bitcoin, which is primarily a store of value, Ethereum serves as the backbone for a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), including decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and Web3 initiatives. This utility makes Ethereum more than just a digital currency; it’s a programmable blockchain that underpins innovation. Regulatory Clarity and Institutional Acceptance: The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs paved the way, signaling a growing acceptance of crypto-backed financial products by regulatory bodies. This precedent has instilled greater confidence in institutions and traditional investors regarding the viability and legitimacy of Ethereum ETFs . Enhanced Accessibility for Traditional Investors: ETFs offer a familiar and regulated investment vehicle, allowing individuals and institutions to gain exposure to Ethereum without the complexities of direct crypto ownership, such as setting up wallets or managing private keys. This ease of access significantly broadens the investor base. Diversification Benefits: As the crypto market matures, investors are increasingly looking for diversification beyond just Bitcoin. Ethereum, with its distinct use cases and market dynamics, offers an attractive alternative to balance a crypto portfolio. Anticipation of Future Upgrades: Ethereum’s continuous development, including upcoming upgrades focused on scalability, efficiency, and security (like the Dencun and Pectra upgrades), fuels optimism about its long-term potential and intrinsic value. These combined factors create a powerful tailwind for Ethereum ETFs , positioning them as a critical component in the evolving digital asset investment landscape. How Do Ethereum ETFs Compare to Bitcoin ETFs? While both Ethereum ETFs and Bitcoin ETFs offer investors regulated exposure to cryptocurrencies, their underlying assets and market dynamics present interesting distinctions. Understanding these differences helps in appreciating the current market shifts: Market Dominance: Historically, Bitcoin has held an overwhelming share of the crypto market, reflected in its ETF AUM. However, as Eric Balchunas pointed out, Ethereum ETFs are now actively chipping away at this dominance, indicating a more diversified interest from investors. Use Cases: Bitcoin is often seen as ‘digital gold’ – a store of value and a hedge against inflation. Ethereum, on the other hand, is a platform for innovation. Its smart contract capabilities enable a vast array of decentralized applications, giving it a different value proposition and growth potential linked to the adoption of Web3 technologies. Network Activity: Ethereum’s network typically sees higher transaction volumes and fees due to its role in DeFi, NFTs, and other dApps. This active ecosystem can be a draw for investors looking for exposure to a highly utilized blockchain. Investment Thesis: Investing in a Bitcoin ETF often aligns with a belief in its role as a digital store of value. Investing in an Ethereum ETF often aligns with a belief in the future of decentralized applications, smart contracts, and the broader Web3 economy. The current trend suggests that investors are not necessarily abandoning Bitcoin, but rather expanding their horizons to include Ethereum, recognizing its distinct and growing importance in the digital economy. This signals a maturation of the crypto investment space, moving beyond a singular focus. What Are the Benefits of Investing in Ethereum ETFs ? For many investors, Ethereum ETFs represent an attractive pathway into the world of digital assets, offering several compelling advantages: Accessibility: ETFs trade on traditional stock exchanges, making them easily accessible through standard brokerage accounts. This eliminates the need for investors to navigate complex crypto exchanges, understand wallet security, or manage private keys. Regulatory Oversight: Being regulated financial products, Ethereum ETFs offer a layer of investor protection and transparency that might not be present when buying Ethereum directly from unregulated platforms. This oversight can reduce concerns about fraud or market manipulation. Diversification: For those already invested in traditional assets, adding Ethereum ETFs can provide portfolio diversification. For crypto investors, it offers a way to diversify beyond Bitcoin within the digital asset class. Liquidity: ETFs are generally highly liquid, meaning they can be bought and sold easily throughout the trading day at market prices. This contrasts with some direct crypto holdings, which might experience wider bid-ask spreads or less consistent liquidity on certain exchanges. Professional Management: ETF providers handle the complexities of holding and securing the underlying Ethereum, including custody solutions and rebalancing. This passive investment approach appeals to those who prefer hands-off management. These benefits collectively make Ethereum ETFs a strong contender for investors looking to gain exposure to the rapidly expanding Ethereum ecosystem with greater ease and security. Navigating the Challenges and Risks of Ethereum ETFs While the benefits of Ethereum ETFs are clear, it’s equally important for investors to be aware of the inherent challenges and risks. No investment is without its downsides, and digital assets, even within an ETF wrapper, carry unique considerations: Market Volatility: Ethereum, like all cryptocurrencies, is subject to significant price volatility. While ETFs provide a regulated structure, they do not eliminate the underlying asset’s price fluctuations. Investors must be prepared for potential rapid gains or losses. Regulatory Uncertainty: Although Ethereum ETFs have gained approval in some jurisdictions, the global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Changes in regulations could impact the value or availability of these products. Competition: As Balchunas noted, the success of Ethereum ETFs is likely to spur the approval of other crypto-related ETFs. Increased competition from new digital asset ETFs could dilute market interest and AUM for existing products. Fees and Expenses: Like all ETFs, Ethereum ETFs come with management fees (expense ratios) that can eat into returns over time. While often lower than actively managed funds, these fees are a consideration compared to direct crypto ownership. Tracking Error: While ETFs aim to closely track the performance of their underlying asset, minor deviations (tracking errors) can occur due to various factors like fees, liquidity, or rebalancing strategies. A thorough understanding of these risks is essential for making informed investment decisions and ensuring that Ethereum ETFs align with your individual risk tolerance and financial goals. Actionable Insights for Your Ethereum ETF Strategy Considering the rise of Ethereum ETFs , what should investors do? Here are some actionable insights to help you navigate this evolving landscape: Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Before investing in any crypto-related product, understand that volatility is inherent. Only allocate capital you are comfortable losing. Research Thoroughly: Don’t just follow the hype. Understand Ethereum’s technology, its use cases, and its long-term vision. Research the specific Ethereum ETF you are considering, including its expense ratio, holdings, and provider reputation. Consider Diversification: While Ethereum ETFs offer diversification within crypto, consider how they fit into your overall investment portfolio. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Stay Informed on Regulatory Developments: The regulatory environment for crypto is dynamic. Keep an eye on news regarding new approvals, potential restrictions, or changes in how digital assets are classified. Long-Term Perspective: Given the nascent stage of crypto ETFs and the inherent volatility of the underlying assets, adopting a long-term investment horizon can help weather short-term fluctuations. By applying these insights, investors can make more strategic and informed decisions regarding their exposure to Ethereum ETFs and the broader crypto market. Conclusion: The Dawn of a Diversified Crypto Investment Era The surge of Ethereum ETFs marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of cryptocurrency investments. It’s a clear signal that the market is maturing beyond a singular focus on Bitcoin, embracing the diverse potential offered by other foundational digital assets like Ethereum. While Bitcoin retains its significant position, the growing appetite for Ethereum ETFs underscores a broader acceptance of crypto as a legitimate asset class, one that offers various avenues for exposure. Eric Balchunas’s insights provide a valuable snapshot of this shift, highlighting not just Ethereum’s impressive growth but also the anticipation of a more competitive ETF landscape. For investors, this means more choices, greater accessibility, and the opportunity to participate in the burgeoning decentralized economy through regulated and familiar financial products. The future of crypto investment appears increasingly diversified, dynamic, and accessible, with Ethereum ETFs playing an undeniably central role in this exciting new chapter. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is an Ethereum ETF ? An Ethereum ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) is an investment fund that holds Ethereum as its underlying asset and trades on traditional stock exchanges. It allows investors to gain exposure to Ethereum’s price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency. Q2: How do Ethereum ETFs impact Bitcoin’s market share? As highlighted by analyst Eric Balchunas, the rising inflows into Ethereum ETFs are drawing investment capital that was previously concentrated in Bitcoin ETFs. This results in a reduction of Bitcoin’s percentage share of the total crypto ETF assets under management, as investors diversify their crypto holdings. Q3: Are Ethereum ETFs regulated? Yes, Ethereum ETFs , once approved, operate under the regulatory framework of the jurisdictions in which they are launched. This provides a level of oversight and investor protection not always present with direct cryptocurrency purchases on unregulated exchanges. Q4: What are the main benefits of investing in Ethereum ETFs over direct Ethereum ownership? Key benefits include ease of access through traditional brokerage accounts, regulatory oversight, professional custody of the underlying assets, and liquidity on stock exchanges, avoiding the complexities of self-custody and managing private keys. Q5: Will Ethereum ETFs surpass Bitcoin ETFs in market dominance? While Ethereum ETFs are gaining significant market share, analyst Eric Balchunas predicts they are unlikely to surpass 20% of total crypto ETF AUM due to the anticipated approval of more diverse crypto-related ETFs, which will introduce new competitors into the market. Q6: What are the risks associated with Ethereum ETFs ? The primary risks include the high price volatility of Ethereum itself, ongoing regulatory uncertainties in the broader crypto market, the potential for tracking errors between the ETF and the underlying asset, and management fees.

2025-07-29T16:37:33,"Crypto Has a Comms Issue","Earlier this month, NPR ran a headline, “Why there's so much excitement around a cryptocurrency called stablecoin.” If you want to understand where crypto stands with legacy media in 2025, start there. The piece was a basic primer on a decade-old innovation that settles nearly $27 trillion annually, surpassing the combined annual transaction volume of Visa and Mastercard. Stablecoins are not new, and neither is the media’s incuriosity about them. It was the most recent proofpoint that in the eyes of legacy media, crypto remains suspended in a state of perpetual novelty. The gap between crypto’s market performance and the stories told about it reveals a deeper communications failure. It keeps the public in the dark about transformative advances in a $4 trillion industry. Today, Bitcoin is up over 110% year-to-date. U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETFs have attracted over $50 billion in net inflows, marking one of the most successful ETF launches in history. Global crypto adoption has surpassed 600 million users, with countries like Turkey, Argentina, and the UAE reporting that nearly one in three adults own crypto. Consumer products are also taking off. Decentralized prediction market Polymarket has seen over $100 million in volume on the 2024 U.S. election alone, and is reportedly on track for a $1 billion valuation. Beneath the surface, on-chain rails are quietly powering a new global financial infrastructure. However, mainstream media narratives have failed to keep up. According to a report by Perception, while Bitcoin posted record performance in Q2 2024, The Wall Street Journal published just two articles on Bitcoin and crypto. The Financial Times and The New York Times, respectively managed only eleven, compared to 141 by CNBC and 65 by Barron’s. This lack of coverage in top financial outlets means that one of the most important financial and technological innovations of our time is not reaching investors, policymakers, and the public. The gap between market signals and coverage in crypto is an existential liability and has dire political, regulatory and cultural consequences. For many Americans, crypto is still a spectacle – seen as volatile, unserious and untrustworthy. Legislation is based as much on perception as it is on principle. Markets respond to narratives as much as numbers, and voters form opinions through headlines. This isn’t just a branding problem, but a structural issue rooted in how Bitcoin and crypto has let the world tell its story – and often, get it wrong. The industry did not just lose public trust during the last cycle. It lost the plot. In pursuing mass appeal, the industry opted for spectacle over substance: with stadium naming rights, Super Bowl ads, and celebrity campaigns. It borrowed legitimacy, rather than cultivating its own. When FTX, BlockFi, and Celsius imploded, the public had no coherent story to fall back on. Today, Bitcoin’s success is grounded in real market signals – not projections, ideals, or hypotheticals. The data shows that crypto is flourishing. Like any serious asset class, its credibility is proven by the numbers. The role of crypto communications now is not to spin a story, but to use and interpret the one that the market is already telling. The obstacles to clearer coverage are persistent. Stories highlighting “Presidential” meme coins cast the technology as a political toy. Bitcoin and crypto’s involvement in the 2024 election further embedded it in partisan culture wars and cast it as a partisan talking point with mainstream media. Like the internet, Bitcoin has no ideology or politics. Its origins proposed a system built not on trust, but on math, code, and consensus. It emerged post-financial crisis, when confidence in central institutions was shaken but intact. Gradually, the 2016 election, the pandemic, and heightened focus on wealth inequality deepened public skepticism. Into that erosion, Bitcoin proposed an alternative: a system built not on trust but on the values of the internet and modern ideals of self-determination, global access and direct ownership. Crypto is established and legitimate enough to tell its own story. It doesn’t need a rebrand or more flash. It needs facts grounded in what the market has already shown to be true. This will not be the work of a single campaign or stakeholder. It requires the long and dedicated work of narrative stewardship by builders, users, and communicators that can own and execute on telling our own stories. If we don’t, others will. And they will keep getting it wrong.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/07/29/crypto-has-a-comms-issue,"BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY","Opinion|Opinion",cryptocompare

2025-07-29T16:30:11,"Unlocking Cardano’s Astounding Potential: Why ADA Could Outpace Bitcoin 1,000x","BitcoinWorld Unlocking Cardano’s Astounding Potential: Why ADA Could Outpace Bitcoin 1,000x In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, bold predictions are common, but few resonate as strongly as those from industry pioneers. Recently, Charles Hoskinson, the visionary founder of Cardano (ADA), made a statement that has sent ripples across the crypto community: he believes ADA’s unit price could appreciate an astonishing 1,000 times, a feat he suggests is beyond Bitcoin’s reach. This declaration, as reported by The Crypto Basic, not only highlights Hoskinson’s conviction in his creation but also reignites the long-standing debate about the future leadership of the blockchain space. This profound belief in Cardano potential comes amidst his recent criticism of suggestions to convert the ADA treasury into Bitcoin, underscoring a fundamental divergence in philosophy and strategic direction. Decoding Charles Hoskinson’s Vision for Cardano Potential Charles Hoskinson isn’t one to shy away from controversial opinions, and his latest comments are no exception. His assertion that Cardano could achieve a 1,000x price appreciation while Bitcoin cannot is rooted in his deep understanding of blockchain technology and market dynamics. For many, Bitcoin, the progenitor of cryptocurrencies, represents digital gold – a store of value. Its design prioritizes security and decentralization above all else, leading to a relatively fixed supply and a robust, albeit less flexible, network. Hoskinson’s perspective on Cardano potential, however, is dramatically different. He envisions Cardano not merely as a digital asset, but as a foundational platform for a new global financial and social operating system. This distinction is crucial: Bitcoin’s Role: Primarily a store of value and a medium of exchange, designed for scarcity and censorship resistance. Its fixed supply and proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism contribute to its robust security but also limit its scalability and flexibility for complex applications. Cardano’s Ambition: Aims to be a programmable blockchain platform, supporting smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and complex financial instruments. Its proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, Ouroboros, is designed for scalability, sustainability, and energy efficiency, offering a different paradigm for growth. The 1,000x prediction for Cardano potential isn’t just a number; it reflects a belief in ADA’s capacity to absorb significant global value by becoming an indispensable infrastructure layer for various industries, from finance and supply chain to identity management and governance. Why Does Charles Hoskinson See Such Immense Cardano Potential? The core of Hoskinson’s argument for Cardano’s exponential growth lies in its unique architecture and development philosophy. Unlike many other blockchains that prioritize speed to market, Cardano has adopted a research-driven, peer-reviewed approach, emphasizing security, scalability, and sustainability from the ground up. Here are some key differentiators that fuel his optimism regarding Cardano potential: Scientific Rigor and Peer Review: Every major development on Cardano undergoes rigorous academic peer review, ensuring a robust and secure foundation. This methodical approach minimizes vulnerabilities and builds a highly reliable network. Proof-of-Stake (PoS) & Ouroboros: Cardano’s Ouroboros PoS protocol is significantly more energy-efficient and scalable than Bitcoin’s PoW. This allows for higher transaction throughput and lower fees, crucial for widespread adoption. Layered Architecture: Cardano employs a layered architecture, separating the settlement layer (for transactions) from the computation layer (for smart contracts). This design enhances flexibility, scalability, and allows for future upgrades without disrupting the entire network. Smart Contract Capabilities: With the Alonzo hard fork, Cardano gained full smart contract functionality, opening doors for a vast ecosystem of DeFi applications, NFTs, and more. This programmable nature is a fundamental difference from Bitcoin. Interoperability: Cardano is designed with interoperability in mind, aiming to connect with other blockchains and traditional financial systems, facilitating seamless value transfer and data exchange across disparate networks. Treasury System and Governance: Cardano features an on-chain treasury system funded by transaction fees, governed by the community through Project Catalyst. This decentralized funding mechanism supports ongoing development and innovation, ensuring the network’s long-term sustainability and growth. These architectural choices, according to Hoskinson, provide Cardano with a superior foundation to scale and integrate into the global economy in ways that Bitcoin, by its very design, cannot. This foundational strength is what underpins the belief in such massive Cardano potential. Comparing Giants: Cardano vs. Bitcoin – A Fundamental Divide While Bitcoin remains the undisputed king in terms of market capitalization and recognition, its inherent design choices present limitations when compared to a platform like Cardano, especially concerning future scalability and application development. Understanding these differences is key to appreciating Hoskinson’s stance on Cardano potential. Feature Bitcoin (BTC) Cardano (ADA) Primary Function Digital gold, store of value, medium of exchange Programmable blockchain platform, dApp host, smart contracts, store of value Consensus Mechanism Proof-of-Work (PoW) Proof-of-Stake (PoS) – Ouroboros Energy Consumption High Extremely Low Scalability Limited (approx. 7 transactions/sec) High (designed for thousands of transactions/sec with Hydra) Smart Contracts Limited/Non-native (via secondary layers) Native and fully functional (Plutus platform) Development Philosophy Conservative, focus on security and decentralization Research-driven, peer-reviewed, formal methods Governance Off-chain, informal consensus On-chain treasury and decentralized governance (Project Catalyst) Bitcoin’s strength lies in its simplicity and unyielding security, making it a reliable hedge against inflation and a foundational asset. However, its lack of native smart contract capabilities and lower transaction throughput means it cannot directly host the complex decentralized applications that are defining the next era of the internet. Cardano, conversely, is built to be a foundational layer for these applications, which, if successful, could unlock immense value and justify the ambitious Cardano potential. The Path to 1,000x: What Does it Entail for Cardano? Achieving a 1,000x appreciation for ADA is a monumental task, even for a project with Cardano’s technological prowess. It implies a market capitalization that would dwarf most traditional assets. This level of growth hinges on several critical factors that would collectively unlock its full Cardano potential: Mass Adoption of dApps and DeFi: For Cardano to truly scale, its ecosystem must flourish with a wide array of innovative and user-friendly decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols that attract millions of users and billions in total value locked (TVL). Enterprise and Institutional Integration: Significant partnerships with large corporations, governments, and financial institutions would bring massive capital and real-world utility to the network. Cardano’s focus on regulatory compliance and formal verification makes it attractive for such integrations. Scalability Solutions (e.g., Hydra): The successful implementation and widespread adoption of scaling solutions like Hydra will be crucial. Hydra is designed to allow thousands of transactions per second, transforming Cardano into a high-throughput network capable of handling global demand. Global Identity and Digital Public Infrastructure: Cardano’s work on decentralized identity solutions (Atala PRISM) and its efforts in developing digital public infrastructure for nations (e.g., in Africa) could onboard vast populations and create foundational value. Sustained Developer Activity: A vibrant and growing developer community is essential for continuous innovation and the creation of new use cases that drive demand for ADA. Favorable Regulatory Environment: Clear and supportive regulatory frameworks worldwide would reduce uncertainty, encourage investment, and facilitate mainstream adoption. Each of these elements must align and execute successfully for Cardano to realize the kind of explosive growth Hoskinson envisions. The journey is long and complex, but the underlying technological foundation for unlocking Cardano potential is already being laid. Navigating the Road Ahead: Challenges and Considerations for Cardano’s Potential While the vision for Cardano potential is compelling, it’s crucial to acknowledge the significant hurdles that lie on its path to a 1,000x valuation. No project is without its challenges, and a realistic assessment requires considering these factors: Market Volatility and Competition: The crypto market is notoriously volatile, and Cardano operates in a highly competitive landscape with numerous other Layer 1 blockchains (Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, Polkadot, etc.) vying for market share and developer talent. Execution Risk: Cardano’s methodical, research-first approach can sometimes lead to slower development cycles compared to competitors. Delivering on ambitious roadmaps, like Hydra, on time and effectively is critical. Regulatory Uncertainty: The global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Unfavorable regulations could stifle innovation or adoption, impacting Cardano’s growth trajectory. Network Effect and User Adoption: While technologically sound, building a strong network effect and onboarding a critical mass of users and developers takes time and significant effort. Existing networks like Ethereum have a substantial head start. Public Perception and FUD: Like any prominent crypto project, Cardano is subject to intense scrutiny, misinformation, and FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt), which can impact market sentiment. Overcoming these challenges will require not only continued technological excellence but also robust community engagement, strategic partnerships, and effective communication from the Cardano Foundation and IOG (Input Output Global). Is Cardano a Smart Investment? Actionable Insights for the Future For investors intrigued by the prospect of immense Cardano potential, a balanced approach is key. Hoskinson’s 1,000x prediction, while inspiring, should be viewed within the context of high-risk, high-reward crypto investments. Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand Cardano’s technology, its roadmap, its community, and the problems it aims to solve. Don’t rely solely on price predictions. Consider Long-Term Holding: If Cardano is to achieve anything close to a 1,000x return, it will likely be over a significant time horizon (years, if not a decade). Short-term trading based on such predictions is extremely risky. Diversify Your Portfolio: Never put all your capital into a single asset, no matter how promising it seems. Diversification helps mitigate risk. Stay Informed: Keep up with Cardano’s development updates, ecosystem growth, and broader market trends. Follow official channels and reputable news sources. Understand Risk Tolerance: Only invest what you can afford to lose. The crypto market is highly volatile, and significant price swings are common. The vision for Cardano potential is compelling, driven by a commitment to robust engineering and a long-term strategy for global impact. Whether it reaches the lofty 1,000x target remains to be seen, but its journey continues to be one of the most fascinating narratives in the blockchain space. Conclusion: The Audacious Dream of Cardano Potential Charles Hoskinson’s assertion that Cardano could achieve a 1,000x price increase while Bitcoin cannot is more than just a bold forecast; it’s a declaration of a fundamentally different philosophy for the future of decentralized technology. It underscores a belief that true value will be created not just by digital scarcity, but by highly functional, scalable, and sustainable platforms that can host the next generation of global applications. While Bitcoin continues to solidify its position as digital gold, Cardano aims to be the digital infrastructure, building a complex ecosystem that could potentially unlock unprecedented levels of utility and value. The journey to realize such immense Cardano potential is fraught with challenges, yet the foundational work, the vibrant community, and the ambitious roadmap suggest that ADA remains a project with extraordinary long-term aspirations in the evolving digital economy.

2025-07-29T16:30:07,"This Week In Bitcoin: 4 Things To Keep An Eye On That Could Impact Price","As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to trade in a volatile yet increasingly bullish market , a crypto analyst points to key developments that could drive a breakout past $130,000 . From macroeconomic shifts to major technical breakouts and unexpected geopolitical tailwinds, the analyst outlines four critical factors to watch this week that could significantly impact BTC’s price action. The Trump-EU Trade Deal On July 27, crypto analyst Doctor Profit posted a detailed macro report on X social media, highlighting Bitcoin and certain bullish events unfolding around it. Before addressing the latest US trade developments , the market expert noted that Bitcoin recently pulled off a major technical move that went largely unnoticed by the market. After facing four consecutive months of rejection from November 2024 to February 2025, BTC finally broke through a long-term diagonal resistance tied to its 2021 all-time high . It then retested the level as support and followed through with a strong bullish move. On the macro front, Doctor Pillows suggested that a significant shift in the global trade policy could fuel Bitcoin’s continued upward momentum. He highlighted President Donald Trump’s announcement of a landmark trade agreement between the US and European Union, easing fears of a potential tariff war . The analyst described this deal as one of the most bullish trade agreements since 2016, noting that markets are likely to respond positively to the reduced geopolitical risks . With stocks set to open higher and economic friction easing between two of the world’s largest economies, Bitcoin also stands to benefit from the improved macro environment . Whale Panic Vs. ETF Power Earlier this week, Bitcoin saw a brief drop to $114,500 after wallet activity from Galaxy Digital sparked concerns of a potential selloff. However, according to Doctor Profit, those fears quickly faded as spot ETF inflows continued to outpace Bitcoin’s daily issuance. Institutions like BlackRock are also steadily absorbing supply, reinforcing strong underlying demand. Most importantly, the analyst highlighted that many long-term whale wallets remain inactive, indicating that the broader accumulation trend is still intact. Rather than signaling weakness, Doctor Profit suggests that the recent price dip appeared to have been a temporary shakeout that highlights the strength of the ongoing bull market . M2 Money Supply Sees Increase In his report, Doctor Profit stated that Bitcoin’s real macro engine is emerging from M2 Money Supply growth. Despite ongoing narratives around quantitative tightening, the analyst highlights that M2 has risen by 2.3% in 2025 so far, including a sharp 0.63% spike between May and June— the largest monthly increase this year. Historically, Bitcoin has closely followed M2 expansion , as seen during the 2020 liquidity surge that fueled an 800% rally. While exact outcomes vary, Doctor Profit suggests that the current pace of growth points to a potential 15-17.5% BTC rally to above $130,000 in the coming weeks, based on the cryptocurrency’s typical 60-90 day lag in reacting to monetary expansion. FOMC Meeting And Potential Rate Cut As his final bullish point, Doctor Profit mentioned the next FOMC meeting on Wednesday. While the official stance remains “hawkish,” with only a 5% chance of a rate cut, the analyst noted that the Federal Reserve (FED) has been quietly expanding liquidity and printing. This growing disconnect between Chair Jerome Powell ’s rhetoric and the FED’s actual monetary actions is noteworthy. It suggests that the FED may already be laying the groundwork for the next round of quantitative easing. Given Bitcoin’s historical sensitivity to monetary policy shifts , the cryptocurrency may be well-positioned to rally significantly once the pivot becomes more apparent.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/this-week-in-bitcoin/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX|COMMODITY|ONDO|ENA|GALA","Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|BlackRock|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Doctor Pillows|Doctor Profit|Donald Trump|Fed|Federal Reserve|FOMC meeting|Galaxy Digital|Global M2 Money Supply|Jerome Powell",cryptocompare

The intricate dance between the world’s two largest economies directly influences investor sentiment, capital flows, and the overall risk appetite that often dictates the ebb and flow of the crypto market. Let’s delve into what this extension truly means and why it’s a critical piece of the global economic puzzle. Understanding the Extended US China Trade Truce The concept of a ‘trade truce’ might sound like a temporary pause in hostilities, and in many ways, it is. It signifies an agreement between the United States and China to refrain from escalating tariffs or imposing new trade restrictions, at least for a defined period. This latest extension is a continuation of previous agreements, designed to provide a much-needed period of predictability and calm after years of tit-for-tat tariffs and trade disputes that began in 2018. The initial trade tensions stemmed from various issues, including intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers, and massive trade imbalances. These disputes led to billions of dollars in tariffs on goods exchanged between the two nations, impacting supply chains, consumer prices, and corporate profits globally. The truce, therefore, is not a resolution of these deep-seated issues but rather a strategic decision by both superpowers to de-escalate and create space for ongoing dialogue. The confirmation of this extension, as reported by Walter Bloomberg, provides official acknowledgment of this continued commitment. It suggests that despite persistent geopolitical rivalries and economic competition, both Washington and Beijing recognize the mutual benefits of maintaining open, if cautious, lines of communication and trade, preventing further disruption to an already fragile global economy. The extension of the US China trade truce brings a renewed sense of stability to global markets. US China Trade Truce: Crucial Extension Signals Global Stability Why is this US China Trade Truce So Significant for Global Markets? The relationship between the U.S. and China is arguably the most consequential bilateral relationship in the world, influencing everything from manufacturing and technology to finance and commodity prices. An extended US China trade truce sends powerful signals across various sectors: Reduced Uncertainty: Businesses thrive on predictability. The truce removes the immediate threat of new tariffs, allowing companies to plan investments, manage supply chains, and make hiring decisions with greater confidence. This stability is particularly crucial for multinational corporations heavily reliant on both Chinese production and American consumption. Boost to Global Trade: While not a full trade agreement, the truce prevents a further contraction of global trade volumes. This is beneficial for shipping, logistics, and manufacturing industries worldwide, as goods can flow more freely without punitive tariffs. Commodity Market Stability: Major commodity prices, from oil to agricultural products, are often sensitive to US-China relations. A truce typically reduces price volatility, which is good news for economies reliant on these exports and for consumers. Investor Confidence: When geopolitical tensions ease, investors tend to shift from ‘risk-off’ assets (like gold or certain government bonds) to ‘risk-on’ assets (like equities and, increasingly, cryptocurrencies). This renewed confidence can fuel market rallies and attract new capital. To illustrate the shift, consider the impact of previous phases: Phase Key Characteristics Market Impact Trade War Escalation (2018-2019) Imposition of widespread tariffs, tit-for-tat responses, heightened rhetoric. Increased market volatility, supply chain disruptions, investor uncertainty, decline in global trade. Phase One Deal (2020) Partial agreement, China committed to purchasing more US goods, some tariff reductions. Temporary market relief, improved sentiment, partial recovery in trade volumes. Current Truce Extension Continuation of de-escalation, commitment to ongoing dialogue, avoidance of new tariffs. Sustained market stability, reduced geopolitical risk premium, potential for ‘risk-on’ capital flows. Navigating the Challenges and Opportunities of the Extended US China Trade Truce While the extension of the US China trade truce is a welcome development, it’s important to acknowledge that it doesn’t resolve all underlying issues. Challenges persist, but so do opportunities for strategic positioning: Lingering Challenges: Structural Issues: Deep-seated disagreements over intellectual property rights, state subsidies, and market access remain. These are complex issues that require long-term negotiations. Technological Competition: The race for technological supremacy, particularly in areas like AI, semiconductors, and 5G, continues to be a source of tension. The truce doesn’t necessarily halt efforts by either side to gain an edge. Geopolitical Rivalries: Beyond trade, geopolitical friction in areas like Taiwan, the South China Sea, and human rights can quickly sour relations and impact the trade environment. Emerging Opportunities: Renewed Dialogue: The truce provides a window for both nations to engage in constructive dialogue on broader economic and strategic issues, potentially paving the way for more comprehensive agreements in the future. Supply Chain Resilience: Companies can use this period of calm to diversify supply chains and build greater resilience, reducing over-reliance on any single region. Sector-Specific Growth: Industries that were heavily impacted by tariffs, such as agriculture or specific manufacturing sectors, may see a rebound in trade and investment. What Does the US China Trade Truce Mean for Cryptocurrency? The impact of the extended US China trade truce on the cryptocurrency market is multifaceted and largely positive. Here’s how it breaks down: Enhanced Risk Appetite: When traditional financial markets experience stability and reduced geopolitical risk, investors often feel more confident allocating capital to higher-risk, higher-reward assets like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, often seen as a barometer for market sentiment, could benefit from this renewed optimism. Reduced Volatility in Traditional Markets: A calmer global trade environment generally translates to less volatility in stock markets and other traditional assets. This can create a more stable backdrop for crypto, as extreme swings in traditional finance often spill over into the digital asset space. Institutional Confidence: Large institutional investors and corporations are more likely to enter or expand their presence in the crypto market when macroeconomic conditions are stable. Reduced trade tensions contribute to this sense of stability, potentially attracting more institutional capital into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major cryptocurrencies. Global Economic Growth: A more stable US-China trade relationship supports global economic growth. As economies expand, disposable income may increase, and innovation thrives, potentially leading to greater adoption and utility for various blockchain technologies and digital currencies. Impact on Stablecoins and CBDCs: While not directly tied to the truce, the broader economic relationship between the US and China influences discussions around digital currencies, including stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). A period of cooperation, even if limited, could subtly shape the global regulatory landscape for digital assets. For investors, this truce offers a window of opportunity. It’s a signal to perhaps re-evaluate portfolios, consider assets that perform well in ‘risk-on’ environments, and stay informed about ongoing geopolitical developments. While crypto markets have their own unique drivers, they are not immune to the gravitational pull of global macroeconomic forces. The current truce could foster a more conducive environment for innovation and growth within the digital asset ecosystem. A Compelling Path Forward The extension of the US China trade truce is a testament to the complex and interdependent nature of the global economy. It reflects a pragmatic approach from both sides, prioritizing stability over immediate confrontation. While it’s not a panacea for all economic challenges, it provides a crucial breathing room that benefits businesses, consumers, and investors alike. For the cryptocurrency world, this development underscores the increasing interconnectedness of digital assets with traditional finance and global politics. A more stable world economy generally translates to a more confident investor base, which can only be good news for the long-term growth and adoption of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. As we move forward, vigilance remains key, but for now, the extended truce offers a compelling path toward greater global economic predictability.

2025-07-29T16:20:10,"Revolutionizing Crypto Mortgages: Lummis’ Bold Bill Unlocks New Homeownership Pathways","BitcoinWorld Revolutionizing Crypto Mortgages: Lummis’ Bold Bill Unlocks New Homeownership Pathways Imagine a world where your digital assets, your cryptocurrency holdings, could open the door to homeownership. This isn’t a futuristic fantasy anymore. A significant legislative push is underway in the United States that could fundamentally reshape how financial institutions view your digital wealth when you apply for a home loan. U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced a groundbreaking bill that aims to require lenders to consider applicants’ cryptocurrency holdings as a legitimate factor in mortgage loan approvals. This move has the potential to revolutionize crypto mortgages and democratize access to the housing market for millions of crypto enthusiasts. Understanding the Proposed Legislation on Crypto Mortgages At its core, Senator Lummis’ bill seeks to modernize the traditional mortgage lending framework by integrating digital assets into the financial assessment process. Currently, most financial institutions primarily focus on traditional income sources, credit scores, and conventional assets when evaluating mortgage applications. The proposed legislation challenges this long-standing practice, aiming to provide a clearer path for individuals who have accumulated significant wealth in cryptocurrencies but might not fit the conventional borrower profile. According to reports, including those by Watcher Guru via X, the bill’s intent is clear: to ensure that crypto holdings are not just acknowledged but are actively factored into an applicant’s financial standing. This means: Broader Asset Recognition: Lenders would be mandated to consider a broader spectrum of assets, moving beyond just fiat currency and traditional investments. Increased Accessibility: It could significantly increase the pool of eligible homebuyers, especially younger generations who have invested heavily in digital assets. Regulatory Clarity: The bill aims to provide much-needed regulatory clarity for financial institutions, guiding them on how to assess and value volatile digital assets for loan purposes. This initiative represents a pivotal moment, bridging the gap between the rapidly evolving digital economy and the historically conservative traditional financial system. Why Now? The Growing Need for Crypto Mortgages The timing of Senator Lummis’ bill is no coincidence. The cryptocurrency market has matured significantly over the past decade, with millions of Americans now holding substantial portions of their wealth in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital currencies. However, despite this growth, these assets have largely remained on the sidelines when it comes to major financial transactions like home purchases. The current landscape presents a paradox: Many individuals possess substantial wealth in crypto. Traditional lenders often do not recognize this wealth adequately for mortgage qualification. This creates a barrier to entry for potential homeowners, forcing them to liquidate their crypto holdings, often incurring significant tax events or missing out on potential gains. Senator Lummis, a known advocate for cryptocurrency, recognizes this disconnect. Her bill seeks to address this by acknowledging the legitimacy of crypto as a form of wealth, thereby aligning financial regulations with the realities of modern investment portfolios. This legislative push is a testament to the growing influence of digital assets in mainstream finance. Potential Benefits of Adopting Crypto Mortgages The implications of this bill, if passed, are far-reaching, promising a host of benefits for both consumers and the broader financial ecosystem. Let’s explore some of the key advantages: For Homebuyers: Unlocking New Opportunities For individuals holding significant crypto assets, this bill could be a game-changer. It offers: Diversified Asset Utilization: Homebuyers could potentially use their crypto holdings without needing to convert them to fiat, avoiding potential capital gains taxes or unfavorable market timing. Increased Purchasing Power: For those with substantial unrealized gains in crypto, this could unlock significant purchasing power for larger homes or entry into more competitive markets. Financial Inclusion: It could provide pathways to homeownership for individuals who might not have traditional employment histories or substantial fiat savings but are rich in digital assets. For Financial Institutions: Expanding the Market While seemingly a challenge, this legislation also presents opportunities for lenders: New Customer Segment: Tapping into the rapidly growing crypto-rich demographic. Innovation in Lending: Encouraging financial institutions to develop innovative products and risk assessment models tailored to digital assets. Competitive Edge: Early adopters could gain a significant competitive advantage in a new market segment. For the Crypto Industry: Mainstream Validation The bill would further legitimize cryptocurrency as a mainstream asset class, fostering greater institutional adoption and public trust. It moves crypto from speculative investment to a tangible asset capable of supporting major life purchases. What Are the Challenges and Considerations for Crypto Mortgages ? While the prospect of crypto-backed mortgages is exciting, it’s crucial to acknowledge the inherent challenges and complexities that would need to be addressed. The primary concern revolves around the volatility of cryptocurrency markets. Consider these key challenges: Challenge Area Description Potential Mitigation Price Volatility Cryptocurrency prices can fluctuate dramatically in short periods, posing a risk to collateral value. Over-collateralization, dynamic loan-to-value ratios, stablecoin-backed loans, or specific crypto asset eligibility. Valuation & Liquidation Accurately valuing diverse crypto assets and ensuring their efficient liquidation in case of default. Standardized valuation methodologies, partnerships with crypto exchanges, clear liquidation protocols. Regulatory Framework Lack of comprehensive federal regulations for digital assets could create legal ambiguities for lenders. The bill itself aims to provide a framework; further guidance from regulatory bodies like the SEC and OCC would be needed. Security Risks Concerns about hacks, theft, or loss of private keys. Mandating secure custody solutions, insurance requirements for crypto collateral. Tax Implications Complex tax treatment of crypto assets, especially when used as collateral or liquidated. Clear IRS guidance on crypto-backed loans and collateral. Addressing these challenges will require careful legislative drafting, robust risk management frameworks from financial institutions, and potentially new financial products designed specifically for the digital asset economy. The Road Ahead: What This Means for the Future of Crypto Mortgages Senator Lummis’ bill marks a significant step towards integrating cryptocurrency into mainstream financial products. While the legislative process can be lengthy and complex, the introduction of such a bill signals a growing recognition within Washington of the need to adapt to the evolving financial landscape. If successful, it could set a precedent for how other major assets, both digital and traditional, are viewed in lending. It would encourage financial innovation and force traditional institutions to embrace new technologies and asset classes. For potential homebuyers, this means keeping a close eye on legislative developments. For financial institutions, it’s a call to begin exploring and understanding the nuances of digital assets, preparing for a future where a significant portion of their clientele may hold their wealth in forms previously considered unconventional. Ultimately, the move towards acknowledging crypto in mortgage approvals isn’t just about a single bill; it’s about the ongoing evolution of finance, where digital assets are no longer just a niche investment but a legitimate component of personal wealth and economic activity. The future of homeownership may very well be built on a foundation of both traditional fiat and innovative digital currencies. Conclusion: A New Era for Homeownership? Senator Cynthia Lummis’ proposed legislation to consider cryptocurrency holdings in mortgage loan approvals represents a bold and necessary step towards modernizing the U.S. financial system. By recognizing the growing importance of digital assets, the bill has the potential to unlock new pathways to homeownership, offering greater financial flexibility and inclusion for crypto holders. While challenges like volatility and regulatory clarity remain, the dialogue initiated by this bill is crucial. It signals a future where the lines between traditional finance and the digital economy continue to blur, paving the way for innovative financial products like crypto mortgages that better reflect the diverse wealth portfolios of today’s consumers. This is more than just a legislative proposal; it’s a glimpse into the exciting evolution of how we will finance our lives in the digital age. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is Senator Lummis’ bill regarding cryptocurrency and mortgages? Senator Cynthia Lummis’ proposed legislation aims to require financial institutions to consider applicants’ cryptocurrency holdings as a valid factor when evaluating mortgage loan applications. This would allow crypto assets to be recognized as part of a borrower’s financial standing for home loans. 2. Why is this bill considered significant for crypto mortgages ? This bill is significant because it seeks to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset world. It could enable millions of crypto holders to leverage their digital wealth for major purchases like homes without needing to liquidate their assets, thereby increasing access to homeownership and validating crypto as a legitimate asset class. 3. What are the main benefits for consumers if this bill passes? Consumers could benefit from increased purchasing power, the ability to utilize diversified assets without forced liquidation, and greater financial inclusion. It would open up homeownership opportunities for individuals whose wealth is primarily in cryptocurrencies. 4. What are the primary challenges associated with implementing crypto mortgages ? The main challenges include the inherent price volatility of cryptocurrencies, the complexities of asset valuation and liquidation, the need for a robust regulatory framework, and addressing security risks associated with digital assets. 5. Will this bill make it easier for everyone with crypto to get a mortgage? While the bill aims to make it easier, it’s unlikely to be a blanket solution. Financial institutions would still need to establish clear guidelines for risk assessment, asset valuation, and potentially require over-collateralization or specific types of crypto assets (e.g., stablecoins) to mitigate volatility risks. 6. What is the next step for this proposed legislation? The bill will proceed through the legislative process, which typically involves committee reviews, debates, and votes in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Its passage would depend on bipartisan support and addressing concerns raised by various stakeholders.

2025-07-29T16:12:30,"Hyperliquid traders stuck in their positions as API suffered short outage","The Hyperliquid API is experiencing an outage, not allowing traders to close their positions. The event also means traders cannot close their positions and must wait for the service to return. Trading has stalled on the Hyperliquid perpetual futures DEX, as traders were unable to close their positions. The DEX experienced an outage of its API, meaning traders could not interact with the chain. Based on user reports, the outage persisted between 14:20 and 14:47 UTC. Just before the outage, some of the funding rates on Hyperliquid went negative. Speculations appeared of a coordinated attack or some other form of deliberate outage. During the outage, open positions could not be liquidated, leaving all users stuck with their positions until the issue is resolved. The event happened as Hyperliquid was carrying a record open interest of over $14.7B. The community still awaits a breakdown of the event, as the sudden outage sparked fears of a scenario similar to the inaccessible FTX trading just before the exchange crashed. The API crash also affected the Lighter DEX , which depends on Hyperliquid’s order books. Hyperliquid outage strikes as crypto assets turn the trend Users are reporting outages on both mobile and PC, and are completely locked out of interactions with the protocol. Users on Discord also reported getting error messages, unable to control their DEX accounts. The problem may affect the entire DEX, with no possible orders or actions available for all users. Users reported that even stop losses were impossible, potentially wiping out value from user wallets. getting error messages on hyperliquid on laptop and on mobile. can’t close positions, can’t add margin. can’t cancel orders. can’t establish a connection on mobile i’m freaking out. anyone know what to do? help @HyperliquidX pic.twitter.com/eIQSMCJYHi — kismet (@kismet_wtf) July 29, 2025 Despite the downtime, Hyperchain was operational and continued to produce blocks. Currently, Hyperliquid settles positions on-chain every hour, and it remains to be seen what happens with short and long positions as traders are unable to close them. Potentially, a significant number of positions were at risk of liquidation, causing chaos on the market. The Hyperliquid outage arrived as BTC shifted direction, sinking under $118,000. A downturn would liquidate some of the open positions. Following the news of the outage, HYPE was still trading at $43.69. The asset relies mostly on its native DEX, with no chance to immediately trade or short. The Hyperliquid team has still not explained the nature of the attack. Over 500K accounts were affected While Hyperliquid boasts of being decentralized, the API outage and lack of frontend access meant over 500K accounts may be affected. The short episode raised the issue of depending on a single point of failure, even if the perps DEX settled all trades on-chain. Until Hyperliquid recovered full service, around $538M in net deposited funds were stuck on the exchange, based on DeFi Llama liquidity data . During the outage, one of the most prominent Hyperliquid whales, James Wynn, was caught in another risky long position. Wynn bet on PEPE, expecting the meme token’s recovery. Despite the general Hyperliquid trading outage, the position went through partial liquidations. The PEPE long position carries over $63K in unrealized losses, which were updated during the outage. Wynn was also partially liquidated several times, suggesting other positions may have been affected outside the control of their holders.

2025-07-29T16:10:35,"Bitcoin Faces Pressure as Long-Term Holders Shift to Selling at $118K","Bitcoin’s recent record-setting rally has triggered a notable shift in investor behavior, with long-term holders (LTHs) now offloading their stash, marking a potential inflection point in the market. On-chain data shows that LTHs, who typically hold Bitcoin for more than 155 days, have shed 52,000 BTC since the price reached its latest peak. Long-Term Holders Mirror Previous Distribution Cycles On July 29, analyst Axel Adler Jr. highlighted on X that LTH supply has dropped by 52,000 BTC at the $118,000 level, signaling a decisive shift from accumulation to distribution. “The shift in balance from accumulation to distribution exactly repeats the LTH pattern from fall 2024 when the price rose from $65K to $100K,” Adler noted, suggesting that profit-taking could intensify as prices climb further. This activity has also coincided with mounting pressure on short-term holders (STHs). According to recent analysis by CryptoQuant, wallets holding BTC for one to three months now sit on just 13% unrealized profits, down from 69% earlier in the cycle and a fraction of the 232% and 150% gains seen at the 2012 and 2021 peaks. Adding to the complexity, Matrixport also warned of a potential “tactical pause” for Bitcoin as macro events, including the Federal Reserve’s rate decision and a White House report on digital assets, loom over the market. Historically, August and September have been among Bitcoin’s weakest months, compounding the risk of a near-term pullback despite a broadly bullish outlook for the end of the year. Price Action and Market Sentiment At the time of this writing, BTC was trading at $118,979, up slightly by 0.6% in the last seven days and 10.8% over the past month. It has traded in a tight 24-hour range between $117,498 and $119,026, reflecting waning momentum after a strong mid-July pump. While the asset is still 71% higher year-over-year, it remains 3.2% below its all-time high, and the shift in holder behavior is starting to weigh on sentiment. However, some market watchers remain unfazed. Rekt Capital, for instance, noted on July 28 that Bitcoin’s weekly close above $119,200 had formed a bullish “flag” breakout structure, potentially paving the way for further gains if the level is successfully retested as support. Meanwhile, fellow analyst CrypNeuvo flagged a potential short-term dip toward $114,300 to fill a CME gap before any renewed push higher. If history repeats, this distribution period could provide an entry point for strategic buyers. But with LTH selling accelerating and short-term profits thinning, BTC’s next move hinges on whether it can hold $118,000, or risk a sharper shakeout before its next leg up.

2025-07-29T16:10:11,"Crucial U.S.-China Trade Talks Conclude: A Glimmer of Hope for Global Stability?","BitcoinWorld Crucial U.S.-China Trade Talks Conclude: A Glimmer of Hope for Global Stability? In an ever-interconnected global economy, developments in international relations can send ripples far and wide, often impacting even the most dynamic sectors like cryptocurrency. The financial world is abuzz following the conclusion of the second day of U.S.-China trade talks in Stockholm, a significant milestone in ongoing efforts to stabilize one of the world’s most critical economic relationships. This event, reported by the reliable Walter Bloomberg economic news account on X, marks another crucial step in a series of high-level discussions aimed at easing trade tensions that have long cast a shadow over global markets. Decoding the Latest U.S.-China Trade Talks : A Glimmer of Hope? The recent discussions in Stockholm represent the third round of high-level trade talks between the United States and China this year. These follow previous pivotal meetings: the May 10-11 talks held in Geneva and the subsequent June 9-10 discussions in London. Each round is a painstaking process, designed to bridge significant policy gaps and foster mutual understanding between the two economic giants. The very fact that these dialogues are continuing, despite the complexities, offers a cautious sense of optimism for market participants globally. For those closely watching the pulse of the global economy, the continuation of these U.S.-China trade talks is a beacon. It signals a shared commitment, however fragile, to prevent further escalation of trade disputes. The focus now shifts to the outcomes and the potential for tangible agreements that could alleviate the uncertainty that has plagued businesses and investors alike. Understanding the Tariff Truce and Its Critical Timeline A key element of these ongoing discussions revolves around the possibility of extending the ‘grace period’ for imposing tariffs. If a three-month extension is indeed granted, the existing tariff truce between the two countries is anticipated to last until November. But what does a ‘tariff truce’ truly mean, and why is this timeline so critical? A tariff truce essentially means a temporary cessation of new tariffs or an agreement to not implement previously threatened tariffs. Tariffs, which are taxes on imported goods, have been a primary weapon in the trade dispute, impacting everything from consumer goods to industrial components. Here’s why this extension is so vital: Market Stability: It provides businesses with a predictable environment, allowing them to plan supply chains, investments, and pricing without the immediate threat of new import duties. Economic Breathing Room: For economies grappling with post-pandemic recovery and inflationary pressures, avoiding new tariffs prevents additional costs that could stifle growth. Diplomatic Window: A longer truce provides more time for negotiators to work towards a comprehensive and lasting trade agreement, rather than being pressured by imminent deadlines. Investor Confidence: Reduced trade uncertainty can boost investor confidence, potentially leading to increased capital flows into various asset classes, including traditional equities and, by extension, cryptocurrencies. The November deadline looms large, making the progress achieved in Stockholm, no matter how incremental, extremely important. A failure to extend the truce could re-ignite trade tensions, leading to renewed volatility across global financial markets. Why Do U.S.-China Trade Talks Matter for Global Markets (and Your Crypto Portfolio)? It might seem distant from the world of Bitcoin and Ethereum, but the health of global trade relations, particularly between economic powerhouses like the U.S. and China, directly influences broader market sentiment. Here’s how these U.S.-China trade talks can ripple through to your digital assets: Impact Area Description Relevance to Crypto Global Economic Stability Trade peace fosters economic growth, reduces supply chain disruptions, and stabilizes commodity prices. When traditional markets are stable, investors might be more willing to take on risk in volatile assets like crypto. Conversely, instability can lead to ‘flight to safety’ or a sell-off across all asset classes. Investor Confidence Certainty in trade relations encourages investment and long-term planning. Higher investor confidence in traditional markets can spill over into crypto, attracting new capital and reducing selling pressure. Risk-On/Risk-Off Sentiment Trade tensions often lead to a ‘risk-off’ environment where investors sell riskier assets. In a ‘risk-off’ scenario, crypto assets, especially altcoins, can see significant sell-offs. A ‘risk-on’ environment, often fostered by trade peace, can drive demand for crypto. Supply Chain Health Tariffs and trade barriers disrupt global supply chains, affecting corporate earnings and consumer prices. Disruptions can lead to broader economic slowdowns, impacting disposable income and investment capital that might otherwise flow into crypto. Historically, periods of heightened U.S.-China trade friction have coincided with increased volatility in global equities and sometimes, a correlated dip in crypto markets. While Bitcoin is often touted as ‘digital gold’ and a hedge against traditional market instability, its price can still be influenced by overall risk sentiment. A more stable trade environment can thus contribute to a more predictable, and potentially bullish, outlook for the crypto space. Navigating the Hurdles: Challenges in U.S.-China Trade Negotiations Despite the cautious optimism, it’s crucial to acknowledge the deep-seated complexities that make these U.S.-China trade talks inherently challenging. The issues at stake extend far beyond simple tariffs, encompassing fundamental disagreements on economic structures and global leadership. Key sticking points include: Intellectual Property Rights: The U.S. has consistently accused China of intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers, demanding stronger protections. State Subsidies: China’s extensive state subsidies for its industries are viewed by the U.S. as creating an unfair competitive advantage, distorting global markets. Market Access: U.S. companies often face barriers to entry and operation within the Chinese market, a point of contention in achieving reciprocal trade. Human Rights and Geopolitics: While not directly trade-related, broader geopolitical tensions and human rights concerns can complicate the atmosphere of negotiations and impact trust. These are not issues that can be resolved overnight. They require extensive dialogue, compromise, and a willingness from both sides to make significant concessions. The Stockholm talks, therefore, are likely just one more step in a very long and intricate dance. What Comes Next? The Road Ahead for U.S.-China Trade Relations With the Stockholm round concluded, attention now turns to the immediate aftermath and the next steps in this diplomatic chess game. Will the three-month grace period for tariffs be formally extended? What new proposals, if any, emerged from these latest discussions? And when and where will the next round of high-level talks take place? The outcomes of these negotiations are rarely black and white; often, they involve incremental progress, partial agreements, and continued discussions on more contentious issues. The goal for both nations is to find a pragmatic path forward that avoids a full-blown trade war, which would be detrimental to their own economies and the global financial system. Investors, businesses, and indeed, crypto enthusiasts, will be closely monitoring official statements and expert analyses for any indication of a breakthrough or, conversely, a breakdown in these vital U.S.-China trade talks . The conclusion of the second day of U.S.-China trade talks in Stockholm offers a moment for reflection and anticipation. While no dramatic breakthroughs have been announced, the very continuation of these high-level discussions, especially with the prospect of a tariff truce extension until November, signals a crucial commitment to de-escalation. The intricate dance between the world’s two largest economies profoundly impacts global stability, influencing everything from traditional stock markets to the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. As we move forward, the vigilance of market participants will be key, as the subtle shifts in these trade relations could dictate the prevailing sentiment across all asset classes. The path to a comprehensive agreement remains long and fraught with challenges, but each step, however small, towards dialogue and resolution is a step towards a more predictable global economic future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What were the main objectives of the recent U.S.-China trade talks in Stockholm? A1: The primary objectives of these high-level discussions were to de-escalate trade tensions, address long-standing disagreements on trade practices, and explore the possibility of extending a tariff truce. They aim to create a more stable and predictable trade environment between the two economic powers. Q2: How many rounds of high-level U.S.-China trade talks have there been recently? A2: The Stockholm talks marked the third round of high-level trade discussions this year. Previous rounds were held in Geneva (May 10-11) and London (June 9-10), indicating an ongoing commitment to dialogue. Q3: What is a ‘tariff truce’ and why is its extension important? A3: A ‘tariff truce’ is a temporary agreement to halt the imposition of new tariffs or to extend a grace period on existing ones. Its extension is crucial because it provides businesses with greater certainty, reduces supply chain disruptions, and offers more time for negotiators to work towards a comprehensive trade agreement, thereby stabilizing global markets. Q4: How do U.S.-China trade talks impact cryptocurrency markets? A4: While not directly linked, the outcomes of U.S.-China trade talks significantly influence global economic stability and investor sentiment. A stable trade environment can foster a ‘risk-on’ sentiment, potentially leading to increased investment in volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, escalating trade tensions can trigger ‘risk-off’ behavior, affecting crypto prices. Q5: What are the biggest challenges in reaching a lasting agreement between the U.S. and China? A5: Key challenges include fundamental disagreements over intellectual property rights, state subsidies, market access for foreign companies, and broader geopolitical issues. These complex structural and policy differences require significant compromise from both sides. If you found this article insightful, please consider sharing it with your network!

2025-07-29T16:06:15,"ETHW: Flows Don't Lie, Ethereum Regains Its Footing","Summary Ethereum's momentum has surged, with ETHW up 85% since March, driven by renewed institutional inflows and improving ETH/BTC performance. Spot Ethereum ETFs are seeing record net inflows, nearly matching spot Bitcoin ETFs, signaling strong institutional conviction and capital rotation into ETH. Corporate adoption of Ethereum as a Treasury asset is accelerating, reinforcing ETH's status as a credible institutional asset with significant upside potential. Despite potential short-term volatility from tariff risks, improving flows and favorable ETH/BTC dynamics make ETHW an attractive buy-on-dips opportunity. The Bitwise Ethereum ETF (NYSEARCA: ETHW ) is worth a revisit at this juncture. I last covered ETHW in March, when Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) was underperforming Bitcoin and the ETH/BTC chart was breaking down towards multi-year lows. The inflows into the spot Ethereum ETFs were also weak at the time. But in the hopes of a potential approval of staking in the U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs, I leaned towards a buy rating. ETH has picked up momentum, and ETHW is up 85% since that coverage. With crypto being an inherently volatile asset class, a constant pulse check on the momentum is important for investors to maximize returns. In this article, I'll explore the renewed case for ETHW, the latest surge, and a focus on the ETF's underlying asset, Ethereum. But before we dive into the article, it is worth taking a walk down memory lane on the spot Ethereum ETFs, the hurdles, and progress so far. The spot Ethereum ETFs were approved in May last year, five months after the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETFs. Just like the spot Bitcoin ETFs, the fund managers introduced early fee waivers and other incentives to win investors. Despite the varying fund structures, the ETFs essentially track the same underlying asset, Ethereum. Personally, I favor BITW as a top pick for Ethereum ETFs because of Bitwise’s extensive track record in crypto ETP products. In addition to that, Bitwise already has infrastructure in place with its staking products, which gives it an edge for seamless rollout in the event that staking gets approved for the spot Ethereum ETFs. I covered this strategic positioning for stake extensively in my last ETHW coverage in March. The initial momentum for the spot Ethereum ETFs was weak compared to that of the spot Bitcoin ETF. The recent turnaround in net flows into the spot Ethereum ETFs and the recovery of ETH/BTC are encouraging signals for bulls. What’s driving this surge? Is it sustainable? Is the top near? These are the key questions this article will examine, using data and on-chain signals that support a deeper understanding of Ethereum’s current setup. ETH/BTC: Ethereum's Comeback Signal Ethereum has steadily closed the performance gap with BTC since late April, when ETH hit the yearly low of 0.01805 BTC per ETH. That was an almost 50% drawdown from the year’s open. ETH opened the year at around 0.036 BTC per ETH. The current reversal of the downtrend against BTC is important for our analysis because a rising ETH/BTC pair shows that capital is rotating from Bitcoin into Ethereum. And it is an easy way to understand the relative strength and performance of ETH against BTC. If ETH is lagging too far behind BTC for too long and then begins to recover, that rebound typically marks a sentiment shift. ETH/BTC trend (TradingView) The Catalysts Behind the Comeback It’s an entirely different narrative when straightforward data supports Ethereum’s comeback and validates capital rotation (as the case currently is). This gives fundamental weight to ETH’s relative strength and price action. If that were not the case, then ETH’s rally would look just like a meme coin with no structural thesis. The two main catalysts behind the recent turnaround have been net inflows in the spot Ethereum ETFs and the increasing (and somewhat surprising) adoption of ETH as a corporate treasury asset. Spot Ethereum ETFs monthly net inflows (SoSoValue) Monthly net inflows into the spot Ethereum ETFs have been positive since April, steadily climbing sequentially since then, and this month’s ( July ) net inflow of $5.19 billion is gearing up to be a record month. And here's the standout development: this month, the net inflows into the spot Ethereum ETFs have nearly matched the net inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs. The spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded $6.01 billion in net inflows in July (that's just 3.9% of their total net assets of $153.2 billion). Ethereum's $5.19 billion in net inflows so far in July represent around 24% of its total net assets of $21.3 billion. The spot Ethereum ETFs saw $1.85 billion in net inflows last week, while the spot Bitcoin ETFs saw just $73 million in net inflows. Ordinarily, such a wide divergence would be considered an outlier; however, last week's inflow marks the 11th consecutive week of positive inflows. In the week ended July 18 (the penultimate week), ETH’s net inflows of $2.18 billion nearly matched BTC’s net inflows of $2.39 billion. This shift in flow dynamics shows the intensity of demand for Ethereum, despite it being a smaller asset class in terms of assets under management (AuM). While Bitcoin still has larger total net assets, Ethereum is seeing a disproportionately stronger inflow relative to its size. This is creating a growing conviction in ETH as an institutional asset. Top Ethereum corporate treasury holdings (CoinGecko) That conviction in ETH as an institutional asset is mirrored in the recent uptick in Ethereum adoption by publicly traded companies for their treasury strategy, with these companies now holding about $5 billion worth of ETH on their balance sheet. And these companies have been doubling down on that strategy, announcing subsequent raises and financing rounds earmarked for ETH purchases. For retail investors, this institutional conviction and doubling down point out that Ethereum's upside potential is still very much intact. The data presented in this piece supports the idea that Ethereum’s comeback isn’t just technical; it is being backed by real capital flow, and it is happening faster than many expected. Bitcoin usually leads in the early stages of a crypto bull market. But when ETH/BTC starts rising, it signals increasing risk appetite among both institutions and retail. And this often precedes a broader altcoin rally. Since the proliferation of altcoins, Ethereum has always been positioned to lead the altcoin rally, and with recent adoption and flows data, this time is likely no exception. Risks and Takeaways Though the tariff overhang has eased and markets have shown signs of improvement since President Trump struck a trade deal with the EU , a replay of the U.S.-China tariff escalation, which mainly sparked last April’s market drawdown, still hangs over the outlook. The outcome of the August 1 tariff deadline could be a recipe for potential near-term volatility in Ethereum and its associated spot ETFs. Beyond the tariff overhang, there isn't much macro uncertainty that poses a significant risk to ETH’s upside in the meantime. While volatility remains possible around August 1, the underlying bid for ETH is strengthening with improved flows, favorable ETH/BTC dynamics, and limited macro drag outside the tariff risk, making Ethereum an attractive “buy-on-dips” among the top cryptocurrencies.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4805523-ethw-flows-dont-lie-ethereum-regains-its-footing?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"ETH|BTC|TRADING|REGULATION|MARKET","ETH-USD|ETHW",cryptocompare
2025-07-29T16:03:09,"The Long-awaited Analysis from the Financial World Giant BlackRock Has Arrived! ""How Will the GENIUS Act Affect the Markets?""","BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, made important assessments following the Genius Act stablecoin law signed by US President Donald Trump. The GENIS Act, which has been eagerly awaited for months, was finally passed and went into effect with Trump's signature. While some experts expressed concerns that stablecoins would weaken the dominance of the US dollar, global giant BlackRock offered an opposite analysis. BlackRock said the GENIUS Act could further strengthen the US dollar, according to a report by Walter Bloomberg. BlackRock assessed that stablecoin regulations coming into force in the US could strengthen the dollar's international position. Stating that the new tokenized dollar system will facilitate global payments, BlackRock said that this could increase the dominance of the US dollar. Especially in countries with unstable local currencies, access to dollars will become much easier with stablecoins. The US GENIUS Act framework for dollar-pegged stablecoins enables a tokenized payment system. And if a tokenized dollar system is established, dollar dominance will increase. Access to dollars will become easier, especially in developing countries where access and distribution of ADB dollars are difficult. This could stimulate demand for a more stable digital dollar instead of highly volatile local currencies.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-29T16:02:20,"Tether-backed Twenty One ups Bitcoin stash to 43,500 BTC, eyes Strategy’s crown","In a bold move to rival Michal Saylor-led Bitcoin giant Strategy, Twenty One Capital has grown its stash to over 43,500 BTC following a new infusion from stablecoin issuer Tether. On July 29, the NASDAQ hopeful announced that it had received approximately 5,800 additional Bitcoins from Tether. With over 43,500 BTC now on its books—worth an estimated $5.15 billion—Twenty One Capital has firmly secured its position as the world’s third-largest corporate Bitcoin holder, behind only Strategy and MARA Holdings. Tether fulfills its commitment The latest entry includes two components: 1,381 BTC from a subscription agreement dated June 19, and 4,422 BTC from Tether’s existing obligations under the business combination agreement with Cantor Equity Partners (CEP), the SPAC facilitating Twenty One’s public listing. Of the 5,800 BTC added, 1,381 were acquired through a June 19 subscription agreement tied to new investor commitments, the firm said, without disclosing any further details. The remaining 4,422 BTC were contributed by Tether as part of its previously agreed obligations under the merger deal with Cantor Equity Partners (CEP)—the SPAC guiding Twenty One’s transition into a publicly traded Bitcoin-native company. In early June, Tether sent 10,500 BTC to support SoftBank’s investment in Twenty One Capital, reinforcing the Japanese firm’s position as a key stakeholder ahead of the company’s public listing. Shortly after, Tether moved another 917 BTC to a separate wallet, linked to pre-funding for investors with the option to convert their commitments into equity. Twenty One Capital wants to surpass Strategy Each Bitcoin added brings Twenty One Capital a step closer to the summit long held by Strategy. However, the gap between the two remains vast. Strategy— formerly MicroStrategy —holds an eye-watering 607,770 BTC, a figure that dwarfs even its nearest rivals and stands more than ten times above Twenty One’s current total. Sitting in the middle is MARA Holdings, the Bitcoin mining firm that holds the second spot on the leaderboard. Its reserves, comprising 50,000 BTC, while a fraction of Strategy’s, still keep it ahead of Twenty One—for now. Saylor has a “real rival” Market watchers believe Twenty One’s well-capitalized foundation and political connections give it a competitive edge. “Saylor finally has a real rival,” crypto commentator Marty Party posted on X, referring to CEO Jack Mallers’ stated intent to “raise as much capital as we possibly can to acquire Bitcoin.” Since its formation in April 2025, Twenty One Capital has positioned itself as a pure-play Bitcoin firm. It is majority-owned by Tether and Bitfinex, with SoftBank as a significant minority investor. The firm is led by Strike CEO Jack Mallers, known for his vocal advocacy of Bitcoin and his work on Lightning payments infrastructure. The company plans to go public through a SPAC merger with Cantor Equity Partners (NASDAQ: CEP). Upon completion, it will trade under the ticker symbol “XXI.” Twenty One also introduced a new performance metric—Bitcoin Per Share (BPS)—to track shareholder value in BTC terms, instead of relying on traditional earnings-per-share metrics. However, unlike Strategy, which financed its Bitcoin purchases by issuing shares and debt, Twenty One was launched with nearly $4 billion in BTC provided by its founding partners.

2025-07-29T16:00:49,"Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Begin Distribution: Mirroring Fall 2024 Cycle","Bitcoin trades at a critical level, holding steady above $118,000 but failing to gain momentum for a breakout. Price action has continued to tighten over the past several days, and analysts now anticipate a major move once either key supply zones are absorbed or demand breaks below. The market sits on edge, waiting for confirmation of the next trend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Demand Builds at $117K: Cost Basis Distribution Defines Key Support Level Fresh data from CryptoQuant highlights a notable shift in long-term holder (LTH) behavior. At $118K, LTH supply began to decline, signaling the start of a distribution phase. These holders, known for accumulating during downtrends and selling into strength, are now gradually offloading their positions. This transition often marks the later stages of a bullish trend and echoes patterns from previous macro cycles. As Bitcoin struggles to break past resistance and LTHs reduce exposure, pressure continues to build. A clean breakout above the current range could reignite momentum and drive BTC to new highs, while a break below support may trigger a sharper correction. Either way, the current standoff won’t last much longer. The coming days could bring the decisive move that sets the tone for Bitcoin’s next major leg. LTH Distribution Begins As Bitcoin Mirrors Fall 2024 Pattern Top analyst Axel Adler has highlighted a key development in Bitcoin’s current structure. According to Adler, LTH supply has declined by 52,000 BTC so far, marking a significant shift in behavior. These holders, typically seen as the market’s most patient participants, are now beginning to reduce their exposure—just as Bitcoin remains locked in a tight consolidation range. This shift from accumulation to distribution closely mirrors the LTH behavior seen during fall 2024, when Bitcoin climbed from $65,000 to $100,000. In that period, long-term investors steadily sold into strength as the market pushed higher, locking in profits as late-stage momentum kicked in. Adler suggests that if the current trend continues, the distribution phase will intensify with each price leg up—just as it did in previous macro cycles. The timing of this transition is critical. Bitcoin continues to hover just below all-time highs, while altcoins have begun to show signs of increased volatility. As Ethereum and other major assets begin to move more aggressively, capital rotation may accelerate. Whether this benefits or pressures Bitcoin remains to be seen. Related Reading: TRON Sees $1B USDT Mint: Liquidity Wave Incoming? BTC Holds Steady As Tight Range Continues Bitcoin remains in a tight consolidation range between $115,724 and $122,077, with the 4-hour chart showing price currently hovering around $118,817. After bouncing from the lower boundary last week, BTC has managed to recover and now trades above the 50 SMA ($118,175), 100 SMA ($118,228), and well above the 200 SMA ($113,777). These moving averages have flattened, reflecting the ongoing equilibrium between buyers and sellers. Despite several tests of the $118K zone, BTC continues to respect the key support levels, showing resilience as selling pressure remains muted. Volume, however, remains low—suggesting that traders are still in wait-and-see mode, looking for a decisive breakout before committing to larger positions. Related Reading: Ethereum CME Futures Open Interest Hits Record $7.85B – Is ETH Overheating? The upper resistance at $122K remains untouched since mid-July, and each approach has been met with rejection. A clean break above this level with volume confirmation would signal a continuation of the broader uptrend and could trigger a move toward new all-time highs. On the downside, a break below $115K would invalidate the current structure and likely lead to increased volatility.
