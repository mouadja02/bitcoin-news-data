2025-07-29T08:55:11,"Altseason Unleashed: Why Bitcoin Dominance Signals Explosive Gains for Altcoins","BitcoinWorld Altseason Unleashed: Why Bitcoin Dominance Signals Explosive Gains for Altcoins The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with anticipation, and for good reason. Whispers of an impending Altseason are growing louder, fueled by significant shifts in Bitcoin‚Äôs market dynamics. If you‚Äôve been following the crypto space, you know that when Bitcoin (BTC) makes a move, the rest of the market often follows. But what happens when Bitcoin‚Äôs grip on the market loosens? That‚Äôs precisely what analysts are observing, and it could unlock a period of extraordinary growth for altcoins. Understanding Bitcoin Dominance and the Dawn of Altseason Bitcoin dominance, or BTCD, is a metric that tracks Bitcoin‚Äôs share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. Historically, a rising Bitcoin dominance often means capital is flowing into BTC, sometimes at the expense of altcoins. Conversely, a falling dominance suggests that money is rotating out of Bitcoin and into alternative cryptocurrencies, paving the way for an Altseason . According to BeInCrypto, a notable shift has occurred: Bitcoin‚Äôs market-share index has slid a significant 6.3% in just one month. This isn‚Äôt just a minor fluctuation; it‚Äôs a critical indicator that has formed a bearish cross on the three-week chart and, even more notably, broken a three-year uptrend line. These technical signals are not to be ignored, as they often precede major market movements. What Do These Signals Mean for the Crypto Market? Bearish Cross Formation: This occurs when a short-term moving average crosses below a long-term moving average, often signaling a downtrend for the asset (in this case, Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance). Break of a Three-Year Uptrend Line: A long-standing trend line breaking suggests a significant change in market structure, indicating a potential reversal of the previous trend. For Bitcoin dominance, this means a sustained move downwards. Capital Rotation: When Bitcoin dominance falls, it typically means investors are taking profits from BTC and reallocating them into altcoins, seeking higher potential returns. Why Are Analysts Predicting an Impending Altseason ? The sentiment among experts is clear. Ash Crypto, a prominent analyst, highlighted these bearish signals for Bitcoin dominance as direct harbingers of an Altseason . This isn‚Äôt just speculative talk; it‚Äôs based on historical market cycles where similar patterns have led to substantial rallies in altcoin valuations. Trader Ted further reinforced this view, acknowledging that while short-term pullbacks might occur to ‚Äúshake out weak hands,‚Äù the broader outlook for Ethereum (ETH) and other altcoins is overwhelmingly positive. He anticipates strong gains over the next three to six months. This period aligns with typical market cycles where capital flows from the dominant asset (Bitcoin) into the broader altcoin market once Bitcoin has established a strong foundation or experienced significant gains. The Role of Ethereum in the Next Altseason Ethereum (ETH), often considered the bellwether for the altcoin market, is expected to lead the charge. As the largest smart contract platform, Ethereum‚Äôs ecosystem continues to expand with innovations in Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and Layer-2 scaling solutions. Its strong fundamentals and upcoming upgrades make it a prime candidate for significant appreciation during an Altseason . When Ethereum gains momentum, it often pulls the entire altcoin market with it. Many altcoins are built on the Ethereum blockchain or are closely tied to its ecosystem, meaning ETH‚Äôs performance can have a ripple effect across hundreds of other projects. Navigating the Opportunities: Which Altcoins Could Thrive? While Ethereum is a strong contender, an Altseason typically sees a broad range of altcoins experience parabolic growth. Investors should look beyond just the top few and consider various sectors within the crypto ecosystem. Here are a few areas that often perform well during these periods: Category Description & Potential Examples (Illustrative) Layer-1 Blockchains Alternative foundational networks competing with Ethereum, offering scalability or unique features. Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA) Layer-2 Scaling Solutions Protocols built on top of Layer-1s (like Ethereum) to improve transaction speed and reduce costs. Arbitrum (ARB), Optimism (OP), Polygon (MATIC) Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Protocols offering financial services without intermediaries (lending, borrowing, trading). Uniswap (UNI), Aave (AAVE), Chainlink (LINK) Gaming & Metaverse Projects integrating blockchain into gaming, virtual worlds, and digital ownership. Axie Infinity (AXS), The Sandbox (SAND), Decentraland (MANA) Artificial Intelligence (AI) Tokens Cryptocurrencies powering AI-driven platforms or decentralized AI networks. Fetch.ai (FET), Render Token (RNDR), The Graph (GRT) Actionable Insights for Investors During an Altseason While the prospect of significant gains is exciting, it‚Äôs crucial to approach an Altseason with a well-thought-out strategy. Volatility is inherent in the crypto market, and altcoins can experience rapid price swings. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don‚Äôt blindly follow hype. Investigate the project‚Äôs fundamentals, team, technology, use case, and community. A strong project with real utility has a better chance of sustained growth. Diversify Your Portfolio: Instead of putting all your eggs in one basket, spread your investments across several promising altcoins in different sectors. This helps mitigate risk if one project doesn‚Äôt perform as expected. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders to protect against significant downturns and take profits strategically as your investments grow. Stay Informed: The crypto market moves quickly. Keep up-to-date with news, project developments, and broader market sentiment. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Decide if you are looking for quick gains or holding for long-term potential. Your strategy will dictate your approach to entry and exit points. The breaking of the three-year uptrend line for Bitcoin dominance is a monumental technical signal. It suggests a fundamental shift in market dynamics that could empower altcoins for an extended period. While short-term volatility is always a possibility, the underlying data and expert opinions point towards a highly anticipated period of growth for the broader altcoin market. As we enter this potentially transformative phase, being informed and strategic will be key to capitalizing on the opportunities presented by a thriving Altseason . The stage is set for altcoins to shine, offering investors a chance to diversify and potentially grow their portfolios significantly. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Altseason Q1: What exactly is an Altseason? A1: An Altseason is a period in the cryptocurrency market when altcoins (all cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin) significantly outperform Bitcoin, often leading to substantial price increases across a wide range of alternative digital assets. Q2: How is Bitcoin Dominance related to an Altseason? A2: Bitcoin Dominance (BTCD) measures Bitcoin‚Äôs market capitalization as a percentage of the total crypto market. A falling BTCD typically indicates that capital is flowing from Bitcoin into altcoins, signaling the start or continuation of an Altseason . Q3: How long does an Altseason typically last? A3: The duration of an Altseason can vary widely, from a few weeks to several months, or even longer in some market cycles. Factors like overall market sentiment, macroeconomic conditions, and the pace of capital rotation influence its length. Q4: Is it safe to invest during an Altseason? A4: While an Altseason presents significant profit potential, it also comes with increased volatility and risk. It‚Äôs crucial to conduct thorough research, diversify your portfolio, and only invest funds you can afford to lose. Market corrections can happen rapidly. Q5: What role does Ethereum play in an Altseason? A5: Ethereum (ETH) often acts as a leader for the altcoin market. Its strong performance and ecosystem growth typically precede or accompany a broader Altseason , as many altcoins are built on or are closely related to the Ethereum network. Q6: How can I identify promising altcoins for an Altseason? A6: Look for projects with strong fundamentals, clear use cases, active development teams, growing communities, and relevance in emerging crypto sectors like DeFi, NFTs, gaming, Layer-2 solutions, or AI.

Pompliano thinks so. With inflation weakening the dollar, more companies are turning to Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. Experts say that the U.S. government could be next. Here‚Äôs everything you should know. Dollars or Bitcoin: What‚Äôs the Better Bet? Entrepreneur and investor Anthony Pompliano is challenging big companies to rethink how they handle their money. In a recent interview with CNBC, he said that companies are losing value by holding too much cash, especially as the U.S. dollar keeps getting weaker. Public companies are destroying economic value of their shareholders by holding a large allocation to an asset that is guaranteed to devalue.

I explain to @SquawkCNBC this morning. pic.twitter.com/19u6Babcp6 ‚Äî Anthony Pompliano (@APompliano) July 28, 2025 The dollar has lost about 30% of its buying power in the last five years. So, he asked a tough question: If you‚Äôre a business leader, would you rather hold dollars for the next 10 years or Bitcoin? Putting it simply, he is trying to point out that holding fiat is risky, while Bitcoin offers long-term protection and upside potential. Bitcoin Remains the Top Choice Pompliano believes Bitcoin is still far ahead of the rest of the crypto market. He said that holding Bitcoin on a balance sheet may seem unconventional now, but soon it will become the norm. He recently launched a company called ProCap BTC, which already holds nearly 5,000 Bitcoins valued at over $500 million. When asked about Ethereum and other rising cryptocurrencies, he made it clear that most of Wall Street‚Äôs attention is on Bitcoin, and not Ethereum, Solana, or any other altcoins. ‚ÄúBitcoin has established itself as the king of the market. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs going to change anytime soon.‚Äù As for stablecoins, Pompliano said they could grow in usage but won‚Äôt gain in price, since they are pegged to the dollar. Will the U.S. Government Start Buying Bitcoin? Pompliano made a bold prediction: the U.S. government will eventually start buying Bitcoin. When asked what could push Bitcoin even higher, he said this would be the biggest catalyst of all. A formal move, such as creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, would be a massive shift. He also believes more Wall Street firms that have hesitated so far will soon follow. This prediction may not be far off! Patrick Witt, a senior White House official for digital assets, recently confirmed that the U.S. government is officially moving forward with its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Speaking at the Bitcoin Policy Summit, Witt said a formal report is on the way and that the administration has already started laying the groundwork for a long-term Bitcoin accumulation plan. DID THE US GOVERNMENT JUST SELL 170,000 BTC ($20 BILLION)?

2025-07-29T08:45:48,"Market Vector indexes showed a rush to blue-chip crypto assets","Most Market Vector indexes moved in a positive direction in July, though traders preferred the biggest and most liquid assets. The past month lifted all assets, though there was a divergence between retail and institutional-grade investments. Market Vector‚Äôs indexes showed July was a successful month for crypto, erasing most of the losses from the Q2 correction. However, the indexes pointed at a divergence between institutional-grade crypto and retail activity. Blue chip tokens, especially BTC and ETH, showed significant inflows from institutions, while retail Web3 activity moved sideways. The best proxy for retail activity was the memecoin index. Both established and newer meme tokens are often traded by whales, but they remain the territory of crypto insiders. Market Vector shows the leading indicators for both traditional finance and crypto, updating its indexes on a monthly basis as some tokens are excluded. Memes and DeFi are recovering slowly The meme token index by Market Vector rose from around 50 points at the beginning of the month to over 73 points. The index is still far from its peak in November 2024, when it reached 165 points. For the year to date, meme performance is still carrying a small overall loss. The DeFi index , tracking the top decentralized app assets, returned to levels not seen since February. The index expanded from around 20 points at the beginning of July, to over 31 points. However, the growth was more gradual compared to indexes linked to BTC or ETH. The smart contract index performed slightly better, as it tracked the top L1 platforms. The marker expanded based on its component of ETH and SOL, the leading smart contract platforms at the moment, climbing from 126 points to over 169 points. Crypto media and entertainment assets underperformed, with limited net change for the month. Overall, Web3 projects still show retail activity, but lag behind the performance of blue chip tokens. The infrastructure app index also moved sideways for the past month, with minimal recovery. Blue chip indexes move near all-time highs Indexes reflecting the performance of BTC and blue-chip tokens outperformed in July, with some moving to new all-time highs. As BTC peaked above $123,000, top crypto assets also drew in more liquidity. The chief narrative for top tokens was the creation of corporate treasuries, spreading to ETH , SOL, and BNB. Not all tokens were actually purchased, but even the announcements of new treasuries boosted the assets. The top 10 crypto index accelerated its growth in July, recovering to a yearly high. | Source: Market Vector . The top 10 digital asset index moved to a new record at over 40,000 points, mostly based on Ethereum‚Äôs performance as the asset with the biggest weight. The index climbed from a baseline of 30,000 points at the beginning of the month. It changed one asset in the past month, but reflected the overall performance of ETH and SOL for the period. The Gold Crypto Leader Index showed the wider picture of a rush to inflation-proof assets. The index reached a five-year peak of 683 points, based on the outperformance of gold and top crypto assets. It‚Äôs up more than 100% in the past two years, and is significantly swayed by the performance of gold due to its 53% representation in the index calculation.

2025-07-29T08:30:02,"A Matter Of Time? US May Start Buying Bitcoin Soon, Says Anthony Pompliano","On Monday, Anthony Pompliano, founder and CEO of Professional Capital Management, discussed the state of the crypto market, Wall Street‚Äôs growing interest and adoption of Bitcoin (BTC), and some of the events to look forward to. Wall Street‚Äôs Eyes On Bitcoin In an interview with CNBC‚Äôs Squawk Box, Anthony Pompliano praised the flagship cryptocurrency, affirming that Bitcoin has established itself as the ‚Äúking of the market,‚Äù which won‚Äôt change anytime soon. The CEO asserted that most of Wall Street‚Äôs time and attention is on BTC, as it has ‚Äúkind of broken away,‚Äù while other assets, like Ethereum, have yet to set a new all-time high (ATH) this cycle. He explained that BTC‚Äôs current leading status ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt mean that some of these other assets, maybe, in the future, can‚Äôt do that,‚Äù but noted that BTC continues to dominate the market in market capitalization, capital flow, and attention. Pompliano highlighted that over the past five to seven years, BTC has gone from ‚Äúa contrarian trade to a consensus trade,‚Äù where everyone is convinced that the leading cryptocurrency will be ‚Äúaround for a long time.‚Äù Therefore, ‚ÄúWall Street, who really was kind of ignoring it or trying to stiff-arm Bitcoin, has now said, wait a second, let‚Äôs open up the doors and let‚Äôs embrace this thing because they figured out how to make money.‚Äù He noted that the flagship crypto has been ‚Äúput into Wall Street wrappers,‚Äù like spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), public companies, and real estate funds, which is a trend that will likely continue in the future as it will bring more customers and more profits for these institutions. I think you‚Äôre going to continue to see Wall Street take Bitcoin and put it in every single corner of the traditional financial system, because ultimately, Bitcoin brings volatility. Bitcoin brings financial return in a way that they‚Äôre not used to seeing. BTC‚Äôs Next Big Thing When asked about the ‚Äúnext big thing‚Äù for Bitcoin, Pompliano stated that there are some key factors that people will be paying attention to in the future. One of them will be the US government‚Äôs potential announcement of a BTC purchase. ‚ÄúThe United States government at some point is going to announce that they‚Äôre buying bitcoin,‚Äù he affirmed. The CEO explained that creating the initial Strategic BTC Reserve (SBR) with the assets that the government already had ‚Äúwas good,‚Äù but was never ‚Äúthe main dish.‚Äù To him, ‚Äúthe main dish‚Äù will be the US government buying BTC, which he thinks ‚Äúwill happen at some point.‚Äù Notably, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on March 6 to officially create a Strategic BTC Reserve and a Digital Asset Stockpile, funded by crypto seized from government criminal and civil forfeiture proceedings. Since then, the government has been exploring ‚Äúbudget-neutral‚Äù mechanisms to acquire the flagship crypto. In March, Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis reintroduced the Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide (BITCOIN) Act, originally introduced on July 31, 2024, to establish ‚Äúa strategic Bitcoin reserve to serve as an additional store of value to bolster America‚Äôs balance sheet and ensure the transparent management of Bitcoin holdings of the federal government.‚Äù The bill aims to implement a BTC Purchase Program to buy around 5% of the total BTC supply, or 1 million BTC, over 5 years, mirroring the ‚Äúsize and scope‚Äù of the US gold reserves. The legislation proposes a hold period of at least 20 years for the BTC acquired under the purchase program. Pompliano also named Wall Street‚Äôs ‚Äúwhite flag‚Äù moment as another event that investors will look forward to. He forecasted that one of the things we are ‚Äúgoing to see is some of the last standing people on Wall Street capitulate,‚Äù with a couple of firms continuing to say that BTC is speculative, before they ‚Äúeventually give up and wave the white flag,‚Äù he concluded.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/a-matter-of-time-us-may-start-buying-bitcoin-soon/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX|COMMODITY|ONDO|ENA|GALA","Crypto News|Anthony Pompliano|bitcoin|BITCOIN Act|bitcoin ETFs|Bitcoin Reserve Asset Trump|btc|BTCUSDT|Crypto Market|Digital Asset Stockpile|US President Donald Trump|US Strageic Bitcoin Reserve|wall street bitcoin",cryptocompare

Is U.S. Demand for Bitcoin Collapsing? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market is on high alert today after new data from CryptoQuant shows that the Coinbase Premium Gap for Bitcoin has turned negative for the first time in two months. This important metric may be signaling that buying demand in the United States is growing weaker, which could put more pressure on Bitcoin in the short term. Coinbase‚Äôs Bitcoin Premium Turns Negative For the past 60 days, Bitcoin has been trading at a higher price on Coinbase compared to Binance. This usually signals strong buying interest from U.S.-based investors, especially big institutions. Coinbase is preferred in the U.S. due to its regulatory trust and cleaner reputation. But now, for the first time since late May, this premium has flipped. Bitcoin is cheaper on Coinbase than on Binance. Meanwhile, this flip suggests that U.S. demand has slowed down, especially from big institutions that usually use Coinbase to trade. If this trend continues, Bitcoin might drop further. Analysts believe prices could retest support levels between $118,000 and $116,000 CryptoQuant: Weak U.S. Demand Could Pressure Prices Experts at CryptoQuant warn that this drop in U.S. interest might lead to short-term price pressure. In the past, similar negative shifts were linked to U.S. traders becoming cautious. Adding to this concern, Bitcoin ETF inflows have also slowed down in recent weeks, further showing that investor interest from the U.S. might be cooling off, at least for now. Ethereum Coinbase Premium Turn Neutral On the other hand, CryptoQuant‚Äôs data also highlights that the Ethereum Coinbase Premium Gap is now neutral, which also means US investors are no longer eager buyers. The shift indicator shows that the Ethereum price will slide toward $3,750 to $3,800. But if the premium gap turns positive again soon, it could be a sign that US buyers are returning, which might help push prices back up. As of now, Ethereum is trading around $3,874 , reflecting a slight drop seen in the last 24 hours.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/coinbase-premium-turns-negative-is-u-s-demand-for-bitcoin-collapsing/,"EXCHANGE|BTC|TRADING|ETH|MARKET","News",cryptocompare

2025-07-29T08:15:43,"Bernstein says Ethereum treasuries face liquidity risks","Equity research and brokerage firm Bernstein revealed that Ethereum treasuries are generating more on the digital asset than their Bitcoin-focused counterparts. According to the report, the treasuries are generating staking rewards in addition to holding the virtual asset as a reserve asset. On Monday, the analyst wrote in a note that Ethereum treasuries are facing challenges such as liquidity constraints and smart contract risks that differ from Bitcoin treasury models. The company argued that Ethereum‚Äôs proof-of-stake mechanism allows the firms to stake assets for yield, but Bitcoin‚Äôs proof-of-work structure allows entities to hold BTC without staking. Ethereum Treasuries emerge as next evolution of Strategy‚Äôs playbook Bernstein noted that Ethereum treasuries are also attempting to address limitations on how they deploy capital. According to the report, the treasuries‚Äô staking contracts are liquid, but often wait for days in the queue to unstake. The analyst argued that ETH treasuries need to balance Ethereum liquidity and yield optimization as they stake the digital asset for yield. The brokerage firm added that yield optimization techniques such as the Eigenlayer staking model and DeFi-based yield generation require smart contract security risk management. ‚ÄúThe ETH treasury model has the benefit of actual cash flow yield driving operating earnings, however liquidity risk and security would be important considerations.‚Äù -Bernstein. The report also noted that companies, including SharpLing Gaming (SBET), Bit Digital (BTBT), and BitMine Immersion (BMNR), are focusing on building Ethereum treasuries. According to Bernstein, the trio had accumulated around 876,000 ETH in July, which accounts for 0.9% of the total supply. BMNR revealed last week that it surpassed $2 billion in its ETH holdings. The firm also announced that it‚Äôs aiming to hold and stake around 5% of the total Ethereum supply. Bernstein believes that the growth of the digital dollar and tokenized assets will drive higher user growth in the Ethereum ecosystem. The firm argued that ETH‚Äôs transaction volume on layer-2 chains, operated by platforms like Coinbase and Robinhood, will help Ethereum accrue value from the growth of the asset‚Äôs financial economy. At the time of publication, the digital currency is currently exchanging hands for around $3,809, a 56.42% rise in the last 30 days. BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes has predicted that ETH will surpass its previous record high of $4,800 this year and reach $10,000 by the end of 2025. BitMine Immersion Chair Tom Lee also predicted that the digital asset could hit $60,000, almost 18 times its current value. The equity research firm also argued that Ethereum treasuries have mirrored Strategy‚Äôs model, which shifted its focus from software development to purchasing Bitcoin in 2020. The firm now holds around $72 billion in BTC, but Bernstein believes ETH treasuries could have a more involved risk management strategy compared to Strategy‚Äôs model. DAOs face centralization risks The brokerage company cautioned that Ethereum treasuries also face centralization risks, particularly in governance token distribution and control. The firm argued that treasury platforms such as Karpatkey, Llama, and Avantgarde are controlled by core contributors, which raises concerns over accountability due to the large sums of public capital they manage. According to the firm, DAO‚Äôs internal legal framework makes it hard to identify the responsible party for asset mismanagement. The equity research company believes that, as much as treasury protocols offer undisputed composability, there‚Äôs a void in scaling in a decentralized and compliant manner. Bernstein acknowledged that ETH treasuries are unregulated asset managers, warning that a lack of a clear legal framework would expose them to enforcement action or internal governance breakdowns. The brokerage firm still believes the treasuries will grow as DAOs adapt to financing parameters. The company also hopes that the category will mature as the regulatory environment begins to incorporate clearer standards for decentralized entities. Bernstein forecasts a $1 billion ETH treasure could garner around $30-$50 million in annual returns from staking and yield strategies. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-07-29T08:05:17,"Best crypto to buy now ahead of the Fed meet","Bitcoin hovered around $119,000 on Tuesday, with traders largely sidelined as they await clearer signals on US trade policy and the Federal Reserve‚Äôs upcoming rate decision. After surging to an all-time high above $123,000 earlier in July, the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency has remained rangebound, showing little momentum in either direction. The subdued price action reflects broader market caution as investors digest the potential impact of renewed global trade tensions and the Fed‚Äôs next move on interest rates. With the central bank widely expected to hold rates steady later this week, focus will turn to Chair Jerome Powell‚Äôs guidance on inflation and future policy shifts. However, in this cautious environment, Bitcoin Penguins (BPENGU), a meme-inspired token, has raised over $1 million within a day of its presale launch, signalling a shift in investor appetite amid a lull in major crypto price action. The Fed meeting Ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on July 29‚Äì30, US President Donald Trump has renewed his calls for lower interest rates, but the Federal Reserve appears poised to hold firm. According to CME FedWatch data, there is a 96.9% probability that the Fed will keep its benchmark rate unchanged‚Äîbetween 4.25% and 4.5%‚Äîmarking the fifth consecutive meeting in 2025 without a cut. The central bank has maintained this range since January, defying repeated presidential pressure to ease monetary policy amid strong economic performance. Chair Jerome Powell and the Committee have consistently signalled a preference to wait and assess the broader effects of existing economic policies, including the Trump administration‚Äôs tariffs, before adjusting rates. Despite Trump‚Äôs visit to the Fed last week, where he again urged cuts citing the ‚Äúbooming‚Äù US economy, policymakers have so far resisted. Markets will watch closely for any change in tone from Powell following the July meeting, especially as inflation trends and trade-related uncertainty continue to shape the Fed‚Äôs path forward. The best crypto to buy now has raised over $1 million The presale for Bitcoin Penguins (BPENGU) brings rare structure and urgency to an early-stage token offering, combining a fixed timeline, transparent pricing model, and clear path to listing‚Äîat a time when open-ended presales have begun to wear thin on investors. Split across 15 stages, the crypto presale increases BPENGU‚Äôs price by 5% at each step, leading to a cumulative rise of 75% from Stage 1 to Stage 15. Early entrants stand to capture notional gains of over 75% by the time the token lists. So far, the presale has raised over $1 million, with the next price jump scheduled within the next 25 hours. The escalating price structure is designed to reward early participation and drive sustained momentum‚Äîan intentional contrast to the prolonged, often delayed presales that have tested investor patience. The presale is capped at 30 days, ending August 27 or sooner if the $10 million hard cap is met. A claim and listing date of September 2 has already been confirmed, giving investors the rare advantage of knowing the token‚Äôs public timeline from the outset. That clarity has struck a chord with buyers seeking transparency and timely execution. With its Bitcoin integration, meme-powered branding, and strong early demand, BPENGU is shaping up as a serious contender in the current altcoin rotation‚Äîand possibly the next meme project to break into the mainstream.

2025-07-29T08:00:38,"Analyst Says The Patient Will Be Rewarded As Ethereum Price Retests 4-Year Resistance","Despite what is akin to a bull market with the Bitcoin price hitting multiple new all-time highs, the Ethereum price continues to hit major resistances in its campaign for new highs. The most recent is the resistance push at the $3,800, which perfectly aligns with the 4-year resistance line that has kept the leading altcoin by market cap from hitting new all-time highs. However, as Ethereum once again gears up for a retest, this time could be the chart that signals the breakout. Ethereum On The Verge Of Breakout Crypto analyst MMCrypto highlighted a possible breakout on the Ethereum price chart after the altcoin moved back toward a 4-year resistance trendline. This trendline had begun back in 2021 when the Ethereum price had hit its $4,800 all-time high, and since then, it has become the resistant trendline to beat for the ETH price to rally to new highs. Related Reading: Dormant Whale Sells $80,000 BTC, But Bitcoin Bulls Still In Control Over the last four years, this resistance trendline has held firmly, beating the Ethereum price back down from the $4,000 level. This has prevented a rally toward its $4,800 and made the $5,000 expected target push even farther away. But now, there could be another opportunity for Ethereum to turn the tide and break this resistance once and for all. Currently, the ETH price is still trending below $4,000, suggesting that the bears are still holding the resistance line. With the price trading below this resistance, MMCrypto points out that ETH has now been underperforming for four years. Given this, a large number of investors have lost money on their investments or haven‚Äôt seen a profit. The major target now is for the resistance to be broken. The crypto analyst explains that once this happens, then the Ethereum price could see a monumental pump from here. This pump, he explains, will be fueled by investors who have yet to realize any profit on their ETH holdings over the last four years. Related Reading: XRP Bullish Cross Playing Out Again: $9 Or $24 Next? With the expectation that the resistance trendline will be broken, the analyst urges investors to be patient. He points out that once the pump begins, those who were patient will be the ones to reap the profits of this ETH price action. Additionally, Ethereum will not be the only altcoin to benefit from a pump. Previous altcoin seasons have been sparked by movements in the Ethereum price, and if ETH is able to break toward a new all-time high, then the altcoin market is expected to follow suit. ‚ÄúThe Ethereum Pump if & when it happens, will have a broad influence on the whole Crypto Space & take many Altcoins with it!

Celestia and modular rollups enhance Ethereum ‚Äòs performance and expansion, impacting the competition among L1 public chains. Public chains like BNB Chain and Celo opt to integrate with Ethereum as L2 Rollups due to liquidity and cost advantages. Celestia‚Äôs scalability and user-friendly design make it an appealing choice for developers, offering additional scalability to the blockchain ecosystem. Why is the TIA price down today? TIA‚Äôs price is attempting to hold above $2; however, bears strongly dominated and created a plunge. Will the TIA price reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment and buying demand, we might see TIA‚Äôs price touching the $100 milestone in the coming years. According to our prediction, the TIA price might hit the $100 mark in 2030. Will the TIA price reach $1,000? If the altcoin market remains robust in the coming years and Celestia develops more user-friendly utilities, its price might surpass $1K. Is TIA a good long-term investment? Yes, TIA is a good long-term investment option. As buyers‚Äô interest grows and the network expands, we might see profitable returns. Recent news/opinions on TIA Noble has introduced AppLayer, a new platform designed to help developers create financial tools and apps with fast, reliable stablecoin infrastructure on the Celestia network. Celestia price prediction July 2025 Celestia‚Äôs price is recovering its momentum as Bitcoin aims for a surge above the $110K mark.

Based on a deep technical analysis of past TIA price data, the price of Celestia is predicted to reach a minimum level of $1, a potential maximum of $21.22, and an average trading price of $18.47 in 2025.
