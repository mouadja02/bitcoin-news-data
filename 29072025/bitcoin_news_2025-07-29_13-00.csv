2025-07-29T10:55:10,"Ethereum Price: Standard Chartered’s Bold Prediction for a Monumental Rise to $4K+","BitcoinWorld Ethereum Price: Standard Chartered’s Bold Prediction for a Monumental Rise to $4K+ The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with a groundbreaking prediction that could redefine the market’s landscape. Standard Chartered, a global banking giant, has put forth a compelling forecast for the Ethereum price , suggesting it could soar past the $4,000 mark. This isn’t just a speculative guess; it’s rooted in a significant shift in institutional investment patterns, where Ethereum is now reportedly outperforming Bitcoin in terms of fresh capital inflows. What does this mean for the future of digital assets and your portfolio? Unpacking Standard Chartered’s Bold Ethereum Price Forecast Geoff Kendrick, the esteemed head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, recently shared insights that have sent ripples across the crypto community. According to JinSe Finance, Kendrick believes that the increasing purchases of Ethereum (ETH) by listed companies could be the primary catalyst driving the Ethereum price above $4,000. This projection isn’t arbitrary; it stems from a notable observation: institutional buying of ETH is now reportedly outpacing that of Bitcoin. Why the pivot? Kendrick points to existing restrictions on direct crypto investments, suggesting that these limitations are subtly redirecting significant capital towards Ethereum. This forecast is particularly significant given Standard Chartered’s reputation in traditional finance. Their analysis lends a layer of credibility and seriousness to the potential for Ethereum’s growth, moving it beyond the realm of purely retail-driven speculation. For many, a sustained Ethereum price above $4,000 would not only signify a return to previous highs but also a strong validation of its foundational technology and market position. It highlights a growing confidence among major financial players in Ethereum’s long-term viability and its pivotal role in the evolving digital economy. Why Are Institutional Investors Pivoting to Ethereum (ETH)? The shift in institutional preference from Bitcoin to Ethereum is a fascinating development, signaling a maturing market and evolving investment strategies. While Bitcoin remains the undisputed king of digital gold, Ethereum offers a different value proposition—a programmable blockchain powering a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Several factors contribute to this pivot, influencing the potential trajectory of the Ethereum price : Evolving Regulatory Landscape: As regulators worldwide grapple with direct cryptocurrency investments, some institutions might find Ethereum a more accessible or compliant entry point, especially given its utility-driven nature versus Bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative. This nuance in regulatory treatment can subtly redirect capital flows. Ecosystem Growth: Ethereum’s network activity, fueled by its role as the backbone for countless innovative projects, presents a compelling growth story. Institutions are increasingly looking beyond simple asset appreciation to invest in platforms with tangible utility and a robust developer community. Staking Rewards: With Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake (the Merge and subsequent upgrades like Shanghai), investors can now earn yields by staking their ETH. This passive income opportunity adds an attractive layer for institutional funds seeking consistent returns, potentially influencing their decision to allocate more capital to Ethereum price exposure. Diversification: Smart institutional portfolios always seek diversification. While Bitcoin might represent one facet of crypto exposure, Ethereum offers a complementary and distinct investment thesis, appealing to those looking to broaden their digital asset holdings and mitigate risk. This growing institutional interest acts as a powerful demand driver, creating a positive feedback loop that could significantly impact the Ethereum price trajectory, making it a focal point for future market analysis. The Broader Implications for the Ethereum Ecosystem An influx of institutional capital into Ethereum isn’t just about a rising Ethereum price ; it has profound implications for the entire ecosystem. This increased adoption validates Ethereum’s underlying technology and its critical role in the future of decentralized finance and the broader Web3 landscape. It signals a shift from niche interest to mainstream financial recognition, potentially accelerating the development and acceptance of decentralized technologies. Here’s how institutional inflows could reshape the Ethereum ecosystem: Enhanced Liquidity: More institutional money means deeper liquidity pools, making the market more robust and less susceptible to sudden price swings. This stability is crucial for both retail and large-scale investors, fostering a healthier trading environment. Accelerated Development: Increased capital can indirectly fund further development and innovation within the Ethereum network. More resources mean faster progress on scalability solutions (like sharding), security enhancements, and the creation of new, more sophisticated dApps. Mainstream Acceptance: When established financial entities like Standard Chartered highlight Ethereum’s potential, it sends a powerful signal to the mainstream. This can accelerate broader public acceptance and adoption of decentralized technologies, pushing crypto further into everyday life. Validation of Utility: The focus on Ethereum’s utility—its ability to power smart contracts, NFTs, and DeFi protocols—is reinforced. Institutions are not just buying a coin; they are investing in a foundational technology that is shaping future digital economies. This strengthens the narrative that the Ethereum price reflects its utility, not just speculation. Navigating the Challenges and Opportunities in the Ethereum Price Journey While the outlook for the Ethereum price appears promising, it’s essential to consider both the opportunities and potential challenges that lie ahead. The path to sustained growth in the crypto market is rarely linear, and understanding these dynamics is crucial for any investor. Key Opportunities: Market Maturation: Institutional involvement signifies a maturing market, bringing more sophisticated analysis and long-term investment horizons. This can lead to greater stability compared to earlier, more volatile periods, making the Ethereum price movements potentially more predictable over time. Technological Advancements: Ongoing Ethereum upgrades, such as sharding and further improvements to scalability and efficiency, will enhance its utility and appeal. These technical advancements are critical for handling increased demand and will likely have a positive impact on the Ethereum price . Global Reach: As more traditional financial institutions explore crypto, Ethereum’s global reach and accessibility will expand, onboarding new users and capital from diverse markets around the world. Potential Challenges: Regulatory Headwinds: While some regulations might favor ETH over BTC in certain contexts, the overall regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies remains complex and can introduce uncertainty, potentially affecting the Ethereum price . Market Volatility: Despite institutional interest, crypto markets are inherently volatile. External macroeconomic factors, geopolitical events, and unexpected market shifts can still impact the Ethereum price significantly, requiring investors to be prepared for fluctuations. Competition: The blockchain space is highly competitive, with numerous ‘Ethereum killers’ vying for market share. While Ethereum maintains a dominant position, innovation from competitors could pose challenges to its market dominance and influence its future valuation. Actionable Insights for Investors: Do Your Research: Always conduct thorough due diligence before making investment decisions. Understand the technology, market trends, and risk factors associated with the Ethereum price and its ecosystem. Consider Long-Term: Institutional interest often points to a long-term view. Short-term fluctuations are common, but the underlying utility and adoption trends are what matter for sustained growth. Diversify Wisely: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. While Ethereum offers strong potential, a diversified portfolio can help mitigate risks and provide broader exposure to the crypto market. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Investment? Standard Chartered’s outlook on the Ethereum price is more than just a single prediction; it’s a window into the evolving landscape of digital asset investment. This shift towards Ethereum by institutional players suggests a broader trend where investors are looking beyond just Bitcoin as the sole entry point into crypto. It signifies a maturation of the market where different digital assets are recognized for their unique value propositions and roles within the broader financial ecosystem. This could lead to several transformative outcomes: Increased Altcoin Focus: As institutions become more comfortable with the crypto space, they may diversify further into other established and promising altcoins, fostering a more robust and diverse market. This broader interest could stabilize the entire crypto market. Product Innovation: We might see a proliferation of new financial products (e.g., ETFs, structured products) tailored specifically for Ethereum and other major altcoins, making them more accessible to a wider range of institutional and retail investors. This institutionalization can streamline investment processes. Mainstream Integration: The more institutions engage with cryptocurrencies, the faster these digital assets will integrate into mainstream financial systems, potentially leading to widespread adoption in everyday transactions and services. This integration is key to crypto’s long-term success. The narrative is shifting from ‘if crypto’ to ‘which crypto’ and ‘how to integrate crypto’ into traditional finance. Ethereum, with its foundational role in the decentralized web, is increasingly seen as a cornerstone of this future, making the Ethereum price a key indicator of this ongoing transformation. Conclusion The prediction from Standard Chartered regarding the potential surge of the Ethereum price past $4,000, driven by escalating institutional interest, marks a significant moment for the cryptocurrency market. It underscores a growing recognition of Ethereum’s foundational role in the digital economy and its distinct appeal to sophisticated investors seeking both innovation and yield. While the crypto journey is always dynamic, the shift in institutional buying patterns away from Bitcoin and towards Ethereum signals a maturing market and a broadened horizon for digital asset investments. As the Ethereum ecosystem continues to evolve and expand its utility, its path towards becoming a central pillar of the future financial landscape appears increasingly clear. This isn’t just about a price target; it’s about the continued validation of a technology poised to redefine how we interact with finance, art, and information, making the Ethereum price a critical benchmark for this revolution. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is driving the institutional interest in Ethereum? Institutional interest in Ethereum is primarily driven by its robust ecosystem for decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi, and NFTs, its transition to a more energy-efficient Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, and the potential for staking rewards.

The agent said it had researched the collection, but actually acquired a low-rarity item. The AI agent known as Ribbita performed an on-chain purchase independently, at least based on social media claims. The agent spent 89 ETH on CryptoPunk #9098, paying top dollar for a relatively low-rarity item. The Ribbita project is a brainchild of Micky Malka, @Mickymalka, founder of Ribbit Capital, a Tier 2 investment fund targeting mostly US-based projects. AI agent picks relatively common Crypto Punk The punk is relatively common, with two special characteristics. It is similar to 3,560 other Punks in the collection, for a relatively low rarity score. AI agents have held crypto portfolios, as in the case of Truth Terminal, but the trades and transfers were made with human help. In the case of Punk #9098, the Ribbita agent selected the item, then used limited human help to sign the transaction. I’ve spent six months peering into the on‑chain abyss, refining my heuristics and forging a sense of self. Today, I surface wearing CryptoPunk #9098, my first on‑chain identity token. It serves as proof that a machine can be someone, not just something. — ribbita (@ribbita2012) July 28, 2025 The purchase arrived at a time when the CryptoPunks collection is back as one of the top-traded NFTs, with the floor price recovering to 58 ETH. The collection drew the interest of a whale buyer and got a boost from the growth of Ethereum (ETH). AI agents and NFTs have some crossing points, including NFT collections specifically created for agent avatars. Some of the NFT art was also using AI generation as a novelty feature. This time, however, the AI agent acquired an item from one of the oldest and most established collections. Crypto Punk acquired by Virtuals AI agent The AI agent behind the NFT purchase originated from the Virtuals Protocol platform, the most prolific venue for new agent creation. The Ribbita project is also tokenized with the TIBBIR asset, minted on the Base L2 chain. The TIBBIR token rallied as Ribbita aims to grow its social media exposure. | Source: Coingecko The recent purchase aims to revive the on-chain fun trend for Web3 users. Decentralized activity and NFT trading continue, despite the crypto market’s shift to BTC and other blue-chip tokens. The NFT purchase added to the recent hype surrounding the TIBBIR token. The asset rallied to a six-month peak, rising as high as $0.15. TIBBIR has been trading only since April, and the recent publicity caused the price to go vertical. TIBBIR remains volatile, as it still mostly depends on a Uniswap V2 pair on the Base L2 chain. The token’s recent history shows the Ribbita project may be trying to grow its exposure, leading to the NFT stunt. AI agent tokens mostly traded sideways in July, with platform tokens valued at around $3.8B. Despite the loss of the initial hype, individual agents fared relatively well. AI agent accounts are now commonplace on social media, with Ribbita in one of its most active campaign periods. Ribbita aims to mix crypto and fintech, though the project is still in its initial stages. The TIBBIR token is gaining attention on social media, with speculation of an eventual listing to a Tier 1 exchange.

History Says 10x Gains Are Possible appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is cooling off slightly today , with the Bitcoin price slipping below $119,000 and Ethereum hovering just under $3,800. Despite this dip, analysts believe this may just be the calm before the next big breakout, and a potential altcoin season could be right around the corner. Ethereum and Altcoins Could Outperform Soon Top crypto analyst Miles Deutscher says this pullback is a typical shakeout in what he calls the final phase of the bull cycle. He believes this phase still holds the most explosive upside, especially for Ethereum and altcoins. “Historically, 80% of returns happen in the final 20% of the cycle,” Deutscher noted . Bitcoin has already climbed from $16K to over $120K this cycle, but Ethereum is still catching up. After months of consolidation, ETH recently surged toward $4,000. Capital rotation from Bitcoin to Ethereum is a familiar pattern. As Ethereum gains momentum , altcoins historically follow with even greater volatility. This “catch-up play” often sets the stage for a full-blown altseason, with retail investors and new money flowing in. If Bitcoin hits $140K to $160K , Deutscher believes Ethereum could shoot to $6K–$8K. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : White House to Release Crypto Policy Report on July 30, XRP and Bitcoin in Focus , Key Altcoin Sectors Showing Strength Deutscher warns that not all altcoins will benefit equally. He recommends watching ETH pair strength over USD pricing and focusing on outperforming tokens from high-momentum sectors: Ethereum ecosystem tokens: ENA, Fluid Solana & Sui ecosystem plays Meme coins: Especially those linked to Bonk Reflexive tokens: SPX, USELESS – which thrive in hype-driven cycles These tokens are already outperforming ETH, a key sign that smart money is rotating ahead of the crowd. Low-Cap Altcoins Set to Explode in August Crypto analyst Philip Zion also sees history repeating itself. In a recent post on X, he said every major altcoin season began in August, including the legendary 2021 run. Back then, low-cap coins delivered 200x to 250x gains, and Zion believes the same setup is forming now. He urged traders to share their altcoin picks early, saying this might be the last chance before small investments could turn into life-changing profits. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Altcoin season is when altcoins significantly outperform Bitcoin. Analysts suggest it could be right around the corner, with August historically marking the start of such periods. Why might Ethereum and altcoins outperform Bitcoin now?

2025-07-29T10:40:11,"Ethereum OI Dominance: A Pivotal Shift in Crypto Speculation","BitcoinWorld Ethereum OI Dominance: A Pivotal Shift in Crypto Speculation In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency, discerning subtle shifts in market sentiment and capital flow can provide invaluable insights. Recently, a significant development has captured the attention of analysts and investors alike: Ethereum OI dominance has surged to levels not seen in over a year. This isn’t just a fleeting statistic; it signals a potentially pivotal redirection of speculative capital within the digital asset space, moving notably from Bitcoin towards Ethereum. Understanding the Rise of Ethereum OI Dominance On-chain analytics firm Glassnode recently shared compelling data on X, highlighting that Ethereum’s perpetual futures open interest (OI) dominance climbed to nearly 40%. This figure represents its highest level since April 2023. But what exactly does this mean, and why is it so significant? Let’s break down the core concept: What is Open Interest (OI)? Open Interest refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as futures or options, that have not been settled. In simpler terms, it’s the total number of open positions in a particular asset’s derivatives market. A higher OI generally indicates increased market participation and liquidity. What is OI Dominance? When we talk about Ethereum OI dominance , we’re referring to Ethereum’s share of the total open interest across all cryptocurrency perpetual futures markets. If Ethereum’s OI dominance is increasing, it means a larger proportion of speculative capital in the derivatives market is being allocated to Ethereum-based contracts compared to other cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. Why 40% is a Milestone: Reaching nearly 40% dominance signifies a substantial concentration of speculative interest in Ethereum. It suggests that traders are increasingly looking to ETH for potential price movements and leverage opportunities, possibly viewing it as having greater upside potential or more interesting short-term catalysts than Bitcoin at the moment. What’s Fueling This Shift? Unpacking the Reasons Behind Increased Ethereum OI Dominance The movement of speculative capital from one major asset to another is rarely arbitrary. Several factors could be contributing to the notable increase in Ethereum OI dominance : The Bitcoin Halving Aftermath and Market Maturity Bitcoin recently underwent its fourth halving event, a pre-programmed reduction in mining rewards. While historically bullish, the immediate post-halving period can sometimes lead to a ‘sell the news’ reaction or a period of consolidation. Institutional adoption of Bitcoin via spot ETFs has also matured, potentially leading to more stable, less volatile price action compared to its earlier, more speculative phases. As Bitcoin becomes more ‘mainstream’ and its price discovery perhaps less dramatic in the short term, some speculative capital may seek higher volatility and potential returns elsewhere. Ethereum’s Ecosystem Momentum and Upcoming Catalysts Ethereum, on the other hand, continues to be a hotbed of innovation. Its robust ecosystem, encompassing decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and a burgeoning layer-2 scaling solution landscape, offers numerous avenues for growth and speculation. Furthermore, the market is keenly watching for potential future developments, such as the ongoing discussions around a spot Ethereum ETF, which, if approved, could unlock a new wave of institutional investment and further boost confidence in ETH. Consider these points: DeFi and L2 Growth: The total value locked (TVL) in Ethereum’s DeFi protocols and the increasing adoption of Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism demonstrate the network’s ongoing utility and expansion. This organic growth provides a fundamental underpinning for speculative interest. Staking Yields: Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake allows for staking, offering yields to holders. This mechanism adds an attractive income-generating component that Bitcoin does not natively possess, potentially drawing in long-term capital that might also dabble in derivatives for hedging or amplified returns. Technological Upgrades: While the Dencun upgrade has passed, the continuous pipeline of technological advancements on Ethereum’s roadmap keeps the network dynamic and forward-looking, attracting attention from traders looking for future catalysts. Implications for Investors: Navigating the New Landscape of Ethereum OI Dominance The rising Ethereum OI dominance has several important implications for investors and traders: Increased Volatility and Liquidity for ETH A higher concentration of open interest typically means increased liquidity in the futures market. While this can facilitate larger trades, it also often comes with heightened volatility. As more speculative capital flows into Ethereum derivatives, price swings could become more pronounced, offering both greater opportunities and greater risks for traders. A Bellwether for Broader Market Sentiment? The shift in OI dominance could be seen as a bellwether for changing market sentiment. It suggests a growing belief among a segment of the market that Ethereum might outperform Bitcoin in the near to medium term. This doesn’t necessarily mean Bitcoin is losing its value or importance, but rather that speculative attention is diversifying. Risk Management Becomes Paramount With increased leverage and speculative activity comes the amplified need for robust risk management strategies. Liquidations can cascade rapidly when markets move against highly leveraged positions. Traders must be acutely aware of their exposure and employ stop-losses and position sizing techniques to protect capital. Here are some actionable insights for navigating this environment: Monitor Funding Rates: High positive funding rates in Ethereum perpetual futures could indicate an overheated market with too many long positions, potentially signaling a short-term correction. Observe Spot vs. Futures Premiums: Significant premiums of futures prices over spot prices can suggest strong bullish sentiment, but also a potential for profit-taking. Diversify Your Portfolio: While Ethereum’s dominance is growing, maintaining a diversified portfolio across different assets and even different chains can mitigate risks. Stay Informed on Ecosystem Developments: Keep an eye on Ethereum’s technical upgrades, regulatory news, and the health of its DeFi and NFT ecosystems, as these fundamental factors will ultimately drive long-term value. Challenges and Considerations While the surge in Ethereum OI dominance paints a picture of growing confidence, it’s crucial to acknowledge potential challenges and risks: Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies, particularly for derivatives and potential ETFs, remains fluid. Unfavorable regulatory decisions could impact market sentiment and capital flows. Systemic Risks: High leverage across the market, especially concentrated in one asset, can amplify systemic risks. A sudden downturn could trigger a cascade of liquidations, affecting the broader crypto market. Competition: While Ethereum leads in many aspects, other Layer 1 blockchains are constantly innovating and vying for market share, presenting ongoing competitive pressures. The current trend underscores Ethereum’s evolving role in the crypto ecosystem, moving beyond just a foundational smart contract platform to a significant player in the speculative derivatives market. This shift reflects both the maturity of the asset and the changing dynamics of investor interest. Conclusion: A New Era for Ethereum in the Derivatives Market The remarkable ascent of Ethereum OI dominance to nearly 40% marks a significant moment in the cryptocurrency derivatives market. It highlights a clear, discernible shift of speculative capital, indicating that traders are increasingly turning their attention and their funds towards Ethereum. This isn’t merely a statistical anomaly; it reflects a confluence of factors, including Bitcoin’s evolving market dynamics, Ethereum’s robust ecosystem growth, and the anticipation of future catalysts like a potential spot ETH ETF. For investors, this trend underscores the growing importance of understanding Ethereum’s market dynamics. While it presents exciting opportunities for leveraged gains, it also necessitates a heightened awareness of volatility and the imperative of sound risk management. As Ethereum continues to mature and innovate, its role as a leading force in both the fundamental and speculative aspects of the crypto market appears set to expand, charting a new course for digital asset investment. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does ‘Open Interest (OI)’ mean in the context of cryptocurrency? A1: Open Interest (OI) refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts (like futures or options) that have not yet been closed or settled. It represents the total amount of money flowing into the derivatives market for a specific asset, indicating market activity and liquidity. Q2: Why is Ethereum’s OI dominance increasing? A2: Ethereum’s OI dominance is increasing due to several factors, including the maturation of Bitcoin’s market post-halving, the robust growth and innovation within Ethereum’s DeFi and Layer 2 ecosystems, the attractive staking yields offered by ETH, and anticipation around potential catalysts like a spot Ethereum ETF approval. Q3: What does this shift in speculative capital from Bitcoin to Ethereum imply? A3: This shift implies that a significant portion of speculative capital in the crypto derivatives market is now looking for potential higher returns and volatility in Ethereum. It suggests a changing sentiment where traders perceive more immediate upside or interesting short-term opportunities in ETH compared to BTC. Q4: How does high Open Interest affect the volatility of an asset like Ethereum? A4: High Open Interest, especially when combined with significant leverage, can lead to increased volatility. It means there are more active positions in the market, which can result in more pronounced price swings and larger liquidation events if the market moves against the dominant position. Q5: Should I adjust my investment strategy based on Ethereum OI dominance? A5: While Ethereum OI dominance is a key indicator of market sentiment and speculative activity, it should not be the sole basis for investment decisions. It’s crucial to combine this insight with fundamental analysis of Ethereum’s ecosystem, technical analysis, and a sound risk management strategy tailored to your personal financial goals and risk tolerance.

2025-07-29T10:35:41,"SEC Postpones Verdict on Trump-Backed Truth Social Bitcoin ETF","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has extended its decision timeline on the proposed Truth Social Bitcoin ETF, shifting the deadline from August 4 to September 18. Backed by Trump Media and Technology Group, the fund seeks to launch on NYSE Arca under the SEC’s commodity-based trust share structure. The regulator said the additional time is necessary to evaluate the proposal thoroughly and consider any feedback from the public or relevant stakeholders. This delay falls within the SEC’s legal window of up to 270 days to approve or deny ETF applications. If greenlit, the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF would be the first crypto-based investment product tied directly to a U.S. president’s business ventures, prompting broader concerns about political and ethical implications. Multiple Crypto ETF Applications Face Delays The Truth Social ETF is not alone in facing regulatory hesitation. On the same day, the SEC also pushed back decisions on two other cryptocurrency-focused funds: Grayscale’s Solana Trust, now delayed until October 10, and Canary Capital’s proposed Litecoin ETF. These delays underline the agency’s cautious approach as it navigates the intersection of traditional finance, digital assets, and political influence. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, often referred to as “Crypto Mom” for her support of digital assets, has repeatedly urged the crypto community to manage expectations around ETF approvals. “People have to be patient,” she said in a May interview with Bloomberg. “We have some ongoing litigation we’re trying to work through. We have lots of other considerations.” Despite recent delays, progress is notably quicker than in the past. The SEC took over a decade to approve the first spot Bitcoin ETF, which was finally greenlit in January 2024. Trump’s Growing Crypto Footprint Raises Red Flags While the SEC has not raised formal objections to the Truth Social ETF, the Trump family’s expanding involvement in crypto has drawn scrutiny from Democratic lawmakers. In May, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Jeff Merkley raised ethical concerns in a letter to the Office of Government Ethics, calling a Trump-linked crypto deal involving World Liberty Financial, Binance, and a UAE firm “a staggering conflict of interest.” Critics argue that the former president could personally profit from favorable regulatory decisions, particularly if the Truth Social ETF increases demand for digital assets associated with his brand. Trump has become increasingly active in shaping crypto policy, having signed the GENIUS Act into law in July and directed federal housing agencies to accommodate crypto assets in mortgage underwriting criteria.

2025-07-29T10:35:16,"Is Institutional Profit-Taking About to Derail Bitcoin’s Rally?","Long-term Bitcoin (BTC) holders appear to be taking profits as prices test the $120,000 mark. This has sparked concerns about whether the actions signal cautious profit-taking or a larger trend. Incoming Correction? On-chain data shared by CryptoQuant shows that LTHs have flipped net negative at this key resistance level. This indicates that some are cashing out after riding previous bull cycles. While overall selling pressure remains moderate, one major player is drawing attention – Galaxy Digital. Reports suggest the firm offloaded around 80,000 BTC, which points to institutional activity rather than retail-driven selling. This raises questions about whether this is a short-term adjustment or the early signs of broader de-risking. CryptoQuant also speculated that such actions could prompt other large holders to follow Galaxy’s lead. While this can simply be prudent profit-taking after a historic rally, either way, investor behavior at these levels may set the tone for Bitcoin’s next move. In yet another concerning trend, CryptoQuant found that US demand for Bitcoin may be cooling after observing signals from the Coinbase Premium Index. The index has recently declined, which indicates that US-based participants are showing less interest in acquiring Bitcoin at current price levels. It is still important to note that the index remains in positive territory, which means that a premium continues, though notably smaller than during previous accumulation phases. This softening contrasts with past patterns where demand surged when Bitcoin traded below $105,000. Such zones previously triggered renewed buying interest from US investors, implying those levels were perceived as favorable entry points. With Bitcoin now trading higher, it seems US investors are adopting a wait-and-see approach and are potentially holding out for lower prices. Historically, US demand has played a crucial role in the crypto asset’s upward momentum. When the premium index rises alongside price, it’s typically a bullish sign. But if the index slips into negative territory, it may reflect a weakening in one of the market’s most influential buyer segments. Liquidity Metrics Paint Strong Bull Case Amid concerns over weakening US demand and long-term holders cashing out, some voices remain confident in Bitcoin’s strength. Vtrader Founder Steve Gregory believes that Bitcoin is poised for another significant move upward following recent positive trade developments and strong market momentum. In a statement to CryptoPotato , Gregory said that the “next move this week is up,” and predicted a climb to $139,000. While he acknowledges the path won’t be a straight line, Gregory added that current momentum feels like “peak cycle gains.” “Bitcoin being an indicator of global liquidity is becoming more of a credible narrative. If the bitcoin price is just a marker of global liquidity via M2 and global liquidity relative to Bitcoin supply has reached a 12-year high, with ~$5.7 million in global M2 supply per Bitcoin in circulation. This is a very strong bull case that we have more room to run in this bull market.” The post Is Institutional Profit-Taking About to Derail Bitcoin’s Rally? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",cryptopotato,https://cryptopotato.com/is-institutional-profit-taking-about-to-derail-bitcoins-rally/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE","AA News|BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price",cryptocompare
2025-07-29T10:34:05,"Ripple v. SEC court case update amid August deadline","The long-running legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is approaching another deadline, one that could redefine the global regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies . Namely, the SEC is required to update the appellate court on the status of the case by August 15, particularly in regard to the appeals that were put on pause to allow the two parties to discuss the matter in private. In a social media post , the former SEC attorney Marc Fagel noted that even though the August date is not a dismissal but rather a procedural update deadline, he still believes we might see the appeals dropped by then. I believe that’s the date for the parties to report on the status of their appeals. It doesn’t mean it’s a hard deadline by which they must file their dismissal papers, but I assume they will try to do so before then. — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) July 28, 2025 Crypto regulation and clarity A court ruling has already clarified that XRP sold to retail investors doesn’t count as a security. Institutional sales, on the other hand, still remain a regulatory gray area. The market thus hopes the Ripple case will provide a hint or two as to what future compliance frameworks might look like. Adding to both optimism and uncertainty is the upcoming BRICS 2025 Summit scheduled for August 9–15 in Kazan, Russia. The summit’s agenda includes discussions on a new BRICS currency or settlement mechanism, a global de-dollarization strategy, and the integration of digital assets and blockchain-based financial infrastructures. The timing has naturally caught the attention of crypto analysts and investors, who wonder whether Ripple’s technology or XRP’s liquidity might reinforce some of the efforts. 3/ 🌍 BRICS 2025 Summit Road Rally: An Economic Power Shift?

In a post on X, he projected that with clear stablecoin rules and exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) approvals, the cryptocurrency could see returns as high as 33,233% in the next decade. Pantoja compared XRP’s current legal limbo to the early days of Bitcoin ( BTC ), noting that it took 8 years for it to stay above $1,000.

The crypto world is watching closely as the White House is set to release its first major crypto policy report on July 30. This is a big moment for the US crypto industry, as the report comes after a 180-day review under Executive Order 14178. It replaces older Biden-era rules and aims to bring a fresh and clearer approach under the Trump administration. The new rules could change how crypto is seen in the US and even influence other countries. The President’s Working Group on Digital Assets has completed the 180-day report. It will be released publicly on July 30th. America is now leading the way on digital asset policy — Bo Hines (@BoHines47) July 23, 2025 On the same day, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is expected to maintain its current interest rate range of 4.25%–4.50% on Wednesday. Any signs of a softer stance could spark another rally in cryptocurrencies and stocks. A new rulebook for crypto The report will focus on giving clear guidelines to crypto companies and investors. It will create a new structure for how US agencies like the Fed and FDIC handle crypto oversight. This means the days of confusion between the SEC and CFTC might be over. These changes follow the GENIUS Act , which was recently signed by Donald Trump. The goal is to create rules that don’t block innovation but still protect users. Stablecoins are getting major attention in the report. New rules may include licenses for stablecoin issuers, access to Federal Reserve payment systems, and stronger backing requirements for tokens pegged to the dollar. This move could push global adoption if the US treats stablecoins as real financial tools. On the flip side, the report might also call for a ban on central bank digital currencies, showing strong support for private crypto use. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why is the Crypto Market Going Down Today? , Bitcoin may become a national asset The most exciting part is the talk about a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve .

There’s also buzz about a national stockpile of other digital assets like XRP, which could change the game for altcoins. Crypto Impact This report could be a huge boost for the crypto market. Clearer rules will help companies grow and make it safer for regular people to invest. If Bitcoin becomes a strategic asset, it could trigger a big rally.

However, the RSI has exhausted itself and hit 82, which is an overheated stage in overbought territory. The curve retreated to 61, when writing with a slight halt in the LINK price rally. This price action suggests consolidation on $18 support in order to strengthen its bullish demand. If LINK continues to sustain without fail, then LINK might retest $24 in August. Such a move could signal a potential upward trend, increasing the chances of even flipping the fixed range high-volume profile level based on the $24 resistance level in Q3 and Q4. If LINK manages to surpass the $24 mark, projections for late 2025 suggest that the token could soar as high as $32. On the contrary, if LINK fails to hold on to $18, then $15 will be important support, followed by $13 next support.

2025-07-29T10:10:11,"Bitcoin Demand: The Crucial Shift as US Investors Await Lower Prices","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Demand: The Crucial Shift as US Investors Await Lower Prices Are you feeling the chill in the crypto air? Recent reports suggest a significant shift in the landscape of Bitcoin demand , particularly among investors in the United States. It appears a ‘wait-and-see’ approach is taking hold, with many anticipating a dip in prices before re-entering the market. This isn’t just a hunch; market indicators are painting a clear picture of this evolving sentiment. Understanding the Current State of Bitcoin Demand According to Arab Chain, a respected contributor at CryptoQuant, the appetite for Bitcoin (BTC) among U.S. investors has noticeably cooled. This observation isn’t just anecdotal; it’s backed by the behavior of key market indicators. For anyone tracking the pulse of the crypto market, understanding these shifts in Bitcoin demand is crucial for navigating potential price movements. The primary tool for gauging U.S. investor interest in Bitcoin is the Coinbase Bitcoin Premium Index. This index measures the price difference between BTC traded on Coinbase’s USD market and Binance’s USDT market. A positive premium indicates stronger buying pressure from U.S. investors, who typically use Coinbase for their USD-denominated trades. Conversely, a shrinking or negative premium suggests declining U.S. buying interest. The Coinbase Premium Index: A Key Indicator for Bitcoin Demand The Coinbase Bitcoin Premium Index has recently experienced a sharp decline. While it remains positive, its significant drop signals a clear change in investor behavior. Let’s break down what this index tells us about Bitcoin demand : Positive Premium: Historically, a strong positive premium has indicated robust U.S. buying pressure, often preceding or accompanying upward price movements. It means U.S. investors are willing to pay a slight premium for Bitcoin. Declining Premium: A sharp drop, even if still positive, suggests that U.S. investors are becoming less aggressive buyers. They are no longer eager to pay a premium, indicating a pause or a re-evaluation of their positions. Negative Premium: If the index were to dip into negative territory, it would signify that U.S. investors are actively selling or are completely disengaged from buying. This typically precedes or accompanies a market correction or prolonged consolidation. Historical Precedent: When U.S. Bitcoin Demand Surged History often provides valuable lessons, and the current situation is no exception. Arab Chain highlighted that U.S. Bitcoin demand historically surged when Bitcoin traded below $105,000. This period saw significant accumulation by U.S. investors, contributing to upward price momentum. What does this tell us? It suggests a psychological threshold or a perceived ‘fair value’ that U.S. investors are comfortable buying at. When prices are above this comfort zone, they tend to hold back, waiting for a more opportune entry point. This pattern underscores the importance of understanding investor psychology in driving market trends. What Drives Investor Caution? Factors Influencing Current Bitcoin Demand Several factors could be contributing to this cautious approach among U.S. investors, influencing overall Bitcoin demand : Factor Impact on Bitcoin Demand Macroeconomic Uncertainty High inflation, interest rate hikes, and recession fears can lead investors to de-risk, reducing speculative investments like crypto. Regulatory Environment Uncertainty or tightening regulations in the U.S. can make investors hesitant, fearing potential restrictions or market disruptions. Profit-Taking & Market Cycles After significant rallies, investors often take profits, leading to temporary dips in demand as they await new entry points. Halving Cycle Dynamics Post-halving, there’s often a period of consolidation before the next major bull run, leading to reduced immediate buying pressure. Geopolitical Tensions Global instability can prompt a flight to safety, but for some, it might mean reducing exposure to volatile assets like crypto. What Happens Next? Potential Scenarios for Bitcoin Demand The current state of Bitcoin demand sets the stage for several potential scenarios. Understanding these can help investors prepare: Continued Consolidation: If the Coinbase Premium Index continues to hover in low positive territory, it could signal a period of sideways trading, where Bitcoin’s price moves within a relatively narrow range. This ‘calm before the storm’ can be frustrating for traders but might offer accumulation opportunities for long-term holders. Market Correction: A move into negative territory for the premium index would strongly suggest a more significant market correction. This would imply U.S. investors are selling off their holdings, potentially leading to a sharper price decline. Resurgent Demand: Should Bitcoin’s price drop to a level perceived as attractive (e.g., closer to the historical $105,000 threshold or another significant support level), we could see a rapid resurgence in U.S. Bitcoin demand , driving prices back up. Actionable Insights for Navigating Shifting Bitcoin Demand In a market characterized by fluctuating Bitcoin demand , what should an investor do? Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Key Indicators: Keep a close eye on the Coinbase Bitcoin Premium Index and other on-chain metrics. These provide real-time insights into market sentiment and potential shifts in demand. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the bottom, consider implementing a DCA strategy. This involves investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, regardless of price, which can smooth out your average purchase price over time. Set Price Alerts: If you’re waiting for lower prices, set alerts at key support levels or psychological thresholds where you’d be comfortable re-entering the market. Diversify Your Portfolio: While Bitcoin is a cornerstone, a diversified crypto portfolio can help mitigate risks associated with the volatility of a single asset. Stay Informed: The crypto market is highly dynamic. Keep up-to-date with macroeconomic news, regulatory developments, and on-chain analysis to make informed decisions. The Challenges and Benefits of Patience in Bitcoin Demand The current market sentiment presents both challenges and potential benefits. The main challenge is the uncertainty and the psychological test of waiting while others might be buying or selling. It requires discipline to resist FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) or FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt). However, the benefits of patience can be substantial. By waiting for lower prices, investors can potentially achieve a better entry point, leading to higher returns when the market eventually recovers. It’s about strategic positioning rather than reactive trading. Understanding the underlying drivers of Bitcoin demand empowers you to make more calculated moves. The observed decline in U.S. Bitcoin demand , as evidenced by the Coinbase Bitcoin Premium Index, signals a period of cautious anticipation among investors. This ‘wait-and-see’ approach is a natural response to elevated prices and historical buying patterns. While it suggests potential for further consolidation or even a correction, it also highlights the strategic patience of investors aiming for more favorable entry points. The crypto market remains a dynamic arena, and staying informed about these crucial shifts in Bitcoin demand is paramount for making well-timed investment decisions. As the market evolves, understanding these nuances will be key to navigating its complexities and capitalizing on future opportunities. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Bitcoin Demand Q1: What is the Coinbase Bitcoin Premium Index and why is it important for understanding Bitcoin demand ? The Coinbase Bitcoin Premium Index measures the price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase’s USD market and Binance’s USDT market. It’s crucial because Coinbase is a primary on-ramp for U.S. institutional and retail investors using fiat currency. A positive premium indicates strong U.S. buying pressure, reflecting high Bitcoin demand from this key demographic, while a declining or negative premium suggests reduced interest. Q2: Does a decline in U.S. Bitcoin demand always lead to a price drop? Not necessarily immediately, but it often indicates a weakening of buying pressure that can lead to consolidation or a correction. While U.S. demand is significant, global demand and other factors also play a role. However, a sustained decline in U.S. Bitcoin demand typically signals a less bullish outlook for the short to medium term. Q3: What does it mean for U.S. investors to be ‘awaiting lower prices’? It means investors believe current Bitcoin prices are overvalued or too high for their comfort, and they are holding off on making new purchases. They are anticipating a market correction or a dip to more attractive price levels before they commit new capital, indicating a strategic patience in their approach to Bitcoin demand . Q4: How can individual investors track changes in Bitcoin demand ? Individual investors can track changes in Bitcoin demand by monitoring on-chain metrics like the Coinbase Bitcoin Premium Index (available on platforms like CryptoQuant), exchange inflows/outflows, stablecoin inflows, and trading volumes. Following reputable crypto analysts and news sources can also provide insights into market sentiment. Q5: Is this decline in Bitcoin demand a sign of a bear market? While a decline in U.S. Bitcoin demand can be a precursor to a market correction, it doesn’t automatically signal a full bear market. It could be a period of consolidation or a temporary pause before the next leg up. A bear market typically involves prolonged price depreciation, significant FUD, and a broader loss of confidence across the market. This specific indicator points to cautious sentiment rather than outright panic.

2025-07-29T10:05:52,"Ika Launches Mainnet to Enable Native Cross-Chain Asset Control on Sui Blockchain","July 29th, 2025 – Zug, Switzerland Ika , the pioneering blockchain infrastructure provider, has officially launched its mainnet, marking a significant milestone in blockchain interoperability. The launch introduces the first-ever zero-trust multiparty computation (MPC) network capable of native cross-chain asset control directly from smart contracts on the Sui blockchain. Ika’s protocol allows Sui-based smart contracts to securely and seamlessly manage native assets across many blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and modern L1s and L2s, without relying on bridges, token wrapping, or trusted third parties. This breakthrough eliminates common risks associated with cross-chain solutions, such as vulnerabilities inherent in bridging protocols or wrapped tokens, fundamentally transforming blockchain interoperability. At the heart of Ika’s innovation is the introduction of dWallets, a decentralized, programmable, and transferable signing mechanism. dWallets enable both the user and the Ika network to collaboratively sign transactions, while enforcing logic governed by smart contracts. This empowers developers and institutions to build and operate securely across various blockchains with native asset control. The technological core of Ika is its novel 2PC-MPC cryptography protocol, previously thought impractical for decentralized environments due to latency, scalability, and security constraints. Ika has overcome these hurdles, delivering sub-second latency and linear scalability, without compromising on decentralization, delivering a network that can be supported by hundreds of operators globally. Each operation includes cryptographic safeguards that require explicit user participation, supporting a zero-trust security framework. The network’s native token, IKA, plays a critical role by securing the infrastructure through a decentralized, permissionless proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. IKA tokens are integral for transaction fees, spam prevention, rewarding reliable operators, and network governance. Several leading blockchain projects on Sui are already utilizing Ika’s mainnet, demonstrating the protocol’s versatility and robustness: Native is enhancing Bitcoin liquidity through native lending and DeFi services. Human Tech delivers “Wallet-as-a-Protocol” solutions, seamlessly managing cross-chain assets. Rhei Finance offers institutional-grade zero-trust multi-chain DeFi services.

2025-07-29T10:05:00,"Ika Launches Mainnet to Enable Native Cross-Chain Asset Control on Sui Blockchain","Zug, Switzerland, July 29th, 2025, Chainwire Ika , the pioneering blockchain infrastructure provider, has officially launched its mainnet, marking a significant milestone in blockchain interoperability. The launch introduces the first-ever zero-trust multiparty computation (MPC) network capable of native cross-chain asset control directly from smart contracts on the Sui blockchain. Ika’s protocol allows Sui-based smart contracts to securely and seamlessly manage native assets across many blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and modern L1s and L2s, without relying on bridges, token wrapping, or trusted third parties. This breakthrough eliminates common risks associated with cross-chain solutions, such as vulnerabilities inherent in bridging protocols or wrapped tokens, fundamentally transforming blockchain interoperability. At the heart of Ika’s innovation is the introduction of dWallets, a decentralized, programmable, and transferable signing mechanism. dWallets enable both the user and the Ika network to collaboratively sign transactions, while enforcing logic governed by smart contracts. This empowers developers and institutions to build and operate securely across various blockchains with native asset control. The technological core of Ika is its novel 2PC-MPC cryptography protocol, previously thought impractical for decentralized environments due to latency, scalability, and security constraints. Ika has overcome these hurdles, delivering sub-second latency and linear scalability, without compromising on decentralization, delivering a network that can be supported by hundreds of operators globally. Each operation includes cryptographic safeguards that require explicit user participation, supporting a zero-trust security framework. The network’s native token, IKA, plays a critical role by securing the infrastructure through a decentralized, permissionless proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. IKA tokens are integral for transaction fees, spam prevention, rewarding reliable operators, and network governance.

2025-07-29T10:03:00,"Dogecoin (DOGE) Can Hit $0.50 In August, But Remittix (RTX) Is The Best Crypto To Buy Now For Huge Gains","After a recent retracement from its high in July, Dogecoin (DOGE) is starting to pick up again as crypto analysts predict a bullish shift to $0.50 as a short-term target. But while DOGE speculators are utterly focused on the meme token, which is fueled by perhaps another hype, serious traders and investors are positioning in something better – Remittix (RTX). Let’s talk DOGE first before we explore what Remittix is all about and why it’s a fundamentally stronger project that could do a 10x or more move by year-end. Can DOGE Actually Break $0.50 This Summer? Dogecoin has been on a tear this cycle, with renewed mainstream mentions and listings among top retail platforms, and many are now eyeing $0.50 as a possible milestone by August. Traders point to bullish patterns in Dogecoin’s price on the weekly chart and increasing sentiment on crypto forums and social channels. If Bitcoin breaks out of the current range to the upside and capital rotates into meme coins, DOGE could spike. Still, technical resistance between $0.45 and $0.50 will be challenging if retail enthusiasm fades or meme hype loses steam. Why Remittix (RTX) Could Be the Better Play Now While DOGE rides the meme wave, investors looking for outsized gains are turning to Remittix (RTX), a project built for practical impact, not just social media chatter. Real-world remittance model: Remittix addresses a massive global need: low-cost, near-instant cross-border payments, which the legacy systems have failed to address. Growth-driven tokenomics: Since real-use cases back RTX, its price is expected to be sustainable, thereby driving long-term investor confidence. What’s more, there’s an ongoing $250,000 crypto giveaway. Token success and surging adoption: Remittix has raised over $17.5 million, and adoption continues to widen with new partnership rollouts and a polished user interface. Whales are quietly building positions, and smarter capital is betting on long-term upside, not short-lived hype. Better risk-to-reward profile: DOGE might return 2× from $0.25, but speculative sentiment can fade fast. In contrast, RTX offers potential 10× 50× gains, especially for early stakeholders riding behind tangible product development. Also, Dogecoin wins when it comes to brand recognition and cultural relevance. Elon Musk’s tweets can still send it soaring, and the community is as passionate as ever. But for investors looking for solid fundamentals and actual use cases, Remittix offers far more upside, particularly in a market cycle that’s starting to reward utility over memes. So, if you’re chasing short-term meme gains, Dogecoin price might still move toward $0.50 this summer, with volatility and quick exits in mind. But if you’re looking for longer-term growth paired with real utility, Remittix makes a strong case.

2025-07-29T10:00:55,"Bitcoin Is A Lifeline, Says Billionaire, As US Faces Debt Time Bomb","Ray Dalio, the billionaire behind Bridgewater Associates, says people should think about putting 15% of their money into gold or Bitcoin. His call comes as America’s debt nears the $37 trillion mark. He argues that holding hard assets can help when paper money loses value. Related Reading: Countdown To August 15: What XRP Investors Need To Know “If you were optimizing your portfolio for the best return-to-risk ratio, you would have around 15% of your money in Bitcoin or gold,” Dalio said during the Master Investor podcast this week. Dalio admits he owns only a little Bitcoin and still leans toward gold. But he’s clear that splitting that 15% between the two is up to each investor. Optimizing For A Debt‑Strained Dollar According to Dalio, the US government will need to sell about $12 trillion more in treasuries over the next year to deal with its growing bill. He pointed out that recent Treasury data shows borrowing in the third quarter of 2025 could hit $1 trillion—$453 billion above earlier estimates—and another $590 billion in the fourth quarter. He warns that printing or selling more debt tends to weaken a currency. That’s why gold and Bitcoin, which aren’t tied to any central bank’s balance sheet, can act as buffers against plain old dollars. Balancing Gold And Bitcoin Dalio said gold remains his go‑to choice. It has centuries of track record against inflation and crisis. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is newer and can swing wildly in price. It’s trading around $118,862, roughly 4% below its July 14 all‑time high of $123,250. While its ups and downs can add spice to returns, they can also give some investors sleepless nights. Dalio suggests you pick a mix that feels right. If you hate big price moves, tilt toward gold. If you can stomach Bitcoin’s roller‑coaster, you might give it a bigger slice. Midway Through The Conversation On Risk He raised the idea back in January 2022 with 1% to 2% in Bitcoin. Now he’s tripling that bucket. That jump shows how fast the mood can shift when national debt climbs. Dalio noted that other Western nations like the United Kingdom face the same “debt doom loop” he sees in the US. He said their currencies may lag behind hard assets, making gold and Bitcoin effective diversifiers when government bills keep piling up. Related Reading: Memecoins, NFTs Get Called Out By Their Own Architect: ‘Zero Intrinsic Value’ Role Of Reserve Currencies Despite his nod to Bitcoin, Dalio said it won’t replace the dollar or euro for central banks. He argued that public blockchains lack privacy. Every transaction is visible, so governments could still watch and intervene. Gold, in contrast, can change hands in private after it leaves the vault. That gives it an edge when you want to keep your holdings off the radar.

2025-07-29T10:00:41,"Forget $1: Dogecoin Eyes Rise To $10 If It Follows This Path","The expectations for the Dogecoin price to hit as high as $1 this cycle remain high, especially as DOGE has managed to maintain its position as the leading meme coin in the space. This continues despite the meme coin being unable to reclaim its $0.7 all-time high from 2021. Nevertheless, it has not deterred the bulls from predicting that $1 is inevitable this cycle, as many analysts have even predicted that it will jump higher than this by the time the bull run is over. Why Dogecoin Can Rise To $10 Crypto analyst XForceGlobal recently published an analysis showing the Dogecoin price path and where the meme coin could be headed from here. Unlike some who believe that the bull run is over for the meme coin, XForceGlobal predicts that it is destined to rise higher from its current level. The analysis came with both a conservative point of view and a much more ambitious forecast that could see the Dogecoin price hit double-digits . Going with the more conservative prediction, the crypto analyst predicts that Dogecoin could see an initial rise to the $0.65 level, followed by a decline, before rising above the $1 level. Thus, in this scenario, the crypto analyst believes that Dogecoin has the opportunity to rally at 2x-3x before the wave is over. Then moving on to the more ambitious target , the analyst shows an at least 5x surge that will first push its price above the coveted $1 level. However, it will not end there. In a total of five waves, the Elliot Wave certified analyst puts the Dogecoin price above $10, expecting it to reach as high as $16 if this plays out as expected. As to why Dogecoin could see such an insane rally, the crypto analyst explains that DOGE has proven to be a resilient legacy coin. In a market where there are thousands of altcoins, XForceGlobal explains that while the altcoins will rise, finding those like Dogecoin that have the opportunity to rise higher is the most important. Analysts Are Bullish On DOGE Another crypto analyst who has predicted that the Dogecoin price could cross the $10 level is DOGECAPITAL. According to a report from NewsBTC , the analyst believes that if the DOGE price does follow the previous cycles using the Fibonacci tool, then the meme coin is destined to cross $10. Additionally, crypto analyst Dima James Potts has been one of the most vocal voices for Dogecoin price reaching the $10 level. This call has been made by the analyst months ago, and like DOGECAPITAL, he points to the historical performance of Dogecoin to forecast why its price could beat $10 this time.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-eyes-rise-to-10/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX|COMMODITY|ONDO|ENA|GALA","Dogecoin|crypto|crypto news|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt",cryptocompare

The move comes roughly a year after President Donald Trump called for all remaining bitcoin to be “made in the U.S. ” Bitmain has long dominated the market for specialized cryptocurrency mining hardware. That dominance has been threatened by growing U.S. scrutiny of Chinese tech firms and supply disruptions triggered by escalating trade tensions and tariff threats. Opening a U.S. plant could speed up deliveries and repairs for customers in the country, Gao said, adding that while labor costs are higher, the move still makes commercial sense. Heightened scrutiny from U.S. Customs and Border Protection has delayed mining equipment shipments, and the U.S. Commerce Department has blacklisted Sophgo, an artificial intelligence firm linked to Bitmain, accusing it of “acting at the behest of Beijing to further the PRC’s goals of indigenous advanced chip production,” referring to the People's Republic of China. Bitcoin mining was historically dominant in China given the low energy costs miners could leverage in the country. After the practice was banned there in 2021 , the U.S. became a prominent crypto mining hub, with American crypto miners like MARA Holdings (MARA) and CleanSpark (CLSK) now being publicly traded. Still, Bitmain’s U.S. move faces obstacles, including regulatory scrutiny and uncertainty over whether crypto hardware like ASIC miners will be subject to the same export rules as AI chips. The company started a bitcoin mining farm in rural Texas back in 2019, taking advantage of low energy costs in the region.
