2025-07-29T09:48:00,"Bitcoin (BTC) Breakout Looms: Is a Massive Surge Coming Soon?","The Bitcoin price is approaching the top of its bull flag once again. Will there be a definitive breakout? If the breakout is weak, or if it fails to happen, could this be the beginning of the end for this current bull market cycle? A changing Bitcoin cycle? If Bitcoin is to make this current bull market cycle one of the more successful ones, the price is going to need to break out soon. On the other hand, some analysts believe that the typical 4-year cycle is changing, and that the sheer amount of institutional money entering the Bitcoin space will push the end of the cycle out to Q1 or Q2 of 2026. If this is going to be the case, the Bitcoin price would have plenty of time for more consolidation before heading into the final phase. However, if we are still in the 4-year cycle, the clock is starting to run down, with only three or four months left before a potential blow-off top at some time in November perhaps? A huge turnaround in the U.S. stock market Source: TradingView On the macro side of things there are positives for Bitcoin. Recent huge trade deals have been agreed with Japan and the EU, which have led to renewed optimism in the U.S. stock market. The chart above of the S&P 500 shows the most incredible turn around from the depths of pessimism over the Trump tariffs, to the record-breaking surge that is currently being experienced. It’s in this kind of environment that Bitcoin can generally be expected to surge. Therefore, it is possibly just a matter of time before Bitcoin embarks on another strong rally to the upside. Shallow rejection for $BTC? Source: TradingView The short-term price chart for $BTC reveals that the price was rejected at the top of the bull flag once again. However, the correctional impulse has so far been rather shallow, only descending as far as the important $118,000 horizontal support. From there, the price has bounced back and is once more flirting with the upper trendline of the bull flag. Will there be a breakout from here? It is entirely possible. All shorter term Stochastic RSI indicators have a way to go before reaching their tops, so momentum is still with the $BTC price. Flag or ascending triangle? Source: TradingView As one zooms further out into the daily time frame, the bull flag becomes less reliable as a pattern, with candle wicks rather than candle bodies unsatisfactorily forming some of the touch points. Therefore, there is the possibility of other patterns becoming valid. The chart above shows an ascending triangle pattern, which keeps the touch points to the candle bodies. If this is a valid pattern, it would be a very bullish one. The Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart has the indicators now angled back to the upside. This would also tend to suggest that positive price action is likely to follow. Probabilities of more upside price action Source: TradingView The weekly time frame illustrates that whatever the candle pattern is, it does have the sideways movement of a continuation formation. Also, given that this pattern is smaller than previous ones, it is far more likely to break out sooner. Moving down the chart, the Stochastic RSI on this time frame has the indicator lines shaping to cross back down, while at the bottom of the chart, the RSI indicator line may have a bullish bounce from the ascending yellow moving average line. Predicting price movements is a very uncertain art. All the price action and indicators can do is to give hints on probabilities of future price direction. Fundamentally, it does look as though the direction for Bitcoin should be up, but technically this is still uncertain. That said, the probability is of more upward price action rather than downside.

Additionally, with a finite cap of 84 million coins, LTC presents itself as a potential investment for value preservation, akin to Bitcoin’s role as a digital asset. Why is the LTC price down today?

Litecoin price prediction July 2025 Litecoin’s price shows signs of bullish moves as it has been surging toward $100. However, as BTC’s price aims for a hold above the $110K mark in July, Litecoin’s price intends to end this month on a bullish note.

2025-07-29T09:35:09,"The Company Led by Ethereum Co-Founder Joe Lubin Announces It Will Acquire Ethereum! Here Are the Details","Joe Lubin, one of the founders of Ethereum, announced that SharpLink Gaming, which he leads, aims to accumulate Ethereum (ETH) as quickly as possible. SharpLink's Joe Lubin: “We Will Be the Fastest to Collect Ethereum” With this aggressive strategy, the company aims to get ahead of its competitors in the race for institutional Ethereum treasury. Lubin said in an interview: “In terms of fully diluted Ethereum per share accumulation, we will be the fastest progressing among Ethereum-focused projects, and even Bitcoin-focused ones if we include them.” SharpLink Gaming is growing its Ethereum reserves by raising capital daily through at-the-market financing methods. The company also invests its existing ETH holdings through staking, aiming to multiply its position by reinvesting these returns. Joe Lubin is also known as the CEO of Ethereum infrastructure company ConsenSys and one of the eight founding members of Ethereum. SharpLink currently sits in second place with 360,800 ETH (approximately $1.35 billion). Tom Lee's BitMine Immersion Technologies holds the top spot, which holds 566,800 ETH (approximately $2.13 billion). Other names in the top five for ETH holdings include the Ethereum Foundation, The Ether Machine, and PulseChain. Larger players like Coinbase, Bit Digital, and the Golem Foundation also hold over 100,000 ETH. The race to accumulate ETH is believed to be putting upward pressure on Ethereum's price. Behind assets like Bitcoin and Solana, ETH has surged 110% to $3,800 in the last three months. Most of its competitors have had to settle for double-digit gains during the same period. Crypto security analyst Wilson Ye stated the following in a post on social media platform X: “What we're seeing is institutional-scale FOMO (fear of missing out). Large players are racing to gain dominant positions ahead of ETF approvals. This competition validates the thesis that ETH is becoming institutional infrastructure.” SharpLink states that it will adopt a cautious approach to leverage. The company currently has no debt, but is reportedly evaluating new financing options such as issuing convertible bonds. This was a strategy MicroStrategy frequently used in its Bitcoin holdings. Joe Lubin added the following on the subject: “Whatever we do, we will carefully manage risk levels. We will always keep leverage under control.” Lubin stated that this cautious approach will provide significant benefits to shareholders in the long run. SharpLink’s aggressive but controlled Ethereum strategy consolidates ETH’s position in the corporate world, while also signaling the start of a new accumulation race in the market. *This is not investment advice.

Pseudonymous analyst Rekt Capital tells his 553,600 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin needed a weekly candle close above $119,200 to trigger a breakout from a bullish continuation pattern. With BTC closing the previous week at around $119,400, the analyst says Bitcoin is now in the process of flipping the resistance level into support and that breakout rallies are in sight. “Bitcoin did it. Bitcoin Weekly Closed above the ~$119,200 Bull Flag Top and is now in the process of retesting it to fully confirm the breakout. Downside wicking is possible on this retest, as long as the Bull Flag Top is maintained as support.” Source: Rekt Capital/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $118,183. Another crypto asset that had a strong weekly close is the memecoin Pudgy Penguins ( PENGU ), according to the trader. While Rekt says the altcoin looks strong, he notes that it needs to flash signs of sustained momentum to invalidate a bearish divergence on the daily chart. A bearish divergence is a reversal signal, suggesting that momentum is waning for an asset after a move up. “Pudgy Penguins has performed its highest ever Weekly Close, doing so above its final major Weekly resistance (blue). Retesting the $0.04 old resistance (blue) into new support would confirm a successful post-breakout retest. While the positioning is favourable, there are mounting Bearish Divergences on the Daily that PENGU will need to soon invalidate for stronger bull bias.” Source: Rekt Capital/X At time of writing, PENGU is worth $0.041.

2025-07-29T09:14:59,"DOJ pursues $2.3M in Bitcoin recovered from a suspected ‘Chaos’ ransomware operator","Federal prosecutors have launched a forfeiture action to claim $2.3 million in Bitcoin allegedly tied to a ransomware actor from the newly identified Chaos group. According to a July 28 press release from the US Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Texas, the Department of Justice filed a civil complaint seeking the forfeiture of approximately 20.3 Bitcoin. The FBI’s Dallas Division originally seized the Bitcoin in question in mid-April from a wallet linked to an individual known as “Hors,” who is alleged to be a member of the Chaos ransomware group. Authorities claim the funds are connected to schemes that targeted victims in the Northern District of Texas and other regions, and constitute property involved in or derived from “unlawful activity, including money laundering and extortion” related to ransomware attacks. Law enforcement reportedly accessed the wallet using a recovery seed phrase associated with Electrum, an older Bitcoin wallet platform. However, the government has not disclosed how the seed phrase was obtained. According to court documents, federal agents successfully transferred the seized funds to a government-controlled address. At the time of the seizure in April, the Bitcoin was worth approximately $1.7 million. By the time the complaint was filed in late July, the value had increased to over $2.4 million. New entrant in the ransomware market Chaos is a newly identified ransomware-as-a-service operation that has been active since at least February 2025. The group was first documented by cybersecurity firm Cisco Talos, which has warned of its cross-platform capabilities that allow it to target systems running Windows, Linux, ESXi, and NAS systems. Like other RaaS models, Chaos licenses its malware to affiliates in exchange for a share of the ransom payments. Victims are typically pressured into paying in cryptocurrency to regain access to encrypted files or to prevent the public release of stolen data. Despite sharing its name with a well-known ransomware builder, Chaos appears to be a separate group entirely. Researchers believe the threat actors behind the ransomware campaign may be intentionally leveraging the name to obscure attribution and make tracking efforts more difficult. The alias “Hors” is believed to represent one of several active participants using the Chaos platform. A busy month for the DOJ Earlier this month, the DOJ filed a similar civil forfeiture action to recover more than $7 million in cryptocurrency seized by Homeland Security as part of an investigation into a $97 million oil and gas investment scam. The funds were allegedly laundered through wallets linked to suspects in Russia and Nigeria and routed through offshore exchanges. Also in July, the DOJ disclosed that it had collaborated with Tether to recover $40,300 in USDT linked to a phishing scam that impersonated the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee.

2025-07-29T09:09:23,"Market Watch: Bitcoin Steady at $119K as Altcoins Pull Back","Bitcoin’s price actions have remained relatively still on a 24-hour scale as the asset continues to trade around $119,000. At the same time, many altcoins have posted notable price retracements, such as SUI, which is down by 6%, and PEPE. BTC Calms at $119K Driven mostly by a significant sell-off initiated by Galaxy Digital for a third-party for 80,000 BTC, the primary cryptocurrency’s price slumped hard last Thursday and Friday and bottomed at a two-week low of $114,500. After the sale was completed, it quickly started to recover some traction and jumped to its familiar range of around $117,000 during the weekend. The bulls went on the offensive on Monday morning, pushing BTC higher to almost $120,000 . However, another rejection took place at that persistent resistance, and bitcoin slipped to $117,500 hours later. It has managed to recover some ground and is now close to $119,000, which brings the 24-hour movement to almost 0%. Nevertheless, more volatility is expected in the next couple of days as the US Federal Reserve is set to meet to discuss whether it will finally cut the interest rates or will it continue without a pivot. For now, BTC’s market cap has remained at $2.365 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts has taken a breather and is above 59%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts in Retreat Most altcoins were charting notable gains over the past several days, and expectedly, have retraced now. Some of the most painful ones come from PEPE, AVAX, and SUI, but ENA leads with a massive 10% daily plunge. XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, ADA , LINK, and XLM are also in the red, while ETH has remained close to $3,900 amid substantial demand for the Ethereum ETFs. TRX and HYPE are among the few altcoins in the green today. The total crypto market cap jumped to roughly $4.050 trillion on CG yesterday, but has lost over $50 billion since then and is currently just below the $4 trillion mark.

Texas (@NDTXnews) July 28, 2025 The action comes amid massive law enforcement success in tracking and seizing cryptocurrency linked to cybercrime. Federal agencies have recovered billions in digital assets from ransomware groups, dark web marketplaces, and international fraud networks over the past year. Recent major seizures include $225.3 million in USDT tied to pig butchering investment scams, $31 million from the 2021 Uranium Finance hack, and $24 million from Russian national Rustam Gallyamov linked to Qakbot malware operations. The DOJ has indicated that seized cryptocurrency assets may contribute to President Trump’s proposed Strategic Bitcoin Reserve rather than being sold at auction. Global Enforcement Surge Targets Billion-Dollar Crypto Crime Networks Law enforcement agencies have achieved significant success in dismantling cryptocurrency-based criminal enterprises, with international operations resulting in the seizure of billions of dollars’ worth of digital assets. Operation SpecTor alone targeted dark web drug markets , resulting in 270 arrests and confiscation of over two metric tons of drugs alongside $200 million in cryptocurrency across nine countries. In February, the DOJ seized $31 million in cryptocurrency linked to the 2021 Uranium Finance hack , following nearly four years of investigation.

Similarly, in May, federal prosecutors charged Rustam Gallyamov, a Russian national accused of developing Qakbot malware since 2008, with seizing over $24 million in Bitcoin and stablecoins . The malware infected thousands of computers worldwide, creating botnets used for ransomware deployment by groups including REvil, Conti, and Black Basta. Most recently, the BidenCash dark web marketplace generated $17 million in revenue by selling over 15 million stolen credit cards before authorities seized 145 associated domains. The operation led by the US Secret Service and the FBI involved international partners, including the Dutch National Police. International cooperation has expanded enforcement reach, with authorities in nine countries participating in major takedowns.

Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Plans Transform Seized Asset Policy President Trump’s executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has fundamentally altered the government’s approach to seized cryptocurrency assets. The reserve will utilize approximately 200,000 Bitcoin previously confiscated through law enforcement operations rather than selling assets at auction. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan argues the reserve eliminates the final existential threat to Bitcoin by removing fears of government prohibition. @BitwiseInvest CIO @Matt_Hougan believes @realDonaldTrump 's executive order to establish a Bitcoin Reserve has eliminated the final major threat to Bitcoin’s viability. #Trump #Bitcoin https://t.co/whCYlgRrzY — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 26, 2025 The policy shift means future seizures may contribute to national cryptocurrency holdings rather than generating immediate revenue through sales. Previously, the DOJ received approval to sell 69,370 Bitcoins, worth approximately $6.5 billion, seized from the Silk Road . However, the new administration’s reserve policy may redirect such assets. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick are exploring budget-neutral acquisition strategies using surplus funds. Approximately 103,500 Bitcoins are expected to remain in long-term government custody, while 94,636 Bitcoins from the Bitfinex hack will be returned to the victims of the crime.

2025-07-29T09:03:15,"DeFi Hits $153B as ETH Soars and Restaking Booms","The decentralized finance (DeFi) sector has climbed to a three-year high of $153 billion , driven by Ethereum’s price nearing $4,000 and a flood of capital into restaking platforms. This marks its strongest performance since May 2022, when the Terra collapse sent shockwaves through the market. According to DefiLlama, Ethereum dominates with nearly 60% of DeFi’s total value locked (TVL) , mainly through Lido and Aave, which together hold over $60 billion. ETH itself has jumped 60% in the past month thanks to heavy institutional investment, including Sharplink Gaming and BitMine’s multibillion-dollar moves. Restaking has added another layer of opportunity, letting users earn both base staking rewards and additional yield through liquid tokens. Some strategies—like looping USDC and sUSDC across Euler and Spark—are now delivering returns as high as 25% , though these may only last while current incentives remain. Beyond Ethereum, Solana’s DeFi scene is also heating up with a 23% increase in TVL, led by projects like Sanctum and Jupiter. Avalanche and Sui are seeing even stronger growth, up 33% and 39% respectively, while Bitcoin’s DeFi momentum is slower at 9%, despite BTC’s price reaching new highs.",coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/defi-hits-3-year-high,"ETH|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|SOL","",cryptocompare

2025-07-29T09:00:08,"Expect A New Bitcoin Price Rally: Analyst Connects M2 Lag To $130,000 Target","As the Bitcoin price hovers just 4% below its all-time high of $123,000, crypto analyst Doctor Profit has issued a new report that could spark increased bullish sentiment among investors, suggesting that a new rally could be on the horizon. Bitcoin Price Poised For Growth After Major Trade Deal In a recent post on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Doctor Profit highlighted a significant technical development for the Bitcoin price, noting that the cryptocurrency has recently broken through a diagonal resistance line on its monthly chart—a barrier that had proven insurmountable for several months. According to the analyst, the Bitcoin price faced repeated rejections at this crucial resistance level from November 2024 through February 2025. However, this month marked a decisive breakout for the cryptocurrency, followed by a successful retest of the $114,000 level last Friday and a “strong bullish impulse” forming. Related Reading: Memecoins, NFTs Get Called Out By Their Own Architect: ‘Zero Intrinsic Value’ Doctor Profit emphasized that this breakthrough signals a potential upward movement, asserting that the market is primed for the next leg up. He even predicts that the “bullish chart” will soon dominate discussions across social media. Adding to this optimism are recent developments surrounding a US-Europe trade deal announced on Monday by the White House. Doctor Profit noted that tariffs have been a lingering concern for both the Bitcoin price and the broader stock market, suppressing momentum. However, the analyst asserts that the announcement of a new trade agreement—valued at $750 billion in US energy exports and $600 billion in EU investments—has alleviated some of that pressure. Links Between M2 Money Supply And BTC’s Potential On a macroeconomic level, Doctor Profit highlighted the M2 money supply as a crucial factor influencing the Bitcoin price trajectory. Following a 25% expansion of M2 in 2020 due to pandemic-related measures, Bitcoin experienced an 800% rally. Currently, M2 has increased by 2.3% since the beginning of 2025, despite ongoing quantitative tightening measures by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The analyst believes that this indicates that the Fed may be poised to adopt more aggressive monetary policies in the near future. Related Reading: Ethereum Is About To Breakout Of Massive Consolidation Toward $5,000 Historical data suggests a correlation between increases in M2 and Bitcoin price movements, with the analyst estimating a potential upside of 30-35% for Bitcoin with every 1% increase in M2. The most significant expansion has occurred in recent months, particularly between May and June 2025, when M2 saw a monthly increase of 0.63%. Given Bitcoin’s typical lag in response to M2 changes—approximately 60 to 90 days—there is speculation that this could lead to a 15-17.5% rally in the coming weeks, positioning Bitcoin toward the $130,000 mark. Looking ahead, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting is slated for Wednesday, with a strong expectation of no interest rate cuts. As of this writing, the market’s leading cryptocurrency trades at $117,569, up nearly 71% on a year-to-date (YTD) basis.
