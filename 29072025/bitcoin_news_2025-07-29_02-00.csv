2025-07-28T23:49:56,"Trump Media’s Bitcoin ETF in limbo as SEC extends review timeline to September","The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed the approval of the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF. A ruling, which had previously been anticipated in July, has been postponed until September 18, 2025, according to an official filing issued on Monday. The ETF is linked to Truth Social, the social media app closely associated with President Donald Trump, who is also an active user on the platform. Trump Media submitted their ETF application in June , positioning them to be one of the early entrants into the rapidly growing digital asset investment space. “The Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein,” added the SEC in the letter. The delay means investors and analysts will wait at least two months before determining whether regulators approve a Bitcoin ETF linked to a politically charged brand. The fund would let small-dollar investors of the traditional variety gain access to Bitcoin as they buy shares on regular stock exchanges, without holding the cryptocurrency itself. If approved, the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF would only solidify Trump’s burgeoning sway in the crypto world. It would also add a politically branded fund to a category already setting records for investor demand . Approved crypto ETFs thrive as others face delays Since the beginning of the year, the SEC has green-lighted 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs, unleashing a wave of traditional investor access to the digital currency. Together, the ETFs have pulled in over $54.8 billion , making them one of the most successful U.S. ETF launches ever. Riding the wave, the SEC also approved Ethereum ETFs, solidifying crypto’s position in the pantheon of traditional finance. But other approvals have been more sluggish. The SEC remains cautious in considering ETFs for other digital assets such as Solana, Cardano, and Dogecoin. The SEC also delayed its decision on the Grayscale Solana Trust ETF on the same day it delayed the Truth Social ETF. The justices are now likely to issue a ruling by October 10. A handful of asset managers, including VanEck, Bitwise, 21Shares, and Canary, are vying for approval of their Solana-tethered ETFs. It’s not unusual for a cryptocurrency ETF decision to be delayed. The law allows the SEC as much as 240 days to make a final decision, during which it will weigh factors, including market stability, investor protection, custody arrangements, and susceptibility to market manipulation. Trump pushes pro-crypto agenda Once a crypto skeptic, Donald Trump has recently emerged as a high-profile technology booster. In the past few months, he has consistently expressed support for the crypto industry. He has also vowed to establish the United States as the global “crypto capital” and to cut regulatory red tape for digital assets. In a bold decision, Trump also selected long-time crypto supporter Paul Atkins as Chair of the SEC. Under Atkins, the Commission has reportedly been more open to crypto innovation, but cautiousness around altcoin products and politically affiliated initiatives like the Truth Social ETF still reigns. The president’s crypto ties are expanding. His name is linked to meme coins like TRUMP and MAGA, and his family is affiliated with a decentralized finance (DeFi) project called World Liberty Financial . Since Trump took office in January, the SEC has witnessed a significant boost in interest in ETF products tied to cryptocurrencies, everything from serious institutional products down to highly speculative altcoin funds. Still, regulatory oversight remains firm. Whilst the Trump-SEC has made strides in embracing the wider crypto-sphere, investor protection remains a top priority for the Commission. In the meantime, we can call a time-out on Trump Media’s Bitcoin ETF, frozen in a broader debate over how fast the U.S. should adopt digital assets. The September decision could become a turning point for politically sponsored crypto finance or bolster the SEC’s hesitancy. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-07-28T23:40:00,"Bitcoin price prediction 2025-2031: Will BTC hit $150k soon?","Key takeaways: Bitcoin price faces volatility around $119K. Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction.

BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $114,747, beginning a bearish trend to $110,596. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bitcoin faced a surge in bullish pressure as buyers accumulated heavily around recent lows. However, this triggered a profit-taking sentiment around recent highs, resulting in a decline. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $120K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Bitcoin ETF volume is on a rising trend, recording $102.14 million in daily total net inflows on June 30, marking day 15 of a gigantic inflow streak that now totals $4.73 billion. It also marks the third consecutive month of total net inflows totaling $12.8 billion since April. Bitcoin price prediction July 2025 Bitcoin’s price jumped to $109,000, making Q2 its best quarter since 2020. In the second quarter of 2025 alone, it went up by 31%, showing strong market activity and growing investor trust. This rise is partly because, in the past, Bitcoin has often grown a lot after its “halving” events. Analysts think the current market is following the same pattern, which could mean we’ll see a peak around September 2025. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $105,000 and be pushed further, at least $113,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $101,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction July 2025 $101,000 $105,000 $113,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 $68,000 $120,000 $160,000 Bitcoin Price Predictions 2026-2031 Year Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price 2026 $115,000 $130,000 $185,000 2027 $140,491 $170,100 $216,738 2028 $164,063 $185,068 $244,142 2029 $195,629 $200,312 $255,321 2030 $225,903 $248,568 $270,593 2031 $285,058 $303,555 $350,548 Bitcoin price prediction 2026 Bitcoin might witness slow growth after 2025’s halving surge, resulting in a surge in selling pressure. However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491.

Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-price-prediction/,"REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|UNI|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT","Crypto Price Predictions|BTC",cryptocompare
