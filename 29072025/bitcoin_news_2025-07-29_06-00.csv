While Bitcoin is staying close to its recent highs, many altcoins are under heavy selling pressure. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what‚Äôs causing the sudden crash. Altcoins are taking the biggest hit. Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $3,779.85, slipping 2.53% in the last day. XRP has dropped 4% in a day, even though it remains up over 10% for the week, currently priced at $3.12. Solana (SOL) and BNB are both down over 2.4% daily. Cardano (ADA), priced at $0.7878, is down 6.17% in 24 hours and has lost 10.81% over the week. Dogecoin (DOGE) has also taken a sharp hit, down 7.64% today. Similarly, Sui (SUI) has tumbled 8.30% today. Overall, the market‚Äôs red zone performance shows investor reaction, profit-taking after recent rallies, and pressure from ongoing regulatory uncertainties. Reasons Behind The Recent Crash One of the reasons for the pullback may be the U.S. SEC‚Äôs decision to pause approval of new spot ETFs for altcoins. While Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have been given the green light, altcoin ETFs are still in limbo. Experts and traders had expected the altcoin ETF approval to come soon, hoping it would bring in fresh money and drive prices up. But now, with no clear timeline, investors are stepping back and choosing to wait, creating panic selling in altcoin markets. Additionally, many altcoins have doubled or even tripled in value over the past few months. Now that Bitcoin is consolidating near its $120,000 resistance level, traders are moving their profits from altcoins back into Bitcoin, which is seen as a ‚Äúsafer‚Äù asset. This rotation of money is pushing altcoin prices down even further.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-is-the-crypto-market-crashing-today-3/,"MARKET|ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|ADA","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-07-29T03:40:35,"Web 3.0 Founders Must Learn From AI Industry Success","HodlX Guest Post Submit Your Post Discords and X threads aren‚Äôt fooling investors anymore. Web 3.0 founders must look towards AI to survive. Web 3.0 founders have to pivot. The AI (artificial intelligence) industry has demonstrated itself to be far more apt at innovating than Web 3.0, which as an industry must accept defeat in a way and reorganize. It would behoove AI founders to take a page out of the book of big AI companies, which have impacted lives and scooped up a big market share in short order ‚Äì leaving crypto very much in the dust when it comes to the mindshare of crypto in the global consciousness versus AI. Web 3.0 founders must ask themselves, ‚ÄòWhat can we learn?‚Äô As AI becomes more powerful, and it will do so quickly, Web 3.0 will quickly become a subservient industry, dependent upon the whims of the almighty big technology corporations in control of AI technology. Web 3.0 will likely only become lucrative and impactful by partnering with AI companies. Web 3.0‚Äôs decentralization, which has resulted in thousands of projects promising all sorts of decentralized versions of apps that already exist, has led to the general public ‚Äì including investors ‚Äì not understanding which projects are for real. Investors simply don‚Äôt know which projects can achieve results or are even offering a solution to a real problem. DAOs, DeFi protocols and metaverse land rushes are largely a cacophony of Discord servers, Telegram groups and X threads. For many Western investors, these business models are completely foreign. The business models of AI companies, including startups, are far more familiar. In addition, Web 3.0 has gained a bit of a reputation for being associated with hype and scams. The AI industry, on the other hand, has forged a clearer path towards deals that make a difference. AI companies aren‚Äôt shilling tokens based on future promises, writing convoluted whitepapers and posting endlessly online. They‚Äôre building groundbreaking technology from the ground up. In the AI industry, the cream has risen quickly to the top. The world knows that it is companies like xAI, OpenAI, Google and others that dominate the marketplace. Investors know that real innovation doesn‚Äôt come from a 10,000 NFT (non-fungible token) collection. BlackRock will tokenize bonds, not NFTs. Partners want to make deals with the AI behemoths building out the world-changing infrastructure, such as cloud providers, chipmakers or platforms like xAI‚Äôs Grok, which has revolutionized the way in which humanity seeks out information. Unfortunately for those of us in the Web 3.0 space ‚Äì for now at least ‚Äì these companies are building the future, not Web 3.0 startups. Centralization is winning the day over decentralization. The fragmentation in Web 3.0 ‚Äì the fierce competition over so little ‚Äì i s not nearly as appetizing to investors and strategic partners as AI monopolies. Web 3.0 companies should start looking to partner with those companies sitting on a vast GPU supply or a proprietary data organization. These are the companies ‚Äì t he ones that control algorithms ‚Äì getting inventor funds. A new way forward for crypto Web 3.0 founders are left with no other option than to pivot. The industry has to face it and move towards a new strategy. Big money has found it difficult to navigate the decentralized web of Web 3.0 companies. Instead, centralized powerhouses are the ones building the future, and they could step into the crypto arena at any time and potentially outcompete crypto native incumbents. It‚Äôs time for crypto to move on from its messaging chat and X strategy, as well as the promises of decentralization, and start working the phones to get into the boardrooms of Fortune 500 companies touching technology. It‚Äôs high time to deliver. The idealism of Web 3.0 is proving not to mesh with reality. The quest for decentralization, ownership and democratized value creation has stalled. In the future, Web 3.0 might further fragment. The biggest blockchains, such as Ethereum and Solana, will begin to pin their fates on centralized solutions, increasingly looking like the tech gatekeepers they once billed themselves as disrupting. The blockchains of tomorrow will exist as integrations into the traditional financial and technology giants, which are looking for supply chain tracking and similar solutions. For the blockchain world, these solutions are the quickest way to real-world utility and a monopoly. The more lofty solutions, such as decentralized data storage, are not making much progress when it comes to market share. Memecoins, redundant DeFi protocols and incomplete metaverses are already suffering under the strain of zero sum competition between one another. There is no crypto community. The incestuous strategic partnerships of crypto projects with each other have resulted in limited innovation. It‚Äôs time for Web 3.0 founders to make a change. Billion-dollar partnerships are made via access to C-Suites of the world‚Äôs biggest companies ‚Äì not in the world of hashtags or virtual land. The Web 3.0 companies that don‚Äôt adapt to the fact that Web 3.0 has fallen far behind the AI industry in terms of innovation won‚Äôt be around for long.

US President Donald Trump has once again intensified public pressure on Fed Chair Jerome Powell to aggressively cut interest rates. Last week, he visited the central bank‚Äôs HQ and even toured the Fed‚Äôs $2.5‚ÄØbillion renovation site, although Trump claimed that the price had jumped to over $3 billion due to increased restoration costs. The Fed subsequently justified the project, pointing to the aging, almost century-old infrastructure, the necessity of removing hazardous materials, and escalating construction expenses. Also, Powell disputed Trump‚Äôs higher figure due to the US President including a previously completed renovation from five years ago.

2025-07-29T03:10:10,"Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation: Unveiling the Shocking 24-Hour Losses","BitcoinWorld Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation: Unveiling the Shocking 24-Hour Losses The cryptocurrency market, a realm of electrifying volatility and immense potential, often delivers sharp, impactful reminders of its inherent risks. In the last 24 hours, a significant event unfolded in the world of crypto derivatives, leaving a trail of substantial liquidations across major digital assets. If you‚Äôre involved in crypto trading, or even just keenly observing the market, understanding these powerful movements, especially the mechanics and implications of crypto perpetual futures liquidation , is absolutely crucial for navigating the market‚Äôs often unpredictable currents. What Exactly is Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation, and Why Does it Matter? Before diving into the numbers, let‚Äôs demystify what we‚Äôre talking about. A perpetual futures contract is a type of derivative that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without an expiration date. Unlike traditional futures, perpetuals mimic the spot market price through a mechanism called ‚Äòfunding rates‚Äô. They are incredibly popular because they offer high leverage, meaning you can control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital (your ‚Äòmargin‚Äô). This brings us to liquidation . In simple terms, liquidation occurs when a trader‚Äôs leveraged position is automatically closed by the exchange due to insufficient margin to cover potential losses. When the market moves against a trader‚Äôs leveraged position, and their equity (initial margin plus/minus profit/loss) falls below a certain maintenance margin level, the exchange steps in to prevent the account balance from going negative. This automatic closure is the liquidation, and it means the trader loses their entire margin for that position. Why does it matter so much? For individual traders, it represents significant, often total, loss of capital on that specific trade. For the broader market, large-scale liquidations can create a domino effect, pushing prices down further as exchanges sell off assets, leading to more liquidations ‚Äì a phenomenon known as a ‚Äòliquidation cascade‚Äô. This is why monitoring crypto perpetual futures liquidation data provides critical insights into market sentiment and potential price movements. The Staggering 24-Hour Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation Breakdown The recent 24-hour period has been particularly telling, showcasing substantial losses for traders holding leveraged positions. Here‚Äôs a detailed look at the numbers: Cryptocurrency Total Liquidation Value Percentage of Long Liquidations Ethereum (ETH) $140 million 78.40% Bitcoin (BTC) $38.31 million 84.98% Solana (SOL) $27.88 million 87.72% These figures paint a vivid picture of market activity. Ethereum (ETH) saw the largest liquidation volume, an astonishing $140 million. This highlights ETH‚Äôs significant role in the DeFi ecosystem and its popularity among leveraged traders. Bitcoin (BTC), the market‚Äôs behemoth, experienced over $38 million in liquidations, while Solana (SOL), a rapidly growing ecosystem, contributed nearly $28 million to the total. What‚Äôs particularly striking across all three assets is the overwhelming percentage of ‚ÄòLong‚Äô liquidations. Why Were So Many Long Positions Liquidated? Unpacking Market Dynamics The high percentage of long liquidations (positions betting on price increases) clearly indicates that the market experienced a significant downward price movement. Here‚Äôs why this typically happens: Market Correction or Downturn: A sudden or sustained dip in asset prices directly impacts long positions. As prices fall, the value of a long position decreases, pushing the trader‚Äôs margin balance closer to the liquidation threshold. Over-Leveraging: Many traders, fueled by optimism or the fear of missing out (FOMO), often take on excessive leverage. While leverage amplifies potential gains, it also drastically magnifies losses, making positions far more susceptible to even minor price fluctuations. Lack of Stop-Loss Orders: Without proper risk management tools like stop-loss orders, traders allow their losses to accumulate, eventually leading to the exchange forcibly closing their positions. Cascading Effects: When a large number of long positions are liquidated, it creates selling pressure on the market. This downward pressure can trigger further liquidations, creating a negative feedback loop that accelerates price declines. Unexpected News or Macro Events: Sometimes, unexpected macroeconomic data, regulatory news, or significant market events can trigger sharp price movements, catching leveraged traders off guard. The dominance of long liquidations in this 24-hour period serves as a powerful reminder of the risks associated with bullish bets in a volatile environment, especially when coupled with high leverage. Navigating the Volatile Seas: Strategies to Mitigate Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation Risk Understanding crypto perpetual futures liquidation is one thing; avoiding it is another. While no strategy can guarantee immunity from market volatility, adopting disciplined trading practices can significantly mitigate your risk exposure: Prudent Leverage Management: This is perhaps the most critical advice. Avoid using maximum leverage, especially if you are new to futures trading. Start with low leverage (e.g., 2x-5x) to give your positions more breathing room against price swings. Implementing Stop-Loss Orders: Always set a stop-loss order when entering a leveraged trade. This automatically closes your position if the price reaches a predetermined level, limiting your potential losses and preventing liquidation. Effective Position Sizing: Never allocate a disproportionately large percentage of your total trading capital to a single leveraged trade. Diversify your risk across multiple smaller positions or different asset classes. Continuous Market Analysis: Stay informed about market trends, news, and sentiment. Understanding potential support and resistance levels, as well as upcoming economic or crypto-specific events, can help you make more informed trading decisions. Understanding Margin Requirements: Familiarize yourself with the initial margin and maintenance margin requirements of your chosen exchange. Always keep sufficient collateral in your account to avoid unexpected liquidations. Risk-Reward Ratio: Before entering a trade, calculate your potential risk (maximum loss) versus your potential reward (target profit). Only take trades where the reward significantly outweighs the risk. Remember, the goal isn‚Äôt just to make profits, but to preserve capital. Responsible risk management is your best defense against the sudden and often brutal impact of crypto perpetual futures liquidation . Conclusion: Navigating the High-Stakes World of Perpetual Futures The recent 24-hour breakdown of crypto perpetual futures liquidation serves as a stark reminder of the inherent volatility and amplified risks present in leveraged cryptocurrency trading. While perpetual futures offer incredible opportunities for magnified gains, they demand a profound understanding of market dynamics, rigorous risk management, and disciplined execution. The significant long liquidations across ETH, BTC, and SOL underscore the dangers of over-leveraging and the importance of preparing for market downturns. For any trader looking to engage with these powerful instruments, continuous education, a conservative approach to leverage, and the strategic use of risk mitigation tools are not just recommendations‚Äîthey are essential for survival and long-term success in this exhilarating yet challenging market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a perpetual futures contract in crypto? A perpetual futures contract is a type of derivative in cryptocurrency trading that allows traders to speculate on the price of an asset without an expiry date. Unlike traditional futures, it uses a ‚Äòfunding rate‚Äô mechanism to keep its price anchored to the underlying spot market price, offering continuous trading opportunities with leverage. 2. How does crypto liquidation work? Crypto liquidation occurs when a trader‚Äôs leveraged position is automatically closed by an exchange because their margin balance falls below the required maintenance margin. This happens when the market moves unfavorably against their position, and they no longer have enough collateral to cover potential losses, resulting in the loss of their initial margin for that trade. 3. Why are long positions liquidated more often during market downturns? Long positions are bets that an asset‚Äôs price will increase. During a market downturn, prices fall, directly impacting these positions. As the price drops, the value of a long position decreases, pushing it closer to the liquidation price. Conversely, short positions (bets on price decreases) would be profitable in a downturn. 4. What is ‚Äòleverage‚Äô in crypto futures trading? Leverage in crypto futures trading allows you to open positions larger than your actual capital. For example, with 10x leverage, a $100 margin can control a $1,000 position. While it can magnify profits, it also significantly amplifies losses, making your position more vulnerable to liquidation with smaller price movements. 5. How can I avoid liquidation in crypto futures trading? To avoid liquidation, it‚Äôs crucial to manage risk effectively. Key strategies include using lower leverage, setting strict stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, employing proper position sizing (not risking too much capital on one trade), and continuously monitoring market conditions to make informed decisions. 6. Is perpetual futures trading suitable for beginners? Due to its complexity, high leverage, and significant risk of liquidation, perpetual futures trading is generally not recommended for beginners. It requires a strong understanding of market dynamics, risk management, and technical analysis. It‚Äôs advisable for new traders to start with spot trading and gradually learn about derivatives before engaging in perpetual futures.

The comments mark a notable shift from his 2022 recommendation of just 1‚Äì2% in BTC, reflecting growing concern over what Dalio calls a ‚Äúdebt doom loop.‚Äù He pointed to a projected $12 trillion in new Treasury issuance over the next year, required to service the U.S.'s $36.7 trillion national debt. A U.S. Treasury report on Monday confirmed the trend , with the government expecting to borrow $1 trillion in Q3, $453 billion more than previously forecast, followed by $590 billion in Q4. Dalio, who still favors gold over bitcoin, described both as ‚Äúeffective diversifiers‚Äù in a scenario where fiat currencies lose value relative to hard assets. Still, he maintains skepticism about the asset's role as a reserve currency, citing concerns about surveillance and the transparency of the blockchain. ‚ÄúGovernments can see who is doing what transactions on it,‚Äù he said, adding that any code-level vulnerabilities could undermine Bbtcoin‚Äôs credibility as an alternative money. While Dalio owns ‚Äúsome Bitcoin,‚Äù he framed his updated 15% recommendation as flexible: The specific ratio of BTC to gold is ‚Äúup to you,‚Äù he said.

While dips below $112K may present buying opportunities, a sustained decline would require reassessment of risk. The level‚Äôs psychological significance aligns with historical resistance flips that often precede long-term rallies. Altcoin-Focused Funds Suffer as BTC Dominates While Bitcoin thrives, altcoin-heavy liquid crypto funds have seen dramatic losses. Asymmetric Capital‚Äôs Liquid Alpha Fund collapsed by 78% despite Bitcoin‚Äôs gains, due to overexposure to speculative altcoins and excessive leverage. Institutional capital is now favoring utility-driven, revenue-generating projects over memecoins. Experts like Rajiv Patel-O‚ÄôConnor emphasize that future crypto investments must meet stricter criteria; liquidity, transparency, and token utility. Related Reading: Want Bitcoin Or Ether Exposure?
