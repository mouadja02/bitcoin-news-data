2025-07-29T05:59:12,"“CoinDCX Not for Sale”, Says CEO Sumit Gupta Amid Coinbase Acquisition Rumours","The post “CoinDCX Not for Sale”, Says CEO Sumit Gupta Amid Coinbase Acquisition Rumours appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As global crypto adoption expands , all eyes are turning to Asia—and especially India—as the next big growth frontier. With over 93 million users, India now ranks as the largest crypto-owning country in the world. That makes it no surprise that Coinbase, the largest publicly listed crypto exchange in the U.S., is reportedly making a move in this market. The Claim Recent media reports suggest that Coinbase is in talks to acquire CoinDCX, one of India’s top cryptocurrency exchanges, at a valuation of under $1 billion. The timing of these alleged negotiations has raised eyebrows, as it follows closely after a $44 million hack on CoinDCX , which reportedly affected the exchange’s valuation and market reputation. CoinDCX had previously reached a $2.2 billion valuation in 2022 after a $135 million Series D funding round. But after suffering unauthorized access to its hot wallet in July 2025, its estimated worth has fallen significantly, reportedly creating a window for acquisition talks to begin. What CoinDCX Said? Despite the flurry of speculation, CoinDCX CEO Sumit Gupta has publicly denied the rumors. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), he stated clearly “CoinDCX is not up for sale!” Sumit Gupta on X His statement comes amid rising media coverage of the potential deal, but his tone leaves little room for doubt that CoinDCX is staying independent for now. Coinbase’s Position Coinbase has not confirmed or denied the acquisition claim. In its standard approach to speculation, the company said it does not comment on market rumors. However, Coinbase’s recent progress in India, particularly gaining registration with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), signals a serious intent to expand in the region. Its 2022 launch in India was halted amid regulatory uncertainties, but it now seems to be rebuilding that plan through more compliant and strategic steps. Coinpedia’s Fact Check Verdict As of now, there is no official confirmation from either Coinbase or CoinDCX that an acquisition is underway. While local reports and market speculation suggest interest, the only direct public statement, by CoinDCX’s CEO, flatly denies any deal is in progress. Given this clear denial and the lack of formal confirmation from Coinbase, Coinpedia finds the claim to be untrue at this time. What’s Next? India remains a key strategic market for Coinbase and other global crypto firms. With a massive user base and growing regulatory clarity , we’ll likely see more moves in the region from partnerships to infrastructure expansion. Whether that includes a future acquisition, and whether CoinDCX could still be part of those plans, remains to be seen.But for now, the Coinbase–CoinDCX deal is just a rumor. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-29T05:51:08,"How Much More Bitcoin (BTC) Can Strategy Buy? Here Are the Latest Figures Based on Current Data","Bitcoin treasury firm Strategy, led by Michael Saylor, made a remarkable move in the crypto markets with its share sale on July 24. The company priced 28 million shares of its new variable-rate preferred stock, called “Stretch” (STRC), at $90 per share, generating total gross proceeds of $2.52 billion. This sale was the largest initial public offering (IPO) in 2025, exceeding the initial target of $500 million. According to investment bank TD Cowen, the $2.47 billion in net proceeds from this capital raise will be largely used for new BTC purchases. Assuming an average price of $120,000 per Bitcoin, Strategy plans to add more than 20,500 BTC to its treasury. “Strategy acts as a conduit for institutional capital flows into Bitcoin by offering BTC-backed securities that appeal to different investor classes,” TD Cowen analysts Lance Vitanza and Jonnathan Navarrete wrote in a note to investors. The analysts noted that the company's cost of capital advantage is unrivaled in the industry and that this business model has attracted many new companies. The same note also stated that the company could purchase more than 17,000 more bitcoins over the next 10 years without diluting common stock. This projection was made assuming some share issuances would be required to fund cash dividends associated with floating-rate STRC shares. Related News: Experienced Analyst Explains the Reason Behind BNB's Explosive Rally STRC shares will pay annual cumulative dividends at a variable rate based on a par value of $100 per share. STRC is included in the portfolio along with other types of Strategy preferred stock. Strike (STRK) is convertible with an 8% fixed dividend, while Strife (STRF) is non-convertible with a 10% fixed cumulative dividend. Stride (STRD) pays a fixed, periodic dividend of 10% and is also non-convertible. These moves are considered part of the steps taken within the scope of the company’s “42/42” strategy, in which it aims to acquire BTC by raising a total capital of $84 billion by 2027. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-29T05:30:00,"Ray Dalio Recommends Putting 15% in Bitcoin or Gold","On the Master Investor podcast, Dalio described the allocation as offering the “best return-to-risk ratio” amid what he called a looming economic crisis. While Dalio admitted to holding a small amount of Bitcoin, he still favors gold, though he acknowledged that both assets have outperformed in recent months. Meanwhile, Michael Saylor’s firm, Strategy, paused Bitcoin purchases for the second time in July, holding at 607,770 BTC. Despite the pause, the company is still very much committed to its BTC strategy and recently upsized a fundraising round to $2.52 billion to support future buys. Ray Dalio Backs 15% Bitcoin, Gold Allocation American billionaire and Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio once again weighed in on the ongoing economic crisis in the United States, and urged investors to consider allocating a large portion of their portfolios—around 15%—to either Bitcoin or gold. On the Master Investor podcast , Dalio pointed out that such an allocation will offer the “best return-to-risk ratio” in the current environment, shaped by America’s soaring national debt and the ongoing devaluation of its currency. While Dalio admitted he personally holds “some Bitcoin, but not much,” he did suggest a clear preference for gold, though he left the exact split between the two assets up to individual investors. His latest suggestion is a stark shift from his earlier recommendation in January of 2022, when he advised just a 1% to 2% Bitcoin allocation. Dalio’s warning was made amid fresh concerns about the fiscal health of the US government, which is grappling with a record $36.7 trillion in national debt . He said that the Treasury is expected to issue another $12 trillion in securities over the coming year just to service this debt. Supporting his concerns, a recent US Treasury report projected $1 trillion in new borrowing for the third quarter of 2025—$453 billion more than previously estimated—due to weaker cash flows and declining reserves. Another $590 billion in borrowing is anticipated for Q4, which means that there is an intensifying reliance on debt to fund federal expenditures. Dalio also warned that other Western economies, like the United Kingdom, are facing a similar “debt doom loop,” and he argued that currencies in these regions are likely to continue underperforming against hard assets like Bitcoin and gold. Despite recognizing Bitcoin’s value as an “effective diversifier,” Dalio is still somewhat skeptical about its viability as a reserve currency. He pointed out that Bitcoin’s lack of privacy and the transparency of its blockchain make it unlikely that central banks will adopt it for official monetary use, especially considering the risk of potential vulnerabilities in its code. Still, both Bitcoin and gold have shown strong performance despite growing economic uncertainty. Bitcoin is currently trading at around $118,344, which is approximately 4% below its July 14 all-time high of $123,230. Gold also posted multiple record highs in recent months. BTC price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarletCap ) Strategy Pauses Bitcoin Buys Again One of the companies that is notorious for allocating money towards buying Bitcoin surprisingly did not purchase any over the past week. Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which is the largest public holder of Bitcoin, reported no new BTC purchases last week, despite impressive market activity that saw Bitcoin’s price climb from around $118,000 to over $119,000. According to a US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing that was released Monday, the firm’s Bitcoin holdings stayed at 607,770 BTC. This was the second time in July that Strategy did not buy any Bitcoin, following a similar pause in the first week of the month. Strategy Bitcoin purchase update (Source: SEC ) The slowdown reflects an overall deceleration in Strategy’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy. In July, the company reported only two purchases: 4,225 BTC on July 14 and 6,220 BTC on July 21, totaling 10,445 BTC. This is a 39% decline compared to the 17,075 BTC that was acquired in June. The firm’s buying pace was even more aggressive earlier in the year, with 26,695 BTC purchased in May and 25,370 BTC in April. Apart from July, the only other week Strategy skipped a Bitcoin purchase in recent months was the first week of April. The pause in buying happened alongside Strategy’s decision to expand its fundraising efforts. On Friday, the company upsized its Series A perpetual stretch preferred stock (STRC) offering from $500 million to $2.521 billion. The stock was priced at $90, with the transaction expected to settle on Tuesday, pending customary closing conditions. This new equity raise follows a similar pattern to earlier Strategy offerings, like the STRK program, and is intended to provide more capital for future Bitcoin acquisitions. Despite the buying pause, Strategy is still very committed to its aggressive Bitcoin strategy. Co-founder Michael Saylor recently posted on X referring to the STRC as one of four key instruments in what he described as the company’s “Bitcoin defense department.”",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/10231/ray-dalio-recommends-putting-15-in-bitcoin-or-gold,"BTC|FIAT|BUSINESS|REGULATION|BTG","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-07-29T05:25:10,"Ethereum Valuation: Unlocking the Astonishing $60,000 Potential","BitcoinWorld Ethereum Valuation: Unlocking the Astonishing $60,000 Potential In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, where innovation meets speculation, a recent announcement from BitMine Immersion Technologies has sent ripples across the market, sparking intense debate about the true Ethereum valuation . This New York Stock Exchange-listed Bitcoin mining company made a bold claim on X, suggesting that Ethereum (ETH) could hypothetically command a ‘replacement’ value of an astonishing $60,000. This figure dwarfs its current market price of approximately $3,800. What exactly does this mean for the future of Ethereum, and why are Wall Street firms eyeing such a dramatic potential? What is BitMine’s Astonishing Ethereum Valuation Claim? BitMine Immersion Technologies, primarily known for its Bitcoin mining operations, recently shared insights that have captivated the crypto community. The company revealed it commissioned several reputable research firms to estimate the hypothetical ‘replacement’ value of Ethereum within the context of Wall Street’s analytical frameworks. The consensus from these firms pointed towards an illustrative value of $60,000 per ETH. This isn’t just a casual prediction; it’s from a publicly traded entity engaging with traditional financial research. The sheer magnitude of the proposed value – over 15 times its current trading price – naturally raises questions and excitement. BitMine also highlighted a key observation: ETH treasury firms tend to consistently increase the amount of ETH held per share over time. This trend, they suggest, could enable these firms to potentially outperform the asset itself, implying a strong belief in Ethereum’s long-term growth and stability as a digital asset. Understanding the ‘Replacement Value’ Concept in Ethereum Valuation The term ‘replacement value’ is typically used in traditional finance to estimate the cost of replacing an existing asset or infrastructure with a new one of similar utility. Applying this concept to a decentralized digital asset like Ethereum, however, introduces unique complexities and interpretations. For Wall Street, estimating the Ethereum valuation based on replacement cost could involve several facets: Cost of Network Development: What would it cost to build a blockchain network from scratch offering Ethereum’s security, decentralization, and smart contract capabilities? This includes R&D, talent, and infrastructure. Utility as a Global Settlement Layer: Ethereum functions as a foundational layer for countless decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and DeFi protocols. Its replacement value might reflect the immense economic activity and innovation built upon its network. Competitive Advantage & Network Effects: Ethereum boasts the largest developer community and most robust ecosystem. Replacing this network effect and established trust would be incredibly expensive. Energy Efficiency Post-Merge: After its transition to Proof-of-Stake (the Merge), Ethereum significantly reduced its energy consumption. Its ‘replacement’ might also factor in the cost of developing a similarly sustainable, high-performance blockchain. Unlike a physical asset, Ethereum’s value isn’t just in its code but in its utility, adoption, and the collective trust placed in its decentralized infrastructure. Wall Street firms, when assessing such a value, are likely looking at it through the lens of a technology giant or a digital commodity with unparalleled utility. Why is BitMine Making This Bold Ethereum Valuation Prediction? It might seem unusual for a Bitcoin mining company to extensively research and publicize a hypothetical Ethereum valuation . However, BitMine’s move could be interpreted in several strategic ways: Diversified Market Insight: While primarily a Bitcoin miner, BitMine operates within the broader crypto ecosystem. Valuing major assets like Ethereum offers comprehensive market insight and potential future diversification. Highlighting Crypto’s Undervalued Potential: By presenting such a high hypothetical value for Ethereum, BitMine might be signaling to traditional finance that the entire crypto market, including Bitcoin, is significantly undervalued by conventional metrics. Strategic Positioning: As the crypto landscape evolves, companies like BitMine might be exploring new revenue streams beyond pure Bitcoin mining, such as Ethereum staking or supporting Ethereum-based applications. A strong belief in ETH’s value would align with such strategic shifts. Generating Discussion & Interest: A bold claim like $60,000 ETH undoubtedly generates significant media attention and discussion, drawing more eyes to the company and the broader crypto space. This move underscores a growing trend of traditional finance adapting valuation frameworks for digital assets. The Role of ETH Treasury Firms in Boosting Ethereum Valuation BitMine’s announcement also emphasized the behavior of ‘ETH treasury firms’ – entities that hold significant amounts of Ethereum as part of their corporate treasury or investment portfolios. The observation that these firms tend to increase their ETH holdings per share over time is a critical insight for understanding long-term Ethereum valuation dynamics. Similar to a company buying back shares, ETH treasury firms accumulating more Ethereum signals strategic, long-term conviction in the asset’s utility and appreciation. This accumulation strategy can influence the market in several ways: Reduced Supply on Exchanges: As more ETH is moved into long-term treasury holdings or staking protocols, the circulating supply available for trading decreases, potentially leading to upward price pressure given constant or increasing demand. Institutional Validation: The consistent accumulation by treasury firms provides a strong signal of institutional confidence, attracting more traditional investors who look for such indicators. Foundation for Future Growth: These holdings can serve as a war chest for future development, investment in the Ethereum ecosystem, or as a liquid asset for corporate needs, further cementing Ethereum’s role in the digital economy. This behavior suggests crypto market maturation, with sophisticated players adopting strategies akin to traditional corporate treasury management. What are the Challenges and Opportunities for This Ethereum Valuation? While a $60,000 Ethereum valuation presents an exciting prospect, it’s essential to consider the landscape of challenges and opportunities that could influence its journey to such a lofty target. Challenges: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile. Macroeconomic shifts, regulatory crackdowns, or security breaches could significantly impact prices. Regulatory Uncertainty: Evolving global regulations pose uncertainty; unfavorable rules could stifle adoption. Scalability & Competition: Ethereum, while upgrading (e.g., Layer 2), faces competition from other Layer 1 blockchains offering faster transactions or lower fees. Network Congestion & Gas Fees: Despite improvements, periods of high network activity can still lead to elevated transaction fees, which might deter some users. Opportunities: Institutional Adoption: Potential spot Ethereum ETFs could unlock significant institutional capital, similar to Bitcoin ETFs. DeFi, NFT, and Web3 Growth: Ethereum remains the backbone of DeFi, NFTs, and Web3. Continued innovation and adoption will drive ETH demand. EIP-1559 & Deflationary Mechanics: EIP-1559’s fee-burning mechanism makes ETH potentially deflationary, increasing scarcity and value. Staking Yields: Post-Merge, ETH staking yields attract long-term holders, reducing circulating supply. The path to $60,000 is not without hurdles, but the underlying technological advancements and growing utility of Ethereum provide a compelling narrative for its long-term potential. Actionable Insights for Investors For investors considering the implications of BitMine’s bold estimate, here are some actionable insights: Perspective is Key: The $60,000 figure is a hypothetical ‘replacement value’ from research firms, reflecting long-term potential, not short-term market dynamics. Due Diligence: Always conduct thorough research: understand Ethereum’s technology, roadmap, competition, and market trends. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Valuation estimates point to long-term potential; short-term prices are influenced by news, sentiment, and macro factors. Risk Management: Allocate wisely. Cryptocurrencies are high-risk; never invest more than you can afford to lose. Stay Informed: Follow reputable news sources, engage with the Ethereum community, and keep abreast of regulatory developments and technological upgrades. A Compelling Future for Ethereum? BitMine Immersion Technologies’ hypothetical $60,000 Ethereum valuation is more than a headline; it’s a profound statement on how traditional finance may perceive decentralized digital assets. While speculative, this estimate, derived from Wall Street research firms, underscores the immense utility, network effects, and future potential that Ethereum holds as the backbone of the decentralized internet. The consistent accumulation by ETH treasury firms further solidifies the long-term bullish sentiment. As the crypto market matures and institutional adoption continues to grow, the frameworks for valuing assets like Ethereum will become increasingly sophisticated. Whether ETH reaches this valuation remains to be seen, but the discussion highlights a future where digital assets are recognized for their fundamental role, not just speculation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does ‘replacement value’ mean for a cryptocurrency like Ethereum? A1: For Ethereum, ‘replacement value’ refers to the hypothetical cost of building a new blockchain network from scratch that offers the same level of decentralization, security, developer ecosystem, and smart contract capabilities as the existing Ethereum network. It considers its utility and network effects as a foundational digital infrastructure. Q2: Who is BitMine Immersion Technologies? A2: BitMine Immersion Technologies is a Bitcoin (BTC) mining company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. While primarily focused on Bitcoin, their recent announcement indicates a broader interest in the valuation and potential of other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. Q3: Is a $60,000 Ethereum valuation realistic? A3: The $60,000 figure is presented as a ‘hypothetical’ and ‘illustrative’ replacement value estimated by research firms for Wall Street context, not a guaranteed price target. While ambitious, it reflects a long-term potential based on Ethereum’s utility and ecosystem growth. It suggests fundamental undervaluation. Q4: How do ETH treasury firms influence Ethereum’s price? A4: ETH treasury firms, by consistently increasing their holdings of Ethereum per share, signal strong long-term conviction. This accumulation reduces the circulating supply on exchanges, potentially driving up prices due to scarcity, and provides institutional validation, attracting more investors to the asset. Q5: What are the key factors that could drive Ethereum’s future value? A5: Key factors include continued growth in DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 applications built on Ethereum, potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs leading to institutional capital inflow, the deflationary impact of EIP-1559, and the attractiveness of staking yields post-Merge. Regulatory clarity and ongoing scalability improvements are also crucial. Q6: Should I invest in ETH based on this valuation?

Instead of rising, Pi Coin has been struggling. In the past month alone, its price has dropped by over 17 percent and is currently trading near $0.43. Since June, it has been moving between $0.39 and $0.67, unable to break out of this range. Massive Token Unlock Adds Pressure To make matters more difficult, an event hit the Pi ecosystem today. Around 10.8 million PI tokens were unlocked and released into the market. This is the biggest release this month. Large token unlocks like this usually increase the supply in circulation, which can push prices down even further. Still One of the Most Active Crypto Projects But while the token price might look weak, the Pi Network itself is far from failing. Crypto analyst Kim Wong recently shared his thoughts online and made a strong case for why Pi Network is actually a success story. Do I think Pi Network is successful? Heck,yes! Check out the facts: 1. Over 65 million users in 200 countries around the world. 2. 4.34 million X followers, ranked 3rd among top 10 cryptos right afrer Binance's 14.7 million and Bitcoin's 7.8 million. 3. KYC verified over 18… pic.twitter.com/bolRAo6oh3 — Kim H Wong (@Time_and_Trade) July 28, 2025 According to him, Pi Network has already attracted more than 65 million users from over 200 countries. That’s a huge number for any project, especially one that’s still finding its place in the market. On social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Pi Network has gained over 4.3 million followers. That makes it the third most followed crypto project in the world, right behind only Binance and Bitcoin. Strong KYC and Wallet Activity More than 18 million users have completed KYC (Know Your Customer) verification, and over 13 million of them have already moved their Pi tokens to wallets. These are massive numbers, especially for a project that hasn’t been fully listed on major exchanges yet. Despite its low price, Pi Coin currently ranks number 34 in terms of global market capitalization. Another sign of Pi’s strength is its technical infrastructure. More than 400,000 nodes are running across Pi’s Testnet1, Testnet2, and Mainnet. New Projects and Tools Rolling Out There are real products coming out of this network. Pi recently launched a $100 million Pi Ventures Fund to support startups that use Pi Coin. Other projects include Pi App Studio, which helps people build apps with AI tools, the FruityPi game, and Pi Domains, which are already gaining attention in the community. Real-World Utility on the Rise Even more impressive is the growing real-world use of Pi Coin. Over 27,000 merchants across Asia, Africa, and Latin America now accept Pi for everyday purchases. That’s real adoption, not just speculation. And to make Pi even easier to use, a “Buy Pi” tab has been added to the Pi wallet, allowing people to purchase Pi using regular fiat money.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/is-pi-network-a-scam-thatll-never-hit-1-again-65m-users-4-3m-followers-400k-nodes-say-otherwise/,"TRADING|MARKET|BNB|BTC|EXCHANGE","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-07-29T05:14:05,"Bitcoin ETFs Log Third Day of Gains as Ethereum Inflows Hit 17-Day Streak","Investor appetite for crypto exchange-traded funds showed no signs of cooling on July 28, with spot Bitcoin ETFs pulling in $157m in net inflows, marking the third straight day of gains. BlackRock’s IBIT led the charge with $147.36m, significantly outpacing its peers and reinforcing its lead among spot Bitcoin products. Cumulative inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs have now reached $54.98b, with assets under management climbing to $153.19b, according to data from SoSoValue . The funds saw $3.34b in trading volume that day, despite a wider market pullback that left total crypto market cap down over 5%. BlackRock’s ETHA Leads as Ether ETFs Surge in Popularity Ethereum ETFs, meanwhile, continued their remarkable streak, drawing $65.14m in net inflows on July 28, extending their run to 17 consecutive days. BlackRock’s ETHA stood out with a $131.95m inflow, lifting its net assets to $11.22b and underscoring growing institutional confidence in Ethereum-based products. On July 28, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a total net inflow of $157 million, marking the third consecutive day of net inflows. The largest inflow came from BlackRock’s ETF, IBIT, which recorded a net inflow of $147 million. Spot Ethereum ETFs registered a total net inflow of $65.14… pic.twitter.com/wBGfwLd251 — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) July 29, 2025 That confidence reflects more than short-term trading dynamics. Jamie Elkaleh, chief marketing officer at Bitget Wallet, pointed to broader structural changes. “Ethereum’s recent breakout—surging over 60% and outperforming Bitcoin—marks more than just short-term momentum,” he said. “The ETH/BTC ratio has not only broken above its 200-day average for the first time in over a year, but also formed a daily golden cross, a classic signal of sustained trend reversal.” Corporate Treasuries Pivot to Ethereum as Institutional Demand Grows Jeffrey Hu, head of investment research at HashKey Capital, echoed this sentiment. “The recent ETH rally has been driven by several converging factors that signal a fundamental shift in both narrative and institutional adoption,” he said. “Most importantly, geopolitical and macroeconomic FUD no longer clouds the narrative. Increasing regulatory clarity in the US is fueling a capital rotation into the altcoin market.” Hu also pointed to what may be the clearest sign of Ethereum’s rising stature, a growing wave of corporate accumulation. “Wednesday’s record $726.6m inflow day for spot ETH ETFs is a strong vote of confidence from traditional finance,” he said. “More significantly, we’ve seen a corporate treasury pivot. SharpLink Gaming overtook the Ethereum Foundation to become the largest corporate holder of ether, with 280,706 ETH worth approximately $840m.” According to Hu, this isn’t a one-off event. Top corporate treasuries have purchased at least $1.6b worth of ETH in the past month alone. “This is a market shift from the previous focus on only Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset,” he said. What’s particularly bullish, he added, is that these companies are becoming active participants, running nodes and leveraging Ethereum’s staking yield, which introduces a structural demand dynamic not previously seen. Bitcoin ETFs Stay Strong, Yet Ethereum Pulls Ahead in Inflows and Activity ETH ETFs now manage $21.5b in assets, accounting for 4.7% of Ethereum’s market cap. Daily trading volumes across Ethereum ETFs totaled $1.91b, with additional support from VanEck’s EFUT and Grayscale’s ETHE. Bitcoin ETFs remain strong as well, with IBIT holding $87.19b in assets, equivalent to 3.71 percent of Bitcoin’s market cap. Fidelity’s FBTC added $30.8m on the day, while Ark Invest’s ARKB saw outflows of $17.45m. While Bitcoin remains technically robust above $119,000, the inflow momentum has clearly tilted toward Ethereum. With growing clarity, rising staking rewards, and a surge in institutional participation, Ethereum is increasingly being positioned not just as an alternative, but as a foundational layer of the next crypto cycle.

He argued that the initiative will help shield investors from America’s debt crisis, which has risen above $37.7 trillion. The hedge fund manager also said the 15% portfolio allocation into Bitcoin and gold will help investors optimize the best return-to-risk-ratio in the wake of dollar devaluation.

He also maintained that the 15% allocation was his suggestion, and it was up to the investor to decide what best suited their portfolio. The hedge fund manager’s 15% proposition is a bit higher than the 1% to 2% Bitcoin allocation he recommended in January 2022. At the time, he argued that gold and BTC were fit as an inflation hedge. “Gold is a much preferable diversifier to Bitcoin, as it tends to increase in price when risk aversion is high. It can be a useful insurance policy for a portfolio, but importantly held alongside shares and bonds to achieve a balance of risk and reward.” -Laith Khalaf, Head of Investment Analysis at AJ Bell. The American billionaire acknowledged that the current U.S debt problem and currency devaluation call for investors to consider other ways to diversify their portfolio. Dalio believes allocating 15% into store-of-value assets like gold and Bitcoin could help investors in such murky times. At the time of publication, U.S. Treasury data show that U.S. debt has surpassed $36.7 trillion. Dalio also believes the U.S. government will likely need to issue another $12 trillion worth of bonds over the next year to service its mounting debt. On Monday, the U.S. Treasury released a report that revealed the government could add another $1 trillion in debt in the third quarter. The projection surpassed the previous estimates of $453 billion, which were largely driven by weaker cash flows and lower reserves. The Treasury also revealed that the government could add another $590 billion in debt in Q4. The report noted that the U.S. government will continue to borrow due to its reliance on debt to fund budget expenses amid rising doubts about its future fiscal path. Dalio said that the U.S. is spending 40% more than it takes in, and that it can’t cut its spending. He also noted that the government has accumulated a debt that’s six times the amount of money it takes in, adding that its $1 trillion in interest payments is also half its budget deficit. The hedge fund manager argued that the Federal Reserve will need to print more money to service its debt. He believes that the situation for more cash could spook the markets and could involve another round of quantitative easing.

The country’s debt as a percentage of GDP rose to 101%, as its long-term borrowing costs also spiked higher. The hedge fund manager argued that the debt situation has given Chancellor Rachel Reeves little room to borrow more to fund spending. He also believes the debt crisis is affecting capital flows and has also made Reeves focus more on raising taxes instead. Dalio said the UK faces financial deterioration, which has caused investors to migrate worldwide. He urged the government to lower its deficit to about 3% of GDP from its current 5.1% of GDP by spending cuts and taxation.
