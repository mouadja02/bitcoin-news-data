2025-07-29T01:00:29,"Mega Bullish Bitcoin Price Prediction ‚Äì What to Expect in the Next 2 Years","Bitcoin‚Äôs future has sparked fresh debate among market strategists, especially after a new forecast challenged long-held assumptions about the timing of its next peak. According to Bitcoin analyst Mark Moss, the asset‚Äôs historic four-year cycle may no longer follow its familiar script. Instead of topping out in 2025 as widely expected, Moss believes the real price surge could extend into 2027‚Äîwith BTC potentially reaching $395,000 . This bold outlook is rooted in the Pi Cycle Top indicator, a tool that‚Äôs gained a loyal following for accurately signaling past Bitcoin peaks. It called the tops in 2013, 2017, and 2021. However, it‚Äôs now flashing a delayed top for the first time‚Äîraising questions about whether Bitcoin is entering a longer, more sustained bull phase. While Bitcoin prepares for what could be its biggest cycle yet, early investors are also eyeing newer opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has emerged as a high-interest candidate in today‚Äôs crypto scene. Institutional Demand Hints at a Delayed Supercycle What‚Äôs also different this time is the behavior of institutional players. Public companies and large funds are buying Bitcoin aggressively, often using leverage, suggesting growing confidence in Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term upside. This accumulation has become a core bullish signal for many observers. That kind of early institutional activity has previously fueled major rallies. And it‚Äôs during these pre-peak periods that smart investors often position themselves‚Äînot just in Bitcoin but in promising new assets gaining early traction. This Altcoin Just Set a New Presale Record One such project catching attention is MAGACOIN FINANCE. Its most recent presale round sold out at record speed, a clear signal of surging demand . Backed by a growing community and a roadmap focused on long-term value , the project is now being tracked by strategists calling for a potential 47x upside . Investors looking for high-risk , high-reward plays are now treating MAGACOIN FINANCE like the early days of top cryptocurrencies like DOGE ‚Äì but with a more utility-driven foundation. XRP Holders Exit as BTC Accumulators Take Charge Moss also drew attention to a curious market contrast: While institutional investors load up on Bitcoin, some high-profile XRP holders‚Äîfounders included‚Äîare quietly reducing their exposure. This divergence has raised concerns about XRP‚Äôs long-term narrative, especially as Bitcoin continues to dominate attention and inflows. At the heart of the discussion is whether the crypto market is transitioning into a new phase‚Äîone that favors patient accumulation and long-term conviction over short-term gains. If so, Bitcoin‚Äôs journey to $395,000 may be slower, but possibly far more explosive than the previous cycles suggested. Conclusion Bitcoin‚Äôs extended cycle projection has reignited bullish sentiment, with new highs now expected closer to 2027. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs record-setting presale and projected 47x returns have made it one of the most closely watched altcoins this quarter‚Äîcementing its spot on the radar of forward-looking investors.

2025-07-29T00:59:03,"Asia Morning Briefing: Crypto Rally Stalls, ETH Flows May Decide What Comes Next","Good Morning, Asia. Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. The crypto market is flashing warning signs. Institutions are stepping back as they take profit, ETF inflows are collapsing, and bitcoin (BTC) looks rangebound as it struggles to challenge $120K. Market observers say that the focus now turns to Ether (ETH) and whether it can bring capital back into the fold. After BTC's brief touch of all-time highs , the market has entered a consolidation phase. Glassnode data shows institutional ETF inflows have dramatically cooled, plunging 80% this week to just $496 million, accompanied by a decline in ETF trading volume to $18.7 billion. Bitcoin's spot market sentiment is also weakening, with Relative Strength Index ‚Äì a measure of an asset if overbought or oversold status ‚Äì retreating sharply, underscoring that the asset is moving away from overbought levels. These signals indicate a clear institutional withdrawal, raising questions about potential further downside. QCP Capital notes similar tensions in derivatives. Funding rates for perpetual futures remain above 15%, suggesting aggressive long positioning, but recent flows show large players taking profit and hedging downside. A major ETH call fly was unwound, QCP said in its note, while sizeable BTC puts were bought for protection, not the kind of activity that supports a fresh leg up. Still, QCP remains constructive. ‚ÄúMomentum, narrative strength, and macro tailwinds are still on our side,‚Äù it wrote in a recent update. ‚ÄúHodlers and institutions will likely buy the dip, as we saw on Friday.‚Äù Enflux, however, isn‚Äôt sounding the alarm. The market maker views current conditions as a period of consolidation, not capitulation. Spot and perp markets are treading water, not bleeding out. ‚ÄúHow institutional ETH flows evolve, and whether capital re-engages with alts, would likely guide the next leg of market structure,‚Äù the firm said in a note to CoinDesk. ETH is caught between these perspectives. If institutions return, capital could rotate back into ETH and reignite the altcoin cycle. If not, this consolidation may harden into something worse. For now, the rally has paused and the path forward hinges on Ethereum. Glassnode sees fragility. Enflux sees neutrality. QCP sees hedged optimism. But the next breakout, or breakdown, will likely be sparked by how ETH flows materialize. Market Movements BTC: Bitcoin is trading at $118K, consolidating between channel support at $114K and resistance near the all-time high of $123K, after a liquidity sweep below $116K and renewed supply from a reactivated whale wallet stalled bullish momentum, according to CoinDesk's market insights bot. ETH: Ethereum is trading at $3,783, holding a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern targeting $4,300, but neutral funding rates near multi-year resistance suggest trader caution, even as institutional accumulation continues Gold: Gold fell to a near three-week low, with spot prices down 0.7% to $3,313.57, as a U.S.-EU trade deal boosted risk sentiment and reduced demand for safe-haven assets ahead of a busy week for earnings and the Fed. Nikkei 225: Asia markets opened lower, with Japan‚Äôs Nikkei 225 down 0.61% as traders are in wait-and-see mode to determine if more trade deals can be struck around the region.
