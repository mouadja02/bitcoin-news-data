2025-07-29T12:47:38,"BTCMiner Cloud Mining Platform Stands Out as the Most Stable Choice in the Volatile Second Half of 2025","A recent announcement from the U.S. government revealed plans to implement a new tariff policy across several major trading countries, effective August 1, 2025, with tax rate increases ranging from 15% to 20%. This policy is widely seen as adding further pressure to the global economy, particularly amid ongoing challenges like high inflation and consumer spending contraction. Economists are concerned that this new round of tariffs could disrupt global supply chains and negatively impact traditional investment markets, such as real estate, gold, and stocks. As a result, investors are increasingly turning to the cryptocurrency sector to explore alternative assets with greater resilience to market volatility. In July, the U.S. government officially approved a policy allowing pension funds to allocate investments to cryptocurrency assets. This decision not only legitimizes the crypto market for compliant funds but also signals the U.S.’s shift toward becoming a global hub for crypto finance. Analysts suggest this policy could unlock hundreds of billions of dollars in potential investment, providing long-term upward momentum for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. A spokesperson for BTCMiner, a leader in the cloud mining industry, said: Many investors still don’t know much about cloud mining? Traditional Mining : Requires purchasing mining equipment, securing electricity, setting up systems, and troubleshooting issues, which is costly and technically complex.

2025-07-29T12:46:20,"FDIG: The Underwhelming Underachiever","Summary FDIG offers low expenses and diversified crypto equity exposure but lacks the asymmetric upside seen in top-performing peers like BLOK or pure Bitcoin. The ETF's holdings are highly correlated with Bitcoin, benefiting from bull markets but also exposed to sharp drawdowns if sentiment reverses. FDIG's construction prioritizes lower volatility, which limits participation in strong rallies and results in inferior risk-adjusted returns versus competitors. I rate FDIG a hold. For higher growth potential, investors should consider BLOK or direct Bitcoin exposure, as FDIG's strategy is only optimal in a flat market. The Fidelity Crypto Industry and Digital Payments ETF ( FDIG ) is focused on companies in the cryptocurrency and blockchain technology industries. This fund recently caught my attention due to it having one of the lowest expense ratios in my constructed peer universe, but it ultimately failed to live up to my expectations for asymmetric upside. I rate this ETF a hold and will dissect why investors should avoid it in favor of some of its more attractive alternatives. Overview Despite being thematically linked to the crypto industry, FDIG tracks equities only. However, some of its largest holdings, such as Coinbase ( COIN ) and Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), exhibit a strong positive correlation to the movement of Bitcoin. FDIG holds a mix of both pure crypto plays in the form of miners and exchanges, as well as enablers in the form of payment and fintech businesses with strong Bitcoin exposure. These companies comprise the Fidelity Crypto Industry and Digital Payments Index , which is rules-based and passively managed. In order for equities to be selected into the index, companies must have a market cap of over $100 million and have a $2 million daily trading volume. Chinese stocks are not included in the index. Additionally, companies must have more than 50% of their revenues generated from the crypto industry, be it in the form of mining, custody, blockchain infrastructure, or digital payments. Stocks are weighted in the index by their modified average daily trading volume ((ADV)). This means that companies are prioritized for their liquidity rather than market cap. As is common with a thematic ETF, its holdings are fairly concentrated, with its top 10 holdings accounting for 69.32% of its total portfolio. The fund has an expense ratio of 0.40% as well as a dividend yield of 0.97%. Seeking Alpha Outlook FDIG looks attractive at first glance. The fund has a P/E of 24.74. This is contrasted with substantial EPS growth forecasts for its top six holdings, with an average expected jump in EPS of 32.03% and a median increase of 28.84%. Thus, from the perspective of price/earnings-to-growth, its attractively priced relative to its forward growth potential. Company EPS Growth Forecast (2025 vs. 2024) COIN (Coinbase) 49.93% MARA (Marathon) N/A RIOT (Riot Platforms) N/A CLSK (CleanSpark) 20.49% XYZ (Block) 34.48% HOOD (Robinhood) 23.22 Average 32.03% Median 28.84% The common denominator that drives earnings for FDIG's holdings is Bitcoin's price discovery. During bull markets such as today, traders spend more on fees, mining is more profitable, and more users are attracted to the utility of digital payments. FDIG has a positive correlation to Bitcoin's price, so what Bitcoin does next can be reasonably assumed to be a leading indicator for the fund's performance moving forward. Data by YCharts Bitcoin is cyclical and is presently in a strong bull run. Analysts estimate that we're between 640 and 975 days into the upwards cycle. Based on historical patterns before a correction arrives, bull cycles have lasted around 1,000 to 1,200 days. The consensus from analysts suggests that we're currently mid-to-late in Bitcoin's current bull cycle, which suggests that Bitcoin could peak sometime between October this year and mid-2026 at the latest. This suggests that we are not yet at the peak, and that there is real upside still left to be gained while Bitcoin remains structurally strong. There may be a lack of a strong, obvious catalyst on the horizon for Bitcoin (such as an upcoming halving event, next due in 2028), but there are still some clear and powerful structural elements that I believe will sustain its upward trajectory. Trump and Vance's White House administration are explicitly backing Bitcoin through proposed reserve allocations as well as through the GENIUS Act and market structure bills. Then there's also the continued dedollarisation in countries like China, Russia, and Iran, which helped to ignite gold's historic rally over the past year, driven by central bank purchases. As tensions rise between the U.S. and its rivals, I foresee that U.S. treasuries will continue to be sold in favor of alternative assets, which opens the door for Bitcoin to be more heavily considered. These are the two main reasons, in my view, that Bitcoin will maintain structural support. Comparative Analysis FDIG is not the strongest performer when examined in a universe with its peers. However, it has the lowest expense ratio at 0.40%, a mid-range one-year return, and a lower volatility than its peers, which have more mining exposure. ETF Expense Ratio (%) 1Y Return (%) 1M Return (%) 3M Return (%) 6M Return (%) YTD Return (%) FDIG 0.4 31.09 15.98 47.01 7.4 21.08 BITQ 0.85 53.61 14.65 51.31 7.42 26.05 WGMI 0.75 23.13 36.34 82.42 1.3 19.69 BKCH 0.5 20.03 26.95 60.09 -0.05 20.31 DAPP 0.51 50.49 17.99 71.99 8.48 27.35 BLOK 0.73 68 12.48 51.26 23.43 40.89 Over the past five years, FDIG returned 64.95%, while BLOK returned 167.83%. Additionally, BLOK's drawdowns were not substantially worse over the past five years, and it managed to seriously outperform FDIG on rallies, leading to its outperformance. FDIG then is an ETF to compare against, but in my peer universe of thematically similar ETFs, BLOK is the clear winner unless one wants to go with pure Bitcoin exposure and not touch equities at all. Bitcoin has gained 906.97% over the past five years. FDIG's performance is therefore underwhelming. Its construction using modified average daily trading volume ((ADV)) aims to reduce volatility, but in doing so, it also limits the fund's performance to participate in strong rallies. Over the past five years, FDIG has returned less on a risk-adjusted basis relative to BLOK (a Sharpe ratio of 1.45 for FDIG vs 2.56 for BLOK), thus making its fund construction self-defeating in this single yet crucial dimension. It's self-defeating because investors can get similar exposure to BLOK with far more historical upside and better risk-adjusted returns. Seeking Alpha Risks Although we may be in the heat of a bull cycle, Bitcoin has historically topped out and corrected hard when bulls lose enthusiasm. It's entirely possible that Bitcoin will peak later this year rather than mid-2026, which could lead to a rapid drawdown. The same correlation to Bitcoin that gives these ETFs their explosive potential can also act as a strong liability during risk-off scenarios. The second main risk is that although FDIG's P/E of 24.74 seems attractive when compared with the projected EPS growth of its top holdings, this growth is largely speculative and driven largely by the assumption that a bull market will continue for the foreseeable future. A drawdown could compress these multiples sharply, and then suddenly the fund seems far less attractive on a forward basis. Takeaway FDIG is a decent performer, but when compared with the price and risk-adjusted returns of BLOK or holding pure Bitcoin (such as through IBIT), it fails to live up to my expectations of asymmetric upside. FDIG is a hold if investors believe that the crypto market will drift sideways due to its expense ratio. But if one thinks there's still upside left, then BLOK or holding pure Bitcoin are better growth-oriented options. The market would need to grow very slowly in order or stay range-bound for FDIG's present strategy to be superior to its peers, and that seems unlikely given how fast crypto companies are expected to grow in the next year alone.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4805414-fdig-the-underwhelming-underachiever?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|FIAT","FDIG",cryptocompare

2025-07-29T12:46:00,"Cardano price prediction 2025-2031: Will ADA recover to $3 soon?","Key takeaways : Cardano’s price is expected to surpass $1 in 2025. By 2028, ADA/USD could reach $2.63. By 2031, Cardano might reach a maximum price of $8.61 Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. Designed for decentralized applications and smart contracts, it uses Ouroboros—a unique, energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Cardano’s two-layer architecture separates transactions from smart contracts, enhancing scalability and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance, allowing holders to influence the platform’s future. Emphasizing a research-driven, peer-reviewed development approach, Cardano aims to tackle blockchain challenges like scalability and sustainability, making it a strong alternative to platforms like Ethereum. Perhaps you’re wondering: with its innovative technology, can Cardano’s ADA reach new all-time highs soon? Let’s uncover what the future holds for Cardano. Overview Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $0.8058 Market Cap $1.2B Trading Volume (24-hour) $889.5M Circulating Supply 35.4B ADA All-time High $3.10 on Sept 02, 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on Oct 01, 2017 24-hour High $0.8381 24-hour Low $0.7817 Cardano price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) $ 1.020312 (27.00%) 50-day SMA $ 0.679134 14-Day RSI 56.66 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 73 (Greed) Green Days 21/30 (67%) 200-day SMA $ 0.610757 Cardano (ADA) price analysis Cardano is consolidating after a recent bullish rally with signs of indecision on the daily chart Momentum is weakening and price hovers near key support and mid-Bollinger band levels A breakout above $0.85 is possible if buying pressure returns otherwise a drop to $0.78 may occur Cardano price analysis 1-day chart: Cardano Faces Resistance After Rally as Price Stalls Near $0.85 Zone Based on the 1-day chart for Cardano (ADA) on July 29, the price is currently testing support at the midline of the Bollinger Bands around $0.7947 after a strong rally toward the $0.90 range. The candles are exhibiting a mild consolidation phase, with the recent green candle suggesting slight bullish interest. ADAUSD 1-day price chart by TradingView However, the MACD histogram shows declining momentum with the MACD line crossing below the signal, indicating a weakening bullish trend. The Balance of Power at 0.46 supports lingering buying pressure. If support holds, ADA may retest $0.85, but if breached, a move toward the lower band around $0.67 could be expected. ADA price analysis 4-hour chart: ADA Price Action Stabilizes Near $0.81 After Rebound from Local Support Based on the 4-hour chart for Cardano (ADA), the price is currently stabilizing around $0.808 after a recent pullback from the $0.90 resistance area. Bollinger Bands are slightly narrowing, indicating reduced volatility, while the RSI at 45.62 signals a neutral to slightly bearish sentiment with no overbought or oversold pressure ADAUSD 4-hour price chart by TradingView The MACD remains below the signal line with a slight downward curve, suggesting persistent bearish momentum. However, the price is attempting to hold above the middle Bollinger Band, which may offer temporary support. If momentum strengthens, ADA could retest $0.84, while failure to hold support risks a drop toward $0.79. ADA technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.751233 BUY SMA 5 $ 0.799978 BUY SMA 10 $ 0.830368 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.786796 BUY SMA 50 $ 0.679134 BUY SMA 100 $ 0.702772 BUY SMA 200 $ 0.610757 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.749931 BUY EMA 5 $ 0.718983 BUY EMA 10 $ 0.694069 BUY EMA 21 $ 0.686684 BUY EMA 50 $ 0.713869 BUY EMA 100 $ 0.747688 BUY EMA 200 $ 0.723228 BUY What to expect from the Cardano price analysis next? Based on the price action observed in both the 1-day and 4-hour charts of Cardano (ADA), the market reflects a phase of consolidation following a recent bullish run. On the 1-day chart, ADA is hovering around $0.81 after a sharp rise, with candles showing indecision and testing the middle Bollinger Band, suggesting potential for either a continuation upward or a corrective pullback. The MACD hints at weakening bullish momentum. In the 4-hour chart, price action is choppy, consolidating around support, with no strong breakout direction. If buying volume increases, ADA could retest $0.85. Otherwise, a slide toward $0.78 remains likely. Is Cardano a good investment? Cardano (ADA) presents a mixed investment opportunity. It is a third-generation blockchain that aims to solve scalability issues and enhance security through its Proof-of-Stake mechanism. While some analysts predict significant price increases by 2030, others caution that it remains a high-risk investment due to the volatile nature of the crypto market. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and research before investing, as Cardano’s future performance is uncertain and contingent on market conditions and technological advancements. Will Cardano recover? Cardano’s recovery potential depends on market sentiment and adoption. Despite past challenges, its projected price increase in 2025, potentially reaching $1, has significantly bolstered confidence in the coin’s future. Will Cardano reach $5? Cardano hitting $5 seems quite achievable given past levels. With its ATH around $3.10, $5 would only need to beat that peak by about 60%. A solid bull run and some serious adoption could usher in a unit price of $5. Will Cardano reach $10? Cardano hitting $10 is a long shot. Its all-time high was around $3.10 back in 2021, so $10 would mean more than tripling that peak. From current prices, that’s over a 13x jump. While crypto can be unpredictable, that would need massive adoption and a bull run far beyond what we saw in 2021. Will Cardano reach $50? Cardano hitting $50 is extremely unlikely. With ADA’s current supply of around 35 billion tokens, a $50 price would require a market cap of approximately $1.75 trillion. Even in crypto’s craziest bull runs, that kind of valuation doesn’t happen for altcoins. What is the Cardano forecast for 2040? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2040 is highly speculative as it depends on multiple factors, including adoption, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and macroeconomic conditions. However, if Cardano continues its development in smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and blockchain efficiency, it could see widespread adoption, driving its price higher. Some optimistic projections suggest that ADA could reach double-digit prices, possibly ranging from $10 to $50 or more. However, in a bearish scenario, where regulatory hurdles and competition slow its progress, ADA could struggle to maintain high valuations. What will be the future price of Cardano in 2050? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2050 is highly speculative, but if blockchain adoption continues to grow and Cardano successfully scales its smart contract ecosystem, its price could see significant appreciation. What that number will be remains to be seen. Does Cardano have a good long-term future? Cardano (ADA) has the potential for a positive long-term future, primarily driven by its technological advancements and growing ecosystem. The platform’s unique features, such as its focus on scalability and partnerships with various institutions, position it well for future adoption. However, its success will depend on overcoming regulatory scrutiny and developer engagement challenges.

By 2026, Cardano’s price could trade at a maximum of $2.45. Cardano’s historic price sentiment Cardano price history by Coingecko Cardano was founded in 2015 and went live in 2017. It initially gained investor support and popularity for being affordable and environmentally friendly due to its unique PoS mechanism called Ouroboros. In 2021, Cardano implemented the smart contract feature with the Alonzo update. This update came on the ADA test network and brought the interoperability and scalability that was promised to the users earlier. The ADA price reached its all-time high during the bullish cycle of 2021 when it hit $3.09. However, its price started plummeting at the beginning of September 2021 and reached a low of $0.220 in June 2023. In 2024, Cardano peaked at $0.810 in March before dropping to $0.401 in April due to heavy selling. It traded between $0.52–$0.401 in April and $0.317–$0.423 by July, with strong support at $0.33 in August. After peaking at $0.37 in September and dipping to $0.33 in November, ADA surged to $1.1999 at the start of December, hit a maximum price of $1.3264, and closed the year at $0.8451. Cardano (ADA) started 2025 trading between $1.02-$1.09 in January but declined to $0.9 by month-end, then continued falling through February and March, reaching lows around $0.60. In April, ADA dropped below $0.55 before surging back to $0.7030, then skyrocketed to $0.8 in early May before settling at $0.7599 by month-end. Throughout June 2025, ADA traded between $0.513-$0.705. In July, the coin is trading between $0.7777 and $0.8287.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/cardano-price-prediction/,"ADA|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|ETH|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|FORKS","Crypto Price Predictions|ADA",cryptocompare
2025-07-29T12:40:10,"Bitcoin Reserve Strategy: ZOOZ Power’s Bold $180M Move Unlocks Crypto Potential","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Reserve Strategy: ZOOZ Power’s Bold $180M Move Unlocks Crypto Potential The corporate world is increasingly turning its gaze towards digital assets, and ZOOZ Power is making headlines with its audacious plan to establish a significant Bitcoin Reserve Strategy . This isn’t just another funding round; it’s a strategic pivot that could redefine how companies manage their treasuries in the digital age. For anyone tracking the convergence of traditional finance and the burgeoning crypto market, this development from a Nasdaq-listed entity is nothing short of fascinating. ZOOZ Power’s Vision: Unpacking the Bold Bitcoin Reserve Strategy In a move that has captured the attention of both traditional and crypto investors, Nasdaq-listed ZOOZ Power has announced its intention to raise a substantial $180 million. This capital infusion isn’t for typical operational expansion; instead, it’s earmarked specifically to fund an ambitious Bitcoin Reserve Strategy . The funding will be secured through a Private Investment in Public Equity (PIPE) transaction, involving the issuance of 180 million ordinary shares and pre-funded warrants, each priced at $1.00. This significant financial maneuver is, however, contingent upon securing shareholder approval, underscoring the company’s commitment to transparency and governance in this pioneering endeavor. The decision to allocate such a considerable sum towards a Bitcoin Reserve Strategy signals a profound shift in corporate treasury management, moving beyond traditional fiat currencies and conventional investment vehicles. It reflects a growing recognition among forward-thinking companies of Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value, an inflation hedge, and a strategic asset in an increasingly digitized global economy. Why a Bitcoin Reserve Strategy Now? Understanding the Motivation Why would a company like ZOOZ Power, primarily known for its ultra-fast electric vehicle charging solutions, venture into the volatile world of cryptocurrencies? The answer lies in a confluence of macroeconomic factors and a bold vision for the future of corporate finance. For years, companies have sought stable, high-yield assets for their treasury reserves. However, with persistent inflation concerns, low-interest rates on traditional holdings, and the unpredictable nature of global markets, many are seeking alternative strategies. A Bitcoin Reserve Strategy offers several compelling advantages: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins makes it a scarce asset, often dubbed ‘digital gold.’ This scarcity can protect purchasing power against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury can diversify asset holdings, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk by introducing an asset class with a low correlation to traditional markets. Potential for Appreciation: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has demonstrated significant long-term growth potential, offering companies an opportunity for substantial capital appreciation on their reserves. Innovation and Forward-Thinking: Adopting a Bitcoin Reserve Strategy positions a company as innovative and technologically savvy, appealing to a new generation of investors and talent. This move echoes the pioneering steps taken by companies like MicroStrategy, which famously adopted Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset, demonstrating the viability and potential benefits of such a strategy for publicly traded companies. The Powerhouse Investors: Who’s Backing This Bold Bitcoin Reserve Strategy? The credibility of ZOOZ Power’s Bitcoin Reserve Strategy is significantly bolstered by the caliber of strategic investors participating in the PIPE offering. This isn’t just any group of investors; it’s a who’s who of prominent names in the cryptocurrency and venture capital space, signaling strong institutional confidence in the company’s new direction. Pantera Capital: A leading blockchain-focused investment firm, known for its early and significant investments in the crypto ecosystem. Their involvement speaks volumes about the perceived potential. FalconX: A prime brokerage for institutional crypto trading, their participation highlights the growing institutional demand for digital assets and the professional execution capabilities required for such a strategy. Arrington Capital: Founded by TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington, this firm is a well-respected name in blockchain and crypto investments, further validating the strategic shift. UTXO Management: A firm specifically focused on Bitcoin investments, their participation directly aligns with and reinforces the core of ZOOZ Power’s Bitcoin Reserve Strategy . ATW Partners and Alex Rabinovitch: These participants bring additional strategic capital and expertise, rounding out a formidable consortium of backers. The collective involvement of these sophisticated investors is a powerful endorsement, indicating that ZOOZ Power’s move is not merely speculative but a well-considered financial and strategic decision with significant backing from those deeply entrenched in the digital asset space. Jordan Fried: Steering the Digital Asset Ship for the Bitcoin Reserve Strategy Further cementing its commitment to this new direction, ZOOZ Power has announced that Jordan Fried will join as CEO on July 31. Fried’s appointment is particularly significant as he is set to lead the company’s digital asset treasury, making him the key architect and executor of the new Bitcoin Reserve Strategy . His background in the blockchain and digital asset space is expected to provide the necessary expertise and vision to navigate the complexities of managing a significant crypto reserve. Fried’s leadership will be crucial in implementing robust security protocols, managing market volatility, ensuring regulatory compliance, and optimizing the performance of the Bitcoin holdings. His role underscores the specialized knowledge required to successfully integrate digital assets into traditional corporate finance frameworks, moving beyond mere speculation to a structured, long-term strategic asset management approach. Navigating the Crypto Waters: Challenges and Considerations for a Bitcoin Reserve Strategy While the potential benefits of a Bitcoin Reserve Strategy are compelling, it’s crucial to acknowledge the inherent challenges and risks. Bitcoin’s price volatility remains a significant concern for corporate treasuries, which typically prioritize stability and liquidity. A sudden downturn in Bitcoin’s value could impact a company’s balance sheet and investor confidence. Other challenges include: Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Changes in regulations could impact the legality of holding digital assets, their tax treatment, or their liquidity. Custody and Security: Storing significant amounts of Bitcoin securely requires specialized expertise to protect against hacking, theft, or loss of private keys. Accounting and Reporting: Integrating Bitcoin into traditional accounting frameworks presents complexities, particularly concerning impairment testing and fair value accounting. Public Perception: Some traditional investors might view a crypto-heavy treasury as overly risky or speculative, potentially affecting stock performance or access to traditional financing. ZOOZ Power’s success with its Bitcoin Reserve Strategy will depend heavily on its ability to mitigate these risks through comprehensive risk management frameworks, secure custody solutions, and clear communication with shareholders and regulators. A New Era for Corporate Treasuries? What ZOOZ Power’s Move Means ZOOZ Power’s bold step could signal a broader trend in corporate finance. As the digital economy expands and traditional financial systems face new pressures, more companies might explore a Bitcoin Reserve Strategy as a legitimate and strategic component of their treasury management. This isn’t just about investing in Bitcoin; it’s about acknowledging the fundamental shift in global finance and positioning a company to thrive in a decentralized future. This development will likely spur discussions across boardrooms worldwide, prompting finance executives to evaluate the merits of digital assets beyond speculative trading. It challenges conventional wisdom and encourages a re-evaluation of what constitutes a ‘safe’ or ‘optimal’ corporate treasury in the 21st century. ZOOZ Power is effectively contributing to the maturation of corporate crypto adoption, potentially paving the way for others to follow. Key Takeaways for Businesses Considering a Bitcoin Reserve Strategy For businesses contemplating their own foray into digital asset treasury management, ZOOZ Power’s case offers valuable insights: Strategic Intent is Key: A Bitcoin Reserve Strategy should be driven by clear strategic objectives, not just market hype. Due Diligence is Paramount: Thorough research into market dynamics, regulatory frameworks, and technological requirements is essential. Expertise Matters: Bringing in seasoned professionals like Jordan Fried or consulting with specialized firms is crucial for successful implementation and ongoing management. Risk Management Frameworks: Develop robust strategies to address volatility, security, and compliance risks. Shareholder Communication: Transparently communicate the rationale and risks of the strategy to shareholders to maintain trust and support. The journey into digital asset treasuries is complex, but with careful planning and expert guidance, it can unlock new avenues for financial resilience and growth. Conclusion: A Strategic Shift Towards Digital Assets ZOOZ Power’s decision to raise $180 million for a Bitcoin Reserve Strategy marks a significant moment in the evolving landscape of corporate finance. Backed by a consortium of leading crypto investors and spearheaded by a new CEO with deep digital asset expertise, this move positions ZOOZ Power at the forefront of a potentially transformative trend. While challenges undoubtedly exist, the strategic rationale for integrating Bitcoin into corporate treasuries is becoming increasingly clear. This bold step by ZOOZ Power is more than just an investment; it’s a testament to the growing acceptance and strategic importance of digital assets in the global economy, potentially inspiring a new wave of corporate adoption and reshaping the future of treasury management.

RAKBANK has become the first traditional bank in the country to offer crypto trading through its mobile banking app. The new service lets customers buy, sell, and swap cryptocurrencies directly in AED with no need to convert to foreign currencies or use third-party exchanges. It’s powered by Bitpanda, a Europe-based crypto platform regulated in Dubai under VARA. Your Bank is Now Your Crypto Exchange Until now, most UAE users had to move funds to global platforms like Binance or Coinbase to trade. That process usually involved converting from dirhams to dollars, paying extra fees, and dealing with platforms outside the country’s regulatory scope. With RAKBANK’s new feature, that entire process is cut out. Users can now access crypto markets directly from their savings or current accounts, with trades executed and settled in dirhams. “We believe [customers] deserve a more efficient and seamless crypto buying, selling and swapping journey that is fully regulated and entirely in AED,” said Raheel Ahmed , RAKBANK Group CEO Bitpanda Adds Credibility and Compliance The service is being rolled out in partnership with Bitpanda Broker MENA DMCC, a VARA-regulated entity in Dubai. Bitpanda already works with major European institutions like Deutsche Bank and Raiffeisen Bank and is regulated in Austria and Germany. Calling the partnership a “big moment for digital assets in the region,” Bitpanda’s deputy CEO Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad highlighted the opportunity to bring simple, safe crypto access to mainstream users in the UAE. For now, the service is available by invitation only, with a full rollout expected in the coming months. Supported assets at launch include Bitcoin , Ethereum , Solana, and Ripple (XRP), with more to be added soon. UAE’s Crypto Momentum Keeps Building RAKBANK’s crypto launch fits into the UAE’s wider push to become a global crypto hub. Over 600 crypto firms are already operating in Dubai’s DMCC free zone. The country has also been quick to approve innovations like Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin . By being the first bank in the region to offer direct, regulated retail access to crypto, RAKBANK may have just set a new standard and likely started a trend that other banks in the region won’t want to miss.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/rakbank-becomes-first-uae-bank-to-launch-retail-crypto-trading-details/,"FIAT|TRADING|EXCHANGE|BNB|BTC","News",cryptocompare

It has extended the review deadline to September 18. SEC Delays Decision on Truth Social Bitcoin ETF The Truth Social ETF, backed by the Trump Media and Technology Group, seeks SEC approval to be listed on the NYSE Arca Exchange. The fund application was submitted on June 3 and is still in the early stages. Originally, the decision-making on Truth Social Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) was set to release on August 4. However, the SEC delayed the review period by 45 days. The agency said that the extended period will allow them to review the proposal and consider public comments. The SEC wrote in the notice , “The Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein.” Crypto Ties and Political Concerns Jumble President Trump has doubled his wealth in a year with his crypto ties. If the SEC approves the Truth Social ETF, it will become the first crypto-related fund tied to a US president. Many democrats have voiced their concerns. Some crypto experts even said that Trump’s ties with cryptocurrency could cause a conflict of interest. Senator Jeff Merkley said , “Allowing Trump to create a Bitcoin ETF is opening the door to abuse of power. He can influence the regulation and then profit from it.” SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, but now it is delaying the decision for the Truth Social ETF. This reflects its hesitation about broader challenges in the crypto regulatory space. Additionally, Grayscale’s proposed conversion of its Solana Trust into an ETF is now pushed to October 10 for SEC approval.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/etf-news-today-sec-extends-deadline-of-truth-social-bitcoin-etf-to-september-18/,"REGULATION|BTC|EXCHANGE|SOL|BUSINESS","News",cryptocompare

The Cardano network has lagged in DeFi growth compared to its top competitors like Solana and Tron. The ADA/USD pair has signaled bullish sentiment following the recent rebound from 52 cents. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has issued a bold new price prediction for both his native token, ADA, and the market leader, Bitcoin (BTC). In a recent interview, Hoskinson stated that ADA might record a 100x or even 1000x gain, whereas Bitcoin’s price may only see a 10x increase in the near future. Hoskinson was responding to a question about why the Cardano treasury did not convert its ADA holdings to Bitcoin. He argued that Bitcoin’s massive $2.3 trillion valuation is a hindrance to its potential for high-percentage gains when compared to Cardano’s much smaller $29.1 billion market cap. “Oh sure, let’s sell ADA for Bitcoin. So we can make less money,” Hoskinson noted sarcastically. For context, a 100x for Cardano would give it a market cap of $2.9 trillion, while a 10x for Bitcoin would push its valuation to $23 trillion.

More than a milestone in renewable energy, this project marks the official launch of PowerBank’s Bitcoin treasury strategy. “This is a pivotal moment for PowerBank,” said Dr. Richard Lu, President and CEO. “Geddes isn’t just our largest U.S. asset—it’s our launchpad into a bold, dual-track strategy that fuses clean energy leadership with financial innovation. By deploying net cash generated by this project into Bitcoin, we are enhancing the value of our operating assets while aligning ourselves with a future-focused monetary reserve model.” A Strategic Inflection Point – Energy + Bitcoin: Pioneering Treasury Strategy. Geddes is the first of potentially several PowerBank projects to support a digital asset reserve model, giving the Company exposure to Bitcoin as a non-correlated, asymmetric upside asset. Financial Flexibility . This approach allows PowerBank to retain earnings from high-performance assets like Geddes in a store of value with long-term appreciation potential. Environmental Transformation . By converting a capped landfill into a clean power station, PowerBank demonstrates how sustainability and innovation can converge for long-term value creation. Scalability . The Company is actively assessing expansion of this Bitcoin treasury strategy across additional solar and battery energy storage projects in its IPP (Independent Power Producer) portfolio. The Geddes Solar Power Operation Built on a repurposed landfill, the Geddes Project now delivers 3.79 MW of clean, renewable energy — enough to power approximately 450 homes annually — while transforming an underutilized site into a productive asset. But its value extends beyond green power. Net cash flows from the project will be allocated, at management’s discretion, to the acquisition of Bitcoin, creating a hybrid strategy that blends energy generation with strategic digital asset investment. Capacity: 3.79 MW DC Type: Utility-scale ground-mounted solar Location: Former landfill site in Geddes, New York Off-take: Local grid, supporting community energy needs Impact: Powers approximately 450 homes annually Solar Simplified handles all customer-facing activities for the Company’s community solar projects, allowing it to focus on developing and expanding its renewable energy portfolio. Solar Simplified’s expertise in acquisition, enrollment, and management ensures full project subscription and maximized revenue from day one. With a business model that aligns seamlessly with the Company’s, this partnership drives sustainable growth, enabling the Company to accelerate development, bring more projects online each year, and create greater value for its business and the communities served by the Company. Additional Information: Bitcoin purchases will be funded through excess cash generated by the Geddes Project, after meeting all capital expenditures, debt service obligations, and operational requirements. Timing, size, and frequency of purchases will be determined by market conditions, Bitcoin pricing, cash needs, and regulatory factors. No Bitcoin has been purchased as of the date of this release. Custody and security frameworks are currently under evaluation and will be finalized prior to any acquisitions.

2025-07-29T12:18:07,"PowerBank’s 3.79 MW Geddes Solar Project Goes Live, Powering New Bitcoin Treasury Strategy","Toronto, Ontario, Canada, July 29th, 2025, Chainwire PowerBank Corporation (NASDAQ: SUUN; Cboe CA: SUNN, FSE: 103), a leader in distributed solar energy, battery storage, and clean energy infrastructure across North America, is excited to announce that its largest owned-and-operated asset in the U.S.—the 3.79 MW Geddes Solar Power Project in New York State—is now fully operational. More than a milestone in renewable energy, this project marks the official launch of PowerBank’s Bitcoin treasury strategy. “This is a pivotal moment for PowerBank,” said Dr. Richard Lu, President and CEO. “Geddes isn’t just our largest U.S. asset—it’s our launchpad into a bold, dual-track strategy that fuses clean energy leadership with financial innovation. By deploying net cash generated by this project into Bitcoin, we are enhancing the value of our operating assets while aligning ourselves with a future-focused monetary reserve model.” A Strategic Inflection Point – Energy + Bitcoin: Pioneering Treasury Strategy. Geddes is the first of potentially several PowerBank projects to support a digital asset reserve model, giving the Company exposure to Bitcoin as a non-correlated, asymmetric upside asset. Financial Flexibility. This approach allows PowerBank to retain earnings from high-performance assets like Geddes in a store of value with long-term appreciation potential. Environmental Transformation. By converting a capped landfill into a clean power station, PowerBank demonstrates how sustainability and innovation can converge for long-term value creation. Scalability. The Company is actively assessing expansion of this Bitcoin treasury strategy across additional solar and battery energy storage projects in its IPP (Independent Power Producer) portfolio. The Geddes Solar Power Operation Built on a repurposed landfill, the Geddes Project now delivers 3.79 MW of clean, renewable energy — enough to power approximately 450 homes annually — while transforming an underutilized site into a productive asset. But its value extends beyond green power. Net cash flows from the project will be allocated, at management’s discretion, to the acquisition of Bitcoin, creating a hybrid strategy that blends energy generation with strategic digital asset investment. Capacity: 3.79 MW DC Type: Utility-scale ground-mounted solar Location: Former landfill site in Geddes, New York Off-take: Local grid, supporting community energy needs Impact: Powers approximately 450 homes annually Solar Simplified handles all customer-facing activities for the Company’s community solar projects, allowing it to focus on developing and expanding its renewable energy portfolio. Solar Simplified’s expertise in acquisition, enrollment, and management ensures full project subscription and maximized revenue from day one. With a business model that aligns seamlessly with the Company’s, this partnership drives sustainable growth, enabling the Company to accelerate development, bring more projects online each year, and create greater value for its business and the communities served by the Company. Additional Information: Bitcoin purchases will be funded through excess cash generated by the Geddes Project, after meeting all capital expenditures, debt service obligations, and operational requirements. Timing, size, and frequency of purchases will be determined by market conditions, Bitcoin pricing, cash needs, and regulatory factors. No Bitcoin has been purchased as of the date of this release. Custody and security frameworks are currently under evaluation and will be finalized prior to any acquisitions.

On-Chain Signals Hint at a Bitcoin Turning Point appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin is holding steady around $118,000, showing resilience despite growing market concerns. But a series of large transfers by Galaxy Digital have sparked fresh concerns. Could a sell-off be coming? Let’s dive in. Galaxy Digital Moves $447M in Bitcoin, Community on Edge In a latest development, on-chain data shows that Galaxy Digital has moved 3,782 Bitcoins worth $447 million to several wallets in the past 12 hours. The bulk of these transfers were to major crypto exchanges, which have sparked fears in the crypto community. Is Galaxy Digital all set to facilitate another round of Bitcoin selling? Is #GalaxyDigital helping clients sell $BTC again? In the past 12 hours, GalaxyDigital has transferred out another 3,782 $BTC ($447M), most of which went to exchanges. https://t.co/lD8tgkBx00 https://t.co/u8s0VjLG5p pic.twitter.com/4wqf8DZx2y — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 29, 2025 One of the transactions involved 450 BTC in a single move. Galaxy hasn’t released an official comment yet, but the size and timing of the transfers have sparked fresh speculation about a potential sale. Bitcoin Price Remains Stable, For Now Despite the noise, Bitcoin hasn’t moved much. It’s currently trading at $118,217, down just 0.4% in the past 24 hours. This is a sharp contrast to last week, when Galaxy moved $9 billion worth of BTC from a dormant wallet dating back to the Satoshi era, pushing prices briefly down to $116,000. The fact that Bitcoin held its ground this time shows more stability in the market, but investors remain cautious. Long-Term Holders Begin Taking Profits Near $120K A Cryptoquant analyst points out that long-term Bitcoin holders (LTHs) have turned net negative right as BTC approaches the key $120,000 resistance, which is a strong psychological level. This shift suggests some seasoned investors may be locking in profits after holding through multiple market cycles. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : The U.S Seizes $2.4M in Bitcoin, May Add to Strategic Reserve , While Bitcoin’s overall selling is not a big concern yet, Galaxy Digital’s huge sale of 80,000 BTC stands out. The analyst notes that this is a clear example of institutional-level profit-taking. Will other large holders follow Galaxy’s lead? Or is it simply a strategic decision to cash in after Bitcoin’s strong rally? Whatever the case is, these actions could significantly shape Bitcoin’s direction in the coming weeks. Bitcoin Top Could Be Weeks Away On-chain data shows Bitcoin might be near a cycle top. The MVRV 365DMA is showing a pattern like 2021, just before the last big drop. If the pattern repeats, the peak could come in late August or early September. This also lines up with market expectations around Fed policy and macro shifts. The next Bitcoin $BTC top could be at $149,679! pic.twitter.com/knZXTdjKve — Ali (@ali_charts) July 29, 2025 Analysts note that Bitcoin has once again closed the CME futures gap on Monday, marking the sixth week in a row.

2025-07-29T12:16:53,"PowerBank’s 3.79 MW Geddes Solar Project Goes Live, Powering New Bitcoin Treasury Strategy","Toronto, Ontario, Canada, July 29th, 2025, Chainwire PowerBank Corporation (NASDAQ: SUUN; Cboe CA: SUNN, FSE: 103) , a leader in distributed solar energy, battery storage, and clean energy infrastructure across North America, is excited to announce that its largest owned-and-operated asset in the U.S.—the 3.79 MW Geddes Solar Power Project in New York State—is now fully operational. More than a milestone in renewable energy, this project marks the official launch of PowerBank’s Bitcoin treasury strategy. “This is a pivotal moment for PowerBank,” said Dr. Richard Lu, President and CEO. “Geddes isn’t just our largest U.S. asset—it’s our launchpad into a bold, dual-track strategy that fuses clean energy leadership with financial innovation.

2025-07-29T12:16:31,"PowerBank’s 3.79 MW Geddes Solar Project Goes Live, Powering New Bitcoin Treasury Strategy","Toronto, Ontario, Canada, July 29th, 2025, Chainwire PowerBank Corporation (NASDAQ: SUUN; Cboe CA: SUNN, FSE: 103), a leader in distributed solar energy, battery storage, and clean energy infrastructure across North America, is excited to announce that its largest owned-and-operated asset in the U.S.—the 3.79 MW Geddes Solar Power Project in New York State—is now fully operational. More than a milestone in renewable energy, this project marks the official launch of PowerBank’s Bitcoin treasury strategy. “This is a pivotal moment for PowerBank,” said Dr. Richard Lu, President and CEO. “Geddes isn’t just our largest U.S. asset—it’s our launchpad into a bold, dual-track strategy that fuses clean energy leadership with financial innovation. By deploying net cash generated by this project into Bitcoin, we are enhancing the value of our operating assets while aligning ourselves with a future-focused monetary reserve model.” A Strategic Inflection Point – Energy + Bitcoin: Pioneering Treasury Strategy. Geddes is the first of potentially several PowerBank projects to support a digital asset reserve model, giving the Company exposure to Bitcoin as a non-correlated, asymmetric upside asset. Financial Flexibility. This approach allows PowerBank to retain earnings from high-performance assets like Geddes in a store of value with long-term appreciation potential. Environmental Transformation. By converting a capped landfill into a clean power station, PowerBank demonstrates how sustainability and innovation can converge for long-term value creation. Scalability. The Company is actively assessing expansion of this Bitcoin treasury strategy across additional solar and battery energy storage projects in its IPP (Independent Power Producer) portfolio. The Geddes Solar Power Operation Built on a repurposed landfill, the Geddes Project now delivers 3.79 MW of clean, renewable energy — enough to power approximately 450 homes annually — while transforming an underutilized site into a productive asset. But its value extends beyond green power. Net cash flows from the project will be allocated, at management’s discretion, to the acquisition of Bitcoin, creating a hybrid strategy that blends energy generation with strategic digital asset investment.

2025-07-29T12:13:08,"Journalist Nicknamed ""FED Spokesperson"" Speaks Clearly About FED's Interest Rate Decision Tomorrow! ""The Decision is Clear!""","Nick Timiraos, a Wall Street Journal reporter known as the FED spokesperson, shared his predictions for the July interest rate decision to be announced by the US Federal Reserve (FED) tomorrow. According to Nick Timiraos, the Fed will not cut interest rates tomorrow. “The Fed is Not Ready!” Nick Timiraos said the Fed is not ready to cut interest rates this week, citing internal divisions. Timiraos said authorities would eventually continue with interest rate cuts, but were not ready to do so this week. Timiraos said Fed officials agreed to postpone the reductions due to inflation concerns stemming from the tariffs. However, the prominent figure said that Fed members have differing views on how to interpret the evidence for a rate cut, given that inflation is running lower than expected and signs of loosening in the labor market are emerging. “Fed officials appear likely to continue cutting interest rates, but they are not ready for this meeting. What separates them is what evidence they will prioritize and whether it would be a mistake to wait for it. The Fed was united when concerns arose that inflation would rise again because of the tariffs, but as tariff-driven inflation turns out to be lower than expected and employment shows signs of easing, divisions are emerging within the Fed. FED Split into Three! At this point, the Fed is divided into three camps: 1. Patient Hawks advocate for keeping interest rates high for longer to ensure inflation remains on a downward trend. 2. Data-Based Centrists seek additional evidence that economic conditions are sufficient to warrant a rate cut. 3. Dovish Advocates advocate for earlier rate cuts to mitigate the risks of a labor market slowdown. Timiraos noted that two members are expected to vote against the interest rate decision, adding that markets will focus on whether Chairman Jerome Powell will signal a possible interest rate cut in his speech in September. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-29T12:00:39,"Elon Musk’s AI Has an Urgent Warning for XRP Holders","In a recent video shared on X, Levi Rietveld of Crypto Crusaders revealed a critical forecast from Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence platform, Grok, specifically directed at XRP holders. The AI issued an “urgent warning” about the current bull market , highlighting a potential cycle top in the coming months based on a convergence of historical trends, macroeconomic indicators, and Federal Reserve policy decisions. Grok’s Forecast Levi began by explaining the basis of his inquiry to Grok, asking the AI to analyze previous Bitcoin halving cycles alongside key geopolitical and economic factors. Grok responded with a detailed timeline, noting that Bitcoin historically peaks 12 to 18 months after each halving. Bitcoin’s past halvings have been followed by major price tops: the 2012 halving to the November 2013 peak, the 2016 halving to the December 2017 peak, and the 2020 halving to the November 2021 peak. Applying this pattern to the most recent halving in April 2024, Grok estimates a potential peak window between April and October 2025. BREAKING XRP NEWS: Elon Musk's AI Has A URGENT WARNING For You! #XRP pic.twitter.com/nsxQSGENMa — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) July 28, 2025 However, based on current conditions and anticipated policy shifts, Grok narrowed this estimate further. The AI predicts the cryptocurrency market will reach its peak sometime between July 1 and September 30, 2025. This updated forecast incorporates the possible impact of upcoming rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, global liquidity levels, and investor behavior leading into a distribution phase. Levi stressed the importance of this forecast, stating, “I think this is crucial… this is its synthesis and estimate.” The Role of the Federal Reserve and Interest Rates A significant part of Grok’s prediction rests on monetary policy. As of June 2025, the U.S. federal funds rate remains steady at 4.25% to 4.50%, following a 25 basis point (0.25%) rate cut in December 2024. Investors and policymakers alike are anticipating further rate reductions, possibly in July and September 2025. Levi noted that Grok, while limited in some real-time data, integrates historical responses to rate changes. For example, the Fed’s rapid rate hikes from 0% to 4.5% in 2022 triggered a severe crypto bear market, wiping 78% off Bitcoin’s value. Now, the potential for rate cuts could drive renewed investor confidence. Levi added, “Trump is fully aware that the midterm elections ride very heavily on strong market performance,” suggesting that political pressure may force the Fed’s hand. If rates are cut as expected, Grok’s July–September 2025 window remains intact. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Alternative Scenario To further test the forecast, Levi asked Grok what would happen if the Fed delays further easing until Q4 2025 and continues into Q1 2026. In this scenario, Grok projects a market top between January 1st and March 31st, 2026, pointing to a “cycle extension due to the Fed’s monetary policy and growing M2 during this period.” However, Levi expressed skepticism that other economies, such as China and the EU, can continue quantitative easing, noting their limited fiscal space. “Everybody starts waiting for the United States to start lowering those rates,” he said, reinforcing his belief that the Fed remains the primary driver of market liquidity. XRP Technical Outlook and Investor Strategy While the macro environment remains uncertain, Levi views current price levels as a favorable opportunity for XRP investors. “The stochastic RSI for XRP… is currently in the oversold category,” he said, suggesting that a short-term rally is likely. With XRP and Bitcoin hovering near major support levels, Levi disclosed that he has added to his futures position, anticipating another leg upward. Market Peak Depends on Fed Action Ultimately, Grok’s warning is grounded in data but shaped by uncertainty. If the Fed initiates rate cuts in the coming months, XRP and the broader market may peak between July and September 2025. If delays occur, that top could shift to early 2026. For XRP holders, timing entries and exits around these macroeconomic shifts could prove decisive in navigating this cycle successfully.

2025-07-29T12:00:33,"Bitcoin's Bollinger Bands Tightest Since February; XRP, SOL Establish Lower Highs","This is a daily analysis of top tokens with CME futures by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. Bitcoin: Bollinger bands tighten BTC's continued consolidation between $116,000 and $120,000 calls for renewed focus on Bollinger bands, which have now tightened to levels last seen before the late February volatility explosion that saw prices drop from $95,000 to $80,000 within days. Tighter bands indicate that the market is coiling up and building energy for a big move in either direction. Bollinger bands are volatility bands placed two standard deviations above and below the asset's 20-day simple moving average. This view is consistent with the VIX's bullish August seasonality that suggests heightened price turbulence for stocks and bitcoin over the coming four weeks. A break below $116,000 would imply downside volatility explosion, exposing the former resistance-turned-support at $111,965. Conversely, a quick move to new lifetime highs appears likely if tighter Bollinger bands resolve bullishly. AI's take: The significant contraction of volatility, especially after a strong uptrend, often signals that the price is coiling up for a large and potentially explosive move in the near future. Resistance: $120,000, $123,181. Support: $116,000-$117,000, $114,700, $111,965. XRP: Lower high established XRP fell 3.59% on Monday, creating a red candle with a prominent upper wick, suggesting seller dominance. The cryptocurrency printed a lower high at $3.33, the first since peaking at $3.65 with a bearish tweezer top pattern , indicating a potential deeper pullback ahead. This suggests that it's only a matter of time before the mini-ascending channel seen on the hourly chart gives way, exposing the recent low of $2.95 and possibly the May high of $2.65. The hurdle at $3.35 must be overcome to negate the bearish bias. AI's take: Traders should primarily focus on whether XRP can decisively reclaim and hold above the crucial $3.35 level, which now acts as immediate resistance. A failure to do so would reinforce the daily chart's bearish reversal signals (tweezer top, lower high), suggesting further downside, Resistance: $3.35, $3.65, $4.00. Support: $2.95, $2.65, $2.44 (the 200-day SMA). Ether: RSI diverging bearishly Ether's 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has diverged bearishly from the price, with the MACD histogram nearing a negative crossover confirmation. These developments suggest a potential pullback to the higher low of $3,510 registered on July 24. A violation there could extend the pullback toward $3,000. AI's take: Traders should primarily focus on the bearish divergence displayed by the RSI , which signals weakening momentum despite Ether's recent price high. Resistance: $4,000, $4100, $4,382. Support: $3,731 (daily low), $3,510, $3,000. Solana: XRP-like structure SOL established a lower high at $195, reinforcing the bearish tweezer top pattern at $205-$206. Additionally, the cryptocurrency has dived out of a mini-ascending channel and the Ichimoku cloud on the hourly chart, suggesting the path of least resistance is to the downside. The resistance at $195 needs to be topped to invalidate the bearish bias. AI's take: ""Tweezer Top"" candlestick pattern at the peak of the rally, immediately followed by the formation of a ""lower high"" is a powerful bearish reversal pattern, indicating that the strong upward momentum from July has likely ended Resistance: $195 , $205-$206, $218. Support: $184, $163, $126.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/29/bitcoin-s-bollinger-bands-tightest-since-february-xrp-sol-establish-lower-highs,"TRADING|BTC|MARKET|XRP|SOL","Markets|Bitcoin|Ether|XRP|Solana|Technical Analysis|Markets|News",cryptocompare
2025-07-29T12:00:28,"$1,000 In XRP Could Be The Best Bet Of The Decade, Analyst Suggests","According to market analyst Common Sense Crypto, a $1,000 bet on XRP today could turn into between $10,000 and $50,000 during this cycle. Related Reading: $120K Bitcoin In Sight: 90-Day US–China Tariff Truce Fuels Market Optimism He pointed out that the same stake in Bitcoin would likely top out at around $1,300–$1,500. That claim has caught the eye of many investors who are weighing where to put their crypto dollars. Strong ROI Comparison Common Sense Crypto ran the numbers. At XRP’s current price of $3.18, a $1,000 buy-in nets roughly 315 tokens. To hit $10k, each XRP would need to trade at $31.80. If XRP somehow climbed to $160, that small stake would swell to $50k. By contrast, a $1k purchase of Bitcoin at $120,000 today would only need BTC to rise to about $154k–$178k to yield the same $1,300–$1,500 returns. Here’s a quick fact to ponder, if you put $1,000 into $xrp today you will most likely end up with at least $10,000 – $50,000 in this cycle, if you put the same $1,000 into $btc you will most like only end up with $1300 – $1500. ROI (return on investment) is more important than… — Common Sense Crypto (@TheCSCrypto) July 12, 2025 Those are gains in the 30–50% range. This puts XRP’s upside in a very different league when viewed purely as percentages. Still, size matters. XRP’s market cap sits near $188 billion. Bitcoin’s floats around $2.37 trillion. To push XRP to $159, its valuation would need to balloon to roughly $9.5 trillion—nearly four times Bitcoin’s current size. That would require massive new inflows and adoption on a scale we’ve never seen in crypto. XRP Tops $3; CEO Sets Sights On 14% Of SWIFT Ripple’s XRP finally breached the long-awaited $3 mark after US President Donald Trump announced a new US strategic crypto reserve, including XRP and other digital assets​. As one of the most traded cryptocurrencies, XRP enjoys high daily trading volumes, ensuring price stability and ease of entry for institutional investors. Ripple’s chief executive, Brad Garlinghouse, predicts that within five years, Ripple will handle about 14% of SWIFT’s worldwide cross‑border transaction flows. Related Reading: Countdown To August 15: What XRP Investors Need To Know Past Cycle Performance Other voices have made similar points. In June, Edoardo Farina of Alpha Lions Academy noted that between November 2024 and January 2025, XRP jumped from $0.50 to $3.40. That’s a 7x return in just two months. Bitcoin, in that same window, climbed from $68k to $112k, a 60% gain. Farina calculated that $50k in XRP would have grown to $340k while the same investment in Bitcoin would have become about $82,352. The XRP 50x Challenge XRP’s promise of turning $1,000 into as much as $50,000 is eye‑catching. Its past leap from $0.50 to $3.40 in just two months shows what’s possible. But growing its market cap from $188 billion to $9.5 trillion means a tidal wave of new money and clear legal rules.

2025-07-29T12:00:21,"Ethereum: BitMine’s Bold $60K ETH Call Fails To Offset Stock Slide","Ethereum is on the spotlight as BitMine Immersion Technologies stock took a sharp hit on Monday, falling over 25% despite a fresh round of bullish messaging from Tom Lee of FundStrat. Investors seemed unconvinced by the plan to make BitMine a major holder and staker of Ethereum . The dip came after shares slid over 10% during regular hours to $35, then dropped another 15% in after‑hours trading. Ethereum: BitMine Shares Plunge Despite Big Claims According to FundStrat’s Tom Lee, BitMine plans to hold 5% of Ethereum’s total supply and become a “made in America validator network.” He highlighted that BitMine already has 600,000 ETH on its balance sheet—worth more than $2 billion at current prices. Lee even floated the idea that Ether could reach an implied valuation of $60,000, citing unnamed research firms. But those bold figures failed to calm the market. 10/18We asked several research firms to give us “replacement” value (of Wall Street) to value ETH – this is for illustrative purposes only– implied value for ETH is $60,000– ETH currently ~$3,800 pic.twitter.com/mXa5uCZukv — Bitmine BMNR (@BitMNR) July 28, 2025 Analysts had pointed out that BitMine’s stock had wildly surged earlier this month. The price shot up more than 3,000% to a yearly high of $135 on July 3 after the initial announcement of the Ether‑buying strategy. That rally was met with a wave of profit‑taking once the plan was fully laid out. Many traders sold into the strength, and the mood shifted quickly when shareholders saw the fine print. Investors Question Execution Risks Based on reports from Kronos Research, treasury rollouts on this scale require a solid plan to protect capital and maintain liquidity. Vincent Liu, Kronos’s chief investment officer, warned that without clear steps for custody and staking infrastructure, holding large amounts of Ether could create big swings in value. And those swings spooked some investors when Lee’s “Chairman’s Message” failed to pin down exact timelines or reveal audit partners. On top of that, the implied $60,000 target for Ether came from sources that remain unnamed. That lack of transparency set off alarm bells. Investors want to know who did the math and whether the data holds up under scrutiny. When price targets are presented without clear attribution, doubt grows fast. Corporate Ethereum Bets On The Rise Meanwhile, other firms are also loading up on Ether. SharpLink Gaming controls 438,000 ETH. Bit Digital holds over 100,000 ETH. Blockchain Technology Consensus Solutions recently boosted its stake to 29,122 ETH after raising $62 million. Finality Capital’s partner David Grider compared the trend to Strategy’s big bet on Bitcoin—saying these moves should help ETH flows and price action.

2025-07-29T12:00:00,"Ethereum's Success Won't Translate Into Altcoins","Summary Ether’s recent price gains have market pundits predicting an impending Altcoin Season. Altcoin’s are “oscillators at best” and two ingredients for their success are missing. Cryptocurrency deregulation will benefit Ethereum more than Bitcoin. The Dencun and Pectra upgrades sharply lowered fees going to the L1 and increased ETH’s inflation. Ethereum is an institutional-gradeblockchain with several unique bullish factors. Thesis: Investor sentiment for Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) shifted dramatically from depressed and apathetic to enthusiastic. The recent drop in Bitcoin Dominance alongside strong positive momentum for Ethereum has translated to predictions of an Altcoin Season. This makes complete sense given that ETH is the Altcoin market’s 600lb gorilla. And as the saying goes, “so goes ETH, so goes the Altcoin market.” However, this time is different, as we’re missing two pieces of the puzzle. This article discusses my Rating Scorecard, trends within Ethereum, why ETH could perform well without an Altcoin Season and how we can get to the “banana zone” in crypto. Introduction Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) is a distributed blockchain platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications. Ethereum’s smart contracts have enabled the creation of various new assets and industries such as Decentralized Finance ( DEFI ), NFTs and DAOs (for governance)…Ethereum uses a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism where validators secure the network and participate in block production. Ratings Framework Ethereum is rated highly under my Ratings Scorecard which includes 12 factors. In summary, the project rates below-average under Vitalik Buterin’s Blockchain Trilemma (e.g., Decentralization, Scaleability, Security) as well as User Experience. Vitalik has chosen to focus on Security rather than Scaleability and Decentralization. That being said, management and the Ethereum Foundation are working on alleviating its shortcomings. Ethereum’s roadmap can be found here . Ethereum rates well for Ecosystem Development, Funding, Developers, (new) Management team, Roadmap, Use-Case, Tokenomics and Social Engagement. Ethereum also benefits from Lindy’s Law as it’s been around for a decade and has been copied, forked and battle-tested. Ethereum’s been said to work in an “Ivory Tower” away from the real world as Vitalik philosophizes about blockchain. Developers of Dapps have complained that Ethereum doesn’t reach out to them or “return phone calls” all of which sapped the excitement out of the chain in favor of sexier projects such as Solana ( SOL-USD ). Again, Ethereum’s steady, slow and corporate while Solana is entrepreneurial. Prophetizing Ethereum ETH’s having its most dramatic shift in history as skeptics jump onto the bull bandwagon. Despite being a long-term ETH bull, I have been fairly critical of them on social media (see below). I think their largest mistake was not shifting the narrative to “ETH as store of value” as they executed the “Dencun” and “Pectra” upgrades – both of which significantly reduced the amount of fee-revenues going to the L1. This effectively lowers intrinsic value using the DCF valuation method, making Ethereum appear overvalued relative to its current market cap. Author's creation, LinkedIn The chart below shows how Ethereum’s inflation rate initially declined post-Merge” (move to proof-of-stake) but inevitably rose to 0.8%/year due to its upgrades. Ultrasound Money The Ethereum Foundation’s change in focus has given investors hope. This is best evangelized by Etherealize – their bull case is summarized in the table below. (Note: just to be clear, I don’t “buy” all of their bullish factors – several of which repeat themselves. On the rightmost column, I marked the ones that are uniquely bullish factors to Ethereum as “Yes”, as the others are common in other layer 1 chains.) Author's creation, Etherealize data The Comeback Kid This term refers to someone who bounces back from hardship to achieve success again. The term often highlights resilience and the ability to persevere through challenging circumstances. Ok, maybe I’m stretching this a little bit, but in some ways Ethereum is the comeback kid. Yes, it didn’t go through a near-death experience like Solana, but Ethereum had a turnaround nonetheless. Recent changes in leadership at the Ethereum Foundation and a strategic focus on the layer 1’s scalability and U/X should result in a new lease on life. If you recall, Ethereum gave up on internal sharding and instead moved to dozens of L2s – all of which have different U/X’s. The Pectra upgrade resolves this issue via Account Abstraction ( EIP-7702) that: Improves U/X and user-experience Simplifies the development of Dapps And enhances security by providing multi-factor and other recovery options Recently Coinbase’s ( COIN ) Base-chain introduced a rebranded Base App that is a super-App platform (apps, one-tap payments, trading, social-media…) that “abstracts-away” all the friction points that have been hindering non-tech users from joining Web3. Ether as Digital Oil I would like to expand on factors from the above table that are mostly unique to Ethereum. Qualitatively, I believe Ethereum will be successful as cryptocurrency deregulation pivots the market to professional money managers and institutions such as banks. There are three bills which favor Ethereum: the Genius Bill (signed by Trump) for stablecoins, the Anti-CBDC Act and the CLARITY ACT. I expect the latter two will be signed into law by year-end. Institutions favor Ethereum for many reasons, some of which mirror themselves, meaning they’re comfortable working with technologies that are well-established and battle-tested. Asset managers also like the fact that Ethereum pays “dividends” in the form of staking returns (~ 3% yield ). Since Ether is a store of value and battle-tested, institutions prefer tokenizing assets on its platform without worrying if it’ll be around years from now or whether it’ll have high inflation. One concrete example showing that institutions are indeed interested in Ethereum is the volume of ETH CFDs. These are institutional derivative contracts for the difference between the opening and closing price of ETH. ETH’s market share of volume surged from 6.6% in FY’24 to 13.6% as of 1H’25. Wintermute About 55% of all tokenized assets (includes Stablecoins) are on Ethereum and this will rise quickly now that Genius has been signed into law. Further, if you include the Ethereum ecosystem (L2s, rollups) that percentage rises to over 75% (league table below). RWA.xyz ETH as a Strategic Reserve Asset Now that I’ve presented all the attributes that make Ethereum (the blockchain network) and ETH the native currency so revered to institutions, it makes sense that they would want to stockpile it into a treasury reserve as has been done with Bitcoin. Sharplink’s ( SBET ) Joe Lubin is to ETH in what MicroStrategy’s ( MSTR ) Michael Saylor is to BTC. You can think of ETH treasuries as Bitcoin with extra bells & whistles as the treasuries will be gathering Defi returns. The table below shows the largest treasuries and The Ether Machine recently joined with a stated goal of having $1.5Bn in ETH. Strategic.ETH.Reserve.xyz Some asset managers (especially smaller managers) have chosen to participate in ETH “ownership” by purchasing spot ETFs that custody Ether. The recent trend in ETF flows towards Ethereum rather than Bitcoin is the largest I’ve seen since ETH ETFs were first approved last year. In the table below, notice the percentage of Ethereum flows has sharply increased this year. For example, they rose from 38% of Bitcoin’s flow YTD to 89% MTD. CoinShares Is ETH’s 60% bull run a harbinger of Altcoin Season ? I believe the recent runup in ETH’s price is Ethereum normalizing back to its place as digital Silver as Bitcoin is to Gold. In my previous articles over the last year, I stated that we probably won’t have Altcoin Season until at least May’25 and by “By George” that’s exactly when ETH started mooning. However, the reasons why I said “wait till May” was that I assumed that a) the U.S. and or global economies would slow and b) that the Fed would begin Quantitative Easing and this will show itself by accelerating M2 growth (chart below). Neither has happened, albeit M2 growth has risen from 6% during my last article to 8% (tipping point ?). The U.S. Unemployment Rate remains at a low 4.1% (June 2025) despite “soft data” remaining lackluster. Consequently, I think Altcoins are Oscillators at best, but more likely they’re Call Options that steadily decline towards zero. Remember, low entry-barriers have allowed for the number of created cryptocurrencies to rise from 20,000 (previous Altcoin Season) to a whopping 18.88 million. That’s a lot of supply ! CoinMarketCap BGeometrics Speculation is getting Rampant My proprietary Indicators of Risk within financial markets show we’re near a local top and near peak speculation (though not as high as 2021). I am seeing confluence with other markets including crypto. As you can see in the charts below, crypto is also near peak speculation. The charts show just how excessive this speculation is. The first chart shows that Perpetual Futures Premiums on Altcoins are quite high (meaning there’s high demand for leveraged long exposure ) and tend to peak near local tops. The second chart shows that Whales holding Bitcoin are transferring coins to exchanges, which is typically done when they’re preparing to sell them. (Remember: Altcoins are tied to the hip of Bitcoin.) GlassNode GlassNode So then why am so Bullish on ETH ? I think ETH and especially Altcoins, could have a correction during the near-term as we wait for the Fed to add liquidity. However, I remain bullish (Rated “ Strong Buy ”) for my 10 year time horizon. There’s considerable resistance at the $4000-plus level on the chart, and according to Glassnode, it’ll be excessively difficult getting past $4,500, as this level represents one standard deviation of Ethereum’s active realized price. I leave you with a quote from Kevin Li (@ Artemis): “ETH isn’t just like a Cloud software company or a simple Utility token for transaction fees. Rather, it represents a scarce, programmable, and economically essential reserve asset—one that underpins the security, settlement, and functionality of a progressively institutionalized on-chain financial ecosystem.” GlassNode",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4805359-ethereums-success-wont-translate-into-altcoins?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"ETH|ALTCOIN|TRADING|BTC|MARKET","FETH|ETHA|ETH-USD",cryptocompare

Meanwhile, ETH was predicted to have lower short-term volatility earlier this month, but this has since reversed,” Dawson writes. Source: Derive.xyz, Amberdata BTC’s 30-day ATM volatility has dropped to its lowest level in two weeks, now sitting at 36%, down from a peak of 40%. “BTC’s 30-day ATM volatility has dropped to its lowest level in the last fortnight, now sitting at 36%, down from a peak of 40%,” he says. Additionally, BTC’s chances of reaching $150,000 by August have stagnated over the past week, currently standing just below 20%. But the chances of ETH hitting $4,500 by 29 August jumped to 45% from 5% at the start of July. “Since May, ETH has been on an absolute tear relative to BTC. The ETH/BTC ratio has almost doubled from 0.018 BTC per ETH to 0.0325,” Dawson says. “The rise of ETH treasury companies like Bitmine and Ethermachine signals growing institutional alignment and could mark the start of a new alt season heading into Q3 2025.” Furthermore, blockchain data platform Glassnode found on Monday that BTC’s $117,000 level was still attracting demand. “The $110,000–$117,000 range is gradually filling in. BTC is being accumulated on both sides – buyers stepping in on dips, while earlier buyers are now acquiring at higher levels,” they also wrote . $BTC options skew shows an unusual divergence: 1M puts trade at a premium (+4.6%), while 1W skew lags. This suggests near-term bullish sentiment, with traders using 1W calls, while 1M downside protection signals hedging or profit-taking on the rally. pic.twitter.com/QwJyWSdWXm — glassnode (@glassnode) July 28, 2025 Meanwhile, Tom Bruni, VP of Community and Editor-in-Chief at Stocktwits , commented that “the market’s been flashing signs of overheating, with meme stocks and altcoins taking the spotlight.” However, “despite all the noise,” Bruni says, major indexes barely moved, while international stocks remained range-bound. If risk assets, including Bitcoin, drop even after “positive” tariff news, “that could be a warning sign that this run is losing steam.” XRP is Regaining Momentum Moreover, James Toledano, Chief Operating Officer at Unity Wallet , commented on XRP’s recent price performance. “The waters are a little choppy where XRP is concerned because the price is low compared to Bitcoin, so the price swings, although seemingly small, are big in percentage terms.” The price is down 9% in a week, and it’s up 44% in a month and 420% in a year. Despite the weekly drop, “the general feeling is optimistic,” Toledano says. The coin is regaining momentum as exchange-traded fund (ETF) optimism and legal clarity “converge, pushing it briefly above $3.6 before correcting.” Futures products like ProShares’ UXRP are “fueling speculation about a potential spot ETF becoming a reality.” Also, XRP saw stronger institutional confidence since Ripple’s “partial legal win” in March With the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) “maintaining a softened posture, many see a structural step forward for XRP’s legitimacy in U.S. markets,” Toledano writes. “Despite recent volatility and $105 million in liquidations, improving liquidity, growing institutional flows, and ETF-driven optimism are aligning, making a continued rally plausible if inflows and optimism continue to converge.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $118,976. Despite the minor drop today, the price recuperated quickly from the intraday low of $117,948. It peaked at $119,468 and has continued trading between $117,000 $119,000. These are strong indications of what to observe: whether the price will be pushed below the $117,000 level, in which case it may return to $115,000, possibly lower. On the other hand, climbing above $119,000 could lead to $122,000, and subsequently a new ATH. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView Moreover, Ethereum is currently trading at $3,886. This is a decrease from the daily high of $3,919. Nonetheless, the price is evidently moving to the much-anticipated $4,000 mark. Many analysts argue that it’s bound to hit it very soon. How long it will hold it is another story. Furthermore, the crypto market sentiment has dropped towards the neutral zone, nearly entering it.

Quick FAQ Why did crypto move against stocks today? The crypto market decreased over the last 24 hours, and the stock market closed with a mixed performance on Monday. For example, the S&P 500 was up by 0.018%, the Nasdaq-100 increased by 0.36%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.14%. The stock market is awaiting a flurry of news related to trade deals, tech company earnings reports, and several key economic data and decisions. Is this dip sustainable? This is likely a typical market pullback, and the prices will still go up. That said, incoming news from the US, including trade deals, tariffs, inflation, and the interest rate, will affect the market. It remains to be seen in what way.
