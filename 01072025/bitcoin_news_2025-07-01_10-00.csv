2025-07-01T07:54:47,"Crypto lost to hacks and scams in H1 2025 tops 2024 total at $2.5B: CertiK","Nearly $2.5 billion worth of cryptocurrencies were stolen across 290 incidents in the first half of 2025, surpassing total losses recorded in 2024. According to CertiK’s latest Hack3d report shared with crypto.news, compromised wallets accounted for the largest share of losses, totalling over $1.7 billion across 34 incidents. Phishing attacks followed, siphoning more than $410 million in 132 cases, while code vulnerabilities led to losses exceeding $283 million across 114 incidents. Exit scams and price manipulation were less frequent during this period but were still notable, resulting in combined losses of nearly $20 million. Access control exploits accounted for $42 million in damages. Notably, total losses in the first six months of 2025 have already surpassed the $2.42 billion recorded for all of 2024. After adjusting for returned and frozen funds, net losses stand at $2.29 billion, exceeding last year’s adjusted total of $1.98 billion. A significant portion of this year’s losses, roughly 72%, or $1.78 billion, stemmed from two large-scale incidents, the Bybit hack in Q1 and the Cetus protocol exploit in Q2. Excluding these, H1 losses would have stood at around $690 million.

While the pace of attacks slowed significantly in the second quarter, several major incidents still contributed to substantial losses. Phishing was the most widespread attack vector in Q2, accounting for over $395 million in losses across 52 incidents. Code vulnerabilities and access control weaknesses followed, resulting in losses of $235.7 million and $36.1 million, respectively. Wallet compromises, which had dominated Q1, caused $112 million in losses from 9 incidents in Q2. While the Bybit breach remained the most damaging incident of the year, Q2 saw several other high-value breaches involving protocol exploits and infrastructure compromises. These included the $225.6 million exploit of Cetus, the $89.1 million hack of Iran’s Nobitex exchange, and a $16.1 million attack on ALEX Lab. Other incidents involving Bitopro, Cork Protocol , KiloEx , and zkSync-based projects were primarily the result of smart contract flaws, infrastructure breaches, or compromised wallets. Ethereum was the most targeted blockchain, suffering losses of more than $1.58 billion across 164 incidents, while Bitcoin came in second, with over $373 million lost across 10 incidents. CertiK noted that $187 million in stolen funds were returned in the first half of the year, bringing the adjusted total losses to just over $2.28 billion. Of this, $180 million was recovered in Q2 alone. As previously reported by crypto.news, a separate mid-year analysis by blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs estimated $2.1 billion in crypto losses across 75 incidents during the same period, with the majority linked to infrastructure-level breaches such as private key thefts and front-end hijacks.

2025-07-01T07:35:07,"Is the Bitcoin Uptrend Over? Analysts See Momentum Waning After 3-Month Surge","The Bitcoin rally, which has lifted prices more than 40% since early April, may be running out of steam as analysts flag weakening momentum and rising profit-taking. Key Takeaways: Bitcoin’s rally momentum is fading as traders who bought below $80,000 take profits. Analysts say Bitcoin’s next move will depend on macro factors like Fed rate decisions. Despite short-term uncertainty, key support levels remain strong, and some experts see potential for a breakout. Bitfinex market strategists said Monday that for the first time during the recent uptrend, “momentum has begun to fade,” citing cooling spot volumes and a slowdown in taker buy pressure. The price of Bitcoin rose from $73,273 on April 9 to $107,380 at publication, but signs now point to possible consolidation or a local top rather than continued explosive gains. Profit-Taking Heats Up as Sub-$80K Bitcoin Buyers Cash Out Traders taking profits, particularly those who bought under $80,000, have intensified selling pressure, according to the analysts. They noted that Bitcoin’s next significant move hinges on macroeconomic drivers and institutional appetite, especially inflows into US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs. These ETFs have attracted net inflows of $4.63 billion over 14 straight trading sessions since June 9, with economist Timothy Peterson calling last week’s $2.2 billion in inflows “massive” and projecting a 70% chance of continued positive flows this week. Bitcoin consolidates between $100K–$110K, with dip buyers defending $98.7K and leverage low. History suggests what’s coming next: Q3 is typically BTC’s weakest quarter, with low volatility and slower moving markets. Will this time be different? https://t.co/pmYnTBWkcY pic.twitter.com/XDaqlp6zci — Bitfinex (@bitfinex) June 30, 2025 Attention is also turning to the Federal Reserve’s July 30 meeting, where markets currently assign a 19% chance of an interest rate cut, based on CME FedWatch data. Lower rates tend to be bullish for risk assets like Bitcoin, adding further weight to the Fed’s decision for short-term price direction. Despite near-term caution, analysts stressed that Bitcoin’s higher time frame structure remains intact, with key support levels holding firm. Meanwhile, some remain optimistic. For one, economist Donald Dean suggested Bitcoin is primed for a breakout following tight consolidation near recent highs. $BTCUSD $BTC Bitcoin – Getting Ready to Move Price Target: $130,981 Bitcoin is getting ready to move higher with tight consolidation at the volume shelf.

Bitcoin Adoption as Treasury Asset Finds Momentum As reported, over the past week, at least nine UK firms, from web design startups to mining businesses, have announced plans to buy Bitcoin or revealed recent purchases to add the cryptocurrency to their corporate treasuries. Among the UK firms, AI services provider Tao Alpha disclosed plans to raise £100 million after revealing a bitcoin treasury plan that triggered investor interest. Smarter Web Company, a small website design firm, saw its market value rocket from £4 million to over £1 billion in just two months after announcing its Bitcoin purchases in April, although shares have since cooled. In the US, Anthony Pompliano’s ProCap BTC acquired 3,724 Bitcoin for $386 million as part of plans to go public through an SPAC merger, while Japan’s Metaplanet raised $517.8 million on the first day of its ambitious “555 Million Plan,” which targets 210,000 Bitcoin by 2027.

2025-07-01T07:31:20,"Bitcoin Claims 83% of Weekly Crypto Inflows As Digital Asset Funds Extend Positive Streak to 11 Weeks","Digital asset funds experienced inflows of $2.7 billion last week, their 11th consecutive week of gains. This figure pushed the total to $16.9 billion. Interestingly, the mid-year momentum is similar to 2024, when inflows reached $18.3 billion by June’s end. CoinShares noted that continued investor interest is likely tied to a mix of increased geopolitical tensions and the current “uncertainty” around monetary policy, both of which are driving demand for digital assets. Bitcoin Dominates Digital Asset Inflows According to the latest edition of the ‘Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report ,’ Bitcoin captured 83% of total inflows in digital asset investment products last week, as it pulled in $2.2 billion amidst strong investor optimism. Short-Bitcoin products continued to see outflows, with $2.9 million exiting last week, which pushed year-to-date outflows to $12 million. This essentially indicated a positive sentiment around Bitcoin. Ethereum followed suit with $429 million in weekly inflows, as it catapulted its year-to-date total to $2.9 billion, owing to the ongoing bullish investor interest. XRP also secured $10.6 million last week, bringing its yearly inflows to $219 million. While Solana recorded $5.3 million in weekly inflows, its year-to-date tally remains at $91 million. Next up was Sui, which attracted $1.4 million in inflows last week, reaching $4.7 million so far this year. Chainlink and Cardano saw weekly minor inflows of $0.8 million and $0.7 million, respectively, which pushed their year-to-date totals to $24 million and $10 million. Multi-asset products added a modest $0.2 million last week, totaling $58 million in inflows for the year, while Litecoin’s YTD inflows stand at $5 million. Inflows last week were largely driven by the US, which recorded $2.65 billion, while Switzerland and Germany saw smaller inflows of $23 million and $19.8 million. Australia added $8.7 million. In contrast, Sweden saw outflows of $15.9 million, while Canada, Brazil, and Hong Kong recorded outflows of $13.6 million, $2.4 million, and $2.3 million, respectively. Following price rallies, Hong Kong has continued to experience outflows, which reached $132 million for June. Bitcoin Defies June Lull Bitcoin defied its usual June weakness with a last-minute rally, as it caught up to equities after Trump’s $4.5 trillion tax bill advanced in the Senate. According to QCP Capital’s note , the focus has now shifted to today’s vote, aiming for a July 4 deadline. On the institutional side of things, demand remains strong, with spot BTC ETFs seeing $2.2 billion in inflows. Strategy and Metaplanet continued steady accumulation, while leveraged longs increased as the leading crypto approached $108K. Ethereum and Solana rallied on optimism over potential ETH and SOL staking ETFs. However, options markets remain muted, risk reversals also appear to be flat, and implied volatility is near historical lows despite the bullish spot price action.

July 1, 2025 • 07:15 UTC DEXs have recorded $385B in spot trades in June, according to data collected by The Block , despite DEX’s 30-day trading volume being down by 12% in June compared to May. The difference is that CEX spot trades are down 30% during the same period, making it the lowest monthly trade volume since September 2024. These numbers are important because the disparity between DEXs and CEXs never fell below 12% in 2025 and only went under four times during a 5-year span, between 2019 and 2024. The reason behind the observation, according to analyst Ignas , is that traders appear to use DEXs for price discovery movements, but use CEXs for exit liquidity. This trend can have a potentially negative impact on fund security, given that DEXs are rather suboptimal in this category, compared to non-custodial wallets. Products like Best Wallet, for instance, are non-custodial, require no KYC, and are free to use, making them superior in terms of overall security and ease of use. Best of all, the Best Wallet Token ($BEST) presale improves on the best aspects of this wallet (trading fees, staking, and community governance). Learn more about Best Wallet Token here.

2025-07-01T07:15:42,"Financial Advisor Edelman predicts that Bitcoin could hit $500,000 with TradFi involvement.","Ric Edelman, the founder of Edelman Financial Engines, has called on investors to allocate between 40% and 10% of their portfolio to crypto. The prominent financial advisor shared the take in a recent whitepaper for the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals ( DACFP). According to Edelman , who is also DACFP’s founder, the traditional investment model of 60/40 allocation to stock and bond is no longer useful. He attributed this to the massive technological advancements that have led to high longevity rates. Instead, he recommended that investors put their money in crypto while outlining the percentage to allocate based on their risk profiles. In Edelman’s opinion, aggressive investors should have 40% of their crypto investments, while conservative ones should have 10%. He said: “Conservative investors should now have a 10% crypto allocation. Moderate clients should place 25% of their portfolios in crypto, and aggressive clients should allocate 40% of their investments to crypto.” Interestingly, the veteran investor with 39 years of experience in the financial sector noted that investing in crypto is no longer a speculative trade. According to him, a passive market-weighted index of all asset classes would have 3% allocated to crypto, showing just how big the sector has become. Thus, anyone choosing to ignore the crypto sector is simply shorting it. Edelman bullish on crypto, says Bitcoin could reach $500,000 Meanwhile, Edelman made a bullish case for investors to allocate up to 40% of their portfolio to crypto. According to him, there is no reason anyone would choose to ignore an asset class that has outperformed the rest of the market for 15 consecutive years. In backing up his claim, he highlighted high-performing crypto assets and sectors, including the stablecoin sector. He noted that Tether’s massive $13 billion profits last year exceeded what several major US companies, including McDonald’s, BlackRock, IBM, and Ford, pulled in. Edelman’s summary of why everyone should invest in crypto (Source: DACFP) Beyond that, Edelman believes President Donald Trump’s win in 2024 has also set the stage for crypto’s good fortunes. According to him, the pro-crypto moves from the Trump administration and policy reversal from individuals and institutions are all signs that crypto is now a derisked investment. Unsurprisingly, the prominent financial advisor is particularly bullish on Bitcoin and has predicted it could be worth $500,000, noting that this is based on demand and supply. He noted that institutions’ massive accumulation of assets will continue to drive up their prices. He said: “There’s $750 trillion in global assets (stocks, bonds, real estate, gold, cash and collectibles). A mere 1% allocation would cause $7.5 trillion to flow into Bitcoin. That’s $377,000 per bitcoin. Add that to Bitcoin’s current price, and you get to about $500,000 per Bitcoin. It’s simple arithmetic.” Interestingly, Edelman highlighted how investors can get crypto exposure, from direct acquisition to equity proxies. His whitepaper also advises financial advisors to allocate part of their portfolio to crypto by including responses to clients’ common objections and criticizing advisors who do not recommend crypto to their customers. Reactions trail Edelman’s endorsement of crypto allocation Meanwhile, the whitepaper from Edelman has sparked a mixed but mostly positive reaction from experts. Bloomberg senior analyst Eric Balchunas described it as the biggest endorsement of crypto from TradFi since BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. According to him, this is because of Edelman’s status in the financial advisory community, where he is one of the most influential voices. He said: “This guy is Mr RIA. Manages $300b for 1.3 million clients. Tops the Barron’s list of America Advisors regularly.” Meanwhile, some in the crypto community believe that Edelman should have specified BTC as the asset to invest in rather than simply saying crypto. Balchunas noted that this should not be a cause for debate, as almost all investors, including Edelman, acknowledge that Bitcoin is the primary investment asset in the crypto sector. Interestingly, Bitwise European head of research André Dragosh does not agree that technological advancements killed the 60/40 model. Instead, he attributes it to rising inflation, noting that stocks and bonds underperform once inflation rises above 5%. However, he also recommended diversifying into hard assets such as Gold and Bitcoin. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

He added that owning crypto is no longer a speculative position, but “failing to do so is.” The founder of the $300 billion investment advisory firm, Edelman Financial Engines, made the dramatic recommendation suggesting that aggressive investors should hold up to 40% of their assets in crypto, 25% for moderate, while conservative investors should allocate 10%. You need to plan on living past 100, and that means you need more than stocks and bonds. My new white paper explains why you’ll get to 100+ and why your portfolio should include 10% to 40% crypto.

Institutions Driving Markets Edelman’s recommendation comes as institutional adoption accelerates, with over $20 billion invested in spot Bitcoin ETFs by wealthy investors and institutions, and more than 70 crypto ETF proposals pending with the SEC. The finance guru also cited the Trump administration’s regulatory reversal, the growth of stablecoins, and basic supply-demand dynamics supporting his bullish outlook, even suggesting Bitcoin could reach $500,000. Institutional investors and corporations have been scooping up all of the Bitcoin that long-term holders have been selling, which is why prices have stagnated recently. However, “Bitcoin’s price appreciation isn’t speculation — it’s just supply and demand,” concluded Edelman.

2025-07-01T07:08:45,"FTX Reveals Next Repayment Date to Fully Compensate Large Creditors","FTX creditor representative Sunil Kavuri has provided a new update on the next distribution of claim payments to creditors of the defunct crypto exchange. Recall that FTX commenced the distribution of funds to eligible users on February 18, 2025, starting with small creditors with claims under $50,000. According to Kavuri, FTX paid creditors in this category (those entitled to claims under $50,000) 120% of their initial claim value. This indicates that creditors received a 20% premium on their original claim value. Afterward, FTX commenced the second round of repayments on May 30, 2025, distributing $5 billion to creditors with claims over $50,000. The exchange distributed the funds within three business days of May 30. However, creditors with claims exceeding $50,000 received only 72.5% of their initial claim value. Next Payment Schedule Notably, Kavuri has disclosed the next repayment date for the remaining 27.5% of claims to large creditors. According to him, the upcoming distribution is expected to take place in Q4 2025, specifically from October to December. Additionally, he suggested that the repayment schedule could be extended to 2026 or 2027. This repayment will ensure that creditors with claims exceeding $50,000 receive 100% of their claim. Besides the claim value, these large creditors are also entitled to post-petition interest, which totals 40% to 80%. https://twitter.com/sunil_trades/status/1939692898154369096FTX's Epic Collapse and Repayment EffortsThis ongoing repayment schedule comes more than two years after FTX's collapse in November 2022. The exchange declared bankruptcy, with key executives sentenced to several years in prison. Specifically, a federal court in New York sentenced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) to 25 years in prison due to his role in mismanaging users' funds, leading to the exchange’s downfall. The court subsequently sentenced other executives, including Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison and FTX Digital Markets CEO Ryan Salame, to two and seven-and-a-half-year jail terms, respectively. Since the epic failure of FTX, the exchange has been working to reimburse users, with repayments commencing earlier this year. Despite FTX’s efforts, many have criticized the disbursement process for valuing users’ claims at token prices as of the time of the bankruptcy filing in late 2022. It is worth noting that crypto prices have soared significantly ever since. For instance, Bitcoin, which traded around $20,000 in late 2022, has rallied more than 400% to over $100,000.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/07/01/ftx-reveals-next-repayment-date-to-fully-compensate-large-creditors/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ftx-reveals-next-repayment-date-to-fully-compensate-large-creditors,"EXCHANGE|MARKET|BTC|BUSINESS|RESEARCH","Market|Latest Crypto Exchanges News|Latest FTX News Market Updates",cryptocompare
2025-07-01T07:04:10,"Lawsuit Alleges Citibank Ignored Red Flags, Aided Scammers in $20,000,000 Pig Butchering Romance Scam","A Texas man is suing the financial giant Citibank for allegedly enabling scammers in a $20 million pig butchering scheme. Pig butchering scams typically involve scammers gaining the trust of victims over time to convince them to invest digital assets or cash into fraudulent websites that they control. Michael B. Zidell says in newly filed court documents that he was contacted on Facebook in early 2023 by someone claiming to be a California business owner named Carolyn Parker. Zidell says he perceived a romantic relationship developing with Parker, who told him that she had invested in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on a website called “OpenrarityPro.com” and made millions of dollars in investment gains. Zidell sent 43 wire transfers totalling $20 million to different accounts to “make a market” for NFTs on OpenarirtyPro.com as Parker had instructed. Of those, 12 transfers worth nearly $4 million were sent to one Citibank account called Guju, Inc. A month or so after Zidell started investing, OpenrarityPro.com displayed his account as being worth more than $300 million, but when he tried to withdraw some of the funds, he was told he’d have to send more money to cover a “risk deposit,” according to the court documents. In late April, the OpenrarityPro.com website disappeared, and Zidell began to suspect he was the victim of fraud. Zidell’s lawyers argue in the court documents that Citibank didn’t exercise thorough due diligence on the Guju account. “In the account opening documents for Defendant Citibank’s accounts for Guju, Inc., their customer states that it will receive no wire transfers, and the total value of the wires it would out would be less than $250,000 per month. In fact, the wires they say they will send are $8,000 transfers to China. The reality was obviously different.

2025-07-01T07:00:18,"Solana Summer Loading? SOL Eyes $180 Following Staked ETF-Fueled Breakout","Solana (SOL) has retested a crucial resistance level after recovering the $150 level over the weekend. The surge, fueled by the upcoming launch of a SOL-based staked exchange-traded fund (ETF), has led some analysts to forecast a rally toward the next key target. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price At $145,000 In September? Bullish Dojis Suggest Upward Move Solana Staked ETFs Coming On Wednesday On Monday, Solana’s price soared to a key resistance level following the introduction of “the first-ever Solana staked crypto ETF in the US.” Rex Shares announced it will launch a Solana-based staked ETF this Wednesday, aiming to offer exposure to SOL and staking rewards. According to the X post, the REX-Osprey ETF will track SOL’s performance while “generating yield through on-chain staking,” starting a “new era of yield-generating crypto exposure.” As a result, Solana climbed to the $160 barrier, which led to nearly $9 million in short positions liquidated on Monday afternoon. Market Watcher Daan Crypto Trades considers Solana “bounced nicely over the weekend” but has yet to turn the Low Timeframe (LTF) trend around. He explained that reclaiming the $159-$167 area is necessary to aim for higher levels. Additionally, the Daily 200-day Moving Average (MA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) are currently located within this range. “I would want to see price trade back above that to start targeting the $180-$200 region again,” he detailed. Nonetheless, the trader questioned whether a Solana spot ETF-driven rally will fuel the cryptocurrency’s run. Notably, multiple investment firms, including Grayscale, VanEck, 21Shares, and Bitwise, have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a spot SOL ETF in the US. According to recent reports, the investment products have a “high likelihood” of being approved in the coming weeks, which has seemingly fueled investors’ expectations of a bullish “Solana Summer.” “The big question is how much demand there will be,” Daan asserted, noting that Ethereum (ETH) sport ETFs, approved in July 2024, had a disappointing launch and “only started seeing decent inflows about a year later.” SOL Ready For Another Breakout? Following the ETF-fueled breakout, analyst Hardy noted Solana’s “Textbook move, clean breakout, clean retest, and pump,” which could trigger a run toward the $200 barrier. Notably, the cryptocurrency saw a remarkable performance over the weekend, reclaiming the $144-$148 crucial area and breaking past the $150 mark. Amid this performance, the analyst highlighted that Solana had broken out of its local downtrend line after reclaiming the $148 resistance and was retesting the breakout zone. He explained that there is “Juicy liquidity sitting above, ready to be taken,” adding that Solana needed to hold the $150 support to continue its bullish run toward the next target. Related Reading: Analyst Reveals Rational Behind XRP Price Reaching $9.5 And $37.5 Meanwhile, analyst Crypto Batman considers that Solana is “setting up very nicely” after the $160 retest. Per the post, “It has broken out from a bullish flag pattern that bottomed at the 0.618 Fibonacci level, a clear sign of impulsive strength in the trend.” It’s worth noting that SOL has been trading within the bullish formation since the May breakout, hovering between the $130 and $180 range for nearly two months. The analyst forecasted that a quick retest to close the bullish Fair Value Gap (FVG) and the pattern’s upper boundary, around the $148 area, “could set the stage for the next leg.” As of this writing, Solana is trading at $155, a 2% increase in the daily timeframe.

The Fineqia Bitcoin Yield ETP (YBTC), listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange, targets a 6% annual yield by deploying investor capital into DeFi strategies. It is issued by Fineqia’s Liechtenstein-based subsidiary and advised by Psalion Yield, a digital asset investment firm focused on blockchain-based yield. Unlike existing crypto yield ETPs that rely on derivatives or structured notes, YBTC maintains one-to-one exposure to bitcoin while generating returns directly from DeFi protocols. “It allows investors to earn more BTC while they hold it, combining long-term conviction with compounding returns, all inside a regulated wrapper,” said Fineqia CEO, Bundeep Singh Rangar. The ETP also supports in-kind transfers, meaning that digital asset holders can contribute BTC directly to the product without the need to first convert into cash incurring a taxable event. YBTC arrives at a time when investor interest in crypto-focused investments is growing. These investment products has brought digital assets closer to traditional investors, allowing them to invest in digital assets in a familiar way through brokerage accounts without the need of crypto wallets and blockchain transactions. Bitcoin exchange-traded products enjoyed rapid growth over the past year and have gobbled up $150 billion of assets, Fineqia said.

2025-07-01T06:42:07,"Senator Lummis pushes for crypto-friendly amendments in Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill","U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis wants to add a crypto tax amendment to President Donald Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill to exclude small transactions from capital gains and resolve double taxation for miners and stakers. On June 30, Lummis announced her push to insert language into the sweeping budget reconciliation bill that would overhaul how digital asset activity is taxed. “It’s time to stop this unfair tax treatment and ensure America is the world’s Bitcoin and Crypto Superpower,” Lummis wrote on X. Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill , a more than 1,000-page reconciliation package central to President Trump’s economic agenda, includes sweeping fiscal and regulatory measures and has become a high-stakes priority for Republican lawmakers ahead of a self-imposed Friday deadline. The proposed amendment includes a de minimis exemption for crypto transactions under $300 and changes to how staking and mining rewards are taxed, aligning them with the point of sale rather than the time of receipt. In documents shared with crypto media, Lummis’ office outlined key elements of the proposal, including a $300 threshold on individual transactions and a $5,000 annual cap on total tax-free activity. It also aims to eliminate what industry advocates describe as “double taxation,” where digital asset holders are taxed both when they receive staking or mining rewards and again when they sell those assets. You might also like: Trump-linked American Bitcoin raises $220M to purchase Bitcoin and mining rigs Further, the amendment includes language addressing tax treatment for crypto lending, wash sales, and charitable contributions. The goal, according to Lummis and industry backers, is to remove outdated tax barriers that have discouraged everyday use and long-term holding of digital assets. Crypto advocacy groups, including the Bitcoin Policy Institute and the Solana Policy Institute, along with prominent industry figures such as Michael Saylor, have publicly endorsed the amendment. (See below.) We must end unfair taxes on BTC miners if America is going to be the world's Bitcoin Superpower. https://t.co/3DeRFx558v — Michael Saylor (@saylor) June 30, 2025 Matthew Pines, executive director at the Bitcoin Policy Institute, urged constituents to contact Senate Finance Committee Republicans to support the measure. He noted that a de minimis exemption would “reduce [the] burden, promoting fair compliance and everyday adoption.” Similarly, Kristin Smith, president of the Solana Policy Institute, said the amendment could “unlock domestic growth and create jobs” by clarifying staking tax policy. For crypto advocates at The Digital Chamber, the proposal is a “long overdue fix” to what the group described as a misalignment between tax policy and economic reality. “Today, staking and block rewards are taxed upon both acquisition and point of sale. Senator Lummis’ provision solves this by taxing rewards only when sold,” the group wrote in a call-to-action message Still, it remains uncertain whether the crypto-focused amendment will be adopted. The Senate is set to vote on numerous proposed changes to the reconciliation bill throughout the week. Trump has reportedly pressed lawmakers to pass the final version by July 5. Even if adopted in the Senate, the bill would still require approval in the House before reaching the president’s desk. Last year, lawmakers Wiley Nickel and Drew Ferguson introduced a similar measure targeting the taxation framework for cryptocurrency staking rewards, but it failed to advance through the House Ways and Means Committee.

2025-07-01T06:40:10,"Arkham: Satoshi Nakamoto address receives $20k from mystery wallet","Arkham’s on-chain monitoring detected a suspected transfer of $20,000 in BTC to Satoshi Nakamoto’s address. This is the latest transfer made to Satoshi in the past four months. According to on-chain data from Arkham Intelligence, an unknown address sent 0.185 BTC (or around $20,000 at the time of transfer) to an address believed to be owned by the Bitcoin ( BTC ) founder. The transfer was conducted late on June 30. At press time, the wallet linked to Satoshi has $117 billion in holdings, all of which are stored in Bitcoin. Arkham’s official X account suspected that the transfer could have been either an accident or a withdrawal made from an exchange or other crypto-related service. However, it stated it could also be a generous show of gratitude from “an OG Bitcoiner giving back.” It is worth noting that this is the second largest transfer made to the Satoshi Nakamoto address since a Binance user’s account made a $200,000 Bitcoin transfer to the address back in February 2025. Though, it remains unclear whether the transfer was an accident on the exchange’s part or a spontaneous act of gratitude from early Bitcoin users. Satoshi Nakamoto’s address received $20,000 in BTC from an unidentified wallet, July 1, 2025 | Source: Arkham You might also like: CZ speculates Satoshi Nakamoto is an AI from the future At press time, BTC has been seeing moderate drops in the cycle. In the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has gone down 1.26% and is currently trading hands at $106,931. BTC’s market cap continues to stand at $2.12 trillion with a daily trading volume of $22.3 billion. Why is Satoshi Nakamoto’s wallet receiving donations? According to previous data from a CryptoQuant report revealed that miners from the “Satoshi Nakamoto era” only managed to sell 150 BTC in 2025, a significant decrease compared to the staggering 10,000 BTC sold during the same period last year. Not only that, the daily outflow of miners has also fallen from an initial 23,000 BTC in February to only around 6,000 BTC, with the amount of BTC directly transferred to exchanges remaining low. Therefore, it is possible that the transfer was made by a Bitcoin enthusiast to support the Satoshi era miners. At the start of this year, another unidentified wallet was also caught sending $1.19m in Bitcoin to Satoshi Nakamoto’s Genesis address. Similar to the transfer made in February, the sender also used an account on the Binance exchange to send Bitcoin to the first wallet ever made on the network.

Kiyosaki spent over $100,000 today to buy a whole Bitcoin, yet he believes it is a worthwhile investment. He disclosed this in a July 1 tweet , suggesting he would rather take the risk than miss out on buying an asset primed to reach seven figures in the future.I’d Rather Suck Than Be a Loser: Financial AuthorBitcoin continues to trade above $100,000, currently at $106,784, as of the time of writing. Market observers have varying sentiments about this price, with some suggesting it is a premium and others a bargain.Whatever it is, Kiyosaki wants to find out by taking a risk and buying Bitcoin . He emphasized that while he might be wrong about Bitcoin, his wealth of experience has taught him a lot about such investments. According to Kiyosaki, if BTC fails to reach $1 million, he might receive the branding of a sucker.However, he insists he would rather suck than become a loser when he misses Bitcoin’s impending rally to $1 million. This, he believes, is well within Bitcoin’s capabilities. As a result, he projected that the crypto leader would trade at the price mark one day.Meanwhile, from Bitcoin’s current price of $106,784, a rally to $1 million would culminate in a staggering 836% growth. Remarkably, Kiyosaki had earlier predicted that Bitcoin would reach this level by 2030.Nonetheless, he advised due diligence, urging investors to think for themselves rather than make financial decisions based on his “ramblings.” Notwithstanding, his experience and guts tell him Bitcoin could set people on a journey of financial freedom.$1M per BTC a CommonplacePredictions of a Bitcoin surge to $1 million have become a common expectation among enthusiasts.

Kiyosaki stated that Bitcoin's current price level seems “expensive” but that in the future, even today's prices will be considered “cheap”. Kiyosaki admitted that he started investing in Bitcoin late, and stated that he made his first BTC purchase at $6,000. The economist, who said that this price was expensive for him at the time, said that he regrets not buying more Bitcoin at that level today: “I bought my first Bitcoin for $6,000. It was expensive at the time. But now I wish I had bought more.” Related News: Tensions Escalate Between Donald Trump and Fed Chair Jerome Powell - Trump Sends Handwritten Letter - Here Are the Details Reminding that Bitcoin is trading at $107,000 today, Kiyosaki stated that he continues to buy despite this: “Today, my brain says again, ‘this is expensive.’ But I’m buying more. Because if and when Bitcoin reaches $1 million, I’ll say again, ‘I wish I had bought more.’” Giving a message to investors, Kiyosaki argued that those who can only buy one Satoshi (one 100 millionth of Bitcoin) will be happy with their decisions in the future: “Even if you can only afford one Satoshi today, I believe that five years from now you will say, ‘I wish I had bought more.’” Kiyosaki said he didn't know if Bitcoin would ever reach $1 million, but added: “All I know is this: When I look back at the Bitcoin I bought at $107,000, I'll say, 'Buying Bitcoin at that price was priceless.'” *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-01T05:53:04,"Pundit Says Most Money He’ll Ever Make Will Come from Holding XRP to $100+","Crypto founder Edoardo Farina has issued an ambitious outlook regarding his XRP investment, stating that $100 or more in XRP would yield him the most money ever. In a recent post on X, Farina stated that the greatest financial gain he expects to achieve will come from holding XRP until its value surpasses $100.The statement generated attention among XRP holders and critics, given the extreme nature of the outlook. With XRP currently trading around $2, a surge to $100 would represent an increase of over 4,900%.Making Money with XRP at $100+Pundits like Farina often cite this price point as a potential threshold for financial freedom. It forms the basis of his repeated calls for investors to hold at least 10,000 XRP tokens . This amount would place investors in the millionaire class if XRP reaches $100 per coin.Several factors influence this outlook. Some are bullish due to XRP's fundamentals, while others draw confidence from XRP's historical performance.For example, crypto wealth mentor Linda Jones reflected on her early investment, noting that $100 bought 400 XRP at $0.25 each back in January 2021. Today, with XRP trading at $2.18, that same $100 would buy fewer than 50 tokens, highlighting the asset’s significant price growth.Jones believes this trend will continue. Specifically, she predicted that in the future, $100 might buy just one XRP token, implying a price above $100. However, the journey to $100 and the required market cap of approximately $6 trillion leads many to call such ambitions unrealistic. Meanwhile, proponents are drawing inspiration from Bitcoin’s trajectory to support their bullish XRP outlook. Altan Tutar, founder of MoreMarkets, recently sided with XRP enthusiasts on their bold forecasts.Tutar noted that if Bitcoin can reach $100K, then XRP has grounds for similar price performance. While he didn’t explicitly endorse the $10,000 figure, he acknowledged that the XRP community’s belief mirrors the early optimism once held for Bitcoin.More Money from Shorting Bitcoin to $5,000?Meanwhile, proponents like Farina are bullish on XRP at the expense of Bitcoin. He added that his second-largest financial gain will come from shorting Bitcoin below $5,000.He is suggesting that Bitcoin could plummet from its current level of $107,000 to under $5,000. At the same time, he expects XRP to soar to $100.This extreme bearish take on Bitcoin contrasts with the widespread institutional adoption via spot ETFs and increasing demand from sovereign wealth funds.Moreover, XRP is unlikely to soar by 4,900% while Bitcoin drops by 90%, based on historical trends. Bitcoin's ascent has historically benefited altcoins like XRP. A significant dip in BTC would likely drag down the broader crypto market, as has been seen in past cycles.Ultimately, Farina’s perspective suggests a capital rotation from Bitcoin into XRP, fueling XRP’s rise while Bitcoin crashes. However, this remains a highly speculative scenario, especially given Bitcoin's adoption and entrenched market dominance compared to XRP.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/07/01/pundit-says-most-money-hell-ever-make-will-come-from-holding-xrp-to-100/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pundit-says-most-money-hell-ever-make-will-come-from-holding-xrp-to-100,"XRP|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS","Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction",cryptocompare

2025-07-01T05:46:45,"Trump-linked American Bitcoin raises $220M to purchase Bitcoin and mining rigs","Eric Trump-backed cryptocurrency company American Bitcoin has raised $220 million from private investors to purchase Bitcoin and expand its digital mining business. The news was disclosed in a June 30 filing reviewed by Bloomberg, which revealed that part of the equity sale, worth about $10 million, was transacted directly in Bitcoin ( BTC ) rather than U.S. dollars. Through the issuance of additional shares to private investors, American Bitcoin was able to raise $220 million for asset accumulation and mining expansion. The capital raise marks a high-profile entry into the crypto space for the Trump-linked entity and reflects growing institutional confidence in digital asset markets. This comes as political momentum builds in the U.S. for pro -crypto regulation. President Donald Trump continues to promote crypto-friendly policies during his administration. His sons, Eric and Donald Jr., have both been involved in multiple blockchain ventures since their father’s time in office.

As part of its launch, Hut 8 Corp. transferred its mining equipment to the new venture in exchange for an 80% equity stake. Hut 8, which operates mining sites in Alberta, New York, and Texas, plans to take American Bitcoin public via a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining Inc. Bitcoin mining, central to American Bitcoin’s strategy, involves using specialized equipment to verify transactions on the blockchain in exchange for new BTC rewards. The new capital will be used to scale both Bitcoin purchases and infrastructure to support mining activities at a larger scale. Hut 8 has also revealed plans to expand into Dubai. The company has filed paperwork with the Dubai International Financial Centre and is assembling a team there, although it said this move is unrelated to the American Bitcoin project. The capital raise puts American Bitcoin on track to become one of the better-funded mining ventures in the U.S., combining political visibility with an aggressive acquisition strategy. With a public listing in sight, it may soon join the growing number of Bitcoin-focused companies trading on U.S. markets.

2025-07-01T05:45:30,"Kazakhstan Moves to Build State Controlled Crypto Reserve","The initiative is supported by the National Bank of Kazakhstan, and it will be funded by expropriated digital assets and revenue from state-backed crypto mining operations. This move is part of the main goal to establish Kazakhstan as a regional hub, including the recent “CryptoCity” pilot zone launched by President Tokayev. The idea of national crypto reserves is gaining global traction, with Texas and India considering similar strategies. On the corporate side, Michael Saylor’s Strategy expanded its Bitcoin holdings with a $531.9 million purchase, pushing its total to 597,325 BTC and increasing its year-to-date yield to nearly 20%. Meanwhile, BitMine Immersion Technologies raised $250 million to launch an Ethereum treasury, due to ETH’s growing role in stablecoin transactions. This reflects the trend of companies now diversifying into Ethereum. In fact, SharpLink Gaming and Bit Digital also pivoted toward ETH-based strategies to future-proof their digital asset reserves. Kazakhstan Eyes Crypto Reserve Kazakhstan is taking a big step toward integrating cryptocurrency into its national financial framework with plans to establish a state-managed crypto reserve. According to a Monday report from the government-run news agency Kazinform, the National Bank of Kazakhstan is actively studying the development of a crypto reserve, which aligns with international best practices. The proposed reserve will likely be funded through expropriated digital assets and revenue from state-operated crypto mining activities. Kazakhstan central bank’s response to the inquiry National Bank Chairman Timur Suleimenov acknowledged the inherent risks and volatility of cryptocurrencies but believes that centralized oversight will allow for better risk management and regulatory control. A document dated May 22, responding to a parliamentary inquiry, confirmed the central bank’s support for the reserve and suggested it could be managed by a subsidiary specializing in alternative investments. This move is part of Kazakhstan’s embrace of digital assets. In May, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev introduced plans for “CryptoCity,” which is a pilot zone where cryptocurrencies can be used to pay for goods and services. The initiative is part of a larger vision to transform Kazakhstan into a regional crypto hub. Kanysh Tuleushin, the country’s first vice minister of digital development, pointed out that streamlined regulation could make Kazakhstan a leading force in the Central Asian crypto space. However, the government is also increasing its enforcement efforts. Authorities cracked down on 36 illegal crypto exchanges in 2024 to help curb money laundering and improve financial oversight. The idea of state-run crypto reserves is gaining a lot of traction globally. These initiatives typically focus on Bitcoin as the preferred reserve asset. In India, Pradeep Bhandari of the ruling BJP party recently called for a Bitcoin reserve pilot and greater policy clarity. In the United States, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a bill to create the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve , following in the footsteps of the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve concept. Strategy Adds $531M in BTC Meanwhile, Michael Saylor’s Strategy continued to expand its BTC portfolio after buying 4,980 Bitcoin for $531.9 million during the week ending Sunday. According to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company paid an average of $106,801 per coin, as Bitcoin prices surged from around $101,000 on June 23 to above $108,000 by the end of the week. With this latest purchase, Strategy now holds a total of 597,325 BTC, which was acquired for approximately $42.4 billion at an average price of $70,982 per Bitcoin. The company’s year-to-date gain in Bitcoin climbed to 85,871 BTC, equivalent to roughly $9.5 billion, bringing it closer to the 2024 full-year gain of 140,538 BTC or $13 billion. Additionally, Strategy’s Bitcoin yield increased slightly to 19.7%, up 0.5%, as the firm targets a 25% YTD yield by the end of 2025. The quarter-to-date yield also ticked up 0.4% to reach 7.8%. Speculation surrounding a major BTC move was confirmed when blockchain analysts identified that Strategy transferred 7,383 BTC worth about $796 million to three new wallets. The transfer was reported by Lookonchain , and was likely for enhanced custody purposes. Historically, Strategy largely maintained a buy-and-hold approach, with only one known instance of selling 704 BTC in December of 2022 before quickly buying back more than it sold just two days later. Ahead of the official announcement, Saylor shared a clip from a 2020 interview with RealVision founder Raoul Pal, which centered around the company’s early conviction in Bitcoin. Saylor described how Strategy took a bold stance by going “irresponsibly long” on Bitcoin starting in August 2020. He explained a long-term vision, and stated that his investment was meant to benefit future generations and that selling wasn’t part of the plan. Saylor explained that even if Bitcoin were to increase a hundredfold, he might only consider borrowing against it rather than selling. BitMine Shifts to Ethereum Strategy Ethereum (ETH) is also picking up some steam as a reserve asset. Bitcoin mining firm BitMine Immersion Technologies announced a $250 million private placement to launch an Ethereum-focused corporate treasury. The deal involves the sale of 55,555,556 common shares at $4.50 each and is expected to close on Thursday, pending approval from the NYSE American. The raise was led by MOZAYYX and included high-profile participants like Founders Fund, Pantera, FalconX, Republic Digital, Kraken, Galaxy Digital, Digital Currency Group, Diametric Capital, Occam Crest Management, and Thomas Lee. Thomas Lee, who is the chairman of BitMine, compared the role of stablecoins in crypto to that of ChatGPT in AI, and suggested that Ethereum stands to benefit significantly from the rising use of stablecoins. Since most stablecoin transactions are conducted on Ethereum, Lee expects ETH to appreciate in value. This move comes amid the broader trend of corporate interest in Ethereum treasuries. Earlier this month, SharpLink Gaming bought 176,271 ETH for $463 million, making it the largest publicly traded holder of Ethereum. The purchase followed SharpLink’s May launch of its ETH treasury and the appointment of Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin as chairman of its board. BitMine previously focused on Bitcoin , but now describes itself as a company committed to both Bitcoin and Ethereum networks with a long-term accumulation strategy. According to BitcoinTreasuries.NET, BitMine currently holds 154 BTC valued at approximately $17 million, placing it 63rd among corporate Bitcoin treasuries .

The funds will be used to buy BTC mining equipment, a new filing by Hut 8 Corp. revealed. Per a Bloomberg report, about $10 million in equity was sold for Bitcoin rather than dollars on Friday, in a new share issuance to private investors. “The Company intends to use the net proceeds to fund its strategic and Bitcoin accumulation goals, which may include, but are not limited to, the purchase of Bitcoin and/or miners,” the filing read. Hut 8 Corp SEC filing . Source: Hut 8 American Bitcoin is a relatively new entity launched in March , which exclusively focuses on industrial-scale Bitcoin mining and strategic Bitcoin reserve development. The company is a majority-owned subsidiary of Hut 8. Eric Trump’s brother, Donald Trump Jr, said in May, “simply buying Bitcoin is only half the story,” adding that mining it becomes a bigger opportunity under favourable economics. Hut 8 Plans American Bitcoin Merger The report added that the company is pursuing a Nasdaq listing through a full stock merger with Gryphon Digital Mining. Following the merger, both the sons of President Trump, Eric Trump, Donald Trump Jr., along with existing shareholders, will retain 98% of the shares in the new entity, a move that was already announced in May . The newly combined entity will operate under the American Bitcoin brand and is expected to carry the ticker symbol “ABTC,” on Nasdaq.

Call Me a Fool If You Want” appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Renowned finance author Robert Kiyosaki has revealed that he bought more Bitcoin, reaffirming his belief that the asset could eventually hit $1 million. Having first entered the market at $6,000, he’s already seen over 1,000% gains with BTC now trading above $107,000. Despite this surge, Kiyosaki isn’t cashing out; he’s buying more, emphasizing the importance of owning Bitcoin over time, not just watching the price move. He encourages buying less and waiting for the right time, and seeing it grow. It will be the best investment policy, according to him. Kiyosaki Prefers the Gamble Bought another Bitcoin today. I realize I could be wrong and a sucker. Would not be the first time in my life I was played for a FOOL. Yet I believe Bitcoin will one day soon….be $1 million a coin. If I am a sucker…. I’d rather be a sucker than a LOSER if Bitcoin does go to… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) July 1, 2025 In a refreshingly honest post on X, Kiyosaki admitted the possibility of being wrong, even “played for a fool.” Still, he said he’d rather take the risk of being a “sucker” than miss out completely. His message was about the mindset of a long-term investor who loves to take calculated risks and has conviction in long-term value, not just chasing trends or trying to time the market. Moreover, Bitcoin has already broken past $111,900, proving its resilience and growth potential. To reach Robert Kiyosaki’s bold $1 million target , it would need to rise about 855% from current levels. Still, Kiyosaki remains confident, pointing to Bitcoin’s past performance and upcoming events like the halving to support his long-term outlook. [post_titles_links postid=”476909″] His Advice to Investors In a reflective tone, Kiyosaki acknowledged that he can afford to lose the $100,000 investment because of his past, where he’s been both a sucker and a loser, but gained “wisdom and experience” through those failures. He encouraged followers to think for themselves rather than blindly follow influencers or online sentiment. Rather than hyping Bitcoin to his audience, Kiyosaki left his post with a grounded reminder: “Think for yourself.” His approach blends personal insight with a broader lesson he has gained, which often comes with failure, and it’s better to take calculated risks than live with regret. As Bitcoin continues to test new highs and draw institutional interest , Kiyosaki’s faith in its future may resonate with many retail investors watching from the sidelines.

2025-07-01T05:20:07,"Bitcoin’s Astonishing Evolution: A New Trading Pattern Emerges","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Astonishing Evolution: A New Trading Pattern Emerges Are you witnessing a quiet revolution in the financial world? For years, Bitcoin, the pioneering cryptocurrency, has been a wild card, often moving in unpredictable ways, sometimes even mirroring the frenetic energy of meme stocks. But something fundamental is shifting. The Bitcoin trading pattern is evolving, suggesting a newfound maturity and a stronger alignment with established financial assets. This isn’t just speculation; market analysts are observing concrete changes that could redefine Bitcoin’s role in investment portfolios. Unpacking the Evolving Bitcoin Trading Pattern : What’s Changed? Adam Parker, the insightful founder of Trivariate Research, recently highlighted a significant transformation in how Bitcoin behaves in the market. He noted a distinct change, stating that “Bitcoin appears to be trading slightly differently now than previously, with an increasingly higher correlation to high-quality growth stocks than hyper-growth junk stocks, which it was more correlated to previously.” This observation is crucial. Historically, Bitcoin’s price movements were often erratic, sometimes mirroring the speculative frenzy seen in assets like meme stocks – driven more by social media hype and retail speculation than fundamental value or traditional market indicators. This shift indicates a move away from its ‘digital wild west’ perception towards a more stable, mature asset class. What does this mean for investors? It suggests that Bitcoin might be shedding some of its extreme volatility and becoming a more predictable component within a diversified portfolio. Instead of being solely a speculative play, it’s starting to behave more like a legitimate technology or innovation-driven investment. The Power of Institutional Adoption : Fueling Bitcoin’s Ascent One of the most compelling drivers behind Bitcoin’s changing dynamics is the surging interest from traditional financial markets. This isn’t just about individual investors dabbling in crypto; it’s about major financial institutions, asset managers, and even sovereign wealth funds beginning to allocate significant capital to Bitcoin. This institutional adoption is a monumental vote of confidence, signaling that the cryptocurrency is increasingly being viewed as a legitimate, long-term asset. Consider the staggering inflow of capital into regulated investment vehicles. A prime example is BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). In just the past month, this single ETF has seen an astounding $4 billion flow into it. This isn’t retail speculation; this is serious institutional money seeking exposure to Bitcoin through a familiar, regulated product. These inflows bring: Increased Liquidity: More capital means deeper markets, making large trades easier without causing significant price swings. Enhanced Legitimacy: When titans like BlackRock offer Bitcoin products, it signals to the broader financial world that Bitcoin is here to stay. Broader Access: ETFs make Bitcoin accessible to a wider range of investors, including those who cannot or prefer not to directly hold cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Comfort: Regulated products like ETFs provide a layer of oversight and investor protection that appeals to traditional finance. This influx of institutional capital is not just a temporary trend; it represents a fundamental shift in how the financial world perceives and interacts with digital assets. Why Bitcoin is Aligning with Growth Stocks , Not ‘Junk Stocks’ The observation that Bitcoin is now more correlated with ‘high-quality growth stocks’ is profound. What does this correlation signify? High-quality growth stocks typically belong to companies with strong fundamentals, innovative technologies, and sustainable business models – think tech giants or pioneering biotech firms. In contrast, ‘hyper-growth junk stocks’ often refer to highly speculative companies with unproven business models, high debt, or those that see extreme volatility based on hype rather than inherent value. Here’s what this shift implies: Maturity as an Asset: Bitcoin is moving beyond being a purely speculative asset. Its correlation with stable growth companies suggests it’s being valued for its technological innovation, network effects, and potential as a store of value, much like a disruptive tech company. Investor Demographics: This shift points to a changing investor base. While retail investors still play a role, the increasing influence of institutional money means more sophisticated investors are applying traditional valuation metrics and long-term strategies to Bitcoin. Economic Sensitivity: If Bitcoin moves with growth stocks, it implies it’s becoming more sensitive to broader economic indicators that affect these companies, such as interest rates, technological advancements, and overall market sentiment regarding innovation. This evolving correlation is a strong indicator that Bitcoin is maturing into a significant asset within the broader financial ecosystem, offering a different risk-reward profile than it did in its earlier days. Navigating the Broader Crypto Market Landscape The changes observed in Bitcoin’s trading pattern have significant implications for the entire crypto market . As Bitcoin gains more legitimacy and institutional backing, it often sets the tone for altcoins and the broader digital asset space. A more stable, institutionally-backed Bitcoin could lead to: Reduced Volatility Across the Board: While crypto will always have some inherent volatility, Bitcoin’s stabilization could ripple through the market, leading to more predictable movements for other major cryptocurrencies. Increased Confidence: Institutional involvement in Bitcoin can boost overall investor confidence in the crypto market, attracting more capital and innovation. Differentiated Asset Classes: As Bitcoin matures, other cryptocurrencies might find their niche, either as utility tokens, DeFi protocols, or other specialized assets, leading to a more segmented and mature market. However, challenges remain. Regulatory clarity is still evolving globally, and the market is always subject to macroeconomic pressures. Investors should continue to perform thorough due diligence and understand the unique risks associated with each digital asset. The Transformative Impact of Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows The success of the spot Bitcoin ETF , particularly BlackRock’s significant inflows, cannot be overstated. A spot ETF holds the actual underlying asset – in this case, Bitcoin – directly. This is a crucial distinction from futures ETFs, which track Bitcoin’s price through futures contracts. The ability for traditional investors to gain direct exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements through a regulated, easily tradable vehicle is a game-changer. The $4 billion flowing into BlackRock’s ETF alone is a testament to the pent-up demand from institutions and wealth managers who previously lacked a convenient and compliant way to invest in Bitcoin. This capital injection has multiple impacts: Supply-Demand Dynamics: As ETFs accumulate Bitcoin to back their shares, it creates consistent buying pressure, potentially reducing the available supply on exchanges and supporting price appreciation. Validation of Bitcoin’s Value: The approval and subsequent success of these ETFs by major financial regulators (like the SEC in the U.S.) lend immense credibility to Bitcoin as a legitimate financial asset. Gateway for New Capital: ETFs act as a bridge, allowing vast pools of capital from pension funds, endowments, and institutional portfolios to flow into the Bitcoin ecosystem. This is not merely a short-term pump; it’s a structural change that integrates Bitcoin more deeply into the global financial system, paving the way for further mainstream adoption and stability. Actionable Insights for Investors Given these significant shifts, what should investors consider? Re-evaluate Bitcoin’s Role: Bitcoin may no longer be just a high-risk, high-reward speculative asset. Its increasing correlation with quality growth stocks suggests it could play a role in diversified portfolios, potentially as a hedge against traditional inflation or as a long-term growth asset. Monitor Institutional Flows: Keep an eye on ETF inflows and other institutional interest indicators. These can provide valuable insights into market sentiment and potential price movements. Understand the Macro Landscape: As Bitcoin integrates more with traditional finance, its price may become more influenced by macroeconomic factors like interest rates, inflation data, and global economic stability. Long-Term Perspective: The institutional shift points towards a longer-term validation of Bitcoin. While short-term volatility will persist, the underlying trend appears to be one of increasing maturity and integration. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Bitcoin The narrative around Bitcoin is undeniably changing. From its early days as a niche digital currency associated with speculative trading, it is steadily evolving into a recognized financial asset with increasing institutional backing and a more predictable trading pattern. The observation of its correlation with high-quality growth stocks, coupled with the massive inflows into spot Bitcoin ETF products, paints a compelling picture of an asset gaining maturity and legitimacy. This shift marks a pivotal moment for the crypto market , signaling a future where Bitcoin is not just a digital curiosity but a foundational element within the broader investment landscape. As institutional adoption continues to accelerate, Bitcoin’s journey from fringe asset to mainstream financial instrument appears to be well underway, promising exciting developments for investors and the global economy alike.

2025-07-01T05:00:38,"Bitcoin Market Enters Caution Zone Amid Rising Sell-Side Pressure, Analyst Says","Although Bitcoin (BTC) has recorded slight gains over the past month – up 3.6% in the last 30 days – the leading cryptocurrency is experiencing a lack of Apparent Demand, indicating broader market weakness that could lead to a price slump in the near term. Bitcoin Apparent Demand Enters Negative Territory According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Crazzyblockk, Bitcoin’s new buyer demand is failing to absorb the combined supply pressure from freshly mined BTC and selling from long-term holders (LTHs). As a result, BTC’s Apparent Demand has turned negative. The analyst noted that the imbalance between buyer demand and excessive supply has created a high-risk environment for a near-term price correction. Notably, the $100,000 level remains an important support for the flagship digital asset. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weak Hands Exit While Smart Money Loads Up – Is A Breakout Near? For the uninitiated, Bitcoin’s Apparent Demand measures the balance between new buying interest and the supply of coins entering the market from miners and LTHs selling. When this metric turns negative, it means that the amount of BTC being sold exceeds new purchases, indicating potential market weakness and downward price pressure. BTC entering negative Apparent Demand territory can be considered a bearish development for two key reasons. First, it directly increases the “for sale” BTC supply, exerting downward pressure on the cryptocurrency’s price. Second, significant selling by LTHs – often considered seasoned and sophisticated investors – suggests that experienced players believe the crypto market has likely reached a local top and are exiting before a potential severe market downturn. The analyst added: Consequently, the market is in a vulnerable state. Any price rallies from here will likely struggle to overcome this wave of available supply, and market support may be weaker than anticipated. While not a guarantee, this on-chain signal strongly suggests a period of caution is warranted until demand shows clear signs of recovery. That said, recent on-chain analysis indicates a more optimistic outlook. According to fellow CryptoQuant analyst Avocado_onchain, the 30-day moving average (MA) of Bitcoin Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) shows signs of healthy consolidation rather than a potential local top. Some Positive Signs For BTC While BTC’s Apparent Demand might be drying up, easing global geopolitical tensions could catalyze a rally in risk-on assets, including cryptocurrencies. Further positive macroeconomic developments may also benefit BTC, potentially leading to a cycle top much higher than currently anticipated. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Surprise Bears: $100K–$110K Range Shows Rising Short Interest Another indicator negating the possibility of a major price pullback is the steadily rising short-term holder (STH) floor price, which has surged to as high as $98,000 according to the latest on-chain data. At press time, BTC trades at $107,500, down 0.5% in the past 24 hours.

2025-07-01T04:59:53,"XRP, TRX, DOGE Lead Majors With Positive Funding Rates as Bitcoin's Traditionally Weak Quarter Begins","A key metric called perpetual funding rates is signaling bullishness for top altcoins as bitcoin (BTC) kicks off the traditionally weak third quarter quarter with flat price action. Funding rates, charged by exchanges every eight hours, refer to the cost of holding bullish long or bearish short positions in the perpetual (perps) futures (with no expiry). A positive funding rate indicates that perps are trading at a premium to the spot price, necessitating a payment from longs to shorts to maintain bullish bets. Therefore, positive rates are interpreted as representing bullish sentiment, while negative rates suggest otherwise. As of writing, perps tied to payments-focused token XRP (XRP), the world's fourth-largest digital asset by market value, had an annualized funding rate of nearly 11%, the highest among the top 10 tokens, according to data source Velo. Funding rates for Tron's TRX (TRX) and dogecoin (DOGE) were 10% and 8.4%, respectively, while rates for market leaders bitcoin and ether were marginally positive. In other words, the XRP market demonstrated the strongest demand for leveraged bullish exposure among other major cryptocurrencies, including BTC and ether (ETH). That's consistent with the spike in bullish sentiment for XRP last week, despite the settlement between Ripple and the SEC stalling, as noted by Santiment. Privacy-focused monero (XMR) stood among tokens beyond the top 10 list with a funding rate of over 23%, while Stellar's XLM token signaled a strong bias for bearish bets with a funding rate of 24%. Seasonally weak quarter Historically, the third quarter has been a weak period for bitcoin, with data indicating an average gain of 5.57% since 2013, according to Coinglass . That's a far cry compared to the fourth quarter's 85% average gain. BTC's spot price remained flat at around $107,000 at press time, offering no clear direction bias. Valuations have been stuck largely between $100,000 and $110,000 for nearly 50 days, with selling by long-term holder wallets counteracting persistent inflows into the U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Some analysts, however, expect a significant move to occur soon, with all eyes on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's speech on Tuesday and the release of nonfarm payrolls on Friday.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/01/xrp-trx-doge-lead-majors-with-positive-funding-rates-as-bitcoin-s-traditionally-weak-quarter-begins,"BTC|TRADING|XRP|DOGE|TRX","Markets|XRP|TRX|DOGE|Bitcoin|Markets|News",cryptocompare

2025-07-01T04:04:59,"XRP News: Are July 3 and August 15 Important for the Ripple-SEC Lawsuit?","The post XRP News: Are July 3 and August 15 Important for the Ripple-SEC Lawsuit? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News There’s been a lot of discussion online about important dates in the ongoing Ripple vs. SEC case , especially July 3 and August 15. But according to legal experts, neither of these dates hold any official importance in the lawsuit. Recently, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced on X (formerly Twitter) that Ripple is officially dropping its cross-appeal in the long-running case with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He also said that the SEC is expected to drop its appeal too, as previously indicated. So what happens next? A user asked, “Since Ripple announced they will not appeal Judge Analisa Torres on the 2nd ruling. What is next for the SEC, Ripple, and the Court?” Former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel explained that the SEC still needs to hold a vote to officially dismiss its appeal. After that, both Ripple and the SEC will need to submit legal papers confirming the dismissal. Only then will the court’s earlier ruling take full effect. [post_titles_links postid=”477123″] When will this happen? There’s no confirmed timeline. Fagel made it clear that no one knows the exact dates. Some people had said July 3 or August 15 as possible milestones, but Fagel stated those dates have no official connection to the case’s current process. For now, it’s a waiting game. The dismissals are expected in the coming weeks, and while it could be done quickly, it might also take a little longer. In short, no big decision is coming on July 3 or August 15. The legal process is moving ahead, but exact dates remain uncertain.

For the lawsuit to be formally closed, the SEC still needs to hold an official vote to dismiss its appeal.
