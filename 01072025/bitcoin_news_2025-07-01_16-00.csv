2025-07-01T13:42:19,"Bitcoin faces rejection — Bearish Divergence signals breakdown potential","Bitcoin is showing signs of exhaustion at the $108,350 resistance zone. With a developing bearish divergence, declining volume, and repeated failures to break higher, price action is at risk of rotating lower toward key support. Bitcoin ( BTC ) has spent the past week consolidating under a major resistance zone near $108,350 — a level that aligns with the value area high of the current trading range. Despite attempts to push higher, price remains capped. Now, a bearish divergence is developing, suggesting the recent rally is losing momentum. If sellers step in at this level, it could trigger a rotation back toward the value area low around $100,960. Key technical points $108,350 Resistance Zone: High time frame resistance with value area high confluence Bearish Divergence: RSI is making lower highs while price pushes higher Declining Volume Profile: Lack of strong demand to break resistance structure BTC/USDT (4H) Chart | Source: TradingView Bitcoin’s rejection from $108,350 has formed a potential lower high, continuing a bearish structure that has been unfolding over the past several weeks. The level itself represents a significant barrier, with multiple rejections confirming it as a supply-heavy zone. Without a decisive breakout, the price is more likely to rotate within the established range. The bearish divergence — where price pushes slightly higher while the RSI weakens — is a typical early warning of exhaustion. This divergence is especially significant when it occurs at key resistance, as it suggests bulls are running out of steam. It also signals that the recent rally may have been driven more by short-term momentum than sustained buying interest.

In the context of technical resistance and divergence, this weakening volume reinforces the bearish bias. For a breakout to occur, strong volume would need to confirm a shift in demand. Without that, price is more likely to roll over and test the next key support — the point of control and eventually the value area low at $100,960. What to expect in the coming price action As long as Bitcoin remains below $108,350, the bias leans bearish. A confirmed rejection backed by increasing sell volume could trigger a clean rotation down toward $100,960. If that level fails, further downside toward the previous swing low may unfold. Alternatively, a reclaim of $108,350 on strong volume would be the first bullish signal and could invalidate the current bearish setup.

Will a bounce take place from there, or could this dip go deeper? Is a major rally awaiting once this dip is complete? $BTC bulls gathering for big push to the upside Bitcoin (BTC) has already touched the top of its bull flag and the price has been rejected. All perfectly serene in the grand scheme of things, given that overbought signals were flashing as the $BTC price had become overstretched. However, with short-term momentum indicators coming down fast to reset, it may not be long before the $BTC bulls get their chance to send the price back up and this time out of the top of the bull flag. Shallow correction may turn around at $106,000 Source: TradingView The short-term 4-hour chart shows how the $BTC price is rolling over after touching the top of the flag. At a level of support now at $106,500, the price could even start reversing back up from here. However, this would be quite a shallow correction, only barely reaching the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level. It would be perfectly reasonable for the bears to bring the price down further, to the $106,000, or even the $104,400 horizontal support level, but with the 4 and 8-hour Stochastic RSI indicators already at the bottom, and the 12-hour nearly there, the $106,000 support level looks to be favourite for the coming bounce. Bull flag breakout to $120,000/$130,000? Source: TradingView The weekly time frame reveals the three main continuation patterns over the last year or so. The previous two patterns, the bull flag and the falling wedge, experienced a lot of consolidation before finally breaking out explosively to the upside. The latest bull flag is smaller, and could be expected to break out a lot quicker. As already mentioned, this current dip down to the horizontal support band could be the last one before the next skyward move up to $120,000 to $130,000. Very importantly, the Stochastic RSI indicators on the weekly will have to turn back up and give the signal of a return to upside price momentum.

2025-07-01T13:30:31,"Connecticut’s Decisive Bitcoin Ban: Unpacking the Impact of HB7082","BitcoinWorld Connecticut’s Decisive Bitcoin Ban: Unpacking the Impact of HB7082 The digital asset world is constantly evolving, and with it, the regulatory landscape. A recent development from the Nutmeg State has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency community: Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont has officially signed a significant piece of legislation into law. This move marks a crucial moment for state-level engagement with virtual currencies, particularly with the new Connecticut Bitcoin ban now on the books. What does this mean for the future of digital assets within the state, and what are the broader implications? Understanding the New Connecticut Bitcoin Ban and HB7082 On July 1, Governor Ned Lamont put his signature on what has been widely dubbed the “Bitcoin Reserve Ban.” This legislation, officially known as HB7082 legislation , isn’t just a simple prohibition; it’s a comprehensive directive outlining the state’s stance on digital assets. At its core, the law explicitly prevents the state of Connecticut from: Accepting Virtual Currencies: The state treasury or any state agency cannot accept Bitcoin or other virtual currencies as payment for taxes, fees, or any other state-related transactions. Holding Virtual Currencies: The state is prohibited from holding virtual currencies in its reserves or any official accounts. This means no state-owned Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any other digital asset. Investing in Virtual Currencies: State funds, including pension funds or investment portfolios managed by the state, are barred from investing in virtual currencies. This aims to insulate state finances from the inherent volatility often associated with crypto markets. Beyond these direct prohibitions, HB7082 also introduces significant new requirements for money transmitters Connecticut operates within its borders. These new stipulations are designed to enhance consumer protection and regulatory oversight, ensuring that entities dealing with virtual currencies adhere to strict operational guidelines. This aspect of the law underscores a growing trend among states to regulate the flow of digital assets, even if they choose not to embrace them at a state level. Why This Virtual Currency Law? Exploring Connecticut’s Stance You might be wondering, what prompted Connecticut to take such a definitive step against virtual currencies? While the official reasoning often centers on fiscal prudence and risk management, several factors likely played a role in the enactment of this virtual currency law : Volatility Concerns: Cryptocurrencies are known for their price swings. States, often tasked with managing public funds responsibly, tend to be risk-averse. Prohibiting direct state exposure to volatile assets like Bitcoin is seen as a way to safeguard taxpayer money from potential downturns. Regulatory Uncertainty: The federal regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Without clear, comprehensive federal guidelines, individual states are left to craft their own rules. Connecticut’s move can be interpreted as a cautious approach in an uncertain environment. Consumer Protection: While the ban primarily targets state interaction with crypto, the added requirements for money transmitters reflect a broader concern for consumer safety. Ensuring licensed entities operate transparently and securely is a key objective for state regulators. Preservation of Traditional Financial Systems: Some policymakers may view widespread state adoption of virtual currencies as a potential destabilizer to existing financial frameworks, preferring to maintain reliance on established fiat systems. This approach contrasts sharply with states like Wyoming or Texas, which have explored more crypto-friendly policies, aiming to attract blockchain innovation. Connecticut’s decision highlights the diverse and often conflicting views on digital assets across the United States. The Broader Implications of Connecticut’s State Crypto Policy The signing of HB7082 is more than just a local news item; it’s a significant indicator of evolving state crypto policy in the U.S. What are the ripple effects of such a ban? Impact on State Finances and Innovation From Connecticut’s perspective, the immediate ‘benefit’ is perceived risk mitigation. By avoiding direct exposure to virtual currencies, the state aims to shield its treasury from potential market downturns. However, this cautious approach also means the state potentially misses out on future growth opportunities that digital assets might offer. It could also signal a less welcoming environment for blockchain companies or crypto startups looking to establish a presence, potentially directing innovation elsewhere. Challenges for Money Transmitters in Connecticut For businesses operating as money transmitters Connecticut , the new requirements under HB7082 will necessitate operational adjustments. These entities, which facilitate the transfer of funds including virtual currencies, will likely face: Increased Compliance Burden: More stringent reporting, licensing, and operational standards. Enhanced Scrutiny: Closer oversight from state regulators regarding their virtual currency activities. Potential Operational Costs: Implementing new compliance measures often comes with additional expenses. This could make it more challenging for smaller crypto-focused money transmitters to operate profitably in the state, potentially leading to consolidation or a shift in business models. A Precedent for Other States? Connecticut’s move could influence other states contemplating their own crypto regulations. While some might see it as a blueprint for risk aversion, others might view it as an overly restrictive approach that stifles innovation. The ongoing debate surrounding digital asset regulation at both federal and state levels means that every new law, like HB7082, adds another layer to the complex tapestry of crypto governance in the U.S. Navigating the Future of State Crypto Policy The signing of the Connecticut Bitcoin ban into law by Governor Lamont serves as a powerful reminder that while cryptocurrencies aim for decentralization, they are still very much subject to traditional governmental oversight. This move reinforces the idea that states are increasingly taking active roles in defining their relationship with digital assets, rather than waiting for federal mandates. For residents and businesses in Connecticut, understanding the nuances of this law is key. While individuals are not prohibited from owning or trading virtual currencies, the state itself has drawn a clear line in the sand regarding its own interaction with them. This creates a distinct regulatory environment that participants in the crypto space must acknowledge. As the digital economy continues to mature, we can expect more states to weigh in on virtual currency regulation. Whether they follow Connecticut’s cautious path or opt for a more embracing stance, these legislative decisions will collectively shape the future of crypto adoption and innovation across the nation. It’s a dynamic landscape where policy decisions today will have lasting impacts on tomorrow’s digital financial ecosystem.

London-listed companies are increasingly expanding their Bitcoin (BTC) treasury strategies. On Tuesday, July 1, the Smarter Web Company acquired an additional 230.05 bitcoins for $25 million. The move puts its total Bitcoin treasury holdings at 773.58 BTC. The Smarter Web Company ( #SWC $TSWCF $3M8.F) RNS Announcement: Bitcoin Purchase.

Please read the RNS on our website: https://t.co/z59Xf4o42m pic.twitter.com/uLYsn79gLt — The Smarter Web Company (@smarterwebuk) July 1, 2025 The company revealed that the acquisition is part of its “The 10 Year Plan” to expand its BTC holdings exponentially. The last purchase came on June 24, when the UK-based web design firm purchased another 196 BTC . The purchase is part of a growing trend where smaller companies are diversifying into Bitcoin to become more attractive to investors. Specifically, Smarter Web Company is originally a web design firm that has since moved into BTC. Smarter Web Company stock price and trading volume | Source: Aquis The strategy was successful, bringing its share price from £4.5 in April to a peak of £500 in June. Still, the firm has also shed 50% of its value since its peak. London-listed firms join Bitcoin treasury race Several London-listed firms are launching their own Bitcoin treasuries , irrespective of their core business. For instance, AI services firm Tao Alpha announced plans to raise £100 million from investors to buy Bitcoin. Tech firms are not the only companies entering the race. Panther Metals, a natural resources company, announced that it had bought one Bitcoin. The firm’s shares were up 81% in June, despite it reporting a £2.2 million loss in 2024. Bitcoin treasuries seem an attractive way for firms to make traders interested in their stock price. Still, according to FT, most of these firms are small-cap and loss-makers, with very small trading volumes. This means that their share price can take off very quickly. However, the firms are also susceptible to major corrections.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded net inflows for the 15th consecutive day, attracting a total of $4.7 billion in capital in the process. Bitcoin ETF Entry Series Continues for Day 15: Total Nears $5 Billion BlackRock’s IBIT fund alone raised $3.8 billion, accounting for 81% of total inflows over the 15-day period. IBIT alone saw net inflows of $112.3 million on Monday, the last trading day of June. Ark Invest and 21Shares’ ARKB fund saw outflows of $10.2 million on the same day, while no transactions were made in the other funds. ETF Store President Nate Geraci said in his statement on the X platform, “There has been money inflow into spot Bitcoin ETFs for 15 consecutive days. We are approaching $5 billion in total. Not this year, just in the last 15 trading days.” Geraci also reminded that this level is the ceiling that some analysts think spot ETFs can reach in their first year. But the momentum of inflows has weakened. Monday’s net inflow of $102.1 million was well below Friday’s $501.2 million and below the 15-day average of $316 million per day. In total, spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted $49.3 billion in net inflows since their launch in January 2024, while attracting $13.8 billion in capital since the beginning of the year, with total assets under management reaching $128 billion. Ethereum ETFs Continue to Rise Spot Ethereum ETFs also saw net inflows of $31.8 million on the same day, with $25.7 million of that amount flowing into Fidelity’s FETH fund. Launched in July 2024, Ethereum ETFs have seen net inflows totaling $4.2 billion to date. Bitcoin briefly rose above $108,000 over the weekend but has since retreated to $106,707 at the start of the week, while Ethereum is currently trading at $2,457 after testing above $2,500. BRN Chief Analyst Valentin Fournier said the slowdown in ETF inflows could indicate waning short-term institutional interest: “This weakens the possibility of Bitcoin breaking above $112,000 anytime soon. However, the medium-term outlook remains positive, especially as institutional treasuries accelerate their Bitcoin purchases.” According to experts, although price action has weakened in the short term, Bitcoin's upside potential remains intact as institutional investors continue to show interest. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-01T13:20:27,"Altcoin Season Index at 21: Bitcoin’s Dominant Grip on the Crypto Market Unveiled","BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Index at 21: Bitcoin’s Dominant Grip on the Crypto Market Unveiled Are you wondering why your altcoin portfolio isn’t soaring as it once did? The latest update from CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index reveals a significant shift, signaling that the crypto market is firmly in Bitcoin Season . This crucial metric, now standing at a low 21, indicates a period where Bitcoin’s performance overshadows that of most alternative cryptocurrencies. Understanding this shift is vital for anyone navigating the dynamic world of digital assets. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Tell Us About Cryptocurrency Trends? The Altcoin Season Index , a widely tracked metric by CoinMarketCap (CMC), provides a clear snapshot of the prevailing sentiment and performance within the crypto market . On July 1, 00:31 UTC, the index registered a score of 21, a slight dip from the previous day’s figure. This low score is a strong indicator that we are currently experiencing a Bitcoin Season . But how exactly does this index work? It’s quite straightforward: The index analyzes the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization on CoinMarketCap over the past 90 days. Crucially, it excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens to provide a pure measure of speculative asset performance. For the market to be considered in Altcoin Season , at least 75% of these top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin during the specified period. Conversely, a Bitcoin Season is declared when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to surpass Bitcoin’s performance. The index scores range from 1 to 100, with higher numbers indicating stronger altcoin performance relative to Bitcoin. A score of 21 clearly places us deep within Bitcoin’s territory. This metric serves as an essential guide for investors, helping them gauge the overall health and direction of cryptocurrency trends , especially concerning the capital flow between Bitcoin and altcoins. Why Is Bitcoin Dominating the Crypto Market Right Now? The current low reading on the Altcoin Season Index isn’t just a random fluctuation; it reflects underlying forces at play in the broader crypto market . Several factors contribute to Bitcoin’s dominance during a Bitcoin Season : Macroeconomic Uncertainty: In times of global economic instability or high inflation, investors often flock to assets perceived as ‘safe havens.’ Bitcoin, with its larger market cap and established track record, tends to attract capital looking for stability, even within the volatile crypto space. Institutional Interest: A significant portion of institutional investment flows directly into Bitcoin, especially with the advent of spot Bitcoin ETFs. This sustained institutional demand provides a strong foundational support for Bitcoin’s price, often without spilling over into the broader altcoin ecosystem immediately. Liquidity and Market Depth: Bitcoin boasts unparalleled liquidity compared to most altcoins. This makes it easier for large players to enter and exit positions without significantly impacting the price, reinforcing its status as the primary trading pair for many altcoins. Halving Cycle Influence: While not immediate, the post-halving period for Bitcoin often sees a consolidation phase followed by a potential parabolic rise. During this consolidation, altcoins might struggle to gain traction as attention remains on Bitcoin’s price action. Flight to Quality: When the market experiences a downturn or heightened uncertainty, investors tend to reduce exposure to riskier, smaller-cap altcoins and reallocate capital into Bitcoin, which is perceived as less volatile relative to other cryptocurrencies. These combined factors create an environment where Bitcoin acts as the primary driver of the crypto market , absorbing liquidity and attention, which in turn leads to the low Altcoin Season Index score we observe today. Navigating Bitcoin Season: Smart Strategies for Your Altcoin Investments With the Altcoin Season Index signaling a firm Bitcoin Season , it’s natural for altcoin holders to feel a pinch. However, this period also presents unique opportunities for strategic investors. Here are some actionable insights to consider for your altcoin investments : Re-evaluate Your Portfolio: Take this time to assess your altcoin holdings. Are they fundamentally strong projects with real utility and active development? Projects with solid fundamentals are more likely to weather a Bitcoin Season and potentially rebound stronger. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market bottom, consider implementing a DCA strategy for altcoins you believe in. Regularly investing a fixed amount, regardless of price, can average out your purchase price over time, reducing risk. Focus on High-Conviction Projects: During periods of Bitcoin dominance, capital tends to flow into the most robust and innovative altcoin projects. Research emerging narratives, technological breakthroughs, and strong communities that could lead the next wave of Altcoin Season . Risk Management is Key: Volatility can be extreme in a Bitcoin Season . Avoid over-leveraging and ensure your position sizes are appropriate for your risk tolerance. Diversifying across different altcoin sectors (DeFi, NFTs, Layer 2s, Gaming) can also help mitigate risk. Accumulate Bitcoin: Paradoxically, a Bitcoin Season is an excellent time to accumulate more Bitcoin. If Bitcoin continues its upward trajectory, your Bitcoin holdings will appreciate, and you can then strategically reallocate profits into altcoins when the market shifts. By adopting a disciplined and informed approach, you can navigate the current cryptocurrency trends and position yourself for future success, even when the Altcoin Season Index is low. When Will Altcoin Season Return? Analyzing Future Cryptocurrency Trends The burning question for many is: when will the Altcoin Season Index climb back up, signaling the return of a vibrant Altcoin Season ? While no one can predict the future with certainty, historical patterns and market indicators can offer clues about potential triggers for a shift in cryptocurrency trends : Bitcoin Price Consolidation: Historically, a strong Altcoin Season often follows a period where Bitcoin’s price consolidates after a significant rally. This stability allows capital to rotate from Bitcoin into altcoins, seeking higher returns. Increased Market Liquidity: A significant influx of new capital into the overall crypto market , often driven by positive macroeconomic news or broader adoption, can lift all boats, including altcoins. Major Technological Breakthroughs: Breakthroughs or significant upgrades within specific altcoin ecosystems (e.g., Ethereum’s upgrades, new Layer 2 solutions gaining traction) can attract fresh investment and spark rallies. Regulatory Clarity: Positive regulatory developments or a clear framework for digital assets can instill confidence, leading to increased investment across the board, benefiting altcoins disproportionately due to their higher growth potential. Retail Investor Enthusiasm: A renewed surge in interest from retail investors, often fueled by social media buzz and mainstream media coverage, can drive demand for altcoins. Observing these factors and keeping a close eye on the Altcoin Season Index itself will be crucial indicators for when the winds of the crypto market begin to shift back in favor of altcoins. Patience and continuous research are key during this waiting period. Conclusion: Navigating the Shifting Tides of the Crypto Market The current reading of 21 on the Altcoin Season Index clearly signals that the crypto market is in a definitive Bitcoin Season . This period, characterized by Bitcoin’s outperformance, is a natural phase in the cyclical nature of digital assets. While it might present challenges for those solely invested in altcoins, it also offers strategic opportunities for informed investors. By understanding the mechanisms of the Altcoin Season Index , the reasons behind Bitcoin’s current dominance, and implementing smart investment strategies, you can navigate these shifting cryptocurrency trends effectively. Staying updated and adapting your approach will be crucial for long-term success in this ever-evolving market.

2025-07-01T13:19:59,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Slips Below $107,000 As Tariff Deadline Looms","Bitcoin (BTC) slipped below $107,000, starting the week in the red as markets turned cautious ahead of the July 9 US tariff deadline. Broader market sentiment was mixed, with several altcoins registering sharp declines, while others registered marginal increases. The flagship cryptocurrency is down nearly 1% in the past 24 hours, trading around $106,540. Strategy Acquires Another $530M Worth Of Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin treasury company Strategy has acquired another 4,980 BTC for $531.9 million, taking its total stash to 597,325 BTC , valued at over $64 billion. The purchase comes at an average price of $106,801 per BTC . The company has financed recent purchases through a mix of capital raised via common stock (MSTR) and newly issued preferred stock (STRK and STRF). The stocks are part of the company’s at-the-market equity programs. These efforts reflect an $84 million capital raise initiative under Strategy’s 42/42 plan, which will fund Bitcoin purchases until 2027. Strategy founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor is bullish about Bitcoin. Speaking at the BTC Prague conference, he claimed the flagship cryptocurrency could rise to $21 million over the next 21 years. Strategy’s average Bitcoin purchase price sits at $70,982 per coin, resulting in over $21 billion in unrealized gains. The company’s Bitcoin stash has made it the largest publicly traded Bitcoin treasury. Bitcoin (BTC) Sets Record June Close Bitcoin (BTC) closed June in the red, dropping over 1%. However, it held above $107,000 on Monday, closing at $107,167 to achieve its highest monthly close in history. This is a significant milestone for the flagship cryptocurrency, surpassing previous record monthly closes of $104,600 in May and $102,450 in January. Despite the record monthly close, analysts point out that the June candle formed a “pin bar” pattern, characterized by a small body and extended wicks. Bitcoin Miners’ Market Cap Rises The market capitalization of the 13 US-listed Bitcoin mining companies crossed $28 billion on June 27, a 23% month-over-month increase. The growth was driven by miners with high-performance computing (HPC) exposure after reports that CoreWeave was exploring the acquisition of Core Scientific. Despite the jump, the seven-day rolling average network hashrate on June 27 was over 100 EH/s below levels recorded in May. Analysts believe US operators, including Riot, Cipher, and IREN, reduced operations due to the recent heatwave and the resulting increases in spot power pricing. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has started the week in the red as markets turn cautious thanks to the July 9 tariff deadline. The flagship cryptocurrency traded in positive territory over the weekend, registering marginal increases on Friday and Saturday. Price action picked up on Sunday as BTC registered an increase of almost 1% to cross $108,000 and settle at $108,350. However, market sentiment changed on Monday, and the price fell over 1% to $107,167. BTC is down 0.50% during the ongoing session, trading at $106,630. BTC supply in profit registered a sharp increase, rising from 87% to 98% between June 22 and Sunday, according to data from Grassnode. Over 96% of all Bitcoin were in profit as of Tuesday. Historically, such high levels have led to market volatility as profit taking grows. For instance, BTC fell from $109,000to $74,000 between January and April, a drop preceded by the profitable supply rising to 98.8% on January 21. Profitability data also reflects bullish yet cautious market conditions, with the realized profit/loss ratio rising from 1.1 to 2.8, crossing the high band threshold of 2.4. Meanwhile, Bitfinex analysts believe BTC’s rally is losing steam as buying pressure fades and traders lock in their profits. BTC has surged over 40% since dropping to its year-to-date low of $73,273. However, Bitfinex analysts stated that momentum is starting to fade. “For the first time in that uptrend, momentum has begun to fade.” The analysts believe that on-chain metrics and order flow data suggest BTC may be entering a period of consolidation after reaching a local top, with “continued vertical acceleration” on the sidelines for now. “Spot volume has cooled, taker buy pressure has weakened, and profit-taking has intensified — especially among short-term holders who rode the move from sub-$80,000 levels.” However, some analysts, like economist Donald Dean, believe BTC is preparing to move to $130,000. “ BTC - Getting Ready to Move Price Target: $130,981. BTC is getting ready to move higher with tight consolidation at the volume shelf. Also, Cup and Handle. Next target is at the Golden Ratio $130k.” BTC price action was bearish over the previous weekend, dropping 1.18% on Friday and 1.17% on Saturday to settle at $102,180. The price plunged below $100,000 on Sunday as bearish sentiment intensified, falling to a low of $98,385 before recovering to reclaim $100,000 and settle at $100,985. Price action turned bullish as BTC rose over 4% on Monday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,443. Buyers retained control on Tuesday as the price rose 0.66% to cross $106,000 and settle at $106,137. BTC crossed $107,000 on Wednesday after registering an increase of 1.19% and settling at $107,397. Source: TradingView BTC lost momentum on Thursday, dropping 0.39%, slipping below $107,000, and settling at $106,980. It recovered to register marginal increases on Friday and Saturday to reclaim $107,000 and settle at $107,339. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as BTC registered an increase of nearly 1% to cross $108,000 and settle at $108,350. However, BTC started the current week in the red as markets turned cautious thanks to the July 9 tariff deadline looming. As a result, the price fell by over 1% to $107,167. BTC has slipped below $107,000 during the ongoing session, with the price down 0.65% at $106,488. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-07-01T13:00:00,"Bitcoin price prediction 2025-2031: Will BTC hit $150k soon?","Key takeaways: Bitcoin price faces volatility around $106K. Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction.

It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bitcoin faced a surge in bearish pressure as buyers failed to defend support channels. This pushed the BTC price toward $106K. Will the BTC price reach $100K?

Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Following the US, Pakistan announced its first government-backed strategic bitcoin reserve, marking a notable step towards adding crypto assets into its financial strategy. Bitcoin price prediction July 2025 Bitcoin’s price jumped to $109,000, making Q2 its best quarter since 2020. In the second quarter of 2025 alone, it went up by 31%, showing strong market activity and growing investor trust. This rise is partly because, in the past, Bitcoin has often grown a lot after its “halving” events. Analysts think the current market is following the same pattern, which could mean we’ll see a peak around September 2025. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $105,000 and be pushed further, at least $113,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $101,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction July 2025 $101,000 $105,000 $113,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491.

Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction 2030 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970.

2025-07-01T12:55:49,"XRP’s RSI Signals Bullish Reversal—How High Can It Go?","XRP, the native currency of Ripple, is back in the limelight after its Stochastic Relative Strength Index (Stoch RSI) broke above a 14-month downtrend line—a technical event which has analysts and traders murmuring about a potential huge price rally. The sign, first noted by TheCryptoBasic and then corroborated by several independent chartists, suggests XRP's long period of consolidation is likely over, with some price models now indicating the $9 zone—price levels unvisited since the last crypto bull cycle. What Is RSI and Why Is It Important for XRP? Relative Strength Index, or RSI, is an indicator of momentum that measures the speed and magnitude of price direction change, typically used to identify overbought and oversold conditions. The Stoch RSI is a more sensitive version, designed to identify trend reversals sooner by applying the stochastic formula to RSI values rather than price. When Stoch RSI is crossing above a long-term downtrend, this is typically interpreted as a sign that bear momentum is abating and the bulls are gaining control. For XRP, the Stoch RSI had been locked below its midline for over a year, showing persistent selling pressure and price action weakness. The recent breakout, however, is an unmistakable shift in momentum, with the indicator crossing into overbought for the first time since early 2023. Breakout or Bull Trap The technical setup for XRP is compelling. Having traded sideways for months between $0.45 and $0.70, XRP has just moved above its 200-day moving average, a crucial resistance point which capped every rally since the beginning of the SEC lawsuit. The Stoch RSI breakout is further confirmation, with the indicator now mirroring patterns before XRP's historic bull runs in 2017 and 2021. Nevertheless, a warning is due. RSI is presently heading towards overbought (above 70), and past experience has indicated that XRP typically sees sharp pullbacks following such rallies unless joined by a ramp-up in spot trading volume and favorable macro news. Whale Action and Volume Spur Technicals are also positive, supported by on-chain insights. Whale accounts (above 10 million XRP) have accumulated more than 220 million tokens since last month, according to Santiment. Daily active addresses are up 34% since the beginning of June, and network transacting volume is six months high. Big exchanges transfers in and out have also increased significantly, showing institutional and retail traders are setting up for a big move. Retail mania also picks up. Google Trends shows an increase in ”XRP RSI,” ”XRP price prediction,” and ”XRP to $9” searches, similar to the social frenzy in previous bull runs. Twitter is filled with the hashtag #XRP as investors debate whether the RSI breakout is real or just another tease. What Might Stop the Rally? Despite the optimism, there are some risks out there. The outcome of Ripple's ongoing lawsuit against the SEC is uncertain, and bad publicity can quickly turn gains into losses. The broader crypto market volatility, especially for Bitcoin and Ethereum, can also impact XRP's capacity to maintain a breakout. Traders must wait for confirmation in volume, consistent closes above $0.75, and continued stability in the Stoch RSI before declaring victory. The RSI breakout is opportunity and risk to active traders. Some of the strategies include: Momentum Longs: Longing on confirmed closes at resistance levels, and stops beneath the 200-day moving average. Fade the Overbought: Short selling if RSI enters extreme zones (>80) without volume confirmation. Swing Trading: Cutting RSI crossovers and divergence signals to time entry and exit. The Bottom Line XRP's Stoch RSI breakout from a 14-month downtrend is a rare technical event that in the past has been followed by large price rallies. With whale accumulation, growing volume, and through-the-roof retail interest, everything is set for a potential move to $9—if only the momentum holds and outside threats don't intervene. Until then, everyone holds their breath for the charts, the courts, and the big headline.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9767/xrp-s-rsi-signals-bullish-reversal-how-high-can-it-go,"TRADING|XRP|MARKET|REGULATION|BTC","News|Ripple",cryptocompare

BTC crossed $108,500 on Monday but lost momentum and fell to a low of $106,794. The price recovered to reclaim $107,000 before declining and moving to its current level of $106,943, down over 1% in the past 24 hours.

The group is part of the CFTC’s Global Markets Advisory Committee and includes the likes of Goldman Sachs, Citadel, and BlackRock.

The stock soared along with the US equities market, which has registered a substantial uptick, with the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 reaching all-time highs. Higher stock prices result in increased trading volumes for brokerage companies like Robinhood. The company’s shares have also benefited from its exposure to the crypto market. Robinhood has established itself as a major player in the crypto market, recently completing the acquisition of Bitstamp. Analysts believe Robinhood’s growth will continue. The average revenue estimate for the current quarter is $891 million, a 30% year-over-year increase. Annual revenue is expected to grow 23% to $3.6 billion this year and $4.24 billion next year. The platform plans to increase its growth by launching banking solutions, tokenized products, and international expansion. Wall Street Divided On Circle Stock Price Wall Street firms began their coverage of Circle’s stock after the mandatory quiet period ended, with Bernstein, Barclays, and JPMorgan releasing their ratings and price targets. Barclays, Needham, Canaccord Genuity, and Bernstein see Circle’s target price above $200, implying an upside potential of $15 per share from its current price. Bernstein analysts stated, “CRCL is building a market-leading digital dollar stablecoin network, with a strong regulatory edge, liquidity headstart, and marquee distribution partnerships. This is hard to replicate, in our view.” However, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs believe the stock is overvalued and set a target of $80, significantly lower than the current trading price of $185. Kenneth Washington, analyst at JPMorgan, praised Circle’s business model, adding it had a first-mover advantage, stating, “Circle and USDC have an early-mover advantage in what has been a winner-takes-most market, driving USDC market capitalization to $62 billion. We think highly of the Circle management team and are confident in the outlook for outsized stablecoin and USDC growth. However, we see Circle’s current market capitalization elevated.” Goldman Sachs agreed with the assessment, starting the coverage with a neutral rating. “Together, pending global stablecoin regulation that should favor adoption of compliant stablecoins like USDC, as well as continued new partnerships, should drive continued market share gains. We view CRCL’s business and growth attractively, but valuation appears elevated.” Circle Applies For US Trust Bank Charter To Manage USDC Reserves Circle, the entity behind the USDC stablecoin, has applied to establish a national trust bank in the US to manage its USDC reserve. If the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) approves the application, Circle’s First National Digital Currency Bank would be authorized to operate as a federally regulated trust institution. The digital bank will also strengthen the infrastructure supporting the issuance of USDC and offer digital asset custody services to institutional customers. “Circle Internet Group, Inc. (NYSE: CRCL), a global financial technology company and stablecoin market leader, has formally submitted an application to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to establish a national trust bank, First National Digital Currency Bank, N.A. If approved, First National Digital Currency Bank, N.A. would be authorized to operate as a federally regulated trust institution, subject to OCC oversight.” IRS Can Access Coinbase User Data Without Warrants The US Supreme Court declined an appeal against allowing the IRS to access user data from Coinbase without a warrant. James Harper, a Coinbase user, had sued the IRS, calling its actions an “unconstitutional overreach.” The court also did not impose any limitations on the IRS and how it collects user data. The court ruling allows the IRS to access the data of over 14,000 Coinbase users, originally requested in a 2016 summons. In his appeal, Harper stated that the IRS’s sweeping demands violated his Fourth Amendment protections. In a separate lawsuit, Harper contested that the request constituted an unreasonable search and seizure. However, the District and Appeals Courts both ruled in favor of the IRS, arguing that individuals did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy when voluntarily submitting data to third-party services. The Supreme Court ruling means Harper has exhausted all legal avenues. However, legal experts have warned that the implications of the ruling could extend beyond crypto and normalize broad surveillance powers across tech and financial platforms. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) extended its losses for a second day as sellers continue to dominate price action. The flagship cryptocurrency traded in positive territory over the weekend, registering marginal increases on Friday and Saturday. Price action picked up on Sunday as BTC rose almost 1% to cross $108,000 and move to $108,350. However, it lost momentum on Monday, slipping below $108,000 and settling at $107,167. The current session sees BTC trading around $106,850. Analysts believe BTC’s rally is losing steam as buying pressure wanes and traders begin locking in their profits. BTC has surged over 40% since falling to its year-to-date low of $73,273. However, Bitfinex analysts stated that momentum is starting to fade. “For the first time in that uptrend, momentum has begun to fade.” The analysts believe that on-chain metrics and order flow data suggest BTC may be entering a period of consolidation after reaching a local top, with “continued vertical acceleration” on the sidelines for now. “Spot volume has cooled, taker buy pressure has weakened, and profit-taking has intensified — especially among short-term holders who rode the move from sub-$80,000 levels.” However, some analysts remain bullish about BTC’s price action. Economist Donald Dean believes BTC is preparing to move to $130,000. BTC - Getting Ready to Move Price Target: $130,981. BTC is getting ready to move higher with tight consolidation at the volume shelf. Also, Cup and Handle. Next target is at the Golden Ratio $130k.” Others like Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards believe BTC’s uptrend will resume when long-term holders stop selling the asset. The selling has adversely impacted price action despite surging interest from institutional investors. “People are wondering why BTC has been stuck at $100K so long, despite the institutional FOMO,” adding that this is mainly due to Bitcoin OGs — long-term holders — who have been “dumping on Wall Street and unloading their positions.” BTC’s next price action depends on institutional demand, macroeconomic factors, and ETF inflows. US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs have registered inflows for 14 consecutive trading days. The flagship cryptocurrency registered $2.2 billion in inflows last week, with analysts expecting a continuation this week. “Massive inflows into US Bitcoin ETFs last week! $2.2 billion! This ranks among the top 10 weeks since inception. 70% chance next week will be positive too, which generally correlates to upward price pressure.” BTC traded in bearish territory last weekend, dropping 1.18% on Friday (June 20), slipping below the 50-day SMA and settling at $103,388. Sellers retained control on Saturday as the price fell 1.17%, dropping to a low of $100,979 before settling at $102,180. BTC plunged below $100,000 on Sunday as selling pressure intensified, falling to a low of $98,385. The price rebounded from this level to reclaim $100,000 and settle at $100,985. BTC rallied on Monday, rising over 4% to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,443. Buyers retained control on Tuesday as the price crossed the moving averages, reclaimed $106,000, and settled at $106,137. Source: TradingView BTC continued pushing higher on Wednesday, rising 1.19% to cross $107,000 and settle at $107,397. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC lost momentum on Thursday, dropping 0.39% to $106,980. The price registered marginal increases on Friday and Saturday, reclaiming $107,000 and settling at $107,339. Price action picked up on Sunday as BTC rose almost 1% to cross $108,000 and settle at $108,350. BTC started the current week in the red, dropping 1.09% as bullish sentiment began waning. The current session sees BTC marginally down as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) has not made a positive start to the week, losing momentum after reaching $2,500 on Sunday. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency slipped below $2500 on Monday after registering a drop of 0.55%. The price continued dropping during the ongoing session, and is down over 1%, trading below the 20-day SMA. Despite a sluggish start to the week, some analysts predict a 100% rally that could drive ETH to $5,000. The analysts pointed out that the ETH price chart is showing a textbook “Power of 3” setup after a trend deviation between $2,100 and $2,200, which took place last Sunday. The Power of 3 model, also known as AMD (Accumulation, Manipulation, and Distribution), allows traders to understand institutional investor trading strategies around key liquidity zones. Analysts point out that the accumulation phase, marked by sideways price action, occurred between May 9 and June 20. During the accumulation phase, market participants build positions and create the groundwork for a bigger move. The accumulation phase was followed by the manipulation phase, which saw a breakdown below $2,200 as large traders attempted to create panic among retail investors and force premature selling, only to reverse against the move. Sure enough, ETH rebounded from $2,200 to $2,500. Analysts argue that ETH is at the beginning of the distribution phase, with price action set to move in the opposite direction. ETH registered a sharp drop on Friday, falling nearly 5%, slipping below $2,500 and the 50-day SMA to $2,406. Sellers retained control on Saturday as the price fell 4.56%, falling below $2,300 and settling at $2,296. ETH plunged to an intraday low of $2,119 on Sunday before recovering to reclaim $2,200 and settle at $2,229. The price rallied on Monday, rising over 8% to cross $2,400 and settle at $2,413. ETH continued pushing higher on Tuesday, rising 1.51% to $2,450, but lost momentum on Wednesday, falling 1.26% to $2,419. Source: TradingView The price raced to an intraday high of $2,531 on Thursday as buyers attempted a move past the 20-day SMA. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped to $2,415, ultimately registering a marginal decline. ETH registered marginal increases on Friday and Saturday to settle at $2,437. It registered a sharp increase on Sunday as bullish sentiment intensified, rising to $2,500. ETH started the current week in the red, falling 0.55% to $2,486. The current session sees the price down 1.24%, trading around $2,455. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) briefly surged to $160 on Monday after the Solana ETF launch with staking drew considerable excitement. However, it could not sustain momentum and has registered a substantial decline during the ongoing session, down 3.52%. The news of the ETF launch created speculation about whether institutional demand would return. However, it has remained muted, prompting SOL to drop from $160 to $154. ETF provider REX Shares partnered with Osprey Funds to establish a taxable C-corporation, bypassing the usual Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval process. This enables a faster and smoother launch. However, traders adjusted their expectations after the initial euphoria, recognizing that similar products could be launched for other altcoins. Additionally, Grayscale’s Solana Trust (GSOL), which has traded for two years, manages only $75 million in assets. Selling pressure could increase due to SOL staking unlocks and Solana-based decentralized applications. According to data from DeFiLlama, $585 million worth of SOL will be unlocked over the next two months. SOL registered a sharp decline on Friday, falling nearly 5% to $140 as it started the previous week in the red. The price continued dropping on Saturday, falling to a low of $131 before settling at $135. SOL plunged to an intraday low of $126 on Sunday. However, it recovered from this level to reclaim $130 and settle at $131. The price rallied on Monday, rising nearly 10% to reclaim $140 and settle at $144. Buyers retained control on Tuesday as SOL rose almost 1% to $145. The price lost momentum on Wednesday, falling nearly 2% and settling at $143. Source: TradingView SOL attempted a move past the 20-day SMA on Thursday, reaching an intraday high of $147. However, it failed to push higher and fell over 3%, slipping below $140 and settling at $139. The price recovered on Friday, rising 2.21% to reclaim $140 and settle at $142. Bullish sentiment intensified on Saturday as SOL rose over 6%, crossing the 20-day SMA and settling at $150. Buyers retained control on Sunday with the price rising almost 2% to $153. SOL surged to an intraday high of $160 on Monday thanks to the Solana ETF launch. However, it could not stay at that level and settled at $154. The current session sees SOL down 4%, having slipped below $150 and trading around $148. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Analysis Dogecoin (DOGE) started the week with a sharp drop after it failed to cross the 20-day SMA. The popular memecoin is down over 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $0.161. DOGE traded in the red the previous weekend, dropping almost 5% on Friday and 4.81% on Saturday to settle at $0.154. The price plunged to an intraday low of $0.143 on Sunday as bearish sentiment intensified, but recovered to settle at $0.151, ultimately registering a drop of 1.81%. Price action flipped to bullish on Monday as DOGE rallied, rising nearly 8% to cross $0.160 and settle at $0.163. Buyers retained control on Tuesday as the price registered an increase of 0.92% and moved to $0.165. Source: TradingView DOGE remained stationary on Wednesday before dropping 3.51% on Thursday and settling at $0.159. Despite the bearish sentiment, the price recovered, rising 1.38% on Friday and 0.99% on Saturday to settle at $0.163. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as DOGE rose nearly 4% and settled at $0.169. However, it was back in the red on Monday, dropping 2.37% to $0.165. Sellers have retained control during the ongoing session, with the price down over 2%, trading at $0.161. Jupiter (JUP) Price Analysis Jupiter (JUP) started the previous weekend in the red, dropping 6.56% on Friday and over 5% on Saturday to settle at $0.358. Selling pressure intensified on Sunday as the price plunged to a low of $0.326 before settling at $0.345, ultimately registering a drop of almost 4%. JUP made a strong recovery on Monday, rising over 17% to cross $0.40 and settle at $0.404. The price continued pushing higher on Tuesday and settled at $0.418. However, it lost momentum on Wednesday, falling over 2% to $0.410. Source: TradingView Selling pressure intensified on Thursday as JUP fell 3.99%, slipping below $0.40 and settling at $0.393. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, JUP recovered on Friday, rising over 3% to reclaim $0.40 and settle at $0.405.

2025-07-01T12:45:52,"Bitcoin set for ranged trading as Q3 begins: Bitfinex","Bitcoin price hovers near $107,000 as the benchmark digital asset signals further consolidation following a largely positive run from lows of $84k seen in April. Bitfinex analysts, sharing their outlook for Bitcoin ( BTC ) in the next quarter, say the struggle for a breakout to $110,000 or higher in recent weeks signals a potential consolidation phase in Q3, 2025. Analysts at the crypto exchange noted this in the Bitfinex Alpha report published on Monday, June 30. Notably, BTC is experiencing a slowdown in on-chain and derivatives activity. This comes after bulls recovered from recent lows , helped by a period of volatility punctuated by the market reaction to geopolitical tensions amid the Israel-Iran conflict. The macroeconomic environment also dictated action for risk assets. You might also like: S&P 500 continues rally as investors bet on trade talks Bitcoin price historically sees an average of +6% in Q3 While Bitcoin may yet experience a sharp uptick amid other market factors, Bitfinex Alpha analysts say Q3 will likely see range bound trading beginning in July. A dearth of upside momentum, including in the exchange-traded funds market, could see BTC mirror the average of just 6% gain between July and end of September seen in this period since 2013. The less optimistic perspective is despite the market having flushed out excess leverage. “The recent compression in price action reflects a cooling in both on-chain and derivatives activity, with declining spot volumes, reduced taker buy pressure, and a drop in open interest, highlighting that the market is transitioning from an aggressive impulse to a ranging phase,” the analysts noted. In terms of Bitcoin’s key levels, $100k remains a major support area. However, the short-term holder’s realized price level at $98,700 offers a critical structural zone, where dip buyers will fancy opportunities for accumulation. Meanwhile, BTC bulls may target a breakout above $110k. Yet, Q3 has historically been a period of low volatility and subdued directional movement. With an average of just +6%, price action will be more within a consolidation range. “For new all-time highs to be reclaimed, a catalyst, either in the form of macro relief, strong ETF flow momentum, or a breakout in global liquidity will be necessary,” the analysts wrote.

2025-07-01T12:45:09,"Bad News Came From The USA For Bitcoin (BTC) This Time! A State Has Imposed Radical Bans On Bitcoin And Cryptocurrencies!","While positive news about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies came from US states one after another, news of a ban came from one state. Accordingly, a bill banning cryptocurrencies in the US state of Connecticut has become law. Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont has officially signed into law HB 7082, a bill that prohibits the state from accepting, holding, or investing in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. HB 7082 prohibits the state from accepting, investing in, or holding any cryptocurrency. This new law marks a significant step forward in the state’s approach to digital currencies, effectively banning Bitcoin reserves.

Bloomberg Analysts Announced the Altcoins with the Highest Probability of Approval: One of Them is XRP! “Neither the state nor any political subdivision of the state may accept or solicit payment in the form of cryptocurrency or purchase, hold, invest in, or establish a reserve of cryptocurrency,” HB 7082 states. While some industry experts say the bill is crucial for addressing the risks of cryptocurrencies, others say it stifles innovation in the state and country. Connecticut’s move sets it apart from other US states such as Texas, Arizona, and New Hampshire and highlights the state-level divide in crypto policy. In May, New Hampshire became the first state to enact the “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” (SBR) model by passing the first law allowing digital assets to be used at the state treasury level. Apart from New Hampshire, Texas and Arizona have also taken important steps in Bitcoin and digital asset reserves. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-01T12:44:49,"Top 3 altcoins to buy in July if Bitcoin price breaks out","The Bitcoin price could be on the verge of a strong bullish breakout in July, following the formation of cup-and-handle and bullish flag patterns, and as ETF inflows surge. A surge in Bitcoin ( BTC ) above its all-time high of $111,900 will likely spark further gains among altcoins. That’s because, historically, many altcoins do better than BTC when it is in a strong uptrend. This article explores three top altcoins to buy for huge gains if Bitcoin price breaks out above its all-time high of $111,900. Sei Sei ( SEI ), a layer-1 network, is one of the best altcoins to buy for substantial gains if Bitcoin rallies. It has strong fundamentals and technicals that may help to drive the surge. Fundamentally, Sei is one of the top blockchains being considered by Wyoming for its stablecoin. A win would be a highly bullish thing for the coin because it will vindicate its model. Sei has become the biggest chain in the gaming industry, overtaking other gaming-focused chains like Ronin and Immutable. More data shows that its daily active addresses have jumped by 27% to 581,000. Nansen data reveals that its active transactions jumped by 136% in the last 30 days to nearly 40 million. Technicals suggest that the Sei price has more upside now that it has surged above the 23.6% retracement level and the 50-day moving average. If this happens, it may jump by 50% to $0.4370. Sei price chart | Source: crypto.news Binance Coin Binance Coin ( BNB ) is another top altcoin to buy if Bitcoin makes a strong bullish breakout. It has some of the best fundamentals in the crypto market today. For example, BNB Chain’s monthly transactions increased by 152% in June to over 420 million, surpassing Ethereum ( ETH ), which had 41 million transactions. BSC Chain also became the most active networks in the decentralized exchange industry. It had its best month ever, handling over $150 billion, surpassing the combined total of Solana and Ethereum. BNB token also has a high staking yield of 8%, also higher than its closest competitors. As crypto.news reported on Monday, technical indicators suggest that it has more upside, potentially reaching the year-to-date high of nearly $700. You might also like: Mastercard joins forces with Bitget Wallet to release zero-fee crypto cards Hyperliquid Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) is another top-quality altcoin to buy because of its growing market share in the perpetual trading and layer-1 industries. Its perpetual exchange handled over $216 billion in transactions in June, giving it a market dominance of over 60%. In contrast, Jupiter and Apex Protocol, and RabbitX networks handled less than $20 billion each. Hyperliquid’s layer-1 network had a total value locked of $2.17 billion, up by 33% from the previous month. Its stablecoin supply jumped to over $3.27 billion, passing Cardano’s $31 million. Therefore, these fundamentals, together with HYPE’s high staking yield, will likely push its price higher. Other quality altcoins to buy There are many other altcoins to buy if Bitcoin makes a bullish breakout. Popular meme coins like Dogwifhat and Fartcoin will lead the charge, while utility altcoins like Quant and Chainlink will also jump.

2025-07-01T12:44:07,"Top 4 catalysts that could ignite the next crypto bull run","Crypto prices were mixed in the first half of the year, with Bitcoin surging to a record high and most altcoins experiencing double-digit declines. This performance was largely due to Donald Trump’s trade wars, which eroded regulatory clarity in the US. Still, four key catalysts could trigger a crypto bull run in the year’s second half. Bitcoin price breakout could stir a crypto bull run The first main catalyst that could ignite a crypto bull run is Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) breakout. The daily chart above shows that it has formed a giant cup-and-handle pattern, and is now in its final stage. This cup has a depth of about 30%, meaning that the coin could soar to over $140,000 in the coming months. This target is derived by measuring the same distance from the cup’s upper side. Bitcoin price has also formed a bullish flag pattern, which is made up of a vertical line and a downward channel. Like the C&H, the bullish flag pattern leads to a strong breakout. BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news The other catalyst is that Bitcoin is about to break above the ascending trendline that connects the highest swings since December 2017. Moving above that level will likely lead to more upside. BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news You might also like: Arbitrum price tanks after highly anticipated Robinhood partnership Federal Reserve interest rate cuts The other potential catalyst for the next crypto bull run will come from the Federal Reserve, which is expected to start cutting rates later this year. Most economists expect the bank to start easing in the September meeting if inflation remains contained. In a statement on Monday, Goldman Sachs analysts estimate that the bank will deliver three cuts this year and more in 2026. Morgan Stanley analysts are more dovish, estimating that the bank will cut rates seven times next year. Their belief is that the next Fed Chair will be more inclined to slash rates than Jerome Powell. Cryptocurrencies and other risky assets often do well when the Fed is cutting rates. This hope partly explains why the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 Indices have soared to a record high. Crypto ETF approvals The other main catalyst for the next crypto bull run is the potential ETF approvals by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Polymarket odds for the approval of top ETFs , such as Solana ( SOL ), Litecoin ( LTC ), and Ripple ( XRP ), have remained elevated. ETF approvals will be bullish for the crypto market because of the potential inflows from Wall Street investors. For example, Bitcoin ETF inflows have jumped by nearly $50 billion, while Ethereum ETFs have crossed the $4 billion milestone. US M2 growth Finally, the crypto bull run could be influenced by the rising US money supply. Data shows that the M2 figure has jumped to a record high of $21.8 trillion. This growth will likely continue now that Congress is set to approve Donald Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill, which will lead to more budget deficits. Bitcoin price has a close correlation with the US M2 money supply because of its supply cap of 21 million.

2025-07-01T12:40:35,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Navigating Market Sentiment with Caution","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Navigating Market Sentiment with Caution Are you feeling the pulse of the crypto market? The digital asset space is a whirlwind of innovation and excitement, but it’s also notorious for its rapid swings. Understanding the collective mood of investors can be a game-changer, and that’s precisely where the Crypto Fear & Greed Index comes into play. As of July 1st, this popular indicator, provided by software development platform Alternative, registered a value of 64. While this marks a slight dip of two points from the previous day, it firmly keeps us in the ‘Greed’ zone. But what does this really tell us about the current state of the market, and how can you use this information to make more informed decisions? What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does it Matter? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is more than just a number; it’s a powerful tool designed to give you a snapshot of the prevailing emotions in the cryptocurrency market. Ranging from 0 to 100, it paints a clear picture: 0 signifies ‘Extreme Fear’: This often indicates that investors are overly worried, leading to potential overselling. Historically, moments of extreme fear can present buying opportunities for brave investors. 100 signifies ‘Extreme Greed’: Conversely, extreme greed suggests the market might be due for a correction, as assets could be overvalued and susceptible to profit-taking. The index doesn’t predict the future, but it helps gauge the current crypto market sentiment . It’s built on the premise that excessive fear can drive prices down unnecessarily, while excessive greed can inflate them unsustainably. By understanding where the market stands on this emotional spectrum, you can potentially counter your own biases and make more rational investment choices. Deconstructing the Pillars of Crypto Market Sentiment: What Moves the Needle? The index isn’t just a random number; it’s a sophisticated calculation based on a blend of six key factors, each weighted differently to provide a comprehensive view of crypto market sentiment . Let’s break down what influences this crucial indicator: Factor Weight Description Volatility 25% Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility, especially downwards, can signal fear. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Analyzes the current volume and market momentum, comparing it with the last 30 and 90-day averages. High buying volume typically indicates greed, while low volume or selling pressure suggests fear. Social Media 15% Scans various social media platforms (primarily Twitter) for crypto-related hashtags. It assesses the speed and volume of posts, looking for abnormal interactions or sentiment shifts. Surveys 15% Originally, this factor involved weekly polls asking people how they perceive the market. However, it’s important to note that this component is currently paused, meaning its influence on the index is temporarily absent. Bitcoin Dominance 10% Measures Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. An increasing Bitcoin dominance often signals a shift from altcoins back to Bitcoin, which can be interpreted as a flight to safety (fear) or a belief in Bitcoin’s continued strength (greed). Google Trends 10% Examines Google search query data for crypto-related terms. A surge in searches for terms like ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ might indicate fear, while ‘buy Bitcoin’ could suggest growing interest and greed. Each of these components provides a unique lens through which to view the market’s emotional state, collectively contributing to the final index score. The Critical Role of Bitcoin Dominance in Shaping Market Perception You might wonder why Bitcoin dominance holds a dedicated 10% weighting in the index. Bitcoin, as the pioneer and largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, often acts as the bellwether for the entire crypto space. Its performance and perceived stability significantly influence investor behavior across altcoins. High Bitcoin Dominance: When Bitcoin’s dominance rises, it often suggests that investors are moving funds from smaller, more volatile altcoins back into Bitcoin. This ‘flight to quality’ can be a sign of fear, as investors seek the relative safety and liquidity of BTC during uncertain times. Conversely, it can also reflect a strong bullish sentiment specifically for Bitcoin, where investors believe BTC will outperform altcoins. Low Bitcoin Dominance: A decreasing Bitcoin dominance typically indicates an ‘altcoin season,’ where capital flows from Bitcoin into various altcoins, leading to their outperformance. This usually signifies a higher appetite for risk and often aligns with periods of increased greed in the broader market. Therefore, tracking Bitcoin’s market share provides valuable insight into whether the market is in a risk-on or risk-off mood, directly impacting the overall Fear & Greed score and influencing broader cryptocurrency trends . Navigating Market Volatility: A Double-Edged Sword for Investors One of the most defining characteristics of the cryptocurrency space is its inherent market volatility . Unlike traditional assets, crypto prices can swing wildly in short periods, creating both immense opportunities and significant risks. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index dedicates a substantial 25% to this factor, underscoring its importance. High Volatility & Fear: Sharp, sudden drops in price, often accompanied by panic selling, contribute to an increase in the ‘Fear’ component of the index. These moments test investor conviction and can lead to emotional decisions. High Volatility & Greed: On the flip side, parabolic price surges, driven by FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), can also contribute to high volatility. While seemingly positive, such rapid increases can push the index into the ‘Extreme Greed’ zone, signaling an unsustainable rally that might be prone to correction. For investors, understanding how to navigate this volatility is paramount. It requires discipline, a clear investment strategy, and the ability to distinguish between a healthy market correction and a genuine downturn. The index helps by signaling when emotions might be running high, prompting you to re-evaluate your positions with a clear head. Decoding Current Cryptocurrency Trends: What Does ‘Greed’ at 64 Mean Now? The index sitting at 64, firmly in the ‘Greed’ zone, suggests that the market is currently experiencing a relatively positive sentiment. This isn’t ‘extreme greed’ (which would be closer to 80-100), but it indicates that investors are generally optimistic and willing to take on more risk. This level of ‘Greed’ often correlates with: Sustained Price Action: Prices are likely trending upwards, or at least holding steady after a period of growth. Increased Trading Activity: Higher volumes indicate active participation from buyers and sellers. Positive News Flow: Regulatory clarity, institutional adoption, or technological advancements often fuel this optimism. However, it’s crucial to remember that ‘Greed’ can be a double-edged sword. While it feels good to be in a rising market, a moderate ‘Greed’ score can sometimes precede a period of consolidation or even a minor correction as early investors take profits. It’s a reminder to exercise caution and not get swept away by the hype. Keeping an eye on broader cryptocurrency trends , such as macroeconomic indicators, interest rate changes, and global liquidity, is also vital for a holistic view. Actionable Strategies for Investors: Leveraging the Index Wisely So, how can you effectively use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index in your investment strategy? It’s not a direct buy or sell signal, but rather a complementary tool for deeper analysis: Counter-Cyclical Investing: The old adage, “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful,” holds true. When the index is in ‘Extreme Fear,’ it might present opportunities to accumulate assets at lower prices. Conversely, when it’s in ‘Extreme Greed,’ it could be a good time to consider taking some profits or reducing exposure. Emotional Discipline: The index serves as a reminder to check your own emotions. If the market is in ‘Extreme Greed’ and you feel the urge to FOMO into a pump, the index can be a useful prompt to pause and re-evaluate your decision rationally. Combine with Other Indicators: Never rely solely on one indicator. Pair the Fear & Greed Index with technical analysis (chart patterns, moving averages), fundamental analysis (project utility, team, tokenomics), and on-chain metrics for a more robust investment thesis. Risk Management: Use the index to inform your risk management strategy. In periods of high greed, consider tightening stop-losses or reducing position sizes. During fear, you might scale into positions gradually. Potential Pitfalls and Limitations of the Index While invaluable, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t without its limitations: Lagging Indicator: It reflects current or recent sentiment, rather than predicting future price movements. The market can shift rapidly. Bitcoin-Centric: Although it considers other factors, Bitcoin’s dominance and volatility play a significant role. This means it might not always perfectly reflect the sentiment for individual altcoins. Paused Surveys: The temporary absence of the ‘Surveys’ component means one aspect of direct investor sentiment is missing, potentially altering its accuracy slightly. Simplistic View: While comprehensive in its factors, the index distills complex market dynamics into a single number, which can sometimes oversimplify nuanced situations. Always remember that the index is a guide, not a definitive oracle. It should be part of a broader, well-rounded analytical approach. Conclusion: Mastering Your Crypto Journey with Informed Sentiment Analysis The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is an indispensable tool for anyone navigating the dynamic world of digital assets. Its current reading of 64, indicating ‘Greed,’ offers a glimpse into prevailing crypto market sentiment . While it suggests optimism, it also serves as a subtle reminder to remain vigilant. By understanding the underlying factors like Bitcoin dominance , managing the inherent market volatility , and staying abreast of broader cryptocurrency trends , you can use this index to temper your emotions, identify potential opportunities, and mitigate risks. Ultimately, the most successful investors are those who combine data-driven insights with emotional discipline, making informed decisions rather than reactive ones. Use the index as your compass, but chart your own course with careful research and strategic planning.

2025-07-01T12:33:04,"Germany’s Deutsche Bank targets 2026 launch for crypto custody services","Global banking institutions are stepping deeper into crypto, and among them, Germany’s Deutsche Bank is laying out timelines for launching its new services. According to a Tuesday Bloomberg report , the Frankfurt-based institution is gearing up to launch its crypto custody service in 2026. Citing people familiar with the matter, the report stated that Deutsche Bank is working with Bitpanda Technology Solutions, the tech arm of crypto exchange Bitpanda, to build the service. Deutsche Bank’s crypto initiative was first unveiled in 2022 and has gained traction as more global banks explore ways to offer regulated access to crypto and other digital assets. The bank is also reportedly exploring additional blockchain-related efforts, including stablecoin ventures and potential infrastructure for public blockchain use cases that meet regulatory requirements.

In a separate report on June 30, Bloomberg revealed that German bank Sparkassen will also roll out cryptocurrency trading for retail customers by summer 2026. The initiative marks a U-turn from its 2023 decision to block such services, when Sparkassen’s internal committee dismissed crypto as too volatile, risky, and unsuitable for its portfolio. The new offering will allow customers to buy and sell digital assets like Bitcoin Bitcoin through DekaBank, Sparkassen’s securities arm, using their existing banking apps.

2025-07-01T12:30:31,"Crypto Tax Break: Crucial Relief on the Horizon with Lummis’s Bold Bill","BitcoinWorld Crypto Tax Break: Crucial Relief on the Horizon with Lummis’s Bold Bill Are you tired of navigating the complexities of crypto taxes for every small transaction? Imagine a world where buying a coffee with Bitcoin or making a minor NFT trade doesn’t trigger a tax nightmare. Well, that world might be closer than you think, thanks to a bold move by U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis. She’s championing a significant crypto tax break that could redefine how everyday crypto users interact with their digital assets. This isn’t just a whisper in the halls of power; it’s a concrete proposal aimed at easing the burden on crypto enthusiasts and fostering broader adoption. Let’s dive into the details of this potentially game-changing initiative and what it means for the future of your digital wealth. Understanding the Proposed Crypto Tax Break: What’s on the Table? At the heart of Senator Lummis’s push is a straightforward, yet impactful, proposal: an exemption for taxes on small cryptocurrency transactions. Specifically, the provision aims to eliminate taxes on crypto transactions under $300. But wait, there’s more! This isn’t just a one-off deal; it also includes a generous yearly limit of up to $5,000 for these tax-free micro-transactions. This crypto tax break is designed to make using digital currencies for everyday purchases and small trades much more practical and less burdensome. Think about it: no more tracking every tiny gain or loss for tax purposes, simplifying your crypto experience significantly. This kind of legislative foresight could genuinely unlock new avenues for crypto utility beyond just investment. The current tax landscape often discourages the use of cryptocurrencies for minor purchases due to the capital gains tax implications on even small appreciation. This proposed exemption directly addresses that friction, aligning with the spirit of decentralization and accessibility that underpins the crypto movement. It’s a move that could empower users to spend and interact with their digital assets more freely, fostering a more dynamic and liquid crypto economy. Senator Lummis’s Vision: Championing Cryptocurrency Tax Exemption Senator Cynthia Lummis has long been a vocal advocate for the cryptocurrency space, earning a reputation as one of the most crypto-friendly lawmakers in Washington. Her dedication to fostering innovation while ensuring regulatory clarity has made her a key figure in shaping the future of digital assets in the U.S. This latest push for a cryptocurrency tax exemption is a testament to her commitment to integrating crypto into the mainstream financial system in a practical, user-friendly manner. Lummis understands that for cryptocurrencies to truly flourish as a medium of exchange, the tax treatment must evolve. Her vision extends beyond just investment vehicles; she sees digital assets as a tool for financial freedom and technological advancement. By pushing for this exemption, she aims to: Reduce Friction: Make everyday crypto transactions seamless. Encourage Adoption: Incentivize more people to use crypto for payments. Foster Innovation: Create a more conducive environment for crypto-based businesses. Provide Relief: Alleviate the compliance burden on individual users. Her consistent advocacy underscores a broader understanding that the current tax framework, designed for traditional assets, often stifles the unique characteristics and potential of cryptocurrencies. This proposed exemption is a significant step towards a more tailored and sensible regulatory approach. The ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’: The Legislative Vehicle The proposed cryptocurrency tax exemption isn’t being introduced in isolation; it’s slated for inclusion in a broader legislative package known as the ‘ One Big Beautiful Bill Act .’ This legislation, introduced by Texas Republican Representative Jodey Arrington, is a strategic move designed to implement President Donald Trump’s fiscal and tax policy agenda. The choice of vehicle is significant: it’s being pursued via the budget reconciliation process. What does ‘budget reconciliation’ mean, and why is it important here? It’s a special legislative process in the U.S. Congress that allows certain budget-related bills to pass with a simple majority in the Senate (51 votes), rather than the typical 60-vote threshold required for most legislation. This makes it a powerful tool for the majority party to push through key policy initiatives, especially those related to spending, revenues, and the federal debt limit, without facing a filibuster. Including the crypto tax provision in such a bill suggests a concerted effort to give it a stronger chance of passage, leveraging a larger legislative vehicle that carries significant political weight. The ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’ serves as a comprehensive framework, and the inclusion of the crypto tax break within it highlights the growing recognition of digital assets within broader economic policy discussions. It signals that crypto is no longer a niche topic but a legitimate component of the national financial discourse. Impact of Cryptocurrency Tax Exemption on Everyday Users: A Game Changer? If this cryptocurrency tax exemption passes, it could be a monumental shift for millions of crypto users across the United States. Imagine being able to use your crypto for small purchases without the constant worry of tracking every single transaction for capital gains or losses. This would dramatically simplify the user experience and encourage the practical application of digital currencies in daily life. Here’s how it could impact you: Reduced Administrative Burden: No more tedious record-keeping for small transactions. Increased Utility: Encourages using crypto for everyday spending, not just holding as an investment. Lower Barriers to Entry: Makes crypto more approachable for newcomers who might be intimidated by tax complexities. Innovation in Payments: Could spur the development of more crypto-based payment solutions and services. While the benefits are clear, it’s also important to acknowledge potential challenges. The legislative process is often unpredictable, and even with the reconciliation pathway, passage is not guaranteed. Lobbying efforts, political disagreements, and the sheer breadth of the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’ could all influence the fate of this specific provision. However, the mere fact that it’s being seriously considered at this level is a significant win for the crypto community, signaling a growing understanding and acceptance of digital assets within the highest echelons of government. Navigating US Crypto Legislation: What’s Next for Digital Assets? The push for a US crypto legislation that includes a tax exemption for small transactions is part of a much larger, ongoing conversation about how the United States will regulate digital assets. Lawmakers are grappling with a wide array of issues, from stablecoin regulation and exchange oversight to central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and broader consumer protection frameworks. Senator Lummis’s initiative is a beacon of progress in a landscape often characterized by regulatory uncertainty and fragmentation. What’s next for digital assets in the U.S.? Continued Legislative Debates: Expect more bills and proposals addressing various aspects of crypto. Regulatory Clarity: The industry is pushing for clear rules of the road from agencies like the SEC and CFTC. Global Coordination: The U.S. will likely continue to engage with international bodies on crypto regulation. Technological Evolution: As crypto evolves, so too will the regulatory challenges and opportunities. This proposed tax break is a crucial step towards creating a more favorable environment for crypto innovation and adoption. It reflects a growing understanding among policymakers that digital assets are here to stay and require thoughtful, tailored regulation rather than simply fitting them into outdated frameworks. The journey towards comprehensive and effective US crypto legislation is long, but initiatives like Senator Lummis’s provide significant momentum and hope for a brighter, more accessible future for digital currencies. A Future of Financial Freedom? Senator Cynthia Lummis’s tireless efforts to secure a crypto tax break within the ‘ One Big Beautiful Bill Act ‘ represent a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency community. This proposed cryptocurrency tax exemption , targeting transactions under $300 with a $5,000 yearly limit, has the potential to dramatically simplify the use of digital assets for everyday purposes, reducing administrative burdens and fostering broader adoption. As the conversation around US crypto legislation continues to evolve, this initiative stands out as a clear signal that policymakers are beginning to grasp the unique needs and immense potential of the digital economy. While the path to enactment is fraught with political complexities, the very existence of such a proposal offers a compelling vision of a future where engaging with crypto is as seamless and tax-friendly as traditional cash transactions. It’s a bold step towards integrating digital currencies into the fabric of American financial life, promising a future of greater financial freedom and innovation for all.

2025-07-01T12:30:26,"Crypto kicks off rocky H2 2025 as political tension, Musk-Trump rift hammer markets","The crypto market in the second half of 2025 has opened with declines, against the backdrop of political differences in the Middle East and the US. On July 1, the total altcoin market cap dropped below $1.30 trillion, falling to $1.29 trillion according to CoinGecko. The broader market shed 2.51% in value over the same 24-hour period, lowering the global crypto market cap to $3.41 trillion. Altcoins have been underperforming significantly against Bitcoin, recording weeks of sustained weak movements in their technical setup. Altcoin market suffers in mid-2025 According to MN Capital founder and YouTuber Michael Van de Poppe, altcoins are in their deepest slump against Bitcoin in over two years. Last weekend, he shared a chart on X that showed the last comparable bottom formations occurred in June 2022 and June 2023, both of which marked significant lows in Ethereum and other altcoin valuations. Amazing representation of the #Altcoin market. Right now, the #Altcoins are the heaviest underperforming vs. Bitcoin for the past 2 years.

Historically, this percentage has hovered around 60-80% during typical altcoin seasons, but current metrics are one of the worst on record. Major altcoins have shown little sign of reversing course towards the upper side, with Ethereum, XRP, and Solana all facing technical barriers. Ethereum is currently trading just under the $2,500 mark, showing constrained movement and low volatility. ETH has encountered multiple obstacles after recovering from a Fibonacci support range between $2,100 and $2,200. After a failed rally at its 200- and 500-day moving averages, Solana is now retesting a support zone between $143 and $149. Its prior golden cross helped sustain a small uptrend, but the next few sessions will determine if the token rebounds toward the $300 mark or drops toward $132 or lower. Musk and Trump go blow for blow over the big beautiful bill The crypto market slump comes amid the “second round” of political disputes between President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. After the two most-watched American personalities went neck and neck on social media at the start of June, they are back at it again. In the early hours of Tuesday, Musk bashed senators who voted in favor of Trump’s tax and spending “big, beautiful bill, ” saying “they should hang their heads in shame.” “And they will lose their primary next year if it’s the last thing I do on this Earth.” Musk stated on X, threatening to publish posters labeling them “liars” and accusing them of raising US debt by $5 trillion. President Trump hit back on Truth Social shortly, propounding that Musk had received more subsidies than any individual in US government history. “ Without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa ,” Trump stated . “ No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE. ” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-07-01T12:24:45,"Why Is Trump-Linked Bitcoin Mining Firm Moving to Dubai?","The post Why Is Trump-Linked Bitcoin Mining Firm Moving to Dubai? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Hut 8, one of North America’s top Bitcoin mining firms, is making a big move , and it’s headed straight to Dubai. The company, recently in the spotlight for its ties to Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, has just registered a new office in the heart of Dubai’s financial district. This is a sign of where the crypto world is going next – toward global hubs with fewer restrictions and more room to grow. Interesting trend to follow – read on! Hut 8 Heads to the Gulf Hut 8’s new base is set up inside the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), one of the region’s key zones for finance and digital assets. The Dubai team will focus on digital asset trading and treasury management, according to Bloomberg, which confirmed the company is actively hiring in the region. CEO Asher Genoot says the move will help “enhance the precision and efficiency of Hut 8’s capital strategy.” It’s a clear shift for the mining giant, which already operates sites across Texas, New York, and Canada. Now, it’s looking outward toward markets with deeper liquidity and fewer regulatory roadblocks. A Trump family-linked Bitcoin miner plans to set up an office in Dubai, a growing hub for the crypto industry known for its friendly approach to taxation and regulation. https://t.co/eIkKLP8yPu — Bloomberg (@business) June 30, 2025 Dubai’s Crypto Appeal Keeps Growing Dubai’s rise as a crypto destination isn’t new. The city offers zero corporate tax in its free zones, a friendly regulatory environment , and a reputation as a growing financial hub. It’s becoming the go-to spot for crypto firms trying to stay ahead while the U.S. and Europe clamp down. Hut 8’s expansion fits into that trend. The company is clearly looking to diversify its footprint and stay competitive as the market shifts. [post_titles_links postid=”477266″] The Trump Connection Hut 8’s name has been making headlines lately due to its link with American Bitcoin Corp., a mining venture backed in part by Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump. That venture is set to go public later this year and will take over most of Hut 8’s mining operations. Hut 8 will keep an 80% stake and leadership control, while American Data Centers, which is tied to the Trump family, will hold the remaining 20%. Still, this Dubai expansion is a separate initiative, not part of the Trump-backed venture. It’s Hut 8’s own move. A Bigger Shift in Motion The story extends beyond Hut 8. It’s part of a larger move we’re seeing across the crypto space: firms are looking for regulatory clarity, global liquidity, and places where they can actually operate without constant friction. For now, that place is Dubai. When will USA step up in a huge way?

Dubai attracts crypto firms due to its business-friendly environment, which includes zero corporate tax in its free zones, a clear and welcoming regulatory framework, and its strategic position as a growing global financial hub. This combination offers greater operational freedom and liquidity compared to other regions. How will Hut 8’s move to Dubai impact its global expansion strategy? Hut 8’s move to Dubai will significantly enhance its global expansion strategy by diversifying its operational footprint beyond North America. The Dubai office, focusing on digital asset trading and treasury management, will allow Hut 8 to access deeper liquidity and navigate fewer regulatory roadblocks, aiming to boost its capital efficiency. When might US regulations catch up with Dubai’s crypto-friendly environment? The article implies that the U.S. has been “clamping down” on crypto, pushing firms to more crypto-friendly environments like Dubai. While the exact timing for the U.S. to catch up is uncertain, the move highlights a growing divergence, suggesting a significant shift in U.S. regulatory policy would be needed to attract back such firms.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-is-trump-linked-bitcoin-mining-firm-moving-to-dubai/,"MINING|BTC|REGULATION|MARKET|TRADING|ALTCOIN","News|Mining",cryptocompare

2025-07-01T12:20:27,"Crypto Scam: Europol’s Massive $540M Bust Shakes Global Fraud Network","BitcoinWorld Crypto Scam: Europol’s Massive $540M Bust Shakes Global Fraud Network The digital world, while offering unprecedented opportunities, also harbors dark corners where deception thrives. A recent, staggering announcement from Europol has sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency community, revealing the dismantling of a massive crypto scam operation that plundered over half a billion dollars from unsuspecting individuals globally. This audacious Europol bust is a stark reminder of the persistent threats lurking in the digital finance landscape and the relentless efforts of law enforcement to combat them. Unpacking the Global Investment Fraud : How Did It Operate? This wasn’t a small-time operation. Europol, in collaboration with Spanish authorities, meticulously unraveled a sophisticated global investment fraud network that spanned continents. Imagine a web of deceit, meticulously spun to ensnare over 5,000 victims, collectively losing an astounding $540 million. The sheer scale of this crypto scam is breathtaking, highlighting the cunning and reach of modern digital criminals. How did they achieve such a massive scale? The network primarily leveraged elaborate fake investment schemes , promising astronomical returns on crypto investments that simply didn’t exist. Victims were often lured through social media, dating apps, or seemingly legitimate online advertisements, funneling their hard-earned money into what they believed were high-yield crypto portfolios. Once funds were acquired, the fraudsters employed complex money laundering techniques, utilizing various crypto exchanges and a labyrinth of Hong Kong-based shell companies to obscure the illicit origins of the funds. This sophisticated approach made tracing the money incredibly challenging, underscoring the complexities involved in combating global crypto crime . The Deceptive Allure of High-Yield Crypto Crime : What Were the Red Flags? The core of this operation, like many others, relied on enticing victims with promises of easy wealth through high-yield crypto crime . These fraudulent schemes often share common characteristics that, in hindsight, serve as crucial red flags for potential investors. Understanding these tactics is key to protecting yourself from becoming a victim of investment fraud . Common Tactics Used by Crypto Scammers: Guaranteed High Returns: Promises of unrealistic, risk-free profits (e.g., “double your Bitcoin in a week”). Legitimate investments always carry inherent risks, and guaranteed returns are a major red flag. Impersonation: Scammers often impersonate legitimate financial advisors, well-known crypto figures, celebrities, or even government officials to build trust and credibility. Pressure Tactics: Urgency to invest quickly, fear of missing out (FOMO), and constant pressure to deposit more funds or recruit new investors. Fake Platforms: Creation of professional-looking websites and apps that mimic real trading platforms but are entirely fraudulent. These platforms often show fake profits to encourage more deposits. Complex Jargon: Overuse of technical crypto terms and financial jargon to confuse victims and appear knowledgeable, making it difficult for victims to question their claims. Personalized Attention: Scammers often build a personal relationship with victims, sometimes for months, through messaging apps, making the deception more convincing. These schemes prey on a combination of financial aspirations and a lack of deep understanding of cryptocurrency mechanics. The fraudsters often build a relationship with their victims, sometimes for months, before extracting significant sums. Europol’s Strategic Bust : A Victory for Victim Protection The success of this operation underscores the growing international cooperation in combating digital financial crime. The Europol bust culminated in the arrest of five key suspects in Spain, effectively dismantling a significant portion of this nefarious network. This collaborative effort demonstrates a robust commitment to victim protection in the digital age, showcasing that law enforcement agencies are adapting and enhancing their capabilities to pursue these digital criminals across borders. “This operation highlights the global nature of modern crime and the necessity for international law enforcement to work together,” stated a Europol spokesperson. “Our aim is not just to arrest criminals, but to safeguard potential victims and recover stolen assets wherever possible.” While recovering all $540 million remains a monumental challenge due to the nature of crypto transactions and complex money laundering techniques, the arrests send a powerful message: no matter how sophisticated the crypto scam , justice will pursue those responsible. Bolstering Your Defenses Against Digital Investment Fraud : Actionable Insights In an era where crypto crime is increasingly sophisticated, safeguarding your financial security is paramount. This Europol operation serves as a critical learning experience for every crypto enthusiast and investor. Taking proactive steps can significantly reduce your risk of falling prey to investment fraud and contribute to broader victim protection efforts within the community. How to Protect Yourself from Crypto Scams: Actionable Insight Description Do Your Due Diligence Always research any investment opportunity thoroughly. Verify the company, its team, and its claims independently. Check official registries, reputable crypto news sources, and review sites. Be Skeptical of High Returns If an offer seems too good to be true, it almost certainly is. Legitimate investments come with risks and realistic return expectations. Be wary of promises of guaranteed profits. Protect Your Private Keys Never share your wallet’s private keys or seed phrase with anyone. Scammers often trick users into revealing this critical information, which grants them full access to your funds. Use Reputable Exchanges Only use well-established, regulated cryptocurrency exchanges with strong security protocols, multi-factor authentication, and a proven track record of security. Beware of Unsolicited Offers Be extremely cautious of unsolicited messages, emails, or calls promising investment opportunities. Verify the sender’s identity through official channels before engaging. Report Suspicious Activity If you encounter a suspected scam, report it immediately to your local law enforcement, national cybersecurity agencies, and the relevant crypto platforms. Your report can help protect others. The fight against crypto fraud requires collective vigilance. Education is your strongest shield against these predatory schemes, and sharing knowledge about common scam tactics is a vital part of community-wide victim protection . The recent Europol bust of the $540 million crypto scam is a monumental victory in the ongoing battle against digital financial crime. It highlights the pervasive nature of sophisticated investment fraud and the urgent need for robust victim protection mechanisms. As the crypto landscape evolves, so too do the tactics of fraudsters. By understanding the common pitfalls and adopting proactive measures, individuals can significantly enhance their financial security and contribute to a safer digital economy. This operation serves as a powerful testament to the fact that while crypto crime may be global, so is the resolve to combat it, bringing hope and greater security to the crypto space.

The majority of that figure can be attributed to two incidents; the Bybit breach and the Cetus Protocol exploit that combined were worth $1.78 billion. Wallet compromise was the key attack vectors for hackers in the first half of this year, contributing to $1.7 billion worth of losses, while phishing was still rampant resulting in $410 million stolen across 132 incidents. Phishing is a technique hackers use to steal a victim's password or credentials in order to access an account. “While the overall figures are alarming, it is important to point out that the majority of the funds lost in H1 were attributable to two concentrated, high-impact events,” said CertiK co-founder Ronghui Gu. “But regardless, the results serve as another reminder to the industry that there is still much work to be done,” Gu added. The report also found that $801 million was lost in Q2 alone, a 52% decrease from the previous quarter.

2025-07-01T12:11:24,"Dollar Index Suffers Worst Crash Since 1991; Bitcoin's 'Stochastic' Points to Possible Drop Below $100K: Technical Analysis","This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. The dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback's value against major fiat currencies, looks south, having taken a beating in the first half. Still, bitcoin's (BTC) chart points to immediate downside risks. The DXY fell over 10% in the first half, its worst six-month performance since the third quarter of 1991, according to data source TradingView. U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war and constant calls for Fed rate cuts supposedly weighed on the greenback. The sharp slide has breached the 14-year-long ascending trendline, pushing the MACD histogram below zero on the half-yearly price chart. The trendline breakdown, coupled with the negative MACD, suggests a strengthening of bearish momentum and points to further losses ahead. ""Looks like USD could drop another 10% easily....and maybe a lot more in the next 12-24 months,"" Dan Tapiero, founder and CEO of DTAP Capital, said on X , calling it a bullish tailwind for bitcoin. BTC faces sell-off risks Bitcoin's short-term technicals, particularly the ongoing price action relative to the stochastic indicator, paint a bleak picture. BTC fell 1% on Monday, turning lower from the upper end of the bull flag countertrend consolidation carved out over the past six weeks. In such conditions, traders typically use oscillators, such as the stochastic, to confirm whether the rejection at the upper boundary of the ongoing consolidation has set the stage for a renewed slide to the lower end. In BTC's case, the 14-day stochastic confirms the same, repeating the pattern seen in the first half of June. The oscillator is on the verge of crossing below 80, marking a downturn from the overbought region to suggest renewed sell-off within the broad price range. In other words, BTC could revisit sub-$100,000 in the short term. A firm move above the upper end of the consolidation will invalidate the bearish signal, setting the stage for a rally to $140,000.

The legislation, known as H.B. 7082, passed unanimously through both the state House of Representatives and Senate without a single opposing vote. Source: cga.ct.gov The new law explicitly bars Connecticut and its political subdivisions from accepting virtual currency as payment or establishing any form of digital asset reserve . This positions Connecticut as one of the most restrictive states regarding cryptocurrency adoption, contrasting sharply with the growing trend of Bitcoin reserve legislation across the United States. The timing appears particularly significant, as 26 states have introduced 47 Bitcoin reserve bills, with Texas, New Hampshire, and Arizona already having approved state-level Bitcoin reserve frameworks. Connecticut’s decision effectively removes it from the national conversation around strategic crypto adoption for public treasuries. The legislation extends beyond investment restrictions to comprehensive regulations governing the transmission of money. Crypto businesses must now provide extensive disclosures about material risks, including warnings about fraud potential, market volatility, and the irreversible nature of transactions. Additional protections require parental verification for users under 18 years old. NEW: Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont officially signed into law the state's 'Bitcoin Reserve Ban' today. Connecticut is now prohibited from accepting, holding, or investing in digital assets. https://t.co/vIXIkprdHI — Bitcoin Laws (@Bitcoin_Laws) July 1, 2025 States Rally Around Bitcoin Adoption Despite Federal Uncertainty Crypto adoption at the state level is aggressively growing and starkly contrasts with this new Connecticut move. Texas leads the movement with Governor Greg Abbott signing Senate Bill 21 , establishing America’s first state-funded Bitcoin reserve entirely separate from the state treasury. Texas has officially joined the small but growing list of U.S. states moving toward on-chain finance, passing a bill that protects Bitcoin reserves. #Texas #Bitcoin https://t.co/kBh6nFgROs — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 22, 2025 Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar will oversee the fund, with companion legislation HB 4488 protecting reserves from routine fund reallocations. Senator Charles Schwertner led the initiative, arguing, “ the state of Texas should have the option of evaluating the best performing asset over the last 10 years. “ New Hampshire also achieved a historic milestone by becoming the first state to pass laws allowing public funds to be invested in Bitcoin reserves . Governor Kelly Ayotte signed legislation permitting up to a 5% allocation in digital assets with a market capitalization exceeding $500 billion, effectively targeting Bitcoin exclusively. California is also not left out with its progressive adoption through Assembly Bill 1180 , which unanimously passed with 78 Assembly Members supporting pilot programs for digital asset fee payments. The Department of Financial Protection and Innovation will create frameworks for cryptocurrency-based government transactions by 2025. Arizona, however, presents a complex picture, with Governor Katie Hobbs vetoing comprehensive Bitcoin reserve legislation while simultaneously signing HB 2749, which creates frameworks for managing unclaimed digital assets. The state maintains multiple active bills, including revised HB2324, which recently passed Senate reconsideration. Corporate adoption accelerates regardless of state-level policies, with 252 entities now holding Bitcoin, representing approximately 16.57% of the total supply. Source: BitcoinTreasuries Strategy maintains the largest position at 597,325 BTC worth $63.93 billion, with the most recent purchase being 4,980 Bitcoin for $531.1 million, at an average price of approximately $106,801 per bitcoin. Source: SaylorTracker Regulatory Patchwork Creates Compliance Challenges Notably, the new Connecticut law mandates extensive compliance measures, including customer identification protocols, transaction receipt requirements, and robust risk disclosure frameworks that exceed federal minimums. Money transmission licensees must maintain virtual currency holdings equal to customer obligations while prohibiting unauthorized use of controlled assets. The legislation establishes that virtual currency held by licensees becomes property interests of claimants, creating additional legal protections for consumers. Several states have abandoned their efforts to reserve Bitcoin, creating an inconsistent national landscape. Florida withdrew House Bill 487 and Senate Bill 550 during legislative sessions, joining Wyoming , South Dakota, North Dakota , Pennsylvania, Montana, and Oklahoma in failed adoption attempts. Positively, some other states are still in the process. For instance, Michigan introduced House Bill 4087 , which allows for a 10% treasury allocation to cryptocurrencies. The Michigan House Bill was introduced by Representatives Bryan Posthumus and Ron Robinson to push for a strategic Bitcoin reserve. #BitcoinReserve #Michigan https://t.co/fXJSPOQ6gs — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 14, 2025 At the same time, Ohio advanced Senate Bill 57 , which creates exclusive Bitcoin reserve funds with mandatory five-year holding periods. Similarly, North Carolina also passed legislation permitting a 5% investment allocation pending validation by third-party oversight. Additionally, West Virginia’s Inflation Protection Act proposes a 10% treasury allocation to digital assets with a market capitalization exceeding $750 billion, effectively limiting investments to Bitcoin and select stablecoins. The legislation positions precious metals and cryptocurrencies as inflation hedges against government spending deficits. Oklahoma has also approved the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act through the House Committee with a 12-2 vote, allowing for a 10% public fund allocation to digital assets that meet market capitalization thresholds.

2025-07-01T12:10:24,"Levelpath Secures $55M: A Game-Changing Leap for AI Procurement","BitcoinWorld Levelpath Secures $55M: A Game-Changing Leap for AI Procurement In a world where digital transformation is paramount, the recent infusion of $55 million in Series B funding into Levelpath, a next-generation procurement software startup, marks a significant milestone. For those keenly observing the intersection of technology and finance, particularly within the dynamic cryptocurrency space, this investment underscores the immense value placed on innovative solutions that promise efficiency and substantial returns. Just as blockchain revolutionizes financial transactions, Levelpath is poised to redefine enterprise spending, leveraging cutting-edge artificial intelligence to streamline a traditionally cumbersome process. What is Levelpath and Why is it Making Waves? Levelpath is not just another software company; it is the brainchild of Stan Garber and Alex Yakubovich, the visionary duo behind Scout RFP, which was acquired by Workday for a substantial $540 million in 2019. Their experience at Workday exposed them to persistent procurement challenges, inspiring them to build Levelpath as a mobile-first, user-friendly platform designed to address these pain points head-on. The timing of Levelpath’s launch was fortuitous, coinciding with the debut of ChatGPT. This allowed the startup to integrate advanced AI procurement capabilities from its inception. This includes: Reviewing unstructured data: AI can quickly analyze complex contracts. Recommending cost-effective alternatives: The platform suggests less expensive, similar products and services. Enhancing user experience: Making procurement enjoyable rather than a chore. With a goal to quadruple its revenue this year, Levelpath is quickly gaining traction, counting industry giants like Ace Hardware, Amgen, Coupang, and SiriusXM among its growing customer base. This rapid adoption highlights the market’s hunger for more efficient and intelligent procurement solutions. The Power of AI in Procurement Software: A Game Changer? The integration of artificial intelligence is what truly sets Levelpath apart in the competitive procurement software landscape. Traditional procurement systems are often clunky and outdated, leading employees to bypass official processes. This ‘rogue’ spending, frequently done via corporate credit cards, results in significant overspending and missed opportunities for bulk discounts. Levelpath’s AI capabilities directly tackle these inefficiencies. By automating the analysis of complex data and intelligently recommending optimized purchasing decisions, companies can realize substantial savings. As Battery Ventures general partner Neeraj Agarwal points out, procurement represents companies’ second-largest expenditure after payroll, making software improvements in this area incredibly valuable. The ability of AI procurement to make the ‘cash register ring’ through these savings is a compelling proposition for any business looking to optimize its financial health. Navigating the Enterprise Software Landscape: Challenges and Opportunities The enterprise software market, particularly in procurement, has long been dominated by legacy players such as Coupa and Ariba. While these companies have been stalwarts, their systems often lack the agility and user-friendliness demanded by today’s fast-paced business environment. This creates a significant opportunity for agile, innovative startups like Levelpath to disrupt the status quo. The procurement software market was valued at a substantial $7.3 billion annually in 2023 , according to Fortune Business Insights. Despite being a newer entrant compared to competitors like Zip (valued at $2.2 billion last fall) and Oro Labs (backed by Felicis), Levelpath possesses unique ingredients for success, including its experienced founders and strategic investor support. Here is a brief overview of key players in the modern procurement space: Company Valuation/Funding (Recent) Key Differentiator Levelpath $55M Series B Mobile-first, AI-native, user-friendly procurement Zip $2.2 Billion (last fall) Intake-to-procure platform Oro Labs Backed by Felicis Focus on AI-powered sourcing and procurement Coupa Acquired for $8 Billion (2024) Legacy cloud-based business spend management Strategic Investment: What Does This Funding Mean? The recent Levelpath funding round, a significant $55 million Series B , was led by Battery Ventures, with continued participation from existing investors like Benchmark and Redpoint. This substantial capital injection is a clear signal of confidence in Levelpath’s rapid growth trajectory and its potential to revolutionize the procurement industry. Neeraj Agarwal, who notably led Battery’s Series B investment into Coupa (which had a successful IPO in 2016 and was later taken private for $8 billion), has joined Levelpath’s board. His extensive experience in this category lends immense credibility to Levelpath’s prospects. Agarwal expressed his profound impression of Levelpath’s technology and its founders, stating, “They have such a strong reputation for delivering product, being good people to work with, and doing what they say they’re going to do. Customers want to work with them and help them build this next-generation product,” as he shared with Bitcoin World. This strategic startup investment is not just about capital; it is about bringing seasoned expertise and a proven track record to accelerate Levelpath’s market penetration and product development. The founders’ long-standing partnership, stemming from their high school days and shared entrepreneurial spirit, further strengthens the company’s foundation. Redefining Procurement: A New Era of Efficiency Levelpath’s founders, Stan Garber and Alex Yakubovich, share a common goal: to make using procurement software an enjoyable experience rather than a dreaded task. Their mobile-first, intuitive platform is designed to overcome the friction points that drive employees away from official processes, ensuring compliance and maximizing savings. The benefits of an optimized procurement software system are direct and significant. By enabling companies to spend smarter, identify bulk discount opportunities, and curb ‘rogue’ spending, Levelpath offers a tangible return on investment. This new era of efficiency, powered by advanced AI, promises to transform a historically mundane business function into a strategic advantage. Levelpath’s successful $55 million Series B funding round is more than just a financial milestone; it is a powerful validation of its innovative approach to procurement. By combining a user-centric design with cutting-edge AI capabilities, Levelpath is poised to disrupt a multi-billion dollar market dominated by legacy systems. With seasoned founders, strategic investors, and a clear vision for the future, Levelpath is not just building software; it is crafting a future where procurement is efficient, intelligent, and even enjoyable. This investment signals a bright future for businesses seeking to optimize their spending and enhance operational efficiency through advanced technology.

And with everything running on-chain, it marks a significant step forward for both the stock and crypto markets. As Robinhood leads the charge, assets like Best Wallet Token ($BEST) are positioned to play a key role in enhancing how we store and manage these innovative on-chain assets. Robinhood’s Impact on Crypto and Stock Trading Robinhood is taking its democratizing approach to the next level by launching over 200 US stock and ETF tokens for European customers. Starting on June 30, 2025, this expansion allows users in 30 EU and EEA countries to gain exposure to major US equities, including Nasdaq and S&P 500 companies, directly from the Robinhood app. The newly launched stock tokens come with zero commissions and dividend support, offering users a seamless and rewarding trading experience. What sets this move apart is Robinhood’s deep integration of blockchain technology. The tokens will initially launch on Arbitrum, with plans to migrate to Robinhood’s own Layer 2 blockchain, purpose-built for tokenizing real-world assets. By removing the delays common in traditional stock transactions, this innovation enables faster, more transparent trades and paves the way for a more efficient, on-chain financial system. With this bold step, Robinhood is bridging the gap between equities and crypto, placing itself at the leading edge of a financial revolution where legacy finance and blockchain work hand in hand. What is Best Wallet Token ($BEST)? Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is a new breed of cryptocurrency designed to enhance the user experience in the crypto space. It’s closely tied to the Best Wallet ecosystem, a next-generation wallet that challenges legacy wallets like MetaMask by offering advanced features within an easy-to-use interface. $BEST plays a crucial role within the platform, providing token holders with exclusive benefits. For instance, users can enjoy reduced transaction fees, early access to new crypto projects , and higher staking rewards. One standout feature is the ‘Upcoming Tokens’ tool, which allows presale buyers to participate in crypto presales directly within the app, eliminating the risks associated with scam sites. The $BEST token also delivers real utility in the iGaming space, granting holders perks like free spins, exclusive lootbox access, and deposit bonuses, adding real-world value to its digital footprint. Backed by a rapidly expanding user base and strong community momentum, Best Wallet Token is carving out a leadership role in the competitive crypto wallet market. Thanks to its seamless integration with the broader crypto ecosystem, $BEST is uniquely positioned to grow, especially as platforms like Robinhood accelerate the adoption of tokenized assets and decentralized finance on a global scale. Why Buy $BEST Right Now? Right now, you can buy $BEST for just $0.025265, and the ongoing presale has already raised $13.6M, signaling strong investor confidence. With a price forecast of $0.072 by 2025 , that’s a potential increase of 185% from its current value. If you purchase and stake $BEST now, with an APY of 20%, your staked tokens could grow by 20% each year. For example, if you stake 1K $BEST tokens at the current price, you’d earn 200 additional tokens over the next 12 months. At the projected price of $0.072 in 2025, those 1,200 tokens would be worth $86.40. That’s a potential profit of $36.40. If the price hits $0.62 by 2026, your staked tokens would be worth $744 – this represents a staggering 2,860% return on your initial investment. Don’t miss the opportunity to secure these gains early. Robinhood’s Game-Changing Move and the Future of On-Chain Finance Robinhood’s innovative expansion into the EU with stock tokens, coupled with its integration of blockchain, is a major step forward for both traditional and crypto markets. By offering an easy way to access US equities and introducing new crypto features, Robinhood is helping bridge the gap between these two worlds. As more platforms follow suit, the adoption of on-chain finance could be set for a massive surge. And for anyone looking to get ahead of the curve, Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is one to watch.

2025-07-01T12:00:58,"Bitcoin Shopping Spree: Strategy Continues Accumulation With $530M Purchase","Strategy (previously MicroStrategy), the leading corporate holder of Bitcoin (BTC), is on the verge of reaching a significant milestone as it approaches the acquisition of 600,000 tokens. In its latest move, the company purchased 4,980 Bitcoin between June 23 and June 29 for an average price of $106,801 each, totaling approximately $531.9 million. This latest purchase has brought the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 597,325, acquired for around $42.4 billion. Strategy Shares Surge 4.7% Despite Bitcoin’s price remaining relatively stable at around $107,000 and $107,500 over the past 24 hours, Strategy’s shares, MSTR, increased by 4.7% to $402.07 on Monday, reflecting investor confidence in the company’s financial moves. The value of Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings now stands at roughly $64 billion. Related Reading: Wave 3 Ignites As XRP Breaks Structure—Analyst Says ‘Fireworks Ahead’ Funding for these latest acquisitions came through the sale of stock under various at-the-market offerings. Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer noted that the company’s Bitcoin yield, which measures the change in the ratio of its Bitcoin holdings to total shares outstanding, was 19.7% between January 1 and June 29. Strategy’s Chairman, Michael Saylor, who is often regarded as one of Bitcoin’s most vocal advocates, hinted at the recent purchase in a social media post over the weekend. He stated, “In 21 years, you’ll wish you’d bought more,” alongside a chart illustrating the performance of Strategy’s Bitcoin portfolio since its initial investment in late 2020, which shows the aggressive purchases that have increased over the past year. Bitcoin Price Hovers Around $107,000 Interestingly, the company had made a smaller purchase of 245 Bitcoins between June 16 and June 22, considerably less than its usual massive acquisitions. For context, Strategy had previously acquired 10,100 Bitcoins in just six days during the period from June 9 to June 15. This shows that while the company often makes large purchases, it can also vary its acquisition strategy based on market conditions. Over the past month, the market’s leading cryptocurrency has seen a notable volatility spike with prices failing to tackle its current record price of $111,800 reached during last month’s rally. Related Reading: Solana Forms Bullish Flag On Daily Chart — Breakout Imminent? Since, Bitcoin has managed to endure subsequent price drops, with the most recent plunging BTC toward the $98,000 zone. However, the cryptocurrency has managed to record a 2.4% recovery on the weekly time frame, currently consolidating at $107,000. Originally founded as an enterprise software firm, Strategy has transformed into a leveraged play on Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrency without directly owning it. Since August 2020, the company has consistently increased its Bitcoin reserves by selling stock and debt. This has prompted criticism from analysts who believe this could be dangerous if the Bitcoin price drops below the firm’s average buying price.

2025-07-01T12:00:10,"According to the Latest Data, These Altcoins Made Their Mark in June!","June, when Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins experienced chaos and slight pullbacks, is behind us. While BTC had a month full of ups and downs between $98,000 and $110,000, the picture is mixed for altcoins. Some altcoins made big gains in terms of market value, trading volume or whale activity in June. At this point, Santiment examined altcoins in its latest report and listed the altcoins that stood out in different categories. In Terms of Market Value! Santiment analysts have ranked the altcoins that have gained the most in market value in the last 30 days, according to current data. Accordingly, Liquid Staked ETH (LSETH) became the biggest market value gainer with an increase of 89.8%. LSETH was followed by Maple Finance (SYRUP) with a 68.7 percent increase, Aerodrome Finance (AERO) with a 64.2 percent increase, Sei (SEI) with a 61.3 percent increase and KAIA with a 55.4 percent increase. In Terms of Trading Volume! A high trading volume usually indicates strong market activity. A low trading volume, on the other hand, indicates weak demand or investor interest. It can make it more likely to sell quickly during price swings. At this point, analysts listed the altcoins that have experienced the biggest increase in trading volume in the last 30 days. Mantle Staked Ether (METH) took first place, making the biggest increase in volume with a huge jump of 1,643.8%. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) came in second with a 751.9% increase, followed by SEI with a 635.9% increase, KAIA with a 397.9% increase and World Liberty Financial USD (USD1) with a 397.2% increase. In Terms of Whale Operations! Large investor whales, whose movements in the market are closely followed by retail investors, can influence the price of the relevant token with their movements. A sudden increase in whale activity could indicate accumulation before a price increase or selling before a drop. At this point, analysts said that GateToken (GT) showed the biggest rise in terms of whale transaction growth of over $100,000 in the last 30 days, jumping 300.0%. GT was followed by SPX6900 (SPX) with a 238% increase, USDC with a 175.7% increase, SKY with a 170.4% increase and DEXE with a 150% increase. June was a month of chaos and mild retracements throughout crypto. But several projects stood out and still saw glorious marketcap rises, whale activity boosts, and social volume surges. We look at the leaders in several key categories in our latest. https://t.co/g0RhbBuEWH — Santiment (@santimentfeed) July 1, 2025 *This is not investment advice.
