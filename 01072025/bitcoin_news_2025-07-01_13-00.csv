2025-07-01T10:50:58,"No Bitcoin for Connecticut: State Bans Investment and Reserves in New Law","The post No Bitcoin for Connecticut: State Bans Investment and Reserves in New Law appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont has signed House Bill 7082 into law, officially regulating the ‚Äú Bitcoin Reserve Ban‚Äù in the state. Now, Connecticut is prohibited from accepting, holding, or investing in digital assets. This marks a contrast from the US trend in the evolution of virtual digital currency. Connecticut Officially Bans Bitcoin Reserve The legislation titled ‚ÄúAn Act Concerning the Prohibition of State Government Entities from Holding or Investing in Cryptocurrencies ‚Äù was initially introduced in response to growing concerns regarding volatilities and uncertainties in digital currencies in February 2025 before finalizing the enactment on June 30. The enactment provides clarity that the state prioritizes risk mitigation and consumer protection over speculative investment. Legislation on the Prohibition of Cryptocurrency Settling the long-standing debate, Connecticut finalizes the ban on cryptocurrency and other virtual currencies to prevent the state from associated risks. The law ensures that Connecticut remains protected from the threats associated with the digital assets market. ‚ÄúNeither the state nor any political subdivision of the state shall (1) accept or require payment in the form of virtual currency for an amount due to the state or the political subdivision, or (2) purchase, hold, invest in or establish a reserve of virtual currency,‚Äù HB 7082 reads . [post_titles_links postid=‚Äù477237‚Ä≥] Key Highlights of Crypto Ban Legislation It introduces comprehensive consumer protection measures, ensuring that businesses engaging in virtual asset transactions disclose potential risks. Provisions aimed at enhancing transparency and security in virtual currency transactions. Crypto businesses must disclose critical risks‚Äì irreversibility of transactions, absence of government insurance, and potential for unrecoverable losses. Introduced new daily transaction limits for virtual currency kiosk ‚Äì $2,000 for new customers and $5,000 for existing ones. Virtual currency kiosk operators face stricter regulations‚Äì provide live customer support and employ a full-time compliance officer to oversee adherence. The enactment sets Connecticut apart from other US states like Texas , Arizona , and New Hampshire , which continue to adopt digital currency reserves. As the bill contrasts with the majority of US states, it has been met with mixed reactions from industry experts and policymakers. Some argue that the bill is crucial for precautions, while others say it stifles innovation in the nation.

Connecticut‚Äôs ban on state entities holding or investing in crypto contrasts sharply with states like Texas, Arizona, and New Hampshire, which are moving to establish digital asset reserves. This highlights a growing divergence in state-level approaches, with Connecticut prioritizing risk aversion while others embrace crypto innovation. What are the potential impacts of Connecticut‚Äôs crypto ban on its digital economy and blockchain innovation? While the ban aims to protect public funds from volatility, critics argue it could stifle innovation within Connecticut‚Äôs digital economy. It might deter blockchain-based startups and investment, potentially causing them to gravitate towards more crypto-friendly states that encourage digital asset development and integration. How might Connecticut‚Äôs legislation influence other states‚Äô cryptocurrency policies? Connecticut‚Äôs cautious approach could influence other risk-averse legislatures to consider similar bans or stricter regulations on state crypto involvement. It adds to the ongoing national debate about crypto‚Äôs role in public finance, potentially encouraging a more conservative stance in states prioritizing financial stability over speculative gains.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/no-bitcoin-for-connecticut-state-bans-investment-and-reserves-in-new-law/,"REGULATION|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|ALTCOIN","News|Bitcoin Reserve",cryptocompare

2025-07-01T10:41:08,"Circle's USDC could soon displace USDT as top liquidity provider for BTC trading pairs","Circle‚Äôs USDC stablecoin is changing the balance of the BTC market. The token is more widely used in liquidity pairs, supporting 25% of the available 1% liquidity depth. The fully regulated stablecoin by Circle is becoming more important for the BTC market. The stablecoin is displacing fiat pairs in terms of activity, while securing a growing part of the 1% market depth. Circle has gained market share in 2025 For the first half of 2025, the share of USDC in securing BTC liquidity rose from around 15% to 24%. The share of USDT remained flat for the first half of the year. Liquidity for USDC-denominated trading pairs is steadily climbing across crypto markets. BTC-USDC now accounts for 24% of total 1% market depth on major exchanges, up from 15% six months ago. üìà üåäüìà pic.twitter.com/yI9bOf5nXo ‚Äî Kaiko (@KaikoData) July 1, 2025 The influence of USDC expanded, as the total supply returned to levels from 2023, erasing the effect of the bear market and lowered demand. The stablecoin currently carries around 10.5% of all BTC trading volume, though the activity metric diverges from the available depth. Volumes for USD pairs account for over 19% of BTC daily volumes, mostly due to Coinbase‚Äôs influence. Trading volumes are also open to brief anomalies or days of record trading, as in the case of USD1 , which briefly surpassed Circle USD in 24-hour trading. USDC expands its influence with growing supply The share of USDT has fallen to around 37% of all volumes, down from its usual levels above 50%. Currently, FDUSD is also highly active, with a 300% daily turnover of its entire supply. FDUSD , however, remains limited to Binance trading pairs. USDC is currently expanding its presence and activity levels, rising to a higher baseline in 2025. USDC achieves $5B to $7B in daily trading, with varying activity in both centralized and decentralized pairs. Currently, USDC is also highly active for swaps against USDT, reflecting demand for fully regulated tokens, the only type that can be used in some regions. The usage of USDT also coincided with the expansion of EURC , the Euro-linked stablecoin minted by Circle. USDC is also spreading to a wider selection of holders. In 2025, almost every month has seen an expansion of wallets holding Circle dollar stablecoin. Most of the Circle-issued USD is held in personal end-user wallets , with around 54K smart contracts supplied with the token. USDC expanded its holders in 2025, with more demand for a regulated stablecoin. | Source: Dune Analytics One of the sources of USDC growth is its usage on Hyperliquid . Nearly 3B Circle USD were deposited on the perpetual futures DEX, becoming a key stablecoin for mostly BTC and ETH pairs. The other source of app activity comes from Polymarket, where USDC supports an active prediction market as the main source of liquidity. The token is also showing expansion of its on-chain activity, mostly on the Ethereum chain. The stablecoin is the fourth most active smart contract on Ethereum in early July, burning up 65 ETH in daily fees. The stablecoin is slowly catching up to Tether, with 100 ETH in daily burned fees. USDC is also expanding on Solana, minting another 250M tokens in the past 24 hours. The supply on Solana peaked above 12B tokens, then shrank again at around 10.5B . Solana activity is expected to pick up ahead of its new ETF launch, boosting demand for stablecoin liquidity. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The move comes as the Gulf city continues to lure digital asset firms with its relaxed tax policies and business-friendly environment. The Miami-based company registered the new office last week with the Dubai International Financial Centre, one of the region‚Äôs key financial zones. Bloomberg confirmed that the firm is actively building a team in the emirate, focused on digital asset trading and treasury management. Dubai Office Part of Broader Global Pivot CEO Asher Genoot said the new base would help ‚Äúenhance the precision and efficiency of Hut 8‚Äôs capital strategy.‚Äù A Trump family-linked Bitcoin miner plans to set up an office in Dubai, a growing hub for the crypto industry known for its friendly approach to taxation and regulation. https://t.co/eIkKLP8yPu ‚Äî Bloomberg (@business) June 30, 2025 The decision to expand into Dubai reflects a broader recalibration within the crypto industry, as firms seek regulatory certainty and access to global liquidity. Hut 8 didn‚Äôt return Cryptonews‚Äô request for comment by press time. Dubai has emerged as a magnet for digital asset players by offering zero corporate taxes in its free zones and a light-touch regulatory regime. Its status as a financial and logistics hub has also made it an attractive destination for miners and crypto-native firms looking to operate across jurisdictions. Hut 8 Eyes Liquidity Abroad Amid Shifting Crypto Regulation Hut 8 already runs Bitcoin mining operations in Texas, New York and Alberta Canada. As of the end of 2024, the company had around 220 employees. While it remains a dominant miner in North America, the new outpost in the Middle East suggests a growing appetite to tap into global capital flows and optimize treasury strategies amid Bitcoin‚Äôs renewed bull run. The company‚Äôs name has recently drawn attention due to its involvement with American Bitcoin Corp. , a new venture backed in part by Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump. That entity is set to go public later this year and will absorb most of Hut 8‚Äôs mining operations. Hut 8 will retain an 80% stake and leadership roles in the merged company, while the Trump-affiliated American Data Centers holds the remaining 20%. Despite these ties, the Dubai office is reportedly not connected to the American Bitcoin venture. Instead, it marks a standalone initiative by Hut 8 to strengthen its presence in one of the world‚Äôs fastest-growing crypto hubs. As digital asset regulation tightens in the US and parts of Europe, Dubai‚Äôs more accommodating stance is becoming a key draw.

2025-07-01T10:14:40,"American Bitcoin Raises $220 Million to Expand Mining Operations and Treasury","American Bitcoin, a majority-owned subsidiary of crypto mining giant Hut 8, has successfully raised $220 million in a private placement aimed at expanding its Bitcoin mining capabilities and bolstering its Bitcoin treasury. The company issued 11 million shares on Friday, generating gross proceeds of $220 million, according to a recent regulatory filing. Interestingly, $10 million worth of these shares were purchased using Bitcoin rather than cash, with the average cost of acquisition noted at $104,000 per coin. As of June 10, American Bitcoin held a treasury of 215 Bitcoin, reflecting its strategy of strengthening its on-balance-sheet crypto holdings alongside its mining operations. The firm has notable connections with the Trump family, as former President Donald Trump‚Äôs sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, were among the co-founders of American Bitcoin. Hut 8, which acquired a majority stake in the firm on March 31, continues to drive the company‚Äôs strategic direction as it prepares for further growth. Hut 8 Expands to Dubai Amid Crypto Market Push In a parallel move, Hut 8 is expanding its footprint to Dubai, launching a new office registered under Hut 8 Investment Ltd. on June 23, according to a Bloomberg report. The expansion aims to enhance Hut 8‚Äôs crypto trading capabilities and digital asset accumulation strategy, leveraging the UAE‚Äôs favorable crypto regulations and tax structure. Asher Genoot, CEO of Hut 8, stated that the Dubai office will ‚Äúenhance the precision and efficiency of Hut 8‚Äôs capital strategy ,‚Äù allowing the firm to execute trades and manage capital with greater flexibility. However, a spokesperson clarified to Bloomberg that this new Dubai office operates independently of American Bitcoin and does not have operational ties with the subsidiary. The UAE has emerged as a hub for crypto startups in recent years, but companies are still required to maintain robust legal compliance frameworks to navigate evolving local regulations while operating within the jurisdiction. Path Toward Public Listing via Nasdaq Merger In May, it was announced that American Bitcoin would become a publicly traded company by merging with Gryphon Digital Mining, a crypto-mining firm listed on the Nasdaq . The merger, structured as a stock swap, will see the newly combined entity operate under the American Bitcoin brand. Eric Trump is set to join the board following the merger, while existing shareholders of American Bitcoin will retain 98% ownership of the combined company. Hut 8 will continue to oversee operational activities, further positioning American Bitcoin to scale its presence in the mining and crypto treasury sectors as it transitions to public markets.

The end of June showed bullish reawakening in the short term as LINK price seeks a retest of the $18 neckline. This retest is essential for sustaining its upward momentum. The price is currently trying to stabilize around the $13 mark, and a successful break above the $18 level could signal a bullish trend. But if $13 breaks, then it might pull back to $10. LINK Price Prediction 2025 In 2025, Chainlink (LINK) started the year on a downward path, but by April, the tide began to turn. Early in the month, LINK began its recovery from a low of $10.067. By May, it had formed a bullish rounded bottom pattern, with a crucial neckline set at $18. However, since mid-May, LINK has faced challenges in maintaining its position near this neckline. By the third week of June, it pulled back toward the support level of the rounded bottom, which coincides with a multi-year support zone around $11. In the final week of June, LINK‚Äôs price began to rise again, attempting to hold steady near the key $13 mark. If bullish momentum continues, LINK could aim to retest the neckline at $18 in July. For this price advance to sustain itself in the long term, LINK must break above and close daily above the $18 neckline. Such a move could signal a potential upward trend, increasing the chances of retesting the $24 resistance level in Q3 and Q4. This area is supported by a high-volume profile from earlier in the year. If LINK manages to surpass the $24 mark, projections for late 2025 suggest that the token could soar as high as $32.

2025-07-01T10:07:51,"Is the US about to pass the most industry-friendly crypto law yet?","Before the elections, the cryptocurrency industry was characterized by scrutiny, strict policies, and lawsuits. But things are changing rapidly. This month, the Senate passed the GENIUS Act , a bill designed to regulate stablecoins and bring digital assets under federal oversight. This is the first time either chamber has approved major crypto legislation. And with the House now preparing a joint vote on two bills, the United States may soon have its clearest crypto framework yet. What does the GENIUS Act actually do? The GENIUS Act sets out to regulate stablecoins, which are digital tokens pegged to traditional currencies like the US dollar. These coins are meant to offer price stability and are often used for transactions within crypto platforms or across borders. Read also: A financial revolution: how stablecoins are revamping the global payments industry The bill mandates that issuers maintain fully backed reserves, give investors priority in bankruptcy, and comply with anti-money laundering and terrorism financing rules. A new regulatory board will oversee approvals of new stablecoin issuers. Supporters say it‚Äôs about modernizing payments and reinforcing the dollar‚Äôs dominance in a digital age. Senator Bill Hagerty, the bill‚Äôs sponsor, argued that the US must act or risk losing ground in financial innovation. His thesis is that since Americans are already using stablecoins, Washington should support, not oppose. What does the public really want from crypto regulation? According to CoinCover‚Äôs latest Trust Factor Report , the appetite for stronger guardrails is clear. In a survey of over 1,000 individuals across multiple regions, 82% said they believe the crypto industry needs a global regulatory framework. 67% said they‚Äôd be more likely to invest, or invest even more, if crypto were regulated like traditional assets such as stocks and bonds. Source: CoinCover The takeaway is simple: users aren‚Äôt rejecting oversight. They‚Äôre asking for it. Almost half of the respondents had either experienced or witnessed irreversible losses due to scams, fraud, or lost access to wallets. That explains why nearly 80% supported compensation schemes for victims of hacks or technical failures. The message is not that regulation threatens innovation. The opposite is true. It‚Äôs that meaningful oversight is a prerequisite for trust, adoption, and scale. Do experts agree on what kind of regulation is needed? The Trust Factor Report doesn‚Äôt just reflect retail sentiment. It also draws from interviews with some of the industry‚Äôs most active operators and legal experts. And while their perspectives vary, most agree on one thing: traditional financial rules don‚Äôt work for crypto. Unlike banks or broker-dealers, crypto companies are often vertically integrated. They operate exchanges, custody wallets, and staking services, all under one roof. Applying legacy frameworks built for siloed institutions only increases friction. Instead, experts call for tailored regulation that reflects the technology‚Äôs structure. Regulation should match how value moves, how custody is handled, and how risk is distributed, not just how a service looks on paper. They also stress the importance of stablecoin clarity. When reserve rules and issuer obligations are clear, capital can flow more freely. That means more involvement from hedge funds, family offices, and even traditional banks. Consumer protection is another top priority. The failures of FTX, Celsius, and Terra have shown that transparency around reserves and internal controls isn‚Äôt optional. It‚Äôs essential. There‚Äôs also broad consensus that global alignment is coming, even if full harmonization isn‚Äôt realistic. Core principles like anti-money laundering, cybersecurity, and market integrity are expected to converge, especially among Western regulators. Finally, privacy and decentralization are key topics of discussion. But the dominant view is that regulators should focus on access points like exchanges and wallet providers without trying to police decentralized protocols themselves. The goal is to protect users, not force the industry back into centralized models. Why the US and Europe are moving in different directions The GENIUS Act is part of a wider effort that sets the US apart from other jurisdictions. Under the Trump administration, the US is leaning into permissive, business-friendly policies, especially when it comes to stablecoins . Source: Bloomberg That stands in contrast to the European Union‚Äôs MiCA framework, which is broader in scope and significantly more restrictive. MiCA introduces high compliance requirements, strict license terms, and clear boundaries around stablecoins, NFTs, and DeFi. Some see MiCA as a benchmark for institutional trust. Others view it as a barrier that could push innovation elsewhere. In the UK and UAE, hybrid approaches are emerging. These jurisdictions are trying to balance sandbox-style flexibility with long-term clarity, hoping to position themselves as innovation hubs without sacrificing security or investor protection. The divergence is especially important as capital, talent, and startups will gravitate toward the jurisdictions that offer both regulatory clarity and room to grow. What happens next? The House is expected to vote on the GENIUS Act in early July , possibly bundling it with the Clarity Act, which addresses crypto market structure more broadly. That strategy could accelerate both bills or stall them, depending on political dynamics. Trump has been publicly pushing for speed. But internal divisions and concerns over bundling may cause delays, especially as the Clarity Act faces scrutiny in the Senate‚Äôs Banking and Agriculture Committees. If passed, the GENIUS Act will immediately bring stablecoins under federal oversight. That would likely trigger a wave of compliance efforts among US-based issuers and could prompt institutional players to enter the market. Looking further ahead, we can expect more state-level frameworks to emerge, especially as regulators attempt to address gaps left by federal legislation. Meanwhile, other countries will be waiting to see if the US gains a competitive advantage by moving first on stablecoin regulation.

2025-07-01T10:03:08,"Historic Ethereum (ETH) Decision Comes from Bitcoin Mining Company! Wall Street Giant Tom Lee Speaks Assertively!","While altcoins are also prominent in institutional acceptance after Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH) is leading in this regard. While Ethereum accumulation has also increased after BTC recently, the last move at this point came from Bitcoin miner BitMine Immersion Technologies. According to official statements, US-based Bitcoin mining company BitMine announced that it has made Ethereum the primary reserve asset. At this point, BitMine stated that it has gone to the capital increase path and will raise $250 million and will purchase Ethereum. The company also added that Tom Lee, a well-known Wall Street analyst, has been elected chairman of the board. The company stated that the capital increase was carried out under the leadership of MOZAYYX with the participation of a high-level investor group including Founders Fund, Pantera, FalconX, Republic Digital, Kraken, Galaxy Digital, DCG and Thomas Lee. Stablecoins are the ‚ÄúChatGPT‚Äù of cryptocurrencies, said BitMine President Thomas Lee, adding that he expects Ethereum to follow suit. ‚ÄúEthereum is the blockchain on which most stablecoin payments are made, so ETH should benefit from this growth,‚Äù Lee said. Tom Lee stated that BitMine will follow a strategy similar to MicroStrategy‚Äôs ‚ÄúBTC Yield‚Äù measure of Bitcoin per share. The company added that it will monitor the value of ETH held per share of the company as a key performance metric. BitMine‚Äôs move comes after SharpLink Gaming‚Äôs ETH moves, which is on its way to becoming Etheruem‚Äôs MicroStrategy.

2025-07-01T10:00:44,"Ethereum Just Got Its MicroStrategy‚ÄîTom Lee Bets On Soaring ETH Price","Nearly three years after the Merge formally switched Ethereum to proof-of-stake on 15 September 2022, a publicly listed Bitcoin miner is adopting the network‚Äôs native token as its primary treasury asset. BitMine Immersion Technologies (NYSE American: BMNR) on 30 June priced a $250 million private placement of 55,555,556 new shares at $4.50 each and appointed Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee as chairman. The company‚Äôs SEC filing and press release make the purpose explicit: all net proceeds will be used to acquire and stake ether, a move management likens to Michael Saylor‚Äôs now-legendary Bitcoin strategy at MicroStrategy. Tom Lee Goes Full MicroStrategy On Ethereum Speaking hours later on CNBC‚Äôs Squawk Box, Lee framed the pivot as a logical response to the explosive growth of stablecoins, most of which settle on Ethereum. ‚ÄúStablecoins, which is the ChatGPT of crypto, because it‚Äôs viral adoption by consumers, businesses, banks and now even Visa,‚Äù he said, underscoring why a treasury heavy in ETH could become strategically indispensable. Ethereum‚Äôs proof-of-stake design means that large holders who validate blocks ‚Äúsecure the fidelity of stablecoins,‚Äù Lee continued. ‚ÄúWhen Goldman issues a stablecoin and JP Morgan [issues] it on Ethereum as a layer-one blockchain, they‚Äôre going to want to secure it by staking Ethereum.‚Äù Related Reading: Top Analyst Predicts Major Ethereum Rally Toward $4,000 As Shorts Hit All-Time Highs Lee tied the long-term upside to macro numbers the US Treasury itself has started to cite. Stablecoins today hover around $250 billion; Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently suggested the figure could hit $2 trillion‚Äîa potential ten-fold expansion that, in Lee‚Äôs words, would ‚Äúinsure dollar dominance.‚Äù Because Ethereum already underpins more than half of stable-value tokens, a multi-trillion-dollar stablecoin market would translate directly into rising transaction fees for the network and, by extension, higher staking rewards for BitMine‚Äôs planned validator clusters. The private-placement syndicate reads like a who‚Äôs-who roster from both TradFi and crypto: MOZAYYX led the round, joined by Founders Fund, Pantera, FalconX, Republic Digital, Kraken, Galaxy Digital, Digital Currency Group, Diametric Capital and Occam Crest. Closing is expected on or about 3 July, subject to NYSE American approval. BitMine, headquartered in Las Vegas, will immediately deploy the ETH position into staking, giving the miner a yield-bearing balance-sheet asset while reinforcing Ethereum‚Äôs security budget. ‚ÄúOne of the key performance metrics for BitMine going forward is to increase the value of ETH held per share,‚Äù chief executive Jonathan Bates said in the statement. For investors, the comparison with MicroStrategy is unavoidable but imperfect. Saylor‚Äôs company amassed bitcoin under a proof-of-work regime that offers no native yield; BitMine‚Äôs ether can generate income through both staking rewards and potential capital-markets transactions collateralized by those staked coins. Related Reading: Strong Ethereum Accumulation Detected: LTH Buying Heavy During June Consolidation Yet both strategies share a central bet: that a scarce digital asset sitting at the core of global finance will appreciate faster than cash alternatives on a corporate balance sheet. Whether BitMine achieves MicroStrategy-level returns will depend on execution, regulatory clarity for staking, and‚Äîmost of all‚ÄîEthereum‚Äôs price path. What is clear, however, is that corporate treasuries are beginning to see ether not merely as ‚Äúgas‚Äù for decentralized applications but as a strategic reserve asset in its own right. From a market-structure vantage, the new treasury model could translate into meaningful price torque for Ether if it scales. MicroStrategy‚Äôs serial purchases have now absorbed nearly 600,000 BTC‚Äîaround 2.8 percent of the 21 million-coin cap‚Äîand coincided with Bitcoin‚Äôs ascent from roughly $11,000 in August 2020, when the company made its first buy, to more than $107,000 today, a near-ten-fold move. BitMine‚Äôs opening salvo‚Äî$250 million, or about 100,000 ETH at current prices‚Äîrepresents barely 0.08 percent of Ethereum‚Äôs 122 million-coin supply, yet roughly 28 percent of that supply is already locked in staking contracts while net issuance has turned negative post-EIP-1559, shrinking the freely tradable float. If even a handful of additional balance sheets emulate this ‚ÄúETH-as-reserve‚Äù playbook, the resulting demand shock could replicate the supply-squeeze dynamics that propelled Bitcoin into six-figure territory. At press time, Ether traded at $2,459.

2025-07-01T09:44:20,"Bitcoin Pepe price outlook as major German bank plans to provide crypto trading","German banking group Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe reportedly intends to launch crypto trading services, providing its more than 50 million customers with access to crypto trading by the summer of 2026. Dekabank, which is owned by Sparkassen, has been chosen to manage this new crypto service through the Sparkasse app, according to a Bloomberg report. The German Savings Banks Association (DSGV) stated that the Savings Banks Finance Group will offer ‚Äúreliable access to a regulated crypto offering.‚Äù The DSGV also noted that the crypto service addresses existing demand and is covered under the European Union‚Äôs MiCA regulatory framework for crypto, which became effective in December. As more financial firms embrace crypto, early-stage projects such as Bitcoin Pepe are expected to benefit. The project is continuing strength in its presale. Shifting stance on Crypto in German banking Previously, Sparkassen executives had dismissed crypto-related services due to concerns about volatility and risk. The banking group also restricted crypto purchases for all customers in 2015. Despite this shift in direction, the DSGV reportedly emphasized that its ‚Äúposition remains clear, cryptocurrencies are highly speculative investments.‚Äù It was also stated that there would be no advertising for the new service, and customers would be informed about potential risks, including ‚Äúpotential for total loss.‚Äù Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe encompasses over 50 million customers and 500 companies, including more than 370 savings banks, with total aggregated assets under management exceeding 2.5 trillion euros ($2.9 trillion). Filipp Bolotov, founder and CEO of ERA Labs, commented on Sparkassen‚Äôs move into crypto, calling it a ‚Äúbig move for mainstream adoption.‚Äù Similarly, Kyle Chasse, a crypto venture capitalist and founder of Master Ventures, remarked that ‚Äúbanks are catching up.‚Äù Other German banks have also begun integrating crypto services. In September 2024, Germany‚Äôs second-largest financial institution, DZ Bank, partnered with Boerse Stuttgart Digital for a crypto service pilot. It planned to introduce trading and custody services to its network of 700 cooperative banks following an initial testing phase. Additionally, Germany‚Äôs largest federal bank, Landesbank Baden-W√ºrttemberg, announced in April of the previous year that it would offer crypto custody solutions to institutional clients in collaboration with Bitpanda, an Austria-based crypto exchange. Bitcoin Pepe makes new waves in crypto Bitcoin Pepe is establishing a unique position within the cryptocurrency market by integrating viral appeal with infrastructure development. This project operates as a Layer 2 solution, leveraging Bitcoin‚Äôs underlying security while aiming for scalability comparable to networks like Solana. This strategy differentiates it from many meme-centric cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin Pepe, noted as the first meme-focused Layer 2 solution built on Bitcoin, is also expanding its reach through strategic partnerships. These collaborations span various sectors, including gaming, content creation, decentralized finance (DeFi), and fair launch infrastructure. The objective of these partnerships is to cultivate an ecosystem where the BPEP token offers cross-chain utility and cultural relevance. Such alliances are intended to boost visibility and adoption, reflecting growing support for the PEP-20 token standard from both institutional entities and the wider community. The project‚Äôs infrastructure-focused approach appears to be attracting investor interest, with its ongoing presale having already secured over $16.2 million. Further contributing to its momentum are confirmed listings on the MEXC and BitMart exchanges. The project team is scheduled to make the final listing announcement on July 31st.

2025-07-01T09:34:42,"Bit Digital Makes A Massive Bet On Ethereum","Summary In June 2024, I rated Bit Digital a 'strong buy' due to its early and successful pivot to HPC revenue. Missed HPC revenue guidance, and shifting GPU market dynamics, made me less optimistic about long-term prospects later last year. A recent 75 million share offering and questionable capital allocation strategy further cloud the investment outlook, making me cautious on BTBT now. The company wants to spin out its HPC/AI subsidiary WhiteFiber via IPO. I believe shareholders would benefit from such a move. Bit Digital ( BTBT ) is one of the stocks I've covered the most for Seeking Alpha in recent years. It's also one of the few stocks that I have labeled with a 'strong buy' tag in the past. That strong buy call came last June and was predicated on the assumption that Bit Digital was a strong buyout candidate in a market that was seeing Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining stocks shift operations to HPC businesses. Bit Digital was one of the first companies to do this and to date is still one of the most successful examples of such a pivot. BTBT Calls (Seeking Alpha) More recently, I've soured a bit on the company's long-term prospects after annualized HPC revenue guidance was missed last year, market dynamics for GPU as-a-service models began to change , and Bit Digital embarked on a capital allocation strategy that I found to be questionable in my most recent piece from March. Subsequent to my March piece, we have another quarter of corporate performance and a recent capital raise to assess. Q1-25 Earnings The quarter ended-March was a fairly transformative one for Bit Digital. Not only did the company see a significant 17.4% reduction in top line revenue year over year, but the company's revenue from its Digital Asset Mining segment plummeted by 64.5% from Q1-24: Revenue Q1-25 Q1-24 YoY Digital Asset Mining $7,776,963 $21,891,760 -64.5% Cloud Services $14,842,286 $8,069,584 83.9% Colocation Services $1,644,663 $0 ETH Staking $560,641 $325,746 72.1% Other $280,567 $99,748 181.3% Total Revenue $25,105,120 $30,386,838 -17.4% Source: Bit Digital, Form 10-Q In spite of 84% year-over-year growth in revenue from Cloud Services, Bit Digital simply couldn't overcome the decline from mining to produce a positive year-over-year gain in the top line figure. For context, mining made up just 31% of Bit Digital's total revenue in Q1-25. That segment accounted for 72% of revenue in Q1-24 and 54% during the full year 2024. The decline in revenue from mining has been well telegraphed for several months. The company even stopped releasing monthly production numbers early in the year. Profit Margin Q1-25 Q1-24 YoY Digital Asset Mining 21.3% 40.7% -47.8% Cloud Services 59.0% 60.9% -3.1% Colocation Services 66.8% ETH Staking 94.2% 95.0% -0.8% Source: Bit Digital, Form 10-Q It certainly isn't a surprise to see the margin from mining collapse by 48% year over year. Q1-24 was the last full quarter of pre-halving Bitcoin production. CEO Sam Tabar has steadfastly opposed a hash-growth at any cost philosophy, and I think the transformation we're currently seeing in the company's business is proof of that. Still, there are concerns going forward. For instance, despite producing 59% gross margins in Q1-25, Bit Digital's Cloud Service revenue is still well below the $100 million annualized run rate that was expected by the end of last year. Operating income Q1-25 Q1-24 Total Revenue $25,105,120 $30,386,838 Opex Sans Digital Asset Gain/Loss -$28,268,205 -$28,960,381 Operating Income -$3,163,085 $1,426,457 Source: Bit Digital, Form 10-Q - Author's calculation Essentially, every public Bitcoin miner utilizes FASB accounting rules that allow the companies to show unrealized gains in the digital assets that they hold as income (or losses). Stripping that out from Bit Digital's report, we can see that the company flipped from positive operating income in Q1-24 to negative in Q1-25. This should be alleviated in the future as Bitcoin mining becomes a less significant driver of both COGS and revenue. That said, the company's recent capital allocation moves have been substantial. A Massive Wager On Ethereum Prior to releasing Q1 earnings, we already knew that Bit Digital was beginning to position as more of an Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) proxy than a Bitcoin proxy. The company held $91.3 million in ETH and $78.8 million in BTC at the end of January. Two months later, those figures were dramatically different: Digital Assets Quantity Cost Basis Fair Value BTC 417.6 $25,456,846 $34,474,294 ETH 24,434.20 $59,917,193 $44,556,466 Total digital assets held as of March 31, 2025 $85,374,039 $79,030,760 Source: Bit Digital, Form 10-Q At the end of January, ETH had a market value of $3,300 per coin. By the end of March, that price had been nearly cut in half, down to $1,800 per coin. This is what I said at the end of my March BTBT piece: This may be a spicy take, but if I were CEO Sam Tabar, I would completely abandon the ETH staking business entirely. There are two reasons for this. First, ETH has been a total drag on the company's digital asset value and I laid that out in the section above. That could certainly turn around, but that's far from a sure thing. The bigger issue is really simple; if Bit Digital can't rely on capital appreciation from ETH the way it can from BTC, then it would almost certainly be more beneficial for the company to deploy that capital differently. Last summer, the company had sold BTC and swapped it to ETH - that turned out to be a horrific decision with the benefit of hindsight. During Q1-25, the company sold even more BTC and hung on to its ETH. CEO Sam Tabar from the conference call: we also sold approximately $32 million worth of Bitcoin holdings during the quarter to help fund growth while managing our use of equity issuance . We did not sell any ETH during the quarter, but transferred 3,400 into an internally managed fund, which we do not count as treasury holdings. I've bolded part of the quote above because I think this is important. Leadership has openly acknowledged the poor optics associated with the size of the company's ATM relative to the market capitalization of BTBT stock. Given this, I find it strange that Bit Digital opted to raise capital through shareholder dilution to buy even more ETH. Capital Allocation & WhiteFiber IPO On June 26th, Bit Digital announced the pricing of $150 million equity raise at $2 per share for 75 million new shares of BTBT stock. Notably, the company's stock had closed at $2.35 per share the prior session. Thus, the offering came at a 15% discount to the market value of the stock just one day earlier. After underwriter fees, the company receives $142.5 million, with use of proceeds going toward purchasing ETH. It's hard for me to view this favorably for three reasons. Bit Digital just sold Digital Assets to fund growth rather than issuing equity, only to turn around just a couple months later and issue equity to buy Digital Assets. It's a rather striking 180. While the company's ETH staking is its best business segment by gross margin, the revenue from the segment is by far the smallest of four dis-aggregated business lines. Furthermore, the staking business may not be intense from an opex standpoint, but it does tie up a considerable amount of capital for a very small percentage of top line revenue. This move essentially triples down on a capital allocation strategy that hasn't been working. Namely, allowing Bit Digital's equity valuation to be dependent on a risk asset that has weak sentiment and arguably deteriorating fundamentals. All while the company wants to raise through an active ATM. In the prospectus, Bit Digital expressed conviction in the Ethereum ecosystem and specifically mentioned legislation around stablecoins in the US as cause for optimism: Given increased regulatory clarity, including the recently passed GENIUS Act, we view ETH as a digitally native store of value and foundational infrastructure for decentralized applications and stablecoins. Accordingly, we intend to grow our ETH position over time, supported by staking rewards. Looking past the fact that the GENIUS Act has actually not been passed yet by the House of Representatives, I see it as a risky move to further tie the valuation of the company to an asset that Bit Digital can't ultimately control rather than focusing on raising that capital to fund growth of WhiteFiber. On the latter, it's very interesting to me that Bit Digital is trying to spin out WhiteFiber. As a wholly owned subsidiary of Bit Digital, WhiteFiber submitted a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a proposed IPO. Share count and pricing of such an IPO have yet to be determined. But this would seem to be an attempt to get the same kind of value on its data center business that the market is currently giving companies like Core Scientific ( CORZ ) or IREN Limited ( IREN ) - each of which actually had less HPC/AI revenue than Bit Digital in Q1 yet continue to trade a much larger forward sales multiples than that of BTBT: Data by YCharts To some degree, I suspect the lack of apparent HPC respect for BTBT relative to peers is due to the company having such a large allocation to ETH. For those who would rather see Bit Digital focus capital on scaling cloud services, these ETH purchases are perhaps frustrating. But in the event WhiteFiber does IPO and is successfully spun out of BTBT, holding BTBT is perhaps warranted. Valuation And Assets Per the offering prospectus, there would be an estimated 283.5 million BTBT common shares outstanding following completion of the offering. By my math, that dilutes the current holder base by roughly 36%. And at a $2.19 share close on June 30th, Bit Digital has an implied valuation of $621 million at that 283.5 million shares count. Following the $150 million capital raise, Bit Digital will have about $204 million in ETH, $45 million in BTC, $297 million in non-current assets, and $99 million in combined cash and 'other current assets' as of Q1-25. Short of an absolute collapse in the price of Ethereum, stock price downside from here should be somewhat limited, provided the company doesn't continue to aggressively dilute. Closing Summary I think a WhiteFiber IPO would be a good thing for both Bit Digital and Bit Digital shareholders. It will allow the market to pick between two very different business models currently operated by one parent company. Given the substantial rallies we've seen from stocks like CoreWeave, Core Scientific, and IREN Limited on the proposed buyout of Core Scientific by CoreWeave, there's no reason Bit Digital shouldn't benefit from spinning out its HPC/AI subsidiary - especially given the segment revenue its doing relative to some of those other stocks mentioned. Having said all of this, I'm a bit concerned about Bit Digital's Ethereum reliance. Despite being well off its coin price highs, Ethereum is far from cheap on a circulating P/F ratio. A re-rating lower in ETH would severely impact Bit Digital's stock valuation. I'll reiterate the 'hold.'",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4798514-bit-digital-makes-massive-bet-ethereum?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BUSINESS|ETH|BTC|MINING|MARKET","ETH-USD|BTBT",cryptocompare

Arkham Intelligence detected the transaction on June 30, involving 0.185 BTC sent to the address that holds approximately $117 billion in dormant Bitcoin. The transfer represents the second-largest donation to Satoshi‚Äôs address since February, when another user sent $200,000 following a Binance withdrawal. Arkham analysts suspect the latest transaction was either an accidental exchange withdrawal or a deliberate tribute from ‚Äú an OG Bitcoiner giving back ‚Äù to honor Bitcoin‚Äôs enigmatic founder. Source: Arkham Intelligence Historical data reveals a pattern of periodic donations to Satoshi‚Äôs addresses, with transfers ranging from $7,140 to $1.17 million over recent years. Most large transfers appear to be connected to exchange withdrawals, suggesting possible user errors rather than intentional gifts, although the motivations behind these transactions remain unclear. Satoshi‚Äôs wallet now contains the equivalent of $117 billion in Bitcoin across multiple addresses, all of which have remained untouched since the creator‚Äôs disappearance in 2011. Source: Arkham Intelligence Any movement from these addresses would likely trigger massive market volatility and intense global attention. Exchange Withdrawals Drive Mysterious Donation Pattern The latest $20,000 transfer follows a documented pattern of substantial Bitcoin donations to Satoshi Nakamoto‚Äôs addresses, with most large transactions appearing linked to cryptocurrency exchange operations. Arkham‚Äôs analysis suggests the recent transfer likely originated from an exchange or crypto service withdrawal, consistent with previous high-value donations. February‚Äôs $200,000 transfer originated from a personal wallet after the sender withdrew funds from Binance. Source: Arkham Intelligence The pattern suggests either systematic user errors during withdrawal processes or deliberate tribute payments by early Bitcoin adopters, despite Nakamoto‚Äôs 14-year absence from public communications. Historical transfer data shows significant variations in donation amounts and timing. A $1.17 million transfer occurred one year ago from address bc1***6v2, representing the largest single donation on record. This was followed by smaller amounts, including $67,790 two years ago and $41,670 three years ago. Early Bitcoin era miners have significantly reduced their selling activity, with 2025 sales dropping to just 150 BTC compared to 10,000 BTC sold in the previous year. Some analysts interpret these donations as a sign of community support for the Satoshi-era miners who helped establish Bitcoin‚Äôs initial network security. Identity Speculation Intensifies Amid Legal Battles The mystery surrounding Satoshi Nakamoto‚Äôs identity has intensified dramatically as multiple investigations, documentaries, and legal proceedings attempt to uncover the identity of Bitcoin‚Äôs creator. Recent speculation has centered on Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey , with researchers citing circumstantial evidence, including timing coincidences and connections to the cypherpunk movement. Sean Murray‚Äôs research highlighted alleged connections between Dorsey and Nakamoto, including shared interests in cryptography and references to sailors in early Bitcoin code. VanEck‚Äôs Matthew Sigel described the evidence as ‚Äú compelling and worthy of further scrutiny ,‚Äù although critics dismissed the claims as speculative without concrete proof. In the spirit of full disclosure, intellectual honesty, posterity's judgment, and rigorous debate, I would like to share my strong belief: I have become personally convinced that Jack Dorsey ‚Äì CEO of Square and founder of X ‚Äì is Bitcoin‚Äôs founder Satoshi Nakamoto.

Judge James Mellor sentenced Wright to one year in prison , suspended for two years, after finding ‚Äúoverwhelming‚Äù evidence he is not Bitcoin‚Äôs creator. Legal pressure on government agencies has also escalated, with crypto lawyer James Murphy filing Freedom of Information Act lawsuits against the Department of Homeland Security. Murphy seeks documents related to claims that DHS identified and interviewed Satoshi Nakamoto in California, though the agency has never confirmed these allegations. Most interestingly, HBO filmmaker Cullen Hoback‚Äôs documentary named Canadian Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd as the creator of Bitcoin, prompting Todd to go into hiding for safety reasons. However, despite all the exciting efforts to identify Bitcoin‚Äôs creator, it has sparked controversy within the cryptocurrency community, with many questioning the ethics of attempting to expose Satoshi‚Äôs identity.

2025-07-01T09:30:17,"AI Regulation: Congress‚Äôs Alarming Push to Block State AI Laws for Five Years","BitcoinWorld AI Regulation: Congress‚Äôs Alarming Push to Block State AI Laws for Five Years In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, where decentralized technologies like cryptocurrency thrive on innovation, a significant debate is unfolding in Washington that could reshape the future of artificial intelligence. Congress is currently deliberating a federal proposal to impose an AI moratorium , potentially banning states and local governments from regulating AI for five years. This move, reminiscent of debates around digital asset regulation, has sparked intense discussion among tech leaders, policymakers, and consumer advocates alike. The Proposed AI Moratorium : What‚Äôs on the Table? A federal proposal that would prohibit states and local governments from regulating AI for half a decade could soon become law. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) and other lawmakers are working to include this provision in a major GOP budget bill, which the Senate is voting on this Monday, ahead of a critical July 4 deadline. This measure, initially conceived to ban states from enforcing any laws or regulations on AI models, systems, or automated decision systems for a decade, has seen revisions. Over the weekend, Senator Cruz and Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) agreed to shorten the pause on state-based AI regulation to five years. The updated language attempts to exempt laws addressing child sexual abuse materials, children‚Äôs online safety, and an individual‚Äôs rights to their name, likeness, voice, and image. However, a crucial caveat states that such laws must not place an ‚Äúundue or disproportionate burden‚Äù on AI systems. Legal experts are uncertain how this would impact existing or future state AI laws , creating a cloud of ambiguity over their enforceability. Fueling AI Innovation or Stifling Progress? Proponents of the federal AI moratorium, including prominent figures like OpenAI‚Äôs Sam Altman, Anduril‚Äôs Palmer Luckey, and a16z‚Äôs Marc Andreessen, argue that a fragmented approach to AI regulation across states would hinder American AI innovation . They contend that a ‚Äúpatchwork‚Äù of diverse state laws would make it excessively difficult for AI companies to operate and scale, especially at a time when the global race to dominate AI, particularly against China, is intensifying. The argument is that a unified federal approach, even if it means a temporary pause on state action, would provide the necessary clarity and freedom for AI developers to innovate rapidly without navigating a labyrinth of differing local rules. This perspective emphasizes speed and competitiveness on the international stage as paramount. Safeguarding Consumer Protection : The Case Against Federal Preemption Critics of the proposed moratorium argue that it would severely undermine consumer protection and accountability in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. This group includes most Democrats, many Republicans, Anthropic‚Äôs CEO Dario Amodei, labor groups, AI safety nonprofits, and consumer rights advocates. They warn that this provision would block states from passing vital laws designed to protect citizens from AI harms, effectively allowing powerful AI firms to operate with minimal oversight. The moratorium threatens to preempt state AI laws that have already been enacted. For example, California‚Äôs AB 2013 requires companies to disclose the data used to train AI systems, offering transparency to consumers. Similarly, Tennessee‚Äôs ELVIS Act protects musicians and creators from AI-generated impersonations, a direct response to emerging AI harms. Public Citizen has compiled a database revealing numerous AI-related laws across states that could be nullified, many of which address specific harms like deceptive AI-generated media used to influence elections, a concern shared by states like Alabama, Arizona, California, Delaware, Hawaii, Indiana, Montana, and Texas. Furthermore, several noteworthy AI safety bills awaiting signature, such as New York‚Äôs RAISE Act, which would mandate large AI labs nationwide to publish thorough safety reports, are also at risk. Opponents argue that allowing a federal vacuum in regulation for five years leaves consumers vulnerable to unchecked AI development. The Fiscal Leverage: How Funding Ties Into State AI Laws Getting the AI moratorium into a budget bill has required some creative legislative maneuvering. Budget bill provisions typically need a direct fiscal impact. To meet this requirement, Senator Cruz revised the proposal in June to make compliance with the AI moratorium a condition for states to receive funds from the $42 billion Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD) program. This strategic move leverages federal funding as an incentive for states to adhere to the federal AI pause. Cruz released another revision last week, claiming it ties the requirement only to a new $500 million in BEAD funding included in the bill‚Äîa separate, additional pot of money. However, a closer examination of the revised text suggests the language also threatens to pull already obligated broadband funding from states that do not comply. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) previously criticized Cruz‚Äôs original language, stating it ‚Äúforces states receiving BEAD funding to choose between expanding broadband or protecting consumers from AI harms for ten years.‚Äù This fiscal pressure adds another layer of complexity to the debate. What‚Äôs Next for AI Regulation in Congress? As of Monday, the Senate is engaged in a ‚Äúvote-a-rama‚Äù‚Äîa series of rapid votes on the budget bill‚Äôs numerous amendments. The new language agreed upon by Cruz and Blackburn will be part of a broader amendment that Republicans are expected to pass along party lines. Senators will also likely vote on a Democrat-backed amendment aimed at stripping the entire AI moratorium section from the bill. The outcome of these votes will determine the immediate future of AI regulation in the U.S. The debate extends beyond Capitol Hill. Chris Lehane, chief global affairs officer at OpenAI, stated that the ‚Äúcurrent patchwork approach to regulating AI isn‚Äôt working and will continue to worsen if we stay on this path.‚Äù He warned of ‚Äúserious implications‚Äù for the U.S. in the AI dominance race against China, even quoting Vladimir Putin on the importance of AI leadership. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman echoed these sentiments, expressing concern that a state-by-state patchwork would be ‚Äúa real mess and very difficult to offer services under.‚Äù Altman also questioned whether policymakers could keep pace with rapidly evolving AI technology to craft effective regulations. The Public‚Äôs Stance on Consumer Protection While proponents of the moratorium advocate for a ‚Äúlight touch‚Äù approach to AI governance, public sentiment appears to lean differently. A recent Pew Research survey found that most Americans desire more AI regulation . Approximately 60% of U.S. adults and 56% of AI experts are more concerned that the U.S. government won‚Äôt go far enough in regulating AI than they are about over-regulation. Americans also largely lack confidence in the government‚Äôs ability to regulate AI effectively and remain skeptical of industry efforts around responsible AI. This public desire for stronger oversight stands in contrast to the proposed federal pause on state action. The Case Against Preemption: Why States Matter ‚ÄúThe patchwork argument is something that we have heard since the beginning of consumer advocacy time,‚Äù Emily Peterson-Cassin, corporate power director at internet activist group Demand Progress, told Bitcoin World. ‚ÄúBut the fact is that companies comply with different state regulations all the time. The most powerful companies in the world? Yes. Yes, you can.‚Äù This counter-argument suggests that large tech companies are well-equipped to navigate varying state laws, as they do in other industries. Opponents and cynics argue that the AI moratorium is less about fostering innovation and more about sidestepping oversight. While many states have passed AI regulations, Congress, known for its slow pace, has yet to pass any comprehensive federal AI laws. ‚ÄúIf the federal government wants to pass strong AI safety legislation, and then preempt the states‚Äô ability to do that, I‚Äôd be the first to be very excited about that,‚Äù said Nathan Calvin, VP of state affairs at the nonprofit Encode. ‚ÄúInstead, [the AI moratorium] takes away all leverage, and any ability, to force AI companies to come to the negotiating table.‚Äù Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, a vocal critic, stated in an opinion piece for The New York Times that ‚Äúa 10-year moratorium is far too blunt an instrument.‚Äù He emphasized AI‚Äôs rapid advancement, predicting fundamental changes within two years. Amodei argued that without a clear federal plan, a moratorium would result in the worst outcome: no state action and no national policy. He suggested that instead of prescribing product release methods, the government should collaborate with AI companies to establish transparency standards for practices and model capabilities. The opposition isn‚Äôt limited to Democrats. Republicans like Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) are concerned about states‚Äô rights and are working with Democrats to remove the provision. Senator Blackburn, despite her involvement in the amendment, has also criticized the provision, advocating for states‚Äô ability to protect citizens and creative industries. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) even threatened to oppose the entire budget if the moratorium remains. A Critical Juncture for AI Governance The debate over the federal AI moratorium represents a critical juncture for AI governance in the United States. It pits the desire for rapid AI innovation and global competitiveness against the fundamental need for consumer protection and robust oversight. The outcome of the Senate‚Äôs vote-a-rama will not only shape the regulatory landscape for artificial intelligence for the next five years but also set a precedent for how federal and state governments interact in regulating rapidly evolving technologies. As the digital world continues its relentless march forward, finding a balanced approach that fosters innovation while safeguarding the public remains the paramount challenge.

2025-07-01T09:30:14,"XRP, ETH Traders Getting Greedy? Funding Rates Highest Among Top Coins","Data shows XRP and Ethereum top the Funding Rate charts among the major cryptocurrencies, a sign of growing demand for long positions. XRP & Ethereum Funding Rates Have Turned Sharply Positive In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed about how the top cryptocurrencies by market cap currently compare in terms of the Funding Rate . The Funding Rate refers to an indicator that keeps track of the amount of periodic fees that the investors on the perpetual futures market are paying each other on the various centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric is positive, it means the long investors are paying a premium to the short ones in order to hold onto their positions. Such a trend suggests the presence of a bullish bias in the derivatives market. On the other hand, the indicator being under the zero mark implies the short positions outweigh the long ones and a bearish sentiment is shared by the majority of the traders. Now, here is the table shared by Glassnode that shows the current Funding Rate for the major assets in the sector: As is visible above, all of these assets except for one have their Funding Rate above the 0% level. For many, however, the metric still has only a small value, meaning that the sentiment tends more or less neutral. Among the coins with a long bias, XRP and Ethereum particularly stand out, with the metric sitting at 0.093% and 0.083%, respectively. For comparison, the coin with the third highest Funding Rate, Tron (TRX), stands at 0.0052%. The change to this highly positive sentiment has come for the two coins as on-chain metrics have been giving indefinite signals. The Supply in Profit is at 79.5% for XRP and 64.7% for ETH. This means while the majority of the supply is in the green, the distribution isn‚Äôt as extreme as for Bitcoin (98.4%) or Tron (96.6%). Both of the cryptocurrencies have noted a decline in Daily Active Addresses , which measures the daily number of addresses taking part in transfer activity on the network. The metric is down 11.4% for ETH and 34.3% for XRP. While active users themselves have become fewer, it would appear that those who are left have ramped up activity, as the On-Chain Volume is up by 74.5% for the former and 637.3% for the latter. Despite the mixed conditions, futures market users are putting on bullish bets. ‚ÄúThis signals growing demand for long exposure, even as on-chain activity and sentiment remain mixed,‚Äù notes the analytics firm. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $2.21, up almost 9% in the last week.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-eth-greedy-funding-rates-highest-top-coins/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","XRP|ETH|Ethereum|Ethereum Funding Rates|XRP Funding Rates|XRPUSDT",cryptocompare
2025-07-01T09:30:00,"Analysts Give 95% Chance for Solana, XRP & LTC ETF Approval","This optimistic outlook is a jump from the previous 90% estimate and means that there is growing confidence in the broader acceptance of crypto investment products. In addition to these altcoins, a basket ETF composed of multiple crypto assets is also expected to be approved soon. Meanwhile, the US is set to launch its first-ever staked crypto ETF‚Äîthe REX-Osprey Solana and Staking ETF‚Äîthis week. It will offer exposure to spot Solana with staking rewards. Solana‚Äôs price jumped on the news, and its DeFi ecosystem continues to outpace Ethereum in DEX volume. At the same time, crypto ETPs saw $2.7 billion in inflows last week, bringing the H1 total to $17.8 billion. Bitcoin ETPs led the charge, while XRP also showed strong momentum despite still pending US ETF approval. CoinShares data showed that BlackRock dominated issuer inflows. Good Approval Odds for Solana, XRP and LTC ETFs Analysts at Bloomberg raised the odds of approval for several highly anticipated crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). They now forecast a 95% chance that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will greenlight spot ETFs for Solana, XRP, and Litecoin by the end of the year. This is an increase from the previous 90% estimate, which means that there is growing optimism in the ETF research community that other crypto investment products will soon be available to US investors. The update came from Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, who said in a post on X that they expect a ‚Äùwave of new ETFs‚Äù in the second half of 2025. Alongside individual altcoins, they also predict a 95% approval likelihood for a spot ETF based on a basket or index of crypto assets‚Äîpotentially arriving as early as this week. Other altcoins like Dogecoin, Cardano, Polkadot, Hedera, and Avalanche also received a bullish 90% approval forecast, with their decisions expected in the fourth quarter. However, analysts assigned more cautious odds to ETFs based on Sui and Tron, estimating their chances at 60% and 50%, respectively. Unfortunately, the SEC continues to drag its feet on Ethereum-related products. On Monday, it postponed its decision on whether the Bitwise spot Ether ETF would be allowed to include staking. The regulator also delayed a separate ruling on the approval of the Osprey Bitcoin Trust for listing and trading. This proves that there is still some caution and regulatory hesitancy around certain crypto investment structures. First US Staked Crypto ETF Launches This Week Despite its delays with ETH products, the United States is still about to see the launch of its first-ever staked crypto ETF. Scheduled for debut on Wednesday, the REX-Osprey Solana and Staking ETF will provide investors with direct exposure to spot Solana (SOL) while also offering the opportunity to earn yield through staking. This unique combination is seen as a potential catalyst for even more institutional involvement in crypto investment products. The ETF's issuer, REX Shares, confirmed the launch just days after early reports hinted at its imminent arrival. The product is turning heads not only for being the first staked crypto ETF in the U., but also for navigating the very complex regulatory landscape. Initially, the SEC expressed concerns about the ETF‚Äôs C-Corporation structure, and suggested that it conflicted with existing ETF rules. However, after REX submitted an updated prospectus and made key adjustments, the SEC provided positive feedback, which then allowed the product to move forward. This development followed a May ruling by the SEC affirming that staking does not violate existing securities laws, although the agency still delayed decisions on other staking-related ETFs and altcoin funds. The REX-Osprey ETF could therefore serve as a benchmark for future products seeking similar structures. On the day of the ETF announcement, Solana‚Äôs price saw a good boost by climbing 6% to around $158 and pushing its seven-day gain to over 12%. Despite the upward momentum, SOL is still 48% below its all-time high from January. Still, with a market cap of $83.5 billion, Solana is now the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by valuation. SOL‚Äôs price action over the past week (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Solana's rising prominence is also reflected in its performance in the decentralized exchange (DEX) space. Recent data shows that Solana-based DEX volumes surpassed those of Ethereum, with platforms like Raydium, Pump.fun, and Orca leading the charge. This surge in DeFi activity, combined with the launch of a staking-enabled ETF, sheds some light on Solana‚Äôs growing influence in the crypto ecosystem. It also suggests that a new chapter of institutional and retail engagement may be unfolding. Crypto ETP Inflows Hit $17.8 Billion in H1 2025 Overall, cryptocurrency investment products continued their impressive momentum last week, with global exchange-traded products (ETPs) attracting $2.7 billion in new inflows. This was their 11th consecutive week of positive movement. The sustained streak pushed total net inflows for the first half of 2025 to $17.8 billion, according to a new report from digital asset manager CoinShares. Although slightly lower than the $18.3 billion that was recorded during the same period in 2024, the figure represents a resilient performance despite market fluctuations. Weekly crypto flows (Source: CoinShares ) Bitcoin investment products dominated the space by contributing $14.9 billion, or close to 84% of all inflows for the year-to-date period. In just the past week, Bitcoin ETPs brought in $2.2 billion, accounting for 83% of total inflows. Ethereum ETPs followed with a more modest but still impressive $429 million in weekly inflows, bringing their half-year total to $2.9 billion, or 16.3% of all inflows so far this year. Flows per asset (Source: CoinShares ) XRP also maintained its position among the top performers by recording $10.6 million in inflows last week and $219 million for the first half of the year. XRP‚Äôs strong showing is especially major when considering that spot XRP ETFs are still pending approval in the United States. However, Canada already moved forward, and launched these products on June 18, offering investors a regulated way to get exposure to the asset. From an issuer perspective, BlackRock emerged as the clear leader after pulling in over $17 billion in inflows during the first six months of 2025. This represents 96% of all new capital entering crypto ETPs over that time period. ProShares and Fidelity trailed with $526 million and $246 million, respectively, while Grayscale Investments saw nearly $1.7 billion in net outflows. The CoinShares report came as Bitcoin experienced a slight pullback , dipping just below $108,000 after a week-long rally that took it from around $101,000 on June 23 to nearly $107,800. Despite minor corrections, the continued inflows into crypto ETPs indicate robust investor confidence in digital assets.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9763/analysts-give-95-chance-for-solana-xrp-and-ltc-etf-approval,"SOL|XRP|LTC|TRADING|BTC","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin (BTC) recently hit a new all-time high of over $111,0000. All signs indicate that it is due for a massive pump in the next bull run. One reason for this optimistic forecast is growing institutional adoption. For instance, the US recently passed the GENIUS Act. Before that, Trump signed an executive order authorizing the creation of a Bitcoin Reserve. With all these positive developments around BTC, including greater legal clarity, the next bull run could see BTC gain 100%. However, it is worth noting that BTC is already trading at the top of its pricing. As such, a 100% gain may not come soon enough for most people. While you could hold on for years to come, there is a better option in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) A Deep Dive Into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in phase 5 of its presale, where tokens are going for $0.03. The current price represents a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. So far, over $11.3 million has been raised in the presale from around 12,550 unique buyers. The token price is set to increase by 16.67% in the upcoming phase 6 to $0.035. One reason why analysts are so confident of 100% gains for MUTM tokens is the planned listing price of $0.06. Based on that listing price, purchasing MUTM tokens already guarantees you a 100% return. In the upcoming phase 6, that return will dip to 71.43%. So far, investors have taken that calculation into consideration, buying up 50% of the tokens set aside for phase 5, barely a month after they went live. As such, analysts predict that MUTM tokens could rise more than 100%. Their predictions point to gains of 2300%. One reason why analysts are so optimistic about the future price of MUTM tokens is that the whole project is built on utility. Unlike meme coins, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed to support the continuous price increase of the native MUTM tokens. One unique design feature of this project is the buyback program. In this program, Mutuum Finance will use protocol profits to buy MUTM tokens off the open market. That will lead to huge price increases over time. Best of all, since the protocol has so much utility built into it, protocol profits are expected to keep rising over time. Bug Bounty Program Another reason why investors project such massive gains for MUTM tokens is the recent $50,000 USDT bug bounty program. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team has partnered with CertiK on this program. It will offer incentives to get the global security community to help maintain the safety of the ecosystem. The program will be split into four tiers, which are critical, major, minor, and low. Depending on the potential impact of a vulnerability, the team will share out a reward of the appropriate size. The Mutuum Finance Protocol Mutuum Finance is a decentralized noncustodial protocol where users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. As lenders, they deposit their assets into the protocol for the chance to receive interest on their deposits. Borrowers can deposit overcollateralized collateral into the protocol to access these funds. Interest rates for both lenders and borrowers are based on the pool utilization rate. For instance, when a lender deposits $10,000 USDC in a pool, the utilization rate could increase, pushing the yield to 12%. In such a case, the lender will earn $1,200 on their deposit per year. That presents an easy way to make passive income that does not require one to engage in complex trading strategies. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is The Top Crypto For Massive Returns While there are several crypto coins that could rise 100% or more in the next bull run, MUTM tokens offer the best possibility for massive returns. Analysts forecast a modest increase of 23x in returns when they go live. To be part of this massive opportunity, all you need to do is add MUTM tokens to your portfolio by participating in the ongoing presale.

In a new episode of the All-In Podcast, Palihapitiya takes a close look at the M2 money supply chart, which has been on the up and up. The billionaire notes that M2 growth is one of the key reasons why the S&P 500 is in the midst of a strong uptrend. ‚ÄúIf I was a betting man‚Ä¶ I think the free money trade here is to be levered long. I think you can make a lot of money right now. Why is that? The first chart I want to show you is the velocity of money‚Ä¶ This is the M2 money supply. It‚Äôs a measure of how much money is circulating in the economy. What this shows is the impact of rates, where we were able to start to slow down and contract the money supply. But then as the economy stabilized and people started to project what was possible in 18 to 24 months, you started to see money coming back into the system. That‚Äôs what has given a bid to the equity markets.‚Äù Source: FRED The billionaire is also keeping a close watch on the amount of money invested in money market funds, which are financial instruments that provide yields that are largely influenced by the prevailing interest rates set by the Federal Reserve. Palihapitiya says that once the Fed starts cutting rates, trillions of dollars in capital stashed in money market funds will likely be invested in the stock market. ‚ÄúLook at how much money is sitting in money market funds, and what this starts to show you is you have trillions of trillions of dollars of dry powder in the sidelines that will need to find a home. I think that [Fed chair] Jerome Powell is in an increasingly [untenable] situation because he will be looked at as politicizing the office of the Federal Reserve. There is enough data that can justify cutting rates. If you cut rates, two things will happen. Number one is people will take some amount of money out of the money market funds because they will want to go and seek superior returns somewhere else. It will increase the velocity of money at the same time. You put those two things together that is a bid to the equity markets. And so if we‚Äôre at an all-time high today with rates at 4.5% and Powell‚Äôs back is against the wall to cut, the only road from here is probably up‚Ä¶ I think if Powell starts an aggressive cutting program‚Ä¶ you could see the S&P 500 at 7,000.‚Äù Source: FRED As of Monday‚Äôs close, the S&P 500 is trading at record-high levels of 6,204.

2025-07-01T09:15:19,"Japanese gaming firm CyberStep plans to invest 1b yen into its new crypto arm","Japanese online claw machine operator CyberStep is launching a new business arm called CRYPTECH Capital which will generate tokens used to buy BTC and ETH as reserve assets. According to a recent report on CoinDesk Japan, the company that operates the online claw machine game ‚ÄúToreba‚Äù has established its own dedicated crypto stockpile firm to manage its corporate crypto holdings. The newly established branch is called ‚ÄúCRYPTECH Capital‚Äù and it is responsible for building a new revenue base for the company built with a web3 focus. Rather than issuing commercial shares or opening stock bids to generate revenue for a dedicated crypto treasury, CyberStep plans to adopt a new business strategy dubbed the ‚Äúself-circulating token economy‚Äù instead. As a starter, the company will allocate 200 million yen from its own funds as an initial purchasing budget in the fiscal year that ends in May 2026. Afterwards, the company plans to gradually increase the funds allocated to the strategic reserve to as much as 1 billion yen ($6.9 million). However, the firm stated that the plan is still subject to change depending on market conditions. You might also like: Japanese fashion brand ANAP buys more Bitcoin ahead of 1,000 BTC goal The strategy involves CyberStep creating and promoting their own in-game tokens from the company‚Äôs web3 game services. The generated native token stockpile will then be exchanged for major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ). The major tokens will be stored within the company‚Äôs balance sheets and classified under ‚Äúcorporate assets.‚Äù An example of a ‚Äúself-circulating token‚Äù created by the gaming firm include the Eggle Energy token $ENG that was launched by the firm last April. The tokens were part of a larger venture that involved a blockchain game called Eggle and an NFT line in the works. In addition to Eggle Energy tokens, CyberStep‚Äôs Cryptech Capital also plans to invest in promising meme coins and other web3 gaming tokens in the crypto space. ‚ÄúThe company plans to achieve both capital gains from rising asset prices and income gains through staking and providing liquidity to DeFi protocols across its portfolio,‚Äù wrote the company in its translated press release. Most recently, the Swedish gaming firm Fragbite also released plans to establish its own crypto stockpile. However, the focus would lie mostly on Bitcoins as the sole reserve asset, investing some of its corporate funds into acquiring BTC.

That may not be the only reason for their popularity, however. The stocks all offer yields above the Federal Reserve's target rate of 4.25%-4.5% at levels that may be enough to attract investor interest, especially given President Donald Trump's calls for U.S. interest rates to be lowered. While the official announcement regarding S&P 500 inclusion is not due until September. Still, on Monday, MSTR rose 5%, pushing the stock above $400, its highest since May 22. More notable gains came from the perpetual preferred shares, STRK, which climbed 15% and STRF, which added 7.5%. The STRD shares rose 3%. Bitcoin BTC ended June at $107,750, a level that translates into a positive earnings impact of about $11 billion for Tyson Corner, Virgina-based Strategy, and boosts earnings per share to around $39.50, according to MSTR analyst J eff Walton . That's enough for it to post a net positive figure from the most recent four quarters, the last barrier it faced to be added to the S&P 500. Shares often rise when they join, or are expected to join, the benchmark because membership opens up greater demand from institutions who are not allowed to invest in companies that haven't made the cut. STRK's advance pushed the price to $121 with an effective yield of 6.6%. Since its Feb. 6 launch, STRK has delivered a 42% return, outperforming both bitcoin's 11% jump and the S&P 500's 2%. The figures exclude dividend payments associated with these products. STRF now offers an effective yield of 8.8% and STRD 11.1%. Altogether, these developments raise the question of whether recent market moves represent front running ahead of a possible inclusion of MSTR in the S&P 500 alone.

With over $500,000 in inflows on June 27th alone and a total of $16.1m raised so far at only $0.0437, early backers are eyeing generational gains. Rumors are now swirling around further tier-1 exchange listings, which could be confirmed as early as July 31st, when the team drops its next major announcement. The last three updates (on June 1st,17th, and 30th) brought in over $1M combined, and all delivered visible progress. Many now expect this next announcement to change everything, possibly more official listing information or a large-scale partner activation‚ÄîBinance and Coinbase rumors are persisting. Visit the official website now for the latest updates‚Äînothing in the Bitcoin world will remain the same after this. Bitcoin Pepe is building a Solana-like L2 on Bitcoin Bitcoin Pepe is introducing two innovations: a new token standard (PEP-20) and a custom Layer 2 built for memes, NFTs, and low-gas trading. Both are designed to make Bitcoin a serious home for the kind of activity that usually happens on Solana, Base, or Ethereum. PEP-20 acts like Ethereum's ERC-20, but on Bitcoin. That means creators, developers, and meme makers can finally issue tokens on BTC in a native, permissionless way without workarounds or third-party bridges. Until now, there‚Äôs never been an open standard for meme asset creation on the network. Bitcoin Pepe‚Äôs layer 2 is where it all comes to life. It‚Äôs built to handle fast transactions, low fees, wallet compatibility, and a much better UI than anything Bitcoin meme builders have had access to before. Bitcoin Pepe price prediction: Is this the last chance to buy low? With Bitcoin Pepe‚Äôs next announcement now just hours away, price predictions are getting wild. This may be the last window to grab BPEP at only $0.0437 before it gets snatched up on major exchanges. The BitMart listing announcement on June 30th alone created nearly $300K of buy pressure, and the July 31st announcement is expected to unlock a wave of new volume, visibility, and exchange access. After the first staking pool sold out, a new pool was released with 1.5 million BPEP tokens and a 15,000% APY. This is going to move quickly, especially as insiders are hinting at listings from top-tier exchanges. That means visibility, liquidity, and price action. A flood of new users could send BPEP soaring right out of the gate. In the meantime, Bitcoin Pepe has been stacking partnerships that expand its utility, exposure, and credibility. The most recent one, Me3 , just onboarded BPEP into its AI-driven Web3 portal with over 300,000 users and 200,000+ social followers. The relationship adds smart onboarding, viral boost, and access to a highly active base of crypto-native users. On social media, BPEP is dominating. Top X influencers are flooding timelines, praising the design, speed, and upcoming announcement potential. With Bitcoin on track for a new ATH , BPEP could be the breakout 100x alt of this BTC cycle. Stakes are rising before the Bitcoin Pepe launch New exchanges are now onboard, and Bitcoin Pepe is trending #1 on X as the hype swells to a boiling point. Bitcoin Pepe is about to do something no meme has ever done before: tap into Bitcoin‚Äôs untouched liquidity and inject it with full-on degen energy. With BitMart‚Äôs listing already generating $300k of buy pressure and only hours left before the next announcement, timing is everything. With the July 31st listing bombshell just weeks away, every clue says this will be the biggest update yet. Lock in a stake ahead of a potential Bitcoin-powered cultural reset.

Bitcoin Pepe just cracked $16.1m as $500k flowed in on June 27 alone. MEXC will list Bitcoin Pepe immediately after the presale, following Bitmart‚Äôs earlier listing announcement on June 17, which triggered a separate $300k surge in funding. The project introduces PEP-20, Bitcoin‚Äôs first native token standard for open asset issuance. With staking pools filling rapidly, leaked demo images, and the final announcement coming July 31, the stakes are growing each day. To follow updates or participate, the official website is the only place to go. Bitcoin Pepe: First-mover on Bitcoin Bitcoin Pepe‚Äôs layer 2 is being built directly on Bitcoin. It‚Äôs launching core infrastructure to enable tokenized meme culture at the base level of crypto‚Äôs most recognized chain. Central to that is PEP-20, a new token standard designed to allow anyone to issue assets directly on Bitcoin. Interface previews show a clean wallet bridge that lets users move BTC to the Layer 2 and receive BPEP tokens. The bridge includes real-time compatibility warnings, basic safety checks, and a clear, minimal interface for faster onboarding. Bitcoin Pepe filled its new staking pool in minutes, a detail that speaks more to market conviction than any marketing campaign could. Early backers are now directly tied to the system‚Äôs security and utility through locked assets, incentivizing long-term holding rather than speculative flipping. Bitcoin Pepe price outlook: Here‚Äôs how BPEP went viral Historically, when asset issuance becomes accessible, like ERC-20 did for Ethereum, the volume of economic activity explodes. With PEP-20, Bitcoin finally gets a simple, extensible foundation for permissionless token creation. Early momentum has been consistent. The first staking pool filled in under 10 minutes, and now a second pool has launched, offering 1.5 million tokens at 15,000 APY%, and is already seeing rapid uptake. Such activity proves deep demand but also deeper potential illiquidity: once tokens are locked, circulating supply tightens, and pricing can dislocate fast. The Bitcoin Pepe layer 2 leaks show a working bridge, DEX, and explorer; PEP-20 is defined, and the project has now announced nine partnerships across gaming, DeFi, and content ecosystems. This includes Me3, which will integrate Bitcoin Pepe‚Äôs Layer 2 with AI onboarding and user conversion tools, bringing 300,000 active users and over a million monthly interactions into direct contact with BPEP. With MEXC now confirmed and Bitmart already onboard, Bitcoin Pepe is preparing for its first listings after the presale closes. The T1 listing on MEXC puts BPEP in front of a large, active trading base with deep liquidity and no presale requirements. Buyers won‚Äôt need to bridge, swap, or use unfamiliar tools; they‚Äôll be able to buy directly. When BPEP goes live, latecomers will be fighting over limited supply. Social activity has spiked across every major crypto platform, particularly X , where multiple independent analysts flagged BPEP as the ‚ÄúSolana moment‚Äù for Bitcoin.

2025-07-01T09:01:27,"Best crypto to buy now as Trump-linked American Bitcoin raises $220M","The cryptocurrency market traded mostly lower on Tuesday, with Bitcoin hovering near $107,000 mark as traders remained on edge ahead of the July 9 US tariff deadline. Market sentiment appeared mixed , with altcoins showing divergent trends amid lingering macroeconomic uncertainty. However, Bitcoin‚Äôs performance over the past few months has been resilient. Bitcoin registered a strong monthly close in June, with a candle settling just above $107,000‚Äîthe highest on record. That follows prior monthly highs in May and January, which closed around $104,600 and $102,450, respectively. The latest close marks the third consecutive monthly gain and continues a broader rebound from Bitcoin‚Äôs April lows near $75,000. Bitcoin‚Äôs resilient performance has helped improve sentiment across the broader market. The positive sentiment is also seen in the early-stage project, Bitcoin Pepe . Trump-linked American Bitcoin raises $220 million American Bitcoin, the newly launched mining venture backed by Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., has raised $220 million through a private placement, according to a recent SEC filing . The funding round, disclosed by majority stakeholder Hut 8, involved the issuance and sale of over 11 million new shares to private investors last Friday. Notably, approximately $10 million worth of the shares were purchased using Bitcoin, at an exchange rate of $104,000 per BTC. ‚ÄúThe Company intends to use the net proceeds to fund its strategic and Bitcoin accumulation goals, which may include, but are not limited to, the purchase of Bitcoin and/or miners,‚Äù the filing stated. After deducting fees and expenses, American Bitcoin netted roughly $215 million. The venture officially launched in late March as a joint initiative between Hut 8 and American Data Centers, a firm tied to the Trump family. The move deepens the Trumps‚Äô involvement in digital assets, aligning with the president‚Äôs broader push to establish US leadership in blockchain and crypto infrastructure. Bitcoin Pepe continues to see strong interest As Bitcoin maintains its position above key technical support levels, institutional participation continues to underpin broader market confidence. The relative calm is prompting investors to shift capital into higher-risk assets, with meme coins seeing a renewed surge in inflows. One of the standout beneficiaries of this trend is Bitcoin Pepe, a meme-themed project that diverges from traditional tokens in the category by offering an infrastructure-driven roadmap. Positioned as the first meme-centric Layer 2 on the Bitcoin network, the project aims to integrate the base-layer security of Bitcoin with the speed and scalability features typically associated with Solana. Describing itself as an initiative to ‚Äúbuild Solana on Bitcoin,‚Äù Bitcoin Pepe is attempting to differentiate through technology rather than purely community engagement. The project introduces its own token standard and infrastructure layer to support on-chain activity, a notable deviation from meme tokens that trade solely on social momentum. The project‚Äôs presale has raised $16.2 million, with investor interest accelerating as the token offering nears completion. According to the development team, the BPEP token is scheduled to be listed on both MEXC and BitMart, two centralised exchanges that could improve trading access and liquidity. A final listing announcement is expected on July 31, adding to the anticipation surrounding the project‚Äôs final presale stages.

However, analysts at Bitfinex noted on Monday that, for the first time during this uptrend, ‚Äúmomentum has begun to fade.‚Äù The report pointed out that onchain metrics and order flow data suggest Bitcoin might now be heading into a period of consolidation or reaching a local top, instead of continuing its ‚Äúvertical acceleration.‚Äù Spot volume has cooled, taker buy pressure has weakened, and profit-taking has picked up ‚Äî especially among short-term holders who have benefited from the rally from sub-$80,000 levels. ETF Inflows Continue but Macro Factors Remain Key Despite the short-term cooling, Bitcoin‚Äôs next move will hinge on macroeconomic developments and sustained institutional demand, particularly from spot Bitcoin ETFs. US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs have posted inflows for 14 consecutive trading days since June 9, totaling $4.63 billion in net inflows by June 27, according to data from Farside Investors. Economist Timothy Peterson described last week‚Äôs $2.2 billion ETF inflows as ‚Äúmassive‚Äù and expects the trend to continue this week, adding there is a ‚Äú70% chance next week will be positive too, which generally correlates to upward price pressure.‚Äù Additionally, market participants are closely monitoring the Federal Reserve‚Äôs interest rate decision on July 30, with lower rates typically providing a bullish backdrop for crypto markets. According to the CME FedWatch tool, markets currently see a 19% chance of a rate cut at the meeting. Long-Term Holders Seen as Key to Resuming Uptrend While uncertainty clouds Bitcoin‚Äôs short-term direction, analysts remain optimistic about the broader market structure, emphasizing that higher time frame support levels are holding. ‚ÄúThe current data points to a transition phase,‚Äù the Bitfinex report noted, indicating a likely period of consolidation before the next major move. Economist Donald Dean remains bullish, stating , ‚ÄúBitcoin is getting ready to move higher with tight consolidation at the volume shelf.‚Äù Meanwhile, Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards pointed out that long-term holders, or ‚ÄúBitcoin OGs,‚Äù have been ‚Äúdumping on Wall Street‚Äù since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, preventing prices from breaking out sustainably above the $100,000 level despite institutional demand.

Key Takeaways: Sparkassen will launch crypto trading for 50 million customers by summer 2026. Dekabank will manage the new service, enabling Bitcoin and Ether trades directly in Sparkassen‚Äôs app. The move signals growing momentum among German banks to integrate crypto. According to Bloomberg , Dekabank, owned by Sparkassen, will oversee the crypto offering through the group‚Äôs mobile banking app, enabling direct trading of Bitcoin and Ether. The German Savings Banks Association (DSGV) confirmed the move, stating it will provide customers with ‚Äúreliable access to a regulated crypto offering,‚Äù now allowed under the EU‚Äôs MiCA framework, which took effect in December. Sparkassen Reverses Course After 2015 Crypto Ban Over Volatility Fears Sparkassen‚Äôs leadership had previously rejected crypto services due to volatility concerns and even blocked crypto purchases for all customers in 2015. While the group has changed course, the DSGV stressed its caution, labeling cryptocurrencies ‚Äúhighly speculative investments‚Äù and promising no marketing campaigns for the new feature. Customers will instead receive detailed information about risks, including the chance of total losses. Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe spans more than 500 financial institutions, including over 370 savings banks, and manages over ‚Ç¨2.5 trillion ($2.9 trillion) in assets, giving the crypto initiative significant potential reach. Industry voices have welcomed the move. ERA Labs CEO Filipp Bolotov called it a ‚Äúbig move for mainstream adoption,‚Äù while Master Ventures‚Äô Kyle Chasse said it shows banks are ‚Äúcatching up‚Äù to crypto‚Äôs evolution.

THE BANKS ARE CATCHING UP!!! pic.twitter.com/rrykogR1Tl ‚Äî Kyle Chass√© / DD (@kyle_chasse) June 30, 2025 Other major German banks have already begun integrating crypto services. DZ Bank, Germany‚Äôs second-largest lender, partnered with Boerse Stuttgart Digital last year to pilot crypto trading and custody services, aiming to expand offerings across its 700 cooperative banks after initial trials. Meanwhile, Landesbank Baden-W√ºrttemberg, the country‚Äôs biggest federal bank, announced plans in April 2024 to provide crypto custody services for institutional clients in collaboration with Bitpanda. The momentum isn‚Äôt limited to Germany. Speaking in April, Eric Trump warned that banks resisting crypto could become obsolete within a decade, highlighting issues of speed and cost in traditional finance. And during Paris Blockchain Week, Messari‚Äôs Eric Turner and Sygnum Bank‚Äôs Thomas Eichenberger predicted a deeper push by banks into crypto services later this year as regulatory clarity improves. Ric Edelman Urges Advisors to Allocate Up to 40% to Crypto As reported, veteran advisor Ric Edelman is calling for crypto allocations of up to 40% in investment portfolios, a dramatic jump from his earlier 1% guidance. He told CNBC that questions around government bans and institutional adoption have been resolved, making crypto a mainstream asset. Edelman pointed to strong inflows into Bitcoin ETFs as evidence of crypto‚Äôs acceptance among investors and advisors. He said the traditional 60/40 stock-bond portfolio no longer suits today‚Äôs longer life expectancies, requiring strategies with higher return potential. Edelman also pointed out crypto‚Äôs uncorrelated performance with traditional assets, arguing that it can provide essential diversification and boost risk-adjusted returns.

Specifically, the number of large Bitcoin transactions exceeding $100,000 has decreased by 45.3% over the past month. The transactions peaked at around 30,840 on May 22 but fell to just 16,860 by June 29, according to data from the crypto analytics platform IntoTheBlock . Bitcoin whale transaction data. Source: IntoTheBlock The steep decline often signals reduced activity from whales and institutions. This drop indicates potential weakening confidence and thinning liquidity, which increases the risk of Bitcoin slipping below the key $100,000 support level . If large-scale buying continues to wane, the market could face deeper volatility unless new demand emerges. Capital inflow into crypto plunges $20 billion At the same time, broader cryptocurrency market trends echo this caution. Capital inflows into cryptocurrencies have declined by more than $20 billion, suggesting a shift in investor sentiment. Glassnode data shows the net position change in realized value, a measure of capital entering or exiting the market, dropped from nearly $55 billion in late May to $34 billion by June 28.

Source: Glassnode This drawdown highlights a slowdown in momentum across major assets, including Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH ), both of which had experienced steady accumulation earlier in the second quarter. Bitcoin price analysis Currently, Bitcoin‚Äôs key support level is at $105,000. Holding above this level is critical for any attempt to reclaim $110,000 and push toward new all-time highs .

However, Bitfinex analysts said the Bitcoin rally was losing momentum as profit-taking increased and volume decreased. Uptrend Momentum Weakening! Bitcoin‚Äôs nearly three-month rally appears to be losing momentum as buying pressure weakens and profit-taking intensifies, Bitfinex analysts said. Although BTC has surged 40% from its April lows to above $107,000, analysts argued that the market has entered a consolidation phase rather than continuing its sharp uptrend. Analysts claimed that falling Bitcoin spot volume is entering a period of consolidation rather than sustained bullish momentum and could signal a local top. As Bitcoin loses its upward momentum, analysts said that BTC's next move will depend on macro factors and institutional demand, especially from ETF inflows. ‚ÄúFor the first time in Bitcoin‚Äôs nearly three-month-old uptrend, momentum has begun to fade.
