2025-07-01T16:55:45,"‘It Sounded Reasonable at the Time’ – Elderly JPMorgan Chase Customer Duped out of $13,000 by Contest Scam: Report","An elderly JPMorgan Chase customer is out thousands of dollars after scammers convinced him he won a big prize. An 87-year-old man from Portland, Oregon, lost a total of $13,000 to scammers who told him he needed to pay them money to receive hundreds of thousands of dollars and a new SUV, reports the NBC-affiliated KGW8. The victim, whose name was not provided, says he received a call one morning from a man claiming he won a Publishers Clearing House prize. “[He said] that I won second prize. Second prize is $850,000 and $150,000 in cash. And additionally, I was going to [get] a Mercedes SUV.” However, the victim says he was told he had to meet someone at his bank and hand over money to receive it. He says he followed the instructions and was met by a thief who walked with him into a Chase Bank branch in Northwest Portland. “I said, how much money do you need? He said $10,000. I said, what’s that for? He said, well, we need people to insure the car, give it license plates, install the plates. It sounded reasonable at the time.” The scam didn’t stop there. He says the thief got him to come back later that day and withdraw another $1,500, as well as go to CVS to buy three $500 gift cards. However, he says that when his wife, Iris, came home and he told her about the situation, she realized he had been scammed. She says the bank teller should have figured out her husband may have been a victim of fraud before letting him withdraw the funds. Says Iris, “When I got home he said, ‘I have good news for you. We won Publishers Clearing House. We’re going to get a big check.’ After that, I had a meltdown. None of this would have happened if the teller had called a manager. None of this would have happened, and it’s not like he looks like a young man. There was a man, like, shadowing him.” A Chase Bank spokesperson says the firm is looking into the matter. The Portland Police are also investigating. Says the victim, “I used to be a very bright guy, and I feel very stupid now having bought this.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-01T16:44:09,"In the Last Three Months, Companies Bought Way More Bitcoin Than ETFs – What Does This Mean? Experts Explain","Institutional interest in Bitcoin is shifting. Public companies are buying more Bitcoin than exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the third quarter in a row, continuing to embrace the strategy pioneered by MicroStrategy. According to Bitcoin Treasuries data, public companies purchased approximately 131,000 BTC in the second quarter of 2025, increasing their total assets by 18%, while ETFs purchased 111,000 BTC in the same period, with an 8% growth. According to Nick Marie, research director at Ecoinometrics, the motivation for companies to buy Bitcoin is quite different from ETF investors: “These companies accumulate BTC with the goal of increasing shareholder value. They are more focused on the amount of BTC in their vaults than the price level.” Marie noted that public companies increased their Bitcoin holdings by 4% in April, while this increase in ETFs remained at 2% during the same period. During this period, the market was volatile due to President Donald Trump’s first tariff announcements. Although ETFs are still the largest institutional Bitcoin investors with a total of 1.4 million BTC (6.8% of the maximum supply), the amount held by public companies has reached 855,000 BTC (4%). This trend also coincides with the regulatory easing seen in the cryptocurrency sector during the Trump administration. An executive order signed in March announced the creation of the official US Bitcoin reserve. The last time ETFs bought more BTC from public companies was in the third quarter of 2024, before Trump’s re-election. Some notable company moves in the second quarter also drew attention: GameStop adopted Bitcoin as a reserve asset with the approval of its board of directors and began purchasing it. Health technology company KindlyMD merged with Bitcoin investment company Nakamoto. Famous investor Anthony Pompliano’s company ProCap launched its own BTC purchasing program while entering the process of going public via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). Related News: BREAKING: Historic Change Claimed to Completely Clear the Way for Altcoin Spot ETFs on the SEC The pioneer of this trend and still the largest representative, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) is in the lead with 597,000 BTC. It is followed by Bitcoin mining company Mara Holdings with around 50,000 BTC. Ben Werkman, investment director at Swan Bitcoin, notes that Strategy’s scale will not be easy to catch up with: “They will continue to be an attractive destination for institutional capital due to their high liquidity.” By contrast, Werkman said smaller companies offer high-yield potential for individual investors and small-cap funds. These companies have the capacity to accumulate Bitcoin on a scale that individual investors cannot, thanks to their access to public capital markets. Nick Marie, on the other hand, thinks that this trend may not be long-lasting: “After 10 years, the number of companies that adhere to this strategy may have decreased. Because as the category expands, the impact of individual companies will be diluted. Also, BTC may have completely normalized by then.” Investor interest remains strong. These companies offer attractive leveraged investment vehicles for investors who already believe in Bitcoin, according to Werkman. “These companies offer not just Bitcoin, but Bitcoin-backed appreciation backed by operating income. That’s what makes them unique,” he says. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: In the Last Three Months, Companies Bought Way More Bitcoin Than ETFs – What Does This Mean?

With momentum stalling and an ABC corrective pattern potentially forming, a retracement appears likely. Following a strong rally, Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) has run into a technically significant resistance zone. The $41.55 level marks a prior horizontal resistance that now aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, forming what is commonly referred to as the Golden Pocket. Price action is showing signs of hesitation here, suggesting the impulsive leg may have completed and a corrective phase could be underway. Key technical points, $41.55 Resistance Zone: Golden Pocket Fibonacci confluence with previous high Corrective Structure Forming: Signs of an ABC retracement following completed Elliott Wave 5 $26.53 Support Region: High time frame support and next Fibonacci level below current price HYPE/USDT (1D) Chart | Source: TradingView From a technical perspective, the impulsive breakout in HYPER appears to have reached exhaustion after completing a five-wave Elliott structure. The current stall under $41.55— a level that has acted as both resistance and a Fibonacci retracement — is a typical topping behavior before a correction. Price has now entered a consolidation phase, which aligns with the beginning of an ABC corrective structure. You might also like: XRP ETF buzz boosts XYZVerse presale momentum as investors eye a potential breakout If this structure plays out, price may begin retracing toward the next key support near $26.53, which coincides with both a lower Fibonacci level and high time frame demand. This level also aligns with prior market structure and serves as an ideal candidate for a macro higher low, allowing the broader bullish trend to remain intact while resetting momentum indicators. Notably, the current move does not show signs of aggressive selling or breakdown — rather, the market is rotating sideways under resistance. This supports the idea that the correction, if it unfolds, may be orderly and offer a chance for accumulation. Unless bulls reclaim the $41.55 zone with strong volume, the path of least resistance remains to the downside for now. What to expect in the coming price action If Hyperliquid fails to reclaim $41.55, a pullback toward the $26.53 support region is likely. This correction would be considered structurally bullish as long as support holds and a higher low is formed. Traders should watch for either an increase in volume near support or a breakout through resistance to confirm the next directional move.

This move is integral for Deutsche Bank’s effort to grow in the digital asset market. Deutsche Bank Pushes Effort to Grow in the Crypto Market Sources also confirmed that Bitpanda’s technology team is assisting in building the bank’s storage system for digital assets. This collaboration aims to provide safe storage and management for institutional clients who hold cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. Furthermore, the custody service will meet Germany’s strict regulatory standards, ensuring a high level of security and transparency. Notably, Deutsche Bank’s long-time partner, Taurus, is also involved in this initiative. They will help develop and implement the custody platform. Together, Bitpanda and Taurus aim to create a strong and scalable custody solution. Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank’s new launch comes amid a growing need for regulated crypto services in Europe. Deutsche Börse Enters Into the Crypto Custody Sector In a similar vein, Clearstream, a subsidiary of Deutsche Börse, entered the crypto industry. The company launched a new custody service for institutional investors , enabling them to invest in the digital asset market. This move marked a significant step for Clearstream in strengthening its position in the cryptocurrency market. As reported by TheCoinRise, this service initially supports Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Later on, more cryptocurrencies will be added. It is worth noting that institutional clients now have access to the new service, which provides custody and settlement for digital assets. Clearstream relies on its majority-owned subsidiary, Crypto Finance, to ensure secure handling to manage sub-custody operations. Beyond Compliance: Deutsche Bank’s Growing Crypto Influence Interestingly, the financial giant’s ambition is growing daily. The company has actively forged strategic partnerships in the crypto sector. Recently, it joined forces with Keyrock to enhance the crypto-native market maker’s global services and expand its reach in key regions. Likewise, Deutsche Bank has consistently advocated for blockchain technology to address financial sector challenges, such as margin compression. In 2019, the financial bank joined JPMorgan’s blockchain-based Interbank Information Network . The move reinforced the bank’s role as a leader in adopting blockchain to enhance efficiency and transparency in banking operations.

However, rally expectations for BTC and altcoins remain alive. At this point, Bitwise announced its expectations for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) for 2025. According to The Block, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan updated their 10 predictions for 2025 in a note to their customers. Hougan first stated that there was no change in his Bitcoin prediction and that they maintained their $200,000 target for BTC. While Bitwise expects BTC to reach new highs and eventually $200,000 by the end of 2025, the same has not been true for ETH and SOL. “We remain true to our $200,000 BTC forecast as we expect institutional demand for BTC to be greater from 2024, further driving the BTC price higher. However, we are less confident that Ethereum and Solana will rally and reach new ATHs. However, we expect that the increasing interest in stablecoins, ETF approvals, and the emergence of ETH and SOL treasury companies could push prices significantly higher.” Bitwise announced that in its predictions at the beginning of the year, they set a target of $7,000 for Ethereum and $750 for Solana. Current Status of Predictions! Bitwise CIO listed the latest status of their predictions at the beginning of 2025 as follows: “Prediction 1: Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana are expected to reach new all-time highs and Bitcoin is expected to trade above $200,000. – Still valid for Bitcoin but some hesitations for ETH and SOL. Prediction 2: Bitcoin ETFs will attract more inflows in 2025 than in 2024. – Still valid. Prediction 3: Coinbase will surpass Charles Schwab as the world's most valuable brokerage firm, with its stock price exceeding $700.- It seems unlikely. Prediction #4: 2025 will be the “Year of the Crypto IPO” with at least five crypto unicorns going public in the US – Still valid. Prediction #5: AI-driven token launches will lead to a bigger memecoin craze than in 2024. -Very Low Probability given. Prediction #6: Number of countries with Bitcoin will increase from 9 to 18. -Update: Unlikely. Prediction 7: Coinbase will enter the S&P 500 and MicroStrategy will enter the Nasdaq-100, thus providing cryptocurrency inflow to the portfolio of (almost) every US investor.- It came true. Prediction #8: The U.S. Department of Labor will loosen its guidance against crypto in 401(k) plans, sending billions of dollars into crypto assets.- Come true. Prediction 9: With the passage of long-awaited stablecoin legislation in the US, stablecoin assets will double to $400 billion – it is still too early to reach this goal. Prediction #10: As Wall Street’s crypto adoption intensifies, the value of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) will exceed $50 billion. – Still valid.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-01T16:00:29,"Crypto CEO Had a Vision about What Will Happen to XRP Once Bitcoin Finally Collapses","Edo Farina, the CEO of Alpha Lions Academy and a prominent voice in the XRP community, has shared a thought-provoking vision on X that is now stirring discussion across the crypto space. In his post, Farina predicted a dramatic collapse of Bitcoin, one that would send shockwaves throughout the entire crypto market. But what sets his vision apart is what he believes happens next: XRP, after briefly crashing with the rest of the market, will become the focal point of a new era in digital finance. According to Farina, Bitcoin’s eventual downfall is inevitable. He envisions it triggering a widespread crash where all assets, including XRP, initially suffer. Specifically, he foresees XRP briefly dipping to as low as $0.77 before making a swift and powerful recovery. “The lowest XRP will ever reach is a wick to $0.77 before quickly bouncing back,” he wrote. I had a vision. When BTC finally collapses, the entire market will crash, including $XRP , but only temporarily. The lowest XRP will ever reach is a wick to 0.77$ before quickly bouncing back From the ashes, the Phoenix will rise, and all liquidity will flow into XRP. — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) June 30, 2025 XRP as the Phoenix Rising Farina’s symbolic language casts XRP as the Phoenix, rising from the ashes of Bitcoin’s collapse. This isn’t just about price action; it’s about a complete market restructuring. He claims that once the dust settles, liquidity from across the digital asset ecosystem will begin flowing into XRP, positioning it as the new foundation of the crypto economy. This imagery mirrors long-standing theories that XRP is designed to become a global bridge currency, particularly in institutional finance. The Phoenix metaphor also taps into a widely circulated theory stemming from a 1988 Economist magazine cover, which predicted a “world currency” rising from the ashes of fiat by 2018. While the timeline didn’t materialize, many XRP supporters have adopted the Phoenix concept as a symbol of XRP’s long-term destiny. Not Financial Advice, But a Track Record to Watch In a follow-up post, Farina tempered his message: “Don’t take this as financial advice or too seriously, just a vision I wanted to share. Many of my past visions have already come true.” Though he distances himself from offering official investment guidance, his followers are quick to point out that previous predictions he made have aligned closely with major market events. This blend of intuition and perceived foresight is part of what gives his statements such weight in the XRP community. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Question of Bitcoin’s Sustainability Farina’s vision is rooted in a growing skepticism about Bitcoin’s long-term viability . Critics frequently point to Bitcoin’s energy consumption, limited transaction speed, and lack of direct utility as potential Achilles’ heels. If regulatory scrutiny or technological evolution renders these flaws unsustainable, Bitcoin’s dominance, currently over 50% of the total crypto market cap, could falter. Farina suggests that in such a moment of weakness, investors and institutions may shift toward utility-driven assets like XRP. A Speculative Yet Compelling Outlook Though Farina’s statements are speculative, they resonate with the hopes and convictions of XRP supporters who believe the asset is still undervalued and misunderstood. His vision doesn’t merely forecast a price rally; it imagines XRP as the cornerstone of a restructured financial ecosystem, built from the ruins of Bitcoin’s collapse. Whether seen as prophecy, bold speculation, or metaphorical insight, his post has reignited the debate about what truly comes next for crypto—and for XRP in particular.

Higher lows for altcoins, but previous bull market high must be surpassed Source: TradingView The weekly chart for Total2 (combined market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies excluding $BTC) shows a series of higher lows since the bull market began in early January 2023. This has not been broken, even during the big 49% correction from December 2024 through to April 2025. An ascending trendline has also continued to be respected throughout this bull market, and big horizontal support levels are doing their job thus far. Be that as it may, the current altcoin bull market has still not equaled the highs of the last bull market that topped in November 2021. That $1.7 trillion top will need to be surpassed if the altcoins are going to continue to climb higher in successive bull markets. That said, perhaps things will begin to change now. In all probability, at least 99% of the current crop of altcoins are likely to go to zero, given the real lack of proper use cases. Bitcoin dominance just keeps going up Source: TradingView The Bitcoin dominance chart (BTC.D) illustrates just how difficult things have been for the altcoins, even from before the start of the bull market. An inexorable rise in Bitcoin dominance was only punctuated by one big 11% swing back to the altcoins in November 2024. Other than that, the trend has been upward. 68% and then 70% dominance levels could be next. Some of the best altcoins will outperform With all this said, there are very likely going to be certain altcoins that will not only have their boats floated by the rising tide of Bitcoin, but they may outperform the king of the cryptocurrencies into the bargain. Why could they do this? The main reason is the vastly inferior market caps compared with $BTC. The $ETH market cap is around 7x less, while the $SOL market cap is only $79 billion, compared with $BTC’s $2.12 trillion. Other layer 1s and fundamentally good altcoins have an even greater disparity compared with Bitcoin. Therefore, the cream of the altcoins (perhaps with some of the hot air memecoins) could make much bigger percentage gains than Bitcoin, going into this potentially last stage of the bull market. In order to take advantage of these outperformers, it’s not about watching how they perform against a weakening USD pair, it’s about carefully measuring how they square up to their BTC pairs. Look for breaks of trend against BTC, and bounces from strong support levels. If your particular altcoins are not beating $BTC, they just aren’t worth holding on to.

The new exchange is fully compliant with MiCAR requirements, with no obstacles to trading digital assets in the Euro Area. Bybit officially launched Bybit.eu , a platform specifically dedicated to traders from the European Economic Area (EEA). The new platform launched about a month after Bybit secured a MiCAR license , allowing it to offer services compliant with EU regulations. JUST IN: @Bybit_Official set to launch a MiCAR-compliant crypto-trading platform in Vienna, Austria, and across 29 EEA countries. pic.twitter.com/QuHHHtmJJC — Cryptopolitan (@CPOfficialtx) July 1, 2025 Bybit.eu will be operated under Bybit EU GmbH, a fully licensed Crypto-Asset Service Provider under the current MiCA regulations. The launch of a European platform is a milestone for Bybit, which already has a significant global presence. ‘ Bybit.eu is our long-term commitment to Europe, ’ said Mazurka Zeng, managing director and CEO of Bybit EU GmbH. ‘ Europe deserves a world-class crypto gateway that balances technology with robust regulatory standards. That’s exactly what Bybit EU delivers. ’ The market operator will have its headquarters in Vienna, Austria, and will branch out to 29 potential markets, offering crypto access to over 450M Europeans. Currently, the EU market is fragmented, with smaller local platforms and additional access to some of the larger market operators. A full MiCAR license also means no surprising shocks to trading, and a certainty that all traded crypto assets have passed the compliance requirements. Bybit tailors its services to European users The new trading platform is compliant with all requirements for investor protection, transparent reporting, and capital reserves. Bybit.eu offers a brokerage service with deep liquidity from multiple partnering markets. The European site taps the available liquidity from multiple sources, tapping tools backed by Bybit’s global scale. The platform will also be localized in several major European languages. Support will be available 24/7 with live assistance in English, Polish, Portuguese, and Spanish, with upcoming rollouts in German, French, Italian, and Romanian. The company will also open regional offices in several European countries. Bybit.eu will also offer VIP accounts for high-volume traders, crypto custody, and reward and incentive programs, all of which are compliant with EU requirements. The products will be available to all EEA markets except for Malta. Bybit to tap local blockchain talent Bybit aims to build on Europe’s wider acceptance of crypto. The platform will invest in local communities and tap EU-based talent. Bybit.eu aims to serve as a trusted partner for blockchain developers, institutions, and end users. The exchange aims to help Europe shape the future of digital finance. Bybit has stated it aims to become a catalyst for wider crypto adoption in Europe. The European platform will exist as a separate entity, as Bybit currently runs a signup campaign. For now, European users can still access their global program accounts, but some are calling to create special new accounts on Bybit.eu . Existing users can use their current global Bybit identity to register and prepare to fulfill the KYC requirements. Current Bybit traders from the EU are advised to close all positions and prepare to transfer to the new platform, which will separate EU-based traders from the global platform.

With a half-billion-dollar war chest and heavyweight backers, the company is making an audacious play to dominate corporate Bitcoin holdings. In a press release on July 1, NYSE-listed DDC Enterprise announced the initial closing of its $528 million capital raise, backed by institutional heavyweights including Anson Funds, Animoca Brands, and Kenetic Capital. The financing marks one of the largest Bitcoin ( BTC )-dedicated raises by a publicly traded company and includes a mix of convertible notes, private placements, and an equity line of credit, all earmarked for aggressive BTC accumulation. The move puts DDC on a radically different path from most consumer-facing companies. It also cements its position as one of the few public firms outside of tech or crypto sectors to aggressively restructure around Bitcoin. You might also like: Bitcoin set for ranged trading as Q3 begins: Bitfinex DDC’s radical Bitcoin transformation According to the press release, the initial closings of DDC’s $528 million financing package includes a $26 million PIPE investment from crypto-native institutions like Animoca Brands and Kenetic Capital, a $25 million convertible note from Anson Funds (with $275 million more available), and a $2 million private placement. Perhaps most strategically significant is the $200 million equity line of credit, giving DDC dry powder to accumulate Bitcoin opportunistically during market dips. This isn’t just treasury diversification; it’s a full-scale financial pivot. While DDC maintains its Asian food brands like DayDayCook and Yai’s Thai, its balance sheet is being radically reshaped. The company’s previous announcement in June made its ambitions clear: “Substantially all of the capital raise will be dedicated to expanding the Company’s Bitcoin treasury.” CEO Norma Chu’s vision leaves little room for ambiguity: “This maximum aggregate $528 million capital commitment marks a watershed moment for DDC. With premier institutions such as Anson Funds, Animoca Brands, and Kenetic Capital backing our vision, we believe we have unprecedented capacity to execute our mission of building one of the world’s most valuable corporate Bitcoin treasuries and becoming a top global Bitcoin holder.” DDC’s bet hinges on Bitcoin’s long-term appreciation outpacing traditional investments. With spot ETFs funneling institutional money into BTC and the 2024 halving historically preceding bull cycles, DDC’s timing aligns with a macro narrative gaining Wall Street credence. Yet risks loom: regulatory uncertainty, Bitcoin’s volatility, and the specter of illiquidity if markets swing erratically.

2025-07-01T15:30:24,"Here’s What Will Happen If The Bitcoin Price Can Manage A Clean Break Above $108,500","A crypto analyst has forecasted a powerful Wave 3 Bitcoin price rally that could take it toward new all-time highs between $160,000 and $200,000. Notably, this surge is expected to come with rising Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) and a delayed altcoin season, particularly if BTC can make a clean break above the $108,500 resistance level. Bitcoin Price Breakout To Spark Next Bull Run The Bitcoin price is currently hovering below a critical resistance level at $108,500, and according to a crypto analyst known as ‘BigMike7335’ on the X social media platform, a clean breakout and flip of this level into support could ignite an explosive Wave 3 bull run. Based on Elliott Wave Theory and Fibonacci Extension analysis, a successful move above this threshold could open the door to a bullish price surge with potential targets set in the $160,000 to $200,000 range. Related Reading: Bitcoin Flashes Double Top Above $106,000: FVG Says A Large Crash Is Coming The analyst’s chart shows that Bitcoin has already completed its Wave 1 of a five-wave impulse move, followed by an ABC corrective Wave 2. The market is also currently consolidating, and Bitcoin’s bullish momentum appears to be rebuilding. These positive developments are supported by a rising Stochastic Relative Strength Index (RSI) from the oversold region and a neutral-to-bullish RSI, both of which point toward upward price action. Notably, the 0.618 and 1.0 Fibonacci Extensions around $117,795 and $137,421, respectively, are highlighted as interim resistance zones where price momentum could temporarily slow before continuing upward. A clean breakout above $108,500 could also place Bitcoin above a heavy volume node visible in the volume profile within the chart, suggesting less overhead resistance and a stronger potential for a price rally. Furthermore, the analysis implies that during this powerful Wave 3 phase, Bitcoin Dominance will likely climb toward 70%. This increase in BTC.D would mean capital is concentrating in the leading cryptocurrency, which historically results in altcoins underperforming. As a result, the expected altcoin season for this cycle may be postponed, following the completion or cooling of Wave 3. Analyst Predicts $375,000 Bitcoin Bull Run Peak Crypto analyst TechDave has just sounded the alarm on what he calls the Bitcoin “launch signal”, a rare trigger that has only appeared four times in history and each time marked the start of major bull market rallies. This signal previously appeared in October 2012, July 2016, and July 2020—all preceding major upward moves that ended in new cycle peaks. Related Reading: Fading Spot Volumes And Muted Futures Sentiment Threaten To Send Bitcoin Below $99,000 Again Currently, the same signal is emerging this July, aligning with the previous cycle structures and reinforcing the expectation of a breakout phase. Notably, the formation has led to exponential gains, with each bull market run typically peaking months later. Following this historical pattern, TechDave now predicts a fresh cycle top for Bitcoin at $375,000.

Matrixport: July Is a Historically Strong Month for Bitcoin The analysis revealed that in seven of the last 10 years, Bitcoin closed July with an increase, with an average return of 9.1% in these months. It was emphasized that in the three years of decline, losses remained only in single digits. In particular, strong double-digit rallies were observed in five of these seven years of increase. $116,000 Target on the Agenda As July approaches, optimism and bullish expectations increase in the market, and according to Matrixport’s analysis, this historical trend may show itself again. The company shared its view that the Bitcoin price could test the $116,000 level in the coming weeks. This expectation is based on both past performance and the increase in investor sentiment in July.

2025-07-01T15:10:20,"Can Bitcoin-Backed Bonds Solve America’s Financial Trouble?","As the U.S. struggles with rising debt and interest costs, a new idea is gaining traction: Bit Bonds. These are treasury bonds partially backed by Bitcoin . The pitch: Let investors accept lower yields in exchange for upside exposure to the world’s most volatile digital asset. How Bit Bonds Work Bit Bonds function basically like standard Treasuries. The U.S. Treasury issues bonds at a reduced interest rate (say 1%) and allocates a portion of the proceeds to purchase Bitcoin. If Bitcoin appreciates over the term, bondholders receive a bonus on top of their principal. If not, they still receive full repayment plus the fixed coupon. It’s effectively a low-risk bond with an embedded call option on Bitcoin without the complexity of options trading. At current debt levels, interest costs are a growing threat to fiscal stability. Swapping a portion of traditional debt for Bit Bonds could shave billions off the annual interest bill. If Bitcoin rallies, the Treasury’s retained share of the upside could be used to reduce the national debt or fund public programs without raising taxes. Even if Bitcoin underperforms, the interest savings from lower coupons may outweigh losses from the crypto exposure. A Safer Path to Bitcoin Exposure For investors, Bit Bonds are a novel middle ground. They offer upside exposure to Bitcoin without the self-custody, exchange risk, or volatility of direct ownership. That makes them attractive to institutions, like pensions or insurance funds, that want Bitcoin exposure but can’t take on full crypto risk. Skeptics point to past gold-backed bonds as similar experiments. However, Bitcoin’s higher upside potential could make Bit Bonds far more popular. If demand grows, yields across all Treasuries may fall, giving the U.S. even more fiscal breathing room. Bit Bonds won’t fix everything. But in a world where debt grows faster than solutions, they might be the start of something big.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/can-bitcoin-backed-bonds-solve-americas-financial-trouble/,"BTC|REGULATION|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare
2025-07-01T15:10:07,"Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq mixed as investors weigh tariff talks","The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite opened mixed on Tuesday, July 1, with the third quarter of 2025 having a slow start amid jitters around President Donald Trump’s budget bill and looming tariffs deadline. Dow Jones Industrial was 75 points up, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were at -0.2% and -0.3%, signaling a potential pullback. The largely lower trading comes after a second quarter 2025 run that saw stocks recover from a major dip in April to end the period emphatically in the green. Notably, Wall Street saw all three major indices rise on Monday, with the benchmark index S&P 500 hitting record highs above 6,204. Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs had seen a bloodbath across the market, pushing the index into negative territory by early April. However, resilience even during recent geopolitical tensions in the Middle East meant the S&P 500 closed the three-month period in bullish mood. The blue chip Dow also ended the second quarter on a high with over 270 points on Monday, with this putting it up 5% over the period. Meanwhile, Nasdaq clawed back gains to close Q2 18% higher. You might also like: Dow Jones up on strong trade news, Trump’s tax bill Q3 starts slow While investor sentiment remains largely upbeat, Wall Street is starting slow for Q3 amid potential headwinds around trade talks. Focus on Trump’s mega budget bill, which had the U.S. Senate vote overnight, and fresh feuding between the president and Tesla and SpaceX chief executive Elon Musk has markets a little on edge. This indeed saw the Tesla stock price pare gains on Tuesday, with Trump suggesting DOGE may have to take a look at the subsidies offered to Musk’s companies. The outlook in the cryptocurrency market signalled a lack of upside conviction, with Bitcoin ( BTC ) shedding gains to below $107k. Analysts at Bitfinex say BTC could see range-bound trading amid a historically unimpressive Q3 for bulls. Tariffs and Jerome Powell’s speech As noted, market attention has shifted from the hostilities in the Middle East, with the Israel-Iran hostilities down, to potential downside catalysts. The tariffs front has Trump’s July 9 deadline in focus, with reports suggesting White House is eyeing “narrowed” deals. Financial Times reported this to be the administration’s goal well before the date of the “reciprocal” tariffs rolls in. Elsewhere, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell will speak on Tuesday, with this coming amid the latest push from Trump regarding interest rate cuts. While the Fed hasn’t signalled such a move, investors are betting on a cut in coming months. Investors will also be keen on this week’s economic data reports, including the June jobs report.

Key Takeaways: Deutsche Bank will launch a crypto custody service in 2026 with support from Bitpanda and Taurus. The bank is exploring stablecoins and tokenized deposits, signaling a deeper commitment to digital assets. Major German banks, including Sparkassen and DZ Bank, are also moving into crypto services. The German banking giant’s corporate division will also maintain its collaboration with Swiss provider Taurus SA, which has been involved in Deutsche Bank’s custody plans since they were first unveiled in 2022. The custody push comes as major financial institutions ramp up digital asset efforts, spurred by evolving regulations in Europe and supportive moves in the U.S. following Donald Trump’s reelection. Deutsche Bank Expands Crypto Footing Deutsche Bank confirmed earlier this month that it is exploring stablecoins and tokenized deposits, which could involve issuing its own token or joining broader industry initiatives. The bank is also weighing the development of a tokenized deposit solution for payments. Notably, Deutsche Bank was among investors backing a $65 million funding round last year for Taurus , reflecting its growing commitment to the digital asset space. BREAKING Germany's largest bank, Deutsche Bank, to launch crypto custody services in 2026 pic.twitter.com/Bx0UbFcJMF — Quinten | 048.eth (@QuintenFrancois) July 1, 2025 Deutsche Bank’s crypto expansion comes as a number of major German banks have already begun integrating crypto services. Just recently, Germany’s Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe announced plans to launch crypto trading for its 50 million customers by summer 2026. Dekabank, owned by Sparkassen, will oversee the crypto offering through the group’s mobile banking app, enabling direct trading of Bitcoin and Ether. Likewise, DZ Bank, Germany’s second-largest lender, partnered with Boerse Stuttgart Digital last year to pilot crypto trading and custody services, aiming to expand offerings across its 700 cooperative banks after initial trials. Meanwhile, Landesbank Baden-Württemberg, the country’s biggest federal bank, announced plans in April 2024 to provide crypto custody services for institutional clients in collaboration with Bitpanda. The momentum isn’t limited to Germany. Speaking in April, Eric Trump warned that banks resisting crypto could become obsolete within a decade, highlighting issues of speed and cost in traditional finance. Big Banks Change Stance Toward Crypto Major banks including JPMorgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo are meeting with officials in Republican-led states like Texas and Oklahoma to address accusations of political bias, especially toward fossil fuel and firearms industries. Some states have blacklisted these banks from contracts, prompting banks to defend or adjust their policies. Citigroup ended its restriction on working with firearms vendors selling to buyers under 21, while JPMorgan and others clarified they don’t base lending decisions on political views. Banks are also retreating from climate-focused alliances and easing restrictions on coal financing to avoid further backlash. At the federal level, the Trump administration is considering an executive order to prohibit banks from denying services based on political or religious beliefs, which could affect banks’ participation in government business, including selling Treasury bonds.

2025-07-01T15:05:49,"Everything You Need to Know About GameStop’s Plan to Start Buying Bitcoin","GameStop is diving deeper into Bitcoin. The retailer has raised over $4 billion through convertible note sales this year, and it plans to use a chunk of that to build a Bitcoin treasury . GameStop’s Convertible Note Play In March 2025, GameStop issued $1.48 billion in convertible notes, a type of debt investors can later turn into equity. A filing with the SEC revealed that proceeds would go toward “general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Bitcoin.” That promise became reality in May when GameStop purchased 4,710 BTC, worth roughly $513 million at the time, marking the company’s first official Bitcoin buy. This month, GameStop doubled down. A second convertible note offering raised $2.25 billion, with investors quickly exercising an option to purchase an additional $450 million, bringing the total raised to $2.7 billion in June alone . GameStop’s move mirrors MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy, which used corporate debt to accumulate over 200,000 BTC. Strategy’s stock now effectively trades as a Bitcoin ETF with leverage. While GameStop hasn’t gone that far, its board appears to see Bitcoin as a potential lifeline. The company has faced years of declining retail performance and sees crypto as a hedge, a growth bet, or maybe even both. If the company allocates most of its new war chest to BTC, its holdings could rival Strategy’s on a relative basis, representing nearly a third of GameStop’s total market cap. A Company-Wide Pivot? For now, GameStop is a retailer with a speculative treasury strategy. But if Bitcoin appreciates and GameStop continues to issue debt to buy more, it could evolve into a crypto proxy, a high-beta Bitcoin stock, or even a new kind of hybrid public company.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-gamestops-plan-to-start-buying-bitcoin/,"BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|MARKET","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

He spent over $100,000 in a single trade to pick up one whole Bitcoin. Instead of sitting on the sidelines, he chose to put his money where his mouth is. Bold Bet On Bitcoin According to Kiyosaki’s tweet, he snapped up 1 BTC at about $106,784. He said he’d rather “suck” than be a loser by missing out. Bitcoin is sitting just above $100,000 right now, but Kiyosaki thinks that it could climb much higher. He’s been warning followers for years that a new wave of growth is coming and that this asset might one day hit the $1 million mark. Bought another Bitcoin today. I realize I could be wrong and a sucker. Would not be the first time in my life I was played for a FOOL. Yet I believe Bitcoin will one day soon….be $1 million a coin. If I am a sucker…. I’d rather be a sucker than a LOSER if Bitcoin does go to… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) July 1, 2025 Chasing The Million Dollar Mark Based on reports, going from roughly $106,784 to $1,000,000 means about 830% growth. That’s a huge jump. Kiyosaki first floated this million‑dollar idea back in 2021, projecting it could arrive by 2030. He told his audience to do their own homework, reminding them that he might be wrong. Still, he framed his move as a risk worth taking rather than living with regrets. Voices From The Market Other big names share his optimism. Binance’s Changpeng Zhao thinks Bitcoin could top $1 million in the current cycle if the rally stretches out. Jan3 CEO Samson Mow predicts Bitcoin will hit the $1 million mark , steered by nation-state adoption anx sovereign debt issuance. Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood gives a base case of $1.5 million by 2030 and even teases a $2.5 million scenario if things really heat up. Despite that chorus of bullish calls, a good number of traders view the current price as steep. Some say the top crypto asset is trading at a premium around $106,700, while others call it a steal before the next surge. The mix of views keeps the debate alive. Kiyosaki’s move is more than a personal gamble. It sparks fresh talk about how far Bitcoin can go. It also shines a light on the growing role of big investors and public figures in shaping market mood. When someone with decades of experience takes a stand, it catches attention. As always, Kiyosaki ends with a reminder to think for yourself. He urged people to weigh the pros and cons instead of blindly copying his play. Whether Bitcoin soars to $1 million or stalls along the way, his bold buy will be one to watch.

2025-07-01T14:55:41,"Crypto Analyst Who Nailed XRP’s Massive 2024 Rally Believes It Might Be Time For “Round 2”","A crypto strategist known for accurately predicting the mega XRP price eruption in Q4 2024 says that the Ripple-affiliated crypto may be on the verge of igniting another parabolic surge. In a June 30 post on X, pseudonymous analyst DonAlt told his 671.5K followers that XRP could be setting up for “Round 2” of its meteoric rally. He noted that XRP was enjoying paltry gains while other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) traded lower. Notably, BTC started July in a lackluster style, plummeting to month-to-date lows under $106,500 at publication time. XRP, meanwhile, has gained a meagre 0.8% over the last 24 hours as renowned crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) analysts tip a whopping 95% chance for spot XRP-based ETFs to be greenlighted by the US Securities and Exchange Commission this year. Last November, XRP jumped by an impressive 280%, considerably outperforming the wider crypto market. On Nov. 13, DonAlt encouraged investors to “long XRP,” which he called “the perfect trade.” The cross-border payments coin then skyrocketed by over 320% in the span of 20 days. XRP ended up peaking at $3.31 on January 18 after a brief accumulation phase, according to CoinGecko data. Despite several months of stagnating price action, XRP sentiment has reached a record high, fueled by a stalled $50 million settlement between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission. As previously reported by ZyCrypto , this development contradicts the waning optimism surrounding Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have witnessed dwindling retail demand as the crypto market moves sideways. XRP Fundamentals Hint At Breakout Ahead DonAlt’s prediction comes after Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced that the company was tossing out its cross-appeal against the SEC and expects the regulator to do the same. “We’re closing this chapter once and for all and focusing on what’s most important — building the internet of Value. Lock in,” Garlinghouse declared at the time. If the SEC also drops its appeal, it could bring to an end the legal brawl between Ripple and the US securities watchdog that has lasted for nearly five years and likely act as a powerful bullish catalyst for XRP. Meanwhile, the XRP Ledger, a blockchain associated with Ripple, launched its EVM sidechain on mainnet to enable Ethereum-based smart contracts and cross-chain DeFi. These positive fundamentals could set the stage for a move toward the much-elusive $3 mark and beyond.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/crypto-analyst-who-nailed-xrps-massive-2024-rally-believes-it-might-be-time-for-round-2/,"XRP|TRADING|BTC|REGULATION|EXCHANGE","Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News",cryptocompare
2025-07-01T14:51:54,"Bitcoin Price Prediction – Spanish Coffee Chain Approves 1 Billion Euro BTC Buy: Is This the Next Tesla?","Bitcoin gained new momentum this week after Vanadi Coffee, a small Spanish coffee chain with just six outlets in Alicante, revealed plans to invest up to €1 billion in Bitcoin. In a June 29 filing, shareholders approved a strategic shift to adopt BTC as the company’s primary treasury asset. The decision makes Vanadi the largest publicly listed Bitcoin-holding company in Spain, surpassing traditional firms in market influence despite its modest footprint. Vanadi Coffee's Shareholders' Meeting has approved the company's strategic shift to become the largest listed Bitcoin company in Spain with investments of up to one billion euro in #bitcoin . They also purchased an additional 20 BTC and now have 54 BTC. (posted in this Vanadi… pic.twitter.com/LtBK0WPyJE — NLNico (@btcNLNico) June 29, 2025 The company acquired 20 more Bitcoins this month at an average price of €93,444, raising its total holdings to 54 BTC. These digital assets, now valued at roughly €5.8 million, are held securely with Spanish crypto custody provider Bit2Me. Vanadi’s board emphasized the shift in its filing, stating it intends to follow the path of MicroStrategy in the U.S. and Metaplanet in Japan by accumulating BTC long-term. Stock Triples as Market Reacts to Bitcoin Pivot Since the announcement , Vanadi’s stock price has surged more than 200% on BME Growth, Spain’s exchange for small- and mid-sized enterprises. Investors are viewing the Bitcoin strategy as a bold but timely response to the company’s €3.3 million loss in 2024, which marked a 15.8% year-over-year increase. The pivot to Bitcoin is now central to Vanadi’s turnaround plan, with the board describing the move as a complete overhaul of its business model. In the translated statement, Vanadi said it “redefines its business model and will use Bitcoin as its main reserve asset, accumulating large amounts of Bitcoin as part of its treasury.” The firm is reportedly in talks with a local software company and international investor Alpha Blue Ocean, which has deployed over €1.5 billion globally. Both may contribute capital to support the Bitcoin acquisition plan. Key Highlights: Vanadi Coffee has acquired 54 BTC to date Average buy price for June BTC tranche: €93,444 Stock has surged 200% in 30 days post-announcement Bit2Me is acting as BTC custodian for Vanadi Bitcoin Price Holds Above $106K – What’s Next? As Vanadi commits to BTC, Bitcoin is trading at $106,850, down 0.72% over the last 24 hours. Price action remains range-bound below key resistance at $108,980 and the 50-period EMA at $107,257. Technical indicators suggest neutral-to-bearish momentum, keeping Bitcoin price prediction weaker. MACD remains below the signal line with red histogram bars, reflecting consolidation fatigue. Traders are watching for a breakout above $109,000 to revive bullish sentiment, which could open doors to $110,448 and $111,944. On the downside, failure to hold $106,450 may trigger a move toward $104,840. Until volume picks up, Bitcoin is likely to remain stuck in this narrow range. Whether Vanadi becomes the “Tesla of Spain” remains to be seen, but the bet on Bitcoin is already shaking up both the Spanish equity and crypto landscape. BTC Bull Token Nears $8.8M Hard Cap as Presale Enters Final Hours With Bitcoin trading near $105,000, investor focus is shifting toward BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) , a rising altcoin that is nearly fully allocated during its presale. As of today, the project has raised $7,844,655 of its $8,873,431 target, leaving under $1 million to be raised before the token price moves to the next tier. Currently priced at $0.002585, early buyers have a limited time to enter before the subsequent price increase takes effect. Bitcoin-Linked Tokenomics and Burn Mechanism BTCBULL ties its value directly to Bitcoin’s price through two smart systems: BTC Airdrops: Distributed to holders, with priority for presale participants.

2025-07-01T14:50:34,"Bitcoin ETFs: Remarkable $102M Inflows Signal Strong Investor Confidence","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin ETFs: Remarkable $102M Inflows Signal Strong Investor Confidence The world of digital assets is buzzing with exciting news as U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs continue their impressive streak of investor confidence. On June 30, these investment vehicles collectively saw a significant net inflow of $102.28 million, marking an extraordinary 15th consecutive trading day of positive inflows. This sustained interest signals a growing appetite among investors for regulated access to the premier cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. This consistent influx of capital into Bitcoin ETFs underscores a pivotal shift in how traditional finance views and engages with digital assets, highlighting a burgeoning trend of institutional embrace. Understanding the Latest Bitcoin ETFs Inflow Surge The recent surge in capital flowing into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs is a clear indicator of robust market sentiment. According to data shared by Trader T (@thepfund) on X, the close of June saw a continuation of a trend that began weeks prior. This isn’t just a fleeting moment of interest; 15 consecutive days of net inflows represent a sustained period of capital accumulation, suggesting a foundational strengthening of the market’s conviction in Bitcoin. What does this consistent inflow signify for the average investor and the broader crypto ecosystem? It suggests that despite market fluctuations, there’s a steady, underlying demand for Bitcoin exposure through regulated, accessible channels. This consistent inflow provides a degree of stability and legitimacy that was once elusive for digital assets, paving the way for more widespread adoption and integration into traditional investment portfolios. It showcases a growing comfort level among both retail and institutional participants with this new asset class. What’s Driving the Momentum in Spot Bitcoin ETFs ? While the overall picture is one of net inflows, a closer look reveals interesting dynamics among individual spot Bitcoin ETFs . BlackRock’s IBIT, for instance, continues to be a dominant force, recording a substantial net inflow of $112.46 million on June 30 alone. This performance highlights BlackRock’s significant market presence and the trust investors place in its offerings, often seen as a bellwether for broader institutional interest. Conversely, ARK Invest’s ARKB experienced a net outflow of $10.18 million on the same day. The remaining ETFs reported no change in their holdings, indicating a stable, albeit less active, participation from their investor base. This disparity can be attributed to various factors, including the differing strategies of fund managers, marketing efforts, and the specific investor demographics each ETF attracts. However, the overarching narrative remains positive: the net sum of these movements is strongly in favor of inflows, reinforcing the positive outlook for these products. The ease of trading, regulatory oversight, and the ability to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly managing private keys are significant drivers for both retail and institutional investors seeking a simpler, more secure entry point into the crypto market. Here’s a snapshot of the June 30 performance: ETF Ticker Net Flow (June 30) Significance IBIT (BlackRock) +$112.46 million Leading the charge with significant positive contributions, showcasing strong investor confidence. ARKB (ARK Invest) -$10.18 million An outlier with a minor outflow, contrasting the broader positive trend among other ETFs. Other ETFs No change Indicating stable, consistent holdings without major daily shifts, reflecting a holding pattern. Deep Dive: Key Players and Crypto Inflows Dynamics BlackRock’s IBIT has consistently demonstrated its strength in attracting capital, often offsetting outflows from other funds. This consistent performance by a major financial institution like BlackRock is crucial. It signifies not just investor interest but also the commitment of established financial giants to the digital asset space. These sustained crypto inflows are more than just numbers; they represent a growing conviction that Bitcoin is a legitimate, long-term asset class worthy of significant allocation in diversified portfolios. The dynamics of these inflows are complex. They are influenced by global macroeconomic conditions, Bitcoin’s price performance, evolving regulatory developments, and even geopolitical events. However, the sustained nature of these inflows, especially across different market conditions, suggests a fundamental shift in investor perception. It points towards a future where digital assets are increasingly integrated into diversified portfolios, moving beyond speculative trading to become a recognized component of strategic investment planning. This sustained interest indicates a maturation of the market, moving past initial hype to more fundamental adoption. Potential challenges include continued market volatility and the evolving regulatory landscape. While the U.S. has made strides with spot ETF approvals, other jurisdictions are still catching up, and future regulatory actions could impact investor sentiment. Nevertheless, the current trend paints a picture of resilience and growing maturity for the crypto market, attracting more cautious investors. The Impact of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption The approval and subsequent success of spot Bitcoin ETFs have fundamentally reshaped the landscape for institutional Bitcoin adoption. For years, large institutions faced hurdles in accessing Bitcoin directly due to compliance issues, custody complexities, and a lack of regulated investment vehicles. ETFs have shattered these barriers, providing a familiar, regulated, and liquid pathway for institutions to gain exposure, thereby democratizing access to this innovative asset. The benefits for institutional investors are manifold, making Bitcoin an increasingly attractive proposition: Simplified Access: Institutions can now invest in Bitcoin through traditional brokerage accounts, eliminating the need for specialized crypto wallets or exchanges, streamlining their investment process. Regulatory Compliance: ETFs operate under existing financial regulations, making them palatable for institutions with strict compliance requirements and risk management protocols. Enhanced Liquidity: The high trading volumes of popular ETFs ensure easy entry and exit points for large capital movements, providing flexibility for portfolio adjustments. Diversification Potential: Bitcoin offers a new avenue for portfolio diversification, potentially uncorrelated with traditional assets in certain market conditions, offering a hedge against traditional market downturns. This institutional embrace is not merely about capital; it’s about legitimization. When major players like BlackRock, Fidelity, and others actively participate and attract significant inflows, it sends a powerful message to the broader financial world about Bitcoin’s enduring value and potential as a long-term store of value and growth asset. Navigating Your Bitcoin Investment Journey: What’s Next? For individuals considering or already engaged in their Bitcoin investment journey, the consistent ETF inflows offer valuable insights. While past performance is not indicative of future results, the sustained institutional interest suggests a maturing market with increasing foundational support. This doesn’t eliminate volatility, but it does imply a deeper pool of capital entering the ecosystem, potentially leading to more stable growth over time. Here are some actionable insights to consider as you navigate this evolving landscape: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on ETF inflow/outflow data, as it can be a key indicator of institutional sentiment and overall market health. Reliable data sources are crucial. Diversify Wisely: While Bitcoin is gaining traction, a balanced portfolio remains crucial. Understand how Bitcoin fits into your overall investment strategy and risk tolerance, ensuring it complements your existing assets. Understand the Risks: Despite institutional adoption, Bitcoin and the broader crypto market remain volatile. Invest only what you can afford to lose, and conduct thorough due diligence before making any investment decisions. Consider Your Access Point: Decide whether direct Bitcoin ownership or ETF exposure aligns better with your investment goals, risk tolerance, and technical comfort level. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages. The future of Bitcoin and its integration into the global financial system looks increasingly bright, fueled by the very trends we’re observing in these ETF inflows. As more institutions gain confidence and allocate capital, the digital asset landscape is set for continued evolution and growth, promising exciting developments for investors worldwide. The consistent net inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, culminating in a remarkable 15-day streak and a $102.28 million boost on June 30, are a testament to Bitcoin’s growing acceptance and appeal within traditional finance. Led by strong performances from funds like BlackRock’s IBIT, these figures underscore a powerful narrative of institutional confidence and increasing accessibility for investors worldwide. This sustained momentum signals a pivotal era for Bitcoin, solidifying its position as a compelling asset class and paving the way for further integration into mainstream investment strategies. The future looks promising as capital continues to flow into this innovative corner of the financial world, shaping the next chapter of digital asset adoption.

South Korean firms are increasingly taking advantage of the new regulatory clarity around stablecoins. On Tuesday, June 1, Upbit, the nation’s largest crypto exchange, and Naver Pay, a fintech payment platform, joined forces to develop a Korean won stablecoin. “It seems that Naver Pay will take the lead and Dunamu will cooperate,” stated an official from Dunamu, the operator of Upbit. “We will specify the scope and methods of cooperation as soon as the relevant system is established.” Earlier, on June 26, Naver Pay announced that it would be leading a consortium of companies for the introduction of stablecoins backed by the won.

The CEO of the Lingerie Fighting Championship plans to build the company’s own Bitcoin treasury, and he’s taking inspiration from an unlikely source: GameStop. Is this a flash in the pan, or is the Lingerie Fighting Championship onto something? And what does it mean for the future of Bitcoin treasuries – and for innovative applications of the blockchain? From GameStop, to Strategy, and Back Again Remember the glory days of GameStop stonks? Back when Robinhood, the trading platform, and GameStop were household names, at least for a certain sector of the trading populace. Since the heady days of $81.25 $GME stock, back in 2021, GameStop has largely trundled along, doing its own thing. Over the past year, it traded in a fairly narrow range, up a little under 5%. But GameStop did make a big splash a few weeks ago, when it announced that it was taking a step back from Michael Saylor’s Strategy approach, and would be amassing its own Bitcoin treasury. Ironically, back in 2020 and 2021, when $GME was soaring, Michael Saylor had already started to take the approach with (Micro)Strategy that would make him famous, purchasing Bitcoin early and often. And as Bitcoin’s price rose, Strategy’s strategy paid off. So when GameStop announced that it would follow in Saylor’s footsteps, some heads turned. And without further ado, GameStop purchased 4,170 Bitcoin. GameStop Inspires LFC Back to Shaun Donelly. The LFC CEO watched GameStop make its big Bitcoin purchase and decided to follow suit. To that end, the LFC will purchase $230K of Bitcoin in the next month; they plan to spend up to $2M in the next six months. The move comes ahead of a series of first-ever UK shows, with key fighters in the LFC ready to take the stage. It’s not a trendsetting move, but rather one that follows a Bitcoin treasury strategy that has been adopted by companies both large and small alike, and even by the US government itself. And there’s every sign that GameStop isn’t done – the company has $450M of a potential $2.25B ready to deploy to bolster its Bitcoin supply, according to a recent SEC filing. Donelly hopes that his company can tap into the same energy Strategy did, and maybe even a bit of the same profit over the next decade; since making its first Bitcoin purchase, $MSTR stock is up 3,170%. There’s another project in the works that aims to take advantage of the healthy crypto climate. SUBBD Token aims to spice up the $85B content creation market with a combination of AI + blockchain. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) – Bringing Fans and Creators Together with $SUBBD The SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is another red-hot commodity.
