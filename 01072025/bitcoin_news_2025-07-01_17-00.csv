2025-07-01T14:55:41,"Crypto Analyst Who Nailed XRP’s Massive 2024 Rally Believes It Might Be Time For “Round 2”","A crypto strategist known for accurately predicting the mega XRP price eruption in Q4 2024 says that the Ripple-affiliated crypto may be on the verge of igniting another parabolic surge. In a June 30 post on X, pseudonymous analyst DonAlt told his 671.5K followers that XRP could be setting up for “Round 2” of its meteoric rally. He noted that XRP was enjoying paltry gains while other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) traded lower. Notably, BTC started July in a lackluster style, plummeting to month-to-date lows under $106,500 at publication time. XRP, meanwhile, has gained a meagre 0.8% over the last 24 hours as renowned crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) analysts tip a whopping 95% chance for spot XRP-based ETFs to be greenlighted by the US Securities and Exchange Commission this year. Last November, XRP jumped by an impressive 280%, considerably outperforming the wider crypto market. On Nov. 13, DonAlt encouraged investors to “long XRP,” which he called “the perfect trade.” The cross-border payments coin then skyrocketed by over 320% in the span of 20 days. XRP ended up peaking at $3.31 on January 18 after a brief accumulation phase, according to CoinGecko data. Despite several months of stagnating price action, XRP sentiment has reached a record high, fueled by a stalled $50 million settlement between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission. As previously reported by ZyCrypto , this development contradicts the waning optimism surrounding Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have witnessed dwindling retail demand as the crypto market moves sideways. XRP Fundamentals Hint At Breakout Ahead DonAlt’s prediction comes after Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced that the company was tossing out its cross-appeal against the SEC and expects the regulator to do the same. “We’re closing this chapter once and for all and focusing on what’s most important — building the internet of Value. Lock in,” Garlinghouse declared at the time. If the SEC also drops its appeal, it could bring to an end the legal brawl between Ripple and the US securities watchdog that has lasted for nearly five years and likely act as a powerful bullish catalyst for XRP. Meanwhile, the XRP Ledger, a blockchain associated with Ripple, launched its EVM sidechain on mainnet to enable Ethereum-based smart contracts and cross-chain DeFi. These positive fundamentals could set the stage for a move toward the much-elusive $3 mark and beyond.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/crypto-analyst-who-nailed-xrps-massive-2024-rally-believes-it-might-be-time-for-round-2/,"XRP|TRADING|BTC|REGULATION|EXCHANGE","Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News",cryptocompare
2025-07-01T14:51:54,"Bitcoin Price Prediction – Spanish Coffee Chain Approves 1 Billion Euro BTC Buy: Is This the Next Tesla?","Bitcoin gained new momentum this week after Vanadi Coffee, a small Spanish coffee chain with just six outlets in Alicante, revealed plans to invest up to €1 billion in Bitcoin. In a June 29 filing, shareholders approved a strategic shift to adopt BTC as the company’s primary treasury asset. The decision makes Vanadi the largest publicly listed Bitcoin-holding company in Spain, surpassing traditional firms in market influence despite its modest footprint. Vanadi Coffee's Shareholders' Meeting has approved the company's strategic shift to become the largest listed Bitcoin company in Spain with investments of up to one billion euro in #bitcoin . They also purchased an additional 20 BTC and now have 54 BTC. (posted in this Vanadi… pic.twitter.com/LtBK0WPyJE — NLNico (@btcNLNico) June 29, 2025 The company acquired 20 more Bitcoins this month at an average price of €93,444, raising its total holdings to 54 BTC. These digital assets, now valued at roughly €5.8 million, are held securely with Spanish crypto custody provider Bit2Me. Vanadi’s board emphasized the shift in its filing, stating it intends to follow the path of MicroStrategy in the U.S. and Metaplanet in Japan by accumulating BTC long-term. Stock Triples as Market Reacts to Bitcoin Pivot Since the announcement , Vanadi’s stock price has surged more than 200% on BME Growth, Spain’s exchange for small- and mid-sized enterprises. Investors are viewing the Bitcoin strategy as a bold but timely response to the company’s €3.3 million loss in 2024, which marked a 15.8% year-over-year increase. The pivot to Bitcoin is now central to Vanadi’s turnaround plan, with the board describing the move as a complete overhaul of its business model. In the translated statement, Vanadi said it “redefines its business model and will use Bitcoin as its main reserve asset, accumulating large amounts of Bitcoin as part of its treasury.” The firm is reportedly in talks with a local software company and international investor Alpha Blue Ocean, which has deployed over €1.5 billion globally. Both may contribute capital to support the Bitcoin acquisition plan. Key Highlights: Vanadi Coffee has acquired 54 BTC to date Average buy price for June BTC tranche: €93,444 Stock has surged 200% in 30 days post-announcement Bit2Me is acting as BTC custodian for Vanadi Bitcoin Price Holds Above $106K – What’s Next? As Vanadi commits to BTC, Bitcoin is trading at $106,850, down 0.72% over the last 24 hours. Price action remains range-bound below key resistance at $108,980 and the 50-period EMA at $107,257. Technical indicators suggest neutral-to-bearish momentum, keeping Bitcoin price prediction weaker. MACD remains below the signal line with red histogram bars, reflecting consolidation fatigue. Traders are watching for a breakout above $109,000 to revive bullish sentiment, which could open doors to $110,448 and $111,944. On the downside, failure to hold $106,450 may trigger a move toward $104,840. Until volume picks up, Bitcoin is likely to remain stuck in this narrow range. Whether Vanadi becomes the “Tesla of Spain” remains to be seen, but the bet on Bitcoin is already shaking up both the Spanish equity and crypto landscape. BTC Bull Token Nears $8.8M Hard Cap as Presale Enters Final Hours With Bitcoin trading near $105,000, investor focus is shifting toward BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) , a rising altcoin that is nearly fully allocated during its presale. As of today, the project has raised $7,844,655 of its $8,873,431 target, leaving under $1 million to be raised before the token price moves to the next tier. Currently priced at $0.002585, early buyers have a limited time to enter before the subsequent price increase takes effect.

2025-07-01T14:50:34,"Bitcoin ETFs: Remarkable $102M Inflows Signal Strong Investor Confidence","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin ETFs: Remarkable $102M Inflows Signal Strong Investor Confidence The world of digital assets is buzzing with exciting news as U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs continue their impressive streak of investor confidence. On June 30, these investment vehicles collectively saw a significant net inflow of $102.28 million, marking an extraordinary 15th consecutive trading day of positive inflows. This sustained interest signals a growing appetite among investors for regulated access to the premier cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. This consistent influx of capital into Bitcoin ETFs underscores a pivotal shift in how traditional finance views and engages with digital assets, highlighting a burgeoning trend of institutional embrace. Understanding the Latest Bitcoin ETFs Inflow Surge The recent surge in capital flowing into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs is a clear indicator of robust market sentiment. According to data shared by Trader T (@thepfund) on X, the close of June saw a continuation of a trend that began weeks prior. This isn’t just a fleeting moment of interest; 15 consecutive days of net inflows represent a sustained period of capital accumulation, suggesting a foundational strengthening of the market’s conviction in Bitcoin. What does this consistent inflow signify for the average investor and the broader crypto ecosystem? It suggests that despite market fluctuations, there’s a steady, underlying demand for Bitcoin exposure through regulated, accessible channels. This consistent inflow provides a degree of stability and legitimacy that was once elusive for digital assets, paving the way for more widespread adoption and integration into traditional investment portfolios. It showcases a growing comfort level among both retail and institutional participants with this new asset class. What’s Driving the Momentum in Spot Bitcoin ETFs ? While the overall picture is one of net inflows, a closer look reveals interesting dynamics among individual spot Bitcoin ETFs . BlackRock’s IBIT, for instance, continues to be a dominant force, recording a substantial net inflow of $112.46 million on June 30 alone. This performance highlights BlackRock’s significant market presence and the trust investors place in its offerings, often seen as a bellwether for broader institutional interest. Conversely, ARK Invest’s ARKB experienced a net outflow of $10.18 million on the same day. The remaining ETFs reported no change in their holdings, indicating a stable, albeit less active, participation from their investor base. This disparity can be attributed to various factors, including the differing strategies of fund managers, marketing efforts, and the specific investor demographics each ETF attracts. However, the overarching narrative remains positive: the net sum of these movements is strongly in favor of inflows, reinforcing the positive outlook for these products. The ease of trading, regulatory oversight, and the ability to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly managing private keys are significant drivers for both retail and institutional investors seeking a simpler, more secure entry point into the crypto market. Here’s a snapshot of the June 30 performance: ETF Ticker Net Flow (June 30) Significance IBIT (BlackRock) +$112.46 million Leading the charge with significant positive contributions, showcasing strong investor confidence. ARKB (ARK Invest) -$10.18 million An outlier with a minor outflow, contrasting the broader positive trend among other ETFs. Other ETFs No change Indicating stable, consistent holdings without major daily shifts, reflecting a holding pattern. Deep Dive: Key Players and Crypto Inflows Dynamics BlackRock’s IBIT has consistently demonstrated its strength in attracting capital, often offsetting outflows from other funds. This consistent performance by a major financial institution like BlackRock is crucial. It signifies not just investor interest but also the commitment of established financial giants to the digital asset space. These sustained crypto inflows are more than just numbers; they represent a growing conviction that Bitcoin is a legitimate, long-term asset class worthy of significant allocation in diversified portfolios. The dynamics of these inflows are complex. They are influenced by global macroeconomic conditions, Bitcoin’s price performance, evolving regulatory developments, and even geopolitical events. However, the sustained nature of these inflows, especially across different market conditions, suggests a fundamental shift in investor perception. It points towards a future where digital assets are increasingly integrated into diversified portfolios, moving beyond speculative trading to become a recognized component of strategic investment planning. This sustained interest indicates a maturation of the market, moving past initial hype to more fundamental adoption. Potential challenges include continued market volatility and the evolving regulatory landscape. While the U.S. has made strides with spot ETF approvals, other jurisdictions are still catching up, and future regulatory actions could impact investor sentiment. Nevertheless, the current trend paints a picture of resilience and growing maturity for the crypto market, attracting more cautious investors. The Impact of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption The approval and subsequent success of spot Bitcoin ETFs have fundamentally reshaped the landscape for institutional Bitcoin adoption. For years, large institutions faced hurdles in accessing Bitcoin directly due to compliance issues, custody complexities, and a lack of regulated investment vehicles. ETFs have shattered these barriers, providing a familiar, regulated, and liquid pathway for institutions to gain exposure, thereby democratizing access to this innovative asset. The benefits for institutional investors are manifold, making Bitcoin an increasingly attractive proposition: Simplified Access: Institutions can now invest in Bitcoin through traditional brokerage accounts, eliminating the need for specialized crypto wallets or exchanges, streamlining their investment process. Regulatory Compliance: ETFs operate under existing financial regulations, making them palatable for institutions with strict compliance requirements and risk management protocols. Enhanced Liquidity: The high trading volumes of popular ETFs ensure easy entry and exit points for large capital movements, providing flexibility for portfolio adjustments. Diversification Potential: Bitcoin offers a new avenue for portfolio diversification, potentially uncorrelated with traditional assets in certain market conditions, offering a hedge against traditional market downturns. This institutional embrace is not merely about capital; it’s about legitimization. When major players like BlackRock, Fidelity, and others actively participate and attract significant inflows, it sends a powerful message to the broader financial world about Bitcoin’s enduring value and potential as a long-term store of value and growth asset. Navigating Your Bitcoin Investment Journey: What’s Next? For individuals considering or already engaged in their Bitcoin investment journey, the consistent ETF inflows offer valuable insights. While past performance is not indicative of future results, the sustained institutional interest suggests a maturing market with increasing foundational support. This doesn’t eliminate volatility, but it does imply a deeper pool of capital entering the ecosystem, potentially leading to more stable growth over time. Here are some actionable insights to consider as you navigate this evolving landscape: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on ETF inflow/outflow data, as it can be a key indicator of institutional sentiment and overall market health. Reliable data sources are crucial. Diversify Wisely: While Bitcoin is gaining traction, a balanced portfolio remains crucial. Understand how Bitcoin fits into your overall investment strategy and risk tolerance, ensuring it complements your existing assets. Understand the Risks: Despite institutional adoption, Bitcoin and the broader crypto market remain volatile. Invest only what you can afford to lose, and conduct thorough due diligence before making any investment decisions. Consider Your Access Point: Decide whether direct Bitcoin ownership or ETF exposure aligns better with your investment goals, risk tolerance, and technical comfort level. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages. The future of Bitcoin and its integration into the global financial system looks increasingly bright, fueled by the very trends we’re observing in these ETF inflows. As more institutions gain confidence and allocate capital, the digital asset landscape is set for continued evolution and growth, promising exciting developments for investors worldwide. The consistent net inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, culminating in a remarkable 15-day streak and a $102.28 million boost on June 30, are a testament to Bitcoin’s growing acceptance and appeal within traditional finance. Led by strong performances from funds like BlackRock’s IBIT, these figures underscore a powerful narrative of institutional confidence and increasing accessibility for investors worldwide. This sustained momentum signals a pivotal era for Bitcoin, solidifying its position as a compelling asset class and paving the way for further integration into mainstream investment strategies. The future looks promising as capital continues to flow into this innovative corner of the financial world, shaping the next chapter of digital asset adoption.

South Korean firms are increasingly taking advantage of the new regulatory clarity around stablecoins. On Tuesday, June 1, Upbit, the nation’s largest crypto exchange, and Naver Pay, a fintech payment platform, joined forces to develop a Korean won stablecoin. “It seems that Naver Pay will take the lead and Dunamu will cooperate,” stated an official from Dunamu, the operator of Upbit. “We will specify the scope and methods of cooperation as soon as the relevant system is established.” Earlier, on June 26, Naver Pay announced that it would be leading a consortium of companies for the introduction of stablecoins backed by the won.

2025-07-01T14:43:49,"GameStop Inspired a Lingerie MMA League to Buy Bitcoin: SUBBD Token Soars?","Shaun Donelly knows a hot item when he sees one – and Bitcoin’s the hottest item of them all. The CEO of the Lingerie Fighting Championship plans to build the company’s own Bitcoin treasury, and he’s taking inspiration from an unlikely source: GameStop. Is this a flash in the pan, or is the Lingerie Fighting Championship onto something? And what does it mean for the future of Bitcoin treasuries – and for innovative applications of the blockchain? From GameStop, to Strategy, and Back Again Remember the glory days of GameStop stonks? Back when Robinhood, the trading platform, and GameStop were household names, at least for a certain sector of the trading populace. Since the heady days of $81.25 $GME stock, back in 2021, GameStop has largely trundled along, doing its own thing. Over the past year, it traded in a fairly narrow range, up a little under 5%. But GameStop did make a big splash a few weeks ago, when it announced that it was taking a step back from Michael Saylor’s Strategy approach, and would be amassing its own Bitcoin treasury. Ironically, back in 2020 and 2021, when $GME was soaring, Michael Saylor had already started to take the approach with (Micro)Strategy that would make him famous, purchasing Bitcoin early and often. And as Bitcoin’s price rose, Strategy’s strategy paid off. So when GameStop announced that it would follow in Saylor’s footsteps, some heads turned. And without further ado, GameStop purchased 4,170 Bitcoin. GameStop Inspires LFC Back to Shaun Donelly. The LFC CEO watched GameStop make its big Bitcoin purchase and decided to follow suit. To that end, the LFC will purchase $230K of Bitcoin in the next month; they plan to spend up to $2M in the next six months. The move comes ahead of a series of first-ever UK shows, with key fighters in the LFC ready to take the stage. It’s not a trendsetting move, but rather one that follows a Bitcoin treasury strategy that has been adopted by companies both large and small alike, and even by the US government itself. And there’s every sign that GameStop isn’t done – the company has $450M of a potential $2.25B ready to deploy to bolster its Bitcoin supply, according to a recent SEC filing. Donelly hopes that his company can tap into the same energy Strategy did, and maybe even a bit of the same profit over the next decade; since making its first Bitcoin purchase, $MSTR stock is up 3,170%. There’s another project in the works that aims to take advantage of the healthy crypto climate. SUBBD Token aims to spice up the $85B content creation market with a combination of AI + blockchain. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) – Bringing Fans and Creators Together with $SUBBD The SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is another red-hot commodity. The SUBBD platform unleashes AI content management and production, bringing both together in one place for the first time. Creators gain new ways to connect with their fans, who can use $SUBBD to access exclusive content and receive subscription discounts. At the same time, the $SUBBD platform offers several AI tools, including: ✅ AI profile creation ✅ AI voice notes ✅ AI video generator ✅ AI livestream The entire suite can be used to boost AI influencers and to manage content from human creators. And with $SUBBD, both fans and creators alike can token-gate exclusive content to create new and more personal ways of interacting. The SUBBD Token presale, now on, has raised over $714K so far. Tokens are priced at $0.0558. Our price prediction shows the token price could reach $0.438by by the end of 2025, returning 684% to current investors. Learn how to buy SUBBD Token with our guide. Visit the SUBBD Token presale to learn more. From SUBBD to the LFC From GameStop to MicroStrategy and now to the Lingerie Fighting Championship, the Bitcoin treasury strategy continues to ripple across unexpected sectors. Shaun Donelly’s $2M commitment to BTC might seem unconventional, but it reflects a broader realization: Bitcoin – and crypto more broadly – is no longer fringe; it’s foundational. Projects like SUBBD Token are capitalizing on blockchain’s flexibility, merging AI, content creation, and fan engagement in powerful new ways. In the ring and online, the crypto fight is heating up.

2025-07-01T14:40:00,"Wall Street’s Bitcoin proxy eyes $14b quarter, without selling a thing","Michael Saylor’s once-unexciting software firm is now on track for a $14 billion windfall, not from enterprise sales, but from Bitcoin’s resurgence. As Wall Street debates whether his model is genius or gibberish, one thing is clear: The rules of corporate value are being rewritten. On July 1st, Bloomberg reported that Michael Saylor’s Strategy (MSTR) is poised to book an unrealized $14 billion gain in Q2. This figure would place the Tysons Corner, Virginia-based firm among elite Wall Street earners like Amazon and JPMorgan. The staggering sum stems not from the company’s software revenue, which remains modest at $112.8 million, but from a recent accounting shift that now values its 597,325 Bitcoin ( BTC ) holdings at market prices. The move, coupled with BTC’s 30% rally last quarter, has turned Saylor’s controversial Bitcoin bet into one of the most audacious and divisive corporate experiments in modern finance. You might also like: Bitcoin set for ranged trading as Q3 begins: Bitfinex How Strategy became Wall Street’s unlikely Bitcoin vanguard When Michael Saylor first announced Strategy’s pivot to Bitcoin in August 2020 with a $250 million buy, Wall Street dismissed it as a desperate gamble by a fading enterprise software firm. Four years later, that bet delivered a 3,300% stock surge, dwarfing the S&P 500’s 115% gain during the same period. Meanwhile Bitcoin itself appreciated roughly 1,000%, pushing Strategy’s holdings to over $64 billion. That performance, driven less by business fundamentals than by its asset exposure, has turned Strategy into what many analysts now describe as a de facto Bitcoin ETF with a software wrapper. The real turning point came on June 30, when Strategy earned inclusion in the Russell Top 200 Value Index , a benchmark traditionally reserved for cash-rich giants like ExxonMobil. This recognition underscores how radically perceptions have shifted. The Russell Top 200 Value Index typically favors companies with stable earnings and dividends; metrics Strategy conspicuously lacks. Instead, its 19.7% year-to-date Bitcoin yield convinced FTSE Russell that scarcity alone could define value. For critics, this represents a dangerous departure from fundamental analysis. For Saylor, it’s the ultimate vindication. You might also like: 91% chance MSTR enters S&P 500 — and Bitcoin becomes an index asset by proxy Critic brands Strategy’s model as “financial gibberish” According to the Bloomberg report, renowned short-seller Jim Chanos has derided Strategy’s model as “financial gibberish,” advocating an arbitrage trade that shorts MSTR stock while going long Bitcoin. His argument hinges on the stock’s premium over its underlying BTC holdings, a gap he believes will inevitably collapse. The feud reached new heights in Q2 when Bitcoin’s 30% rally generated a $14 billion paper profit for Strategy, while its legacy software business produced just $112.8 million in revenue. Yet despite the volatility and skepticism, Strategy’s influence is spreading and has given rise to several imitators looking to copy Saylor’s success. Sharplink Gaming has built a substantial Ethereum treasury, Upexi raised $100 million specifically for Solana purchases, and BitMine Immersion secured $250 million to accumulate Ether.

2025-07-01T14:30:41,"American Bitcoin Secures Monumental $220 Million for Crypto Mining","BitcoinWorld American Bitcoin Secures Monumental $220 Million for Crypto Mining The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with monumental news: American Bitcoin, a company co-founded by Eric Trump and major player Hut8, has successfully raised an astounding $220 million. This significant capital injection is earmarked for the strategic acquisition of Bitcoin (BTC) and cutting-edge digital asset mining equipment, signaling a robust expansion in the high-stakes realm of crypto mining. This isn’t just another funding round; it’s a powerful statement about the growing institutional and high-profile interest in the digital asset space, promising to reshape the landscape of digital asset production and ownership. What is American Bitcoin and Who’s Behind It? American Bitcoin is not just a new face in the crowded crypto landscape; it’s a strategic venture poised to make a significant impact. Co-founded by Eric Trump, the second son of former U.S. President Donald Trump, and Hut8, a well-established name in the Bitcoin mining sector, the company immediately gains a unique profile. Hut8, a prominent publicly traded Bitcoin miner, is known for its extensive operations, substantial hash rate, and a long-standing track record in the industry. Their expertise spans everything from large-scale data center management to optimizing mining rig performance. This collaboration merges political connectivity with proven industry experience, setting a strong foundation for American Bitcoin’s ambitious plans. Hut8’s involvement brings invaluable operational capacity, technical know-how, and a deep understanding of the global mining ecosystem. For American Bitcoin, this partnership means leveraging Hut8’s existing infrastructure and expertise to scale rapidly and efficiently. The involvement of such high-profile figures naturally draws considerable attention, placing American Bitcoin firmly in the spotlight as it prepares to deploy its newly acquired capital. This strategic alliance positions American Bitcoin as a formidable new entity, ready to compete at the highest levels of the digital asset mining industry. The Power of a $220 Million Crypto Investment A $220 million capital raise is a colossal sum in any industry, but in the volatile yet rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market, it signifies profound confidence and strategic intent. This substantial crypto investment empowers American Bitcoin to execute a dual-pronged strategy: first, the direct purchase of Bitcoin, and second, the acquisition of advanced digital asset mining equipment. The direct BTC purchase indicates a bullish long-term outlook on Bitcoin’s value, allowing the company to hold a significant treasury of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. This strategy not only positions them to benefit from potential price appreciation but also provides a strong balance sheet asset. Simultaneously, investing in state-of-the-art mining hardware will dramatically enhance their operational efficiency and hash rate, positioning them as a major player in the global mining arena. This move reflects a calculated approach to capitalize on both the appreciation of digital assets and the profitability of their creation. Such a large injection of capital can also have ripple effects, potentially boosting investor sentiment across the wider crypto ecosystem, signaling that significant capital is still keen on the sector’s growth. The sheer scale of this funding round suggests an aggressive expansion strategy, potentially enabling American Bitcoin to acquire existing mining farms, secure long-term energy contracts, or even develop new, more efficient mining facilities from the ground up. This war chest provides a significant competitive advantage in a capital-intensive industry. Why Bitcoin Mining is Attracting Such Major Funds? Despite market fluctuations, increasing network difficulty, and the recent Bitcoin halving event, Bitcoin mining continues to attract substantial investment for several compelling reasons. At its core, mining offers a direct path to acquiring newly minted BTC, providing a hedge against market volatility through consistent asset generation. The business model, when optimized, can yield significant returns, especially for operations with access to cheap, sustainable energy and efficient hardware. Here are key factors driving this investment: Direct Asset Accumulation: Miners earn block rewards (newly minted BTC) and transaction fees, providing a steady income stream. This allows companies to accumulate Bitcoin directly, benefiting from its long-term price appreciation without needing to buy it on the open market. Infrastructure Play: Investing in mining equipment and data centers is an investment in the foundational infrastructure of the Bitcoin network itself. As the network grows, so does the value of its underlying infrastructure. Operational Efficiency & Scale: Large-scale operations can achieve economies of scale, negotiating better electricity rates and bulk discounts on hardware. The race for efficiency, driven by advancements in ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) Circuit) technology, means newer, more powerful machines can generate more BTC per unit of energy. Geopolitical Shifts: Following China’s crackdown on mining, North America has emerged as a dominant hub for Bitcoin mining, attracting significant investment due to a more stable regulatory environment and abundant energy resources. However, it’s not without its challenges. The increasing network difficulty, rising energy costs, and the need for constant hardware upgrades demand significant capital and operational expertise. Companies like American Bitcoin, with their substantial funding, are better positioned to navigate these hurdles, leveraging economies of scale and advanced technology to maintain profitability in an increasingly competitive landscape. This funding also provides a buffer against market downturns, allowing them to continue operations when smaller miners might struggle. Beyond BTC: The Scope of Digital Asset Mining While Bitcoin remains the king of cryptocurrencies, the term digital asset mining encompasses a broader spectrum of activities. This could include mining other proof-of-work (PoW) cryptocurrencies that still rely on computational power for network security and transaction validation. While Ethereum has moved to Proof-of-Stake, there are still numerous altcoins that can be profitably mined, offering diversification for large-scale operations. The strategic allocation of funds towards ‘digital asset mining equipment’ suggests American Bitcoin’s foresight in building a versatile mining operation capable of adapting to future market trends and technological advancements beyond just Bitcoin. This diversification strategy allows companies to: Mitigate Risk: Reduce reliance on a single asset’s price performance by spreading operations across various mineable cryptocurrencies. If one asset’s profitability declines, others might still be lucrative. Explore New Opportunities: Capitalize on emerging blockchain networks and their native tokens. As new PoW chains launch, early entry into their mining can yield substantial returns. Optimize Hardware Usage: Utilize specialized or general-purpose mining equipment for various algorithms. Some mining rigs can be repurposed or reconfigured to mine different coins, maximizing hardware utility. Adapt to Market Shifts: The ability to pivot between different mineable assets provides flexibility in response to changes in network difficulty, token prices, or energy costs. The emphasis on “digital asset mining equipment” indicates a forward-thinking approach, recognizing that the crypto landscape is dynamic. It suggests an investment not just in current profitability, but in building a resilient and adaptable mining infrastructure ready for the next wave of innovation in the decentralized world. This adaptability is crucial for long-term sustainability in the fast-paced crypto industry, allowing American Bitcoin to capture value from a wider range of digital assets. The ‘Trump Crypto’ Connection: What It Means for the Market The involvement of Eric Trump, a direct descendant of a former U.S. President, undeniably adds a unique dimension to this venture. The ‘ Trump crypto ‘ connection brings an unprecedented level of mainstream attention to the digital asset space. This high-profile endorsement, even indirectly, could have several significant implications, transcending typical market dynamics and touching upon broader societal perceptions of cryptocurrency: Increased Mainstream Awareness and Legitimacy: The association could draw new demographics into the cryptocurrency conversation, moving it further from niche discussions into broader public discourse. For many, the involvement of a well-known political family might lend an air of legitimacy to an asset class still viewed with skepticism by some traditional investors. It signals that digital assets are becoming increasingly integrated into established financial and political spheres. Potential for Political Influence and Regulatory Dialogue: While direct policy influence is speculative, high-profile figures with vested interests in crypto could indirectly shape future regulatory landscapes or at least highlight the industry’s growing importance to policymakers. Their participation could lead to more nuanced discussions about regulation, energy consumption, and the economic benefits of fostering a robust crypto industry within the United States. Shifting Public Perceptions: For some, this connection might further legitimize crypto as a serious investment class, attracting more conservative investors. For others, it might raise questions about political influence in financial markets or spark debates about the environmental impact of mining, given the political spotlight. Regardless of the viewpoint, it ensures that cryptocurrency remains a topic of public interest and debate. Investor Confidence: For certain segments of the investor community, the involvement of a figure like Eric Trump might instill a sense of confidence, believing that such ventures are backed by significant resources and connections. This could potentially attract more capital from traditional investment pools. It’s a fascinating development that underscores how deeply intertwined traditional power structures are becoming with the burgeoning digital economy. This confluence of politics and finance could accelerate the adoption curve, but also potentially invite greater scrutiny and shape the narrative around cryptocurrency’s role in the global economy. The ‘Trump crypto’ narrative will undoubtedly be a talking point, influencing how both the public and policymakers perceive the industry moving forward. Actionable Insights and The Road Ahead For investors, this news highlights the continued institutional confidence in Bitcoin and the broader digital asset ecosystem. It underscores the potential for well-funded, strategically managed mining operations to thrive even in challenging market conditions. It also serves as a reminder of the significant capital and expertise often required for large-scale ventures in this sector. For those considering involvement in crypto, this event emphasizes the increasing integration of digital assets into mainstream finance and political spheres, suggesting a future where they play an even more central role. The road ahead for American Bitcoin, while bolstered by significant funding, will involve navigating the inherent volatilities of the crypto market, managing energy costs, adapting to technological advancements, and responding to evolving regulatory landscapes. Their success will not only be a testament to their operational prowess but also a key indicator of how political connections can influence the trajectory of major crypto ventures. American Bitcoin’s monumental $220 million capital raise marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry. Backed by the strategic partnership of Eric Trump and Hut8, this venture is poised to significantly expand its footprint in Bitcoin and digital asset mining. It’s a powerful testament to the enduring appeal and growth potential of digital assets, demonstrating that even amidst market cycles, substantial capital is flowing into the foundational infrastructure of the decentralized future. This development will undoubtedly be watched closely by investors, industry insiders, and the public alike, as it charts a new course for high-profile engagement in the crypto space, solidifying the industry’s march towards mainstream acceptance and innovation.

2025-07-01T14:30:17,"Goldman Sachs Says One Catalyst Could Reverse Stagnant US Manufacturing Productivity – And It’s Not Tariffs: Report","US banking titan Goldman Sachs reportedly says that there’s one catalyst that can spark an American manufacturing resurgence. Goldman says in a note to investors that artificial intelligence (AI) advancements have massive potential to boost US manufacturing, reports Fortune. Says Goldman analysts, including Joseph Briggs, “A pickup in the pace of innovation – potentially from recent advances in robotics and generative AI – therefore remains the catalyst most likely to reverse the long-run stagnation in manufacturing productivity.” Goldman analysts say AI is a much better bet for a US manufacturing boost than the tariffs that US President Donald Trump is pushing, claiming that the taxes on imported goods will return manufacturing to the USA and increase jobs. “Tariffs are unlikely to result in much reshoring because production costs in other countries are well below the US for most products (even after accounting for tariffs), and China will likely continue to grow its exports on the back of cost advantages and industrial policy support.” Briggs also emphasizes the need for the US to ramp up its efforts in advancing factory automation. “This is one of the key technologies that I think could drive productivity growth in a cost-competitive manner.

""If Trump Didn't Exist…"" – Bitcoin (BTC) Moved!","FED Chairman Jerome Powell made new statements about interest rates and tariffs. Speaking at the ECB Central Banking Forum, organized annually by the European Central Bank (ECB) and held in Sintra, Portugal, the Fed President said that the US economy is in good shape and inflation is moving towards the 2 percent target. Jerome Powell said the U.S. economy is in solid shape and inflation is moving as expected when excluding the effects of tariffs. He stated that the FED paused interest rate cuts to see the impact of the tariffs and that waiting was the right approach as long as the economy remained strong. Powell added that if it weren't for Donald Trump's tariffs, they would have cut rates by now. “The U.S. economy is in good shape and inflation continues to decline toward the 2 percent target. If we leave the tariffs aside, we can say that inflation is moving in the direction we want. When we saw the size of customs duties, we started to wait for interest rate cuts. In the current situation, we think the best thing to do before starting to cut interest rates is to wait and get more information. “We are seeing a gradual cooling in the labor market. But it has not reached the level we wanted.” July Signal for Interest Rate Cuts! Powell said the vast majority at the Fed expect a rate cut later this year, but he noted it was not yet clear whether July was too early to cut rates. “I can't say whether July is too early to cut interest rates. I wouldn't take the possibility of a rate cut off the table at any meeting, it just depends on the data,” Powell said. We Would Have Lowered Interest Rates Long Ago! Powell finally answered the question: “Would you lower interest rates if there were no tariffs?” Powell responded to this question in a way that would anger Trump, saying, “If it weren't for Trump's tariffs, we would have lowered interest rates by now.” Related News: FED Chairman Jerome Powell Seems the Way!

Although Powell did not give a clear date for interest rate cuts, Bitcoin rose from $106,400 to over $107,000 in the last minutes after he signaled softening. Trump and Powell Fight! Donald Trump harshly criticizes Powell's interest rate policies, while arguing that the economy is in good shape and emphasizing that interest rate cuts are necessary. At this point, Trump emphasizes that there should be aggressive interest rate cuts to stimulate the economy, while Powell continues to insist that interest rates should not be changed and should proceed depending on the data due to concerns about inflation and instability caused by tariffs. *This is not investment advice.

Why has Bloomberg’s XRP ETF Approval Rating Jumped to 95% Bloomberg analysts, led by Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, have dramatically boosted dramatically boosted their odds of a U.S. spot XRP ETF approval to 95 %, citing strong indicators of regulatory momentum and institutional appetite The SEC’s ongoing engagement with 19b‑4 filings—marked by amendment requests and public comment calls—signals a cooperative shift, with the Bloomberg analysts interpreting it as growing recognition of XRP under a commodity framework, much like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Heavyweights like Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, and 21Shares have all filed XRP spot ETF applications. Rumors have also been swirling about BlackRock’s game-changing potential in this area. Their combined involvement adds both legitimacy and institutional rigor to the process. A successful XRP ETF could unlock billions in inflows, with some forecasts projecting inflows between $4.4 billion and $8.3 billion by 2026 as projected by leading banking giant Standard Chartered. Therefore, a spot XRP ETF is not just a new investment vehicle, it’s a gateway to institutional adoption, price growth, and legitimacy for XRP in global financial markets. It's a powerful signal that XRP is evolving from a speculative token to a recognized digital asset. XRP Whales Go on a Buying Spree According to market analyst Jungle Inc, “This chart shows the relationship between whale flows (in millions) and XRP price over time.From Aug–Dec 2024, whale flows shift from strongly negative to positive (+250M), coinciding with a steep XRP price rally from ~$0.50 to ~$3.00 — suggesting whales accumulate before price surge.” The analyst added, “May–June 2025: whale flows turn positive again (+300M), while price stabilizes around $2.00 — hinting at potential repeat of the prior rally cycle.In short: whales accumulate heavily before rallies and reduce positions as prices peak — their flows often precede major moves.” With whale flows turning positive, there is a high likelihood that large holders are anticipating an upward price movement and are positioning themselves early, with this move usually deemed smart money activity. Therefore, XRP whales are quietly but aggressively accumulating, signaling long-term conviction underpinned by growing on-chain utility and improved regulatory outlook. Their strategic moves are reshaping supply dynamics, and if sustained, may set the stage for a major breakout in the months ahead. In the past month alone, whales holding between 10–100M XRP scooped up more than 420M XRP worth a whopping $915M, while another cohort added at least 260 million XRP, illustrating robust diversified accumulation across different whale brackets. Combined with earlier Q2 accumulation of around 900M XRP, this reflects a sustained push higher. Record-Breaking Whale Wallet Surge On‑chain analytics reveal a historic milestone: over 2,700 wallets now hold more than 1 million XRP , the highest ever in XRP’s 12‑year existence. This scale of concentration indicates large players and institutions are injecting capital and confidence into XRP at an unprecedented pace. On the other hand, Daily active addresses on the XRP Ledger skyrocketed from 40K to an astonishing 295K, representing a 7-fold increase. Surging transaction volume driven by new use cases in decentralized finance (DeFi), tokenization, and cross‑border flows is translating on‑chain utility into credible long‑term demand. Conclusion Bloomberg’s 95% XRP ETF outlook reflects a deliberate and structured regulatory shift coupled with institutional and market alignment.

2025-07-01T14:10:35,"Crypto Stocks Soar: Unveiling the Potential for a New S&P 500 Sector","BitcoinWorld Crypto Stocks Soar: Unveiling the Potential for a New S&P 500 Sector Are you watching the markets closely? If so, you’ve likely noticed a seismic shift in the financial landscape. Recent data from crypto analytics firm 10x Research reveals that U.S.-listed crypto stocks have not just performed well, they’ve exploded, rising an astounding 119% year-to-date. This surge isn’t just a fleeting trend; it’s a powerful indicator of a broader market evolution, potentially paving the way for a dedicated S&P 500 crypto sector . What does this mean for investors and the future of finance? Why Are Crypto Stocks Outperforming Traditional Assets? The remarkable 119% year-to-date increase in U.S.-listed crypto equities, as highlighted by 10x Research, isn’t just a statistic; it’s a testament to a growing confidence in the digital asset space. This performance has notably outpaced Bitcoin (BTC) itself, as well as many traditional asset classes. But what’s driving this impressive surge? Institutional Influx: The entry of major financial players, particularly through Bitcoin spot ETFs, has legitimized crypto as an investable asset class. This has funneled significant capital into companies operating within the crypto ecosystem. Maturity of the Ecosystem: Beyond just Bitcoin, the entire crypto infrastructure has matured. Companies involved in mining, exchanges, blockchain technology development, and digital asset management are now more robust, generating tangible revenues and profits. Regulatory Clarity (Emerging): While still evolving, the regulatory landscape is slowly but surely becoming clearer. This reduces uncertainty for institutional investors and allows crypto-focused companies to operate with more defined parameters. Technological Advancements: Continuous innovation in blockchain technology, DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 applications is creating new revenue streams and opportunities for these companies, fueling investor optimism. These factors combine to create a compelling narrative for why crypto stocks are not just surviving, but thriving, positioning them as attractive investments for both traditional and crypto-native portfolios. The Road to an S&P 500 Crypto Sector : What Does it Mean? The idea of a dedicated S&P 500 crypto sector is more than just a theoretical concept; it signifies a profound shift in how Wall Street views digital assets. Currently, companies with significant crypto exposure are often classified under existing sectors like Technology or Financials. A dedicated sector would acknowledge crypto as a distinct and significant economic force. What would a new S&P 500 sector entail? Enhanced Visibility and Legitimacy: Inclusion in a major index like the S&P 500 provides unparalleled visibility and validates crypto as a mainstream investment. It would signal to the world that digital assets are here to stay. Dedicated Investment Vehicles: A new sector would likely spur the creation of specialized ETFs, mutual funds, and other financial products focused solely on crypto equities, making it easier for a wider range of investors to gain exposure. Benchmarking and Analysis: It would provide a clear benchmark for the performance of crypto-related companies, allowing for more precise analysis and comparison within the financial industry. Increased Capital Inflow: Institutional investors whose mandates are tied to S&P 500 sector allocations would be compelled to consider investments in this new sector, potentially driving massive capital into the space. This potential reclassification reflects Wall Street’s growing comfort and strategic backing of digital asset firms , laying the groundwork for a truly integrated crypto economy within traditional finance. Examining Digital Asset Investments : Key Players and Trends The landscape of digital asset investments is diverse, extending far beyond just holding Bitcoin or Ethereum. It encompasses a wide array of companies that are building the infrastructure, services, and applications for the decentralized future. These companies are the backbone of the surging crypto equities market. Who are some of the key players driving this growth? Mining Operations: Companies like Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) are at the forefront of Bitcoin mining, benefiting directly from BTC price appreciation and network activity. Exchanges and Trading Platforms: Coinbase (COIN) stands out as a leading publicly traded crypto exchange, providing vital access points for millions of users to buy, sell, and store digital assets. Blockchain Technology Developers: Firms focused on developing underlying blockchain infrastructure, scaling solutions, and enterprise-level blockchain applications. While many are private, some publicly traded tech companies are heavily investing in this area. Digital Asset Management: Companies like MicroStrategy (MSTR), known for its substantial Bitcoin holdings, and others that offer custodial services or investment products for institutional clients. The trend is clear: traditional finance is not just observing; it’s actively participating and building. This includes partnerships between established banks and crypto firms, the development of tokenized assets, and the exploration of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), all contributing to the broader narrative of digital asset investments becoming mainstream. The Rise of Blockchain Equities : Opportunities and Challenges The term blockchain equities specifically refers to publicly traded companies whose core business revolves around blockchain technology or significant exposure to digital assets. While they offer exciting opportunities, investors must also be aware of the unique challenges associated with this nascent sector. Opportunities: Exposure to Innovation: Investing in blockchain equities allows investors to gain exposure to cutting-edge technology and the rapid innovation happening in the decentralized space, without directly holding volatile cryptocurrencies. Diversification: For traditional portfolios, these equities can offer a new avenue for diversification, potentially uncorrelated with traditional market movements in the long term. Growth Potential: As blockchain technology finds more real-world applications across various industries (supply chain, finance, healthcare), the growth potential for these companies is substantial. Regulatory Clarity Benefits: Companies that successfully navigate and adapt to evolving regulations stand to benefit significantly as the industry matures. Challenges: Volatility: While potentially less volatile than direct crypto holdings, blockchain equities are still highly sensitive to cryptocurrency price fluctuations and broader market sentiment. Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite progress, regulatory frameworks remain fragmented globally, posing risks for companies operating across jurisdictions. Competition: The sector is highly competitive, with new startups and established tech giants vying for market share. Valuation Challenges: Traditional valuation metrics may not always fully capture the growth potential or risks of these innovative, often early-stage, businesses. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for anyone considering investments in blockchain equities , ensuring a balanced perspective on their potential. Driving Institutional Crypto Adoption : Wall Street’s Shifting Stance The narrative of institutional crypto adoption has dramatically evolved from skepticism to strategic embrace. Wall Street’s subtle yet undeniable backing of digital asset firms is the cornerstone of the current market shift. This isn’t just about financial institutions buying Bitcoin; it’s about integrating crypto into the very fabric of traditional finance. Key aspects of this shifting stance include: Bitcoin Spot ETFs: The approval and subsequent success of Bitcoin spot Exchange Traded Funds have been a game-changer. These products allow institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin through regulated, familiar investment vehicles, bypassing the complexities of direct crypto ownership. Custodial Services: Major banks and financial service providers are increasingly offering secure custodial solutions for digital assets, addressing a critical need for institutional investors concerned about security and compliance. Blockchain Integration: Beyond crypto, financial institutions are exploring and implementing blockchain technology for various use cases, including faster cross-border payments, trade finance, and tokenized securities. Talent Acquisition: Traditional financial firms are actively recruiting blockchain and crypto experts, signaling a long-term commitment to the space. Venture Capital Investments: Wall Street firms and their venture arms are pouring capital into promising crypto startups and infrastructure projects, betting on future growth. This deepening involvement from Wall Street indicates a fundamental belief in the long-term value and disruptive potential of digital assets, driving the momentum for companies within the crypto ecosystem and strengthening the case for a dedicated S&P 500 sector. Conclusion: A New Era for Finance The remarkable 119% surge in U.S.-listed crypto equities is more than just a market anomaly; it’s a powerful signal that the digital asset revolution is maturing and gaining undeniable traction within traditional finance. The prospect of an S&P 500 crypto sector isn’t just a dream; it’s becoming an increasingly tangible reality, driven by robust performance, increasing institutional engagement, and the ongoing evolution of blockchain equities . This shift promises enhanced legitimacy, greater investment accessibility, and a clear benchmark for a rapidly expanding industry. As digital asset investments continue to proliferate and institutional crypto adoption accelerates, we are witnessing the dawn of a new era where digital assets are no longer fringe but integral to the global financial system. Investors, both new and seasoned, would do well to pay close attention to this transformative trend, as it reshapes portfolios and redefines the future of finance.

2025-07-01T14:05:00,"Bitcoin: Price Stays Range-Bound, But July Sentiment Hints At Potential Bullish Breakout (Technical Analysis)","Summary Bitcoin bearish engulfing pattern signals hesitation below $108,800. Bulls look for momentum to challenge supply zone resistance. July seasonal trends and S&P 500 record highs add to Bitcoin bullish backdrop. By Sholanke Dele Bitcoin price action has kept traders on edge over the past week, as the cryptocurrency stayed locked in a narrow range below the supply zone at $108,800 and above the support at $106,500. Over the weekend, price attempted a rally but struggled to push beyond this ceiling, reflecting hesitation among buyers to commit above the resistance level. On Monday, Bitcoin slipped to a three-day low, forming a bearish engulfing candlestick pattern that signals potential weakness. This pattern is particularly important since it emerged from a rejection at the upper boundary of the bearish channel, which aligns directly with the supply zone at $108,800. Such technical confluence highlights how sellers used this area to reinforce their control, putting downward pressure on price and pushing it closer to the crucial support zone. BTC price dynamics (January - June 2025). Source: TradingView Tuesday’s Asian and European sessions saw further downward movement, as Bitcoin fell below the previous day’s low to reach an intraday bottom near $106,700. However, the decline found support at the 50 EMA on the four-hour chart, helping price stabilize. During the European session, Bitcoin slightly recovered to trade near $107,000, hovering close to the day’s opening level. This stabilization shows that despite recent bearish signals, there is still a layer of support preventing an immediate breakdown. Bitcoin July bias turns bullish as S&P 500 correlation strengthens risk appetite The area around $106,500 has held firm so far, providing a psychological floor that could serve as a springboard for a potential move higher. If this level continues to withstand selling pressure, it could act as a base for bulls to attempt another breakout above the bearish channel. A successful push beyond $108,800 would signal renewed momentum and might attract sidelined investors looking for confirmation of strength. Looking at broader factors, July carries a bullish undertone for Bitcoin. Historical data suggests that Bitcoin tends to follow positive seasonal trends in July, and this sentiment is further supported by a rising correlation with the S&P 500. The S&P 500 recently reached an all-time high, hinting that risk appetite across markets is improving. As investor confidence strengthens in equities, Bitcoin could benefit from spillover optimism, creating conditions that favor a breakout attempt. In summary, Bitcoin currently stands at a critical juncture, held up by solid support while technical signals point to hesitation above resistance. The convergence of technical setups and broader market sentiment sets the stage for a potentially decisive move in July, one that could define the next chapter of its price trajectory.

2025-07-01T14:02:32,"Best Crypto to Buy Now as MicroStrategy and MetaPlanet Continue Accumulating Bitcoin","While retail sentiment stutters and price charts move sideways, the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin are pushing forward with quiet urgency. The market has cooled off in recent weeks, but that has done little to shake conviction among institutions that view Bitcoin not as a trade but as an operating principle. This past week, both MicroStrategy and MetaPlanet added substantially to their already enormous holdings. These are not small increments. These are bold entries, issued without hesitation. What this signals is simple: volatility is noise for those with long-range vision. And if the largest Bitcoin buyers in the world are pressing forward during moments of uncertainty, then it may be time to question what they see coming that most retail investors still do not. Inside the Accumulation - MetaPlanet’s Leap and Strategy’s Momentum In a span of just months, MetaPlanet has transitioned from an upstart treasury experiment to one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin on the planet. Its latest purchase of 1,005 BTC for $108 million pushed its total to 13,350 BTC, a position now valued at $1.45 billion. This surpasses the holdings of CleanSpark, Tesla, Coinbase, and Block. MetaPlanet did not arrive here slowly. It arrived through conviction and by moving when others hesitated. *Metaplanet Acquires Additional 1,005 $BTC , Total Holdings Reach 13,350 BTC* pic.twitter.com/a6aNMV9weD — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) June 30, 2025 The company CEO Simon Gerovich’s team entered at an average of roughly $97,000 per coin, with recent buys near $107,000. Still, they remain up nearly 350% on the year. In corporate finance, that is an anomaly. In Bitcoin strategy, that is starting to look normal. And yet MetaPlanet’s rise only reinforces the lead of MicroStrategy. Now holding 597,325 BTC, Michael Saylor’s company has amassed over $42 billion worth of Bitcoin, acquired at an average of just under $71,000. Their recent addition of nearly 5,000 more coins only extends the message: they are not done yet. This is no longer a question of who is dabbling. It is a race to see who is accumulating faster and who refuses to stop. Best Crypto to Buy Now – Tokens That Could See Major Adoption SUBBD Adoption does not always follow infrastructure. Sometimes, it follows a narrative. SUBBD recognizes this and leans fully into what might be the next major frontier for crypto integration: content-native social reputation. Rather than building a platform around tokens and bolting on a creator economy afterward, SUBBD starts at the source. It is a content-first ecosystem built to reward originality, engagement, and cultural credibility, and it does so through an organic blend of token incentives and creator-led discovery. What sets SUBBD apart is not just its format but also its instinct. In a world where audience trust is scattered across platforms and attention spans, SUBBD gives creators a direct stake in their own cultural output. The more a user contributes to shaping discourse, the more weight their reputation carries, and that reputation is not ephemeral. It is on-chain. It is portable. And it is incentivized. At the time of writing, SUBBD has managed to onboard several leading models in the space and has been endorsed by top creators like ClayBro and many others as well. In a cycle where even traditional institutions are treating Bitcoin as a long-term store of strategic value, projects like SUBBD could represent the next phase of adoption, not by mimicking corporate treasuries but by rebuilding digital economies around individual influence. If mass adoption is truly coming, it will not just be banks and hedge funds shaping its pace. It will be the creators, the curators, and the culture-drivers who take it to the mainstream. SUBBD is not waiting to be invited to that table. It is already building its own. TOKEN6900 The growing institutional adoption of cryptocurrency could set the stage for a full-fledged bull market in Q3 2025. In such a scenario, low-caps that sit perfectly at the intersection of meme and market are expected to see significant growth, potentially delivering jaw-dropping returns to early buyers. Among such projects is TOKEN6900 , an Ethereum-based meme coin inspired by the success of SPX6900. Unlike most meme coins, this project is not feigning any utility. Rather, it taps into the “6900” thunder - the same mystical force that turned SPX6900 into a multi-billion dollar token - to fuel its storm. The addition of a staking feature further amplifies TOKEN6900’s market appeal, laying the groundwork for it to “out-meme, out-degenerate, and potentially out-pump” its predecessor. It is therefore not without reason that it is being viewed by several experts as one of the top cryptocurrency picks for the next bull run. Best Wallet Token If custody is king in crypto, then wallet solutions are its frontline monarchs. But not all wallets are built to lead. Best Wallet Token , with its Bitcoin Wallet ecosystem enters the space with a clear mission, not to offer just another storage solution but to reimagine what a high-functioning Web3 wallet can do. With its native token powering features and governance, Best Wallet is engineered to scale alongside the very adoption curve that institutions are now accelerating. Security is assumed. What sets Best Wallet apart is usability and intent. The interface feels closer to a mainstream fintech app than a clunky DeFi dashboard. Yet it retains full decentralization where it matters. From integrated swaps to token tracking and ecosystem onboarding, the wallet functions as both gateway and guide, especially for users just beginning their journey into self-custody. 🔥 Over $13M Raised and Counting! 🔥Best Wallet is becoming the go-to for traders who want speed, simplicity, and early access to what matters:✅ Buy new tokens early, directly in-app✅ Buy and bridge across chains in one place✅ Full portfolio control, no clutterDownload… pic.twitter.com/0SDNVPov6v — Best Wallet (@BestWalletHQ) June 4, 2025 But it is the token mechanics that give this project its larger utility arc. Token holders are not just spectators. They gain a role in shaping upgrades, unlocking features, and potentially earning rewards from in-wallet services. As regulatory clarity increases and more individuals begin to self-custody their assets, tools like Best Wallet may become the default onboarding layer for the next ten million users. In that context, the Best Wallet Token is not just a utility coin. It is the bridge between interface and ownership, between usability and user influence. And if the infrastructure boom continues, this token may be sitting right where utility meets inevitability. Snorter Crypto adoption will not scale through exchanges alone. It will spread through platforms people already use every day, and that is precisely the angle Snorter is built around. This Telegram-based bot does not aim to pull users into a new app. It goes where they already are, layering AI and Web3 functionality into a channel people check more often than their inbox. Snorter is not trying to be a bot for everything. It is trying to be a tool for those who actually use crypto. With smart contract integration, live market data, conversational interfaces, and wallet commands baked into one compact Telegram assistant, Snorter transforms idle chats into actionable crypto workflows. You do not need to leave the app to check balances, send tokens, query tokens, or ask for trend analysis. You just type, and it responds in real time in plain language. But what makes Snorter more than a novelty is how well it aligns with broader adoption trends. As crypto moves from institutional cold storage to retail experimentation, accessibility becomes key. And accessibility lives where users are active. By collapsing multiple functions into a single intelligent agent inside Telegram, Snorter lowers the barrier to engagement and turns friction into fluency. If crypto is going to become something people actually use, not just hold, then projects like Snorter could lead that behavioral shift, not by pushing users to adapt but by adapting to where they already spend their time. Bitcoin Hyper The phrase “Bitcoin Layer 2” used to carry a narrow meaning, mostly confined to scaling or payments. But Bitcoin Hyper reframes the concept entirely. It is not just building faster transaction rails on top of Bitcoin. It is building a high-performance, Bitcoin-native environment designed to unlock a much larger vision: programmable functionality without compromising the base layer’s core integrity. This project does not treat Bitcoin as a fossil to be preserved. It treats it as infrastructure to be extended. Bitcoin Hyper operates as a parallel engine, enabling smart contract capabilities and decentralized applications while anchoring trust in the most secure chain on earth. That alone places it in a rare category, which is a Bitcoin-aligned ecosystem with Ethereum-like flexibility. At the time of writing, the project has crossed the $1 million milestone in its presale, sitting at more than $1.6 million in raised funds. So, investors have also started to realize that where the institutional crowd sees Bitcoin as a treasury asset, Bitcoin Hyper sees it as a launchpad. This is the kind of positioning that allows the project to live in two timelines at once: aligned with the conservative nature of Bitcoin’s monetary philosophy while also serving the experimental pace of newer blockchain architectures. What sets Bitcoin Hyper apart is not just compatibility. It is vision. By creating a scalable, composable layer that remains fully tethered to Bitcoin’s value base, it opens the door for real adoption, not just from developers but eventually from companies and networks looking for secure settlement without starting from scratch. Conclusion In a cycle increasingly defined by institutional clarity and high-conviction accumulation, the opportunity for individual investors is no longer about chasing hype. As the biggest corporate players expand their holdings, the market also adjusts accordingly while trying to shake off retail investors. The projects highlighted above reflect this shift, but are still in a phase where retail investors have a chance to get in while cheap. They are functional ideas built for an active future. For those looking to position early, now may be the moment to start paying closer attention. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

2025-07-01T14:01:08,"Critical Move from Avalanche (AVAX)! Signed a New Partnership in the Country Expected to Lift the Bitcoin ETF Ban!","While partnership news continues to come in the cryptocurrency market, the latest news came for the altcoin Avalanche (AVAX), which is closely followed by Turks. Accordingly, South Korean fintech foreign exchange platform Travel Wallet signed a cooperation agreement with Avalanche. Travel Wallet has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with layer-1 blockchain platform Avalanche to develop a Korean won-based stablecoin, local news agency Naver reported. As part of the partnership, Travel Wallet plans to issue a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the Korean won and use smart contracts to design a programmable stablecoin. As part of the collaboration, Travel Wallet and Avalanche plan to build a stablecoin-based next-generation financial payment infrastructure that can be applied in all areas for both consumers and businesses. This infrastructure can be used in areas such as integrated online and offline payments, B2B settlements for corporate customers, and financial automation solutions at home and abroad. Travel Wallet CEO Kim Hyung-woo said: “This project is an attempt to reimagine the way finance works with technology, beyond digital payments. It has great potential to expand into a global payments infrastructure and domestically in the future. “Based on technological reliability and regulatory compliance, we will build a stable stablecoin ecosystem that can be used both domestically and internationally.” As is known, the new president of South Korea, Lee Jae-myung, promised during his election campaign that the issuance, stock exchange listing and trading of spot ETFs based on crypto assets such as Bitcoin would be allowed. At this point, South Korean authorities will work to fulfill newly elected President Lee Jae-myung’s cryptocurrency promises. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) aims to prepare a plan for spot ETF promotion in the second half of the year and complete the regulatory system related to stablecoins in the same period. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-01T14:00:58,"BitMine Stock Soars 700% After $250 Million Raise For Ethereum Treasury","Tom Lee, the market strategist known for his insightful predictions on Bitcoin (BTC) and broader crypto prices, has taken on the role of chairman of the board at BitMine Immersion Technologies, a Bitcoin mining company now setting its sights on becoming the largest publicly traded holder of Ethereum (ETH). Tom Lee Appointed Chairman At BitMine Lee’s appointment comes alongside an ambitious plan to raise $250 million in a private placement aimed at implementing a strategy that positions Ethereum as the primary treasury reserve asset, while still maintaining its core Bitcoin mining operations. This initiative reflects a growing trend within the financial services sector, where the convergence of traditional finance and cryptocurrency is gaining momentum, further highlighted by President Trump’s decision to establish a strategic crypto reserve. Related Reading: Solana Forms Bullish Flag On Daily Chart — Breakout Imminent? Lee highlighted this shift during an appearance on CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” stating, “The financial services industry and crypto are converging, and it really started with stablecoins.” Lee likened stablecoins to the “ChatGPT of crypto,” emphasizing their widespread adoption among consumers, businesses, and financial institutions, including major players like Visa. Interestingly, stablecoins have gained a major victory in Congress last week with the passage of the GENIUS Act which aims to provide a new regulatory framework for these crypto assets. Transforming Into An Ethereum Treasury Powerhouse According to Lee, Ethereum serves as the foundational architecture for stablecoins, making it crucial for BitMine to accumulate ETH in order to influence and secure its position within the network. The company’s strategy will include monitoring the value of Ethereum held per share as a key performance metric, akin to Strategy’s (previouisly MicroStrategy) well-known “BTC Yield” metric for Bitcoin. During his interview, Lee explained that BitMine plans to enhance the value of ETH per share through reinvestment of cash flows, capital market activities, and the appreciation of Ethereum itself. As more companies explore treasury management strategies beyond Bitcoin, BitMine is not alone in its pivot. It joins other firms like SharpLink Gaming, which initiated its own Ethereum treasury strategy earlier this year, and DeFi Development, which is focusing on Solana. Related Reading: Wave 3 Ignites As XRP Breaks Structure—Analyst Says ‘Fireworks Ahead’ This announcement sparked a major surge for the Bitcoin mining company which started the day with a market capitalization of just $26 million. However, following Lee’s interview, the number skyrocketed beyond the $200 million mark. BitMine’s stock, trading under the ticker name BMNR, also saw a major surge on Monday closing the day at $33.90 per share. According to Yahoo Finance data, this means a nearly 700% surge for the mining firm’s shares. On the other hand, Ethereum has retraced 1% below the key $2,500 level in the 24-hour time frame to its current price of $2,470 per token.

2025-07-01T14:00:44,"XRP, Solana, Litecoin ETF Approval Odds Raised To 95% By Bloomberg","Bloomberg Intelligence’s James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have upgraded their outlook for a swathe of single-asset spot-crypto exchange-traded funds, taking the headline odds for XRP, Solana (SOL) and Litecoin (LTC) to 95 percent for approval by the end of 2025. Posting the revised forecast on X late on 30 June, Seyffart wrote : “Here are mine and Eric Balchunas’ most recent odds on spot crypto ETF approvals by the end of 2025. We expect a wave of new ETFs in this second half of 2025.” Bloomberg Raises XRP, Solana, Litecoin ETF Odds To 95% The analysts’ latest matrix assigns identical 95 percent odds to four categories: XRP, SOL, LTC and a separate “basket/index” product that would convert Grayscale, Bitwise, Hashdex and Franklin vehicles holding multiple tokens into spot ETFs. Each of those filings has already had its initial Rule 19b-4 submission acknowledged by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and each faces a final SEC decision in early July (for the basket product) or in mid-October 2025 (for the three single-asset funds). Directly behind the front-runners sit Dogecoin , Cardano, Polkadot, Hedera (HBAR) and Avalanche, all marked at 90 percent. Canary-filed Sui is judged a coin-flip at 60 percent, while Tron and the micro-cap token Pengu each remain at 50 percent, reflecting open questions around commodity status and the absence of CFTC-regulated futures. The new 95 percent figure is the third upward revision in as many months. On 20 June Balchunas and Seyffart lifted most altcoin ETFs to “90% or higher”, citing “remarkably positive” engagement from SEC staff. Back in late April, the same analysts still pegged SOL at 70 percent and XRP at just 65 percent, a level they themselves called “an improved outlook” compared with February ’s sub-60 percent assessments. In percentage-point terms, XRP and LTC have therefore gained roughly thirty points since the start of the year, while SOL is up 25. Three dynamics underpin the latest bump: First, there’s the impending decision on Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) . The SEC must decide by 2 July whether to allow NYSE Arca to list shares of GDLC, a $730 million vehicle that holds Bitcoin, Ether and a combined 8 percent slice of XRP, SOL and Cardano. Seyffart told Blockworks that the agency could “let the product through” precisely because the non-BTC/ETH allocation is modest; “if they’re not approved on this first date, it’ll only be because the SEC isn’t ready with a full framework,” he said blockworks.co. ETF Store president Nate Geraci went further, writing via X that approval is “highly likely” and would create a “low-risk sandbox” for the SEC to gather surveillance data before green-lighting standalone altcoin funds. In every case where Seyffart assigns 90 percent or more, the underlying token already trades on a Commodity Futures Trading Commission-regulated venue and has been implicitly treated as a commodity in recent SEC correspondence. The agency’s acknowledgement of the relevant 19b-4 filings, Seyffart argues, “suggests that the underlying altcoins are likely viewed as commodities” The third positive sign is the active, iterative dialogue with issuers. Multiple sponsors — including Canary, VanEck, 21Shares and Fidelity — have filed amended S-1s at the SEC’s request over the past month. Seyffart and Balchunas see that level of back-and-forth as the same pattern that preceded spot-Bitcoin approval in January 2024 and spot-Ether approval seven months later. If GDLC wins the nod this week, attention will swing quickly to the single-asset queue. The SEC’s final deadline for Solana is 10 October 2025; XRP and Dogecoin come up on 17 October; Litecoin on 2 October; Cardano on 23 October; Polkadot on 8 November; Hedera on 11 November; and Avalanche on 12 December. Sui’s file runs to 21 December, while the first substantive decision on Tron is not due until 23 January 2026, and Pengu stretches to 12 March 2026.

2025-07-01T14:00:32,"Ethereum’s Resurgent Futures Volume Signals Explosive Investor Confidence","BitcoinWorld Ethereum’s Resurgent Futures Volume Signals Explosive Investor Confidence The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with a significant shift: Ethereum (ETH) futures volume is now nearly on par with Bitcoin (BTC). This isn’t just a statistical blip; it’s a powerful indicator of a dramatic resurgence in investor confidence in the leading smart contract platform. For months, whispers of Ethereum losing its edge circulated, but recent data paints a very different picture, suggesting a renewed belief in ETH’s long-term potential within the broader crypto market . According to data from The Block, the ETH/BTC futures volume ratio has soared to an impressive 98%. This figure marks a remarkable recovery from a low of 42% observed in October 2024. That earlier decline had sparked concerns, leading many to question Ethereum’s continued dominance as the premier smart contract platform. However, the current rebound strongly suggests a powerful narrative shift, driven by strategic advancements, widespread adoption of scaling solutions, and robust decentralized finance (DeFi) activity. Ethereum’s Ascent: A Closer Look at Futures Volume Parity What exactly does this surge in futures volume signify? Futures contracts are financial instruments that allow investors to speculate on the future price of an asset without owning the underlying asset itself. High trading volume in futures markets often indicates strong institutional interest, increased speculation, and a general belief in an asset’s future price movements. When Ethereum’s futures volume begins to mirror that of Bitcoin, it suggests that large players and sophisticated investors are allocating significant capital and attention to ETH. The journey from 42% to 98% in a relatively short period is not accidental. It reflects a fundamental reassessment of Ethereum’s value proposition. While Bitcoin has cemented its status as ‘digital gold’ and a primary store of value, Ethereum is increasingly viewed as the foundational layer for the decentralized internet – Web3. This distinction is crucial, as it positions ETH as a high-growth, innovation-driven asset, distinct from BTC’s more mature, inflation-hedge narrative. Historically, Bitcoin has dominated the crypto derivatives market, often serving as the bellwether for overall market sentiment. Ethereum’s ability to close this gap indicates a diversification of institutional interest and a growing recognition of its unique utility and ecosystem strength. This parity suggests that the market is no longer solely looking to Bitcoin for directional cues but is now equally considering Ethereum’s trajectory. Why is Investor Confidence Surging in ETH? The renewed investor confidence in Ethereum isn’t based on hype alone; it’s rooted in tangible developments and a clear strategic vision. Several key factors are contributing to this positive sentiment: Strategic Direction and Network Upgrades: The successful transition to Proof-of-Stake with The Merge was a monumental achievement, significantly reducing Ethereum’s energy consumption and paving the way for future scalability upgrades like sharding. This strategic shift has de-risked the network from an environmental perspective and demonstrated the core development team’s ability to execute complex, multi-year roadmaps. The upcoming ‘Dencun’ and ‘Prague’ upgrades promise further enhancements to scalability and user experience. Wider Adoption of Layer-2 Scaling Solutions: Ethereum’s mainnet (Layer 1) can face congestion and high transaction fees during peak demand. Layer-2 (L2) scaling solutions, such as Optimistic Rollups (e.g., Arbitrum, Optimism) and Zero-Knowledge Rollups (e.g., zkSync, StarkNet), have become increasingly mature and widely adopted. These L2s process transactions off-chain and then batch them back to the mainnet, dramatically increasing throughput and reducing costs. This has made the Ethereum ecosystem more accessible and efficient for everyday users and developers alike. Many decentralized applications (dApps) are now deploying directly on L2s, effectively expanding Ethereum’s capacity. Growing Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Activity: DeFi remains a cornerstone of the Ethereum ecosystem. Despite market fluctuations, innovation in DeFi continues unabated. New lending protocols, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), liquid staking derivatives, and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization initiatives are constantly emerging. This vibrant activity attracts more users and capital, reinforcing Ethereum’s position as the hub for financial innovation. The Total Value Locked (TVL) in Ethereum-based DeFi protocols remains substantial, showcasing persistent user engagement. NFTs and Gaming Ecosystem: While the NFT market has cooled from its peak, Ethereum remains the primary blockchain for high-value NFTs and a growing number of blockchain-based games. The infrastructure provided by Ethereum and its L2s supports complex digital economies, attracting artists, creators, and gamers, further solidifying its utility beyond just financial applications. Potential for Ethereum ETFs: The anticipation of a spot Ethereum ETF in major markets (similar to Bitcoin ETFs) is also a significant driver of institutional interest. If approved, such ETFs would provide traditional investors with regulated and accessible avenues to gain exposure to ETH, potentially unlocking a massive influx of capital and further validating Ethereum as a legitimate asset class. Bitcoin’s Maturing Dominance and the Shifting Crypto Market Landscape While Bitcoin continues to hold its ground as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, its narrative is indeed maturing. For many, BTC represents a digital store of value, an alternative to traditional fiat currencies, and a hedge against inflation. Its volatility has decreased over time, and its adoption by institutional players and even some nation-states has grown significantly. However, this maturity also implies that its exponential growth phases might be less frequent or dramatic compared to earlier cycles. The market is constantly evolving. As Bitcoin solidifies its role, attention naturally shifts to other assets that offer higher growth potential and innovative utility. Ethereum, with its programmable blockchain, extensive developer community, and diverse application ecosystem, fits this description perfectly. Investors are increasingly looking beyond just ‘digital gold’ to assets that power the next generation of internet applications and financial services. This doesn’t imply a decline in Bitcoin’s importance, but rather a diversification of the crypto market ‘s focus. The ecosystem is growing, and different assets are finding their distinct niches. Bitcoin might be the reliable foundation, but Ethereum is emerging as the dynamic engine of innovation, attracting capital from those seeking higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities within the digital asset space. Consider the different roles these two giants play: Feature Bitcoin (BTC) Ethereum (ETH) Primary Role Digital Gold, Store of Value Programmable Blockchain, Web3 Infrastructure Consensus Mechanism Proof-of-Work (PoW) Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Tokenomics Fixed Supply (21M), Halving Cycles Deflationary (post-Merge), EIP-1559 Burning Scalability Layer-1, Lightning Network Layer-1, Robust Layer-2 Ecosystem Ecosystem Focus Payments, Digital Scarcity DeFi, NFTs, Gaming, dApps, Enterprise Solutions Navigating the Future: Opportunities and Challenges for Ethereum The future looks promising for Ethereum , but it’s not without its complexities. Understanding both the opportunities and challenges is crucial for any investor. Opportunities: Scalability and User Growth: With L2s maturing and future upgrades like sharding on the horizon, Ethereum’s capacity to handle a massive influx of users and transactions will only improve. This opens the door for mainstream adoption of dApps. Developer Dominance: Ethereum boasts the largest and most active developer community in the blockchain space. This ensures continuous innovation, security audits, and a robust pipeline of new applications and features. Deflationary Pressure: Post-Merge, and with EIP-1559’s fee-burning mechanism, Ethereum’s supply can become deflationary under certain network conditions, potentially increasing the scarcity and value of ETH over time. Institutional Adoption: Beyond futures, growing interest from traditional finance for staking, DeFi, and potential ETFs could funnel significant capital into the Ethereum ecosystem. Challenges: Competition from Other L1s: While Ethereum is dominant, it faces strong competition from other Layer-1 blockchains (e.g., Solana, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain) that offer different trade-offs in terms of speed, cost, and decentralization. Regulatory Scrutiny: The evolving global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies poses an ongoing challenge. Clarity on how ETH and DeFi protocols will be classified and regulated is still developing. Execution Risks of Future Upgrades: While the Ethereum core developers have an excellent track record, future complex upgrades always carry some degree of technical risk. User Experience Complexity: Despite L2s, the overall user experience for interacting with decentralized applications can still be daunting for newcomers, requiring multiple wallets, bridging assets, and understanding gas fees. Centralization Concerns: While the Merge significantly reduced energy consumption, it also introduced new centralization vectors related to staking pools and validator distribution that the community continues to monitor and address. Actionable Insights for Investors: Diversify Your Portfolio: While Bitcoin remains foundational, consider a diversified crypto portfolio that includes Ethereum and other promising altcoins, aligning with the shifting market dynamics. Understand Layer-2s: Familiarize yourself with the various Layer-2 solutions and their ecosystems. Many future innovations and user activity will happen on these networks. Monitor On-Chain Metrics: Keep an eye on network activity, TVL in DeFi, and transaction volumes on both Layer 1 and Layer 2s to gauge the health and growth of the Ethereum ecosystem. Practice Risk Management: The crypto market remains volatile. Invest only what you can afford to lose and consider dollar-cost averaging strategies. The remarkable surge in Ethereum’s futures volume , now standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Bitcoin, is a powerful testament to renewed investor confidence . This isn’t just a fleeting trend; it reflects a fundamental shift in the crypto market ‘s focus, driven by Ethereum’s strategic advancements, the widespread adoption of Layer-2 scaling solutions, and its thriving DeFi ecosystem. As Bitcoin’s narrative matures, Ethereum is increasingly seen as the dynamic engine of innovation, attracting significant capital and attention as the leading contender among higher-risk, higher-reward crypto assets. Its journey from a period of doubt to a position of strength underscores its pivotal role in shaping the decentralized future. The future of the crypto landscape appears increasingly multi-polar, with Ethereum firmly established as a co-pilot alongside Bitcoin.

The network is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the software that powers the Ethereum blockchain, allowing Ethereum-based applications and smart contracts to be copied and pasted onto Bitcoin, developer Botanix Labs said in an email. Botanix is one of several projects attempting to scale the Bitcoin blockchain and make it a more conducive venue for decentralized finance (DeFi) by enhancing its utility and programmability. Others include Rootstock, Stacks and BOB (""Build on Bitcoin""), which have all adopted the BitVM computing paradigm that can make complex computations verifiable on Bitcoin, paving the way for smart-contract provision, similar to Ethereum's. The expansion of Bitcoin's utility would allow developers to take advantage of the value held in BTC, which dwarfs that of all other digital assets . ""Fully decentralized"" BTCFi Botanix Labs also emphasized its decentralized governance structure. The mainnet launch coincides with its transition to being operated by a foundation of 16 node operators. Botanix said it expects the number to grow beyond 100 in 2026. The founding federation includes some of the biggest names in cryptocurrency , including as Mike Novogratz's financial services firm Galaxy Digital and crypto custody specialist Fireblocks. ""If we want a world that runs on Bitcoin, we have to build systems that honor its core principles of self-custody, open participation and global fault tolerance,” Botanix Labs CEO Willem Schroé said. “Too many Bitcoiners have been burned by centralized platforms, which is why Botanix is fully decentralized at launch. No single party, including us, can touch a user’s Bitcoin."" Several products that will form the basis of Botanix's Bitcoin DeFi (BTCFi) offering also debuted in conjunction the mainnet launch.

2025-07-01T13:59:21,"American Express delays payments amid Fed upgrade, Ripple XRP use speculated","American Express has announced a major system upgrade that is currently causing delays in cross-border payments and wire transfers. The move, aimed at aligning its infrastructure with a broader Federal Reserve update, has reignited speculation in crypto circles that Ripple’s blockchain-powered payment technology may soon be integrated into Amex’s systems. The speculation is not new—American Express and Ripple previously collaborated on cross-border payment trials, and the recent infrastructure overhaul has reopened conversations about whether RippleNet or XRP could become part of the payments giant’s future plans. Amex’s modernisation push follows crypto partnership American Express has been making a series of sweeping changes, including a refresh on its Platinum cards in what it calls the “largest investment ever in a Card refresh.” The update impacts both its US Consumer and Business Platinum Cards and includes enhanced spending flexibility and new reward structures. While this overhaul is focused on customer-facing services, it coincides with significant backend changes to its payments network. Earlier this month, Amex entered the crypto rewards space through a partnership with Coinbase. The launch of the Coinbase One Card offers users up to 4% cashback in Bitcoin on purchases, while also providing access to Amex-style perks such as exclusive event invites.

It marks a shift towards wider adoption of blockchain and digital currencies in traditional finance. Ripple rumours resurface as delays persist Although Amex has not officially confirmed any new collaboration with Ripple, crypto market commentators such as Versan, the founder of Black Swan Capitalist, highlighted the company’s history with Ripple and questioned whether XRP-powered solutions could be part of the new architecture. Versan | Black Swan Capitalist @VersanAljarrah · Follow #BREAKING : American Express issued a notice to clients regarding delays in cross-border payments and wire transfers, citing a“Federal Reserve System update” and a “wide system upgrade.”Payment infrastructure is being modernized, and American Express is a known Ripple partner. 8:51 AM · Jul 1, 2025 2.3K Reply Copy link Read 29 replies In a recent post on X, Versan linked the payment delays, system upgrade, and Amex’s ongoing relationship with Ripple as “strategic alignment.” RippleNet, Ripple’s flagship global payment network, is known for enabling instant and cost-efficient cross-border settlements. American Express had previously tested Ripple’s blockchain in partnership with Santander, raising the possibility of renewed collaboration as Amex upgrades its infrastructure to compete with global fintechs. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.20, marking a 1% gain over the past 24 hours. The modest price movement comes amid wider speculation that Ripple may see renewed institutional adoption if Amex confirms blockchain integration. Legal uncertainties remain for Ripple despite SEC talks Meanwhile, Ripple continues to navigate its long-running legal case with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Last week, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse stated that the company has decided to drop its cross-appeal in the case. The SEC is also expected to withdraw its appeal, as it had previously indicated. However, a request from both Ripple and the SEC for an indicative ruling to reduce Ripple’s $125 million civil penalty was denied. The ruling also declined to reverse an earlier judgment that labelled Ripple’s institutional sales of XRP as securities transactions. In her ruling, US District Judge Analisa Torres said that Ripple’s attempt to “push the boundaries” of the prior summary judgment showed a potential for further violations. Ripple’s chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty, said that the company had a choice: drop its appeal or continue contesting the securities ruling. Despite the legal complexities, Alderoty emphasised that XRP’s status “as not a security” has not changed. Ripple will continue to operate as normal, he added. The dual developments—Ripple’s legal resolution efforts and American Express’ infrastructure overhaul—have together renewed investor focus on the role blockchain may play in reshaping traditional finance.

2025-07-01T13:42:19,"Bitcoin faces rejection — Bearish Divergence signals breakdown potential","Bitcoin is showing signs of exhaustion at the $108,350 resistance zone. With a developing bearish divergence, declining volume, and repeated failures to break higher, price action is at risk of rotating lower toward key support. Bitcoin ( BTC ) has spent the past week consolidating under a major resistance zone near $108,350 — a level that aligns with the value area high of the current trading range. Despite attempts to push higher, price remains capped. Now, a bearish divergence is developing, suggesting the recent rally is losing momentum. If sellers step in at this level, it could trigger a rotation back toward the value area low around $100,960. Key technical points $108,350 Resistance Zone: High time frame resistance with value area high confluence Bearish Divergence: RSI is making lower highs while price pushes higher Declining Volume Profile: Lack of strong demand to break resistance structure BTC/USDT (4H) Chart | Source: TradingView Bitcoin’s rejection from $108,350 has formed a potential lower high, continuing a bearish structure that has been unfolding over the past several weeks. The level itself represents a significant barrier, with multiple rejections confirming it as a supply-heavy zone. Without a decisive breakout, the price is more likely to rotate within the established range. The bearish divergence — where price pushes slightly higher while the RSI weakens — is a typical early warning of exhaustion. This divergence is especially significant when it occurs at key resistance, as it suggests bulls are running out of steam. It also signals that the recent rally may have been driven more by short-term momentum than sustained buying interest. You might also like: DOJ busts four North Korean hackers in $900K crypto theft Volume has been steadily declining throughout this consolidation. In the context of technical resistance and divergence, this weakening volume reinforces the bearish bias. For a breakout to occur, strong volume would need to confirm a shift in demand. Without that, price is more likely to roll over and test the next key support — the point of control and eventually the value area low at $100,960. What to expect in the coming price action As long as Bitcoin remains below $108,350, the bias leans bearish. A confirmed rejection backed by increasing sell volume could trigger a clean rotation down toward $100,960. If that level fails, further downside toward the previous swing low may unfold. Alternatively, a reclaim of $108,350 on strong volume would be the first bullish signal and could invalidate the current bearish setup.

Is a major rally awaiting once this dip is complete? $BTC bulls gathering for big push to the upside Bitcoin (BTC) has already touched the top of its bull flag and the price has been rejected. All perfectly serene in the grand scheme of things, given that overbought signals were flashing as the $BTC price had become overstretched.

At a level of support now at $106,500, the price could even start reversing back up from here. However, this would be quite a shallow correction, only barely reaching the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level. It would be perfectly reasonable for the bears to bring the price down further, to the $106,000, or even the $104,400 horizontal support level, but with the 4 and 8-hour Stochastic RSI indicators already at the bottom, and the 12-hour nearly there, the $106,000 support level looks to be favourite for the coming bounce.

The previous two patterns, the bull flag and the falling wedge, experienced a lot of consolidation before finally breaking out explosively to the upside. The latest bull flag is smaller, and could be expected to break out a lot quicker. As already mentioned, this current dip down to the horizontal support band could be the last one before the next skyward move up to $120,000 to $130,000.

2025-07-01T13:30:31,"Connecticut’s Decisive Bitcoin Ban: Unpacking the Impact of HB7082","BitcoinWorld Connecticut’s Decisive Bitcoin Ban: Unpacking the Impact of HB7082 The digital asset world is constantly evolving, and with it, the regulatory landscape. A recent development from the Nutmeg State has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency community: Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont has officially signed a significant piece of legislation into law. This move marks a crucial moment for state-level engagement with virtual currencies, particularly with the new Connecticut Bitcoin ban now on the books. What does this mean for the future of digital assets within the state, and what are the broader implications? Understanding the New Connecticut Bitcoin Ban and HB7082 On July 1, Governor Ned Lamont put his signature on what has been widely dubbed the “Bitcoin Reserve Ban.” This legislation, officially known as HB7082 legislation , isn’t just a simple prohibition; it’s a comprehensive directive outlining the state’s stance on digital assets. At its core, the law explicitly prevents the state of Connecticut from: Accepting Virtual Currencies: The state treasury or any state agency cannot accept Bitcoin or other virtual currencies as payment for taxes, fees, or any other state-related transactions. Holding Virtual Currencies: The state is prohibited from holding virtual currencies in its reserves or any official accounts. This means no state-owned Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any other digital asset. Investing in Virtual Currencies: State funds, including pension funds or investment portfolios managed by the state, are barred from investing in virtual currencies. This aims to insulate state finances from the inherent volatility often associated with crypto markets. Beyond these direct prohibitions, HB7082 also introduces significant new requirements for money transmitters Connecticut operates within its borders. These new stipulations are designed to enhance consumer protection and regulatory oversight, ensuring that entities dealing with virtual currencies adhere to strict operational guidelines. This aspect of the law underscores a growing trend among states to regulate the flow of digital assets, even if they choose not to embrace them at a state level. Why This Virtual Currency Law? Exploring Connecticut’s Stance You might be wondering, what prompted Connecticut to take such a definitive step against virtual currencies? While the official reasoning often centers on fiscal prudence and risk management, several factors likely played a role in the enactment of this virtual currency law : Volatility Concerns: Cryptocurrencies are known for their price swings. States, often tasked with managing public funds responsibly, tend to be risk-averse. Prohibiting direct state exposure to volatile assets like Bitcoin is seen as a way to safeguard taxpayer money from potential downturns. Regulatory Uncertainty: The federal regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Without clear, comprehensive federal guidelines, individual states are left to craft their own rules. Connecticut’s move can be interpreted as a cautious approach in an uncertain environment. Consumer Protection: While the ban primarily targets state interaction with crypto, the added requirements for money transmitters reflect a broader concern for consumer safety. Ensuring licensed entities operate transparently and securely is a key objective for state regulators. Preservation of Traditional Financial Systems: Some policymakers may view widespread state adoption of virtual currencies as a potential destabilizer to existing financial frameworks, preferring to maintain reliance on established fiat systems. This approach contrasts sharply with states like Wyoming or Texas, which have explored more crypto-friendly policies, aiming to attract blockchain innovation. Connecticut’s decision highlights the diverse and often conflicting views on digital assets across the United States. The Broader Implications of Connecticut’s State Crypto Policy The signing of HB7082 is more than just a local news item; it’s a significant indicator of evolving state crypto policy in the U.S. What are the ripple effects of such a ban? Impact on State Finances and Innovation From Connecticut’s perspective, the immediate ‘benefit’ is perceived risk mitigation. By avoiding direct exposure to virtual currencies, the state aims to shield its treasury from potential market downturns. However, this cautious approach also means the state potentially misses out on future growth opportunities that digital assets might offer. It could also signal a less welcoming environment for blockchain companies or crypto startups looking to establish a presence, potentially directing innovation elsewhere. Challenges for Money Transmitters in Connecticut For businesses operating as money transmitters Connecticut , the new requirements under HB7082 will necessitate operational adjustments. These entities, which facilitate the transfer of funds including virtual currencies, will likely face: Increased Compliance Burden: More stringent reporting, licensing, and operational standards. Enhanced Scrutiny: Closer oversight from state regulators regarding their virtual currency activities. Potential Operational Costs: Implementing new compliance measures often comes with additional expenses. This could make it more challenging for smaller crypto-focused money transmitters to operate profitably in the state, potentially leading to consolidation or a shift in business models. A Precedent for Other States? Connecticut’s move could influence other states contemplating their own crypto regulations. While some might see it as a blueprint for risk aversion, others might view it as an overly restrictive approach that stifles innovation. The ongoing debate surrounding digital asset regulation at both federal and state levels means that every new law, like HB7082, adds another layer to the complex tapestry of crypto governance in the U.S. Navigating the Future of State Crypto Policy The signing of the Connecticut Bitcoin ban into law by Governor Lamont serves as a powerful reminder that while cryptocurrencies aim for decentralization, they are still very much subject to traditional governmental oversight. This move reinforces the idea that states are increasingly taking active roles in defining their relationship with digital assets, rather than waiting for federal mandates. For residents and businesses in Connecticut, understanding the nuances of this law is key. While individuals are not prohibited from owning or trading virtual currencies, the state itself has drawn a clear line in the sand regarding its own interaction with them. This creates a distinct regulatory environment that participants in the crypto space must acknowledge. As the digital economy continues to mature, we can expect more states to weigh in on virtual currency regulation. Whether they follow Connecticut’s cautious path or opt for a more embracing stance, these legislative decisions will collectively shape the future of crypto adoption and innovation across the nation. It’s a dynamic landscape where policy decisions today will have lasting impacts on tomorrow’s digital financial ecosystem.

The last purchase came on June 24, when the UK-based web design firm purchased another 196 BTC . The purchase is part of a growing trend where smaller companies are diversifying into Bitcoin to become more attractive to investors. Specifically, Smarter Web Company is originally a web design firm that has since moved into BTC. Smarter Web Company stock price and trading volume | Source: Aquis The strategy was successful, bringing its share price from £4.5 in April to a peak of £500 in June. Still, the firm has also shed 50% of its value since its peak. London-listed firms join Bitcoin treasury race Several London-listed firms are launching their own Bitcoin treasuries , irrespective of their core business. For instance, AI services firm Tao Alpha announced plans to raise £100 million from investors to buy Bitcoin. Tech firms are not the only companies entering the race. Panther Metals, a natural resources company, announced that it had bought one Bitcoin. The firm’s shares were up 81% in June, despite it reporting a £2.2 million loss in 2024. Bitcoin treasuries seem an attractive way for firms to make traders interested in their stock price. Still, according to FT, most of these firms are small-cap and loss-makers, with very small trading volumes. This means that their share price can take off very quickly. However, the firms are also susceptible to major corrections.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded net inflows for the 15th consecutive day, attracting a total of $4.7 billion in capital in the process. Bitcoin ETF Entry Series Continues for Day 15: Total Nears $5 Billion BlackRock’s IBIT fund alone raised $3.8 billion, accounting for 81% of total inflows over the 15-day period. IBIT alone saw net inflows of $112.3 million on Monday, the last trading day of June. Ark Invest and 21Shares’ ARKB fund saw outflows of $10.2 million on the same day, while no transactions were made in the other funds. ETF Store President Nate Geraci said in his statement on the X platform, “There has been money inflow into spot Bitcoin ETFs for 15 consecutive days. We are approaching $5 billion in total. Not this year, just in the last 15 trading days.” Geraci also reminded that this level is the ceiling that some analysts think spot ETFs can reach in their first year. But the momentum of inflows has weakened. Monday’s net inflow of $102.1 million was well below Friday’s $501.2 million and below the 15-day average of $316 million per day. In total, spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted $49.3 billion in net inflows since their launch in January 2024, while attracting $13.8 billion in capital since the beginning of the year, with total assets under management reaching $128 billion. Ethereum ETFs Continue to Rise Spot Ethereum ETFs also saw net inflows of $31.8 million on the same day, with $25.7 million of that amount flowing into Fidelity’s FETH fund. Launched in July 2024, Ethereum ETFs have seen net inflows totaling $4.2 billion to date. Bitcoin briefly rose above $108,000 over the weekend but has since retreated to $106,707 at the start of the week, while Ethereum is currently trading at $2,457 after testing above $2,500. BRN Chief Analyst Valentin Fournier said the slowdown in ETF inflows could indicate waning short-term institutional interest: “This weakens the possibility of Bitcoin breaking above $112,000 anytime soon. However, the medium-term outlook remains positive, especially as institutional treasuries accelerate their Bitcoin purchases.” According to experts, although price action has weakened in the short term, Bitcoin's upside potential remains intact as institutional investors continue to show interest. *This is not investment advice.

The latest update from CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index reveals a significant shift, signaling that the crypto market is firmly in Bitcoin Season . This crucial metric, now standing at a low 21, indicates a period where Bitcoin’s performance overshadows that of most alternative cryptocurrencies. Understanding this shift is vital for anyone navigating the dynamic world of digital assets. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Tell Us About Cryptocurrency Trends? The Altcoin Season Index , a widely tracked metric by CoinMarketCap (CMC), provides a clear snapshot of the prevailing sentiment and performance within the crypto market . On July 1, 00:31 UTC, the index registered a score of 21, a slight dip from the previous day’s figure. This low score is a strong indicator that we are currently experiencing a Bitcoin Season . But how exactly does this index work? It’s quite straightforward: The index analyzes the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization on CoinMarketCap over the past 90 days. Crucially, it excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens to provide a pure measure of speculative asset performance. For the market to be considered in Altcoin Season , at least 75% of these top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin during the specified period. Conversely, a Bitcoin Season is declared when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to surpass Bitcoin’s performance. The index scores range from 1 to 100, with higher numbers indicating stronger altcoin performance relative to Bitcoin. A score of 21 clearly places us deep within Bitcoin’s territory. This metric serves as an essential guide for investors, helping them gauge the overall health and direction of cryptocurrency trends , especially concerning the capital flow between Bitcoin and altcoins. Why Is Bitcoin Dominating the Crypto Market Right Now? The current low reading on the Altcoin Season Index isn’t just a random fluctuation; it reflects underlying forces at play in the broader crypto market . Several factors contribute to Bitcoin’s dominance during a Bitcoin Season : Macroeconomic Uncertainty: In times of global economic instability or high inflation, investors often flock to assets perceived as ‘safe havens.’ Bitcoin, with its larger market cap and established track record, tends to attract capital looking for stability, even within the volatile crypto space. Institutional Interest: A significant portion of institutional investment flows directly into Bitcoin, especially with the advent of spot Bitcoin ETFs. This sustained institutional demand provides a strong foundational support for Bitcoin’s price, often without spilling over into the broader altcoin ecosystem immediately. Liquidity and Market Depth: Bitcoin boasts unparalleled liquidity compared to most altcoins. This makes it easier for large players to enter and exit positions without significantly impacting the price, reinforcing its status as the primary trading pair for many altcoins. Halving Cycle Influence: While not immediate, the post-halving period for Bitcoin often sees a consolidation phase followed by a potential parabolic rise. During this consolidation, altcoins might struggle to gain traction as attention remains on Bitcoin’s price action. Flight to Quality: When the market experiences a downturn or heightened uncertainty, investors tend to reduce exposure to riskier, smaller-cap altcoins and reallocate capital into Bitcoin, which is perceived as less volatile relative to other cryptocurrencies. These combined factors create an environment where Bitcoin acts as the primary driver of the crypto market , absorbing liquidity and attention, which in turn leads to the low Altcoin Season Index score we observe today. Navigating Bitcoin Season: Smart Strategies for Your Altcoin Investments With the Altcoin Season Index signaling a firm Bitcoin Season , it’s natural for altcoin holders to feel a pinch. However, this period also presents unique opportunities for strategic investors. Here are some actionable insights to consider for your altcoin investments : Re-evaluate Your Portfolio: Take this time to assess your altcoin holdings. Are they fundamentally strong projects with real utility and active development? Projects with solid fundamentals are more likely to weather a Bitcoin Season and potentially rebound stronger. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market bottom, consider implementing a DCA strategy for altcoins you believe in. Regularly investing a fixed amount, regardless of price, can average out your purchase price over time, reducing risk. Focus on High-Conviction Projects: During periods of Bitcoin dominance, capital tends to flow into the most robust and innovative altcoin projects. Research emerging narratives, technological breakthroughs, and strong communities that could lead the next wave of Altcoin Season . Risk Management is Key: Volatility can be extreme in a Bitcoin Season . Avoid over-leveraging and ensure your position sizes are appropriate for your risk tolerance. Diversifying across different altcoin sectors (DeFi, NFTs, Layer 2s, Gaming) can also help mitigate risk. Accumulate Bitcoin: Paradoxically, a Bitcoin Season is an excellent time to accumulate more Bitcoin. If Bitcoin continues its upward trajectory, your Bitcoin holdings will appreciate, and you can then strategically reallocate profits into altcoins when the market shifts. By adopting a disciplined and informed approach, you can navigate the current cryptocurrency trends and position yourself for future success, even when the Altcoin Season Index is low. When Will Altcoin Season Return? Analyzing Future Cryptocurrency Trends The burning question for many is: when will the Altcoin Season Index climb back up, signaling the return of a vibrant Altcoin Season ? While no one can predict the future with certainty, historical patterns and market indicators can offer clues about potential triggers for a shift in cryptocurrency trends : Bitcoin Price Consolidation: Historically, a strong Altcoin Season often follows a period where Bitcoin’s price consolidates after a significant rally. This stability allows capital to rotate from Bitcoin into altcoins, seeking higher returns. Increased Market Liquidity: A significant influx of new capital into the overall crypto market , often driven by positive macroeconomic news or broader adoption, can lift all boats, including altcoins. Major Technological Breakthroughs: Breakthroughs or significant upgrades within specific altcoin ecosystems (e.g., Ethereum’s upgrades, new Layer 2 solutions gaining traction) can attract fresh investment and spark rallies. Regulatory Clarity: Positive regulatory developments or a clear framework for digital assets can instill confidence, leading to increased investment across the board, benefiting altcoins disproportionately due to their higher growth potential. Retail Investor Enthusiasm: A renewed surge in interest from retail investors, often fueled by social media buzz and mainstream media coverage, can drive demand for altcoins. Observing these factors and keeping a close eye on the Altcoin Season Index itself will be crucial indicators for when the winds of the crypto market begin to shift back in favor of altcoins. Patience and continuous research are key during this waiting period. Conclusion: Navigating the Shifting Tides of the Crypto Market The current reading of 21 on the Altcoin Season Index clearly signals that the crypto market is in a definitive Bitcoin Season . This period, characterized by Bitcoin’s outperformance, is a natural phase in the cyclical nature of digital assets. While it might present challenges for those solely invested in altcoins, it also offers strategic opportunities for informed investors.

2025-07-01T13:20:23,"Bitcoin (BTC) Made History in Q2 but What’s Next?","TL;DR After a standout second quarter, Bitcoin has solidified its status as the leading force in the cryptocurrency market. The cryptocurrency has also achieved a considerable, albeit symbolic, milestone. The Impressive Performance in Q2 Despite the volatility, the primary cryptocurrency has experienced considerable success over the past three months. Its valuation hit an all-time high of almost $112,000 towards the end of May, while its market capitalization shot well above $2 trillion. Moreover, BTC closed on June 30 at around $107,500, marking a 30% gain for Q2 alone. While there have been quarters when Bitcoin gained more, t his represents the highest quarterly closing price in the asset’s history. Highest quarterly close ever for BTC pic.twitter.com/4H79pmcLiq — CRG (@MacroCRG) July 1, 2025 The surge over the last few months might be substantial, but some vital metrics suggest there might be more room for growth in the short term. BTC’s exchange netflow, for instance, has been predominantly negative in the past 30 days, suggesting that investors have been moving assets from centralized platforms toward self-custody methods. This , in turn, reduces the immediate selling pressure. BTC Exchange Netflow, Source: CryptoQuant Rising inflows into spot BTC ETFs add to the bullish momentum. According to SoSoValue, these products have attracted billions of dollars in recent weeks, underscoring sustained investor appetite and institutional confidence. BTC ETFs Netflow, Source: SoSoValue Price Forecasts The sentiment across the crypto community is also quite optimistic. X user BiBull recently claimed BTC is likely preparing for its “final leg up,” envisioning a surge above $160,000 sometime this year. Cas Abbe and KALEO made bullish predictions , too . The former thinks the cryptocurrency is still in “the expansion phase,” forecasting a “big pump” in the following weeks. “Once BTC breaks above $110K, it’ll pump 15%-20% within a matter of weeks,” the analyst said. For their part, KALEO assumed that the asset’s price may reach a new historic peak in the next seven days.

On the other hand, though, there have been some warning signs popping up as well.

2025-07-01T13:19:59,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Slips Below $107,000 As Tariff Deadline Looms","Bitcoin (BTC) slipped below $107,000, starting the week in the red as markets turned cautious ahead of the July 9 US tariff deadline. Broader market sentiment was mixed, with several altcoins registering sharp declines, while others registered marginal increases. The flagship cryptocurrency is down nearly 1% in the past 24 hours, trading around $106,540. Strategy Acquires Another $530M Worth Of Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin treasury company Strategy has acquired another 4,980 BTC for $531.9 million, taking its total stash to 597,325 BTC , valued at over $64 billion. The purchase comes at an average price of $106,801 per BTC . The company has financed recent purchases through a mix of capital raised via common stock (MSTR) and newly issued preferred stock (STRK and STRF). The stocks are part of the company’s at-the-market equity programs. These efforts reflect an $84 million capital raise initiative under Strategy’s 42/42 plan, which will fund Bitcoin purchases until 2027. Strategy founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor is bullish about Bitcoin. Speaking at the BTC Prague conference, he claimed the flagship cryptocurrency could rise to $21 million over the next 21 years. Strategy’s average Bitcoin purchase price sits at $70,982 per coin, resulting in over $21 billion in unrealized gains. The company’s Bitcoin stash has made it the largest publicly traded Bitcoin treasury. Bitcoin (BTC) Sets Record June Close Bitcoin (BTC) closed June in the red, dropping over 1%. However, it held above $107,000 on Monday, closing at $107,167 to achieve its highest monthly close in history. This is a significant milestone for the flagship cryptocurrency, surpassing previous record monthly closes of $104,600 in May and $102,450 in January. Despite the record monthly close, analysts point out that the June candle formed a “pin bar” pattern, characterized by a small body and extended wicks. Bitcoin Miners’ Market Cap Rises The market capitalization of the 13 US-listed Bitcoin mining companies crossed $28 billion on June 27, a 23% month-over-month increase. The growth was driven by miners with high-performance computing (HPC) exposure after reports that CoreWeave was exploring the acquisition of Core Scientific. Despite the jump, the seven-day rolling average network hashrate on June 27 was over 100 EH/s below levels recorded in May. Analysts believe US operators, including Riot, Cipher, and IREN, reduced operations due to the recent heatwave and the resulting increases in spot power pricing. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has started the week in the red as markets turn cautious thanks to the July 9 tariff deadline. The flagship cryptocurrency traded in positive territory over the weekend, registering marginal increases on Friday and Saturday. Price action picked up on Sunday as BTC registered an increase of almost 1% to cross $108,000 and settle at $108,350. However, market sentiment changed on Monday, and the price fell over 1% to $107,167. BTC is down 0.50% during the ongoing session, trading at $106,630. BTC supply in profit registered a sharp increase, rising from 87% to 98% between June 22 and Sunday, according to data from Grassnode. Over 96% of all Bitcoin were in profit as of Tuesday. Historically, such high levels have led to market volatility as profit taking grows. For instance, BTC fell from $109,000to $74,000 between January and April, a drop preceded by the profitable supply rising to 98.8% on January 21. Profitability data also reflects bullish yet cautious market conditions, with the realized profit/loss ratio rising from 1.1 to 2.8, crossing the high band threshold of 2.4. Meanwhile, Bitfinex analysts believe BTC’s rally is losing steam as buying pressure fades and traders lock in their profits. BTC has surged over 40% since dropping to its year-to-date low of $73,273. However, Bitfinex analysts stated that momentum is starting to fade. “For the first time in that uptrend, momentum has begun to fade.” The analysts believe that on-chain metrics and order flow data suggest BTC may be entering a period of consolidation after reaching a local top, with “continued vertical acceleration” on the sidelines for now. “Spot volume has cooled, taker buy pressure has weakened, and profit-taking has intensified — especially among short-term holders who rode the move from sub-$80,000 levels.” However, some analysts, like economist Donald Dean, believe BTC is preparing to move to $130,000. “ BTC - Getting Ready to Move Price Target: $130,981. BTC is getting ready to move higher with tight consolidation at the volume shelf. Also, Cup and Handle. Next target is at the Golden Ratio $130k.” BTC price action was bearish over the previous weekend, dropping 1.18% on Friday and 1.17% on Saturday to settle at $102,180. The price plunged below $100,000 on Sunday as bearish sentiment intensified, falling to a low of $98,385 before recovering to reclaim $100,000 and settle at $100,985. Price action turned bullish as BTC rose over 4% on Monday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,443. Buyers retained control on Tuesday as the price rose 0.66% to cross $106,000 and settle at $106,137. BTC crossed $107,000 on Wednesday after registering an increase of 1.19% and settling at $107,397. Source: TradingView BTC lost momentum on Thursday, dropping 0.39%, slipping below $107,000, and settling at $106,980. It recovered to register marginal increases on Friday and Saturday to reclaim $107,000 and settle at $107,339. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as BTC registered an increase of nearly 1% to cross $108,000 and settle at $108,350. However, BTC started the current week in the red as markets turned cautious thanks to the July 9 tariff deadline looming. As a result, the price fell by over 1% to $107,167.
