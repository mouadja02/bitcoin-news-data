2025-07-01T11:52:32,"Analysts say Bitcoin could hit new ATH $116k this July","After analyzing BTC’s historical pattern, Matrixport analysts predict that the largest cryptocurrency by market cap could reach as high as $116,000 in the next few weeks. In a recent report , Matrixport analysts state that the month of July has always “historically favored Bitcoin,” as patterns of strong gains for BTC ( BTC ) have been consistently shown every year during the same period. Due to this strong pattern, analysts predict that it may be able to reach a new all-time high at $116,000. “If historical seasonality holds, Bitcoin could be poised for another move higher — potentially reaching $116,000 in the coming weeks,” wrote the on-chain analysis firm. If BTC does manage to reach the $116k mark in July, it would give way for a new all-time high, beating out the previous $111,814 from May 22 this year. According to the shared chart showcasing Bitcoin performance in July, BTC once hit its highest July peak in 2020, rising by as much as 23.9%. The next two years that followed also held up strong gains. Analysts have concluded that the month of July has shown consistent gains, with an average return of more than 9.1%.

As of late, BTC has been on a slow descend after geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel heat up as well as the cautious stance on interest rates taken by the Fed . At press time, BTC has gone down by 0.9% in the past 24 hours. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap is currently trading hands at $106,678. Most recently, Matrixport highlighted a key difference between the recent BTC rally and previous ones. The analytics firm believes that this cycle is fueled by institutional investor demand, proven by the flurry of companies switching to adopt BTC as corporate reserve assets. This is largely in contrast with past rallies, which relied on retail investor moves to predict the market.

2025-07-01T11:51:59,"Is Robert Kiyosaki a Sucker for Buying More Bitcoin?","The author of Rich Dad Poor Dad became a Bitcoin bull several years ago and has since been highly vocal on social media about the asset’s qualities, advising people to invest in it. Following his own recommendation, Kiyosaki said he bought more bitcoin today. Is he a sucker for doing so? Kiyosaki Bought Again With prices of roughly $107,000 per BTC, Kiyosaki said he accumulated another bitcoin today, but warned that he could be wrong and played for a fool – something that has apparently happened to him before. The reason for his purchase today is that he believes BTC’s price will eventually skyrocket to $1 million , which has been the main narrative among perma-bitcoin bulls. “If I am a sucker…. I’d rather be a sucker than a LOSER if Bitcoin does go to $1 million. Nobody likes being suckers or losers…. Yet that is what makes life exciting.” His post was praised by bitcoin fans, but some cautioned that his actual reasoning could be the wrong one. David Leiter, whose X profile reads that he has been a stock investor with over 30 years of experience, noted that investing in anything due to FOMO (fear of missing out) is rarely a good decision and added : “It’s certainly not the way great investors pick investments.” Wish You Bought More Today’s BTC acquisition by Kiyosaki comes just a day after he made another highly bullish post regarding the primary cryptocurrency. As reported yesterday, he asked his millions of followers on X whether BTC was too expensive today. He then noted that he made his first bitcoin investment when the asset traded at $6,000, which was also considered too expensive at the time. Now, though, that price tag seems like a lifetime ago, and he believes the current levels of just over $100,000 will be considered a good buying opportunity in several years. As such, he added that people should allocate more into BTC because they will wish they bought more in the future.

2025-07-01T11:51:18,"Revolutionary AI Music Transcription: Songscription’s Brilliant ‘Shazam for Sheet Music’ Launch","BitcoinWorld Revolutionary AI Music Transcription: Songscription’s Brilliant ‘Shazam for Sheet Music’ Launch The world of decentralized finance and blockchain innovation often focuses on digital assets, but the underlying principles of efficiency and transformation are reshaping industries far beyond finance. Imagine a tool that could democratize music creation and learning, making it accessible to anyone, anywhere. This vision is now a reality with the launch of Songscription, a groundbreaking company leveraging advanced AI music transcription to convert audio into sheet music, a development poised to resonate deeply within the creative and tech communities alike. Unveiling Songscription: The Power of AI Music Transcription Last week marked a significant milestone for musicians and educators worldwide with the official launch of Songscription. This innovative small company has introduced advanced AI music transcription models designed to automate the often tedious process of converting audio recordings into readable sheet music. Within minutes, an audio file of a song can be transformed into a detailed musical score, offering a paradigm shift for how musicians interact with their compositions and learn new pieces. Operating on a freemium model, Songscription aims to serve a broad spectrum of users, from seasoned professional musicians to enthusiastic hobbyists, making sophisticated music technology accessible to all. How Songscription Elevates Your Musical Journey with Sheet Music AI Songscription’s core promise is to enhance the joy of playing music by removing common barriers. Andrew Carlins, CEO of Songscription and a student at Stanford’s MBA/MA in Education program, articulated this vision to Bitcoin World: “We hope to make playing music more enjoyable.” He envisions a future where tools like sheet music AI empower educators in remote areas, allowing a high school band teacher in rural Nebraska to effortlessly obtain sheet music for popular songs. More impressively, this future includes arrangements tailored specifically for the instruments available in a band, and even customized to the individual skill level of each student. This level of personalization, driven by artificial intelligence, was previously unimaginable for the average musician or school program. Beyond Transcription: Expanding the Reach of Music Technology At its inception, Songscription boasts the capability to transcribe music for various instruments, with its piano model currently demonstrating the highest reliability. However, the company’s roadmap extends far beyond current capabilities. Future enhancements include diversifying transcription outputs to include popular formats like guitar tabs, catering to a wider array of instrumentalists. Furthermore, Songscription aims to evolve from transcribing single instruments to arranging music for entire bands, providing comprehensive scores for ensemble performances. This evolution signifies a commitment to pushing the boundaries of music technology , ensuring the platform remains at the forefront of innovation in the music industry. For a musician in the midst of composing, the ability to record a melody and instantly receive its sheet music eliminates the time-consuming manual transcription process, allowing more focus on creative expression. Musician AI Tools and the Convenience Factor One of the most compelling aspects of Songscription is its ability to cater to musicians of all literacy levels in reading and writing sheet music. For those unfamiliar with traditional notation, the platform generates a ‘piano roll’ – a visual, digital representation of the music played on a virtual piano. This intuitive interface democratizes access to musical understanding. Additionally, Songscription simplifies the input process by allowing users to automate music transcription directly from YouTube links, adding a layer of convenience for accessing a vast library of online content. These practical musician AI tools are designed to streamline workflows and open new avenues for learning and creation. Navigating the Legal Landscape: The Nuances of AI Music Transcription The rapid advancement of AI in creative fields has inevitably led to discussions around copyright and intellectual property. Songscription requires users to confirm they possess the rights to transcribe uploaded files, though the ease of checking a box raises questions about unauthorized transcription of copyrighted material. Carlins addressed this nuanced area: “For music learners since you are allowed to listen to a song, write down the notes by ear, and perform it on your home piano (as long as you don’t charge for a performance), it isn’t fully clear that using a tech-enabled platform to give you a head start crosses any legal boundary, although we understand the field is evolving and our application may enter a grey area.” Recent court decisions have often favored tech companies in disputes involving creative AI tools, suggesting a shifting legal paradigm. It’s crucial to note that Songscription does not create new, AI-generated music; instead, it provides an augmented software solution to accelerate the transcription process for musicians. As Carlins states, “Since our platform allows users to edit the scores, we position ourselves as an augmented music notation software that helps people speed up the process of transcription.” This distinction is key in understanding its legal positioning within the realm of AI music transcription . The Engine Behind Songscription: Innovative AI and Data Acquisition The sophisticated capabilities of Songscription are built upon a robust technical foundation. The underlying architecture of the company’s AI model is rooted in research published by co-founder Tim Beyer, in collaboration with researcher Angela Dai. Developing such a powerful AI model required extensive training data. Songscription adopted a multi-faceted approach to data acquisition: Direct Collaboration: Partnering with musicians willing to share or sell their piano performances and corresponding sheet music. Public Domain: Utilizing publicly available sheet music, which forms a foundational dataset. Synthetic Data Generation: The majority of the training data is synthetic. This involves converting existing sheet music into audio, then intelligently altering these audio files to simulate real-world conditions, incorporating elements like background noise or reverb. This method allows for the creation of vast, diverse datasets crucial for training resilient and accurate AI models, further advancing the field of music technology . This innovative approach to data sourcing highlights the ingenuity required to bring advanced AI applications to market. Future Trajectory and Impact on Musicians and Beyond Just seven months after its inception, Songscription has already garnered significant attention and investment. The company successfully raised pre-seed funding from Reach Capital and has secured a coveted spot in Stanford’s StartX accelerator program, signaling strong confidence from investors and the academic community in its potential. The implications of Songscription’s technology extend beyond individual musicians. For music educators, it offers an unprecedented tool for creating tailored learning experiences. For composers, it provides an efficient bridge between improvisation and formal notation. For the broader creative industry, it represents another example of how AI is not replacing human creativity but augmenting it, providing powerful new musician AI tools that save time and foster innovation. The vision of democratizing access to music creation and learning, making it more enjoyable and accessible globally, is steadily becoming a reality through platforms like Songscription. Songscription stands as a testament to the transformative power of artificial intelligence in unexpected domains. By tackling the complex challenge of music transcription with cutting-edge AI, the company is poised to revolutionize how musicians compose, learn, and share their art. Its freemium model, coupled with a clear vision for future enhancements and a pragmatic approach to legal complexities, positions Songscription as a significant player in the evolving landscape of creative technology. As AI continues to integrate into various aspects of our lives, innovations like Songscription demonstrate its immense potential to enrich human experiences and unlock new levels of creativity for everyone, from the aspiring student to the seasoned professional.

2025-07-01T11:49:20,"MSTU Adds An Extra Layer Of Risk On Top Of A Leveraged Bitcoin Strategy","Summary MSTU offers 2X the daily performance of MSTR via options, introducing an additional layer of risk on top of a leveraged Bitcoin strategy. The ETF's performance is highly sensitive to volatility and Bitcoin price swings, amplifying both upside and downside moves. Holding MSTU beyond a single day can lead to substantial gains or losses due to compounding effects and value decay, especially in flat or choppy markets. Given these risks and long-term value decay, I recommend a sell rating for MSTU, suitable only for very short-term trading strategies. The T-Rex 2X Long MSTR Daily Target ETF ( MSTU ) is a leveraged, single-stock ETF designed to provide traders with 2X the daily performance of the underlying asset, Strategy ( MSTR ). For those seeking a 2X inverse strategy on MSTR shares, one can consider the T-Rex 2X Inverse MSTR Daily Target ETF ( MSTZ ). Unlike many leveraged funds, MSTU uses a series of options to create a leveraged position in MSTR. MSTU does not hold any of the underlying stock and only trades derivatives to achieve its 2X daily performance target. In order to achieve the appropriate exposure, MSTU trades both long-long and short-short positions, or is a buyer of call options and a seller of put options. Corporate Reports In Q1’25, MSTU used Clear Street Derivatives, Cantor Fitzgerald Secured, and Marex Prime Services as counterparties for options trading. As part of its trading strategy, MSTU has 256% exposure to long call positions and -228% exposure to short put positions. Because of the leveraged positions, MSTU has a daily performance reset, meaning that the ETF only provides 2X the performance on a daily basis. If held for a longer duration, investors may realize a compounding effect on both the upside and downside during a period of consecutive directional trading days. As a medium-term strategy, in this case, a strategy that is held beyond a single-day holding period, this could potentially result in substantial upside or downside risk, depending on the percentage change and volatility of MSTR shares. It should be noted that 2X the daily performance is only a target and may not be consistently achieved from day to day as many exogenous factors may impact the performance of the leveraged strategy, including volatility, or Vega, Delta, or the relative change of the option’s price to the underlying stock, and Theta, or the time decay of the option. TradingView Comparing MSTU to MSTR for a longer holding period, we can measure the slight compounding effect to the upside. TradingView The same is true for downside potential as returns can be amplified to consecutive days of losses on the underlying stock. TradingView In addition to this, there may be a certain degree of value decay that needs to be considered during extended holding periods, resulting in MSTU experiencing substantial losses relative to MSTR performance. TradingView Looking at the underlying assets, MSTR shares are relatively correlated with Bitcoin performance. Given Strategy’s shift in focus from enterprise software to acting as a leveraged Bitcoin strategy, MSTU is essentially a derivative of a derivative, adding a certain layer of risk that may result in substantial gains during periods of Bitcoin price appreciation, or losses during periods of declines in the price of Bitcoin. TradingView Despite the year-to-date performance of Bitcoin and MSTR shares, MSTU has suffered substantial losses as a result of the relative flatness of performance of the underlying assets. TradingView Bitcoin can be seen as a hedge against global currency risk, acting as a decentralized investment strategy that cannot be controlled by central banks. Nonetheless, Bitcoin has some correlation to the broader market, suggesting that the asset isn’t a complete hedge against markets. TradingView Risks Related to Leveraged Strategies There are inherent risks in investing in leveraged strategies. Because these strategies are meant to achieve their stated multiple over the underlying index on a daily basis, holding these strategies beyond a single day can lead to skewed performance, especially following consecutive days of upside or downside risk. This can lead to a compounding effect as well as value decay as a result of the daily reset in the derivatives positions. Leveraged strategies also add an extra layer of risk to amplified downside potential. For example, if the underlying index were to appreciate by 2% in a single day, a 3x strategy would appreciate by 6%, meaning that an investment of $100 would increase to $106. If the following day results in a -2% decline in the underlying index, or a -6% decline in the leveraged strategy, the investment will decline to $99.64. Holding leveraged strategies for longer than a single day can lead to a compounding effect on one’s position, potentially leading to significant skews from the intended multiplier. During multiple days of downside risk, an investor can experience significant value decay, potentially resulting in the inability to recover losses. Liquidity must be considered prior to investing in a leveraged fund strategy. Given that these funds are designed to be traded daily, trading volumes must be considered to ensure that cost-in/cost-out isn’t deteriorated by spreads. You can review additional risks here . Before making a trading or investment decision in leveraged strategies, be sure to fully understand your risk profile and set a trading mandate to manage these risks. I believe preemptively setting parameters for selling out of a position is prudent in ensuring that an investor appropriately manages downside risk. Conclusion Overall, MSTU can provide traders with a leveraged trading strategy to achieve 2X the daily performance of MSTR shares. Given the investment strategy of MSTU, investors must consider long-term value decay, compounding, and added volatility before considering entering into a position in MSTU for longer than a single day. Given the long-term value decay of the portfolio strategy, I am recommending MSTU with a sell rating.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4798557-mstu-adds-an-extra-layer-of-risk-on-top-of-a-leveraged-bitcoin-strategy?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY","MSTR|MSTZ|MSTU",cryptocompare

While American Express provided few technical details, the notice has reignited rumors of a deeper integration with Ripple, given the two firms’ history of working together on cross-border payment solutions. Crypto commentators, including Black Swan Capitalist’s Versan , have pointed to the timing of Amex’s modernization push and the company’s ongoing relationship with Ripple as possible hints of a deeper integration. American Express’ Biggest Card Overhaul Yet The speculation gained momentum as American Express unveiled its “largest investment ever in a Card refresh” this month. The overhaul includes updates to its US Consumer and Business Platinum Cards, aimed at enhancing rewards, spending flexibility, and services tailored to evolving customer needs. The announcement followed closely on the heels of Amex’s new partnership with Coinbase, which saw the launch of the Coinbase One Card offering up to 4% Bitcoin back on purchases along with exclusive American Express perks.

Although American Express has not directly confirmed any Ripple involvement, blockchain advocates argue that Amex’s prior collaboration with Ripple makes it a natural candidate to integrate RippleNet’s fast, low-cost cross-border settlement technology. “Payment infrastructure is being modernized, and American Express is a known Ripple partner,” Versan wrote.

American Express also a Ripple partner, what is cooking? #XRP #RLUSD #XRPETF pic.twitter.com/U4kIJpEWvE — Kenny Nguyen (@mrnguyen007) July 1, 2025 Amid the speculation, Ripple’s token has posted just a modest 1% gain over the past 24 hours, with XRP changing hands at $2.20 at the time of writing. Ripple and SEC Seek to Resolve Long-Standing Case Last week, Garlinghouse announced the company is dropping its cross-appeal against the SEC. “Ripple is dropping our cross-appeal, and the SEC is expected to drop their appeal, as they’ve previously said,” he said. The development came just a day after the US district court denied a joint request from Ripple and the SEC seeking an indicative ruling to reduce Ripple’s $125 million civil penalty and reverse the order labeling Ripple’s institutional XRP sales as securities transactions. Judge Analisa Torres wrote that Ripple’s willingness to “push the boundaries” of the prior summary judgment indicated a likelihood of further violations. Ripple’s chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty commented on the court’s decision, saying Ripple had two options: to drop its appeal or continue challenging the finding. Alderoty said that regardless of the path chosen, “XRP’s legal status as not a security remains unchanged,” claiming that Ripple’s operations would proceed normally.

Solana coin price could reach a potential high of $400 in 2025. With a potential surge, the SOL price could hit $1,351 by 2030. Solana is coming true to its community-claimed title, “Ethereum-Killer,” as it gradually surpasses Ethereum in the decentralized market. In a recent feat, Solana has signed an MoU with Kazakhstan to launch Central Asia’s first Solana Economic Zone. Talking about numbers, the Solana price currently trades at a discount of 49.45% from its ATH of $ 294.33. Following this, crypto investors are storming Google with questions like “Will Solana Go Back Up?” or “How high can Solana go?” and “Will SOL price reach $500 this altcoin season?” To answer more such questions, we bring to you our latest Solana price prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030.

The Bollinger Bands indicate a potential range, with the lower bound at $132, suggesting a potential low of $130.

Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July $130 $150 $165 Solana Price Prediction 2025 As per CoinGlass , Solana leads the crypto derivatives market with a massive $6.14 billion in open interest, far outpacing all other tokens. This indicates strong trader confidence and sustained capital inflow into SOL positions. Other notable projects like FARTCOIN, LINK, and UNI trail behind with open interest between $460M–$540M. The dominance of SOL on both the treemap and bar chart suggests it remains a favorite among leveraged traders, potentially fueling heightened volatility and price action in the near term. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250.

2025-07-01T11:45:08,"Here’s Why Bitcoin Is Not ‘Mooning’ Despite Demand From BTC Treasury Firms, According to Former Goldman Sachs Exec Michael Bucella","A former Goldman Sachs executive says that two key factors are driving selling pressure in the Bitcoin market, keeping BTC stuck in a sideways trend. In a new CNBC interview, Bucella, now managing partner at digital assets-focused investment firm Neoclassic Capital, says that despite the “huge demand” for the crypto king from companies seeking to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets and from the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the flagship digital asset is not “mooning” because there are investors who are offloading BTC and diversifying into crypto-related equities. “I think one, there’s been a bit of risk replacement. You have some of these major public companies becoming proxies for where crypto can go. And so there are people replacing Bitcoin spot risk with Circle or Coinbase or [BTC] treasury companies.” According to the Neoclassic Capital managing partner, Bitcoin miners are also contributing to Bitcoin’s sideways market. “The other part that’s a bit more technical, and I think maybe less discussed, is a lot of the Bitcoin miners who have been holding Bitcoin are operating in very narrow margin profiles now. And if you don’t have highly credible, high-top assets with great operating teams to pivot to, at least attempt to get an AI (artificial intelligence) contract or a hyperscaler contract, you have to sort of run these sometimes loss-operating models. And those are seeming to be financed by some Bitcoin sales or other capital markets activities.” Bitcoin is trading at $107,744 at time of writing, up by around 4% over the past month.

2025-07-01T11:37:14,"Germany's Deutsche Bank to debuts its crypto custody service in 2026","Deutsche Bank is finally getting ready to launch its own crypto custody service in 2026, with help from Bitpanda Technology Solutions, the tech division of the Austrian exchange. The reports came from Bloomberg, which claimed to have spoken to people with direct knowledge of the plan. The custody system is being developed by the bank’s corporate division, and it isn’t the first time they’ve talked about it. The original announcement about moving into crypto custody was made in 2022, but this is the first real progress being reported since then. The bank is also sticking with its existing tech partner, Taurus SA, a Swiss firm that provides tools for managing tokenized assets. Taurus has already been involved with Deutsche’s earlier blockchain projects and will continue to play a key role in this one. Both Bitpanda and Taurus are expected to deliver the backend that will let the bank offer full-scale institutional crypto custody by next year. Deutsche Bank expands into stablecoins and payment tokens Alongside the custody launch, Deutsche is now studying how it can get involved with stablecoins and tokenized deposits. It’s even considering issuing its own token, or possibly joining an industry-wide project focused on blockchain-based payments. The bank is also reportedly doing research on whether a tokenized deposit product could be built in-house, to be used for settling payments directly on chain. It wants to stay within regulatory guardrails, especially as rules around crypto in Europe become clearer under MiCA , and the US moves toward a more welcoming stance following Donald Trump’s return to the White House in November. Trump’s administration has appointed crypto-friendly figures to top financial roles and is pushing stablecoin legislation that makes it easier for traditional banks like Deutsche to get involved without legal risks. These moves have helped Bitcoin rebound sharply, pulling other digital assets with it. The new climate is one reason major financial firms are finally moving beyond exploration and into development. The partnership with Taurus isn’t just technical. In 2023, Deutsche was part of a $65 million investment round for the Geneva-based company, backing it alongside other major players. That funding was never just about equity; it also cemented a long-term relationship that’s now turning into a full-blown product rollout.

2025-07-01T11:30:00,"Metaplanet: Japan's Bitcoin Miracle Is Only Getting Started","Summary Metaplanet transformed from a struggling hotel operator into Asia’s top Bitcoin Treasury Company, amassing 13,350 BTC and soaring nearly 10,000% in share price since. The company’s innovative capital-raising (moving-strike warrants and zero-coupon bonds) lets it accumulate Bitcoin accretively while minimizing dilution and interest costs. Japan’s economic woes, including massive debt and a weakening yen, make Metaplanet’s Bitcoin-centric strategy an attractive hedge for investors fleeing fiat. Despite execution risks and heavy short interest, Metaplanet’s under-levered Bitcoin-rich balance sheet and accretive equity strategy form a highly compelling investment case. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is flirting with new all-time highs, all while Bitcoin Treasury Companies are sprouting left and right with a mission to accumulate as much of it as possible. If you aren't actively following the space, a vast movement is underway. MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) kicked it off, led by Bitcoin evangelist and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, who is steadily convincing more public companies to adopt a seemingly ridiculous (yet simple and potentially incredibly effective) strategy: abandon traditional practices, CAPEX plans, capital return programs, and M&A ambitions, and instead focus on accumulating Bitcoin. As much of it as possible, as fast as possible. The idea is simple: FIAT is worth less and less at an increasing pace, global debt is unsustainable, Bitcoin is the only way to escape a rotten system and preserve real wealth, so convert the ""worthless"" FIAT to buy the hardest money on Earth like your life depends on it. One of the first overseas firms to adopt this mantra was Metaplanet. The stock trades under the symbol 3350 in Japan, or ( OTC:MTPLF ) in OTC for U.S. investors. The Tokyo-based company abandoned its hospitality roots to evolve into Asia’s leading Bitcoin Treasury Company. In a nation choked by a 235% debt-to-GDP ratio and no yields, Metaplanet’s all-in Bitcoin strategy has sparked a frenzy among investors seeking (literally) alpha. From zero-interest bonds to a clever warrant program, here’s the story of how Metaplanet managed to grow its market cap from $10 million in early 2024 to $6.74 billion today while its shares rose by nearly 10,000% during this period. Metaplanet Share Price Return/Market Cap (Koyfin) From Quirky Hotels to Bitcoin Powerhouse Metaplanet began in 1999, managing budget hotels, including Japan’s niche “love hotels” for short-term stays. With just 17 employees and properties like the Royal Oak Hotel, this was a small fry on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Then here comes the pandemic, which severely impacted its business, leading to the closure of most properties and necessitating a rethink. Enter CEO Simon Gerovich, a former Goldman Sachs derivatives trader, who saw Bitcoin, not real estate, as the future. In 2024, Metaplanet sold off non-core assets and declared Bitcoin its primary treasury reserve, a move that stunned super-conservative Japan’s markets. Fast-forward to today, Metaplanet holds 13,350 BTC, worth $1.44 billion, which makes it the 5th-largest public company Bitcoin holder globally and Asia’s top corporate stacker. Clearly, it has all worked incredibly well for Metaplanet, and this makes sense given Japan’s economic struggles, which include a national debt of 1.28 quadrillion yen ($9.4 trillion) and a yen that has lost nearly one-third of its value since 2021. Fleeing from this sinking ship with Bitcoin’s fixed 21 million supply. Gerovich put it bluntly: “Bitcoin’s our escape from Japan’s economic quicksand.” Metaplanet's BTC Holdings (Metaplanet Analytics) The Bitcoin Strategy: Stacking Sats, Not Yen Metaplanet’s game plan revolves around “BTC Yield,” a metric pioneered by Mr. Saylor and Strategy, tracking Bitcoin per fully diluted share. For example, back in Q1, they reported a 95.6% BTC Yield, meaning shareholders got nearly double the Bitcoin exposure per share despite new equity issuance. Metaplanet's BTC Yield (Metaplanet Analytics) With the stock trading above NAV as investors try to price in the future BTC/share growth, the Bitcoin pile increases faster than the share count (i.e., fundraising is accretive). This accretion, in turn, leads to shares continuing to trade above NAV, a flywheel that seems quite sustainable as long as BTC doesn't plunge severely (and even then, equity is permanent capital with no liability, so it's not like Metaplanet would default). The company funds these purchases by issuing both moving strike warrants and convertible debt, a blended strategy that has proven very productive. As you can see in the chart, Metaplanet's BTC/share has steadily increased. In fact, it has accelerated in recent months. Metaplanet's BTC per Share (Metaplanet Analytics) Moving-Strike Warrants: A Dilution-Saving Masterstroke So what's the deal with Metaplanet’s moving-strike warrant program? It's a bit different from the at-the-market (ATM) equity offerings utilized by U.S.-based treasuries like MSTR. ATMs sell shares at current market prices, which may not be that attractive a strategy if demand for the stock is weak. If MSTR is selling off on any given day, it's unlikely that MSTR would opt to push the stock lower that very day by tapping into the ATM, for example. Metaplanet’s warrants are more dynamic. Essentially, the strike price adjusts daily to 100% of the previous day’s closing price and only triggers when the stock is rising. This lets Metaplanet raise capital at a ""premium"" valuation, with no pressure on the stock, all while aligning with market momentum. Here’s an example of how it works: if Metaplanet’s stock closes at 1,500 yen, the warrant’s strike price is set at 1,500 yen for the next day. If the stock climbs to 1,600 yen, warrant holders can exercise, buying shares at 1,500 yen, and Metaplanet raises cash at a high valuation. If the stock falls to 1,400 yen, warrants stay unexercised, protecting shareholders from low-price sales. To understand how effective this can be, for instance, in April, Metaplanet issued 21 million shares via warrants , raising 116 billion yen ($745 million) at 3,288 yen per share, which boosted BTC Yield by 42.82% with just 1.8% dilution. Zero-Interest Bonds: Betting on Metaplanet’s Balance Sheet Beyond issuing equity, Metaplanet has been issuing bonds. Impressively, they are zero-coupon bonds, which might seem a bit puzzling at first glance. Why would anyone lend at 0% interest? Well, many bondholders, like Evo Fund, also hold Metaplanet stock (e.g., 54 million shares via warrants). The bonds provide cheap capital for BTC buys, while bondholders’ equity stakes capture the upside. This symbiotic setup lets Metaplanet stack BTC without interest costs, while bondholders bank on stock gains and a robust balance sheet, a unique play in Japan’s starved-for-growth market. Debt-Free and Bitcoin-Rich: The Equity Surge Metaplanet's capital-raising strategy to acquire BTC has been so successful in the Japanese market that investors are literally lining up to give it funds. With shares trading at a steep m/NAV of about 4.7x, management took advantage of this enduring premium to quickly redeem its bonds, all while accretively selling additional stock. Along with last month's “555 Million Plan” announcement, the company raised $5.4 billion via 555 million shares, with $515 million on day one, retiring $281 million in 0% bonds, and at the same time boosting its BTC/share. As you can see, Metaplanet effectively became debt-free, all with a record BTC/share figure. Truly impressive financial engineering. Metaplanet's Outstanding Debt (Metaplanet Analytics) And just today, Metaplanet announced that it issued another 30 billion JPY in 0% ordinary bonds to purchase additional BTC, and I suspect they are going to repeat the very strategy of eventually leveraging the NAV premium to repay it prematurely as well. The Risk and The Reward Metaplanet’s risks are real and should not be ignored despite the company's utterly impressive ability to generate shareholder value. For example, while the previous zero-coupon bonds worked well and paid back with cheap equity, future liabilities might carry redemption risks if Bitcoin stalls. But other than that, there is no risk of issuing equity at a premium to NAV to buy BTC. Equity is permanent capital, and as long as the BTC per share goes up (all while all debt liabilities were paid, thus creating real value) and is therefore accretive, Metaplanet should keep doing so forever. Selling a dollar for $1.20 is always a good deal. Of course, this is a very profound investment case, and it makes sense that a great number of investors are betting against this sort of financial engineering BTC vehicle. After all, Metaplanet was the most-shorted stock in Japan in May, and I bet this was the case in June. However, the rate at which the company continues to grow its BTC/share, evident by its triple-digit BTC yield, could keep resulting in fantastic equity returns. You may argue that this in itself is dependent on the premium to the NAV holding. However, I don't see multiple compression as a potential risk today because, unlike the U.S market, with its Bitcoin ETFs, Japan lacks direct crypto investment options, making Metaplanet the sole Bitcoin proxy. So the 4.6x NAV premium (versus, say, Strategy’s 1.7x) reflects this scarcity. Conclusion Metaplanet’s leap from hotels to a Bitcoin Treasury Company has been an audacious yet rewarding journey. They have acquired 13,350 BTC by turning Japan’s yield desert into a money-raising oasis. In the meantime, the “555 Million Plan”, the 210,000 BTC goal by 2027, and their ongoing momentum position them as Asia’s Bitcoin leader. It’s going to be a volatile journey. Still, suppose you believe in Metaplanet's ability to keep leveraging a cash-rich, yield-starved Japan to form an engine that refines FIAT into the hardest asset out there while keeping pushing BTC/share higher (especially if you think in BTC's own future and appreciation potential). In that case, the NAV premium isn't that crazy for the underlying ""yield"". Metaplanet could be in the very early stage of its long-term BTC accumulation journey.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4798512-metaplanet-japans-bitcoin-miracle-is-only-getting-started?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|ASIA|MARKET|TRADING","MTPLF",cryptocompare
2025-07-01T11:29:36,"Is Bitcoin’s Price in Trouble? Here Are 3 Major Warning Signs","As bitcoin’s consolidation continues, certain on-chain metrics suggest that its stagnation could soon be over, but they offer a more bearish outlook for its future movements. Some of the most troubling factors come from the growing number of investors realizing profits and the dropping apparent demand. Warning Signs Appear The primary cryptocurrency has been stuck in a tight trading range at around $107,000 for over a week now, ever since it slipped below $100,000 during the darkest hours of the Israel-Iran war. Its breakout attempts have been stopped at $108,000 and $109,000, and market analysts are now exploring the possibility of another retracement. This could be due to several factors that are threatening the asset’s future price trajectory. First, Glassnode reported that BTC investors have started to take profits off the table in a significant manner, even though it’s still far from the peaks observed in late 2024. Profit-taking is ramping up on the #Bitcoin network again. Yesterday, $BTC realized profits hit $2.46B, while the 7D SMA climbed to $1.52B. That’s above the YTD average of $1.14B, but still well below the ~$4-5B peaks (7D SMA) seen in Nov–Dec 2024. pic.twitter.com/hGnQHyEI2c — glassnode (@glassnode) July 1, 2025 In addition, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez indicated that the apparent demand has weakened lately, as the metric has declined to -37,000 BTC. This is a clear sign that there’s a “sharp decline in buying interest.” Apparent demand for Bitcoin has dropped to -37,000 $BTC , signaling a sharp decline in buying interest! pic.twitter.com/MHAcr3jZGJ — Ali (@ali_charts) July 1, 2025 Lastly, Martinez brought up the overall capital going into the industry, which has seen a notable drop as well. The Bonus Aside from the aforementioned factors that could lead to a BTC price correction, CryptoPotato reported another worrying sign about the asset. The network activity has plunged in recent months, which means fewer people are interacting with it. In general, such occasions are linked to price declines. However, BTC has managed to defy the odds lately as it recovered from its sub-$75,000 drop, even though the metric remained low. Additionally, reports claim that the asset’s price surge to new all-time highs and its ability to remain above $100,000 is due to larger investors taking bigger shares of the market.

The move reflects growing institutional interest, with rival group Volksbanken also entering the space. While the Sparkassen Finance Group aims to provide secure, regulated access, it warns customers that crypto remains highly speculative, volatile, and prone to risks like fraud and hacking. July 1, 2025 11:53:31 UTC Elon Musk Sounds the Alarm on U.S. Debt If President Donald Trump truly wants to achieve his economic goals, like lower inflation, reduced rates, and trade balance, a simple solution exists: eliminate the U.S. deficit. Cutting deficit spending would ease Treasury issuance, lowering yields, calming the bond market, and giving the Fed room to cut rates. Ironically, that would even strengthen Trump’s tariff game. As Elon Musk keeps warning about the growing U.S. debt, more people are starting to pay attention. The real solution for the future is clear: spend responsibly. If things don’t change, many believe the country could face bankruptcy—it’s not just a risk, it’s where we’re headed.

Bloomberg has increased the chances of a spot XRP ETF approval to a whopping 95%. Once dismissed as a regulatory target, XRP is now seen as a serious player in institutional finance.

It was the prologue.” July 1, 2025 11:41:46 UTC Brad Garlinghouse Gets XRP Tattoo Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse showed his strong support for XRP by sharing a photo of a new XRP logo tattoo on his forearm. The post went viral after crypto influencer Digital Asset Investor shared it, noting that a Harvard MBA holder over 50 getting a tattoo is a serious sign of long-term belief—not just a random act. Garlinghouse simply replied with, “1,000%.” July 1, 2025 11:41:46 UTC Bitcoin Price Today On July 1, 2025, Bitcoin is trading at $106,537, showing slight weakness after a failed breakout above $108,800. Intraday range remains narrow, with support at $106,000 and resistance near $108,000. Technical indicators suggest mixed momentum, while longer-term moving averages remain bullish. Traders expect increased volatility this July, especially if BTC breaks below $106K or climbs past $108K. Market sentiment is cautious, with short-term bearish bias. July 1, 2025 11:06:43 UTC Why Crypto Market is Down Today? The crypto market is down today mainly due to heavy selling by miners, ongoing high interest rates from the US Federal Reserve, and negative sentiment sparked by the public feud between Elon Musk and Donald Trump. Additional factors include large whale sell-offs, leveraged liquidations, and cautious investor sentiment, leading to widespread declines across top cryptocurrencies. July 1, 2025 11:06:43 UTC DOGE Pushes for Softer SEC Rules Amid Trump Order DOGE is reportedly urging the SEC to ease regulations on SPACs and private fund reporting, aiming to lower compliance costs and streamline public listings. The move follows Trump’s February executive order directing DOGE to identify and eliminate costly federal regulations. Critics warn the changes could reduce transparency and increase risk, raising concerns about political interference in financial oversight. July 1, 2025 11:06:43 UTC Did the Big Beautiful Bill Pass the Senate? No — as of July 1, 2025, the Senate has not passed the “Big Beautiful Bill.” Republicans remain locked in a marathon “vote‑a‑rama” on amendments, working feverishly to secure a majority. GOP unity is fractured between moderates and conservatives, and key provisions—like state-level AI regulation bans—have already been stripped out.

2025-07-01T11:17:54,"Software Engineer Says XRP Is Destined to Hit $30 or $50, Shares Opinion On Timeline","Software engineer Vincent Van Code recently addressed a topic that he rarely comments on publicly: the price prediction for XRP. In his statement on X, he explained that while he typically avoids making price forecasts, the consistent demand for his opinion led him to share it openly. He stated that he believes XRP could reach a price between $30 and $50. He emphasized that this was purely his personal opinion and not an attempt to convince anyone. Van Code clarified that he does not claim to be a prophet or possess any special foresight, but that this range forms the basis of his personal investment thesis in XRP. He further admitted that the precise timeline for reaching this valuation remains uncertain. However, he considered the timing to be a secondary concern compared to the conviction he holds regarding the asset’s potential value. In his words, the uncertainty of “when” is simply a minor point in the broader context of his investment outlook. Van Code also encouraged others in the community to share their price opinions without fear of criticism. He expressed that having an opinion about the price of an asset should not be a source of embarrassment, regardless of whether others agree or disagree. His statement conveyed that investors often find reassurance in knowing that others share similar expectations or convictions regarding the future of their holdings. I usually don't predict XRP price but often get asked, so here it is FINALLY… Of course, like many, I hold XRP in hopes of price going up, so it would make sense to have an opinion.

An X user named TXFBrecruiting expressed a higher valuation outlook than Van Code, stating that a price range of $50 to $100 for XRP seems obvious. He argued that the potential for XRP to capture 14% of the SWIFT financial messaging system, as mentioned by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse , could push the price within this range. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 TXFBrecruiting also suggested that further upside could be driven by factors such as the introduction of XRP-related ETFs , corporate reserves adopting XRP, and possible integrations with the DTCC (Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation), including participation in the global derivatives market. Another user, CryptoMaxi, offered a more reserved prediction. He revealed that he recently had a dream in which XRP reached $47, noting it was his first XRP-related dream in seven years. Despite this symbolic moment, he maintained that his actual price thesis places XRP’s potential high at around $21. Nathan Pennock contributed a significantly more optimistic view, stating his belief that XRP could reach $1,000 . He clarified that he does not know when this would occur, but suggested that Bitcoin’s dominance is declining. According to Pennock, as Bitcoin’s market presence diminishes, capital will flow into XRP, allowing it to regain what he describes as its rightful position in the digital asset landscape. He concluded by suggesting that when this happens, XRP’s price ceiling could become effectively limitless. Vincent Van Code’s tweet and the subsequent responses reflect a wide range of opinions regarding the potential future price of XRP. While Van Code’s prediction of $30 to $50 is grounded in his own investment rationale without asserting certainty, the broader XRP community displayed varying levels of optimism.

2025-07-01T11:15:34,"Liberland to hold next National Blockchain Election on July 3","Liberland, the self-declared micronation situated on disputed land between Croatia and Serbia, is preparing to hold its latest national election entirely on the blockchain. The vote is scheduled for Thursday, July 3, 2025, at 14:22 Central European Time. The 7-square-kilometer nation was founded in 2015 by its President, Czech politician Vít Jedlička. Per the country’s website, Liberland is a government based on libertarian principles, voluntary association, and blockchain technology. Citing the homestead principle and the Montevideo Convention of 1933, Vít Jedlička declared the land his own after planting a flag with his girlfriend and a friend. The politician had said he was not interested in holding office and recused himself from voting. Still, he was elected Liberland’s first president by a 2–0 vote, according to the New York Times . Liberland’s blockchain election system continues Liberland’s government uses a decentralized online platform where its citizens participate in national decisions, including elections, through blockchain-based platforms. It was the first country to adopt Bitcoin (BTC) as its official currency before El Salvador , per records from the state. According to the nation’s laws, elections are held every 90 days. There have been two elections held in 2025, in January and April, with the next round concluding on July 3. As of July 1, just two days and a few hours remain before voting closes. During each cycle, eligible citizens cast their votes for congressional candidates by staking their digital holdings on the Liberland blockchain. Liberland law prohibits citizens receiving welfare benefits from taking part in the electoral process. The voting system enables voters to select multiple candidates, and an algorithm allocates voting power accordingly. If some candidates have sufficient support, voting weight is directed toward those who need additional votes to cross the election threshold. Votes are cast through the Liberland Blockchain Portal, where citizens can choose their preferred candidates listed on the platform. To vote or participate in governance, citizens must first register through the blockchain portal. According to Liberland’s website FAQs, congress is mandated to legislate and manage the national budget, though these responsibilities are currently shared with a provisional government. All laws passed by Congress must be confirmed through a public referendum. Meanwhile, budget decisions must pass through the Senate, which holds veto power over national expenditures. These bylaws create a model of direct and representative democracy enabled by the blockchain, purportedly similar to the system used in Polkadot’s OpenGov. Candidates and congressional roles This election cycle has several candidates from different industries, nationalities, and ideological backgrounds. The current Congress includes names seeking re-election. All candidates will hold a live debate session on Tuesday, at around 17:00 CET. One name the community is well familiar with is Justin Sun , the founder of the TRON blockchain network. Sun, an entrepreneur in the crypto business, a President Donald Trump ally, and a former Permanent Representative of Grenada to the World Trade Organization, was elected Liberland’s Prime Minister in October 2024. According to a Liberland press statement published in January, President Vít Jedlička nominated Speaker Sun to keep his position as PM. “ For those skeptical of the idea that reduced government expenditure could lead to social unrest, I point to Liberland as a living example of how this philosophy works in practice, our citizens live freely and thrive under this system ,” Sun said in an interview last year, when he added the title “His Excellency” to all his social media tags. Evan Luthra, another KOL in Web3 and startup ecosystems, also serves in Congress. The 24-year-old businessman and angel investor has backed over 300 technology ventures globally. Another congressional member is Dr. Tariq Abbasi, a recipient of the MBE and Deputy Lieutenant of Greater London. Dr. Abbasi has reportedly helped Liberland secure international meetings and represent the nation’s interests overseas. Other candidates include Michal Ptáčník, a constitutional lawyer who helped draft Liberland’s foundational legal documents, and Navid Saberin, a polyglot technologist in commerce, real estate, and software. Lastly, Dorian Štern Vukotić, one of the architects behind Liberland’s blockchain, is running for a third term at the policymaking seat. Vukotić has promised to reduce bureaucratic disorganization and increase Liberland’s government operations through reforms. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-07-01T11:00:17,"Bank Of Korea Halts CBDC Project As Lawmakers Focus On Stablecoin Regulation","The Bank of Korea (BOK) has reportedly halted its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) project following the South Korean government’s focus on stablecoins. The shift has left project participants with “no long-term roadmap” and banks pivoting to this sector. BOK Suspends Second Phase Of CBDC Testing On Sunday, local news outlet Yonhap News Agency reported that the Bank of Korea had notified banks participating in the Han River Project that the second phase of CBDC testing would be suspended. The BOK and seven banks began the first phase of testing in April, targeting 100,000 financial consumers and planning to complete it by June 30. Originally, the project was scheduled to start its second phase at the end of the year, testing peer-to-peer transfers, expanding payment merchant locations, and simplifying authentication methods. However, banks reportedly raised concerns about the “excessive cost burden without concrete plans for commercialization,” leading to the project’s pause. Notably, the banking sector is bearing the cost of the project and recently demanded that the Bank of Korea provide a clear long-term roadmap with plans for commercialization. Banks requested the BOK to “establish a ‘CBDC General User Real-Transaction Test Task Force’ involving all relevant departments of the Bank of Korea and banks to develop a long-term roadmap including post-test commercialization plans, and then realistically adjust the project schedule based on this roadmap.” As a result, the BOK has concluded that it must clarify its internal stance and schedule regarding digital assets, as stablecoin momentum grows and discussions in the National Assembly and the private sector intensify. According to a senior official at a commercial bank, the Bank of Korea explained that it would “wait and see how the situation develops, given that the legalization of stablecoins is currently underway, while it is unclear how CBDC, stablecoins, and deposit tokens differ and can coexist.” Similarly, another senior official affirmed that the atmosphere is shifting toward stablecoins, detailing that “Until the dinner meeting between Bank of Korea Governor Lee Chang-yong and bank presidents on the 23rd, the atmosphere was not like this, but the situation has changed significantly since then.” Nonetheless, the Han River Project could be reconsidered in 2026, according to another bank official, who claimed that the Bank of Korea mentioned the possibility of revisiting CBDC testing and “pushing forward with it around the first half of next year.” Banks Prepare For Stablecoin Legislation Following this development, banks participating in the CBDC project are expected to shift to stablecoin issuance as related legislation gains support, preparing for issuance with other banks or non-bank entities. At the start of the month, a member of South Korea’s ruling party, Min Byeong-deok, introduced a comprehensive bill to establish a more structured regulatory framework for crypto assets in the country. As reported by Bitcoinist, the Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) lawmaker proposed the Digital Assets Basic Act to complement the Virtual Asset Investor Protection Act and offer a broader legal foundation for the industry. Additionally, it focuses on implementing a licensing system for stablecoin issuers and clear rules. The banking sector is considering a business model in which banks establish a joint venture to collectively issue stablecoins, while contacting various non-bank companies to prepare for the legalization and issuance of stablecoins. A bank official affirmed that “It is unclear whether banks or big tech (large IT companies) and fintech (financial technology companies) will be the issuers of stablecoins,” adding that they “have no choice but to prepare for both scenarios before legalization.” Another bank official stated that it is necessary to collaborate with fintech companies for scalability, explaining that banks are “not only discussing stablecoins with the Bank of Korea and other banks, but also meeting regularly with ‘payment’ companies, cryptocurrency exchanges, and blockchain companies to prepare for the issuance of stablecoins.”",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bank-of-korea-halts-cbdc-project-as-lawmakers-focus-on-stablecoin-regulation/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Crypto News|Bank of Korea|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|CBDC|crypto regulation|Soth korea CBDC|South Korea Crypto Policy|south korea regulation|South korea stablecoins|Stablecoin regulation|Stablecoins",cryptocompare

2025-07-01T10:50:58,"No Bitcoin for Connecticut: State Bans Investment and Reserves in New Law","The post No Bitcoin for Connecticut: State Bans Investment and Reserves in New Law appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont has signed House Bill 7082 into law, officially regulating the “ Bitcoin Reserve Ban” in the state. Now, Connecticut is prohibited from accepting, holding, or investing in digital assets. This marks a contrast from the US trend in the evolution of virtual digital currency. Connecticut Officially Bans Bitcoin Reserve The legislation titled “An Act Concerning the Prohibition of State Government Entities from Holding or Investing in Cryptocurrencies ” was initially introduced in response to growing concerns regarding volatilities and uncertainties in digital currencies in February 2025 before finalizing the enactment on June 30. The enactment provides clarity that the state prioritizes risk mitigation and consumer protection over speculative investment. Legislation on the Prohibition of Cryptocurrency Settling the long-standing debate, Connecticut finalizes the ban on cryptocurrency and other virtual currencies to prevent the state from associated risks. The law ensures that Connecticut remains protected from the threats associated with the digital assets market. “Neither the state nor any political subdivision of the state shall (1) accept or require payment in the form of virtual currency for an amount due to the state or the political subdivision, or (2) purchase, hold, invest in or establish a reserve of virtual currency,” HB 7082 reads . [post_titles_links postid=”477237″] Key Highlights of Crypto Ban Legislation It introduces comprehensive consumer protection measures, ensuring that businesses engaging in virtual asset transactions disclose potential risks. Provisions aimed at enhancing transparency and security in virtual currency transactions. Crypto businesses must disclose critical risks– irreversibility of transactions, absence of government insurance, and potential for unrecoverable losses. Introduced new daily transaction limits for virtual currency kiosk – $2,000 for new customers and $5,000 for existing ones. Virtual currency kiosk operators face stricter regulations– provide live customer support and employ a full-time compliance officer to oversee adherence. The enactment sets Connecticut apart from other US states like Texas , Arizona , and New Hampshire , which continue to adopt digital currency reserves. As the bill contrasts with the majority of US states, it has been met with mixed reactions from industry experts and policymakers. Some argue that the bill is crucial for precautions, while others say it stifles innovation in the nation. [article_inside_subscriber_shortcode title=”Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!” description=”Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more.” category_name=”News” category_id=”6″] FAQs How does Connecticut’s crypto ban compare to other states’ approaches to digital assets? Connecticut’s ban on state entities holding or investing in crypto contrasts sharply with states like Texas, Arizona, and New Hampshire, which are moving to establish digital asset reserves. This highlights a growing divergence in state-level approaches, with Connecticut prioritizing risk aversion while others embrace crypto innovation. What are the potential impacts of Connecticut’s crypto ban on its digital economy and blockchain innovation? While the ban aims to protect public funds from volatility, critics argue it could stifle innovation within Connecticut’s digital economy. It might deter blockchain-based startups and investment, potentially causing them to gravitate towards more crypto-friendly states that encourage digital asset development and integration. How might Connecticut’s legislation influence other states’ cryptocurrency policies? Connecticut’s cautious approach could influence other risk-averse legislatures to consider similar bans or stricter regulations on state crypto involvement. It adds to the ongoing national debate about crypto’s role in public finance, potentially encouraging a more conservative stance in states prioritizing financial stability over speculative gains.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/no-bitcoin-for-connecticut-state-bans-investment-and-reserves-in-new-law/,"REGULATION|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|ALTCOIN","News|Bitcoin Reserve",cryptocompare

The token is more widely used in liquidity pairs, supporting 25% of the available 1% liquidity depth. The fully regulated stablecoin by Circle is becoming more important for the BTC market. The stablecoin is displacing fiat pairs in terms of activity, while securing a growing part of the 1% market depth. Circle has gained market share in 2025 For the first half of 2025, the share of USDC in securing BTC liquidity rose from around 15% to 24%. The share of USDT remained flat for the first half of the year. Liquidity for USDC-denominated trading pairs is steadily climbing across crypto markets. BTC-USDC now accounts for 24% of total 1% market depth on major exchanges, up from 15% six months ago. 📈 🌊📈 pic.twitter.com/yI9bOf5nXo — Kaiko (@KaikoData) July 1, 2025 The influence of USDC expanded, as the total supply returned to levels from 2023, erasing the effect of the bear market and lowered demand. The stablecoin currently carries around 10.5% of all BTC trading volume, though the activity metric diverges from the available depth. Volumes for USD pairs account for over 19% of BTC daily volumes, mostly due to Coinbase’s influence. Trading volumes are also open to brief anomalies or days of record trading, as in the case of USD1 , which briefly surpassed Circle USD in 24-hour trading. USDC expands its influence with growing supply The share of USDT has fallen to around 37% of all volumes, down from its usual levels above 50%. Currently, FDUSD is also highly active, with a 300% daily turnover of its entire supply. FDUSD , however, remains limited to Binance trading pairs. USDC is currently expanding its presence and activity levels, rising to a higher baseline in 2025. USDC achieves $5B to $7B in daily trading, with varying activity in both centralized and decentralized pairs. Currently, USDC is also highly active for swaps against USDT, reflecting demand for fully regulated tokens, the only type that can be used in some regions. The usage of USDT also coincided with the expansion of EURC , the Euro-linked stablecoin minted by Circle. USDC is also spreading to a wider selection of holders. In 2025, almost every month has seen an expansion of wallets holding Circle dollar stablecoin. Most of the Circle-issued USD is held in personal end-user wallets , with around 54K smart contracts supplied with the token. USDC expanded its holders in 2025, with more demand for a regulated stablecoin. | Source: Dune Analytics One of the sources of USDC growth is its usage on Hyperliquid . Nearly 3B Circle USD were deposited on the perpetual futures DEX, becoming a key stablecoin for mostly BTC and ETH pairs. The other source of app activity comes from Polymarket, where USDC supports an active prediction market as the main source of liquidity. The token is also showing expansion of its on-chain activity, mostly on the Ethereum chain. The stablecoin is the fourth most active smart contract on Ethereum in early July, burning up 65 ETH in daily fees. The stablecoin is slowly catching up to Tether, with 100 ETH in daily burned fees. USDC is also expanding on Solana, minting another 250M tokens in the past 24 hours. The supply on Solana peaked above 12B tokens, then shrank again at around 10.5B . Solana activity is expected to pick up ahead of its new ETF launch, boosting demand for stablecoin liquidity.

This is one of the very few indicators in bitcoin that has only risen over time. The 200WMA has historically provided significant support levels. During the 2015 bear market, it offered support around $200. During the 2018 bear market, it held above $3,000. In the covid-19 induced crash of March 2020, the price briefly dipped below the 200WMA to around $5,300, although it eventually fell as low as $3,000. However, bitcoin experienced a prolonged bear market from June 2022 to October 2023, during which the price remained below the 200WMA, which was approximately $25,000 for those 15 months. Meanwhile, the 200-Day simple moving average (200DMA), a widely used technical indicator to gauge transitions between bull and bear markets, currently sits at $96,246, indicating that bitcoin is in a bull market. The price dipped below the 200DMA between February and April but remained above it during the recent correction to $98,000 amid the Iran and US conflict .

The move comes as the Gulf city continues to lure digital asset firms with its relaxed tax policies and business-friendly environment. The Miami-based company registered the new office last week with the Dubai International Financial Centre, one of the region’s key financial zones. Bloomberg confirmed that the firm is actively building a team in the emirate, focused on digital asset trading and treasury management. Dubai Office Part of Broader Global Pivot CEO Asher Genoot said the new base would help “enhance the precision and efficiency of Hut 8’s capital strategy.” A Trump family-linked Bitcoin miner plans to set up an office in Dubai, a growing hub for the crypto industry known for its friendly approach to taxation and regulation. https://t.co/eIkKLP8yPu — Bloomberg (@business) June 30, 2025 The decision to expand into Dubai reflects a broader recalibration within the crypto industry, as firms seek regulatory certainty and access to global liquidity. Hut 8 didn’t return Cryptonews’ request for comment by press time. Dubai has emerged as a magnet for digital asset players by offering zero corporate taxes in its free zones and a light-touch regulatory regime. Its status as a financial and logistics hub has also made it an attractive destination for miners and crypto-native firms looking to operate across jurisdictions. Hut 8 Eyes Liquidity Abroad Amid Shifting Crypto Regulation Hut 8 already runs Bitcoin mining operations in Texas, New York and Alberta Canada. As of the end of 2024, the company had around 220 employees. While it remains a dominant miner in North America, the new outpost in the Middle East suggests a growing appetite to tap into global capital flows and optimize treasury strategies amid Bitcoin’s renewed bull run. The company’s name has recently drawn attention due to its involvement with American Bitcoin Corp. , a new venture backed in part by Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump. That entity is set to go public later this year and will absorb most of Hut 8’s mining operations. Hut 8 will retain an 80% stake and leadership roles in the merged company, while the Trump-affiliated American Data Centers holds the remaining 20%. Despite these ties, the Dubai office is reportedly not connected to the American Bitcoin venture. Instead, it marks a standalone initiative by Hut 8 to strengthen its presence in one of the world’s fastest-growing crypto hubs. As digital asset regulation tightens in the US and parts of Europe, Dubai’s more accommodating stance is becoming a key draw.

2025-07-01T10:14:40,"American Bitcoin Raises $220 Million to Expand Mining Operations and Treasury","American Bitcoin, a majority-owned subsidiary of crypto mining giant Hut 8, has successfully raised $220 million in a private placement aimed at expanding its Bitcoin mining capabilities and bolstering its Bitcoin treasury. The company issued 11 million shares on Friday, generating gross proceeds of $220 million, according to a recent regulatory filing. Interestingly, $10 million worth of these shares were purchased using Bitcoin rather than cash, with the average cost of acquisition noted at $104,000 per coin. As of June 10, American Bitcoin held a treasury of 215 Bitcoin, reflecting its strategy of strengthening its on-balance-sheet crypto holdings alongside its mining operations. The firm has notable connections with the Trump family, as former President Donald Trump’s sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, were among the co-founders of American Bitcoin. Hut 8, which acquired a majority stake in the firm on March 31, continues to drive the company’s strategic direction as it prepares for further growth. Hut 8 Expands to Dubai Amid Crypto Market Push In a parallel move, Hut 8 is expanding its footprint to Dubai, launching a new office registered under Hut 8 Investment Ltd. on June 23, according to a Bloomberg report. The expansion aims to enhance Hut 8’s crypto trading capabilities and digital asset accumulation strategy, leveraging the UAE’s favorable crypto regulations and tax structure. Asher Genoot, CEO of Hut 8, stated that the Dubai office will “enhance the precision and efficiency of Hut 8’s capital strategy ,” allowing the firm to execute trades and manage capital with greater flexibility. However, a spokesperson clarified to Bloomberg that this new Dubai office operates independently of American Bitcoin and does not have operational ties with the subsidiary. The UAE has emerged as a hub for crypto startups in recent years, but companies are still required to maintain robust legal compliance frameworks to navigate evolving local regulations while operating within the jurisdiction. Path Toward Public Listing via Nasdaq Merger In May, it was announced that American Bitcoin would become a publicly traded company by merging with Gryphon Digital Mining, a crypto-mining firm listed on the Nasdaq . The merger, structured as a stock swap, will see the newly combined entity operate under the American Bitcoin brand. Eric Trump is set to join the board following the merger, while existing shareholders of American Bitcoin will retain 98% ownership of the combined company. Hut 8 will continue to oversee operational activities, further positioning American Bitcoin to scale its presence in the mining and crypto treasury sectors as it transitions to public markets.

Price prediction for 2025 suggests a potential high of $32. Long-term forecasts indicate LINK could reach $195 by 2030. Chainlink has emerged as a game-changing decentralized oracle network, enabling smart contracts to connect seamlessly with real-world data, APIs, and traditional financial systems. As the crypto market evolves, Chainlink’s role continues to expand—especially with its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) gaining traction. Its native token, LINK, not only powers the ecosystem but has also caught the attention of investors and analysts. With LINK price showing signs of a potential breakout and strong on-chain fundamentals backing its rise, the big question remains: Can LINK coin price hit $50 in 2025? Let’s dive into this detailed Chainlink price prediction 2025–2030 to find out.

The end of June showed bullish reawakening in the short term as LINK price seeks a retest of the $18 neckline. This retest is essential for sustaining its upward momentum. The price is currently trying to stabilize around the $13 mark, and a successful break above the $18 level could signal a bullish trend. But if $13 breaks, then it might pull back to $10. LINK Price Prediction 2025 In 2025, Chainlink (LINK) started the year on a downward path, but by April, the tide began to turn. Early in the month, LINK began its recovery from a low of $10.067. By May, it had formed a bullish rounded bottom pattern, with a crucial neckline set at $18. However, since mid-May, LINK has faced challenges in maintaining its position near this neckline. By the third week of June, it pulled back toward the support level of the rounded bottom, which coincides with a multi-year support zone around $11. In the final week of June, LINK’s price began to rise again, attempting to hold steady near the key $13 mark. If bullish momentum continues, LINK could aim to retest the neckline at $18 in July. For this price advance to sustain itself in the long term, LINK must break above and close daily above the $18 neckline. Such a move could signal a potential upward trend, increasing the chances of retesting the $24 resistance level in Q3 and Q4. This area is supported by a high-volume profile from earlier in the year. If LINK manages to surpass the $24 mark, projections for late 2025 suggest that the token could soar as high as $32.

2025-07-01T10:07:51,"Is the US about to pass the most industry-friendly crypto law yet?","Before the elections, the cryptocurrency industry was characterized by scrutiny, strict policies, and lawsuits. But things are changing rapidly. This month, the Senate passed the GENIUS Act , a bill designed to regulate stablecoins and bring digital assets under federal oversight. This is the first time either chamber has approved major crypto legislation. And with the House now preparing a joint vote on two bills, the United States may soon have its clearest crypto framework yet. What does the GENIUS Act actually do? The GENIUS Act sets out to regulate stablecoins, which are digital tokens pegged to traditional currencies like the US dollar. These coins are meant to offer price stability and are often used for transactions within crypto platforms or across borders. Read also: A financial revolution: how stablecoins are revamping the global payments industry The bill mandates that issuers maintain fully backed reserves, give investors priority in bankruptcy, and comply with anti-money laundering and terrorism financing rules. A new regulatory board will oversee approvals of new stablecoin issuers. Supporters say it’s about modernizing payments and reinforcing the dollar’s dominance in a digital age. Senator Bill Hagerty, the bill’s sponsor, argued that the US must act or risk losing ground in financial innovation. His thesis is that since Americans are already using stablecoins, Washington should support, not oppose. What does the public really want from crypto regulation? According to CoinCover’s latest Trust Factor Report , the appetite for stronger guardrails is clear. In a survey of over 1,000 individuals across multiple regions, 82% said they believe the crypto industry needs a global regulatory framework. 67% said they’d be more likely to invest, or invest even more, if crypto were regulated like traditional assets such as stocks and bonds. Source: CoinCover The takeaway is simple: users aren’t rejecting oversight. They’re asking for it. Almost half of the respondents had either experienced or witnessed irreversible losses due to scams, fraud, or lost access to wallets. That explains why nearly 80% supported compensation schemes for victims of hacks or technical failures. The message is not that regulation threatens innovation. The opposite is true. It’s that meaningful oversight is a prerequisite for trust, adoption, and scale. Do experts agree on what kind of regulation is needed? The Trust Factor Report doesn’t just reflect retail sentiment. It also draws from interviews with some of the industry’s most active operators and legal experts. And while their perspectives vary, most agree on one thing: traditional financial rules don’t work for crypto. Unlike banks or broker-dealers, crypto companies are often vertically integrated. They operate exchanges, custody wallets, and staking services, all under one roof. Applying legacy frameworks built for siloed institutions only increases friction. Instead, experts call for tailored regulation that reflects the technology’s structure. Regulation should match how value moves, how custody is handled, and how risk is distributed, not just how a service looks on paper. They also stress the importance of stablecoin clarity. When reserve rules and issuer obligations are clear, capital can flow more freely. That means more involvement from hedge funds, family offices, and even traditional banks. Consumer protection is another top priority. The failures of FTX, Celsius, and Terra have shown that transparency around reserves and internal controls isn’t optional. It’s essential. There’s also broad consensus that global alignment is coming, even if full harmonization isn’t realistic. Core principles like anti-money laundering, cybersecurity, and market integrity are expected to converge, especially among Western regulators. Finally, privacy and decentralization are key topics of discussion. But the dominant view is that regulators should focus on access points like exchanges and wallet providers without trying to police decentralized protocols themselves. The goal is to protect users, not force the industry back into centralized models. Why the US and Europe are moving in different directions The GENIUS Act is part of a wider effort that sets the US apart from other jurisdictions. Under the Trump administration, the US is leaning into permissive, business-friendly policies, especially when it comes to stablecoins . Source: Bloomberg That stands in contrast to the European Union’s MiCA framework, which is broader in scope and significantly more restrictive. MiCA introduces high compliance requirements, strict license terms, and clear boundaries around stablecoins, NFTs, and DeFi. Some see MiCA as a benchmark for institutional trust. Others view it as a barrier that could push innovation elsewhere. In the UK and UAE, hybrid approaches are emerging. These jurisdictions are trying to balance sandbox-style flexibility with long-term clarity, hoping to position themselves as innovation hubs without sacrificing security or investor protection. The divergence is especially important as capital, talent, and startups will gravitate toward the jurisdictions that offer both regulatory clarity and room to grow. What happens next? The House is expected to vote on the GENIUS Act in early July , possibly bundling it with the Clarity Act, which addresses crypto market structure more broadly. That strategy could accelerate both bills or stall them, depending on political dynamics. Trump has been publicly pushing for speed. But internal divisions and concerns over bundling may cause delays, especially as the Clarity Act faces scrutiny in the Senate’s Banking and Agriculture Committees. If passed, the GENIUS Act will immediately bring stablecoins under federal oversight. That would likely trigger a wave of compliance efforts among US-based issuers and could prompt institutional players to enter the market. Looking further ahead, we can expect more state-level frameworks to emerge, especially as regulators attempt to address gaps left by federal legislation. Meanwhile, other countries will be waiting to see if the US gains a competitive advantage by moving first on stablecoin regulation.

2025-07-01T10:03:08,"Historic Ethereum (ETH) Decision Comes from Bitcoin Mining Company! Wall Street Giant Tom Lee Speaks Assertively!","While altcoins are also prominent in institutional acceptance after Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH) is leading in this regard. While Ethereum accumulation has also increased after BTC recently, the last move at this point came from Bitcoin miner BitMine Immersion Technologies. According to official statements, US-based Bitcoin mining company BitMine announced that it has made Ethereum the primary reserve asset. At this point, BitMine stated that it has gone to the capital increase path and will raise $250 million and will purchase Ethereum. The company also added that Tom Lee, a well-known Wall Street analyst, has been elected chairman of the board. The company stated that the capital increase was carried out under the leadership of MOZAYYX with the participation of a high-level investor group including Founders Fund, Pantera, FalconX, Republic Digital, Kraken, Galaxy Digital, DCG and Thomas Lee. Stablecoins are the “ChatGPT” of cryptocurrencies, said BitMine President Thomas Lee, adding that he expects Ethereum to follow suit. “Ethereum is the blockchain on which most stablecoin payments are made, so ETH should benefit from this growth,” Lee said. Tom Lee stated that BitMine will follow a strategy similar to MicroStrategy’s “BTC Yield” measure of Bitcoin per share. The company added that it will monitor the value of ETH held per share of the company as a key performance metric. BitMine’s move comes after SharpLink Gaming’s ETH moves, which is on its way to becoming Etheruem’s MicroStrategy. With its recent ETH purchases, SharpLink Gaming has become the world’s largest public ETH holder. Related News: Ethereum's MicroStrategy is Born!

2025-07-01T10:00:44,"Ethereum Just Got Its MicroStrategy—Tom Lee Bets On Soaring ETH Price","Nearly three years after the Merge formally switched Ethereum to proof-of-stake on 15 September 2022, a publicly listed Bitcoin miner is adopting the network’s native token as its primary treasury asset. BitMine Immersion Technologies (NYSE American: BMNR) on 30 June priced a $250 million private placement of 55,555,556 new shares at $4.50 each and appointed Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee as chairman. The company’s SEC filing and press release make the purpose explicit: all net proceeds will be used to acquire and stake ether, a move management likens to Michael Saylor’s now-legendary Bitcoin strategy at MicroStrategy. Tom Lee Goes Full MicroStrategy On Ethereum Speaking hours later on CNBC’s Squawk Box, Lee framed the pivot as a logical response to the explosive growth of stablecoins, most of which settle on Ethereum. “Stablecoins, which is the ChatGPT of crypto, because it’s viral adoption by consumers, businesses, banks and now even Visa,” he said, underscoring why a treasury heavy in ETH could become strategically indispensable. Ethereum’s proof-of-stake design means that large holders who validate blocks “secure the fidelity of stablecoins,” Lee continued. “When Goldman issues a stablecoin and JP Morgan [issues] it on Ethereum as a layer-one blockchain, they’re going to want to secure it by staking Ethereum.” Related Reading: Top Analyst Predicts Major Ethereum Rally Toward $4,000 As Shorts Hit All-Time Highs Lee tied the long-term upside to macro numbers the US Treasury itself has started to cite. Stablecoins today hover around $250 billion; Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently suggested the figure could hit $2 trillion—a potential ten-fold expansion that, in Lee’s words, would “insure dollar dominance.” Because Ethereum already underpins more than half of stable-value tokens, a multi-trillion-dollar stablecoin market would translate directly into rising transaction fees for the network and, by extension, higher staking rewards for BitMine’s planned validator clusters. The private-placement syndicate reads like a who’s-who roster from both TradFi and crypto: MOZAYYX led the round, joined by Founders Fund, Pantera, FalconX, Republic Digital, Kraken, Galaxy Digital, Digital Currency Group, Diametric Capital and Occam Crest. Closing is expected on or about 3 July, subject to NYSE American approval. BitMine, headquartered in Las Vegas, will immediately deploy the ETH position into staking, giving the miner a yield-bearing balance-sheet asset while reinforcing Ethereum’s security budget. “One of the key performance metrics for BitMine going forward is to increase the value of ETH held per share,” chief executive Jonathan Bates said in the statement. For investors, the comparison with MicroStrategy is unavoidable but imperfect. Saylor’s company amassed bitcoin under a proof-of-work regime that offers no native yield; BitMine’s ether can generate income through both staking rewards and potential capital-markets transactions collateralized by those staked coins. Related Reading: Strong Ethereum Accumulation Detected: LTH Buying Heavy During June Consolidation Yet both strategies share a central bet: that a scarce digital asset sitting at the core of global finance will appreciate faster than cash alternatives on a corporate balance sheet. Whether BitMine achieves MicroStrategy-level returns will depend on execution, regulatory clarity for staking, and—most of all—Ethereum’s price path. What is clear, however, is that corporate treasuries are beginning to see ether not merely as “gas” for decentralized applications but as a strategic reserve asset in its own right. From a market-structure vantage, the new treasury model could translate into meaningful price torque for Ether if it scales. MicroStrategy’s serial purchases have now absorbed nearly 600,000 BTC—around 2.8 percent of the 21 million-coin cap—and coincided with Bitcoin’s ascent from roughly $11,000 in August 2020, when the company made its first buy, to more than $107,000 today, a near-ten-fold move. BitMine’s opening salvo—$250 million, or about 100,000 ETH at current prices—represents barely 0.08 percent of Ethereum’s 122 million-coin supply, yet roughly 28 percent of that supply is already locked in staking contracts while net issuance has turned negative post-EIP-1559, shrinking the freely tradable float. If even a handful of additional balance sheets emulate this “ETH-as-reserve” playbook, the resulting demand shock could replicate the supply-squeeze dynamics that propelled Bitcoin into six-figure territory. At press time, Ether traded at $2,459.

2025-07-01T09:44:20,"Bitcoin Pepe price outlook as major German bank plans to provide crypto trading","German banking group Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe reportedly intends to launch crypto trading services, providing its more than 50 million customers with access to crypto trading by the summer of 2026. Dekabank, which is owned by Sparkassen, has been chosen to manage this new crypto service through the Sparkasse app, according to a Bloomberg report. The German Savings Banks Association (DSGV) stated that the Savings Banks Finance Group will offer “reliable access to a regulated crypto offering.” The DSGV also noted that the crypto service addresses existing demand and is covered under the European Union’s MiCA regulatory framework for crypto, which became effective in December. As more financial firms embrace crypto, early-stage projects such as Bitcoin Pepe are expected to benefit. The project is continuing strength in its presale. Shifting stance on Crypto in German banking Previously, Sparkassen executives had dismissed crypto-related services due to concerns about volatility and risk. The banking group also restricted crypto purchases for all customers in 2015. Despite this shift in direction, the DSGV reportedly emphasized that its “position remains clear, cryptocurrencies are highly speculative investments.” It was also stated that there would be no advertising for the new service, and customers would be informed about potential risks, including “potential for total loss.” Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe encompasses over 50 million customers and 500 companies, including more than 370 savings banks, with total aggregated assets under management exceeding 2.5 trillion euros ($2.9 trillion). Filipp Bolotov, founder and CEO of ERA Labs, commented on Sparkassen’s move into crypto, calling it a “big move for mainstream adoption.” Similarly, Kyle Chasse, a crypto venture capitalist and founder of Master Ventures, remarked that “banks are catching up.” Other German banks have also begun integrating crypto services. In September 2024, Germany’s second-largest financial institution, DZ Bank, partnered with Boerse Stuttgart Digital for a crypto service pilot. It planned to introduce trading and custody services to its network of 700 cooperative banks following an initial testing phase. Additionally, Germany’s largest federal bank, Landesbank Baden-Württemberg, announced in April of the previous year that it would offer crypto custody solutions to institutional clients in collaboration with Bitpanda, an Austria-based crypto exchange. Bitcoin Pepe makes new waves in crypto Bitcoin Pepe is establishing a unique position within the cryptocurrency market by integrating viral appeal with infrastructure development. This project operates as a Layer 2 solution, leveraging Bitcoin’s underlying security while aiming for scalability comparable to networks like Solana. This strategy differentiates it from many meme-centric cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin Pepe, noted as the first meme-focused Layer 2 solution built on Bitcoin, is also expanding its reach through strategic partnerships. These collaborations span various sectors, including gaming, content creation, decentralized finance (DeFi), and fair launch infrastructure. The objective of these partnerships is to cultivate an ecosystem where the BPEP token offers cross-chain utility and cultural relevance. Such alliances are intended to boost visibility and adoption, reflecting growing support for the PEP-20 token standard from both institutional entities and the wider community. The project’s infrastructure-focused approach appears to be attracting investor interest, with its ongoing presale having already secured over $16.2 million. Further contributing to its momentum are confirmed listings on the MEXC and BitMart exchanges. The project team is scheduled to make the final listing announcement on July 31st.

2025-07-01T09:34:42,"Bit Digital Makes A Massive Bet On Ethereum","Summary In June 2024, I rated Bit Digital a 'strong buy' due to its early and successful pivot to HPC revenue. Missed HPC revenue guidance, and shifting GPU market dynamics, made me less optimistic about long-term prospects later last year. A recent 75 million share offering and questionable capital allocation strategy further cloud the investment outlook, making me cautious on BTBT now. The company wants to spin out its HPC/AI subsidiary WhiteFiber via IPO. I believe shareholders would benefit from such a move. Bit Digital ( BTBT ) is one of the stocks I've covered the most for Seeking Alpha in recent years. It's also one of the few stocks that I have labeled with a 'strong buy' tag in the past. That strong buy call came last June and was predicated on the assumption that Bit Digital was a strong buyout candidate in a market that was seeing Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining stocks shift operations to HPC businesses. Bit Digital was one of the first companies to do this and to date is still one of the most successful examples of such a pivot. BTBT Calls (Seeking Alpha) More recently, I've soured a bit on the company's long-term prospects after annualized HPC revenue guidance was missed last year, market dynamics for GPU as-a-service models began to change , and Bit Digital embarked on a capital allocation strategy that I found to be questionable in my most recent piece from March. Subsequent to my March piece, we have another quarter of corporate performance and a recent capital raise to assess. Q1-25 Earnings The quarter ended-March was a fairly transformative one for Bit Digital. Not only did the company see a significant 17.4% reduction in top line revenue year over year, but the company's revenue from its Digital Asset Mining segment plummeted by 64.5% from Q1-24: Revenue Q1-25 Q1-24 YoY Digital Asset Mining $7,776,963 $21,891,760 -64.5% Cloud Services $14,842,286 $8,069,584 83.9% Colocation Services $1,644,663 $0 ETH Staking $560,641 $325,746 72.1% Other $280,567 $99,748 181.3% Total Revenue $25,105,120 $30,386,838 -17.4% Source: Bit Digital, Form 10-Q In spite of 84% year-over-year growth in revenue from Cloud Services, Bit Digital simply couldn't overcome the decline from mining to produce a positive year-over-year gain in the top line figure. For context, mining made up just 31% of Bit Digital's total revenue in Q1-25. That segment accounted for 72% of revenue in Q1-24 and 54% during the full year 2024. The decline in revenue from mining has been well telegraphed for several months. The company even stopped releasing monthly production numbers early in the year. Profit Margin Q1-25 Q1-24 YoY Digital Asset Mining 21.3% 40.7% -47.8% Cloud Services 59.0% 60.9% -3.1% Colocation Services 66.8% ETH Staking 94.2% 95.0% -0.8% Source: Bit Digital, Form 10-Q It certainly isn't a surprise to see the margin from mining collapse by 48% year over year. Q1-24 was the last full quarter of pre-halving Bitcoin production. CEO Sam Tabar has steadfastly opposed a hash-growth at any cost philosophy, and I think the transformation we're currently seeing in the company's business is proof of that. Still, there are concerns going forward. For instance, despite producing 59% gross margins in Q1-25, Bit Digital's Cloud Service revenue is still well below the $100 million annualized run rate that was expected by the end of last year. Operating income Q1-25 Q1-24 Total Revenue $25,105,120 $30,386,838 Opex Sans Digital Asset Gain/Loss -$28,268,205 -$28,960,381 Operating Income -$3,163,085 $1,426,457 Source: Bit Digital, Form 10-Q - Author's calculation Essentially, every public Bitcoin miner utilizes FASB accounting rules that allow the companies to show unrealized gains in the digital assets that they hold as income (or losses). Stripping that out from Bit Digital's report, we can see that the company flipped from positive operating income in Q1-24 to negative in Q1-25. This should be alleviated in the future as Bitcoin mining becomes a less significant driver of both COGS and revenue. That said, the company's recent capital allocation moves have been substantial. A Massive Wager On Ethereum Prior to releasing Q1 earnings, we already knew that Bit Digital was beginning to position as more of an Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) proxy than a Bitcoin proxy. The company held $91.3 million in ETH and $78.8 million in BTC at the end of January. Two months later, those figures were dramatically different: Digital Assets Quantity Cost Basis Fair Value BTC 417.6 $25,456,846 $34,474,294 ETH 24,434.20 $59,917,193 $44,556,466 Total digital assets held as of March 31, 2025 $85,374,039 $79,030,760 Source: Bit Digital, Form 10-Q At the end of January, ETH had a market value of $3,300 per coin. By the end of March, that price had been nearly cut in half, down to $1,800 per coin. This is what I said at the end of my March BTBT piece: This may be a spicy take, but if I were CEO Sam Tabar, I would completely abandon the ETH staking business entirely. There are two reasons for this. First, ETH has been a total drag on the company's digital asset value and I laid that out in the section above. That could certainly turn around, but that's far from a sure thing. The bigger issue is really simple; if Bit Digital can't rely on capital appreciation from ETH the way it can from BTC, then it would almost certainly be more beneficial for the company to deploy that capital differently. Last summer, the company had sold BTC and swapped it to ETH - that turned out to be a horrific decision with the benefit of hindsight. During Q1-25, the company sold even more BTC and hung on to its ETH. CEO Sam Tabar from the conference call: we also sold approximately $32 million worth of Bitcoin holdings during the quarter to help fund growth while managing our use of equity issuance . We did not sell any ETH during the quarter, but transferred 3,400 into an internally managed fund, which we do not count as treasury holdings. I've bolded part of the quote above because I think this is important. Leadership has openly acknowledged the poor optics associated with the size of the company's ATM relative to the market capitalization of BTBT stock. Given this, I find it strange that Bit Digital opted to raise capital through shareholder dilution to buy even more ETH. Capital Allocation & WhiteFiber IPO On June 26th, Bit Digital announced the pricing of $150 million equity raise at $2 per share for 75 million new shares of BTBT stock. Notably, the company's stock had closed at $2.35 per share the prior session. Thus, the offering came at a 15% discount to the market value of the stock just one day earlier. After underwriter fees, the company receives $142.5 million, with use of proceeds going toward purchasing ETH. It's hard for me to view this favorably for three reasons. Bit Digital just sold Digital Assets to fund growth rather than issuing equity, only to turn around just a couple months later and issue equity to buy Digital Assets. It's a rather striking 180. While the company's ETH staking is its best business segment by gross margin, the revenue from the segment is by far the smallest of four dis-aggregated business lines. Furthermore, the staking business may not be intense from an opex standpoint, but it does tie up a considerable amount of capital for a very small percentage of top line revenue. This move essentially triples down on a capital allocation strategy that hasn't been working. Namely, allowing Bit Digital's equity valuation to be dependent on a risk asset that has weak sentiment and arguably deteriorating fundamentals. All while the company wants to raise through an active ATM. In the prospectus, Bit Digital expressed conviction in the Ethereum ecosystem and specifically mentioned legislation around stablecoins in the US as cause for optimism: Given increased regulatory clarity, including the recently passed GENIUS Act, we view ETH as a digitally native store of value and foundational infrastructure for decentralized applications and stablecoins. Accordingly, we intend to grow our ETH position over time, supported by staking rewards. Looking past the fact that the GENIUS Act has actually not been passed yet by the House of Representatives, I see it as a risky move to further tie the valuation of the company to an asset that Bit Digital can't ultimately control rather than focusing on raising that capital to fund growth of WhiteFiber. On the latter, it's very interesting to me that Bit Digital is trying to spin out WhiteFiber. As a wholly owned subsidiary of Bit Digital, WhiteFiber submitted a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a proposed IPO. Share count and pricing of such an IPO have yet to be determined. But this would seem to be an attempt to get the same kind of value on its data center business that the market is currently giving companies like Core Scientific ( CORZ ) or IREN Limited ( IREN ) - each of which actually had less HPC/AI revenue than Bit Digital in Q1 yet continue to trade a much larger forward sales multiples than that of BTBT: Data by YCharts To some degree, I suspect the lack of apparent HPC respect for BTBT relative to peers is due to the company having such a large allocation to ETH. For those who would rather see Bit Digital focus capital on scaling cloud services, these ETH purchases are perhaps frustrating. But in the event WhiteFiber does IPO and is successfully spun out of BTBT, holding BTBT is perhaps warranted. Valuation And Assets Per the offering prospectus, there would be an estimated 283.5 million BTBT common shares outstanding following completion of the offering. By my math, that dilutes the current holder base by roughly 36%. And at a $2.19 share close on June 30th, Bit Digital has an implied valuation of $621 million at that 283.5 million shares count. Following the $150 million capital raise, Bit Digital will have about $204 million in ETH, $45 million in BTC, $297 million in non-current assets, and $99 million in combined cash and 'other current assets' as of Q1-25. Short of an absolute collapse in the price of Ethereum, stock price downside from here should be somewhat limited, provided the company doesn't continue to aggressively dilute. Closing Summary I think a WhiteFiber IPO would be a good thing for both Bit Digital and Bit Digital shareholders. It will allow the market to pick between two very different business models currently operated by one parent company. Given the substantial rallies we've seen from stocks like CoreWeave, Core Scientific, and IREN Limited on the proposed buyout of Core Scientific by CoreWeave, there's no reason Bit Digital shouldn't benefit from spinning out its HPC/AI subsidiary - especially given the segment revenue its doing relative to some of those other stocks mentioned. Having said all of this, I'm a bit concerned about Bit Digital's Ethereum reliance. Despite being well off its coin price highs, Ethereum is far from cheap on a circulating P/F ratio. A re-rating lower in ETH would severely impact Bit Digital's stock valuation. I'll reiterate the 'hold.'",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4798514-bit-digital-makes-massive-bet-ethereum?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BUSINESS|ETH|BTC|MINING|MARKET","ETH-USD|BTBT",cryptocompare
