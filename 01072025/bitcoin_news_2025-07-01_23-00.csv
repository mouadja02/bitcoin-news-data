2025-07-01T20:31:00,"European fintech Spiko integrates Chainlink’s CCIP for $380m money market funds","Money markets platform Spiko is tapping into Chainlink’s cross-chain interoperability protocol to enable multichain access to over $380 million in regulated on-chain funds. The European fintech announced on July 1, 2025, noting that it was integrating Chainlink ( LINK ), with the strategic aim of bolstering interoperability . Chainlink’s cross chain standard, CCIP, will enable more than $380 million of its institutional-grade onchain money market funds to be accessible to users much more easily and compliantly. “Until now, Spiko MMFs were deployed natively across multiple networks — but investors couldn’t move their shares from one chain to another. The only workaround was to redeem on Network A and re-subscribe on Network B — a clunky, time-consuming, and costly process. That’s officially a thing of the past,” Spiko posted on X. In this case, CCIP will power Spiko’s regulated money market funds, with these MMFs approved by France’s markets regulator. Chainlink will offer the cross-chain interoperability solution that will benefit users looking to tap into traditional financial instruments on-chain.

The two assets, backed by euro and U.S. dollar-denominated treasury bills, are the first EU-approved USD- and EUR-denominated money market funds whose shares are issued as fungible tokens on a public blockchain. It’s part of the massive tokenization trend currently being witnessed across the world. “By integrating CCIP, we’re extending our tokenized money market funds across chains while maintaining the compliance and operational standards required by institutional investors,” said Paul-Adrien Hyppolite, co-founder and chief executive officer of Spiko. Spiko aims to use Chainlink to scale access to its funds, with regulatory and operational standards around identity verification checks, such as know your customer and anti-money laundering. CCIP integration sees Spiko tap into another key blockchain-powered solution after the platform adopted Chainlink SmartData to offer real-time NAV reporting. Chainlink continues to attract massive adoption initiatives as its solutions power growth and traction for projects across decentralized finance, banking, and real-world assets, among others. Recently, Chainlink revealed a major move with the partnership with Mastercard .

2025-07-01T20:30:18,"MiCA regulations caused 82% of crypto media sites in Europe to lose traffic in Q1 2025","Crypto news sites across Europe lost visibility fast in the first three months of 2025 after MiCA rules kicked in. According to a detailed report from Outset, over 80% of crypto-native media in the region saw traffic fall. While MiCA mainly targets crypto service providers, not publishers, the rules swept up media outlets anyway, especially those running sponsored posts, affiliate links, or anything remotely promotional without the right disclaimers. In January, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) warned that even editorial content must be stripped of investment talk unless licenses are in place. Google responded quickly. Pages without proper disclaimers or jurisdiction tags got buried. Sites outside the EU weren’t safe either if their content targeted Europe in German, French, Dutch, or Spanish. The traffic drops weren’t just algorithmic. Geopolitical tensions and the broader crypto market downturn made the hits worse. Germany issued threats, and traffic collapsed anyway Germany had 34 crypto-native media outlets. By February, 21 of them were down. BaFin, the country’s regulator, issued public warnings about unlicensed “investment-like” promotion. Coin-Update lost over 51%. Krypto Magazin fell 45%. Cointelegraph Germany plunged 63%. March didn’t fix much—half the German outlets were still dropping. A few sites fought back with disclaimers and legal fine print. BitcoinBlog.de bounced up 47.4% in March. Krypto News and Kryptozeitung also posted small rebounds. Others stayed down for the count. The few winners—CryptoMonday, Blockzeit, CoinJournal DE, and Crypto Valley Journal—used stronger legal tagging and multilingual coverage. In total, just 9 German-language sites recorded any growth that quarter. CoinJournal DE benefited from its ownership by Investoo Group, a UK firm that owns a bunch of multilingual crypto sites optimized for SEO and local compliance. In 2020, Investoo added CoinJournal to its portfolio and later merged bitcoinmag.de into it. The combined traffic and shared legal infrastructure helped them hold steady during the crackdown. Other former Investoo brands like Kryptoszene.de, now independent, still saw growth. It probably pivoted to niche German-first content after the split. Blockchain Stories DE and Block-Builders.de also grew across the quarter. French outlets fell hard while only a few climbed back up France had 25 crypto-dedicated media outlets at the start of Q1. Most dropped. The Blog lost nearly 72%. Coinhouse, CryptoNews France, and Conseils Crypto each lost around 40%. Cointelegraph France underperformed even though it’s tied to Frekaz Group, which also owns Cointribune. Cointribune held up better, mostly due to its structure as a hybrid VC-media startup under Frekaz. But it wasn’t immune to search penalties. Franchise models, like Cointelegraph’s French edition, struggled more—limited backend access and lower investment in SEO made a difference. By March, things improved a bit. Stelareum climbed back up 9%. Blockchain France grew 72.64%. InvestX jumped 60.71%. Cryptoast and Bitcoin.fr also showed mild gains. In total, only four French outlets finished the quarter with stable growth: ActuCrypto.info, Blockchain France, The Market Periodical, and InvestX. All of them leaned on compliance tools, clear risk language, and wider language support. The Netherlands and Belgium didn’t pass new crypto media laws, but that didn’t protect anyone from Google. Dutch-speaking outlets took heavy hits in February. Out of 21 sites, over 76% lost traffic. Bitcoinexchangenederland.nl got wrecked—down 92.96%. Bitcoin Koers dropped more than 50%. Crypto Insiders fell even without regulatory pressure. The same pattern held in Spain and Italy. Spanish outlets were hit by the late 2024 ad rules from CNMV. By February, 70% had traffic losses. CriptoPasion dropped nearly 47%. Cointelegraph ES and BeInCrypto’s Spanish edition both lost around 20%. Bit2Me News was the outlier, up 149.40% after a spike in March. The rest stayed down. Italy also saw 70% of crypto media lose ground. The Cryptonomist dropped 42%. Cointelegraph Italy fell 46%. Only Borsainside grew. CONSOB’s early 2025 advisories didn’t help, especially for influencer-linked platforms. The UK wasn’t even part of MiCA , but got slammed anyway. The FCA started enforcing its own crypto ad rules in January. Five UK-facing crypto outlets were tracked. The Market Periodical and MyCryptoSpaceUK posted gains, but they were small—MyCryptoSpaceUK stayed under 10K monthly visits. Bitcourier and Cryptouk.io failed to recover. The Crypto Adviser surged in March, up 162.18%, but still couldn’t hit 4K visits. Q1 ended with 81.61% of crypto-native publishers in Europe down. January started with 26.57M visits across all outlets. By March, it was 22.22M. That’s a 16.37% drop in just two months. Only 16 outlets gained any traction, and just half of those had steady growth month to month. Traffic across Europe was mostly concentrated in a handful of sites. BTC Echo, Crypto Insiders, Cointribune, Bitcoin Magazine, Cointelegraph ES, and Newsbit’s Dutch and German versions had over 1M monthly visits. They made up 60% of all crypto media traffic. Lower-tier sites—those under 100K visits—added up to just 6.24% of the region’s traffic. Mid-level outlets filled in the rest. Germany and France led the region in audience. Italy and the UK underperformed. Belgium split between Dutch and English sites. Portugal had zero crypto-native publications. Meanwhile, mainstream financial sites outperformed crypto media. Of 46 broader media outlets, 25 gained traffic. Sites like Investing.com and Finanzen.net got over 100M visits combined. In Germany, 24% of top-performing generalist outlets were based locally. Italy’s big players—like FinanzaOnline—brought in millions. Spain’s finance media also held up. Only 32% of those mainstream finance outlets were consistently in Google Discover. Sites like boursier.com, finanzen.at, and es.investing.com were regulars. Nine of those broke 1M visits. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

2025-07-01T20:10:02,"€748 billion UniCredit reveals capital protected Bitcoin ETF","Italy’s second-largest bank, UniCredit SpA has launched a capital investment certificate spanning a five-year time period. The product is tied to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). It appears that European banks are ready to move beyond their skepticism of cryptocurrencies and start participating meaningfully in the digital asset market as UniCredit SpA, one of Europe’s largest banking institutions with €748B ($881B) in assets, launches a new structured product tied to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). The product is exclusively targeted at professional clients and offers full capital protection at maturity. The five-year, dollar-denominated investment certificate will mirror the performance of BlackRock’s IBIT ETF. UniCredit reveals capital protected Bitcoin ETF According to a memo reviewed by Bloomberg News and confirmed by UniCredit, the certificate guarantees 100% capital protection at maturity while capping the maximum return at 85% of the ETF’s performance. The product is set to be available for subscription from July 1 to July 28, with a minimum investment requirement of $25,000. While capped returns may not appeal to high-risk traders, they offer a palatable entry point for investors still wary of the notorious volatility of cryptocurrencies. This kind of investment structure is often called a “capital-protected note,” and it is typically used in volatile or emerging asset classes where investor confidence may be low. “We are seeing increasing interest from professional investors in instruments tied to emerging asset classes such as cryptocurrencies,” Chicco di Stasi, UniCredit’s head of Group Investment Product Solutions and Equity & Credit Sales and Trading, said. “With this product, we offer our professional clients a distinctive solution — the first of its kind in Italy.” Bitcoin has outperformed much of the broader crypto market in 2025, and has gained approximately 14% year-to-date, while many smaller tokens have experienced steep losses. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) , launched by BlackRock, has played a pivotal role in mainstreaming Bitcoin investment. Since its approval by U.S. regulators in January 2024, the ETF has grown to over $75B in assets under management, making it one of the most successful exchange-traded funds of all time. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has also launched a separate Bitcoin ETP in Europe. Italian and European banks consider crypto expansion European banks are cautiously stepping into the digital asset industry. Earlier this year, Intesa Sanpaolo SpA, Italy’s largest banking group, confirmed its first spot Bitcoin purchase and launched a digital asset trading desk for institutional clients. Spain’s Banco Santander SA is also reportedly exploring options to expand its digital asset offerings. The bank is in early-stage planning to launch a stablecoin and provide access to cryptocurrencies for retail clients through its digital banking arm. Across the European Union, regulatory clarity around digital assets has improved with the gradual rollout of MiCA , the Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation, which is aimed at bringing more transparency and consumer protection to the industry. European investor interest in crypto is rebounding following a turbulent 2022 and 2023, which was marked by high-profile crypto firm bankruptcies and market volatility. The success of UniCredit’s product could prompt the company to expand its digital asset offerings further and encourage even more European banks to follow suit.

The crypto market cap declined by around 4 percent in the past 24 hours to hover about $3.366 trillion on Tuesday, July 1, during the mid-North American trading session. Amid the midterm crypto bearish outlook, on-chain data analysis shows institutional investors have continued to accumulate relentlessly. For instance, the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, led by BlackRock’s IBIT, recorded a net cash inflow of about $102 million on Monday, thus registering 15 consecutive days of cash inflows. Will U.S. SEC’s Approval of Spot Altcoin ETF Trigger Market Reversal? The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has remained on the side of pro-crypto regulations since the 2nd inauguration of President Donald Trump. On Tuesday, the SEC granted approval to the conversion of Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap (GDLC) Fund into an ETF. The Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund, which has about $774 million in Assets Under Management (AUM), holds several digital assets led by Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. The approval of the GDLC‘s conversion to ETF is a major milestone for the entire altcoin market, which has been expecting more spot ETF approval in the coming months. As a result, the approval will play a crucial role in net crypto traded volume during the next few months. The expected demand growth in the spot market will likely trigger a bullish reversal in the near term. Midterm Expectations Following the approval of GDLC conversion to an ETF product, the odds of an altseason in the near term have significantly surged. Furthermore, the U.S. SEC will imminently approve more crypto spot ETFs in the near future. Yes, this is what everyone wants, what makes sense and what we think will happen and why we so bullish (95% on most of the coins) approval. Q is what will the standards be. We think they'll likely be loose enough where the vast majority of Top 50 coins would be ok to be ETF-ized. https://t.co/1AUZOmpe1O — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 1, 2025 With most altcoins attempting to mirror Bitcoin’s compound growth, incorporating Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) might prove profitable by the end of this year.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/u-s-sec-approves-first-solana-xrp-and-cardano-etf-is-the-altcoin-summer-next/,"ALTCOIN|REGULATION|BTC|ADA|MARKET","News|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations|Ethereum|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

SEC lawsuit is nearing a conclusion following the crypto firm’s decision to drop its cross-appeal. Now, a crypto commentator has drawn the XRP community’s attention to July 3 as an important date to look forward to, as the SEC also moves to drop its appeal. All Eyes on July 3 as Ripple vs. SEC Lawsuit Concludes In an X post , crypto commentator Captain Redbeard declared that July 3 is the moment of truth, with the SEC set to have a closed-door meeting on that day. He noted that Ripple has dropped its cross-appeal and that the Commission’s next move could end it all. Captain Redbeard added that if the agency follows through in dropping its appeal in the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit, XRP is about to rip . He then remarked that game-changing clarity is within reach. Bitcoinist reported that Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse had announced that his firm was dropping its cross-appeal. He also mentioned that the SEC is expected to do the same, as they promised initially. However, the agency is expected to have a Commissioner’s vote before it drops the appeal in the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit. However, contrary to Captain Redbeard’s opinion, ex-SEC lawyer Marc Fagel has clarified that July 3 isn’t necessarily concerning the vote on whether to drop the appeal. In an X post , Fagel noted that the proposed closed-door meeting happens every week and that the agenda is confidential. As such, it is impossible to know whether they will vote to drop the appeal in the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit at that meeting. The legal expert further remarked that the vote to dismiss the appeal could happen any Thursday in the future. He added that they could also approve the dismissal through a completely different mechanism. What Needs To Be Done Before The Lawsuit Can End In another X post , Marc Fagel gave a breakdown of what needs to happen before the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit can finally end. He stated that the Commission likely still needs to vote to dismiss the appeal. Once that is done, then both parties will need to submit papers dismissing their respective appeals, after which the district court’s order goes into effect. Fagel explained that these procedures could take several weeks or more. However, it could be expedited, and so, there is no set timeframe. Meanwhile, he suggested that the XRP community shouldn’t get their hopes up about a vote to drop the appeal in the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit happening on July 3. The lawyer stated that it is almost certain that they won’t vote on this on Thursday. He admitted that he isn’t privy to the confidential agenda but that voting on the appeal would be highly unusual. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.22, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-vs-sec-lawsuit-nears-end/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Ripple|Brad Garlinghouse|Captain Redbeard|Coinmarketcap|Marc Fagel|ripple|ripple news|US SEC|XRP|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT",cryptocompare
2025-07-01T20:00:25,"Genius Mathematician Urges XRP Holders to Buckle Up. Here’s why","A bold mathematical prediction has ignited excitement among XRP holders, thanks to a viral video shared by Levi of Crypto Crusaders. In the clip, a mathematician named Giovanni uses advanced modeling techniques to forecast Bitcoin’s future, and by extension, offers a compelling glimpse into XRP’s explosive potential. As the market enters a critical phase, his insights are urging XRP investors to prepare for what could be a dramatic uptrend. The Math Behind Bitcoin’s Explosive Future Giovanni’s analysis relies on a combination of regression lines and a power law formula, in which Bitcoin’s price is proportional to time raised to the power of six. Here, time refers to the age of the Bitcoin network, and the “power” amplifies the value growth exponentially. According to Giovanni, this model forecasts that Bitcoin will hit $1 million per coin in eight years, and $10 million in two decades. These projections may sound ambitious, but they are grounded in historical trends and logarithmic growth patterns, not mere speculation. GENIUS Mathematician Urges XRP Holders To BUCKLE UP! #XRP pic.twitter.com/B0vCVoKSA7 — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) June 30, 2025 This model suggests that Bitcoin’s price has historically followed a mathematically consistent upward curve that reflects not just market hype but the intrinsic maturation of its decentralized network. As the system ages, the price naturally escalates along the curve, making this forecast particularly powerful for long-term investors. Why XRP Could Outperform Bitcoin Levi of Crypto Crusaders takes Giovanni’s projection a step further by connecting it to XRP’s historical behavior. He notes that while Bitcoin drives the market, XRP often mirrors its performance, but with significantly greater gains. During the last major bull move, when Bitcoin rose from $50,000 to around $110,000 (a 2x increase), XRP surged from $0.50 to about $3, a 6x rally. Levi applies this same ratio to current market levels. With Bitcoin now trading at approximately $106,232 and XRP at $2.19, he argues that if Bitcoin reaches the projected $150,000 to $200,000 range during this cycle, XRP could logically climb to between $15 and $25. His conservative estimate places XRP at $20 at the cycle’s peak, an outcome that fits with previous market dynamics and historical correlations. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Conditions and XRP’s Current Position At present, XRP trades around $2.19, showing significant strength amid broader market optimism. Bitcoin’s steady climb has created favorable tailwinds, and XRP appears to be gaining momentum as investor confidence returns. With the SEC litigation largely behind Ripple, regulatory uncertainties that once held XRP back are quickly fading. Moreover, Ripple’s increasing global footprint in payments infrastructure, along with rising institutional interest in XRP-related services, adds fundamental support to these bullish technical projections. XRP’s unique utility in cross-border finance continues to distinguish it from many other altcoins, enhancing its credibility as a high-upside asset in the evolving financial ecosystem. Buckle Up: A Mathematical and Market-Driven Call Giovanni’s prediction, backed by decades of trend analysis, aligns perfectly with what seasoned XRP analysts like Levi have observed over multiple market cycles. If Bitcoin does peak in the $200,000 range as the model suggests, XRP’s amplified response could create generational wealth for long-term holders. For those positioned early, the message is clear: buckle up. The next wave may not only validate this bold mathematical model, but it could also solidify XRP’s place among the most explosive assets in the crypto market.

2025-07-01T19:55:35,"Man Allegedly Converts $1,700,000 Worth of Fake Checks and Fraudulent Wire Transfers Into Bitcoin After Multiple Scams","A central New York man is currently in custody for turning $1.7 million worth of fraudulent checks into Bitcoin ( BTC ). According to official District of Rhode Island court documents , Tushal Rathod has been charged with wire fraud, money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Court documents show an affidavit by FBI special agent Samuel Morgan detailing Rathod’s allegations. From 2022 to 2024, Morgan alleges Rathod collected nearly $2 million in fraudulent checks and business email compromise (BEC) fraud. According to the affidavit, “During a BEC, scammers obtain the login credentials of an email user of a business email account. Typically, the credentials are obtained during a ‘spearphishing’ cyber campaign.” In a BEC, thieves use the stolen credentials to monitor e-mail transactions, stepping in with fraudulent communications over sensitive matters like upcoming financial transactions. BECs sometimes even involve malware. Rathod allegedly then spread the fraudulent funds out across seven accounts in six different banks. Furthermore, most of those funds were then converted into BTC. Rathod allegedly worked with several co-conspirators and took on different names to different people. Says Morgan, “In my training and experience, I know that fraudsters and individuals who conduct BEC schemes often work with a vast network of money launderers to help them ‘clean’ funds and then re-integrate the ‘cleaned’ funds into the economy so that the funds can be used free from the taint of criminal activity. This allows the scammers to profit from their fraudulent conduct and to avoid getting caught.” Rathod was arrested and arraigned last Wednesday.

2025-07-01T19:40:46,"Buffett Indicator hit 205%, signaling extreme market overvaluation","The Warren Buffett Indicator has climbed to 205%, the highest point ever tracked. That figure officially tops levels seen during both the Dot Com Bubble and the 2008 Financial Crisis. It means the total market cap of US stocks now sits at more than double the country’s GDP, marking the most expensive valuation on record. The market hit this milestone just as trading began for the second half of 2025, and Wall Street’s reaction? Flat. Stocks barely moved. The metric may be screaming red, but traders seem to be holding their breath. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 426 points, or 1%, while the S&P 500 hovered near the flatline and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.6%. The Dow’s movement came after a change in trading behavior. Investors dumped tech names like Microsoft and Nvidia, two of the biggest winners in Q2, and rotated into health-care firms. Amgen, Merck, and UnitedHealth each jumped close to 3%, while Johnson & Johnson added almost 2%. The tech-heavy Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund, which gained nearly 23% last quarter, started Q3 down 1%. Trump tax bill passes Senate as Musk slams it, Powell hints at pause President Donald Trump’s new tax and spending bill passed the Senate on Tuesday with a narrow 51-50 vote. The legislation, which includes sweeping budget changes, now moves to the House. But it’s already facing public criticism from major corporate names. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, called the bill “utterly insane and destructive” on Truth Social. In response, Trump posted on the same platform calling for the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to investigate the government subsidies that Musk’s companies have collected. This is the second time this year the two have clashed over federal funding and regulatory priorities. Elon’s reaction came on the same day Tesla stock dropped more than 5%. It was one of the worst-performing names among large caps. His public comments raised concerns about political backlash against clean energy subsidies, a key part of Tesla’s business model. Elsewhere, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave a policy update during a European Central Bank panel in Portugal. Powell said that without Trump’s tariffs, the Fed would have likely cut interest rates again by now. “In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence,” Powell said . He didn’t clarify whether July would be too soon for another move, instead saying any decision would be based on data. Corporate bitcoin buying overtakes ETFs for third quarter On the crypto side, corporate buying of bitcoin continued to outpace ETFs for the third straight quarter. Public companies added around 131,000 BTC in Q2, increasing their holdings by 18%. In comparison, ETFs added 111,000 BTC, a growth of 8%. Leading the pack is Strategy, still holding the largest stash among public companies. But others are catching on. Ben Werkman, Chief Investment Officer at Swan Bitcoin, said the landscape is shifting. “It’s going to be very hard to catch Strategy’s scale,” Werkman said. “They’re going to be the preferred landing spot for institutional capital because of the deep liquidity around their equity, while these smaller equities are going to be really good risk returns for retail investors and smaller institutions that want more of that upside.” Back on Wall Street, Berkshire Hathaway’s stocks responded to the Buffett hype. Class A shares closed at $733,214.44, up $4,414.44 or 0.61%, while Class B shares ended the day at $488.70, rising 0.60%. These gains came as the Buffett Indicator dominated headlines, though the company’s performance had no direct link to the broader market overvaluation that the metric tracks. Markets had already recovered significantly after their April slide, triggered by Trump’s aggressive tariff policies. Back then, the S&P 500 flirted with bear market territory. Since then, things have turned. The S&P 500 closed out Q2 with a 10.6% gain, and the Nasdaq jumped nearly 18%.

This prestigious position is typically reserved for a handful of U.S. companies whose operating profits exceed $10 billion quarterly by generating billions in revenue. According to a July 1 Bloomberg report , Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy) has now secured membership in this Wall Street elite circle. Michael Saylor’s Strategy to Join Wall Street Elite With $14 Billion Windfall https://t.co/TUXH3nEpy9 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) July 1, 2025 The dramatic turnaround from near-obscurity stems from Bitcoin’s price recovery in April and May and a recent accounting methodology change at Strategy regarding the valuation of its substantial cryptocurrency holdings. Per Bloomberg projections, Strategy is expected to generate approximately $112.8 million in second-quarter revenue from its traditional software operations. Critics Double Down on Saylor’s Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Despite Record Performance The anticipated record profit for the quarter ending June 30 comes amid intensified criticism from prominent skeptics, including renowned short-seller Jim Chanos. During a recent Odd Lots podcast episode titled “On the Absurdity of Bitcoin Treasury Companies,” Chanos criticized Strategy’s treasury strategy and advised investors to short MSTR stock while purchasing Bitcoin directly, betting that the large premium the stock commands over its token holdings will eventually contract. Noted short-seller Jim Chanos is now shorting shares of Strategy (formerly @MicroStrategy ) while simultaneously buying Bitcoin directly. #JimChanos #Bitcoin https://t.co/EKkOhUWttz — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 15, 2025 Chanos shared Strategy’s latest Bitcoin acquisition data, commenting: “It looks like Saylor will be happy to sell you some more MSTR stock, as he tapped the common equity ATM for over half a billion dollars again last week.” In that case, it looks like Saylor will be happy to sell you some more $MSTR stock, as he tapped the common equity ATM for over half a billion dollars again last week. pic.twitter.com/N8Sp0t26yO — James Chanos (@RealJimChanos) June 30, 2025 The Wall Street investor also revealed insider information suggesting that Strategy was being considered for S&P 500 inclusion, though this decision has reportedly been delayed until September. However, Saylor maintains that most critics fundamentally misunderstand Strategy’s business model. He has faced criticism for over four years, yet his company has dramatically outperformed both single stocks and the broader S&P 500 index. Strategy’s shares (MSTR) have skyrocketed more than 3,130% since Saylor initiated Bitcoin purchases in mid-2020 as an inflation hedge. Source: Google Finance During the same timeframe, Bitcoin has gained approximately 1,000%, while the S&P 500 has risen around 115%.

Recall that Strategy concluded its strongest month since November 2024 with a 32% surge in April, closing at $380.11, up from $288 at the period’s start. Strategy Accounting Changes Drive Q2 Profitability as Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Spreads Strategy’s substantial Bitcoin holdings are beginning to translate into profitability primarily due to anticipated modifications in cryptocurrency asset accounting regulations. Despite widespread awareness of the accounting methodology change , the first-quarter loss has attracted several class-action lawsuits alleging that Strategy executives made false and misleading statements that harmed shareholders. Strategy stated its intention to “vigorously defend against these claims” in a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing . Saylor’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy has inspired numerous imitators seeking to replicate his success. Other companies are also adapting the approach for different cryptocurrency tokens. For example, SharpLink Gaming Inc. is accumulating Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, while Upexi Inc. recently raised $100 million to purchase Solana tokens. SharpLink Gaming has emerged as the world’s largest publicly traded holder of Ethereum (ETH), after acquiring 176,271 ETH for $463 million. #ETH #Sharplink https://t.co/ynahjYt7Hd — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 13, 2025 A group of hedge fund executives recently attempted to raise $100 million to acquire BNB, Binance’s native token , through a publicly traded vehicle.

2025-07-01T19:30:00,"Senate passes Trump’s massive budget bill, with no mentions of crypto or Bitcoin","Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” passed the Senate, but without any provisions related to the crypto industry. Trump’s budget bill passed the Senate, but the crypto industry has little to celebrate. On Tuesday, June 1, the U.S. Senate passed the sweeping budget bill, with a razor-thin margin. Yet, despite Donald Trump’s past vocal support for the crypto industry, the bill had no crypto-related provisions. Specifically, there was no mention of “digital assets,” “Bitcoin,” “Ethereum,” “crypto,” “web3,” or “blockchain” anywhere in the over 1000-page bill. This is despite specific efforts by pro-crypto Senators to include tax breaks for the industry in the bill. Notably, Senator Cynthia Lummis, a vocal advocate for digital assets, argued for changing the tax code for crypto mining and staking. She argued that miners and stakers were taxed twice, once when they received block rewards and then again when they had to sell them. For years, miners and stakers have been taxed TWICE. Once when they receive block rewards, and again when they sell it. It’s time to stop this unfair tax treatment and ensure America is the world’s Bitcoin and Crypto Superpower. 🇺🇸 — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) June 30, 2025 You might also like: Senator Lummis pushes for crypto-friendly amendments in Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill Miners and stakers seek relief from taxation Currently, the IRS classifies profits from crypto mining and staking as income, which is taxed at fair market value at the time of receiving them. Once the miners sell their crypto, they have to report capital gains and pay a flat rate on these profits. While these taxes don’t strictly entail double taxation, miners and stakers complain that the system is overly burdensome. Namely, they have to pay taxes before realizing any profits, or before converting any crypto to fiat. You might also like: Guide to paying taxes on cryptocurrency income Lummis also advocated for tax exemptions for small crypto transactions, or a “de minimis” rule. These are often transactions that involve small payments for gas fees, small transfers, etc. While transactions don’t generate much tax income, they are a significant burden when it comes to tax reporting. The crypto industry was one of the biggest donors in the November 2024 elections. They supported candidates from both parties, raising over $190 million for their campaigns.

2025-07-01T19:29:48,"Socialist Zohran Mamdani may become a New York mayor. Why does crypto X push against him?","33-year-old socialist Zohran Mamdani became a surprise favorite among the NYC mayoral candidates from the Democratic Party and is considered a likely winner in the election. Mamdani’s socialist platform is criticized for being naive and unrealistic. However, his popularity is a signal to capitalists that the masses of New Yorkers are unheard of. Why does crypto X blast Mamdani? Is he an enemy of cryptocurrencies? Table of Contents Zohran Mamdani’s background and platform Can Mamdani save New York? Why does Crypto Twitter not like Mamdani? Conclusion Zohran Mamdani’s background and platform Zohran Mamdani’s parents are Ugandan academic and political commentator Mahmood Mamdani and award-winning Indian American filmmaker Mira Nair. Mamdani’s family moved to the USA from Uganda when Zohran was seven. Mamdani is Muslim and an outspoken socialist. He criticizes Israel’s actions in Palestine while opposing anti-semitism at the same time. Mamdani has a degree in African studies. Prior to starting a political career, he worked as a housing counselor. He has been a member of the New York State Assembly from the 36th district since 2021. Mamdani announced he is running for mayor of New York in October 2024. His platform is based on the idea that New York got too expensive to live in for working-class New Yorkers, which is true, given that even one-bedroom apartments in working-class districts can cost over $3,000 or even $4,000 per month. Mamdani’s supporters use slogans such as “Freeze the Rent” and “A City We Can Afford” while Mamdani is addressing the cost-of-living crisis in his speeches. His initiatives include abolishing payment for the use of buses, creating affordable city-owned grocery stores across the city, providing public child care, freezing housing prices, and building more affordable houses. These ideas resonated with young lodgers of New York and Asian and Latinx voters. In June, Mamdani became the leading candidate from the Democratic Party, beating former New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary. Mamdani’s success scared and angered Republicans, big business, and some of the moderate Democrats. Can Mamdani save New York? Just like Donald Trump before the presidency, Mamdani is criticized for lacking real experience in politics. His success owes much to social media and efficient promotion. The assembly years of Mamdani weren’t marked with any achievements. Now that his campaign has proved to be victorious, critics worry about a possible disastrous mayoral term of Mamdani. Mamdani’s ideas are criticized for being naive and even harmful : rent grows slower than the maintenance costs for apartment owners, while the promise to build affordable housing projects totally ignores the fact that New York has already been championing this strategy for many years. More than that, the rent prices for 40% of apartments are already controlled (landlords cannot raise the cost more than 5% a year). This policy shows poor results as the uncontrolled housing gets costlier, while controlled housing loses in quality as landlords cut expenses. Freezing the rent altogether will only make it worse. Mamdani’s plan to tax the rich to pay off his public projects may also find opposition from the governor and state legislature. As for the buses, critics say that free buses will attract new passengers who now use the subway. This pressure may worsen the traffic jam situation. Why does Crypto Twitter not like Mamdani? It seems that many of Mamdani’s plans are too hard to materialize, or they are just bad at their core. However, Crypto X (Twitter) has one more reason to hate a new Democratic leader: he is not a cryptocurrency champion, while his opponents in the election are pro-crypto. Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa promised to widen the Bitcoin ATM infrastructure back in 2021. Also, he was urging local businesses to start accepting crypto payments. The incumbent NYC mayor, who is going to get re-elected as an independent candidate, Eric Adams, is a crypto advocate who famously said that he received his first three mayoral paychecks in Bitcoin. Adams was calling New Yorkers to oppose Bitlicense, a framework that stalls cryptocurrency business in New York, and participated in various other cryptocurrency initiatives. As NYC #Mayor , I will make #NYC the most cryptocurrency-friendly city in the nation Property taxes, fines & fees will be payable in #crypto We will open more crypto ATMs & incentivize businesses to accept crypto We must modernize our economy & make it accessible for ALL! pic.twitter.com/WW2zPncEps — Curtis Sliwa (@CurtisSliwa) September 1, 2021 Read more: New York Mayor Pushes State to Drop “Stifling” BitLicense Program Mamdani is not a strong crypto proponent. He used a cryptocurrency topic as the reason to criticize former governor Andrew Cuomo, calling him out for advising an OKX exchange that broke local rules and had to pay $505 million in fines. Andrew Cuomo could’ve spent the years since his resignation making amends and helping New Yorkers. Instead he hounded the women who spoke out about his serial harassment, fought to keep his book deal millions…and advised a foreign crypto exchange that broke US law. pic.twitter.com/kBxkNGdrgA — Zohran Kwame Mamdani (@ZohranKMamdani) April 2, 2025 In 2023, Mamdani called to tighten regulations on cryptocurrency in New York, despite the fact that New York is already a tough jurisdiction for cryptocurrency businesses. Basically, that’s all Mamdani had to say about crypto during his lifetime. When crypto companies collapse, it isn’t the rich who suffer, it’s small investors who disproportionately come from low-income and communities of color. @NewYorkStateAG has a bill to address this and protect New York investors. Let’s do it! https://t.co/z0lCuPzkK9 — Zohran Kwame Mamdani (@ZohranKMamdani) May 11, 2023 It is not Mamdani’s lack of support for crypto, nor the weakness of his platform, that is the target for Crypto Twitter. It seems that many in the community simply hate Mamdani for being a socialist, Israeli military aggression critic, and “tax the rich” proponent. Some even point at his Ugandan roots as a problem or bring up the fact that Mamdani is not poor himself, as if it means he is not honest with the voters. Your mom lets you stay in her $2 million condo in Chelsea. Why are you pandering? You are rich. You are a nepo baby. https://t.co/uq8bbSjHP9 — Laura Loomer (@LauraLoomer) June 30, 2025 As many big figures in the crypto community don’t have reservations about being or becoming ultrawealthy, they seem to be angered and scared by the sudden success of Mamdani, who claimed, “I don’t think we should have billionaires because it is so much money in a moment of such inequality.” Zohran Mamdani: “I don't think that we should have billionaires.” Do you agree? Is there a point in being a billionaire besides for power? pic.twitter.com/zEyE0yHHp1 — Brian Krassenstein (@krassenstein) June 29, 2025 Billionaire and hedge fund manager Bill Ackman is one of the most concerned about Mamdani’s person on X. He cites the poorly based post suggesting that the results in the Democratic primary are not impressive as a thoughtful piece, and reposts various tweets that bring up Mamdani’s remoteness from the working class or his distaste for Benjamin Netanyahu as problematic. Socialism is a mental disease spread by those looking to prey on the economically illiterate. — Anthony Pompliano 🌪 (@APompliano) June 30, 2025 One of the retweeted posts is by Anthony Pompliano, a cryptocurrency podcaster and the new CEO of the ProCap BTC Bitcoin treasury company. On his podcast, he shared a clip in which ​​market analyst Jordi Visser explains why the youth lean toward socialism. Frustration and the feeling that the system is failing them are to blame. Visser, however, sees that Bitcoin may be the way out–something that is missing from Mamdani’s platform. In the same video, Pompliano shares the text from a venture capitalist, Peter Thiel, who cites student debt, unaffordable housing, long-term negative capital, no stake in the capitalist system, and the lack of eagerness of the boomer generation to pass the power to younger generations. Interestingly, Pompliano suggests that the solution for the youth would be copying the behavior of successful people of the past: accumulating capital, embracing new technologies, and taking risks–diving into the Bitcoin space matches all three suggestions. However, it only emphasizes that the old-school pipeline of the American Dream is systematically broken, and Bitcoin is one of the newer bypasses in the post-2008-and-2020-crises world order. Gemini exchange co-founder Tyler Winklevoss made a viral post condemning the youth supporting Mamdani. He concluded that socialism can be a hard lesson for Zoomers and millennials to learn why socialism is a bad idea. A lot of people have asked me if I will get involved in the NYC mayor race by supporting a candidate that can defeat Zohran Mamdani. TBH, I’m torn and undecided. Like every other city run by democrats, NYC is a broken kleptocracy. Taxes are astronomical and services are pathetic… — Tyler Winklevoss (@tyler) June 26, 2025 However, many in the comment section pointed out that instead of speaking about how good it is for New Yorkers to “learn it the hard way,” Winklevoss could come up with a more positive program, for instance, educating the youth about dangers of socialism the same way Mamdani earned his popularity–via social media, or just through “throwing good money at [capitalism] to work outside your trust fund.” Blaming socialism for millennial disillusionment is wild when it was capitalism—2008, student debt, unaffordable housing—that radicalized millennials. Also rich (ha): a billionaire crypto mogul lecturing NYC on kleptocracy while VC money launders luxury towers and rig… — efficientenzyme (@efficientenzyme) June 26, 2025 Conclusion New York is home to Gemini, MoonPay, Circle, Paxos, and other cryptocurrency projects. The mayor of the city will have an impact on the crypto industry of the U.S., per se. The probable victory of Mamdani casts a shadow on the prospects of the cryptocurrency business in New York, as the crypto sector is nonexistent in his campaign. It’s four months until the November election, and things can change.

2025-07-01T19:20:45,"Japanese Game Developer CyberStep Pioneers Ambitious $6.96M Crypto Reserve for Web3 Future","BitcoinWorld Japanese Game Developer CyberStep Pioneers Ambitious $6.96M Crypto Reserve for Web3 Future In a significant move signaling the growing convergence of traditional entertainment and decentralized finance, CyberStep, a prominent Japanese game developer renowned for its popular online claw machine game Toreba, has launched an ambitious new initiative. This strategic pivot into the digital asset space marks a bold step, setting a precedent for how established gaming companies are embracing the future of finance and technology. Why is this Japanese Game Developer Making Waves? CyberStep’s decision to dive deep into the cryptocurrency world isn’t just a fleeting trend; it’s a calculated move. On July 1, the company officially unveiled CRYPTECH Capital, a dedicated division poised to manage its foray into digital assets. This isn’t merely about dabbling; it’s about establishing a robust foundation within the burgeoning Web3 ecosystem. For a leading Japanese game developer , this move underscores a belief in the long-term viability and transformative potential of blockchain technology, especially as it relates to interactive entertainment. Building a Strategic Crypto Reserve: The Vision At the heart of CyberStep’s new venture is the commitment to building a substantial crypto reserve . The company’s strategy involves converting tokens generated from its various Web3 services into established major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). These assets will then be held on the company’s balance sheet, providing a stable foundation and potentially new avenues for growth. This approach demonstrates a clear understanding of market dynamics, opting for blue-chip cryptocurrencies known for their liquidity and relative stability within the volatile crypto landscape. CyberStep’s Bold Digital Asset Strategy Unpacked The financial commitment behind this initiative is noteworthy. CyberStep has initially allocated 200 million yen (approximately $1.39 million) for immediate crypto purchases within the fiscal year ending May 2026. This initial investment is just the beginning. The long-term vision for this digital asset strategy is to expand the reserve significantly, aiming for a target of 1 billion yen (around $6.96 million), contingent on favorable market conditions. This phased approach allows the company flexibility to adapt to market fluctuations while steadily building its digital asset portfolio. It’s a pragmatic and forward-thinking strategy for managing risk and maximizing potential returns. The Future of Web3 Gaming and Beyond CyberStep’s move highlights a broader trend: the increasing integration of blockchain technology into the gaming industry. The creation of Web3 services, which leverage decentralized technologies, is a key component of this shift. By converting tokens from these services into major cryptocurrencies, CyberStep is not only diversifying its assets but also strengthening its commitment to the decentralized future. This could pave the way for more innovative in-game economies, true digital ownership for players, and new forms of interaction within the Web3 gaming sphere. It positions CyberStep at the forefront of this evolving digital frontier, potentially inspiring other traditional game developers to explore similar paths. What Does This Mean for CyberStep Crypto Holdings? The establishment of CRYPTECH Capital and the accumulation of a substantial CyberStep crypto reserve could have several implications: Enhanced Financial Stability: Holding major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH can act as a hedge against inflation and offer diversification from traditional fiat currencies. Future Investment Opportunities: A strong digital asset base provides capital for future Web3 projects, acquisitions, or partnerships. Industry Leadership: By proactively embracing crypto, CyberStep solidifies its position as an innovator in the gaming and tech sectors. Player Engagement: The integration of Web3 elements could lead to more engaging and rewarding experiences for players, potentially increasing user retention and growth for games like Toreba. This strategic decision reflects a growing confidence among established companies in the long-term value and utility of digital assets. CyberStep’s ambitious venture into building a significant crypto reserve through CRYPTECH Capital is a clear signal of the evolving landscape where gaming, technology, and finance intertwine. This Japanese game developer is not just observing the Web3 revolution; it’s actively participating, aiming to secure its financial future and innovate within the digital realm. Their strategic approach, focusing on major cryptocurrencies and a phased investment, sets a compelling example for other traditional businesses considering a leap into the decentralized world. As the digital economy continues to expand, CyberStep’s proactive stance positions it for remarkable growth and influence in the years to come.

2025-07-01T19:13:00,"“Not off the table”: Fed comment could trigger Bitcoin, altcoin rally","Bitcoin and altcoin prices could stage a strong rally in July after a surprise statement from Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve Chair. In a statement, Powell changed his tune on when the Fed will start cutting interest rates. For the first time this year, he did not rule out slashing rates as soon as in the July meeting. He said : “I really can’t say. It’s going to depend on the data. And we are going meeting by meeting. I wouldn’t take any meeting off the table or put it directly on the table. It’s going to depend on how the data fall.” In his testimony to Congress last week, Powell insisted that the bank would maintain a wait-and-see approach before hiking interest rates. He and other officials are assessing the impact of Donald Trump’s tariffs on interest rates. You might also like: Senator Lummis pushes for crypto-friendly amendments in Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill Some Federal Reserve officials have supported a July interest rate cut. In recent statements, Christopher Waller and Michele Bowman have insisted that Trump’s tariffs were having a limited impact on inflation and that a July cut would be necessary. Still, traders and the futures market are unconvinced that the Fed will cut in July. Polymarket data pegs a July cut at 17% and no change at 82%. The CME FedWatch tool puts the odds of a cut at just 19.1%. A July rate cut would be highly bullish for Bitcoin ( BTC ) and altcoins because it would reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets. It would also increase risk appetite among investors, as happened during the COVID-19 pandemic when the bank brought rates to zero. The rate cut would also coincide with the passing of Donald Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill, which introduces some tax cuts and reduces regulations. Some of the money saved in taxes will be invested in cryptocurrencies. While a July rate cut is not guaranteed, most analysts anticipate one in September, with odds standing at over 75%. In a statement this week, Goldman Sachs predicted three cuts this year, while Morgan Stanley sees seven in 2026. Bitcoin and altcoins have other catalysts Bitcoin and altcoins have other catalysts that will push them higher this year. For example, Bitcoin demand continues rising, with spot ETF inflows nearing the $50 billion mark. More companies like Coinbase, Block, GameStop, and MetaPlanet continue to accumulate Bitcoin. Additionally, the Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to approve several altcoin ETFs later this year. Odds of an XRP ETF being approved this year have jumped to 85%, while Solana ( SOL ) has soared to 99%. ETF approvals will likely lead to more inflows among investors. Further, regulatory clarity in the crypto industry is happening, which will attract more investors. For example, the US Senate has passed the GENIUS Act , which focuses on the stablecoin industry.

2025-07-01T19:10:45,"Bitcoin: Smarter Web Company’s Strategic BTC Purchase Signals Growing Confidence","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: Smarter Web Company’s Strategic BTC Purchase Signals Growing Confidence In the ever-evolving world of digital assets, major corporate moves often signal shifts in market sentiment and investment trends. Recently, the cryptocurrency community turned its attention to a significant announcement from the UK-based web development firm, The Smarter Web Company (SWC). This move highlights a growing trend among companies embracing digital assets. Let’s delve into the specifics of their latest BTC purchase and what it means for the broader landscape of Bitcoin adoption. Smarter Web Company’s Latest BTC Purchase: A Deep Dive On July 1st, The Smarter Web Company made headlines with its press release confirming an additional acquisition of 230.05 BTC. This latest acquisition was made at an average cost of $107,126 per Bitcoin, demonstrating SWC’s continued belief in the long-term value of the premier cryptocurrency. This strategic addition significantly boosts their overall holdings, bringing SWC’s total Bitcoin stash to an impressive 773.58 BTC. To put this into perspective, here’s a quick look at SWC’s growing Bitcoin portfolio: Transaction BTC Amount Average Cost (USD) Total Holdings (BTC) Previous Holdings (Estimated) N/A N/A 543.53 Latest Purchase (July 1) 230.05 $107,126 N/A New Total Holdings N/A N/A 773.58 This substantial accumulation underscores a deliberate strategy by Smarter Web Company to diversify its treasury assets and potentially hedge against traditional economic uncertainties. It’s not just a one-off transaction; it’s part of a pattern of increasing confidence in digital currencies. Why Are Companies Making Significant Bitcoin Investments? The decision by companies like SWC to allocate a portion of their balance sheets to Bitcoin isn’t arbitrary. It’s often driven by a confluence of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, the search for uncorrelated assets, and the belief in Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value. Here are some key reasons: Inflation Hedge: With global quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, many corporations view Bitcoin as a digital equivalent to gold – a scarce asset that can preserve purchasing power over time. Digital Gold Narrative: Bitcoin’s fixed supply cap of 21 million coins makes it inherently deflationary, appealing to investors looking for assets not subject to traditional monetary policy. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury can offer diversification away from fiat currencies and traditional financial instruments, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Future-Proofing: As the world becomes increasingly digital, embracing cryptocurrencies can be seen as a forward-thinking move, positioning a company at the forefront of financial innovation. These compelling reasons contribute to the growing trend of corporate crypto investment , making headlines and influencing market dynamics. The Growing Trend of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption SWC’s latest acquisition is not an isolated incident but rather a testament to a broader trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption. Companies globally, ranging from tech giants to traditional financial institutions, are increasingly exploring or actively holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets. MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, has been a trailblazer in this space, accumulating tens of thousands of BTC and openly advocating for its adoption as a corporate treasury asset. Tesla, Square (now Block), and various investment funds have also made significant forays into Bitcoin, validating its status as a legitimate asset class. This institutional embrace lends significant credibility to Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency market. It moves Bitcoin beyond being just a speculative retail asset to a recognized component of corporate financial strategy. The increasing liquidity and regulated products surrounding Bitcoin also make it more accessible and appealing for larger entities. Impact of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings on the Market When a company like Smarter Web Company makes a substantial BTC purchase , it sends ripples through the market. Such large-scale acquisitions can: Boost Confidence: They signal to other corporations and retail investors that Bitcoin is a viable and valuable asset, potentially encouraging further investment. Reduce Circulating Supply: By holding Bitcoin off exchanges in corporate treasuries, these purchases effectively reduce the liquid supply available for trading, which can exert upward pressure on prices, especially in a supply-constrained asset like Bitcoin. Enhance Legitimacy: Each corporate adoption step helps normalize Bitcoin, moving it closer to mainstream financial acceptance and potentially paving the way for more favorable regulatory environments. Increase Volatility (Potentially): While generally positive, large corporate movements can also contribute to market volatility, especially if a company decides to sell a significant portion of its holdings. However, most institutional players are focused on long-term holding strategies. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for anyone monitoring the pulse of the crypto market and anticipating future trends in crypto investment . Navigating the Future of Corporate Crypto Investment The decision by Smarter Web Company to further expand its Bitcoin holdings underscores a strategic outlook on digital assets. For companies considering similar moves, careful consideration of market volatility, regulatory landscapes, and long-term objectives is paramount. It’s not just about buying Bitcoin; it’s about integrating a new asset class into a comprehensive financial strategy. Looking ahead, we can anticipate more companies exploring digital assets as part of their treasury management strategies. The continued development of regulatory frameworks, coupled with increasing institutional infrastructure, will likely make it even easier and more appealing for corporations to engage with cryptocurrencies. The narrative around Bitcoin is shifting from a niche technology to a globally recognized, strategically important asset. Conclusion: A Bold Statement in the Digital Age The Smarter Web Company’s latest acquisition of 230.05 BTC, bringing their total to 773.58 BTC, is more than just a financial transaction. It’s a powerful statement of confidence in the future of decentralized finance and the enduring value of Bitcoin . This move aligns SWC with a growing cohort of forward-thinking corporations that are recognizing and acting upon the transformative potential of digital assets. As the digital economy continues to evolve, such strategic investments by established companies like Smarter Web Company will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in shaping the financial landscape of tomorrow.

2025-07-01T19:07:20,"UniCredit Launches Capital-Protected Bet on BlackRock’s $75B Bitcoin ETF – Upside Capped at 85%","Key Takeaways: The product offers full capital protection at maturity, with returns capped at 85% of the ETF’s performance. The offering runs from July 1 to July 28 and is limited to professional clients in Italy. Europe has not approved local spot Bitcoin ETFs; banks are turning to structured products as alternatives. UniCredit will offer a structured investment product tied to BlackRock ’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, according to a report published on July 1. The bank’s five-year certificate is denominated in U.S. dollars and includes full capital protection at maturity. Returns are capped at 85% of the ETF’s performance, and the minimum investment is $25,000, according to a memo reviewed by Bloomberg and confirmed by UniCredit. First Bitcoin ETF Structured Product for Italian Investors Based on the report, the offering is limited to professional clients in Italy and will run from July 1 to July 28. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, approved in the U.S. in January 2024, has since grown to $75 billion in assets. BlackRock also launched a separate Bitcoin exchange-traded product in Europe earlier this year. “We are seeing increasing interest from professional investors in instruments tied to emerging asset classes such as cryptocurrencies,” said Chicco di Stasi, head of Group Investment Product Solutions and Equity & Credit Sales and Trading at UniCredit. “With this product, we offer our professional clients a distinctive solution —the first of its kind in Italy,” said di Stasi.

Intesa Sanpaolo conducted its first spot Bitcoin purchase in January and operates a trading desk. Banco Santander is considering digital asset services for retail clients through its online platform. The UniCredit certificate represents one of the first examples of a major eurozone bank packaging exposure to a U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETF for local clients under structured terms. Its structure, offering capital protection with capped upside, is a cautious approach to client demand for digital asset exposure within a regulated product framework. It also shows how ETF-linked strategies are being adopted by banks to meet growing interest in Bitcoin without direct ownership or wallet infrastructure. European regulators have yet to approve their own spot Bitcoin ETFs. Structured certificates tied to foreign ETFs are emerging as a workaround. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are the implications of offering capital-protected crypto products? Capital protection appeals to risk-averse investors and signals an effort to normalize crypto within traditional finance. It also reflects caution around volatility while still engaging with digital asset demand. How does linking a European product to a U.S. ETF work under regulation? By tying returns to a U.S.-based ETF, banks can structure exposure without relying on unapproved local crypto products. This workaround aligns with current EU restrictions on spot Bitcoin ETFs. What does this mean for broader bank adoption of crypto-linked instruments? It indicates a measured shift. Traditional institutions are more likely to offer wrapped or hybrid products before committing to full-scale crypto offerings, especially in uncertain regulatory environments.

GDLC holds Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano, with BTC and ETH comprising over 91% of the portfolio. The conversion introduces one of the first SEC-approved multi-asset crypto ETFs in the U.S. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved Grayscale Investments’ request to convert its Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) into a spot exchange-traded fund, according to a filing issued on July 1. NEW: There's the approval order for @Grayscale 's $GDLC to convert into an ETF. This is their Digital Large cap fund that holds Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Cardano. Final deadline was tomorrow https://t.co/jSt1HBWD3E pic.twitter.com/9kALeDD2Uh — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) July 1, 2025 The fund, which holds a basket of digital assets including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Cardano, was initially launched in 2018 as a closed-end investment product for accredited investors. Grayscale Expands ETF Lineup According to the holdings data , Bitcoin and Ethereum account for the bulk of the fund’s portfolio, with a combined weight of over 91%. Bitcoin comprises 79.9% and Ethereum 11.3% of the portfolio, while XRP, Solana, and Cardano make up the remaining allocation. The fund’s composition is based on market capitalization and is subject to quarterly rebalancing, reflecting relative shifts in asset size and liquidity. With the conversion, GDLC will become a publicly traded ETF offering broader exposure to multiple crypto assets under a single structure. The SEC’s approval came a day before the final deadline for review. GDLC will join the firm’s existing lineup of converted products, following the approval of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) in January 2025. The ETF structure allows daily share creation and redemption, potentially reducing the premium and discount issues that affected GDLC as a closed-end fund. SEC Greenlights ETF Tracking Bitcoin, Ethereum, and More While spot Bitcoin ETFs have drawn institutional inflows in 2024, multi-asset crypto ETFs remain less common in U.S. markets. Grayscale’s GDLC conversion introduces one of the first regulated products tracking a broader set of digital assets, subject to periodic rebalancing. Grayscale has also stated that any asset subject to enforcement action may be removed from the index during rebalancing. Trading for the converted ETF is expected to begin shortly, pending final operational readiness and exchange coordination. The approval brings attention to how multi-asset crypto funds are built and monitored. Unlike single-token ETFs, these products face questions about asset inclusion, index calculation, and handling of tokens flagged by regulators. With more issuers exploring bundled crypto exposure, regulators and fund managers may need to set clear rules on portfolio structure, rebalancing practices, and disclosure requirements. GDLC’s conversion could mark the start of a broader move toward regulated multi-asset offerings.

2025-07-01T19:00:25,"Bitcoin Price Risks Market Crash After Closing Below Final Weekly Resistance","Crypto analyst Rekt Capital has warned about a potential crash for the Bitcoin price, after the flagship crypto closed below a critical resistance level. The analyst also highlighted the level that BTC needs to reclaim to invalidate this bearish setup. Bitcoin Price Risks Crash With Weekly Close Below Resistance In an X post, Rekt Capital revealed that the Bitcoin price has closed below the final major weekly resistance at around $108,890. Based on this, he remarked that a possible early-stage Lower High resistance may be developing at around $107,720, with BTC at risk of crashing. The analyst added that Bitcoin will need to reclaim $108,890 as support on the daily to invalidate this Lower High. Related Reading: Pundit Warns Bitcoin Is Setting Up Liquidity Traps As It Campaigns For New ATHs In an earlier X post, Rekt Capital highlighted how significant it would have been if the Bitcoin price had closed above this final major weekly resistance. He noted that BTC had never performed such a weekly close. As such, if that had happened last week, he claimed it would not only be “historic” but would enable BTC to enjoy a new uptrend into new all-time highs (ATHs). However, the Bitcoin price now appears to be on a downtrend, having failed to hold above the $107,720 level successfully. BTC had reached an intraday high of $107,970 but has since then been on a decline and is now at risk of losing the $106,800 macro level. Crypto analyst Kevin Capital has warned that BTC being below this level puts it in the danger zone. Meanwhile, based on historical bull market cycles, Rekt Capital has suggested that the Bitcoin price still has some more upside left. In an X post, he stated that history suggests that Bitcoin may end its bull market in two to three months. BTC Still Fuel In The Tank Despite the recent Bitcoin price drop, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto declared that the flagship crypto still has fuel in the tank. He claimed that the weekly market structure remains strong with a series of higher highs and higher lows. The analyst added that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is pushing towards its trendline.

2025-07-01T19:00:00,"SEC eyes single-track crypto ETF listings in quiet talks with exchanges","A little-known SEC consultation could scrap months of bureaucratic delays for crypto ETFs. Instead of dual filings, issuers may soon need just an S-1 and patience, setting the stage for an unprecedented wave of listings. FOX Business reporter Eleanor Terrett has uncovered early discussions between SEC officials and major exchanges about creating standardized listing rules for crypto ETFs. The potential overhaul could fundamentally change how these funds reach the market. Instead of navigating the bureaucratic maze of 19b-4 approvals, issuers might only need to file an S-1 registration and endure a 75-day waiting period. What’s catching industry observers’ attention is what exactly will qualify a token for this fast-track process. While SEC officials remain tight-lipped, multiple sources familiar with the talks suggest the criteria will likely focus on hard metrics like market cap, trading volume, and liquidity thresholds. These requirements could make or break many proposed crypto ETFs before they even reach the starting line. Per Terrett, the securities watchdog declined to comment when pressed for details. 🚨SCOOP: The @SECGov is in the early stages of creating a generic listing standard for token-based ETFs in coordination with exchanges. The thinking, I’m told, is that if a token meets the criteria, issuers could skip the 19b-4 process, file an S-1, wait 75 days, and the… — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) July 1, 2025 You might also like: Bybit launches its MiCA-compliant platform for users in Europe A regulatory shift born of necessity? For an agency often criticized for its incrementalism, the SEC’s apparent willingness to consider a standardized path for token ETF listings marks a rare concession to operational reality. The move follows years of mounting pressure from asset managers, lawmakers, and even courts questioning the agency’s inconsistent treatment of crypto products, causing clogged filing pipelines and extensive back-and-forth with issuers. The current dual-filing system, which requires both an S-1 registration and a 19b-4 exchange rule change, has long been criticized as redundant, often adding months of unnecessary delays. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust’s landmark legal victory last summer, which forced the SEC to reconsider its spot Bitcoin ETF denials, exposed the regulatory arbitrage at play. Now, with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs already trading, the agency appears to be preemptively structuring a clearer path for the next wave of funds, before another courtroom showdown forces its hand. This effort comes as crypto ETFs have evolved from niche products to mainstream contenders, with global assets under management surpassing $90 billion this year. But the SEC’s case-by-case approvals, often mired in repetitive disclosures and last-minute revisions, have struggled to keep pace. The proposed single-track system suggests the agency is acknowledging an unavoidable reality: crypto ETFs are here to stay, and manual vetting of every filing is unsustainable. By offloading initial eligibility checks to exchanges, regulators could focus on systemic risks rather than paperwork. The move mirrors the SEC’s 2020 “ETF Rule” modernization, which simplified traditional ETF launches, but with a critical twist. Unlike conventional funds, crypto ETFs face unique custody, valuation, and market manipulation risks, meaning any new standards will need to address these concerns head-on. If implemented, the changes could trigger a gold rush among mid-tier asset managers previously deterred by the cost and complexity of the 19b-4 process. However, the devil lies in the undisclosed listing criteria.

2025-07-01T18:50:43,"Strategic Bitcoin ETF Acquisition: Sixty Six Capital Boosts Crypto Holdings to 126.8 BTC","BitcoinWorld Strategic Bitcoin ETF Acquisition: Sixty Six Capital Boosts Crypto Holdings to 126.8 BTC In a significant move that underscores the growing institutional appetite for digital assets, Sixty Six Capital , a prominent investment firm listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE), has announced a substantial increase in its Bitcoin holdings. This strategic acquisition highlights the firm’s commitment to expanding its exposure to the burgeoning cryptocurrency market, particularly through regulated investment vehicles like a Bitcoin ETF . If you’ve been watching the crypto space, you know that institutional participation is a key indicator of market maturity, and this latest development from Sixty Six Capital certainly adds another layer to that narrative. What’s Driving Sixty Six Capital’s Bold Bitcoin ETF Strategy? On June 30, Sixty Six Capital revealed in a press release that it had acquired an additional 96,000 units of BTCC.B, a well-known Bitcoin (BTC) Exchange Traded Fund. This latest purchase translates to approximately 13.5 BTC, a notable addition to their portfolio. For those unfamiliar, BTCC.B is an ETF that provides investors with exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This makes it an attractive option for institutional players like Sixty Six Capital, who seek regulated and accessible pathways into the digital asset space. The firm’s decision to deepen its investment in a Bitcoin ETF like BTCC.B isn’t just a random act; it aligns perfectly with their stated focus on crypto and AI assets. This move demonstrates a clear long-term vision, positioning them to capitalize on the potential growth of both sectors. It’s a calculated step that reflects confidence in Bitcoin’s future trajectory and its role within a diversified investment portfolio. How Does This BTC Investment Impact Their Crypto Holdings? This recent acquisition significantly bolsters Sixty Six Capital ‘s overall digital asset exposure. With the addition of 13.5 BTC, the firm’s total BTC investment -equivalent holdings have now surged to an impressive 126.8 BTC. To put this into perspective, this isn’t just a small speculative play; it represents a substantial commitment to Bitcoin as a core asset. The consistent accumulation of Bitcoin, especially through a regulated product, signals a strategic approach to managing their crypto holdings . It suggests that the firm views Bitcoin not merely as a volatile speculative asset, but as a legitimate store of value and a potential hedge against traditional market uncertainties. This growing treasury of Bitcoin could also serve as a foundational asset for future ventures or strategic partnerships within the crypto ecosystem. Why Are Institutional Bitcoin Holdings on the Rise? Sixty Six Capital ‘s move is part of a broader trend of increasing institutional Bitcoin adoption. Investment firms, corporations, and even some sovereign wealth funds are beginning to allocate portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin. Why? Several factors are at play: Accessibility: Bitcoin ETFs like BTCC.B offer a regulated and familiar investment vehicle, removing the complexities of direct crypto custody and management. Inflation Hedge: Many institutions view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation, given its finite supply and decentralized nature. Diversification: Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional assets can offer portfolio diversification benefits. Maturing Market: The cryptocurrency market is becoming more regulated and liquid, making it more palatable for institutional capital. This growing confidence from major players is a crucial indicator for the wider market, often preceding broader retail adoption and infrastructure development. The more institutions enter, the more legitimacy and stability the crypto market gains. The Strategic Play of a Crypto Investment Firm Sixty Six Capital is not just any firm; it’s a crypto investment firm that explicitly targets both crypto and AI assets. This dual focus positions them at the forefront of two of the most transformative technologies of our time. Their latest Bitcoin acquisition is a testament to their belief in the long-term value proposition of digital assets, especially Bitcoin, which is often seen as the foundational layer of the crypto economy. Their strategy appears to be one of consistent accumulation during market opportunities, leveraging regulated products to minimize operational risks. This methodical approach is a stark contrast to the more speculative retail trading often seen in the crypto space, highlighting a sophisticated understanding of market dynamics and long-term value creation. What Challenges and Opportunities Lie Ahead? While the acquisition is positive, the crypto landscape is not without its challenges. Market volatility remains a key concern, and regulatory uncertainty in various jurisdictions can impact sentiment. However, for a firm like Sixty Six Capital , these challenges also present opportunities. Dips can be seen as accumulation opportunities, and clearer regulations could pave the way for even greater institutional inflows. The opportunity lies in being an early mover in a rapidly evolving asset class. By building substantial crypto holdings now, Sixty Six Capital is positioning itself to benefit significantly from future market appreciation and the continued mainstreaming of digital assets. Actionable Insights for Investors What can individual investors learn from Sixty Six Capital ‘s strategic move? Consider Diversification: Explore how digital assets, even a small allocation, might fit into your long-term portfolio strategy. Research Regulated Products: For those uncomfortable with direct crypto ownership, explore Bitcoin ETF s or other regulated investment vehicles available in your region. Long-Term Vision: Institutional moves often reflect a long-term perspective, emphasizing holding over short-term trading. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on institutional adoption trends as they often signal market maturity and future growth areas. A Compelling Future for Institutional Crypto Sixty Six Capital ‘s recent acquisition of 13.5 BTC via the BTCC.B ETF is more than just a transaction; it’s a powerful signal. It underscores the growing confidence among sophisticated investors in Bitcoin as a legitimate and valuable asset class. As a dedicated crypto investment firm , their strategic accumulation of institutional Bitcoin holdings reflects a proactive approach to capturing future growth in the digital economy. This move, increasing their total crypto holdings to 126.8 BTC, reinforces the narrative that digital assets are steadily becoming a staple in modern investment portfolios, moving from the fringes to the mainstream.

In a new interview with CNBC, Ark CEO Cathie Wood shares her outlook on the US economy. “Well, I think we have been climbing a wall of worry. I mean, a lot of people expected tariffs and wars and the controversy between the Fed and the President to really shake markets up. And of course, there has been some volatility. But these are the kinds of bull markets that I think are the most durable, when the market climbs through all of that controversy. It’s really signaling something. And I think the things that it’s signaling are: interest rates probably are coming down. And I think what many people are not focused on in the inflation statistics are the housing numbers. And they get in there with a long lag. We think that the shift, or the concentration toward just a very few stocks– which was a very unhealthy bull market – that is changing, and the market is broadening out. And I think deregulation is probably one of the most important things that this administration is doing to unleash animal spirits.” When asked what she thinks about opposing views – that the economy is doing fine – Wood points to housing and manufacturing numbers before making her prediction that this will all transition smoothly into a recovery. “Well, I think we’ve been pretty consistent on this idea that we’ve been through a rolling recession. If you look at housing, which is actually having a little bit of a relapse today, housing plummeted in 2022 when interest rates shot up, and it has not recovered. Manufacturing has not recovered. And so we do believe that they will recover as interest rates come down, deregulation takes hold, and some certainty about tax cuts and so forth occurs – including immediate expensing, perhaps, of capital goods, which would be very positive. So we think we’ll move from a rolling recession into a recovery.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

What does this mean for the future of crypto investments, and why is the SEC taking its time? What’s the Latest on the Ethereum ETF Staking Proposal? For months, the crypto community has been buzzing with anticipation surrounding the approval of spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds. Following the landmark approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, many believed Ethereum would be next in line. However, the path for Ethereum appears to be fraught with additional complexities, primarily due to its transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and the integrated concept of staking. Bitwise, a prominent asset manager, submitted a unique proposal that sought to incorporate a staking component into its spot Ethereum ETF. This means that, if approved, the ETF would not only hold physical Ethereum but also stake a portion of it to earn yield, potentially passing those returns on to investors. This innovative approach aims to offer a more comprehensive exposure to Ethereum’s ecosystem. The SEC’s latest move, a delay in its decision, indicates a need for more time to thoroughly review the implications of such a structure. Why is the SEC Decision Taking So Long? The SEC’s prolonged deliberation on the Bitwise Ethereum ETF with staking is not entirely unexpected. The agency operates under a mandate to protect investors and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets. When it comes to novel financial products like crypto ETFs, especially those involving staking, the SEC faces several unique challenges and concerns: Investor Protection: The SEC scrutinizes whether investors fully understand the risks associated with staking, including smart contract vulnerabilities, slashing penalties, and the illiquidity of staked assets. Market Manipulation: Concerns persist about the potential for manipulation in the underlying spot markets for cryptocurrencies, even with Ethereum’s significant market capitalization. Custody and Security: Staking introduces additional layers of complexity regarding the custody of assets and the security protocols required to protect staked ETH. Classification of Staking: A fundamental question for the SEC is whether staking rewards or the act of staking itself constitutes a security offering under U.S. law, which would bring it under a different regulatory framework. The approval process for a spot Bitcoin ETF was relatively straightforward in comparison, as Bitcoin operates on a Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism without staking. The transition of Ethereum to PoS adds a new dimension that the SEC must carefully evaluate. Key Differences: Bitcoin vs. Ethereum ETF Approval Process Feature Bitcoin Spot ETF Ethereum Spot ETF (with Staking) Consensus Mechanism Proof-of-Work (PoW) Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Yield Generation No inherent yield generation Staking offers yield Regulatory Complexity Primarily market manipulation concerns Market manipulation, staking classification, custody of staked assets Precedent Grayscale court ruling was pivotal New territory for staking within ETFs Broader Implications for the Crypto ETF Landscape The SEC’s cautious stance extends beyond Ethereum. The simultaneous delay of the 21Shares spot Dogecoin ETF application underscores a broader regulatory hesitancy towards a wider range of digital assets. While Bitcoin’s approval created a precedent, it did not open the floodgates for all cryptocurrencies. Each asset and its unique characteristics, particularly its consensus mechanism and associated activities like staking, are subject to individual scrutiny. This ongoing delay for the Crypto ETF applications could mean a slower, more deliberate rollout of diversified crypto investment products in the U.S. It signals that the SEC is not simply rubber-stamping applications but is taking a measured approach to ensure regulatory clarity and investor protection in a rapidly evolving market. Diving Deeper into the Bitwise Ethereum Proposal Bitwise Asset Management has been a proactive player in the crypto ETF space, being one of the first to file for a spot Bitcoin ETF and now pushing the boundaries with its Ethereum staking proposal. Their strategy is to offer investors not just exposure to the price movements of ETH but also the potential to earn passive income through staking rewards, mirroring the benefits of directly holding and staking Ethereum. The inclusion of staking in an ETF product presents significant operational and regulatory hurdles. How would the staking rewards be managed? What are the tax implications for investors? How would the ETF ensure liquidity for redemptions if a significant portion of its ETH is locked up in staking? These are complex questions that Bitwise and the SEC are likely grappling with during this review period. The success of the Bitwise Ethereum ETF with staking could set a crucial precedent for future yield-bearing crypto products in the traditional finance world. The Complexities of ETH Staking and Regulatory Scrutiny ETH staking is a fundamental aspect of Ethereum’s post-Merge network. It involves locking up ETH to support the network’s security and operations, for which participants earn rewards. While attractive for its passive income potential, integrating staking into a regulated ETF product introduces several layers of complexity: Benefits of Staking for Investors (if integrated into an ETF): Passive Income: Potential to earn yield on ETH holdings, enhancing overall returns. Network Security: Contributing to the stability and security of the Ethereum network. Accessibility: An ETF could make staking accessible to traditional investors without the technical complexities of self-staking. Challenges for ETFs Incorporating Staking: Liquidity: Staked ETH is typically locked for periods, impacting the ETF’s ability to meet redemptions. Slashing Risk: Penalties for validators’ misbehavior could lead to loss of staked ETH. Centralization Concerns: Large institutional stakers could raise concerns about network decentralization. Regulatory Classification: The ongoing debate whether staking rewards constitute unregistered securities. The SEC’s decision will likely hinge on how these challenges are addressed and whether the proposed structure adequately protects investors from the unique risks associated with ETH staking within a regulated product. Market Reaction and Future Outlook The market’s reaction to the latest delay has been relatively muted, as such postponements have become a common occurrence in the crypto ETF approval saga. However, the underlying sentiment remains one of cautious optimism. Analysts generally anticipate that spot Ethereum ETFs will eventually gain approval, though the timeline for those including staking remains highly uncertain. Many experts point to May 2024 as a critical window for a final SEC decision on several spot Ethereum ETF applications, including those from VanEck and Ark Invest/21Shares, though these do not currently include staking. The Bitwise proposal with staking adds another layer of complexity that might require more time. Investors should brace for continued volatility and further delays as the SEC navigates this uncharted regulatory territory. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts While the wait for a spot Ethereum ETF with staking continues, here are some actionable insights for those interested in the crypto market: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on SEC filings and announcements from asset managers. Regulatory developments are key drivers of market sentiment. Understand the Nuances: Differentiate between pure spot ETFs and those with staking components. Each carries different risk profiles and potential benefits. Consider Direct Staking (with caution): For those comfortable with the technical aspects and risks, direct ETH staking remains an option, but understand the implications of locking up your assets. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t place all your investment hopes on a single regulatory approval. The crypto market offers a vast array of opportunities. A Glimpse into Tomorrow: The Evolving Crypto Landscape The SEC’s decision to delay the Bitwise Ethereum ETF staking proposal is a reminder that the integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional finance is a gradual, complex process. While frustrating for some, these delays underscore the regulatory body’s commitment to due diligence in a nascent yet rapidly maturing asset class. The eventual approval of such products, especially those incorporating yield-generating mechanisms like staking, would mark a significant milestone, opening doors for broader institutional and retail adoption. The journey towards fully regulated and innovative crypto investment vehicles continues, characterized by a delicate dance between technological advancement and regulatory prudence. The crypto market remains dynamic, promising both challenges and immense opportunities for those who stay informed and adaptable.

Its mainnet launch signals a new phase in the evolution of Bitcoin’s utility beyond store of value. According to a press release , Botanix Labs has officially launched its Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible Bitcoin ( BTC ) Layer 2 mainnet, backed by a decentralized federation of 16 node operators, including Galaxy, Fireblocks, and Antpool. The network, which processed over 26 million testnet transactions since December 2024, now supports live applications like GMX and Dolomite, with average fees hovering at $0.02. Unlike other Bitcoin L2 solutions that launched under centralized control, Botanix’s “Spiderchain” architecture ensures no single entity, including its own developers, can manipulate user funds. “Too many Bitcoiners have been burned by centralized platforms, which is why Botanix is fully decentralized at launch. No single party, including us, can touch a user’s Bitcoin, and that’s why I’m incredibly excited to see mainnet go live and finally put real tools into the hands of Bitcoiners. If we want a world that runs on Bitcoin, we have to build systems that honor its core principles of self-custody, open participation, and global fault tolerance,” Willem Schroé, CEO and Co-Founder of Botanix Labs, stated.

While other Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions have launched with trade-offs like centralized sequencers, federated bridges, or wrapped assets, Botanix took a different path. The network’s “Spiderchain” architecture, a novel cryptographic primitive, creates a web of multisig wallets that secure the network without relying on a single custodian. Every Bitcoin block triggers a new multisig setup, distributing control across its federation of node operators without resorting to centralized bridges. This structure underpins Botanix’s five-second finality and sub-cent fees while preserving native Bitcoin custody, putting it on par with Ethereum L2s like Arbitrum and Optimism. Already, major DeFi protocols like GMX and Dolomite have deployed on the network, offering Bitcoin-native trading and lending, something previously only possible through risky BTC-pegged tokens on Ethereum. If the network is successful, it could finally unlock Bitcoin’s dormant potential beyond being digital gold. But in a market where even Ethereum struggles with L2 fragmentation, Botanix’s real hurdle won’t be technology. It’ll be proving that Bitcoiners actually want smart contracts. The next few months will reveal whether this is the breakthrough Bitcoin needs or another ambitious solution in search of a problem.

This brings its total Bitcoin holdings to 773.58 BTC. With this amount, the UK-based company is now among the top 40 public firms holding the most Bitcoin. The company aims to grow long-term value and become a major force in digital finance. Smarter Web’s Major Bitcoin Purchase Adds to Its Growing Treasury The company’s newest Bitcoin purchase was completed for £17.97 million, equivalent to $24.6 million. It was revealed that each top coin was purchased for an average price of £78,103, equivalent to approximately $107,126. The Smarter Web Company has spent a total of £60.4 million, equivalent to $82.7 million, on all its crypto purchases to date. On average, each Bitcoin was bought for £78,022, equivalent to $107,015. Although the current market price for the flagship crypto is slightly lower at $106,963, the company remains committed to its Bitcoin treasury policy. Due to its rapid accumulation of Bitcoin, the company now ranks 36th among 135 publicly traded companies that hold the top cryptocurrency worldwide. The firm is nearing the 1,000 BTC mark, a milestone that only a few companies, such as Strategy, have achieved. The Virginia-based firm now holds 597,325 BTC after adding 4,980 more to its stash. Smarter Web Charts a Bold New Path The Smarter Web Company started out offering web design, development, and digital marketing services. It earns revenue through service setup fees, annual hosting plans, and optional monthly support. In 2023, the company began accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment. In April 2025, the Smarter Web Company became a listed firm on the Aquis Stock Exchange through a reverse takeover. It also took a major turn by adopting a Bitcoin treasury policy. This decision aligns with the company’s belief that the top coin will play a major role in the future of global finance. Following the news of its Bitcoin treasury strategy, the firm’s share price jumped by nearly 20,000%, reaching a high of £605. This sharp increase pushed its market value from just £3.7 million, equivalent to approximately $5 million, to over £1 billion, or around $1.4 billion. However, the stock later dropped by almost 70%, then stabilized around £249.75. Leading the UK’s Corporate Bitcoin Movement Though most of the largest corporate Bitcoin holders are U.S.-based, UK firms are starting to follow the same path. The Smarter Web Company currently leads among UK businesses with 773 BTC in its treasury. It stands ahead of Phoenix Digital Assets, Coinsilium, and Jersey-based CoinShares, which have 247 BTC, 74 BTC, and 236 BTC, respectively. This indicates a growing interest in digital assets among British firms, with more businesses expected to follow a similar path.

2025-07-01T18:10:07,"Bitcoin’s Momentum Challenge: Why the Epic BTC Rally Faces Profit-Taking Pressures","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Momentum Challenge: Why the Epic BTC Rally Faces Profit-Taking Pressures The cryptocurrency world has been buzzing with excitement as Bitcoin (BTC) embarked on a remarkable three-month rally, captivating investors and analysts alike. After a challenging period, the king of cryptocurrencies surged an impressive 41% from its April low, pushing its Bitcoin price well above the $107,000 mark. This incredible ascent fueled optimism, leading many to anticipate a continued parabolic rise. However, as with any dynamic market, the tides can turn, and recent signals suggest a potential shift in momentum. Is this merely a pause, or are we witnessing a more significant change in Bitcoin’s trajectory? Understanding the Current Bitcoin Price Action: A Shift in Dynamics? For weeks, the narrative surrounding Bitcoin was one of relentless ascent. Every dip was met with strong buying interest, propelling the Bitcoin price higher and higher. This robust performance cemented its position as a leading indicator for the broader crypto market. Yet, recent observations from prominent analysts, including those at Bitfinex, indicate a subtle but crucial change in market dynamics. The once-unwavering buying pressure appears to be weakening, giving way to an increase in selling activity, particularly from a specific segment of holders. This isn’t necessarily a cause for panic, but rather an invitation for careful consideration. Markets rarely move in a straight line forever. Periods of rapid appreciation are often followed by phases of consolidation or even correction. The current sentiment suggests we might be entering one such phase, where the market digests its recent gains and re-evaluates its direction. Why is the BTC Rally Losing Steam? The Role of Profit-Taking One of the primary drivers behind the perceived loss of momentum in the BTC rally is the noticeable increase in profit-taking . While a healthy part of any market cycle, its intensity and source can offer valuable insights. Analysts point to short-term holders, those who entered the market when Bitcoin was trading below the $80,000 level, as key contributors to this selling pressure. Having witnessed substantial gains, these investors are now cashing out, securing their profits. Consider the following dynamics contributing to this trend: Short-Term Holder Behavior: These investors are typically more reactive to price movements, aiming to capitalize on quick gains. Once their target profit margins are met, they are more likely to sell. Market Psychology: After a significant run-up, there’s a natural inclination for some participants to lock in gains, especially if they anticipate a potential pullback or simply wish to de-risk. Lack of New Catalysts: While the rally was strong, a lack of immediate, powerful new catalysts might lead existing holders to believe the immediate upside is limited, prompting them to sell. This behavior, while understandable from an individual investment perspective, collectively creates selling pressure that can slow or even reverse a rally. The Critical Role of Crypto Market Analysis in Spotting Trends How do experts like those at Bitfinex identify these shifts? It boils down to meticulous crypto market analysis , which involves scrutinizing various on-chain and off-chain metrics. It’s not just about looking at the price chart; it’s about understanding the underlying forces of supply and demand, investor sentiment, and liquidity. Key indicators that signal a potential shift include: Spot Trading Volume: A decline in spot trading volume often suggests reduced conviction among buyers and sellers. When volume drops during an uptrend, it can indicate that fewer new participants are entering the market to sustain the rally. Conversely, a high volume during a price drop can signal strong selling pressure. Taker Buy Pressure: This metric reflects the aggressive buying activity in the market. Taker buys are market orders that immediately execute against existing limit orders. A diminishing taker buy pressure indicates that buyers are becoming less aggressive in their purchases, or there simply aren’t enough new buyers willing to ‘take’ the available sell orders at current prices. Funding Rates and Open Interest: While not explicitly mentioned in the original snippet, these derivatives market metrics are also crucial. Negative or declining funding rates in perpetual futures, coupled with decreasing open interest, can signal a bearish sentiment or reduced speculative interest. By observing these and other metrics, analysts can paint a clearer picture of the market’s health and anticipate potential turning points, helping investors make more informed decisions. Navigating Increased Profit-Taking: What Does it Mean for Investors? The rise in profit-taking , particularly from short-term holders, is a natural part of the market cycle. It suggests that a significant portion of the recent gains has been realized. For investors, this means the market might be entering a phase of consolidation. What does consolidation entail? Consolidation is a period where the asset’s price trades within a relatively narrow range, often after a significant upward or downward move. It’s a time for the market to ‘catch its breath,’ absorb new information, and for supply and demand to find a new equilibrium. This can be a healthy development for long-term sustainability, as it helps to shake out weaker hands and build a stronger foundation for future growth. During consolidation, investors might observe: Reduced volatility compared to the preceding rally. Price bouncing between clear support and resistance levels. A period of uncertainty, as the market awaits new catalysts or a clear breakout direction. For those looking to enter the market or add to their positions, a consolidation phase can present opportunities to buy at more stable price points, rather than chasing a rapidly rising asset. What Declining Trading Volume Tells Us About Market Health The decline in trading volume is a significant indicator that should not be overlooked. Volume is often considered the ‘fuel’ of price movements. A strong rally typically sees increasing volume, indicating broad participation and conviction. When volume starts to wane during an uptrend, it suggests that fewer participants are willing to buy at higher prices, and the existing rally is being sustained by a smaller pool of committed buyers. Here’s a simple analogy: Imagine a car climbing a hill. If the engine starts to sputter and consume less fuel, it’s a sign that the ascent might be slowing down or even reversing. Similarly, declining volume in an uptrend can signal that the underlying buying power is diminishing. This makes the price action less reliable and more susceptible to sudden reversals or corrections. Conversely, if a price drop occurs on high volume, it signals strong selling conviction. If a price drop occurs on low volume, it might indicate a temporary pullback rather than a strong bearish reversal. In the current scenario, the declining volume accompanying the weakening rally suggests a decrease in overall market participation and enthusiasm at these higher price levels. Actionable Insights for Investors in a Shifting Market So, what should investors do when the BTC rally shows signs of fatigue and profit-taking becomes prevalent? Here are some actionable insights: Re-evaluate Your Strategy: If you’re a short-term trader, this might be a time to consider securing some profits or adjusting stop-loss orders. For long-term holders (HODLers), consolidation can be a test of conviction, but also an opportunity to accumulate more Bitcoin if you believe in its long-term potential. Focus on Key Support Levels: Identify crucial price levels where strong buying interest has historically emerged. These can act as potential floors if the price continues to decline. For example, the $80,000 level, where many short-term holders bought in, could become a significant psychological and technical support level if the market pulls back further. Diversify (Carefully): While Bitcoin remains dominant, consider if your portfolio is overly concentrated. However, avoid panic-selling into other assets without thorough research. Stay Informed: Continue to follow reliable crypto market analysis from reputable sources. Understanding macro-economic trends, regulatory news, and on-chain data will be crucial. Practice Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Use stop-loss orders, manage your position sizes, and have a clear exit strategy. Patience is Key: Markets move in cycles. A consolidation phase can be frustrating, but it’s a natural part of healthy growth. Impulsive decisions often lead to losses. The Road Ahead: Consolidation or Correction? The current signals suggest that Bitcoin is likely entering a consolidation phase rather than immediately resuming its sharp upward trajectory. This period of sideways movement can be beneficial, allowing the market to build a stronger base before its next significant move. However, there’s always the possibility that increased profit-taking and sustained low trading volume could lead to a deeper correction. The key will be to watch how demand responds at critical support levels. If buying interest returns strongly at these levels, it could confirm a healthy consolidation. If these levels break, it might signal a more pronounced pullback. Ultimately, the market is a complex interplay of human psychology, economic factors, and technological developments. Conclusion: Navigating Bitcoin’s Evolving Landscape Bitcoin’s recent rally has been nothing short of spectacular, but the emerging signs of weakening momentum and rising profit-taking warrant attention. As trading volume declines and buyer enthusiasm wanes, the market appears to be transitioning into a consolidation phase. This shift, highlighted by astute crypto market analysis , is a natural part of market cycles, offering a chance for the Bitcoin price to stabilize and gather strength for its next move. For investors, understanding these dynamics and adopting a patient, informed approach will be crucial to navigating the evolving landscape of the BTC rally . While the immediate future might involve less dramatic upward movements, the long-term narrative for Bitcoin remains compelling for many, predicated on its fundamental strengths and growing adoption.

In a new report, Bitwise executives Matt Hougan and Ryan Rasmussen double down on their prediction that Bitcoin will hit $200,000 within six months, a more than 88% increase from its current value. “It’s been a mixed year for crypto asset prices… We’re optimistic, however, that things are setting up for a very strong H2 (second half of the year). Progress in D.C. around crypto legislation, rising demand from institutional investors for crypto exposure and extreme bullishness around stablecoins are combining to create a strong environment for gains. The bottom line: we’re holding firm to our BTC $200,000 prediction, as there is simply too much institutional demand for BTC to keep prices flat for long.” The investors also say that there are bullish catalysts that may spark explosive rallies for Ethereum ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ) in the second half of 2025. However, they are unsure if ETH and SOL can hit fresh all-time highs. “We’re less confident on ETH and SOL, but hope that rising interest in stablecoins, ETF (exchange-traded fund) approvals and the emergence of ETH and SOL treasury companies can drive prices substantially higher.” Bitcoin is trading for $105,996 at time of writing, down 1.5% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, ETH is trading for $2,423 at time of writing, down 2% on the day, and SOL is trading $147 at time of writing, down 6.8% in the last 24 hours. The analysts also believe that top US crypto exchange Coinbase will eventually trade for $700 per share and surpass Charles Schwab’s total value, but that it’s unlikely to occur this year. “COIN’s stock has done well, doubling Schwab’s market return (44% against 22% for the old-school brokerage)… Schwab’s stock has done a bit better than we expected. As a result, the gap between Coinbase’s value ($90 billion) and Schwab’s value ($164 billion) is probably too wide to cross by year-end.” COIN is trading for $337 at time of writing. Lastly, the executives are also staying committed to their prediction that the market cap of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) will surpass $50 billion this year. “Tokenized RWAs were a $13 billion market at the start of 2025. Today, they’re at roughly $25 billion.

2025-07-01T18:00:12,"Bitcoin Network Volume Echoes Mid-2021 ‘Stable Equilibrium’ – Is A Big Move Brewing?","After rebounding from a local bottom of around $75,000 in April, Bitcoin (BTC) appears to be stuck in the $100,000 to $110,000 range, showing little indication of a clear directional trend. One key data point reflecting this indecision is Bitcoin’s network volume. Bitcoin Network Volume Stuck In Balance Zone According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor AxelAdlerJr, Bitcoin’s network volume has stabilized in a state of ‘stable equilibrium,’ reminiscent of the mid-2021 consolidation phase that preceded a major move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Binary CDD Hints At Healthy Consolidation, Not A Top For the uninitiated, Bitcoin network volume refers to the total value of BTC transferred across the blockchain over a specific period, typically used to gauge market activity and capital flow. Higher network volume suggests increased investor engagement and liquidity, while lower volume may indicate reduced interest or market stagnation. Notably, when BTC reached the upper end of its current range – around $110,000 – its average network volume surged to as high as $67 billion. Since then, the metric has slightly declined and now hovers around $58.7 billion. Since January 2024, Bitcoin’s average network volume has ranged between $40 billion and $80 billion. According to the CryptoQuant analyst, this corridor has become a key indicator of network activity balance and broader market sentiment. Historically, when the Bitcoin average volume approached the upper-end of the range at $80 billion, it coincided with local price peaks of $70,000 and $100,000. On the contrary, moves toward the lower-end – around $40 billion – were associated with short-term pullbacks, though these dips were often quickly bought up by market participants. Currently, the $58.7 billion reading sits near the midpoint of this range, mirroring the consolidation phase observed in mid-2021. The analyst explained: As long as the indicator remains above the $40 billion level, we can speak of a stable fundamental market condition. Rising volumes above the $80 billion mark will confirm strengthening activity and fresh capital inflow. On the other hand, a sustained drop below $40 billion will indicate weakening network demand and may be a harbinger of a deeper correction. Is BTC Preparing For A Big Move? While Bitcoin network volume suggests the market is in a state of equilibrium, some on-chain metrics hint at a potential breakout building in the background – possibly paving the way for renewed bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Poised For Rally As Geopolitical Tensions Ease And Inflation Expectations Fall For example, the BTC short-term holder floor has been rising steadily in recent months, currently hovering around $98,000. This provides a strong support base, potentially preventing a sharp downside correction. However, selling pressure from miners and long-term holders is also beginning to increase – casting some uncertainty over BTC’s short-term price trajectory. At press time, BTC trades at $106,528, down 0.9% in the past 24 hours.
