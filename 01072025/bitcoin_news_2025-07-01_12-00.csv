2025-07-01T09:34:42,"Bit Digital Makes A Massive Bet On Ethereum","Summary In June 2024, I rated Bit Digital a 'strong buy' due to its early and successful pivot to HPC revenue. Missed HPC revenue guidance, and shifting GPU market dynamics, made me less optimistic about long-term prospects later last year. A recent 75 million share offering and questionable capital allocation strategy further cloud the investment outlook, making me cautious on BTBT now. The company wants to spin out its HPC/AI subsidiary WhiteFiber via IPO. I believe shareholders would benefit from such a move. Bit Digital ( BTBT ) is one of the stocks I've covered the most for Seeking Alpha in recent years. It's also one of the few stocks that I have labeled with a 'strong buy' tag in the past. That strong buy call came last June and was predicated on the assumption that Bit Digital was a strong buyout candidate in a market that was seeing Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining stocks shift operations to HPC businesses. Bit Digital was one of the first companies to do this and to date is still one of the most successful examples of such a pivot. BTBT Calls (Seeking Alpha) More recently, I've soured a bit on the company's long-term prospects after annualized HPC revenue guidance was missed last year, market dynamics for GPU as-a-service models began to change , and Bit Digital embarked on a capital allocation strategy that I found to be questionable in my most recent piece from March. Subsequent to my March piece, we have another quarter of corporate performance and a recent capital raise to assess. Q1-25 Earnings The quarter ended-March was a fairly transformative one for Bit Digital. Not only did the company see a significant 17.4% reduction in top line revenue year over year, but the company's revenue from its Digital Asset Mining segment plummeted by 64.5% from Q1-24: Revenue Q1-25 Q1-24 YoY Digital Asset Mining $7,776,963 $21,891,760 -64.5% Cloud Services $14,842,286 $8,069,584 83.9% Colocation Services $1,644,663 $0 ETH Staking $560,641 $325,746 72.1% Other $280,567 $99,748 181.3% Total Revenue $25,105,120 $30,386,838 -17.4% Source: Bit Digital, Form 10-Q In spite of 84% year-over-year growth in revenue from Cloud Services, Bit Digital simply couldn't overcome the decline from mining to produce a positive year-over-year gain in the top line figure. For context, mining made up just 31% of Bit Digital's total revenue in Q1-25. That segment accounted for 72% of revenue in Q1-24 and 54% during the full year 2024. The decline in revenue from mining has been well telegraphed for several months. The company even stopped releasing monthly production numbers early in the year. Profit Margin Q1-25 Q1-24 YoY Digital Asset Mining 21.3% 40.7% -47.8% Cloud Services 59.0% 60.9% -3.1% Colocation Services 66.8% ETH Staking 94.2% 95.0% -0.8% Source: Bit Digital, Form 10-Q It certainly isn't a surprise to see the margin from mining collapse by 48% year over year. Q1-24 was the last full quarter of pre-halving Bitcoin production. CEO Sam Tabar has steadfastly opposed a hash-growth at any cost philosophy, and I think the transformation we're currently seeing in the company's business is proof of that. Still, there are concerns going forward. For instance, despite producing 59% gross margins in Q1-25, Bit Digital's Cloud Service revenue is still well below the $100 million annualized run rate that was expected by the end of last year. Operating income Q1-25 Q1-24 Total Revenue $25,105,120 $30,386,838 Opex Sans Digital Asset Gain/Loss -$28,268,205 -$28,960,381 Operating Income -$3,163,085 $1,426,457 Source: Bit Digital, Form 10-Q - Author's calculation Essentially, every public Bitcoin miner utilizes FASB accounting rules that allow the companies to show unrealized gains in the digital assets that they hold as income (or losses). Stripping that out from Bit Digital's report, we can see that the company flipped from positive operating income in Q1-24 to negative in Q1-25. This should be alleviated in the future as Bitcoin mining becomes a less significant driver of both COGS and revenue. That said, the company's recent capital allocation moves have been substantial. A Massive Wager On Ethereum Prior to releasing Q1 earnings, we already knew that Bit Digital was beginning to position as more of an Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) proxy than a Bitcoin proxy. The company held $91.3 million in ETH and $78.8 million in BTC at the end of January. Two months later, those figures were dramatically different: Digital Assets Quantity Cost Basis Fair Value BTC 417.6 $25,456,846 $34,474,294 ETH 24,434.20 $59,917,193 $44,556,466 Total digital assets held as of March 31, 2025 $85,374,039 $79,030,760 Source: Bit Digital, Form 10-Q At the end of January, ETH had a market value of $3,300 per coin. By the end of March, that price had been nearly cut in half, down to $1,800 per coin. This is what I said at the end of my March BTBT piece: This may be a spicy take, but if I were CEO Sam Tabar, I would completely abandon the ETH staking business entirely. There are two reasons for this. First, ETH has been a total drag on the company's digital asset value and I laid that out in the section above. That could certainly turn around, but that's far from a sure thing. The bigger issue is really simple; if Bit Digital can't rely on capital appreciation from ETH the way it can from BTC, then it would almost certainly be more beneficial for the company to deploy that capital differently. Last summer, the company had sold BTC and swapped it to ETH - that turned out to be a horrific decision with the benefit of hindsight. During Q1-25, the company sold even more BTC and hung on to its ETH. CEO Sam Tabar from the conference call: we also sold approximately $32 million worth of Bitcoin holdings during the quarter to help fund growth while managing our use of equity issuance . We did not sell any ETH during the quarter, but transferred 3,400 into an internally managed fund, which we do not count as treasury holdings. I've bolded part of the quote above because I think this is important. Leadership has openly acknowledged the poor optics associated with the size of the company's ATM relative to the market capitalization of BTBT stock. Given this, I find it strange that Bit Digital opted to raise capital through shareholder dilution to buy even more ETH. Capital Allocation & WhiteFiber IPO On June 26th, Bit Digital announced the pricing of $150 million equity raise at $2 per share for 75 million new shares of BTBT stock. Notably, the company's stock had closed at $2.35 per share the prior session. Thus, the offering came at a 15% discount to the market value of the stock just one day earlier. After underwriter fees, the company receives $142.5 million, with use of proceeds going toward purchasing ETH. It's hard for me to view this favorably for three reasons. Bit Digital just sold Digital Assets to fund growth rather than issuing equity, only to turn around just a couple months later and issue equity to buy Digital Assets. It's a rather striking 180. While the company's ETH staking is its best business segment by gross margin, the revenue from the segment is by far the smallest of four dis-aggregated business lines. Furthermore, the staking business may not be intense from an opex standpoint, but it does tie up a considerable amount of capital for a very small percentage of top line revenue. This move essentially triples down on a capital allocation strategy that hasn't been working. Namely, allowing Bit Digital's equity valuation to be dependent on a risk asset that has weak sentiment and arguably deteriorating fundamentals. All while the company wants to raise through an active ATM. In the prospectus, Bit Digital expressed conviction in the Ethereum ecosystem and specifically mentioned legislation around stablecoins in the US as cause for optimism: Given increased regulatory clarity, including the recently passed GENIUS Act, we view ETH as a digitally native store of value and foundational infrastructure for decentralized applications and stablecoins. Accordingly, we intend to grow our ETH position over time, supported by staking rewards. Looking past the fact that the GENIUS Act has actually not been passed yet by the House of Representatives, I see it as a risky move to further tie the valuation of the company to an asset that Bit Digital can't ultimately control rather than focusing on raising that capital to fund growth of WhiteFiber. On the latter, it's very interesting to me that Bit Digital is trying to spin out WhiteFiber. As a wholly owned subsidiary of Bit Digital, WhiteFiber submitted a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a proposed IPO. Share count and pricing of such an IPO have yet to be determined. But this would seem to be an attempt to get the same kind of value on its data center business that the market is currently giving companies like Core Scientific ( CORZ ) or IREN Limited ( IREN ) - each of which actually had less HPC/AI revenue than Bit Digital in Q1 yet continue to trade a much larger forward sales multiples than that of BTBT: Data by YCharts To some degree, I suspect the lack of apparent HPC respect for BTBT relative to peers is due to the company having such a large allocation to ETH. For those who would rather see Bit Digital focus capital on scaling cloud services, these ETH purchases are perhaps frustrating. But in the event WhiteFiber does IPO and is successfully spun out of BTBT, holding BTBT is perhaps warranted. Valuation And Assets Per the offering prospectus, there would be an estimated 283.5 million BTBT common shares outstanding following completion of the offering. By my math, that dilutes the current holder base by roughly 36%. And at a $2.19 share close on June 30th, Bit Digital has an implied valuation of $621 million at that 283.5 million shares count. Following the $150 million capital raise, Bit Digital will have about $204 million in ETH, $45 million in BTC, $297 million in non-current assets, and $99 million in combined cash and 'other current assets' as of Q1-25. Short of an absolute collapse in the price of Ethereum, stock price downside from here should be somewhat limited, provided the company doesn't continue to aggressively dilute. Closing Summary I think a WhiteFiber IPO would be a good thing for both Bit Digital and Bit Digital shareholders. It will allow the market to pick between two very different business models currently operated by one parent company. Given the substantial rallies we've seen from stocks like CoreWeave, Core Scientific, and IREN Limited on the proposed buyout of Core Scientific by CoreWeave, there's no reason Bit Digital shouldn't benefit from spinning out its HPC/AI subsidiary - especially given the segment revenue its doing relative to some of those other stocks mentioned. Having said all of this, I'm a bit concerned about Bit Digital's Ethereum reliance. Despite being well off its coin price highs, Ethereum is far from cheap on a circulating P/F ratio. A re-rating lower in ETH would severely impact Bit Digital's stock valuation. I'll reiterate the 'hold.'",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4798514-bit-digital-makes-massive-bet-ethereum?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BUSINESS|ETH|BTC|MINING|MARKET","ETH-USD|BTBT",cryptocompare
2025-07-01T09:34:02,"Mystery Wallet Sends $20K to Satoshi Nakamoto’s Address – Accident or Tribute?","An unknown wallet has sent $20,000 worth of Bitcoin to Satoshi Nakamoto’s legendary Genesis Block mining address, marking the largest transfer to the Bitcoin creator’s wallet in four months. Arkham Intelligence detected the transaction on June 30, involving 0.185 BTC sent to the address that holds approximately $117 billion in dormant Bitcoin. The transfer represents the second-largest donation to Satoshi’s address since February, when another user sent $200,000 following a Binance withdrawal. Arkham analysts suspect the latest transaction was either an accidental exchange withdrawal or a deliberate tribute from “ an OG Bitcoiner giving back ” to honor Bitcoin’s enigmatic founder. Source: Arkham Intelligence Historical data reveals a pattern of periodic donations to Satoshi’s addresses, with transfers ranging from $7,140 to $1.17 million over recent years. Most large transfers appear to be connected to exchange withdrawals, suggesting possible user errors rather than intentional gifts, although the motivations behind these transactions remain unclear. Satoshi’s wallet now contains the equivalent of $117 billion in Bitcoin across multiple addresses, all of which have remained untouched since the creator’s disappearance in 2011. Source: Arkham Intelligence Any movement from these addresses would likely trigger massive market volatility and intense global attention. Exchange Withdrawals Drive Mysterious Donation Pattern The latest $20,000 transfer follows a documented pattern of substantial Bitcoin donations to Satoshi Nakamoto’s addresses, with most large transactions appearing linked to cryptocurrency exchange operations. Arkham’s analysis suggests the recent transfer likely originated from an exchange or crypto service withdrawal, consistent with previous high-value donations. February’s $200,000 transfer originated from a personal wallet after the sender withdrew funds from Binance. Source: Arkham Intelligence The pattern suggests either systematic user errors during withdrawal processes or deliberate tribute payments by early Bitcoin adopters, despite Nakamoto’s 14-year absence from public communications. Historical transfer data shows significant variations in donation amounts and timing. A $1.17 million transfer occurred one year ago from address bc1***6v2, representing the largest single donation on record. This was followed by smaller amounts, including $67,790 two years ago and $41,670 three years ago. Early Bitcoin era miners have significantly reduced their selling activity, with 2025 sales dropping to just 150 BTC compared to 10,000 BTC sold in the previous year. Some analysts interpret these donations as a sign of community support for the Satoshi-era miners who helped establish Bitcoin’s initial network security. Identity Speculation Intensifies Amid Legal Battles The mystery surrounding Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity has intensified dramatically as multiple investigations, documentaries, and legal proceedings attempt to uncover the identity of Bitcoin’s creator. Recent speculation has centered on Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey , with researchers citing circumstantial evidence, including timing coincidences and connections to the cypherpunk movement. Sean Murray’s research highlighted alleged connections between Dorsey and Nakamoto, including shared interests in cryptography and references to sailors in early Bitcoin code. VanEck’s Matthew Sigel described the evidence as “ compelling and worthy of further scrutiny ,” although critics dismissed the claims as speculative without concrete proof. In the spirit of full disclosure, intellectual honesty, posterity's judgment, and rigorous debate, I would like to share my strong belief: I have become personally convinced that Jack Dorsey – CEO of Square and founder of X – is Bitcoin’s founder Satoshi Nakamoto. This is my… https://t.co/ufLhdoZEzw pic.twitter.com/kY5y3fFpby — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) February 18, 2025 At the same time, Craig Wright’s fraudulent claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto reached a definitive conclusion with his conviction for contempt of court. Judge James Mellor sentenced Wright to one year in prison , suspended for two years, after finding “overwhelming” evidence he is not Bitcoin’s creator. Legal pressure on government agencies has also escalated, with crypto lawyer James Murphy filing Freedom of Information Act lawsuits against the Department of Homeland Security. Murphy seeks documents related to claims that DHS identified and interviewed Satoshi Nakamoto in California, though the agency has never confirmed these allegations. Most interestingly, HBO filmmaker Cullen Hoback’s documentary named Canadian Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd as the creator of Bitcoin, prompting Todd to go into hiding for safety reasons. However, despite all the exciting efforts to identify Bitcoin’s creator, it has sparked controversy within the cryptocurrency community, with many questioning the ethics of attempting to expose Satoshi’s identity. HBO's documentary Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery has stirred controversy by suggesting that early Bitcoin developer @peterktodd is Satoshi Nakamoto, a claim Todd swiftly denied on social media. #SatoshiNakamoto #Bitcoin #MoneyElectric https://t.co/m7EThxd1he — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 9, 2024 Multiple attempts to identify Bitcoin’s creator have focused on prominent cypherpunks, including Nick Szabo, Hal Finney, and Len Sassaman.

2025-07-01T09:30:17,"AI Regulation: Congress’s Alarming Push to Block State AI Laws for Five Years","BitcoinWorld AI Regulation: Congress’s Alarming Push to Block State AI Laws for Five Years In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, where decentralized technologies like cryptocurrency thrive on innovation, a significant debate is unfolding in Washington that could reshape the future of artificial intelligence. Congress is currently deliberating a federal proposal to impose an AI moratorium , potentially banning states and local governments from regulating AI for five years. This move, reminiscent of debates around digital asset regulation, has sparked intense discussion among tech leaders, policymakers, and consumer advocates alike. The Proposed AI Moratorium : What’s on the Table? A federal proposal that would prohibit states and local governments from regulating AI for half a decade could soon become law. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) and other lawmakers are working to include this provision in a major GOP budget bill, which the Senate is voting on this Monday, ahead of a critical July 4 deadline. This measure, initially conceived to ban states from enforcing any laws or regulations on AI models, systems, or automated decision systems for a decade, has seen revisions. Over the weekend, Senator Cruz and Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) agreed to shorten the pause on state-based AI regulation to five years. The updated language attempts to exempt laws addressing child sexual abuse materials, children’s online safety, and an individual’s rights to their name, likeness, voice, and image. However, a crucial caveat states that such laws must not place an “undue or disproportionate burden” on AI systems. Legal experts are uncertain how this would impact existing or future state AI laws , creating a cloud of ambiguity over their enforceability. Fueling AI Innovation or Stifling Progress? Proponents of the federal AI moratorium, including prominent figures like OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Anduril’s Palmer Luckey, and a16z’s Marc Andreessen, argue that a fragmented approach to AI regulation across states would hinder American AI innovation . They contend that a “patchwork” of diverse state laws would make it excessively difficult for AI companies to operate and scale, especially at a time when the global race to dominate AI, particularly against China, is intensifying. The argument is that a unified federal approach, even if it means a temporary pause on state action, would provide the necessary clarity and freedom for AI developers to innovate rapidly without navigating a labyrinth of differing local rules. This perspective emphasizes speed and competitiveness on the international stage as paramount. Safeguarding Consumer Protection : The Case Against Federal Preemption Critics of the proposed moratorium argue that it would severely undermine consumer protection and accountability in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. This group includes most Democrats, many Republicans, Anthropic’s CEO Dario Amodei, labor groups, AI safety nonprofits, and consumer rights advocates. They warn that this provision would block states from passing vital laws designed to protect citizens from AI harms, effectively allowing powerful AI firms to operate with minimal oversight. The moratorium threatens to preempt state AI laws that have already been enacted. For example, California’s AB 2013 requires companies to disclose the data used to train AI systems, offering transparency to consumers. Similarly, Tennessee’s ELVIS Act protects musicians and creators from AI-generated impersonations, a direct response to emerging AI harms. Public Citizen has compiled a database revealing numerous AI-related laws across states that could be nullified, many of which address specific harms like deceptive AI-generated media used to influence elections, a concern shared by states like Alabama, Arizona, California, Delaware, Hawaii, Indiana, Montana, and Texas. Furthermore, several noteworthy AI safety bills awaiting signature, such as New York’s RAISE Act, which would mandate large AI labs nationwide to publish thorough safety reports, are also at risk. Opponents argue that allowing a federal vacuum in regulation for five years leaves consumers vulnerable to unchecked AI development. The Fiscal Leverage: How Funding Ties Into State AI Laws Getting the AI moratorium into a budget bill has required some creative legislative maneuvering. Budget bill provisions typically need a direct fiscal impact. To meet this requirement, Senator Cruz revised the proposal in June to make compliance with the AI moratorium a condition for states to receive funds from the $42 billion Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD) program. This strategic move leverages federal funding as an incentive for states to adhere to the federal AI pause. Cruz released another revision last week, claiming it ties the requirement only to a new $500 million in BEAD funding included in the bill—a separate, additional pot of money. However, a closer examination of the revised text suggests the language also threatens to pull already obligated broadband funding from states that do not comply. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) previously criticized Cruz’s original language, stating it “forces states receiving BEAD funding to choose between expanding broadband or protecting consumers from AI harms for ten years.” This fiscal pressure adds another layer of complexity to the debate. What’s Next for AI Regulation in Congress? As of Monday, the Senate is engaged in a “vote-a-rama”—a series of rapid votes on the budget bill’s numerous amendments. The new language agreed upon by Cruz and Blackburn will be part of a broader amendment that Republicans are expected to pass along party lines. Senators will also likely vote on a Democrat-backed amendment aimed at stripping the entire AI moratorium section from the bill. The outcome of these votes will determine the immediate future of AI regulation in the U.S. The debate extends beyond Capitol Hill. Chris Lehane, chief global affairs officer at OpenAI, stated that the “current patchwork approach to regulating AI isn’t working and will continue to worsen if we stay on this path.” He warned of “serious implications” for the U.S. in the AI dominance race against China, even quoting Vladimir Putin on the importance of AI leadership. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman echoed these sentiments, expressing concern that a state-by-state patchwork would be “a real mess and very difficult to offer services under.” Altman also questioned whether policymakers could keep pace with rapidly evolving AI technology to craft effective regulations. The Public’s Stance on Consumer Protection While proponents of the moratorium advocate for a “light touch” approach to AI governance, public sentiment appears to lean differently. A recent Pew Research survey found that most Americans desire more AI regulation . Approximately 60% of U.S. adults and 56% of AI experts are more concerned that the U.S. government won’t go far enough in regulating AI than they are about over-regulation. Americans also largely lack confidence in the government’s ability to regulate AI effectively and remain skeptical of industry efforts around responsible AI. This public desire for stronger oversight stands in contrast to the proposed federal pause on state action. The Case Against Preemption: Why States Matter “The patchwork argument is something that we have heard since the beginning of consumer advocacy time,” Emily Peterson-Cassin, corporate power director at internet activist group Demand Progress, told Bitcoin World. “But the fact is that companies comply with different state regulations all the time. The most powerful companies in the world? Yes. Yes, you can.” This counter-argument suggests that large tech companies are well-equipped to navigate varying state laws, as they do in other industries. Opponents and cynics argue that the AI moratorium is less about fostering innovation and more about sidestepping oversight. While many states have passed AI regulations, Congress, known for its slow pace, has yet to pass any comprehensive federal AI laws. “If the federal government wants to pass strong AI safety legislation, and then preempt the states’ ability to do that, I’d be the first to be very excited about that,” said Nathan Calvin, VP of state affairs at the nonprofit Encode. “Instead, [the AI moratorium] takes away all leverage, and any ability, to force AI companies to come to the negotiating table.” Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, a vocal critic, stated in an opinion piece for The New York Times that “a 10-year moratorium is far too blunt an instrument.” He emphasized AI’s rapid advancement, predicting fundamental changes within two years. Amodei argued that without a clear federal plan, a moratorium would result in the worst outcome: no state action and no national policy. He suggested that instead of prescribing product release methods, the government should collaborate with AI companies to establish transparency standards for practices and model capabilities. The opposition isn’t limited to Democrats. Republicans like Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) are concerned about states’ rights and are working with Democrats to remove the provision. Senator Blackburn, despite her involvement in the amendment, has also criticized the provision, advocating for states’ ability to protect citizens and creative industries. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) even threatened to oppose the entire budget if the moratorium remains. A Critical Juncture for AI Governance The debate over the federal AI moratorium represents a critical juncture for AI governance in the United States. It pits the desire for rapid AI innovation and global competitiveness against the fundamental need for consumer protection and robust oversight. The outcome of the Senate’s vote-a-rama will not only shape the regulatory landscape for artificial intelligence for the next five years but also set a precedent for how federal and state governments interact in regulating rapidly evolving technologies. As the digital world continues its relentless march forward, finding a balanced approach that fosters innovation while safeguarding the public remains the paramount challenge.

XRP & Ethereum Funding Rates Have Turned Sharply Positive In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed about how the top cryptocurrencies by market cap currently compare in terms of the Funding Rate . The Funding Rate refers to an indicator that keeps track of the amount of periodic fees that the investors on the perpetual futures market are paying each other on the various centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric is positive, it means the long investors are paying a premium to the short ones in order to hold onto their positions. Such a trend suggests the presence of a bullish bias in the derivatives market. On the other hand, the indicator being under the zero mark implies the short positions outweigh the long ones and a bearish sentiment is shared by the majority of the traders. Now, here is the table shared by Glassnode that shows the current Funding Rate for the major assets in the sector: As is visible above, all of these assets except for one have their Funding Rate above the 0% level. For many, however, the metric still has only a small value, meaning that the sentiment tends more or less neutral. Among the coins with a long bias, XRP and Ethereum particularly stand out, with the metric sitting at 0.093% and 0.083%, respectively. For comparison, the coin with the third highest Funding Rate, Tron (TRX), stands at 0.0052%. The change to this highly positive sentiment has come for the two coins as on-chain metrics have been giving indefinite signals. The Supply in Profit is at 79.5% for XRP and 64.7% for ETH. This means while the majority of the supply is in the green, the distribution isn’t as extreme as for Bitcoin (98.4%) or Tron (96.6%). Both of the cryptocurrencies have noted a decline in Daily Active Addresses , which measures the daily number of addresses taking part in transfer activity on the network. The metric is down 11.4% for ETH and 34.3% for XRP. While active users themselves have become fewer, it would appear that those who are left have ramped up activity, as the On-Chain Volume is up by 74.5% for the former and 637.3% for the latter. Despite the mixed conditions, futures market users are putting on bullish bets. “This signals growing demand for long exposure, even as on-chain activity and sentiment remain mixed,” notes the analytics firm. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $2.21, up almost 9% in the last week.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-eth-greedy-funding-rates-highest-top-coins/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","XRP|ETH|Ethereum|Ethereum Funding Rates|XRP Funding Rates|XRPUSDT",cryptocompare
2025-07-01T09:30:00,"Analysts Give 95% Chance for Solana, XRP & LTC ETF Approval","This optimistic outlook is a jump from the previous 90% estimate and means that there is growing confidence in the broader acceptance of crypto investment products. In addition to these altcoins, a basket ETF composed of multiple crypto assets is also expected to be approved soon. Meanwhile, the US is set to launch its first-ever staked crypto ETF—the REX-Osprey Solana and Staking ETF—this week. It will offer exposure to spot Solana with staking rewards. Solana’s price jumped on the news, and its DeFi ecosystem continues to outpace Ethereum in DEX volume. At the same time, crypto ETPs saw $2.7 billion in inflows last week, bringing the H1 total to $17.8 billion. Bitcoin ETPs led the charge, while XRP also showed strong momentum despite still pending US ETF approval. CoinShares data showed that BlackRock dominated issuer inflows. Good Approval Odds for Solana, XRP and LTC ETFs Analysts at Bloomberg raised the odds of approval for several highly anticipated crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). They now forecast a 95% chance that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will greenlight spot ETFs for Solana, XRP, and Litecoin by the end of the year. This is an increase from the previous 90% estimate, which means that there is growing optimism in the ETF research community that other crypto investment products will soon be available to US investors. The update came from Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, who said in a post on X that they expect a ”wave of new ETFs” in the second half of 2025. Alongside individual altcoins, they also predict a 95% approval likelihood for a spot ETF based on a basket or index of crypto assets—potentially arriving as early as this week. Other altcoins like Dogecoin, Cardano, Polkadot, Hedera, and Avalanche also received a bullish 90% approval forecast, with their decisions expected in the fourth quarter. However, analysts assigned more cautious odds to ETFs based on Sui and Tron, estimating their chances at 60% and 50%, respectively. Unfortunately, the SEC continues to drag its feet on Ethereum-related products. On Monday, it postponed its decision on whether the Bitwise spot Ether ETF would be allowed to include staking. The regulator also delayed a separate ruling on the approval of the Osprey Bitcoin Trust for listing and trading. This proves that there is still some caution and regulatory hesitancy around certain crypto investment structures. First US Staked Crypto ETF Launches This Week Despite its delays with ETH products, the United States is still about to see the launch of its first-ever staked crypto ETF. Scheduled for debut on Wednesday, the REX-Osprey Solana and Staking ETF will provide investors with direct exposure to spot Solana (SOL) while also offering the opportunity to earn yield through staking. This unique combination is seen as a potential catalyst for even more institutional involvement in crypto investment products. The ETF's issuer, REX Shares, confirmed the launch just days after early reports hinted at its imminent arrival. The product is turning heads not only for being the first staked crypto ETF in the U., but also for navigating the very complex regulatory landscape. Initially, the SEC expressed concerns about the ETF’s C-Corporation structure, and suggested that it conflicted with existing ETF rules. However, after REX submitted an updated prospectus and made key adjustments, the SEC provided positive feedback, which then allowed the product to move forward. This development followed a May ruling by the SEC affirming that staking does not violate existing securities laws, although the agency still delayed decisions on other staking-related ETFs and altcoin funds. The REX-Osprey ETF could therefore serve as a benchmark for future products seeking similar structures. On the day of the ETF announcement, Solana’s price saw a good boost by climbing 6% to around $158 and pushing its seven-day gain to over 12%. Despite the upward momentum, SOL is still 48% below its all-time high from January. Still, with a market cap of $83.5 billion, Solana is now the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by valuation. SOL’s price action over the past week (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Solana's rising prominence is also reflected in its performance in the decentralized exchange (DEX) space. Recent data shows that Solana-based DEX volumes surpassed those of Ethereum, with platforms like Raydium, Pump.fun, and Orca leading the charge. This surge in DeFi activity, combined with the launch of a staking-enabled ETF, sheds some light on Solana’s growing influence in the crypto ecosystem. It also suggests that a new chapter of institutional and retail engagement may be unfolding. Crypto ETP Inflows Hit $17.8 Billion in H1 2025 Overall, cryptocurrency investment products continued their impressive momentum last week, with global exchange-traded products (ETPs) attracting $2.7 billion in new inflows. This was their 11th consecutive week of positive movement. The sustained streak pushed total net inflows for the first half of 2025 to $17.8 billion, according to a new report from digital asset manager CoinShares. Although slightly lower than the $18.3 billion that was recorded during the same period in 2024, the figure represents a resilient performance despite market fluctuations. Weekly crypto flows (Source: CoinShares ) Bitcoin investment products dominated the space by contributing $14.9 billion, or close to 84% of all inflows for the year-to-date period. In just the past week, Bitcoin ETPs brought in $2.2 billion, accounting for 83% of total inflows. Ethereum ETPs followed with a more modest but still impressive $429 million in weekly inflows, bringing their half-year total to $2.9 billion, or 16.3% of all inflows so far this year. Flows per asset (Source: CoinShares ) XRP also maintained its position among the top performers by recording $10.6 million in inflows last week and $219 million for the first half of the year. XRP’s strong showing is especially major when considering that spot XRP ETFs are still pending approval in the United States. However, Canada already moved forward, and launched these products on June 18, offering investors a regulated way to get exposure to the asset. From an issuer perspective, BlackRock emerged as the clear leader after pulling in over $17 billion in inflows during the first six months of 2025. This represents 96% of all new capital entering crypto ETPs over that time period. ProShares and Fidelity trailed with $526 million and $246 million, respectively, while Grayscale Investments saw nearly $1.7 billion in net outflows. The CoinShares report came as Bitcoin experienced a slight pullback , dipping just below $108,000 after a week-long rally that took it from around $101,000 on June 23 to nearly $107,800. Despite minor corrections, the continued inflows into crypto ETPs indicate robust investor confidence in digital assets.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9763/analysts-give-95-chance-for-solana-xrp-and-ltc-etf-approval,"SOL|XRP|LTC|TRADING|BTC","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-07-01T09:30:00,"Top 2 Best Cryptocurrencies to Invest in Before They Jump 100% in the Next Bull Run","When it comes to making profits in the crypto sector, timing is everything. If you are looking forward to the next big gainer in the upcoming bull run, now is the time to start searching. You need to identify a promising project like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that can have a competitive edge for sustained gains. If you are looking to make 100% or more gains in the upcoming bull run, here are the two main options you should closely watch and consider including in your crypto portfolio. Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin (BTC) recently hit a new all-time high of over $111,0000. All signs indicate that it is due for a massive pump in the next bull run. One reason for this optimistic forecast is growing institutional adoption. For instance, the US recently passed the GENIUS Act. Before that, Trump signed an executive order authorizing the creation of a Bitcoin Reserve. With all these positive developments around BTC, including greater legal clarity, the next bull run could see BTC gain 100%. However, it is worth noting that BTC is already trading at the top of its pricing. As such, a 100% gain may not come soon enough for most people. While you could hold on for years to come, there is a better option in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) A Deep Dive Into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in phase 5 of its presale, where tokens are going for $0.03. The current price represents a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. So far, over $11.3 million has been raised in the presale from around 12,550 unique buyers. The token price is set to increase by 16.67% in the upcoming phase 6 to $0.035. One reason why analysts are so confident of 100% gains for MUTM tokens is the planned listing price of $0.06. Based on that listing price, purchasing MUTM tokens already guarantees you a 100% return. In the upcoming phase 6, that return will dip to 71.43%. So far, investors have taken that calculation into consideration, buying up 50% of the tokens set aside for phase 5, barely a month after they went live. As such, analysts predict that MUTM tokens could rise more than 100%. Their predictions point to gains of 2300%. One reason why analysts are so optimistic about the future price of MUTM tokens is that the whole project is built on utility. Unlike meme coins, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed to support the continuous price increase of the native MUTM tokens. One unique design feature of this project is the buyback program. In this program, Mutuum Finance will use protocol profits to buy MUTM tokens off the open market. That will lead to huge price increases over time. Best of all, since the protocol has so much utility built into it, protocol profits are expected to keep rising over time. Bug Bounty Program Another reason why investors project such massive gains for MUTM tokens is the recent $50,000 USDT bug bounty program. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team has partnered with CertiK on this program. It will offer incentives to get the global security community to help maintain the safety of the ecosystem. The program will be split into four tiers, which are critical, major, minor, and low. Depending on the potential impact of a vulnerability, the team will share out a reward of the appropriate size. The Mutuum Finance Protocol Mutuum Finance is a decentralized noncustodial protocol where users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. As lenders, they deposit their assets into the protocol for the chance to receive interest on their deposits. Borrowers can deposit overcollateralized collateral into the protocol to access these funds. Interest rates for both lenders and borrowers are based on the pool utilization rate. For instance, when a lender deposits $10,000 USDC in a pool, the utilization rate could increase, pushing the yield to 12%. In such a case, the lender will earn $1,200 on their deposit per year. That presents an easy way to make passive income that does not require one to engage in complex trading strategies. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is The Top Crypto For Massive Returns While there are several crypto coins that could rise 100% or more in the next bull run, MUTM tokens offer the best possibility for massive returns. Analysts forecast a modest increase of 23x in returns when they go live. To be part of this massive opportunity, all you need to do is add MUTM tokens to your portfolio by participating in the ongoing presale.

Ethereum suffered an even steeper fall of 45.41%, its worst quarterly performance since the 2022 bear market.

At this point, Trump-linked company American Bitcoin has raised $220 million to purchase Bitcoin and mining equipment. American Bitcoin, a Bitcoin mining company backed by two sons of US President Donald Trump, has raised $220 million to purchase BTC and BTC mining equipment, Bloomberg reported. The financing comes after the company issued and sold more than 11 million new shares to private investors last Friday. Approximately $10 million worth of shares were sold for Bitcoin instead of dollars, at an exchange rate of $104,000 per Bitcoin. “The Company intends to use the proceeds to fund its strategic and Bitcoin accumulation objectives, which may include, but are not limited to, the purchase of Bitcoin and mining equipment.” American Bitcoin was co-founded by Eric Trump and fellow Bitcoin miner Hut8. Meanwhile, American Bitcoin is aiming to list on the Nasdaq through an all-stock merger with Gryphon Digital Mining, a mining company listed on the Nasdaq.

In a new episode of the All-In Podcast, Palihapitiya takes a close look at the M2 money supply chart, which has been on the up and up. The billionaire notes that M2 growth is one of the key reasons why the S&P 500 is in the midst of a strong uptrend. “If I was a betting man… I think the free money trade here is to be levered long. I think you can make a lot of money right now. Why is that? The first chart I want to show you is the velocity of money… This is the M2 money supply. It’s a measure of how much money is circulating in the economy. What this shows is the impact of rates, where we were able to start to slow down and contract the money supply. But then as the economy stabilized and people started to project what was possible in 18 to 24 months, you started to see money coming back into the system. That’s what has given a bid to the equity markets.” Source: FRED The billionaire is also keeping a close watch on the amount of money invested in money market funds, which are financial instruments that provide yields that are largely influenced by the prevailing interest rates set by the Federal Reserve. Palihapitiya says that once the Fed starts cutting rates, trillions of dollars in capital stashed in money market funds will likely be invested in the stock market. “Look at how much money is sitting in money market funds, and what this starts to show you is you have trillions of trillions of dollars of dry powder in the sidelines that will need to find a home. I think that [Fed chair] Jerome Powell is in an increasingly [untenable] situation because he will be looked at as politicizing the office of the Federal Reserve. There is enough data that can justify cutting rates. If you cut rates, two things will happen. Number one is people will take some amount of money out of the money market funds because they will want to go and seek superior returns somewhere else. It will increase the velocity of money at the same time. You put those two things together that is a bid to the equity markets. And so if we’re at an all-time high today with rates at 4.5% and Powell’s back is against the wall to cut, the only road from here is probably up… I think if Powell starts an aggressive cutting program… you could see the S&P 500 at 7,000.” Source: FRED As of Monday’s close, the S&P 500 is trading at record-high levels of 6,204.

2025-07-01T09:15:19,"Japanese gaming firm CyberStep plans to invest 1b yen into its new crypto arm","Japanese online claw machine operator CyberStep is launching a new business arm called CRYPTECH Capital which will generate tokens used to buy BTC and ETH as reserve assets. According to a recent report on CoinDesk Japan, the company that operates the online claw machine game “Toreba” has established its own dedicated crypto stockpile firm to manage its corporate crypto holdings. The newly established branch is called “CRYPTECH Capital” and it is responsible for building a new revenue base for the company built with a web3 focus. Rather than issuing commercial shares or opening stock bids to generate revenue for a dedicated crypto treasury, CyberStep plans to adopt a new business strategy dubbed the “self-circulating token economy” instead. As a starter, the company will allocate 200 million yen from its own funds as an initial purchasing budget in the fiscal year that ends in May 2026. Afterwards, the company plans to gradually increase the funds allocated to the strategic reserve to as much as 1 billion yen ($6.9 million). However, the firm stated that the plan is still subject to change depending on market conditions. You might also like: Japanese fashion brand ANAP buys more Bitcoin ahead of 1,000 BTC goal The strategy involves CyberStep creating and promoting their own in-game tokens from the company’s web3 game services. The generated native token stockpile will then be exchanged for major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ). The major tokens will be stored within the company’s balance sheets and classified under “corporate assets.” An example of a “self-circulating token” created by the gaming firm include the Eggle Energy token $ENG that was launched by the firm last April. The tokens were part of a larger venture that involved a blockchain game called Eggle and an NFT line in the works. In addition to Eggle Energy tokens, CyberStep’s Cryptech Capital also plans to invest in promising meme coins and other web3 gaming tokens in the crypto space. “The company plans to achieve both capital gains from rising asset prices and income gains through staking and providing liquidity to DeFi protocols across its portfolio,” wrote the company in its translated press release. Most recently, the Swedish gaming firm Fragbite also released plans to establish its own crypto stockpile. However, the focus would lie mostly on Bitcoins as the sole reserve asset, investing some of its corporate funds into acquiring BTC.

Just weeks after the U.S. President Donald Trump publicly praised Elon Musk as a “wonderful man,” their relationship took a sharp, unexpected turn. As the Senate debated Trump’s much-hyped spending legislation, nicknamed the “big, beautiful bill,” Musk fired back with a threat. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO announced that if Trump’s bill passed, he would launch a brand-new political party called The America Party . But Musk didn’t stop there. Taking to his platform X, the billionaire slammed lawmakers for approving what he called the “biggest debt increase in history.” He warned that those who supported the bill would lose their primary elections next year, vowing to make it happen “if it’s the last thing I do on this earth.” I am literally saying CUT IT ALL. Now. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 1, 2025 Trump hit back just as hard. In a post on Truth Social, the president accused Musk of being deeply dependent on government subsidies, hinting that without federal support, Musk would have to “close up shop and head back home to South Africa.” “No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE. Perhaps we should have DOGE take a good, hard, look at this? BIG MONEY TO BE SAVED,” Trump wrote. “I am literally saying CUT IT ALL. Now,” Musk said.

2025-07-01T09:08:58,"Bitcoin Pepe Trends No.1 on X as Listing Approaches","With frogs, speculation, and screenshots of big buys dominating the feed, Bitcoin Pepe is currently trending #1 on X. Its next major announcement just dropped, confirming that MEXC will be listing BPEP, and the community has gone into a frenzy in response. With over $500,000 in inflows on June 27th alone and a total of $16.1m raised so far at only $0.0437, early backers are eyeing generational gains. Rumors are now swirling around further tier-1 exchange listings, which could be confirmed as early as July 31st, when the team drops its next major announcement. The last three updates (on June 1st,17th, and 30th) brought in over $1M combined, and all delivered visible progress. Many now expect this next announcement to change everything, possibly more official listing information or a large-scale partner activation—Binance and Coinbase rumors are persisting. Visit the official website now for the latest updates—nothing in the Bitcoin world will remain the same after this. Bitcoin Pepe is building a Solana-like L2 on Bitcoin Bitcoin Pepe is introducing two innovations: a new token standard (PEP-20) and a custom Layer 2 built for memes, NFTs, and low-gas trading. Both are designed to make Bitcoin a serious home for the kind of activity that usually happens on Solana, Base, or Ethereum. PEP-20 acts like Ethereum's ERC-20, but on Bitcoin. That means creators, developers, and meme makers can finally issue tokens on BTC in a native, permissionless way without workarounds or third-party bridges. Until now, there’s never been an open standard for meme asset creation on the network. Bitcoin Pepe’s layer 2 is where it all comes to life. It’s built to handle fast transactions, low fees, wallet compatibility, and a much better UI than anything Bitcoin meme builders have had access to before. Bitcoin Pepe price prediction: Is this the last chance to buy low? With Bitcoin Pepe’s next announcement now just hours away, price predictions are getting wild. This may be the last window to grab BPEP at only $0.0437 before it gets snatched up on major exchanges. The BitMart listing announcement on June 30th alone created nearly $300K of buy pressure, and the July 31st announcement is expected to unlock a wave of new volume, visibility, and exchange access. After the first staking pool sold out, a new pool was released with 1.5 million BPEP tokens and a 15,000% APY. This is going to move quickly, especially as insiders are hinting at listings from top-tier exchanges. That means visibility, liquidity, and price action. A flood of new users could send BPEP soaring right out of the gate. In the meantime, Bitcoin Pepe has been stacking partnerships that expand its utility, exposure, and credibility. The most recent one, Me3 , just onboarded BPEP into its AI-driven Web3 portal with over 300,000 users and 200,000+ social followers. The relationship adds smart onboarding, viral boost, and access to a highly active base of crypto-native users. On social media, BPEP is dominating. Top X influencers are flooding timelines, praising the design, speed, and upcoming announcement potential. With Bitcoin on track for a new ATH , BPEP could be the breakout 100x alt of this BTC cycle. Stakes are rising before the Bitcoin Pepe launch New exchanges are now onboard, and Bitcoin Pepe is trending #1 on X as the hype swells to a boiling point. Bitcoin Pepe is about to do something no meme has ever done before: tap into Bitcoin’s untouched liquidity and inject it with full-on degen energy. With BitMart’s listing already generating $300k of buy pressure and only hours left before the next announcement, timing is everything.

2025-07-01T09:06:00,"$16.1m Bet on PEP-20: How Bitcoin’s New Token Standard Went Viral","The post $16.1m Bet on PEP-20: How Bitcoin’s New Token Standard Went Viral appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News How did a meme ICO raise millions and force two major exchanges to move before its token even launched? Bitcoin Pepe just cracked $16.1m as $500k flowed in on June 27 alone. MEXC will list Bitcoin Pepe immediately after the presale, following Bitmart’s earlier listing announcement on June 17, which triggered a separate $300k surge in funding. The project introduces PEP-20, Bitcoin’s first native token standard for open asset issuance. With staking pools filling rapidly, leaked demo images, and the final announcement coming July 31, the stakes are growing each day. To follow updates or participate, the official website is the only place to go. Bitcoin Pepe: First-mover on Bitcoin Bitcoin Pepe’s layer 2 is being built directly on Bitcoin. It’s launching core infrastructure to enable tokenized meme culture at the base level of crypto’s most recognized chain. Central to that is PEP-20, a new token standard designed to allow anyone to issue assets directly on Bitcoin. Interface previews show a clean wallet bridge that lets users move BTC to the Layer 2 and receive BPEP tokens. The bridge includes real-time compatibility warnings, basic safety checks, and a clear, minimal interface for faster onboarding. Bitcoin Pepe filled its new staking pool in minutes, a detail that speaks more to market conviction than any marketing campaign could. Early backers are now directly tied to the system’s security and utility through locked assets, incentivizing long-term holding rather than speculative flipping. Bitcoin Pepe price outlook: Here’s how BPEP went viral Historically, when asset issuance becomes accessible, like ERC-20 did for Ethereum, the volume of economic activity explodes. With PEP-20, Bitcoin finally gets a simple, extensible foundation for permissionless token creation. Early momentum has been consistent. The first staking pool filled in under 10 minutes, and now a second pool has launched, offering 1.5 million tokens at 15,000 APY%, and is already seeing rapid uptake. Such activity proves deep demand but also deeper potential illiquidity: once tokens are locked, circulating supply tightens, and pricing can dislocate fast. The Bitcoin Pepe layer 2 leaks show a working bridge, DEX, and explorer; PEP-20 is defined, and the project has now announced nine partnerships across gaming, DeFi, and content ecosystems. This includes Me3, which will integrate Bitcoin Pepe’s Layer 2 with AI onboarding and user conversion tools, bringing 300,000 active users and over a million monthly interactions into direct contact with BPEP. With MEXC now confirmed and Bitmart already onboard, Bitcoin Pepe is preparing for its first listings after the presale closes. The T1 listing on MEXC puts BPEP in front of a large, active trading base with deep liquidity and no presale requirements. Buyers won’t need to bridge, swap, or use unfamiliar tools; they’ll be able to buy directly. When BPEP goes live, latecomers will be fighting over limited supply. Social activity has spiked across every major crypto platform, particularly X , where multiple independent analysts flagged BPEP as the “Solana moment” for Bitcoin. Could it do 1000x the same way Solana did? It’s possible. Even a fraction of that, backed by a fresh layer 2, a real token standard, and BTC’s credibility, would make this a historic launch. Bitcoin Pepe: The trade of this cycle? In just weeks, Bitcoin Pepe has built a Layer 2, introduced a new token standard, raised $16.1m, filled staking pools, and secured multiple exchange listings. The next—and final—announcement is scheduled for July 31, and interest is only accelerating. Bitcoin has regained strength on the back of renewed capital inflows and worsening dollar sentiment. However, most participants remain priced out of BTC’s price range, now at around $108k . Bitcoin Pepe offers a speculative instrument directly connected to the chain’s upside, without needing to buy Bitcoin itself . The next major trade is on Bitcoin. Not in BTC, but in the stack being built around it. BPEP, currently at only $0.0437, could be the most important trade of this cycle—visit the Bitcoin Pepe website to learn more and make a purchase.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/information/16-1m-bet-on-pep-20-how-bitcoins-new-token-standard-went-viral/,"BTC|TRADING|ZRX|MINING|SOL","Information",cryptocompare

2025-07-01T09:01:27,"Best crypto to buy now as Trump-linked American Bitcoin raises $220M","The cryptocurrency market traded mostly lower on Tuesday, with Bitcoin hovering near $107,000 mark as traders remained on edge ahead of the July 9 US tariff deadline. Market sentiment appeared mixed , with altcoins showing divergent trends amid lingering macroeconomic uncertainty. However, Bitcoin’s performance over the past few months has been resilient. Bitcoin registered a strong monthly close in June, with a candle settling just above $107,000—the highest on record. That follows prior monthly highs in May and January, which closed around $104,600 and $102,450, respectively. The latest close marks the third consecutive monthly gain and continues a broader rebound from Bitcoin’s April lows near $75,000. Bitcoin’s resilient performance has helped improve sentiment across the broader market. The positive sentiment is also seen in the early-stage project, Bitcoin Pepe . Trump-linked American Bitcoin raises $220 million American Bitcoin, the newly launched mining venture backed by Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., has raised $220 million through a private placement, according to a recent SEC filing . The funding round, disclosed by majority stakeholder Hut 8, involved the issuance and sale of over 11 million new shares to private investors last Friday. Notably, approximately $10 million worth of the shares were purchased using Bitcoin, at an exchange rate of $104,000 per BTC. “The Company intends to use the net proceeds to fund its strategic and Bitcoin accumulation goals, which may include, but are not limited to, the purchase of Bitcoin and/or miners,” the filing stated. After deducting fees and expenses, American Bitcoin netted roughly $215 million. The venture officially launched in late March as a joint initiative between Hut 8 and American Data Centers, a firm tied to the Trump family. The move deepens the Trumps’ involvement in digital assets, aligning with the president’s broader push to establish US leadership in blockchain and crypto infrastructure. Bitcoin Pepe continues to see strong interest As Bitcoin maintains its position above key technical support levels, institutional participation continues to underpin broader market confidence. The relative calm is prompting investors to shift capital into higher-risk assets, with meme coins seeing a renewed surge in inflows. One of the standout beneficiaries of this trend is Bitcoin Pepe, a meme-themed project that diverges from traditional tokens in the category by offering an infrastructure-driven roadmap. Positioned as the first meme-centric Layer 2 on the Bitcoin network, the project aims to integrate the base-layer security of Bitcoin with the speed and scalability features typically associated with Solana. Describing itself as an initiative to “build Solana on Bitcoin,” Bitcoin Pepe is attempting to differentiate through technology rather than purely community engagement. The project introduces its own token standard and infrastructure layer to support on-chain activity, a notable deviation from meme tokens that trade solely on social momentum. The project’s presale has raised $16.2 million, with investor interest accelerating as the token offering nears completion. According to the development team, the BPEP token is scheduled to be listed on both MEXC and BitMart, two centralised exchanges that could improve trading access and liquidity. A final listing announcement is expected on July 31, adding to the anticipation surrounding the project’s final presale stages.

2025-07-01T08:50:52,"Bitcoin Rally Slows as Traders Take Profits, Analysts Signal Consolidation Ahead","After dropping to its year-to-date low of $73,273 on April 9, Bitcoin has surged nearly 41% to $107,380, data from CoinMarketCap shows. However, analysts at Bitfinex noted on Monday that, for the first time during this uptrend, “momentum has begun to fade.” The report pointed out that onchain metrics and order flow data suggest Bitcoin might now be heading into a period of consolidation or reaching a local top, instead of continuing its “vertical acceleration.” Spot volume has cooled, taker buy pressure has weakened, and profit-taking has picked up — especially among short-term holders who have benefited from the rally from sub-$80,000 levels. ETF Inflows Continue but Macro Factors Remain Key Despite the short-term cooling, Bitcoin’s next move will hinge on macroeconomic developments and sustained institutional demand, particularly from spot Bitcoin ETFs. US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs have posted inflows for 14 consecutive trading days since June 9, totaling $4.63 billion in net inflows by June 27, according to data from Farside Investors. Economist Timothy Peterson described last week’s $2.2 billion ETF inflows as “massive” and expects the trend to continue this week, adding there is a “70% chance next week will be positive too, which generally correlates to upward price pressure.” Additionally, market participants are closely monitoring the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision on July 30, with lower rates typically providing a bullish backdrop for crypto markets. According to the CME FedWatch tool, markets currently see a 19% chance of a rate cut at the meeting. Long-Term Holders Seen as Key to Resuming Uptrend While uncertainty clouds Bitcoin’s short-term direction, analysts remain optimistic about the broader market structure, emphasizing that higher time frame support levels are holding. “The current data points to a transition phase,” the Bitfinex report noted, indicating a likely period of consolidation before the next major move. Economist Donald Dean remains bullish, stating , “Bitcoin is getting ready to move higher with tight consolidation at the volume shelf.” Meanwhile, Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards pointed out that long-term holders, or “Bitcoin OGs,” have been “dumping on Wall Street” since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, preventing prices from breaking out sustainably above the $100,000 level despite institutional demand.

Key Takeaways: Sparkassen will launch crypto trading for 50 million customers by summer 2026. Dekabank will manage the new service, enabling Bitcoin and Ether trades directly in Sparkassen’s app. The move signals growing momentum among German banks to integrate crypto. According to Bloomberg , Dekabank, owned by Sparkassen, will oversee the crypto offering through the group’s mobile banking app, enabling direct trading of Bitcoin and Ether. The German Savings Banks Association (DSGV) confirmed the move, stating it will provide customers with “reliable access to a regulated crypto offering,” now allowed under the EU’s MiCA framework, which took effect in December. Sparkassen Reverses Course After 2015 Crypto Ban Over Volatility Fears Sparkassen’s leadership had previously rejected crypto services due to volatility concerns and even blocked crypto purchases for all customers in 2015. While the group has changed course, the DSGV stressed its caution, labeling cryptocurrencies “highly speculative investments” and promising no marketing campaigns for the new feature. Customers will instead receive detailed information about risks, including the chance of total losses. Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe spans more than 500 financial institutions, including over 370 savings banks, and manages over €2.5 trillion ($2.9 trillion) in assets, giving the crypto initiative significant potential reach. Industry voices have welcomed the move. ERA Labs CEO Filipp Bolotov called it a “big move for mainstream adoption,” while Master Ventures’ Kyle Chasse said it shows banks are “catching up” to crypto’s evolution. BREAKING: GERMANY’S TOP BANK GROUP SPARKASSEN TO OFFER RETAIL CRYPTO TRADING BY 2026. THE BANKS ARE CATCHING UP!!! pic.twitter.com/rrykogR1Tl — Kyle Chassé / DD (@kyle_chasse) June 30, 2025 Other major German banks have already begun integrating crypto services. DZ Bank, Germany’s second-largest lender, partnered with Boerse Stuttgart Digital last year to pilot crypto trading and custody services, aiming to expand offerings across its 700 cooperative banks after initial trials. Meanwhile, Landesbank Baden-Württemberg, the country’s biggest federal bank, announced plans in April 2024 to provide crypto custody services for institutional clients in collaboration with Bitpanda. The momentum isn’t limited to Germany. Speaking in April, Eric Trump warned that banks resisting crypto could become obsolete within a decade, highlighting issues of speed and cost in traditional finance. And during Paris Blockchain Week, Messari’s Eric Turner and Sygnum Bank’s Thomas Eichenberger predicted a deeper push by banks into crypto services later this year as regulatory clarity improves. Ric Edelman Urges Advisors to Allocate Up to 40% to Crypto As reported, veteran advisor Ric Edelman is calling for crypto allocations of up to 40% in investment portfolios, a dramatic jump from his earlier 1% guidance. He told CNBC that questions around government bans and institutional adoption have been resolved, making crypto a mainstream asset. Edelman pointed to strong inflows into Bitcoin ETFs as evidence of crypto’s acceptance among investors and advisors. He said the traditional 60/40 stock-bond portfolio no longer suits today’s longer life expectancies, requiring strategies with higher return potential. Edelman also pointed out crypto’s uncorrelated performance with traditional assets, arguing that it can provide essential diversification and boost risk-adjusted returns.

Specifically, the number of large Bitcoin transactions exceeding $100,000 has decreased by 45.3% over the past month. The transactions peaked at around 30,840 on May 22 but fell to just 16,860 by June 29, according to data from the crypto analytics platform IntoTheBlock . Bitcoin whale transaction data. Source: IntoTheBlock The steep decline often signals reduced activity from whales and institutions. This drop indicates potential weakening confidence and thinning liquidity, which increases the risk of Bitcoin slipping below the key $100,000 support level . If large-scale buying continues to wane, the market could face deeper volatility unless new demand emerges. Capital inflow into crypto plunges $20 billion At the same time, broader cryptocurrency market trends echo this caution. Capital inflows into cryptocurrencies have declined by more than $20 billion, suggesting a shift in investor sentiment. Glassnode data shows the net position change in realized value, a measure of capital entering or exiting the market, dropped from nearly $55 billion in late May to $34 billion by June 28. Crypto market realized value change. Source: Glassnode This drawdown highlights a slowdown in momentum across major assets, including Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH ), both of which had experienced steady accumulation earlier in the second quarter. Bitcoin price analysis Currently, Bitcoin’s key support level is at $105,000. Holding above this level is critical for any attempt to reclaim $110,000 and push toward new all-time highs . As of press time, BTC was trading at $106,972, down 0.6% on the day and 0.3% for the week. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Technically, Bitcoin remains in a bullish posture.

2025-07-01T08:40:08,"Why Did Bitcoin's Rise Stop? Is There a Possibility of a New Rally for BTC? Bitfinex Analysts Explained!","As the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) continues its sideways trend, investors are eagerly waiting for a major rally to come. However, Bitfinex analysts said the Bitcoin rally was losing momentum as profit-taking increased and volume decreased. Uptrend Momentum Weakening! Bitcoin’s nearly three-month rally appears to be losing momentum as buying pressure weakens and profit-taking intensifies, Bitfinex analysts said. Although BTC has surged 40% from its April lows to above $107,000, analysts argued that the market has entered a consolidation phase rather than continuing its sharp uptrend. Analysts claimed that falling Bitcoin spot volume is entering a period of consolidation rather than sustained bullish momentum and could signal a local top. As Bitcoin loses its upward momentum, analysts said that BTC's next move will depend on macro factors and institutional demand, especially from ETF inflows. “For the first time in Bitcoin’s nearly three-month-old uptrend, momentum has begun to fade. Spot trading volume cooled, buyers' buying pressure weakened, and profit taking intensified. The selling is particularly concentrated among short-term investors who are evaluating the move from levels below $80,000. At this point, Bitcoin's bullish momentum remains dependent on ETF inflows and macro factors.” Despite the short-term uncertainty in Bitcoin at this point, analysts said that the longer-term bullish structure remains strong and said, “Current data points to a transition phase.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-01T08:30:14,"Analyst Calls For Bitcoin Crash As Price Pulls Above $108,000 — Details","The past weekend was favorable for Bitcoin as the price was able to rebound from last week’s lows and go on to reclaim $108,000 ahead of the new week. This has boosted market sentiment once again, prompting investors to return to the table. However, as the price continues to sit in the green, one crypto analyst has sounded the alarm that the Bitcoin price may be headed for another crash toward the support area close to $100,000. Why A Bitcoin Price Crash Is Imminent In the TradingView analysis, the crypto analyst reveals the reason why the Bitcoin price could dump back downwards is because of mounting resistance. This is because, as the leading cryptocurrency moves toward new all-time highs, there is the possibility of a pushback before it is able to continue its rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidating Below $108,000 But Eyes $115,000 Target In this case, the crypto analyst does expect the Bitcoin price to keep rising. But they see a lot of resistance for the digital asset just above $109,000. More specifically, at $109,500, which is still a ways away from the $112,000 needed to create a new all-time high, the cryptocurrency is expected to meet new resistance and dump back downward. This stiff resistance opens up an opportunity for market shooters to enter into the trade. According to the chart, it is possible for the Bitcoin price to actually move toward the low $100,000s. Currently, there is major support at $102,500, and if the digital asset does lose its footing, this is likely where the bulls will stage their recovery once more. Sweeping For Liquidity At Lower Ranges Another crypto analyst, Riscora, has supported this move with their own analysis, also predicting that a pullback is possible from here. This still boils down to mounting resistance as the Bitcoin price moves toward the possibility of reaching a new all-time high, and budding liquidity rises at the lower levels. Related Reading: TD Sequential Flashes Buy: Dogecoin Ready For Rebound To $0.21 The analyst explains that as liquidity has now been taken in the higher levels, after Bitcoin hit $108,000, there is bound to be a correction. This time around, they expect the correction to be much deeper given the recent bullish impulse move. The target from her sis a move back into the $107,000 territory, before moving further downward to take on the $106,400 support. Despite the expectation of a price dip, the analyst warns that the Bitcoin price remains overall bullish from here. As the crypto market ushers in the month of July, which is usually bullish for Bitcoin, it is possible that the cryptocurrency does put in a new all-time high this month, seeing as there is less than a 5% move left to beat its current $111,900 peak.

2025-07-01T08:21:59,"Bitcoin, Ethereum & XRP Price Prediction for July 2025","The post Bitcoin, Ethereum & XRP Price Prediction for July 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market cap today has nudged up 0.42% to $3.3 trillion, reflecting a cautiously optimistic stance from investors. The Fear & Greed Index stands at 50, signaling neutrality after a month of volatility. While trading volume rose by 13.08% to $99.85 billion, key assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum remain range-bound. XRP, on the other hand, is seeing renewed traction ahead of a pivotal SEC meeting and a major tech upgrade. In this analysis, we will explore where BTC, ETH, and XRP are heading in July. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction Bitcoin is currently trading at $106,912, with intraday movement limited between $106,759 and $107,971. Despite a slight -0.65% dip, sentiment remains neutral. Notably, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF has surpassed $72 billion in AUM, highlighting growing institutional interest even as retail participation flattens. From a technical standpoint, Bitcoin continues to consolidate between $104,000 and $110,000, forming a potential accumulation pattern. If BTC sustains support above $106,000 and volume picks up, a move toward $113,000, followed by $120,000, is on the cards. However, failure to maintain the current range could expose BTC to a minor pullback toward $101,500. Also read our Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030 for long-term targets! Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction Ethereum is showing signs of internal strength, trading flat at $2,462. Price action remains within the range of $2,438–$2,521, but a fast-declining exchange supply, now at 17.1 million ETH, suggests investors are moving tokens off centralized platforms in anticipation of future gains. The narrowing price range and dwindling supply typically signal a breakout brewing. A push above $2,550 could open up a run toward $2,650, while failure to hold $2,420 could invite a short-term correction back to $2,200. The bias remains cautiously bullish as long as on-chain data supports accumulation. Check out our Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! Ripple XRP Price Prediction XRP is up nearly 2% at $2.22, riding momentum from the announcement of an EVM-compatible sidechain launch and a critical Ripple vs SEC meeting scheduled for July 3. These developments have created renewed enthusiasm in the community, as evidenced by a healthy $4.05B in daily volume. Technically speaking, XRP is holding above the $2.17 support zone. If bullish momentum persists and positive news comes from the SEC front, XRP could test the $2.35 resistance, and possibly aim for $2.80 in an extended rally. Which could also stretch to $3. However, any delay or unfavorable outcome could drag XRP back toward the $2.15 level. Read our Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! FAQs Will Bitcoin hit a new ATH in July 2025?

2025-07-01T08:13:51,"Ripple’s XRP set for a bullish breakout; check forecast","The cryptocurrency market is having a positive start to the week, with Bitcoin and Ether currently in the green. Bitcoin is trading just below $108k while Ether looks set to hit the $2,500 mark once again. The week promises to be an interesting one, with traders keeping an eye on macroeconomic data such as the May job openings, the Labor Turnover Survey, as well as June nonfarm payrolls and the unemployment rate. Furthermore, traders are also turning their attention to tomorrow’s speech by Jerome Powell at an ECB forum panel alongside central bank governors from the UK, South Korea, and Japan. While Bitcoin and Ether will take center stage, Ripple’s XRP is another coin that will be in the mix. XRP could rally higher this week amid strong fundamental and technical indicators. XRP to rally higher as SEC-Ripple case approaches conclusion XRP, the native coin of the Ripple ecosystem, could be one of the best performers over the next few days. Its rally could be fueled by the ongoing case between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On Friday, Ripple Labs’ CEO Brad Garlinghouse revealed that the company is dropping its appeal against the regulator in a prolonged legal battle tied to the sale of its XRP tokens. The announcement is set to bring the dispute closer to resolution after years of back-and-forth between the company and the regulator. The two sides agreed to settle if the judge set aside her injunction and approved lowering the $125 million fine she had imposed on Ripple. While the judge rejected their request, market participants anticipate that the case is now closer to its end. Ending the case will be beneficial to Ripple Labs as it would allow the company to focus on its products, especially its recently launched stablecoin, RLUSD. This could benefit XRP as investors can purchase the tokens without the fear of regarding it as a security. XRP is on the verge of a bullish breakout The XRP/USD 4-hour chart is bearish, but technical indicators show that the pair is reversing this situation. XRP added 7% to its value over the last seven days and now trades around $2.18 per coin. The MACD lines are within the positive territory, suggesting a bullish scenario for the cryptocurrency. Furthermore, the RSI of 58 indicates a fading bearish momentum for the pair. At press time, XRP is approaching its key resistance at $2.23. If the coin breaks and closes above this resistance level, it could extend the rally and hit the next major resistance level at $2.47. If XRP breaks and closes above its daily resistance at $2.23, it could extend the rally toward its May 23 high of $2.47. However, for the bullish momentum to be sustained, the RSI must enter the overbought region while the MACD lines remain in the bullish zone. On the flipside, if the bearish trend strengthens, XRP could extend the correction to retest its daily support at $1.90.

CertiK recorded 344 on-chain incidents between January and June. Wallet breaches accounted for $1.7 billion in just 34 cases, while phishing scams caused $410 million across 132 incidents. The largest exploit occurred in February when Bybit lost $1.5 billion in a wallet breach involving staked ETH. In May, Cetus Protocol was exploited for $225 million via a smart contract bug, although $162 million was later recovered by Sui validators. Ethereum Targeted Most; Code Bugs Surge Ethereum was the most attacked blockchain, with 175 incidents leading to $1.6 billion in losses. Smart contract vulnerabilities alone caused $229 million in May, up sharply from just $5 million in April. CertiK also flagged an increase in physical attacks, with 32 cases involving violence, kidnappings, and ransom attempts. France saw the most incidents, including an attempted kidnapping involving the family of Paymium’s CEO. [post_titles_links postid=”476963″] Funds Recovered, But Risks Mount Approximately $187 million was recovered through whitehat efforts, law enforcement, and exchange cooperation. However, with attacks becoming more complex and violent, stronger security practices are urgently needed. A key vulnerability remains poor private key management.

2025-07-01T07:54:47,"Crypto lost to hacks and scams in H1 2025 tops 2024 total at $2.5B: CertiK","Nearly $2.5 billion worth of cryptocurrencies were stolen across 290 incidents in the first half of 2025, surpassing total losses recorded in 2024. According to CertiK’s latest Hack3d report shared with crypto.news, compromised wallets accounted for the largest share of losses, totalling over $1.7 billion across 34 incidents. Phishing attacks followed, siphoning more than $410 million in 132 cases, while code vulnerabilities led to losses exceeding $283 million across 114 incidents. Exit scams and price manipulation were less frequent during this period but were still notable, resulting in combined losses of nearly $20 million. Access control exploits accounted for $42 million in damages. Notably, total losses in the first six months of 2025 have already surpassed the $2.42 billion recorded for all of 2024. After adjusting for returned and frozen funds, net losses stand at $2.29 billion, exceeding last year’s adjusted total of $1.98 billion. A significant portion of this year’s losses, roughly 72%, or $1.78 billion, stemmed from two large-scale incidents, the Bybit hack in Q1 and the Cetus protocol exploit in Q2. Excluding these, H1 losses would have stood at around $690 million.

While the pace of attacks slowed significantly in the second quarter, several major incidents still contributed to substantial losses. Phishing was the most widespread attack vector in Q2, accounting for over $395 million in losses across 52 incidents. Code vulnerabilities and access control weaknesses followed, resulting in losses of $235.7 million and $36.1 million, respectively. Wallet compromises, which had dominated Q1, caused $112 million in losses from 9 incidents in Q2. While the Bybit breach remained the most damaging incident of the year, Q2 saw several other high-value breaches involving protocol exploits and infrastructure compromises. These included the $225.6 million exploit of Cetus, the $89.1 million hack of Iran’s Nobitex exchange, and a $16.1 million attack on ALEX Lab. Other incidents involving Bitopro, Cork Protocol , KiloEx , and zkSync-based projects were primarily the result of smart contract flaws, infrastructure breaches, or compromised wallets. Ethereum was the most targeted blockchain, suffering losses of more than $1.58 billion across 164 incidents, while Bitcoin came in second, with over $373 million lost across 10 incidents. CertiK noted that $187 million in stolen funds were returned in the first half of the year, bringing the adjusted total losses to just over $2.28 billion. Of this, $180 million was recovered in Q2 alone. As previously reported by crypto.news, a separate mid-year analysis by blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs estimated $2.1 billion in crypto losses across 75 incidents during the same period, with the majority linked to infrastructure-level breaches such as private key thefts and front-end hijacks.

2025-07-01T07:45:49,"The Spanish police cracked down on a crypto-related fraud ring","Europol announced the organized arrests of a criminal network connected to cryptocurrency investment fraud. The network involved teams in Spain, France, Estonia, as well as the USA. Europol cracked down on a network spreading crypto-related investment fraud. The scammers operated in Spain, France, Estonia, as well as the USA. Law enforcement arranged a series of arrests at the end of June. ‘ To carry out their fraudulent activities, the leaders of the criminal network allegedly used a net of associates spread around the world to raise funds through cash withdrawals, bank transfers, and crypto-transfers, ’ Europol said in a statement . The Spanish Guardia Civil acted with aid from Europol and law enforcement authorities from Estonia, France, and the USA, to arrest five members of a criminal network linked to investment fraud. The law enforcement performed three searches and arrests on the Canary Islands, and two in Madrid. Europol cracks down on aggressive crypto marketing The recent round of scams was not the usual crypto-native operation. Instead, a network of representatives used phone, email and direct persuasion to sell seemingly lucrative crypto investments. Based on Europol reports, the network had laundered EUR 460M (around $540M) from illicit profits, defrauding over 5,000 victims from the entire world. The network has been under investigation since 2023, as Europol’s financial crime experts assisted Spanish authorities. On the day of the arrests, a crypto specialist was deployed to Spain to assist national investigators. For now, Europol has not provided on-chain data for the type of fraud. The criminal network may have used banking in Hong Kong as well, using payment gateways and user accounts in different names, as well as crypto exchanges to transfer and launder funds. Europe becomes the target for confidence scams While the EU has been relatively favorable for crypto users, scams rely on outsiders who are naive about risks. The current fraud ring is part of the trend for using AI to facilitate the scams. Some of the investment solicitations included personal fraud and gaining the confidence of victims. Similar scams have robbed investors of up to $5.5B on a global scale. Solicitations included deepfakes and advertising promising outsized crypto returns. Spanish authorities are involved in this type of operations for the second time, after breaking up a crime ring in April. The fraud also involved fake platforms that even showed returns and increasing balances. The victims were unable to withdraw their funds, however, or were asked for additional deposits to release the balance. European authorities have warned against trusting the promises for outsized returns, especially if there is a promise of guaranteed earnings. Crypto and stablecoins have been used in some fraud cases, although victims were also solicited to send money via bank accounts, or even through cash withdrawals. European investors have been targeted with investment solicitations even without mentioning cryptocurrencies. Previously, Europol cracked down on fake investments involving renewable energy. The fraud rings use sophisticated research to target their victims with offers. Users have also been persuaded to transfer large sums of money, with solicitations of lucrative renewable energy contracts, entirely unrelated to crypto assets. Most of the rings were discovered after individual complaints and significant personal losses. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

2025-07-01T07:35:07,"Is the Bitcoin Uptrend Over? Analysts See Momentum Waning After 3-Month Surge","The Bitcoin rally, which has lifted prices more than 40% since early April, may be running out of steam as analysts flag weakening momentum and rising profit-taking. Key Takeaways: Bitcoin’s rally momentum is fading as traders who bought below $80,000 take profits. Analysts say Bitcoin’s next move will depend on macro factors like Fed rate decisions. Despite short-term uncertainty, key support levels remain strong, and some experts see potential for a breakout. Bitfinex market strategists said Monday that for the first time during the recent uptrend, “momentum has begun to fade,” citing cooling spot volumes and a slowdown in taker buy pressure. The price of Bitcoin rose from $73,273 on April 9 to $107,380 at publication, but signs now point to possible consolidation or a local top rather than continued explosive gains. Profit-Taking Heats Up as Sub-$80K Bitcoin Buyers Cash Out Traders taking profits, particularly those who bought under $80,000, have intensified selling pressure, according to the analysts. They noted that Bitcoin’s next significant move hinges on macroeconomic drivers and institutional appetite, especially inflows into US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs. These ETFs have attracted net inflows of $4.63 billion over 14 straight trading sessions since June 9, with economist Timothy Peterson calling last week’s $2.2 billion in inflows “massive” and projecting a 70% chance of continued positive flows this week. Bitcoin consolidates between $100K–$110K, with dip buyers defending $98.7K and leverage low. History suggests what’s coming next: Q3 is typically BTC’s weakest quarter, with low volatility and slower moving markets. Will this time be different? https://t.co/pmYnTBWkcY pic.twitter.com/XDaqlp6zci — Bitfinex (@bitfinex) June 30, 2025 Attention is also turning to the Federal Reserve’s July 30 meeting, where markets currently assign a 19% chance of an interest rate cut, based on CME FedWatch data. Lower rates tend to be bullish for risk assets like Bitcoin, adding further weight to the Fed’s decision for short-term price direction. Despite near-term caution, analysts stressed that Bitcoin’s higher time frame structure remains intact, with key support levels holding firm. Meanwhile, some remain optimistic. For one, economist Donald Dean suggested Bitcoin is primed for a breakout following tight consolidation near recent highs. $BTCUSD $BTC Bitcoin – Getting Ready to Move Price Target: $130,981 Bitcoin is getting ready to move higher with tight consolidation at the volume shelf.

Bitcoin Adoption as Treasury Asset Finds Momentum As reported, over the past week, at least nine UK firms, from web design startups to mining businesses, have announced plans to buy Bitcoin or revealed recent purchases to add the cryptocurrency to their corporate treasuries. Among the UK firms, AI services provider Tao Alpha disclosed plans to raise £100 million after revealing a bitcoin treasury plan that triggered investor interest. Smarter Web Company, a small website design firm, saw its market value rocket from £4 million to over £1 billion in just two months after announcing its Bitcoin purchases in April, although shares have since cooled. In the US, Anthony Pompliano’s ProCap BTC acquired 3,724 Bitcoin for $386 million as part of plans to go public through an SPAC merger, while Japan’s Metaplanet raised $517.8 million on the first day of its ambitious “555 Million Plan,” which targets 210,000 Bitcoin by 2027.

This figure pushed the total to $16.9 billion. Interestingly, the mid-year momentum is similar to 2024, when inflows reached $18.3 billion by June’s end. CoinShares noted that continued investor interest is likely tied to a mix of increased geopolitical tensions and the current “uncertainty” around monetary policy, both of which are driving demand for digital assets. Bitcoin Dominates Digital Asset Inflows According to the latest edition of the ‘Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report ,’ Bitcoin captured 83% of total inflows in digital asset investment products last week, as it pulled in $2.2 billion amidst strong investor optimism. Short-Bitcoin products continued to see outflows, with $2.9 million exiting last week, which pushed year-to-date outflows to $12 million. This essentially indicated a positive sentiment around Bitcoin. Ethereum followed suit with $429 million in weekly inflows, as it catapulted its year-to-date total to $2.9 billion, owing to the ongoing bullish investor interest. XRP also secured $10.6 million last week, bringing its yearly inflows to $219 million. While Solana recorded $5.3 million in weekly inflows, its year-to-date tally remains at $91 million. Next up was Sui, which attracted $1.4 million in inflows last week, reaching $4.7 million so far this year. Chainlink and Cardano saw weekly minor inflows of $0.8 million and $0.7 million, respectively, which pushed their year-to-date totals to $24 million and $10 million. Multi-asset products added a modest $0.2 million last week, totaling $58 million in inflows for the year, while Litecoin’s YTD inflows stand at $5 million. Inflows last week were largely driven by the US, which recorded $2.65 billion, while Switzerland and Germany saw smaller inflows of $23 million and $19.8 million. Australia added $8.7 million. In contrast, Sweden saw outflows of $15.9 million, while Canada, Brazil, and Hong Kong recorded outflows of $13.6 million, $2.4 million, and $2.3 million, respectively. Following price rallies, Hong Kong has continued to experience outflows, which reached $132 million for June. Bitcoin Defies June Lull Bitcoin defied its usual June weakness with a last-minute rally, as it caught up to equities after Trump’s $4.5 trillion tax bill advanced in the Senate. According to QCP Capital’s note , the focus has now shifted to today’s vote, aiming for a July 4 deadline. On the institutional side of things, demand remains strong, with spot BTC ETFs seeing $2.2 billion in inflows. Strategy and Metaplanet continued steady accumulation, while leveraged longs increased as the leading crypto approached $108K. Ethereum and Solana rallied on optimism over potential ETH and SOL staking ETFs. However, options markets remain muted, risk reversals also appear to be flat, and implied volatility is near historical lows despite the bullish spot price action.

The prominent financial advisor shared the take in a recent whitepaper for the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals ( DACFP). According to Edelman , who is also DACFP’s founder, the traditional investment model of 60/40 allocation to stock and bond is no longer useful. He attributed this to the massive technological advancements that have led to high longevity rates. Instead, he recommended that investors put their money in crypto while outlining the percentage to allocate based on their risk profiles. In Edelman’s opinion, aggressive investors should have 40% of their crypto investments, while conservative ones should have 10%. He said: “Conservative investors should now have a 10% crypto allocation. Moderate clients should place 25% of their portfolios in crypto, and aggressive clients should allocate 40% of their investments to crypto.” Interestingly, the veteran investor with 39 years of experience in the financial sector noted that investing in crypto is no longer a speculative trade. According to him, a passive market-weighted index of all asset classes would have 3% allocated to crypto, showing just how big the sector has become. Thus, anyone choosing to ignore the crypto sector is simply shorting it. Edelman bullish on crypto, says Bitcoin could reach $500,000 Meanwhile, Edelman made a bullish case for investors to allocate up to 40% of their portfolio to crypto. According to him, there is no reason anyone would choose to ignore an asset class that has outperformed the rest of the market for 15 consecutive years. In backing up his claim, he highlighted high-performing crypto assets and sectors, including the stablecoin sector. He noted that Tether’s massive $13 billion profits last year exceeded what several major US companies, including McDonald’s, BlackRock, IBM, and Ford, pulled in. Edelman’s summary of why everyone should invest in crypto (Source: DACFP) Beyond that, Edelman believes President Donald Trump’s win in 2024 has also set the stage for crypto’s good fortunes. According to him, the pro-crypto moves from the Trump administration and policy reversal from individuals and institutions are all signs that crypto is now a derisked investment. Unsurprisingly, the prominent financial advisor is particularly bullish on Bitcoin and has predicted it could be worth $500,000, noting that this is based on demand and supply. He noted that institutions’ massive accumulation of assets will continue to drive up their prices. He said: “There’s $750 trillion in global assets (stocks, bonds, real estate, gold, cash and collectibles). A mere 1% allocation would cause $7.5 trillion to flow into Bitcoin. That’s $377,000 per bitcoin. Add that to Bitcoin’s current price, and you get to about $500,000 per Bitcoin. It’s simple arithmetic.” Interestingly, Edelman highlighted how investors can get crypto exposure, from direct acquisition to equity proxies. His whitepaper also advises financial advisors to allocate part of their portfolio to crypto by including responses to clients’ common objections and criticizing advisors who do not recommend crypto to their customers. Reactions trail Edelman’s endorsement of crypto allocation Meanwhile, the whitepaper from Edelman has sparked a mixed but mostly positive reaction from experts. Bloomberg senior analyst Eric Balchunas described it as the biggest endorsement of crypto from TradFi since BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. According to him, this is because of Edelman’s status in the financial advisory community, where he is one of the most influential voices. He said: “This guy is Mr RIA. Manages $300b for 1.3 million clients. Tops the Barron’s list of America Advisors regularly.” Meanwhile, some in the crypto community believe that Edelman should have specified BTC as the asset to invest in rather than simply saying crypto. Balchunas noted that this should not be a cause for debate, as almost all investors, including Edelman, acknowledge that Bitcoin is the primary investment asset in the crypto sector. Interestingly, Bitwise European head of research André Dragosh does not agree that technological advancements killed the 60/40 model. Instead, he attributes it to rising inflation, noting that stocks and bonds underperform once inflation rises above 5%. However, he also recommended diversifying into hard assets such as Gold and Bitcoin. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

He added that owning crypto is no longer a speculative position, but “failing to do so is.” The founder of the $300 billion investment advisory firm, Edelman Financial Engines, made the dramatic recommendation suggesting that aggressive investors should hold up to 40% of their assets in crypto, 25% for moderate, while conservative investors should allocate 10%. You need to plan on living past 100, and that means you need more than stocks and bonds. My new white paper explains why you’ll get to 100+ and why your portfolio should include 10% to 40% crypto. Read it now: https://t.co/hfjCMvQC3J pic.twitter.com/pZgJs79GdZ — Ric Edelman (@ricedelman) June 30, 2025 10/10 on The Wow Scale A passive market-weighted index comprised of all asset classes would have 3% in crypto, “so an investor who lacks crypto is now effectively shorting it,” he said. “There’s no logic to omitting an asset class that’s outperformed all others for 15 consecutive years and is widely projected to continue doing so for the next decade or more. ​​Historic performance data show that portfolios with Bitcoin have generated higher returns with lower risks.” Edelman , who has been named America’s top Independent Financial Advisor by Barron’s three times, said to other financial advisors, “If you’re fearful that recommending crypto could cause a client to fire you, then you’re suffering from a conflict of interest.” “This is ten out of ten on the wow scale,” exclaimed Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, who added: “This is arguably the most important full-throated endorsement of crypto from the TradFi world since Larry Fink.” “40% is wild for most normies!” exclaimed entrepreneur Adam Cochran, while industry pioneer Adam Back and other Bitcoin maximalists grumbled at the usage of the term crypto rather than just Bitcoin. Institutions Driving Markets Edelman’s recommendation comes as institutional adoption accelerates, with over $20 billion invested in spot Bitcoin ETFs by wealthy investors and institutions, and more than 70 crypto ETF proposals pending with the SEC. The finance guru also cited the Trump administration’s regulatory reversal, the growth of stablecoins, and basic supply-demand dynamics supporting his bullish outlook, even suggesting Bitcoin could reach $500,000. Institutional investors and corporations have been scooping up all of the Bitcoin that long-term holders have been selling, which is why prices have stagnated recently. However, “Bitcoin’s price appreciation isn’t speculation — it’s just supply and demand,” concluded Edelman.

2025-07-01T07:08:45,"FTX Reveals Next Repayment Date to Fully Compensate Large Creditors","FTX creditor representative Sunil Kavuri has provided a new update on the next distribution of claim payments to creditors of the defunct crypto exchange. Recall that FTX commenced the distribution of funds to eligible users on February 18, 2025, starting with small creditors with claims under $50,000. According to Kavuri, FTX paid creditors in this category (those entitled to claims under $50,000) 120% of their initial claim value. This indicates that creditors received a 20% premium on their original claim value. Afterward, FTX commenced the second round of repayments on May 30, 2025, distributing $5 billion to creditors with claims over $50,000. The exchange distributed the funds within three business days of May 30. However, creditors with claims exceeding $50,000 received only 72.5% of their initial claim value. Next Payment Schedule Notably, Kavuri has disclosed the next repayment date for the remaining 27.5% of claims to large creditors. According to him, the upcoming distribution is expected to take place in Q4 2025, specifically from October to December. Additionally, he suggested that the repayment schedule could be extended to 2026 or 2027. This repayment will ensure that creditors with claims exceeding $50,000 receive 100% of their claim. Besides the claim value, these large creditors are also entitled to post-petition interest, which totals 40% to 80%. https://twitter.com/sunil_trades/status/1939692898154369096FTX's Epic Collapse and Repayment EffortsThis ongoing repayment schedule comes more than two years after FTX's collapse in November 2022. The exchange declared bankruptcy, with key executives sentenced to several years in prison. Specifically, a federal court in New York sentenced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) to 25 years in prison due to his role in mismanaging users' funds, leading to the exchange’s downfall. The court subsequently sentenced other executives, including Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison and FTX Digital Markets CEO Ryan Salame, to two and seven-and-a-half-year jail terms, respectively. Since the epic failure of FTX, the exchange has been working to reimburse users, with repayments commencing earlier this year. Despite FTX’s efforts, many have criticized the disbursement process for valuing users’ claims at token prices as of the time of the bankruptcy filing in late 2022. It is worth noting that crypto prices have soared significantly ever since. For instance, Bitcoin, which traded around $20,000 in late 2022, has rallied more than 400% to over $100,000.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/07/01/ftx-reveals-next-repayment-date-to-fully-compensate-large-creditors/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ftx-reveals-next-repayment-date-to-fully-compensate-large-creditors,"EXCHANGE|MARKET|BTC|BUSINESS|RESEARCH","Market|Latest Crypto Exchanges News|Latest FTX News Market Updates",cryptocompare

The group will enable private clients to trade cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), directly through their mobile banking apps via the group's securities platform, DekaBank, with the facility expected to go live by summer 2026. The news comes months after DekaBank introduced crypto trading and custody services for institutional clients and represents the growing acceptance of digital assets within traditional banking systems. The German Savings Bank Association (DSGV) reportedly backed the decision to enable crypto trading, citing growing demand and the prevalence of legal framework under the so-called European MiCAR Regulation. Earlier this year, Matthias Diessl, president of the Savings Banks in Bavaria, said in a Bloomberg interview that savings banks should offer customers the opportunity to trade cryptocurrencies, deviating from a three-year-old committee recommendation cautioning against enabling crypto trading. That said, despite warming up to the idea, DGSV still considers digital assets as highly speculative investments, according to Bloomberg.

2025-07-01T07:04:10,"Lawsuit Alleges Citibank Ignored Red Flags, Aided Scammers in $20,000,000 Pig Butchering Romance Scam","A Texas man is suing the financial giant Citibank for allegedly enabling scammers in a $20 million pig butchering scheme. Pig butchering scams typically involve scammers gaining the trust of victims over time to convince them to invest digital assets or cash into fraudulent websites that they control. Michael B. Zidell says in newly filed court documents that he was contacted on Facebook in early 2023 by someone claiming to be a California business owner named Carolyn Parker. Zidell says he perceived a romantic relationship developing with Parker, who told him that she had invested in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on a website called “OpenrarityPro.com” and made millions of dollars in investment gains. Zidell sent 43 wire transfers totalling $20 million to different accounts to “make a market” for NFTs on OpenarirtyPro.com as Parker had instructed. Of those, 12 transfers worth nearly $4 million were sent to one Citibank account called Guju, Inc. A month or so after Zidell started investing, OpenrarityPro.com displayed his account as being worth more than $300 million, but when he tried to withdraw some of the funds, he was told he’d have to send more money to cover a “risk deposit,” according to the court documents. In late April, the OpenrarityPro.com website disappeared, and Zidell began to suspect he was the victim of fraud. Zidell’s lawyers argue in the court documents that Citibank didn’t exercise thorough due diligence on the Guju account. “In the account opening documents for Defendant Citibank’s accounts for Guju, Inc., their customer states that it will receive no wire transfers, and the total value of the wires it would out would be less than $250,000 per month. In fact, the wires they say they will send are $8,000 transfers to China. The reality was obviously different. The account received no less than twelve (12) wires from Plaintiffs and dozens from others. Some of the outbound wires exceeded $2,000,000.00. Even worse, the account stated an annual gross revenue of $300,000 and Guju received more than 12 times that amount from Plaintiffs alone in two weeks. The first wire from Plaintiffs exceeded Guju’s stated annual revenue by almost 50%.” Zidell’s lawyers also argue Citibank operated recklessly and provided “substantial assistance” to Parker and her co-conspirators by opening bank accounts and providing services. “Defendant is liable as an aider and abettor as it, directly or indirectly, knew of the tortious conduct of the NFT Enterprise because the transactions at issue expressly contradicted the account opening documents and violated… ‘red flags.’ Defendant materially aided the seller or issuer of a security and are, therefore, jointly and severally liable with the seller or issuer and to the same extent as the seller or issuer.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
