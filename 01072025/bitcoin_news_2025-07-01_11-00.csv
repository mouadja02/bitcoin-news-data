2025-07-01T08:48:49,"German Banking Giant Sparkassen to Launch Bitcoin, Ether Trading in Banking Apps by 2026","Germany’s Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe plans to launch crypto trading for its 50 million customers by summer 2026, marking a major turnaround for the country’s largest banking group. Key Takeaways: Sparkassen will launch crypto trading for 50 million customers by summer 2026. Dekabank will manage the new service, enabling Bitcoin and Ether trades directly in Sparkassen’s app. The move signals growing momentum among German banks to integrate crypto. According to Bloomberg , Dekabank, owned by Sparkassen, will oversee the crypto offering through the group’s mobile banking app, enabling direct trading of Bitcoin and Ether. The German Savings Banks Association (DSGV) confirmed the move, stating it will provide customers with “reliable access to a regulated crypto offering,” now allowed under the EU’s MiCA framework, which took effect in December. Sparkassen Reverses Course After 2015 Crypto Ban Over Volatility Fears Sparkassen’s leadership had previously rejected crypto services due to volatility concerns and even blocked crypto purchases for all customers in 2015. While the group has changed course, the DSGV stressed its caution, labeling cryptocurrencies “highly speculative investments” and promising no marketing campaigns for the new feature. Customers will instead receive detailed information about risks, including the chance of total losses. Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe spans more than 500 financial institutions, including over 370 savings banks, and manages over €2.5 trillion ($2.9 trillion) in assets, giving the crypto initiative significant potential reach. Industry voices have welcomed the move. ERA Labs CEO Filipp Bolotov called it a “big move for mainstream adoption,” while Master Ventures’ Kyle Chasse said it shows banks are “catching up” to crypto’s evolution. BREAKING: GERMANY’S TOP BANK GROUP SPARKASSEN TO OFFER RETAIL CRYPTO TRADING BY 2026. THE BANKS ARE CATCHING UP!!! pic.twitter.com/rrykogR1Tl — Kyle Chassé / DD (@kyle_chasse) June 30, 2025 Other major German banks have already begun integrating crypto services. DZ Bank, Germany’s second-largest lender, partnered with Boerse Stuttgart Digital last year to pilot crypto trading and custody services, aiming to expand offerings across its 700 cooperative banks after initial trials. Meanwhile, Landesbank Baden-Württemberg, the country’s biggest federal bank, announced plans in April 2024 to provide crypto custody services for institutional clients in collaboration with Bitpanda. The momentum isn’t limited to Germany. Speaking in April, Eric Trump warned that banks resisting crypto could become obsolete within a decade, highlighting issues of speed and cost in traditional finance. And during Paris Blockchain Week, Messari’s Eric Turner and Sygnum Bank’s Thomas Eichenberger predicted a deeper push by banks into crypto services later this year as regulatory clarity improves. Ric Edelman Urges Advisors to Allocate Up to 40% to Crypto As reported, veteran advisor Ric Edelman is calling for crypto allocations of up to 40% in investment portfolios, a dramatic jump from his earlier 1% guidance. He told CNBC that questions around government bans and institutional adoption have been resolved, making crypto a mainstream asset. Edelman pointed to strong inflows into Bitcoin ETFs as evidence of crypto’s acceptance among investors and advisors. He said the traditional 60/40 stock-bond portfolio no longer suits today’s longer life expectancies, requiring strategies with higher return potential. Edelman also pointed out crypto’s uncorrelated performance with traditional assets, arguing that it can provide essential diversification and boost risk-adjusted returns.

Specifically, the number of large Bitcoin transactions exceeding $100,000 has decreased by 45.3% over the past month. The transactions peaked at around 30,840 on May 22 but fell to just 16,860 by June 29, according to data from the crypto analytics platform IntoTheBlock . Bitcoin whale transaction data. Source: IntoTheBlock The steep decline often signals reduced activity from whales and institutions. This drop indicates potential weakening confidence and thinning liquidity, which increases the risk of Bitcoin slipping below the key $100,000 support level . If large-scale buying continues to wane, the market could face deeper volatility unless new demand emerges. Capital inflow into crypto plunges $20 billion At the same time, broader cryptocurrency market trends echo this caution. Capital inflows into cryptocurrencies have declined by more than $20 billion, suggesting a shift in investor sentiment. Glassnode data shows the net position change in realized value, a measure of capital entering or exiting the market, dropped from nearly $55 billion in late May to $34 billion by June 28. Crypto market realized value change. Source: Glassnode This drawdown highlights a slowdown in momentum across major assets, including Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH ), both of which had experienced steady accumulation earlier in the second quarter. Bitcoin price analysis Currently, Bitcoin’s key support level is at $105,000. Holding above this level is critical for any attempt to reclaim $110,000 and push toward new all-time highs . As of press time, BTC was trading at $106,972, down 0.6% on the day and 0.3% for the week. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Technically, Bitcoin remains in a bullish posture.

Meanwhile, the 14-day RSI stands at 58.77, indicating that momentum remains intact without signaling overbought conditions.

2025-07-01T08:40:08,"Why Did Bitcoin's Rise Stop? Is There a Possibility of a New Rally for BTC? Bitfinex Analysts Explained!","As the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) continues its sideways trend, investors are eagerly waiting for a major rally to come. However, Bitfinex analysts said the Bitcoin rally was losing momentum as profit-taking increased and volume decreased. Uptrend Momentum Weakening! Bitcoin’s nearly three-month rally appears to be losing momentum as buying pressure weakens and profit-taking intensifies, Bitfinex analysts said. Although BTC has surged 40% from its April lows to above $107,000, analysts argued that the market has entered a consolidation phase rather than continuing its sharp uptrend. Analysts claimed that falling Bitcoin spot volume is entering a period of consolidation rather than sustained bullish momentum and could signal a local top. As Bitcoin loses its upward momentum, analysts said that BTC's next move will depend on macro factors and institutional demand, especially from ETF inflows. “For the first time in Bitcoin’s nearly three-month-old uptrend, momentum has begun to fade. Spot trading volume cooled, buyers' buying pressure weakened, and profit taking intensified. The selling is particularly concentrated among short-term investors who are evaluating the move from levels below $80,000. At this point, Bitcoin's bullish momentum remains dependent on ETF inflows and macro factors.” Despite the short-term uncertainty in Bitcoin at this point, analysts said that the longer-term bullish structure remains strong and said, “Current data points to a transition phase.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-01T08:30:14,"Analyst Calls For Bitcoin Crash As Price Pulls Above $108,000 — Details","The past weekend was favorable for Bitcoin as the price was able to rebound from last week’s lows and go on to reclaim $108,000 ahead of the new week. This has boosted market sentiment once again, prompting investors to return to the table. However, as the price continues to sit in the green, one crypto analyst has sounded the alarm that the Bitcoin price may be headed for another crash toward the support area close to $100,000. Why A Bitcoin Price Crash Is Imminent In the TradingView analysis, the crypto analyst reveals the reason why the Bitcoin price could dump back downwards is because of mounting resistance. This is because, as the leading cryptocurrency moves toward new all-time highs, there is the possibility of a pushback before it is able to continue its rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidating Below $108,000 But Eyes $115,000 Target In this case, the crypto analyst does expect the Bitcoin price to keep rising. But they see a lot of resistance for the digital asset just above $109,000. More specifically, at $109,500, which is still a ways away from the $112,000 needed to create a new all-time high, the cryptocurrency is expected to meet new resistance and dump back downward. This stiff resistance opens up an opportunity for market shooters to enter into the trade. According to the chart, it is possible for the Bitcoin price to actually move toward the low $100,000s. Currently, there is major support at $102,500, and if the digital asset does lose its footing, this is likely where the bulls will stage their recovery once more. Sweeping For Liquidity At Lower Ranges Another crypto analyst, Riscora, has supported this move with their own analysis, also predicting that a pullback is possible from here. This still boils down to mounting resistance as the Bitcoin price moves toward the possibility of reaching a new all-time high, and budding liquidity rises at the lower levels. Related Reading: TD Sequential Flashes Buy: Dogecoin Ready For Rebound To $0.21 The analyst explains that as liquidity has now been taken in the higher levels, after Bitcoin hit $108,000, there is bound to be a correction. This time around, they expect the correction to be much deeper given the recent bullish impulse move. The target from her sis a move back into the $107,000 territory, before moving further downward to take on the $106,400 support. Despite the expectation of a price dip, the analyst warns that the Bitcoin price remains overall bullish from here. As the crypto market ushers in the month of July, which is usually bullish for Bitcoin, it is possible that the cryptocurrency does put in a new all-time high this month, seeing as there is less than a 5% move left to beat its current $111,900 peak.

2025-07-01T08:21:59,"Bitcoin, Ethereum & XRP Price Prediction for July 2025","The post Bitcoin, Ethereum & XRP Price Prediction for July 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market cap today has nudged up 0.42% to $3.3 trillion, reflecting a cautiously optimistic stance from investors. The Fear & Greed Index stands at 50, signaling neutrality after a month of volatility. While trading volume rose by 13.08% to $99.85 billion, key assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum remain range-bound. XRP, on the other hand, is seeing renewed traction ahead of a pivotal SEC meeting and a major tech upgrade. In this analysis, we will explore where BTC, ETH, and XRP are heading in July. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction Bitcoin is currently trading at $106,912, with intraday movement limited between $106,759 and $107,971. Despite a slight -0.65% dip, sentiment remains neutral. Notably, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF has surpassed $72 billion in AUM, highlighting growing institutional interest even as retail participation flattens. From a technical standpoint, Bitcoin continues to consolidate between $104,000 and $110,000, forming a potential accumulation pattern. If BTC sustains support above $106,000 and volume picks up, a move toward $113,000, followed by $120,000, is on the cards. However, failure to maintain the current range could expose BTC to a minor pullback toward $101,500. Also read our Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030 for long-term targets! Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction Ethereum is showing signs of internal strength, trading flat at $2,462. Price action remains within the range of $2,438–$2,521, but a fast-declining exchange supply, now at 17.1 million ETH, suggests investors are moving tokens off centralized platforms in anticipation of future gains. The narrowing price range and dwindling supply typically signal a breakout brewing. A push above $2,550 could open up a run toward $2,650, while failure to hold $2,420 could invite a short-term correction back to $2,200. The bias remains cautiously bullish as long as on-chain data supports accumulation. Check out our Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! Ripple XRP Price Prediction XRP is up nearly 2% at $2.22, riding momentum from the announcement of an EVM-compatible sidechain launch and a critical Ripple vs SEC meeting scheduled for July 3. These developments have created renewed enthusiasm in the community, as evidenced by a healthy $4.05B in daily volume. Technically speaking, XRP is holding above the $2.17 support zone. If bullish momentum persists and positive news comes from the SEC front, XRP could test the $2.35 resistance, and possibly aim for $2.80 in an extended rally. Which could also stretch to $3. However, any delay or unfavorable outcome could drag XRP back toward the $2.15 level. Read our Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! FAQs Will Bitcoin hit a new ATH in July 2025? It is likely if, BTC breaks above $112k with strong volume. For now, the trend remains sideways. Is Ethereum’s shrinking exchange supply bullish?

Bitcoin is trading just below $108k while Ether looks set to hit the $2,500 mark once again. The week promises to be an interesting one, with traders keeping an eye on macroeconomic data such as the May job openings, the Labor Turnover Survey, as well as June nonfarm payrolls and the unemployment rate. Furthermore, traders are also turning their attention to tomorrow’s speech by Jerome Powell at an ECB forum panel alongside central bank governors from the UK, South Korea, and Japan. While Bitcoin and Ether will take center stage, Ripple’s XRP is another coin that will be in the mix. XRP could rally higher this week amid strong fundamental and technical indicators. XRP to rally higher as SEC-Ripple case approaches conclusion XRP, the native coin of the Ripple ecosystem, could be one of the best performers over the next few days. Its rally could be fueled by the ongoing case between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On Friday, Ripple Labs’ CEO Brad Garlinghouse revealed that the company is dropping its appeal against the regulator in a prolonged legal battle tied to the sale of its XRP tokens. The announcement is set to bring the dispute closer to resolution after years of back-and-forth between the company and the regulator. The two sides agreed to settle if the judge set aside her injunction and approved lowering the $125 million fine she had imposed on Ripple. While the judge rejected their request, market participants anticipate that the case is now closer to its end. Ending the case will be beneficial to Ripple Labs as it would allow the company to focus on its products, especially its recently launched stablecoin, RLUSD. This could benefit XRP as investors can purchase the tokens without the fear of regarding it as a security. XRP is on the verge of a bullish breakout The XRP/USD 4-hour chart is bearish, but technical indicators show that the pair is reversing this situation. XRP added 7% to its value over the last seven days and now trades around $2.18 per coin. The MACD lines are within the positive territory, suggesting a bullish scenario for the cryptocurrency. Furthermore, the RSI of 58 indicates a fading bearish momentum for the pair. At press time, XRP is approaching its key resistance at $2.23. If the coin breaks and closes above this resistance level, it could extend the rally and hit the next major resistance level at $2.47. If XRP breaks and closes above its daily resistance at $2.23, it could extend the rally toward its May 23 high of $2.47. However, for the bullish momentum to be sustained, the RSI must enter the overbought region while the MACD lines remain in the bullish zone. On the flipside, if the bearish trend strengthens, XRP could extend the correction to retest its daily support at $1.90.

CertiK recorded 344 on-chain incidents between January and June. Wallet breaches accounted for $1.7 billion in just 34 cases, while phishing scams caused $410 million across 132 incidents.

In May, Cetus Protocol was exploited for $225 million via a smart contract bug, although $162 million was later recovered by Sui validators. Ethereum Targeted Most; Code Bugs Surge Ethereum was the most attacked blockchain, with 175 incidents leading to $1.6 billion in losses. Smart contract vulnerabilities alone caused $229 million in May, up sharply from just $5 million in April. CertiK also flagged an increase in physical attacks, with 32 cases involving violence, kidnappings, and ransom attempts. France saw the most incidents, including an attempted kidnapping involving the family of Paymium’s CEO.

2025-07-01T08:01:08,"Donald Trump Made His New Move Concerning Memecoin TRUMP!","While Donald Trump continues to come to the fore with his support for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, he has made a new move regarding his own token, Official Trump (TRUMP). At this point, Trump has investments in various cryptocurrencies and they have also started to be used as a payment option. First, many marketplaces selling Donald Trump-branded products, such as GetTrumpWatches.com, GetTrumpFragrances.com, and GetTrumpSneakers.com, announced that they have started accepting payments in Bitcoin (BTC) and TRUMP, in addition to credit cards. With a new move made afterwards, the TRUMP payment network was expanded. According to the new statement made by the GetTrumpMemes X account, the TRUMP token is now accepted in official product stores. GetTrumpMemes has announced that TRUMP token holders can now use the TRUMP cryptocurrency to shop at official Trump merchandise stores. The post included links to three separate online stores selling TRUMP-themed perfumes, sneakers, and watches. These items can now be purchased using TRUMP.

2025-07-01T08:00:40,"Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Selling, But Price Holds – New Buyers Stepping In?","Bitcoin (BTC) has remained range-bound between $100,000 and $110,000 since May, offering few clues about its next directional move. While this sideways price action may be frustrating traders, on-chain indicators suggest there may be more happening beneath the surface. Long-Term Holders Are Selling Bitcoin According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Yonsei_dent, long-term holders (LTHs) – those who have held BTC for more than six months – have been consistently selling their coins. Two key indicators, the Spent Output Age Bands (SOAB) and Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD), support this observation. For the uninitiated, SOAB is an on-chain metric that tracks the age of Bitcoin being spent, categorizing coins based on how long they were held before being moved. It helps identify whether short-term or long-term holders are currently active, revealing shifts in investor behavior and broader market trends. Similarly, Binary CDD is a simplified on-chain metric that shows whether LTHs spent any coins on a given day – represented as a binary “yes” (1) or “no” (0). Unlike traditional CDD, it focuses solely on the presence or absence of LTH activity, making it easier to spot trend changes in long-term holder behavior. What’s notable, according to Yonsei_dent, is that despite this steady selling by LTHs, BTC’s price has not broken down. The fact that the market is absorbing this selling pressure suggests that new demand – possibly from fresh buyers – is stepping in. The analyst added: For a bullish trend to sustain, this kind of healthy rotation (from strong hands to new buyers) is essential. In that context, LTH spending isn’t a warning sign – it’s actually a constructive signal. In addition, there’s rising activity from holders who acquired BTC one to three years ago. This likely reflects profit-taking by those who bought during previous cycle lows. That said, such selling does not necessarily indicate weakness. On the contrary, it suggests a transition in market leadership from older to newer holders – a dynamic typically seen in the mid-to-late stages of a bull market. In conclusion, Yonsei_dent believes that the crypto market is likely in a phase of “quiet redistribution,” where LTH selling is being matched by sufficient buy-side demand – potentially setting the stage for the next strong move. Not All Analysts Are Optimistic Despite the constructive signals from SOAB and Binary CDD, not all analysts are convinced of a near-term breakout. For example, the Bitcoin MVRV ratio is showing signs of bull market fatigue. Likewise, even after the recent price rebound, Bitcoin network activity remains significantly muted – raising concerns about a broader lack of user engagement. At press time, BTC trades at $107,781, down 0.1% over the past 24 hours.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-long-term-holders-selling-but-price-holds-new-buyers-stepping-in/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Bitcoin News|Binary Coin Days Destroyed|bitcoin|Bitcoin Binary CDD|Bitcoin SOAB|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|on-chain analysis|Spent Output Age Bands",cryptocompare
2025-07-01T07:54:47,"Crypto lost to hacks and scams in H1 2025 tops 2024 total at $2.5B: CertiK","Nearly $2.5 billion worth of cryptocurrencies were stolen across 290 incidents in the first half of 2025, surpassing total losses recorded in 2024. According to CertiK’s latest Hack3d report shared with crypto.news, compromised wallets accounted for the largest share of losses, totalling over $1.7 billion across 34 incidents. Phishing attacks followed, siphoning more than $410 million in 132 cases, while code vulnerabilities led to losses exceeding $283 million across 114 incidents. Exit scams and price manipulation were less frequent during this period but were still notable, resulting in combined losses of nearly $20 million. Access control exploits accounted for $42 million in damages. Notably, total losses in the first six months of 2025 have already surpassed the $2.42 billion recorded for all of 2024. After adjusting for returned and frozen funds, net losses stand at $2.29 billion, exceeding last year’s adjusted total of $1.98 billion. A significant portion of this year’s losses, roughly 72%, or $1.78 billion, stemmed from two large-scale incidents, the Bybit hack in Q1 and the Cetus protocol exploit in Q2. Excluding these, H1 losses would have stood at around $690 million.

While the pace of attacks slowed significantly in the second quarter, several major incidents still contributed to substantial losses. Phishing was the most widespread attack vector in Q2, accounting for over $395 million in losses across 52 incidents. Code vulnerabilities and access control weaknesses followed, resulting in losses of $235.7 million and $36.1 million, respectively. Wallet compromises, which had dominated Q1, caused $112 million in losses from 9 incidents in Q2. While the Bybit breach remained the most damaging incident of the year, Q2 saw several other high-value breaches involving protocol exploits and infrastructure compromises. These included the $225.6 million exploit of Cetus, the $89.1 million hack of Iran’s Nobitex exchange, and a $16.1 million attack on ALEX Lab. Other incidents involving Bitopro, Cork Protocol , KiloEx , and zkSync-based projects were primarily the result of smart contract flaws, infrastructure breaches, or compromised wallets. Ethereum was the most targeted blockchain, suffering losses of more than $1.58 billion across 164 incidents, while Bitcoin came in second, with over $373 million lost across 10 incidents. CertiK noted that $187 million in stolen funds were returned in the first half of the year, bringing the adjusted total losses to just over $2.28 billion. Of this, $180 million was recovered in Q2 alone. As previously reported by crypto.news, a separate mid-year analysis by blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs estimated $2.1 billion in crypto losses across 75 incidents during the same period, with the majority linked to infrastructure-level breaches such as private key thefts and front-end hijacks.

2025-07-01T07:45:49,"The Spanish police cracked down on a crypto-related fraud ring","Europol announced the organized arrests of a criminal network connected to cryptocurrency investment fraud. The network involved teams in Spain, France, Estonia, as well as the USA. Europol cracked down on a network spreading crypto-related investment fraud. The scammers operated in Spain, France, Estonia, as well as the USA. Law enforcement arranged a series of arrests at the end of June. ‘ To carry out their fraudulent activities, the leaders of the criminal network allegedly used a net of associates spread around the world to raise funds through cash withdrawals, bank transfers, and crypto-transfers, ’ Europol said in a statement . The Spanish Guardia Civil acted with aid from Europol and law enforcement authorities from Estonia, France, and the USA, to arrest five members of a criminal network linked to investment fraud. The law enforcement performed three searches and arrests on the Canary Islands, and two in Madrid. Europol cracks down on aggressive crypto marketing The recent round of scams was not the usual crypto-native operation. Instead, a network of representatives used phone, email and direct persuasion to sell seemingly lucrative crypto investments. Based on Europol reports, the network had laundered EUR 460M (around $540M) from illicit profits, defrauding over 5,000 victims from the entire world. The network has been under investigation since 2023, as Europol’s financial crime experts assisted Spanish authorities. On the day of the arrests, a crypto specialist was deployed to Spain to assist national investigators. For now, Europol has not provided on-chain data for the type of fraud. The criminal network may have used banking in Hong Kong as well, using payment gateways and user accounts in different names, as well as crypto exchanges to transfer and launder funds. Europe becomes the target for confidence scams While the EU has been relatively favorable for crypto users, scams rely on outsiders who are naive about risks. The current fraud ring is part of the trend for using AI to facilitate the scams. Some of the investment solicitations included personal fraud and gaining the confidence of victims. Similar scams have robbed investors of up to $5.5B on a global scale. Solicitations included deepfakes and advertising promising outsized crypto returns. Spanish authorities are involved in this type of operations for the second time, after breaking up a crime ring in April. The fraud also involved fake platforms that even showed returns and increasing balances. The victims were unable to withdraw their funds, however, or were asked for additional deposits to release the balance. European authorities have warned against trusting the promises for outsized returns, especially if there is a promise of guaranteed earnings. Crypto and stablecoins have been used in some fraud cases, although victims were also solicited to send money via bank accounts, or even through cash withdrawals. European investors have been targeted with investment solicitations even without mentioning cryptocurrencies. Previously, Europol cracked down on fake investments involving renewable energy. The fraud rings use sophisticated research to target their victims with offers. Users have also been persuaded to transfer large sums of money, with solicitations of lucrative renewable energy contracts, entirely unrelated to crypto assets. Most of the rings were discovered after individual complaints and significant personal losses.

2025-07-01T07:35:07,"Is the Bitcoin Uptrend Over? Analysts See Momentum Waning After 3-Month Surge","The Bitcoin rally, which has lifted prices more than 40% since early April, may be running out of steam as analysts flag weakening momentum and rising profit-taking. Key Takeaways: Bitcoin’s rally momentum is fading as traders who bought below $80,000 take profits. Analysts say Bitcoin’s next move will depend on macro factors like Fed rate decisions. Despite short-term uncertainty, key support levels remain strong, and some experts see potential for a breakout. Bitfinex market strategists said Monday that for the first time during the recent uptrend, “momentum has begun to fade,” citing cooling spot volumes and a slowdown in taker buy pressure. The price of Bitcoin rose from $73,273 on April 9 to $107,380 at publication, but signs now point to possible consolidation or a local top rather than continued explosive gains. Profit-Taking Heats Up as Sub-$80K Bitcoin Buyers Cash Out Traders taking profits, particularly those who bought under $80,000, have intensified selling pressure, according to the analysts. They noted that Bitcoin’s next significant move hinges on macroeconomic drivers and institutional appetite, especially inflows into US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs. These ETFs have attracted net inflows of $4.63 billion over 14 straight trading sessions since June 9, with economist Timothy Peterson calling last week’s $2.2 billion in inflows “massive” and projecting a 70% chance of continued positive flows this week. Bitcoin consolidates between $100K–$110K, with dip buyers defending $98.7K and leverage low. History suggests what’s coming next: Q3 is typically BTC’s weakest quarter, with low volatility and slower moving markets. Will this time be different? https://t.co/pmYnTBWkcY pic.twitter.com/XDaqlp6zci — Bitfinex (@bitfinex) June 30, 2025 Attention is also turning to the Federal Reserve’s July 30 meeting, where markets currently assign a 19% chance of an interest rate cut, based on CME FedWatch data. Lower rates tend to be bullish for risk assets like Bitcoin, adding further weight to the Fed’s decision for short-term price direction. Despite near-term caution, analysts stressed that Bitcoin’s higher time frame structure remains intact, with key support levels holding firm. Meanwhile, some remain optimistic. For one, economist Donald Dean suggested Bitcoin is primed for a breakout following tight consolidation near recent highs. $BTCUSD $BTC Bitcoin – Getting Ready to Move Price Target: $130,981 Bitcoin is getting ready to move higher with tight consolidation at the volume shelf.

Bitcoin Adoption as Treasury Asset Finds Momentum As reported, over the past week, at least nine UK firms, from web design startups to mining businesses, have announced plans to buy Bitcoin or revealed recent purchases to add the cryptocurrency to their corporate treasuries. Among the UK firms, AI services provider Tao Alpha disclosed plans to raise £100 million after revealing a bitcoin treasury plan that triggered investor interest. Smarter Web Company, a small website design firm, saw its market value rocket from £4 million to over £1 billion in just two months after announcing its Bitcoin purchases in April, although shares have since cooled. In the US, Anthony Pompliano’s ProCap BTC acquired 3,724 Bitcoin for $386 million as part of plans to go public through an SPAC merger, while Japan’s Metaplanet raised $517.8 million on the first day of its ambitious “555 Million Plan,” which targets 210,000 Bitcoin by 2027.

2025-07-01T07:31:20,"Bitcoin Claims 83% of Weekly Crypto Inflows As Digital Asset Funds Extend Positive Streak to 11 Weeks","Digital asset funds experienced inflows of $2.7 billion last week, their 11th consecutive week of gains. This figure pushed the total to $16.9 billion. Interestingly, the mid-year momentum is similar to 2024, when inflows reached $18.3 billion by June’s end. CoinShares noted that continued investor interest is likely tied to a mix of increased geopolitical tensions and the current “uncertainty” around monetary policy, both of which are driving demand for digital assets. Bitcoin Dominates Digital Asset Inflows According to the latest edition of the ‘Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report ,’ Bitcoin captured 83% of total inflows in digital asset investment products last week, as it pulled in $2.2 billion amidst strong investor optimism. Short-Bitcoin products continued to see outflows, with $2.9 million exiting last week, which pushed year-to-date outflows to $12 million. This essentially indicated a positive sentiment around Bitcoin. Ethereum followed suit with $429 million in weekly inflows, as it catapulted its year-to-date total to $2.9 billion, owing to the ongoing bullish investor interest. XRP also secured $10.6 million last week, bringing its yearly inflows to $219 million. While Solana recorded $5.3 million in weekly inflows, its year-to-date tally remains at $91 million. Next up was Sui, which attracted $1.4 million in inflows last week, reaching $4.7 million so far this year. Chainlink and Cardano saw weekly minor inflows of $0.8 million and $0.7 million, respectively, which pushed their year-to-date totals to $24 million and $10 million. Multi-asset products added a modest $0.2 million last week, totaling $58 million in inflows for the year, while Litecoin’s YTD inflows stand at $5 million. Inflows last week were largely driven by the US, which recorded $2.65 billion, while Switzerland and Germany saw smaller inflows of $23 million and $19.8 million. Australia added $8.7 million. In contrast, Sweden saw outflows of $15.9 million, while Canada, Brazil, and Hong Kong recorded outflows of $13.6 million, $2.4 million, and $2.3 million, respectively. Following price rallies, Hong Kong has continued to experience outflows, which reached $132 million for June. Bitcoin Defies June Lull Bitcoin defied its usual June weakness with a last-minute rally, as it caught up to equities after Trump’s $4.5 trillion tax bill advanced in the Senate. According to QCP Capital’s note , the focus has now shifted to today’s vote, aiming for a July 4 deadline. On the institutional side of things, demand remains strong, with spot BTC ETFs seeing $2.2 billion in inflows. Strategy and Metaplanet continued steady accumulation, while leveraged longs increased as the leading crypto approached $108K. Ethereum and Solana rallied on optimism over potential ETH and SOL staking ETFs. However, options markets remain muted, risk reversals also appear to be flat, and implied volatility is near historical lows despite the bullish spot price action.

2025-07-01T07:15:42,"Financial Advisor Edelman predicts that Bitcoin could hit $500,000 with TradFi involvement.","Ric Edelman, the founder of Edelman Financial Engines, has called on investors to allocate between 40% and 10% of their portfolio to crypto. The prominent financial advisor shared the take in a recent whitepaper for the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals ( DACFP). According to Edelman , who is also DACFP’s founder, the traditional investment model of 60/40 allocation to stock and bond is no longer useful. He attributed this to the massive technological advancements that have led to high longevity rates. Instead, he recommended that investors put their money in crypto while outlining the percentage to allocate based on their risk profiles. In Edelman’s opinion, aggressive investors should have 40% of their crypto investments, while conservative ones should have 10%. He said: “Conservative investors should now have a 10% crypto allocation. Moderate clients should place 25% of their portfolios in crypto, and aggressive clients should allocate 40% of their investments to crypto.” Interestingly, the veteran investor with 39 years of experience in the financial sector noted that investing in crypto is no longer a speculative trade. According to him, a passive market-weighted index of all asset classes would have 3% allocated to crypto, showing just how big the sector has become. Thus, anyone choosing to ignore the crypto sector is simply shorting it. Edelman bullish on crypto, says Bitcoin could reach $500,000 Meanwhile, Edelman made a bullish case for investors to allocate up to 40% of their portfolio to crypto. According to him, there is no reason anyone would choose to ignore an asset class that has outperformed the rest of the market for 15 consecutive years. In backing up his claim, he highlighted high-performing crypto assets and sectors, including the stablecoin sector. He noted that Tether’s massive $13 billion profits last year exceeded what several major US companies, including McDonald’s, BlackRock, IBM, and Ford, pulled in. Edelman’s summary of why everyone should invest in crypto (Source: DACFP) Beyond that, Edelman believes President Donald Trump’s win in 2024 has also set the stage for crypto’s good fortunes. According to him, the pro-crypto moves from the Trump administration and policy reversal from individuals and institutions are all signs that crypto is now a derisked investment. Unsurprisingly, the prominent financial advisor is particularly bullish on Bitcoin and has predicted it could be worth $500,000, noting that this is based on demand and supply. He noted that institutions’ massive accumulation of assets will continue to drive up their prices. He said: “There’s $750 trillion in global assets (stocks, bonds, real estate, gold, cash and collectibles). A mere 1% allocation would cause $7.5 trillion to flow into Bitcoin. That’s $377,000 per bitcoin. Add that to Bitcoin’s current price, and you get to about $500,000 per Bitcoin. It’s simple arithmetic.” Interestingly, Edelman highlighted how investors can get crypto exposure, from direct acquisition to equity proxies. His whitepaper also advises financial advisors to allocate part of their portfolio to crypto by including responses to clients’ common objections and criticizing advisors who do not recommend crypto to their customers. Reactions trail Edelman’s endorsement of crypto allocation Meanwhile, the whitepaper from Edelman has sparked a mixed but mostly positive reaction from experts. Bloomberg senior analyst Eric Balchunas described it as the biggest endorsement of crypto from TradFi since BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. According to him, this is because of Edelman’s status in the financial advisory community, where he is one of the most influential voices. He said: “This guy is Mr RIA. Manages $300b for 1.3 million clients. Tops the Barron’s list of America Advisors regularly.” Meanwhile, some in the crypto community believe that Edelman should have specified BTC as the asset to invest in rather than simply saying crypto. Balchunas noted that this should not be a cause for debate, as almost all investors, including Edelman, acknowledge that Bitcoin is the primary investment asset in the crypto sector. Interestingly, Bitwise European head of research André Dragosh does not agree that technological advancements killed the 60/40 model. Instead, he attributes it to rising inflation, noting that stocks and bonds underperform once inflation rises above 5%. However, he also recommended diversifying into hard assets such as Gold and Bitcoin.

Institutions Driving Markets Edelman’s recommendation comes as institutional adoption accelerates, with over $20 billion invested in spot Bitcoin ETFs by wealthy investors and institutions, and more than 70 crypto ETF proposals pending with the SEC. The finance guru also cited the Trump administration’s regulatory reversal, the growth of stablecoins, and basic supply-demand dynamics supporting his bullish outlook, even suggesting Bitcoin could reach $500,000. Institutional investors and corporations have been scooping up all of the Bitcoin that long-term holders have been selling, which is why prices have stagnated recently. However, “Bitcoin’s price appreciation isn’t speculation — it’s just supply and demand,” concluded Edelman.

Recall that FTX commenced the distribution of funds to eligible users on February 18, 2025, starting with small creditors with claims under $50,000. According to Kavuri, FTX paid creditors in this category (those entitled to claims under $50,000) 120% of their initial claim value. This indicates that creditors received a 20% premium on their original claim value. Afterward, FTX commenced the second round of repayments on May 30, 2025, distributing $5 billion to creditors with claims over $50,000. The exchange distributed the funds within three business days of May 30. However, creditors with claims exceeding $50,000 received only 72.5% of their initial claim value. Next Payment Schedule Notably, Kavuri has disclosed the next repayment date for the remaining 27.5% of claims to large creditors. According to him, the upcoming distribution is expected to take place in Q4 2025, specifically from October to December. Additionally, he suggested that the repayment schedule could be extended to 2026 or 2027. This repayment will ensure that creditors with claims exceeding $50,000 receive 100% of their claim. Besides the claim value, these large creditors are also entitled to post-petition interest, which totals 40% to 80%. https://twitter.com/sunil_trades/status/1939692898154369096FTX's Epic Collapse and Repayment EffortsThis ongoing repayment schedule comes more than two years after FTX's collapse in November 2022. The exchange declared bankruptcy, with key executives sentenced to several years in prison. Specifically, a federal court in New York sentenced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) to 25 years in prison due to his role in mismanaging users' funds, leading to the exchange’s downfall. The court subsequently sentenced other executives, including Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison and FTX Digital Markets CEO Ryan Salame, to two and seven-and-a-half-year jail terms, respectively. Since the epic failure of FTX, the exchange has been working to reimburse users, with repayments commencing earlier this year. Despite FTX’s efforts, many have criticized the disbursement process for valuing users’ claims at token prices as of the time of the bankruptcy filing in late 2022. It is worth noting that crypto prices have soared significantly ever since. For instance, Bitcoin, which traded around $20,000 in late 2022, has rallied more than 400% to over $100,000.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/07/01/ftx-reveals-next-repayment-date-to-fully-compensate-large-creditors/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ftx-reveals-next-repayment-date-to-fully-compensate-large-creditors,"EXCHANGE|MARKET|BTC|BUSINESS|RESEARCH","Market|Latest Crypto Exchanges News|Latest FTX News Market Updates",cryptocompare

The group will enable private clients to trade cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), directly through their mobile banking apps via the group's securities platform, DekaBank, with the facility expected to go live by summer 2026. The news comes months after DekaBank introduced crypto trading and custody services for institutional clients and represents the growing acceptance of digital assets within traditional banking systems. The German Savings Bank Association (DSGV) reportedly backed the decision to enable crypto trading, citing growing demand and the prevalence of legal framework under the so-called European MiCAR Regulation. Earlier this year, Matthias Diessl, president of the Savings Banks in Bavaria, said in a Bloomberg interview that savings banks should offer customers the opportunity to trade cryptocurrencies, deviating from a three-year-old committee recommendation cautioning against enabling crypto trading. That said, despite warming up to the idea, DGSV still considers digital assets as highly speculative investments, according to Bloomberg.

2025-07-01T07:04:10,"Lawsuit Alleges Citibank Ignored Red Flags, Aided Scammers in $20,000,000 Pig Butchering Romance Scam","A Texas man is suing the financial giant Citibank for allegedly enabling scammers in a $20 million pig butchering scheme. Pig butchering scams typically involve scammers gaining the trust of victims over time to convince them to invest digital assets or cash into fraudulent websites that they control. Michael B. Zidell says in newly filed court documents that he was contacted on Facebook in early 2023 by someone claiming to be a California business owner named Carolyn Parker. Zidell says he perceived a romantic relationship developing with Parker, who told him that she had invested in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on a website called “OpenrarityPro.com” and made millions of dollars in investment gains. Zidell sent 43 wire transfers totalling $20 million to different accounts to “make a market” for NFTs on OpenarirtyPro.com as Parker had instructed. Of those, 12 transfers worth nearly $4 million were sent to one Citibank account called Guju, Inc. A month or so after Zidell started investing, OpenrarityPro.com displayed his account as being worth more than $300 million, but when he tried to withdraw some of the funds, he was told he’d have to send more money to cover a “risk deposit,” according to the court documents. In late April, the OpenrarityPro.com website disappeared, and Zidell began to suspect he was the victim of fraud. Zidell’s lawyers argue in the court documents that Citibank didn’t exercise thorough due diligence on the Guju account. “In the account opening documents for Defendant Citibank’s accounts for Guju, Inc., their customer states that it will receive no wire transfers, and the total value of the wires it would out would be less than $250,000 per month. In fact, the wires they say they will send are $8,000 transfers to China. The reality was obviously different. The account received no less than twelve (12) wires from Plaintiffs and dozens from others. Some of the outbound wires exceeded $2,000,000.00. Even worse, the account stated an annual gross revenue of $300,000 and Guju received more than 12 times that amount from Plaintiffs alone in two weeks. The first wire from Plaintiffs exceeded Guju’s stated annual revenue by almost 50%.” Zidell’s lawyers also argue Citibank operated recklessly and provided “substantial assistance” to Parker and her co-conspirators by opening bank accounts and providing services. “Defendant is liable as an aider and abettor as it, directly or indirectly, knew of the tortious conduct of the NFT Enterprise because the transactions at issue expressly contradicted the account opening documents and violated… ‘red flags.’ Defendant materially aided the seller or issuer of a security and are, therefore, jointly and severally liable with the seller or issuer and to the same extent as the seller or issuer.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-01T07:00:18,"Solana Summer Loading? SOL Eyes $180 Following Staked ETF-Fueled Breakout","Solana (SOL) has retested a crucial resistance level after recovering the $150 level over the weekend. The surge, fueled by the upcoming launch of a SOL-based staked exchange-traded fund (ETF), has led some analysts to forecast a rally toward the next key target. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price At $145,000 In September? Bullish Dojis Suggest Upward Move Solana Staked ETFs Coming On Wednesday On Monday, Solana’s price soared to a key resistance level following the introduction of “the first-ever Solana staked crypto ETF in the US.” Rex Shares announced it will launch a Solana-based staked ETF this Wednesday, aiming to offer exposure to SOL and staking rewards. According to the X post, the REX-Osprey ETF will track SOL’s performance while “generating yield through on-chain staking,” starting a “new era of yield-generating crypto exposure.” As a result, Solana climbed to the $160 barrier, which led to nearly $9 million in short positions liquidated on Monday afternoon. Market Watcher Daan Crypto Trades considers Solana “bounced nicely over the weekend” but has yet to turn the Low Timeframe (LTF) trend around. He explained that reclaiming the $159-$167 area is necessary to aim for higher levels. Additionally, the Daily 200-day Moving Average (MA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) are currently located within this range. “I would want to see price trade back above that to start targeting the $180-$200 region again,” he detailed. Nonetheless, the trader questioned whether a Solana spot ETF-driven rally will fuel the cryptocurrency’s run. Notably, multiple investment firms, including Grayscale, VanEck, 21Shares, and Bitwise, have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a spot SOL ETF in the US. According to recent reports, the investment products have a “high likelihood” of being approved in the coming weeks, which has seemingly fueled investors’ expectations of a bullish “Solana Summer.” “The big question is how much demand there will be,” Daan asserted, noting that Ethereum (ETH) sport ETFs, approved in July 2024, had a disappointing launch and “only started seeing decent inflows about a year later.” SOL Ready For Another Breakout? Following the ETF-fueled breakout, analyst Hardy noted Solana’s “Textbook move, clean breakout, clean retest, and pump,” which could trigger a run toward the $200 barrier. Notably, the cryptocurrency saw a remarkable performance over the weekend, reclaiming the $144-$148 crucial area and breaking past the $150 mark. Amid this performance, the analyst highlighted that Solana had broken out of its local downtrend line after reclaiming the $148 resistance and was retesting the breakout zone. He explained that there is “Juicy liquidity sitting above, ready to be taken,” adding that Solana needed to hold the $150 support to continue its bullish run toward the next target. Related Reading: Analyst Reveals Rational Behind XRP Price Reaching $9.5 And $37.5 Meanwhile, analyst Crypto Batman considers that Solana is “setting up very nicely” after the $160 retest. Per the post, “It has broken out from a bullish flag pattern that bottomed at the 0.618 Fibonacci level, a clear sign of impulsive strength in the trend.” It’s worth noting that SOL has been trading within the bullish formation since the May breakout, hovering between the $130 and $180 range for nearly two months. The analyst forecasted that a quick retest to close the bullish Fair Value Gap (FVG) and the pattern’s upper boundary, around the $148 area, “could set the stage for the next leg.” As of this writing, Solana is trading at $155, a 2% increase in the daily timeframe.

The Fineqia Bitcoin Yield ETP (YBTC), listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange, targets a 6% annual yield by deploying investor capital into DeFi strategies. It is issued by Fineqia’s Liechtenstein-based subsidiary and advised by Psalion Yield, a digital asset investment firm focused on blockchain-based yield. Unlike existing crypto yield ETPs that rely on derivatives or structured notes, YBTC maintains one-to-one exposure to bitcoin while generating returns directly from DeFi protocols. “It allows investors to earn more BTC while they hold it, combining long-term conviction with compounding returns, all inside a regulated wrapper,” said Fineqia CEO, Bundeep Singh Rangar. The ETP also supports in-kind transfers, meaning that digital asset holders can contribute BTC directly to the product without the need to first convert into cash incurring a taxable event. YBTC arrives at a time when investor interest in crypto-focused investments is growing. These investment products has brought digital assets closer to traditional investors, allowing them to invest in digital assets in a familiar way through brokerage accounts without the need of crypto wallets and blockchain transactions. Bitcoin exchange-traded products enjoyed rapid growth over the past year and have gobbled up $150 billion of assets, Fineqia said.

2025-07-01T06:42:07,"Senator Lummis pushes for crypto-friendly amendments in Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill","U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis wants to add a crypto tax amendment to President Donald Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill to exclude small transactions from capital gains and resolve double taxation for miners and stakers. On June 30, Lummis announced her push to insert language into the sweeping budget reconciliation bill that would overhaul how digital asset activity is taxed. “It’s time to stop this unfair tax treatment and ensure America is the world’s Bitcoin and Crypto Superpower,” Lummis wrote on X. Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill , a more than 1,000-page reconciliation package central to President Trump’s economic agenda, includes sweeping fiscal and regulatory measures and has become a high-stakes priority for Republican lawmakers ahead of a self-imposed Friday deadline. The proposed amendment includes a de minimis exemption for crypto transactions under $300 and changes to how staking and mining rewards are taxed, aligning them with the point of sale rather than the time of receipt. In documents shared with crypto media, Lummis’ office outlined key elements of the proposal, including a $300 threshold on individual transactions and a $5,000 annual cap on total tax-free activity. It also aims to eliminate what industry advocates describe as “double taxation,” where digital asset holders are taxed both when they receive staking or mining rewards and again when they sell those assets. You might also like: Trump-linked American Bitcoin raises $220M to purchase Bitcoin and mining rigs Further, the amendment includes language addressing tax treatment for crypto lending, wash sales, and charitable contributions. The goal, according to Lummis and industry backers, is to remove outdated tax barriers that have discouraged everyday use and long-term holding of digital assets. Crypto advocacy groups, including the Bitcoin Policy Institute and the Solana Policy Institute, along with prominent industry figures such as Michael Saylor, have publicly endorsed the amendment. (See below.) We must end unfair taxes on BTC miners if America is going to be the world's Bitcoin Superpower. https://t.co/3DeRFx558v — Michael Saylor (@saylor) June 30, 2025 Matthew Pines, executive director at the Bitcoin Policy Institute, urged constituents to contact Senate Finance Committee Republicans to support the measure. He noted that a de minimis exemption would “reduce [the] burden, promoting fair compliance and everyday adoption.” Similarly, Kristin Smith, president of the Solana Policy Institute, said the amendment could “unlock domestic growth and create jobs” by clarifying staking tax policy. For crypto advocates at The Digital Chamber, the proposal is a “long overdue fix” to what the group described as a misalignment between tax policy and economic reality. “Today, staking and block rewards are taxed upon both acquisition and point of sale. Senator Lummis’ provision solves this by taxing rewards only when sold,” the group wrote in a call-to-action message Still, it remains uncertain whether the crypto-focused amendment will be adopted. The Senate is set to vote on numerous proposed changes to the reconciliation bill throughout the week. Trump has reportedly pressed lawmakers to pass the final version by July 5. Even if adopted in the Senate, the bill would still require approval in the House before reaching the president’s desk. Last year, lawmakers Wiley Nickel and Drew Ferguson introduced a similar measure targeting the taxation framework for cryptocurrency staking rewards, but it failed to advance through the House Ways and Means Committee.

2025-07-01T06:40:10,"Arkham: Satoshi Nakamoto address receives $20k from mystery wallet","Arkham’s on-chain monitoring detected a suspected transfer of $20,000 in BTC to Satoshi Nakamoto’s address. This is the latest transfer made to Satoshi in the past four months. According to on-chain data from Arkham Intelligence, an unknown address sent 0.185 BTC (or around $20,000 at the time of transfer) to an address believed to be owned by the Bitcoin ( BTC ) founder. The transfer was conducted late on June 30. At press time, the wallet linked to Satoshi has $117 billion in holdings, all of which are stored in Bitcoin. Arkham’s official X account suspected that the transfer could have been either an accident or a withdrawal made from an exchange or other crypto-related service. However, it stated it could also be a generous show of gratitude from “an OG Bitcoiner giving back.” It is worth noting that this is the second largest transfer made to the Satoshi Nakamoto address since a Binance user’s account made a $200,000 Bitcoin transfer to the address back in February 2025. Though, it remains unclear whether the transfer was an accident on the exchange’s part or a spontaneous act of gratitude from early Bitcoin users. Satoshi Nakamoto’s address received $20,000 in BTC from an unidentified wallet, July 1, 2025 | Source: Arkham You might also like: CZ speculates Satoshi Nakamoto is an AI from the future At press time, BTC has been seeing moderate drops in the cycle. In the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has gone down 1.26% and is currently trading hands at $106,931. BTC’s market cap continues to stand at $2.12 trillion with a daily trading volume of $22.3 billion. Why is Satoshi Nakamoto’s wallet receiving donations? According to previous data from a CryptoQuant report revealed that miners from the “Satoshi Nakamoto era” only managed to sell 150 BTC in 2025, a significant decrease compared to the staggering 10,000 BTC sold during the same period last year. Not only that, the daily outflow of miners has also fallen from an initial 23,000 BTC in February to only around 6,000 BTC, with the amount of BTC directly transferred to exchanges remaining low. Therefore, it is possible that the transfer was made by a Bitcoin enthusiast to support the Satoshi era miners. At the start of this year, another unidentified wallet was also caught sending $1.19m in Bitcoin to Satoshi Nakamoto’s Genesis address. Similar to the transfer made in February, the sender also used an account on the Binance exchange to send Bitcoin to the first wallet ever made on the network.

According to Kiyosaki, if BTC fails to reach $1 million, he might receive the branding of a sucker.However, he insists he would rather suck than become a loser when he misses Bitcoin’s impending rally to $1 million. This, he believes, is well within Bitcoin’s capabilities. As a result, he projected that the crypto leader would trade at the price mark one day.Meanwhile, from Bitcoin’s current price of $106,784, a rally to $1 million would culminate in a staggering 836% growth. Remarkably, Kiyosaki had earlier predicted that Bitcoin would reach this level by 2030.Nonetheless, he advised due diligence, urging investors to think for themselves rather than make financial decisions based on his “ramblings.” Notwithstanding, his experience and guts tell him Bitcoin could set people on a journey of financial freedom.$1M per BTC a CommonplacePredictions of a Bitcoin surge to $1 million have become a common expectation among enthusiasts.

2025-07-01T06:05:08,"Renowned Economist Robert Kiyosaki Says, “Bitcoin Seems Very Expensive Right Now, But I’m Still Buying It,” and Explains Why","Robert Kiyosaki, one of the well-known names in the financial world, shared his thoughts about Bitcoin on his personal social media account. Kiyosaki stated that Bitcoin's current price level seems “expensive” but that in the future, even today's prices will be considered “cheap”. Kiyosaki admitted that he started investing in Bitcoin late, and stated that he made his first BTC purchase at $6,000. The economist, who said that this price was expensive for him at the time, said that he regrets not buying more Bitcoin at that level today: “I bought my first Bitcoin for $6,000. It was expensive at the time. But now I wish I had bought more.” Related News: Tensions Escalate Between Donald Trump and Fed Chair Jerome Powell - Trump Sends Handwritten Letter - Here Are the Details Reminding that Bitcoin is trading at $107,000 today, Kiyosaki stated that he continues to buy despite this: “Today, my brain says again, ‘this is expensive.’ But I’m buying more. Because if and when Bitcoin reaches $1 million, I’ll say again, ‘I wish I had bought more.’” Giving a message to investors, Kiyosaki argued that those who can only buy one Satoshi (one 100 millionth of Bitcoin) will be happy with their decisions in the future: “Even if you can only afford one Satoshi today, I believe that five years from now you will say, ‘I wish I had bought more.’” Kiyosaki said he didn't know if Bitcoin would ever reach $1 million, but added: “All I know is this: When I look back at the Bitcoin I bought at $107,000, I'll say, 'Buying Bitcoin at that price was priceless.'” *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-01T05:53:04,"Pundit Says Most Money He’ll Ever Make Will Come from Holding XRP to $100+","Crypto founder Edoardo Farina has issued an ambitious outlook regarding his XRP investment, stating that $100 or more in XRP would yield him the most money ever. In a recent post on X, Farina stated that the greatest financial gain he expects to achieve will come from holding XRP until its value surpasses $100.The statement generated attention among XRP holders and critics, given the extreme nature of the outlook. With XRP currently trading around $2, a surge to $100 would represent an increase of over 4,900%.Making Money with XRP at $100+Pundits like Farina often cite this price point as a potential threshold for financial freedom. It forms the basis of his repeated calls for investors to hold at least 10,000 XRP tokens . This amount would place investors in the millionaire class if XRP reaches $100 per coin.Several factors influence this outlook. Some are bullish due to XRP's fundamentals, while others draw confidence from XRP's historical performance.For example, crypto wealth mentor Linda Jones reflected on her early investment, noting that $100 bought 400 XRP at $0.25 each back in January 2021. Today, with XRP trading at $2.18, that same $100 would buy fewer than 50 tokens, highlighting the asset’s significant price growth.Jones believes this trend will continue. Specifically, she predicted that in the future, $100 might buy just one XRP token, implying a price above $100. However, the journey to $100 and the required market cap of approximately $6 trillion leads many to call such ambitions unrealistic. Meanwhile, proponents are drawing inspiration from Bitcoin’s trajectory to support their bullish XRP outlook. Altan Tutar, founder of MoreMarkets, recently sided with XRP enthusiasts on their bold forecasts.Tutar noted that if Bitcoin can reach $100K, then XRP has grounds for similar price performance. While he didn’t explicitly endorse the $10,000 figure, he acknowledged that the XRP community’s belief mirrors the early optimism once held for Bitcoin.More Money from Shorting Bitcoin to $5,000?Meanwhile, proponents like Farina are bullish on XRP at the expense of Bitcoin. He added that his second-largest financial gain will come from shorting Bitcoin below $5,000.He is suggesting that Bitcoin could plummet from its current level of $107,000 to under $5,000. At the same time, he expects XRP to soar to $100.This extreme bearish take on Bitcoin contrasts with the widespread institutional adoption via spot ETFs and increasing demand from sovereign wealth funds.Moreover, XRP is unlikely to soar by 4,900% while Bitcoin drops by 90%, based on historical trends. Bitcoin's ascent has historically benefited altcoins like XRP. A significant dip in BTC would likely drag down the broader crypto market, as has been seen in past cycles.Ultimately, Farina’s perspective suggests a capital rotation from Bitcoin into XRP, fueling XRP’s rise while Bitcoin crashes. However, this remains a highly speculative scenario, especially given Bitcoin's adoption and entrenched market dominance compared to XRP.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/07/01/pundit-says-most-money-hell-ever-make-will-come-from-holding-xrp-to-100/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pundit-says-most-money-hell-ever-make-will-come-from-holding-xrp-to-100,"XRP|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS","Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction",cryptocompare
