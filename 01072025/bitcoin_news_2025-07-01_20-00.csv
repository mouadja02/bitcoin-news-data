2025-07-01T17:55:26,"UniCredit Offers Bitcoin Exposure to Italian Elites via BlackRock’s IBIT","UniCredit Offers Italian Elites Exposure to Bitcoin via BlackRock’s IBIT Italy’s second-largest bank, UniCredit SpA, is embracing Bitcoin courtesy of traditional finance. Since July 1, it is offering a five-year, dollar-denominated structured note referenced to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), specifically tailored for sophisticated investors. The product, available for sale until July 28, is fully capital-protected at maturity—providing risk-conscious investors with access to the upside potential of Bitcoin without the volatility generally linked to crypto markets. A Gateway to Bitcoin with Low Volatility In contrast to conventional crypto holdings, UniCredit’s certificate is crafted for institutional investors apprehensive of price volatility and regulatory uncertainty. Supported by IBIT, which manages more than $73 billion in assets, the product offers a liquid, regulated access to Bitcoin markets—without wallet or token ownership. According to Bloomberg in a report based on an internal memo, the offering is a “low-friction” gateway for digital assets—ideal for Italian wealth managers needing compliant, traditional-type products. Why This Matters for Europe’s Financial Sector UniCredit’s move represents an evolving institutional shift. As BlackRock’s IBIT listed on Euronext Paris and Xetra in March, interest in Bitcoin has surged among European institutions. But many are still holding back due to regulatory and custody concerns. By wrapping Bitcoin exposure in a familiar TradFi product that shields capital, UniCredit may set the standard for how Europe’s banks come to digital assets. This hybrid approach—crypto profit, no direct crypto touch—is likely to be emulated soon by banks across the continent that remain on the sidelines.",btcpulse,https://btc-pulse.com/unicredit-offers-bitcoin-exposure-to-italian-elites/,"BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|FIAT|MARKET","Bitcoin|Sticky|Regulation",cryptocompare

U.S. stocks were mixed after President Trump’s budget bill passed the U.S. Senate. On Tuesday, June 1, Dow Jones was up 340 points or 0.77%. At the same time, the S&P 500 retreated from its record highs, losing 0.11%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.61% Traders were mostly focused on the progress with trade talks and Donald Trump’s massive budget bill, which passed the Senate . Senate members voted 51-50 on the bill, with Vice President JD Vance breaking the tie, setting the stage for the House vote. The bill will provide trillions in tax cuts while lowering spending on Medicaid, food stamps, and clean energy. What is more, the bill would add an estimated $3.3 trillion to the nation’s deficit, which caused Republican Senators to vote against it. Fiscal conservatives Rand Paul, Susan Collins, and Thom Tillis were the three dissenters. You might also like: Why Trump’s ‘big, beautiful’ bill is bullish for Bitcoin and altcoins Musk reignites feud with Trump At the same time, the bill’s cuts to clean energy and tax breaks to the fossil fuel industry brought the ire of tech billionaire Elon Musk. Musk, a former Trump ally, reignited his feud with the President, calling the bill “utterly insane and destructive.” Notably, Musk was a major beneficiary of the U.S. subsidies to clean energy, especially to electric vehicles like those produced by his company, Tesla. In response to the criticism, Trump threatened to look into Musk’s lucrative contracts with the U.S. government, including those related to SpaceX, another of his firms. At this point, traders seem to believe that Trump has all the cards, and some traders are concerned that the President can do significant damage to Tesla’s business. On market open, shares of Tesla fell almost 8%, from $320 to $295, subsequently recovering to $303.

2025-07-01T17:35:00,"Solana rejected at $178 resistance — can $105 support hold the Double Bottom?","Solana is testing a major resistance zone near $178, which has triggered multiple rejections. If price fails to break through, the path opens toward $105.89 — a level that may form a bullish double bottom if defended. Market structure and volume behavior suggest further downside is likely unless bulls reclaim control quickly. Solana ( SOL ) is currently trading below the $178 resistance, a level that aligns with both the value area high and a key high time frame supply zone. Since establishing the local swing high, price action has formed lower highs and lower lows — a bearish pattern signaling weakness. If this rejection holds, the next major area of interest sits around $105.89, where a structural double bottom could develop and signal a potential trend reversal. Key technical points, $178 Resistance Rejection: Price faces high time frame resistance in confluence with the value area high Double Bottom Setup: Key support at $105.89 may provide reversal if tested and held Auction Rotation in Play: Backtest of value area high increases probability of rotation to value area low SOL/USDT (1D) Chart, Source: TradingView The rejection from $178 continues to weigh on Solana’s price structure. Despite several pushes higher, buyers have failed to gain control above this resistance zone. The confluence of the value area high and high time frame resistance makes this region particularly significant, and failure to break above it has confirmed short-term bearish structure. You might also like: Base protocol Limitless raises $4M, backed by Coinbase Ventures and Arthur Hayes Price has now started to rotate lower, and from an auction theory perspective, the loss and backtest of the value area high suggests that the market may seek balance by moving toward the value area low. This would bring price into the $105.89 zone — a high time frame support level that also represents a key structural low. A sweep of this area, followed by strong buyer response, could establish a double bottom pattern, often a reliable reversal signal. Another concern for bulls is the local trend, which continues to form lower highs and lower lows beneath resistance. If price fails to reclaim lost levels soon, it increases the probability of continuation to the downside. Still, a test of $105.89 isn’t inherently bearish — it may instead offer a key pivot point for Solana to reset and build strength for another move higher. What to expect in the coming price action As long as Solana trades below $178, the probability of further downside remains elevated. A move toward $105.89 is likely, and if this level holds, it could form a double bottom and launch a rotation back toward resistance. Failure to defend this support, however, would confirm a breakdown and risk shifting the larger trend bearish. Watch for volume signals near the lows to confirm buyer interest.

2025-07-01T17:30:58,"Bitcoin naysayers say Strategy is taking part in ‘financial gibberish’","Michael Saylor’s crypto-centric company, Strategy, is projected to report an unrealized gain of approximately $14 billion for the second quarter of 2025, credit given almost entirely to a 30% surge in Bitcoin prices. Much different from corporations like Amazon and JPMorgan Chase, which generate billions through traditional operations, Strategy’s anticipated earnings result primarily from digital asset exposure. According to a Tuesday report from Bloomberg, the company could bring in just $112.8 million in revenue from its legacy software business during Q2 2025. Bitcoin price rally fuels earnings surge The projected profit for the quarter ending June 30 is largely attributed to Bitcoin’s rise, which saw prices increase from about $82,444 at the end of March to more than $106,000 by late June. At the beginning of the quarter, Strategy held 528,185 BTC, translating to over $43.5 billion in value. When Bitcoin appreciated, the market value of those holdings rose by more than $13 billion. A series of smaller weekly Bitcoin purchases during the quarter added an additional $600 million to unrealized gains, Bloomberg calculations show. On June 30, the company disclosed a major purchase of 4,980 BTC for approximately $531.9 million, at an average price of $106,801 per Bitcoin. These purchases were funded through proceeds from the sale of MSTR Class A shares and preferred equity vehicles STRK and STRF. The latest purchase brings Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 597,325 BTC, acquired for $4.40 billion at an average price of $70,982. At current market rates, the company’s unrealized gains total nearly $21.8 billion, with the portfolio now valued at $64.3 billion. Strategy software and crypto business flourish Over the last five years, Michael Saylor has moved Strategy from a business intelligence software firm towards a highly leveraged proxy for Bitcoin investments. His BTC accumulation methodology includes stock and debt issuance, convertible notes, and, most recently, preferred share sales. According to Bloomberg analysts, the first quarter of 2025 was a turning point for the company when it implemented a new accounting rule requiring Bitcoin to be valued at market prices. Under the previous system, Bitcoin was treated as an intangible asset, forcing companies to record impairment losses when prices fell, while unrealized gains were not recognized unless the asset was sold. The change allowed Strategy to record Bitcoin’s quarterly volatility in its earnings. It had counted a $4.2 billion loss in Q1 when Bitcoin declined by 12%, but the current quarter is expected to reverse that with an exponential profit. Bitcoin naysayers say Strategy is taking part in ‘financial gibberish’ According to short-seller Jim Chanos, investors should short Strategy stock for buying Bitcoin directly, arguing that the premium on the company’s shares compared to its crypto holdings is unjustified. Speaking in an interview late June, he said Saylor’s valuation model is “nothing more than financial gibberish.” Since Saylor initiated the Bitcoin strategy in mid-2020, when the firm was still called MicroStrategy, its share price has surged more than 3,300%. Over the same period, Bitcoin has gained roughly 1,000%, and the S&P 500 has seen an uptick of around 115%. In the second quarter alone, Strategy’s shares rose 40%, compared to an 11% gain in the broader S&P index. Following the Q1 loss, multiple class-action lawsuits have been filed against Strategy, alleging that executives misled shareholders. In a recent SEC filing, the company said it plans to “vigorously defend against these claims.” Saylor’s playbook has inspired several companies, including Sharplink Gaming Inc. and BitMine Immersion Technologies, which have both begun accumulating other cryptos like Ether and Solana, seeking to replicate Strategy’s crypto-treasury model.

His former partner, a mother of his six-year-old child, reported to the FBI that she saw suspicious screenshots on his device, which included evidence of crypto transactions and conversations in other languages. According to a court filing by FBI special agent Samuel Morgan, Rathod allegedly received $1.2 million worth of BTC through a network of seven bank accounts at six different financial institutions. His former partner noticed the scheme after Rathod repeatedly complained about his bank accounts being closed. Man charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud Tushal Rahod has been charged with multiple counts, including conspiracy to commit wire fraud, money laundering, and conspiracy to commit money laundering, by the FBI. The alleged crimes took place between November 2021 and June 2024. In his court filing, Samuel Morgan revealed that as part of the investigations, the FBI had obtained records from Google for tushal27@gmail.com, Apple iCloud accounts belonging to the same email, and kluvbb110011@gmail.com, all via court order. FBI special agent Morgan alleged that Rathod incorporated two companies he used in the scheme. In 2016, Rathod registered T3 Telecom, LLC, a telecommunications company that tested and deployed network devices. He also incorporated TSV Telecom Constructions LLC in 2021. Morgan added that between April 2022 and June 2024, the accused received over $1.7 million in suspected fraudulent proceeds from business email compromise (BEC) fraud and counterfeit checks. The accused received the funds through six different financial institutions, with five accounts belonging to T3 Telecommunications and one for TSV Telecommunications. BEC fraud originates from compromised employee login credentials through spear phishing. Scammers intercept information about the company’s upcoming payments and deceive vendors into completing payments through fake domains. Rathod used at least $1.2 million of the proceeds to purchase Bitcoin and sent them to different external addresses. Three financial institutions contacted him in 2022, including Wells Fargo, notifying him that the money received into his account was unauthorized and would proceed to close the account. Later that year, M&T Bank also contacted Rathod and informed him of the fraudulent funds, but he replied with a fake invoice to justify the funds as legitimate income. The accused stopped contacting M&T Bank after learning police records had been filed. Rathod faces a 20-year jail term if convicted Tushal Rathod, the accused, allegedly recruited other people to aid his plan, including his former girlfriend, the owner of the iCloud account associated with kluvbb110011@gmail.com, to create businesses and open business bank accounts. According to the court filing by Samuel Morgan, Rathod recruited his family members too between May and July 2024 to assist in the scheme, which resulted in an additional $1 million deposited into accounts controlled by his girlfriend and family members. Citibank has been able to recover $800,000 worth of fraudulent funds. Morgan explained that in his training and experience, he could identify fraudsters who conduct BEC scams, often working with an extensive network of launderers to help them. He added that the scammers work with others to use multiple bank accounts to move money in a series of convoluted transactions that make it hard to identify the source or who controls the funds, referring to the plot as layering or funneling. Rhode Island real estate law firm was the first victim of the BEC scam reported in 2022, having lost approximately $163,298. The victim received an email that impersonated an employee at Northpointe Bank, directing the victim to send funds to an account supposedly belonging to a Mortgage Company, Carrington Mortgage, associated with a valid real estate transaction. California Credit Union was also involved in the scheme as the second victim, losing approximately $8 million to bank accounts controlled by other scammers.

The investment vehicle, linked to IBIT, adds credibility to a market still wrestling with regulatory caution. According to a Bloomberg report on July 1, UniCredit SpA will issue a five-year, dollar-denominated investment certificate tied to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), exclusively for professional clients in Italy. The offering, available from July 1 to 28, includes full capital protection at maturity, providing a critical feature for risk-averse institutions. Unlike speculative crypto products, this structured note is designed to give investors Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) upside without direct exposure to its notorious volatility. Citing an internal memo, Bloomberg noted that the structured product will serve as a low-friction access point to digital asset markets, without requiring direct crypto custody or wallet infrastructure. You might also like: Upbit and Naver Pay team up to launch Korean won stablecoin Why UniCredit’s Bitcoin bet could reshape European finance UniCredit’s move can be interpreted as a calculated response to shifting institutional demand. BlackRock’s IBIT, now holding over $73 billion in assets according to SoSoValue data, has proven that Bitcoin is no longer a fringe gamble but a mainstream allocation. By linking its certificate to IBIT, UniCredit is anchoring its offering to what is arguably the most established and liquid vehicle for bitcoin exposure in traditional finance today. The choice of a five-year term, full capital protection, and dollar denomination reflects the kind of design meant to reassure cautious allocators who’ve long viewed crypto as an off-limits asset class. For Italy’s wealth managers, that’s an elegant solution: all the upside, none of the regulatory or security risks. The bank’s decision also reflects a broader trend in European finance. Since BlackRock listed its Bitcoin ETP on Euronext Paris and Xetra in March, institutional interest has quietly surged. But many asset managers remain hesitant because they lack compliant pathways to invest. UniCredit’s product may solve that problem by wrapping Bitcoin exposure in a familiar, capital-protected format. If successful, it could become the blueprint for other risk-averse European banks still sitting on the sidelines.

Despite the uncertainty, he remains optimistic, noting that both Bitcoin and BTC dominance are showing strength that could benefit ETH in the near term, with $2,800 marked as the next major resistance. Mixed Signals Across Ethereum Key Timeframes In the post, CRYPTOWZRD pointed out a mixed close for Ethereum across key timeframes. While the monthly candle ended indecisively, signaling some short-term hesitation, the quarterly candle closed with strong bullish conviction. This, he suggests, sets the stage for more upward movement in the coming months as higher timeframes begin to assert dominance. Related Reading: Ethereum Gears Up For Breakout Above $2,800 – Bullish Momentum Builds He emphasized that today’s daily candles for both ETH and ETHBTC closed similarly indecisive, reflecting the current uncertainty in the market. However, with Bitcoin dominance starting to decline, he sees potential for ETHBTC to pick up strength, which could, in turn, fuel Ethereum’s next leg up. According to CRYPTOWZRD, ETHBTC is already showing signs of life, moving upward from a monthly double-bottom formation. He believes that clean, bullish candles forming from the 0.02270 BTC region would inject fresh momentum into Ethereum, helping to drive it toward the $2,800 resistance, a key level on the radar. He added that unless any negative fundamental developments occur, $2,400 remains Ethereum’s main daily support zone. As long as this holds, the broader structure remains intact, and the bullish thesis stays valid. Looking ahead, CRYPTOWZRD plans to keep his attention on the lower timeframes tomorrow. With volatility in play and setups brewing, he’ll be watching closely for quick scalp opportunities as Ethereum navigates through this critical range. Waiting On Chart Confirmation For The Next Intraday Move In his closing remarks, the analyst noted that Ethereum’s intraday chart experienced heightened volatility throughout the day. Despite the choppy price action, he sees clear setups forming that could present solid trading opportunities in the near term. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Eyes High Timeframe Close – Range Break Above $2,800 Could Be Violent A decisive breakout and close above the $2,550 resistance level would be a strong bullish signal, potentially opening the door for a long entry. On the flip side, if the price pulls back toward the $2,380 support and forms a bullish reversal pattern, that too could serve as a valid trigger for a long position. With these scenarios in mind, the analyst plans to closely monitor the intraday chart. His focus will be on spotting a clean and high-quality setup, one that aligns with price structure and momentum to time the next scalp trade effectively.

2025-07-01T16:55:45,"‘It Sounded Reasonable at the Time’ – Elderly JPMorgan Chase Customer Duped out of $13,000 by Contest Scam: Report","An elderly JPMorgan Chase customer is out thousands of dollars after scammers convinced him he won a big prize. An 87-year-old man from Portland, Oregon, lost a total of $13,000 to scammers who told him he needed to pay them money to receive hundreds of thousands of dollars and a new SUV, reports the NBC-affiliated KGW8. The victim, whose name was not provided, says he received a call one morning from a man claiming he won a Publishers Clearing House prize. “[He said] that I won second prize. Second prize is $850,000 and $150,000 in cash. And additionally, I was going to [get] a Mercedes SUV.” However, the victim says he was told he had to meet someone at his bank and hand over money to receive it. He says he followed the instructions and was met by a thief who walked with him into a Chase Bank branch in Northwest Portland. “I said, how much money do you need? He said $10,000. I said, what’s that for? He said, well, we need people to insure the car, give it license plates, install the plates. It sounded reasonable at the time.” The scam didn’t stop there. He says the thief got him to come back later that day and withdraw another $1,500, as well as go to CVS to buy three $500 gift cards. However, he says that when his wife, Iris, came home and he told her about the situation, she realized he had been scammed. She says the bank teller should have figured out her husband may have been a victim of fraud before letting him withdraw the funds. Says Iris, “When I got home he said, ‘I have good news for you. We won Publishers Clearing House. We’re going to get a big check.’ After that, I had a meltdown. None of this would have happened if the teller had called a manager. None of this would have happened, and it’s not like he looks like a young man. There was a man, like, shadowing him.” A Chase Bank spokesperson says the firm is looking into the matter. The Portland Police are also investigating. Says the victim, “I used to be a very bright guy, and I feel very stupid now having bought this.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-01T16:50:11,"Major European provider of crypto ATM services pauses operations in Germany","Leading Bitcoin ATM installer in Europe, Kurant, is pausing operations in Germany as it’s waiting for a new license under the EU’s latest regulations. While the company made it clear this is not a permanent measure, the move is taking most of the Federal Republic’s crypto teller machines out of service. Bitcoin is unavailable at ATMs across Germany Kurant, the Austrian firm that currently runs the highest number of cryptocurrency ATMs in Europe, is temporarily halting operations in Germany. Starting from July 1, Bitcoin will no longer be available for purchase at ATM locations across the country, the German crypto news outlet BTC Echo reported, quoting a press release on Monday. The company has a pending application for a license under the European Union’s new Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) law, and that has been cited as the main reason for its decision. Kurant’s ATMs will be out of service until the licensing process is completed, the announcement revealed. No information was provided as to how long this is going to take. While informing users it’s taking “a short break,” the operator noted it needs it to prepare for the new MiCA requirements, which “involve major technical and legal changes.” In a statement, its Managing Director, Stefan Grill, described the introduction of the set of EU rules as “an important step towards regulating the crypto market,” which he welcomed. He also assured: “We have already initiated the necessary measures to fully comply with the new standards.” Grill added that the temporary pause of services was a “responsible and necessary” move to ensure a smooth and safe transition. “We are taking this step early to be best prepared for the new regulatory framework – ensuring an even better user experience in the future,” Kurant explained on its website. Transactions initiated before July 1 will be completed as usual, and no new transactions will be possible until operations resume, the company highlighted, without providing a specific date for that, although it promised customers to post timely updates. Kurant to relaunch with new features Once it secures a MiCA license, Kurant intends to restart its machines with new features and offerings. “This includes a broader product range and improved services,” it stated. With over 300 devices, the company is Europe’s top operator of teller machines supporting cryptocurrencies. More than half of those are in Germany, which has a little over 150 Bitcoin ATMs in total, according to the tracking website Coin ATM Radar. Kurant made it clear that the pause is not affecting other EU nations where it maintains a presence: “As the European market leader, we will continue offering our services without interruption in Austria and Spain. Naturally, customers in those countries will also benefit from the upcoming new features.” The Austrian firm is a major player on the Old Continent, but the region as a whole is yet to catch up with North America in terms of crypto ATM numbers. With more than 30,000 locations, the United States is still the unchallenged global leader, accounting for over three-quarters of the world’s total, which now exceeds 38,000. Nevertheless, Bitcoin ATM installations in Europe have seen a steady growth over the past decade and are currently at their all-time high, with nearly 1,800 machines as of July 1, 2025. On average, a new cryptocurrency ATM is launched somewhere in the European Union almost every day, as Cryptopolitan recently reported . Unlike regular bank ATMs, the Bitcoin teller machines (also abbreviated as BTMs) offer users the opportunity to buy, and in some cases also sell, major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). They have been offering a simple way to get into crypto. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

2025-07-01T16:44:09,"In the Last Three Months, Companies Bought Way More Bitcoin Than ETFs – What Does This Mean? Experts Explain","Institutional interest in Bitcoin is shifting. Public companies are buying more Bitcoin than exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the third quarter in a row, continuing to embrace the strategy pioneered by MicroStrategy. According to Bitcoin Treasuries data, public companies purchased approximately 131,000 BTC in the second quarter of 2025, increasing their total assets by 18%, while ETFs purchased 111,000 BTC in the same period, with an 8% growth. According to Nick Marie, research director at Ecoinometrics, the motivation for companies to buy Bitcoin is quite different from ETF investors: “These companies accumulate BTC with the goal of increasing shareholder value. They are more focused on the amount of BTC in their vaults than the price level.” Marie noted that public companies increased their Bitcoin holdings by 4% in April, while this increase in ETFs remained at 2% during the same period. During this period, the market was volatile due to President Donald Trump’s first tariff announcements. Although ETFs are still the largest institutional Bitcoin investors with a total of 1.4 million BTC (6.8% of the maximum supply), the amount held by public companies has reached 855,000 BTC (4%). This trend also coincides with the regulatory easing seen in the cryptocurrency sector during the Trump administration. An executive order signed in March announced the creation of the official US Bitcoin reserve. The last time ETFs bought more BTC from public companies was in the third quarter of 2024, before Trump’s re-election. Some notable company moves in the second quarter also drew attention: GameStop adopted Bitcoin as a reserve asset with the approval of its board of directors and began purchasing it. Health technology company KindlyMD merged with Bitcoin investment company Nakamoto. Famous investor Anthony Pompliano’s company ProCap launched its own BTC purchasing program while entering the process of going public via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). Related News: BREAKING: Historic Change Claimed to Completely Clear the Way for Altcoin Spot ETFs on the SEC The pioneer of this trend and still the largest representative, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) is in the lead with 597,000 BTC. It is followed by Bitcoin mining company Mara Holdings with around 50,000 BTC. Ben Werkman, investment director at Swan Bitcoin, notes that Strategy’s scale will not be easy to catch up with: “They will continue to be an attractive destination for institutional capital due to their high liquidity.” By contrast, Werkman said smaller companies offer high-yield potential for individual investors and small-cap funds. These companies have the capacity to accumulate Bitcoin on a scale that individual investors cannot, thanks to their access to public capital markets. Nick Marie, on the other hand, thinks that this trend may not be long-lasting: “After 10 years, the number of companies that adhere to this strategy may have decreased. Because as the category expands, the impact of individual companies will be diluted. Also, BTC may have completely normalized by then.” Investor interest remains strong. These companies offer attractive leveraged investment vehicles for investors who already believe in Bitcoin, according to Werkman. “These companies offer not just Bitcoin, but Bitcoin-backed appreciation backed by operating income. That’s what makes them unique,” he says. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: In the Last Three Months, Companies Bought Way More Bitcoin Than ETFs – What Does This Mean?

With momentum stalling and an ABC corrective pattern potentially forming, a retracement appears likely. Following a strong rally, Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) has run into a technically significant resistance zone. The $41.55 level marks a prior horizontal resistance that now aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, forming what is commonly referred to as the Golden Pocket. Price action is showing signs of hesitation here, suggesting the impulsive leg may have completed and a corrective phase could be underway. Key technical points, $41.55 Resistance Zone: Golden Pocket Fibonacci confluence with previous high Corrective Structure Forming: Signs of an ABC retracement following completed Elliott Wave 5 $26.53 Support Region: High time frame support and next Fibonacci level below current price HYPE/USDT (1D) Chart | Source: TradingView From a technical perspective, the impulsive breakout in HYPER appears to have reached exhaustion after completing a five-wave Elliott structure. The current stall under $41.55— a level that has acted as both resistance and a Fibonacci retracement — is a typical topping behavior before a correction. Price has now entered a consolidation phase, which aligns with the beginning of an ABC corrective structure. You might also like: XRP ETF buzz boosts XYZVerse presale momentum as investors eye a potential breakout If this structure plays out, price may begin retracing toward the next key support near $26.53, which coincides with both a lower Fibonacci level and high time frame demand. This level also aligns with prior market structure and serves as an ideal candidate for a macro higher low, allowing the broader bullish trend to remain intact while resetting momentum indicators. Notably, the current move does not show signs of aggressive selling or breakdown — rather, the market is rotating sideways under resistance. This supports the idea that the correction, if it unfolds, may be orderly and offer a chance for accumulation. Unless bulls reclaim the $41.55 zone with strong volume, the path of least resistance remains to the downside for now. What to expect in the coming price action If Hyperliquid fails to reclaim $41.55, a pullback toward the $26.53 support region is likely. This correction would be considered structurally bullish as long as support holds and a higher low is formed. Traders should watch for either an increase in volume near support or a breakout through resistance to confirm the next directional move.

2025-07-01T16:30:17,"Senate Republicans Push For Crypto-Friendly Amendments Amid Budget Bill Discussions","As Republicans rush to pass President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” budget plan, a timely initiative is emerging in Congress that puts cryptocurrency in the spotlight once more. Lawmakers are seeking to attach amendments aimed at providing significant advantages for cryptocurrency investors, contributing to the ongoing shift in the regulatory landscape for digital assets in the country. Fair Tax Treatment For Crypto Miners And Stakers On Monday, Senator Cynthia Lummis, an advocate for the adoption of digital assets, took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter), to voice her concerns about the current tax treatment faced by crypto miners and stakers. The Senator highlighted that these individuals are taxed twice: once when they receive block rewards and again upon selling their assets. “It’s time to stop this unfair tax treatment and ensure America is the world’s Bitcoin and Crypto Superpower,” Lummis stated. This sentiment resonates with President Trump, who has consistently supported the integration of digital assets into the country’s financial system. His administration has proposed the establishment of the nation’s first crypto strategic reserve, which would include Bitcoin (BTC) and other tokens as part of its framework. Fox journalist Eleanor Terret also reported on X that discussions around crypto tax amendments remain alive, despite some disagreements that arose over the weekend. Congressional Divisions Toward Digital Assets Terret indicated that the White House is advocating for the inclusion of Lummis’s proposed changes in the final version of the bill, demonstrating a concerted effort to galvanize support for the cryptocurrency sector. In contrast to Lummis’s approach, Senator Jeff Merkley introduced an amendment aimed at barring elected officials from promoting or profiting from crypto tokens in which they have a financial interest. Merkley argued that allowing such practices undermines the integrity of governance. “The sale of crypto coins by any of us for financial benefit is corrupting our responsibility to govern by and for the people,” he asserted. Lummis opposed Merkley’s amendment, warning that it could stifle American innovation and hinder the government’s ability to effectively understand and regulate digital assets . In a pointed remark in Congress on Monday, the pro-crypto Senator noted, “If we’re serious about ethics and financial products, let’s focus on real solutions and all financial products, not just digital.” Ultimately, Merkley’s amendment was defeated , failing to pass with a vote of 47 to 53, reflecting the ongoing tensions in Congress regarding the regulation of digital assets, as well as the divisions among lawmakers regarding this emerging technology. As of press time, Bitcoin trades at $107,187, up 2% on the weekly time frame. Despite the short-term recovery for the market’s leading crypto, BTC still trades 4% below its record price of $111,800.

2025-07-01T16:27:24,"Is Crypto Ready for Q-Day?","Are you ready for Q-Day? Do you even know what Q-Day is? If you don't, you're sleepwalking into a digital apocalypse that's not coming—it's already here. Q-Day isn't some distant theoretical event. It's the moment quantum computing shatters every lock, breaks every code, and renders every secret naked. While your most powerful supercomputer would need billions of years to crack modern encryption that currently secures crypto wallets, blockchains, digital banking assets, and WhatsApp chats, a quantum computer could do it over lunch. Every ""secure"" transaction, every ""private"" communication, every ""protected"" system becomes an open book. As Jay Gambetta, Vice President of IBM Quantum, warns: ""The quantum threat isn't coming—it's here. Nation-states are harvesting encrypted data TODAY, betting they'll decrypt it tomorrow. If you're not quantum-safe now, you're already compromised."" Your Data Is Already Stolen Let me be brutally clear: whether Q-Day arrives in one year, two years, or five years is completely irrelevant. Why? Because of ""Harvest Now, Decrypt Later"" attacks. Right now, as you read this, malicious nation states and criminal actors are vacuuming up encrypted data including medical records, financial transactions, state secrets, and your personal communications. They can't read it today, but they're betting on quantum to unlock it tomorrow. Computer scientist Deborah Frincke from Sandia National Laboratories doesn't mince words: ""Pretty much anything that says a person is who they say they are is underpinned by encryption. Some of the most sensitive and valuable infrastructure that we have would be open to somebody coming in and pretending to be the rightful owner and issuing commands to shut down networks, influence the energy grid, or create financial disruption."" The Crypto Carnage In May 2025, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager with $11.6 trillion under management, did something unprecedented. They added quantum computing as a critical risk warning to their Bitcoin ETF filing, warning that quantum advances could ""undermine the viability"" of cryptographic algorithms used not just in Bitcoin but across the entire global tech stack. Researchers warn that 4 million bitcoin—roughly 25% of all usable BTC—could be stolen once quantum computers advance enough to break their encryption. Leading quantum expert. It's not just Bitcoin. Ethereum and most blockchains today rely on Elliptic Curve Cryptography, and quantum will shatter that. Experts predict that Q-Day will come within the next five-to-seven years, but it could be sooner. Quantum is coming for bitcoin like meteors came for the dinosaurs. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has already proposed emergency hard-fork solutions for when quantum computers crack Ethereum accounts. The Ethereum blockchain would need to be paused for an unknown time until it's restored to a new quantum-resistant blockchain, a process that could take years. Behind closed doors at private crypto conferences, influential cryptographers and business leaders are concerned about a potential catastrophe where a computer strong enough to reverse engineer wallets' private keys could flood exchanges with ancient Bitcoin, sending prices spiraling. The Infrastructure Apocalypse This isn't about losing your Netflix password. This is about the complete collapse of digital trust across Bitcoin wallets, Ethereum smart contracts, DeFi protocols, banking systems, power grids, military communications, healthcare records, and government secrets. By leveraging its computational power, a quantum miner could consistently solve the mathematical puzzles required to add new blocks to the blockchain, transforming mining from a decentralized global industry into an oligopoly controlled by quantum-capable entities. Some optimists say we have until 2030 before quantum computers can break encryption. They're missing the point entirely. The damage is being done today. Every piece of data transmitted now is a future casualty. According to a December 2023 Reuters report, Tilo Kunz of cybersecurity firm Quantum Defen5e told Defense Information Systems Agency officials that Q-day could come as soon as 2025. Google Quantum AI has already lowered the barrier to breaking widely used RSA-2048 encryption to fewer than one million qubits, dramatically reducing the resources needed for crypto-breaking quantum attacks. The Only Way Forward Forget patches, updates, or hoping someone else will solve this. Quantum resistance must be built into the foundation, not bolted on as an afterthought. We need post-quantum cryptography that can withstand both classical and quantum attacks, quantum-resistant digital signatures using hash-based and lattice-based cryptography, complete blockchain infrastructure overhauls, immediate migration from vulnerable crypto addresses, and action now, not committees discussing action later. QRL’s Iain Wood warns: ""It is now no longer controversial to say that all blockchains that exist by 2035 will have to be post-quantum secure."" Researchers at the University of Kent say that upgrading to post-quantum crypto-systems could take 75 days of downtime for Bitcoin, or over 300 days if the network operated at 75% capacity. Think about what that means for a trillion-dollar asset class. The Bottom Line Q-Day isn't a future problem—it's a present crisis. While everyone's chasing AI dreams, the quantum nightmare is unfolding. The harvest is happening now. The decryption is coming. 2025 is probably our last chance to start migration to post-quantum cryptography before we are all undone by cryptographically relevant quantum computers. Stop asking when Q-Day will arrive. It's here. The only question is: will you be ready, or will you be roadkill on the quantum highway? In the quantum age, there are only two types of data: quantum-safe and future-compromised. For crypto holders, there are only two types of digital assets: post-quantum secured and future-worthless. Your Bitcoin, your Ethereum, your entire crypto portfolio hangs in the balance. The quantum clock is ticking, and every second you wait is another step toward total cryptographic annihilation.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/07/01/is-crypto-ready-for-q-day,"BTC|ETH|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET","Opinion|Opinion",cryptocompare

According to a Bloomberg report citing sources familiar with the matter, the bank will collaborate with the Austrian cryptocurrency exchange Bitpanda to develop this service. This move is integral for Deutsche Bank’s effort to grow in the digital asset market. Deutsche Bank Pushes Effort to Grow in the Crypto Market Sources also confirmed that Bitpanda’s technology team is assisting in building the bank’s storage system for digital assets. This collaboration aims to provide safe storage and management for institutional clients who hold cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. Furthermore, the custody service will meet Germany’s strict regulatory standards, ensuring a high level of security and transparency. Notably, Deutsche Bank’s long-time partner, Taurus, is also involved in this initiative. They will help develop and implement the custody platform. Together, Bitpanda and Taurus aim to create a strong and scalable custody solution. Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank’s new launch comes amid a growing need for regulated crypto services in Europe. Deutsche Börse Enters Into the Crypto Custody Sector In a similar vein, Clearstream, a subsidiary of Deutsche Börse, entered the crypto industry. The company launched a new custody service for institutional investors , enabling them to invest in the digital asset market. This move marked a significant step for Clearstream in strengthening its position in the cryptocurrency market. As reported by TheCoinRise, this service initially supports Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Later on, more cryptocurrencies will be added. It is worth noting that institutional clients now have access to the new service, which provides custody and settlement for digital assets. Clearstream relies on its majority-owned subsidiary, Crypto Finance, to ensure secure handling to manage sub-custody operations. Beyond Compliance: Deutsche Bank’s Growing Crypto Influence Interestingly, the financial giant’s ambition is growing daily. The company has actively forged strategic partnerships in the crypto sector. Recently, it joined forces with Keyrock to enhance the crypto-native market maker’s global services and expand its reach in key regions. Likewise, Deutsche Bank has consistently advocated for blockchain technology to address financial sector challenges, such as margin compression. In 2019, the financial bank joined JPMorgan’s blockchain-based Interbank Information Network . The move reinforced the bank’s role as a leader in adopting blockchain to enhance efficiency and transparency in banking operations.

2025-07-01T16:01:10,"Bitwise Updated Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana Price Prediction for 2025!","Bitcoin and altcoins have faced many challenging obstacles such as US President Donald Trump’s tariff policy in 2025. However, rally expectations for BTC and altcoins remain alive. At this point, Bitwise announced its expectations for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) for 2025. According to The Block, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan updated their 10 predictions for 2025 in a note to their customers. Hougan first stated that there was no change in his Bitcoin prediction and that they maintained their $200,000 target for BTC. While Bitwise expects BTC to reach new highs and eventually $200,000 by the end of 2025, the same has not been true for ETH and SOL. “We remain true to our $200,000 BTC forecast as we expect institutional demand for BTC to be greater from 2024, further driving the BTC price higher. However, we are less confident that Ethereum and Solana will rally and reach new ATHs. However, we expect that the increasing interest in stablecoins, ETF approvals, and the emergence of ETH and SOL treasury companies could push prices significantly higher.” Bitwise announced that in its predictions at the beginning of the year, they set a target of $7,000 for Ethereum and $750 for Solana. Current Status of Predictions! Bitwise CIO listed the latest status of their predictions at the beginning of 2025 as follows: “Prediction 1: Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana are expected to reach new all-time highs and Bitcoin is expected to trade above $200,000. – Still valid for Bitcoin but some hesitations for ETH and SOL. Prediction 2: Bitcoin ETFs will attract more inflows in 2025 than in 2024. – Still valid. Prediction 3: Coinbase will surpass Charles Schwab as the world's most valuable brokerage firm, with its stock price exceeding $700.- It seems unlikely. Prediction #4: 2025 will be the “Year of the Crypto IPO” with at least five crypto unicorns going public in the US – Still valid. Prediction #5: AI-driven token launches will lead to a bigger memecoin craze than in 2024. -Very Low Probability given. Prediction #6: Number of countries with Bitcoin will increase from 9 to 18. -Update: Unlikely. Prediction 7: Coinbase will enter the S&P 500 and MicroStrategy will enter the Nasdaq-100, thus providing cryptocurrency inflow to the portfolio of (almost) every US investor.- It came true. Prediction #8: The U.S. Department of Labor will loosen its guidance against crypto in 401(k) plans, sending billions of dollars into crypto assets.- Come true. Prediction 9: With the passage of long-awaited stablecoin legislation in the US, stablecoin assets will double to $400 billion – it is still too early to reach this goal. Prediction #10: As Wall Street’s crypto adoption intensifies, the value of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) will exceed $50 billion. – Still valid.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-01T16:00:29,"Crypto CEO Had a Vision about What Will Happen to XRP Once Bitcoin Finally Collapses","Edo Farina, the CEO of Alpha Lions Academy and a prominent voice in the XRP community, has shared a thought-provoking vision on X that is now stirring discussion across the crypto space. In his post, Farina predicted a dramatic collapse of Bitcoin, one that would send shockwaves throughout the entire crypto market. But what sets his vision apart is what he believes happens next: XRP, after briefly crashing with the rest of the market, will become the focal point of a new era in digital finance. According to Farina, Bitcoin’s eventual downfall is inevitable. He envisions it triggering a widespread crash where all assets, including XRP, initially suffer. Specifically, he foresees XRP briefly dipping to as low as $0.77 before making a swift and powerful recovery. “The lowest XRP will ever reach is a wick to $0.77 before quickly bouncing back,” he wrote. I had a vision. When BTC finally collapses, the entire market will crash, including $XRP , but only temporarily. The lowest XRP will ever reach is a wick to 0.77$ before quickly bouncing back From the ashes, the Phoenix will rise, and all liquidity will flow into XRP. — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) June 30, 2025 XRP as the Phoenix Rising Farina’s symbolic language casts XRP as the Phoenix, rising from the ashes of Bitcoin’s collapse. This isn’t just about price action; it’s about a complete market restructuring. He claims that once the dust settles, liquidity from across the digital asset ecosystem will begin flowing into XRP, positioning it as the new foundation of the crypto economy. This imagery mirrors long-standing theories that XRP is designed to become a global bridge currency, particularly in institutional finance. The Phoenix metaphor also taps into a widely circulated theory stemming from a 1988 Economist magazine cover, which predicted a “world currency” rising from the ashes of fiat by 2018. While the timeline didn’t materialize, many XRP supporters have adopted the Phoenix concept as a symbol of XRP’s long-term destiny. Not Financial Advice, But a Track Record to Watch In a follow-up post, Farina tempered his message: “Don’t take this as financial advice or too seriously, just a vision I wanted to share. Many of my past visions have already come true.” Though he distances himself from offering official investment guidance, his followers are quick to point out that previous predictions he made have aligned closely with major market events. This blend of intuition and perceived foresight is part of what gives his statements such weight in the XRP community. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Question of Bitcoin’s Sustainability Farina’s vision is rooted in a growing skepticism about Bitcoin’s long-term viability . Critics frequently point to Bitcoin’s energy consumption, limited transaction speed, and lack of direct utility as potential Achilles’ heels. If regulatory scrutiny or technological evolution renders these flaws unsustainable, Bitcoin’s dominance, currently over 50% of the total crypto market cap, could falter. Farina suggests that in such a moment of weakness, investors and institutions may shift toward utility-driven assets like XRP. A Speculative Yet Compelling Outlook Though Farina’s statements are speculative, they resonate with the hopes and convictions of XRP supporters who believe the asset is still undervalued and misunderstood. His vision doesn’t merely forecast a price rally; it imagines XRP as the cornerstone of a restructured financial ecosystem, built from the ruins of Bitcoin’s collapse. Whether seen as prophecy, bold speculation, or metaphorical insight, his post has reignited the debate about what truly comes next for crypto—and for XRP in particular.

2025-07-01T15:58:46,"Altcoins Face Final Correction: Is a Major Surge Next?","Bitcoin (BTC) could be getting ready to make a big surge to the upside, surmounting its all-time high, and heading into price discovery. Altcoins are not going to be left behind, and signs are that some of the top alts could be about to outperform. Higher lows for altcoins, but previous bull market high must be surpassed Source: TradingView The weekly chart for Total2 (combined market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies excluding $BTC) shows a series of higher lows since the bull market began in early January 2023. This has not been broken, even during the big 49% correction from December 2024 through to April 2025. An ascending trendline has also continued to be respected throughout this bull market, and big horizontal support levels are doing their job thus far. Be that as it may, the current altcoin bull market has still not equaled the highs of the last bull market that topped in November 2021. That $1.7 trillion top will need to be surpassed if the altcoins are going to continue to climb higher in successive bull markets. That said, perhaps things will begin to change now. In all probability, at least 99% of the current crop of altcoins are likely to go to zero, given the real lack of proper use cases. Bitcoin dominance just keeps going up Source: TradingView The Bitcoin dominance chart (BTC.D) illustrates just how difficult things have been for the altcoins, even from before the start of the bull market. An inexorable rise in Bitcoin dominance was only punctuated by one big 11% swing back to the altcoins in November 2024. Other than that, the trend has been upward. 68% and then 70% dominance levels could be next. Some of the best altcoins will outperform With all this said, there are very likely going to be certain altcoins that will not only have their boats floated by the rising tide of Bitcoin, but they may outperform the king of the cryptocurrencies into the bargain. Why could they do this? The main reason is the vastly inferior market caps compared with $BTC. The $ETH market cap is around 7x less, while the $SOL market cap is only $79 billion, compared with $BTC’s $2.12 trillion. Other layer 1s and fundamentally good altcoins have an even greater disparity compared with Bitcoin. Therefore, the cream of the altcoins (perhaps with some of the hot air memecoins) could make much bigger percentage gains than Bitcoin, going into this potentially last stage of the bull market. In order to take advantage of these outperformers, it’s not about watching how they perform against a weakening USD pair, it’s about carefully measuring how they square up to their BTC pairs. Look for breaks of trend against BTC, and bounces from strong support levels. If your particular altcoins are not beating $BTC, they just aren’t worth holding on to.

The new exchange is fully compliant with MiCAR requirements, with no obstacles to trading digital assets in the Euro Area. Bybit officially launched Bybit.eu , a platform specifically dedicated to traders from the European Economic Area (EEA). The new platform launched about a month after Bybit secured a MiCAR license , allowing it to offer services compliant with EU regulations. JUST IN: @Bybit_Official set to launch a MiCAR-compliant crypto-trading platform in Vienna, Austria, and across 29 EEA countries. pic.twitter.com/QuHHHtmJJC — Cryptopolitan (@CPOfficialtx) July 1, 2025 Bybit.eu will be operated under Bybit EU GmbH, a fully licensed Crypto-Asset Service Provider under the current MiCA regulations. The launch of a European platform is a milestone for Bybit, which already has a significant global presence. ‘ Bybit.eu is our long-term commitment to Europe, ’ said Mazurka Zeng, managing director and CEO of Bybit EU GmbH. ‘ Europe deserves a world-class crypto gateway that balances technology with robust regulatory standards. That’s exactly what Bybit EU delivers. ’ The market operator will have its headquarters in Vienna, Austria, and will branch out to 29 potential markets, offering crypto access to over 450M Europeans. Currently, the EU market is fragmented, with smaller local platforms and additional access to some of the larger market operators. A full MiCAR license also means no surprising shocks to trading, and a certainty that all traded crypto assets have passed the compliance requirements. Bybit tailors its services to European users The new trading platform is compliant with all requirements for investor protection, transparent reporting, and capital reserves. Bybit.eu offers a brokerage service with deep liquidity from multiple partnering markets. The European site taps the available liquidity from multiple sources, tapping tools backed by Bybit’s global scale. The platform will also be localized in several major European languages. Support will be available 24/7 with live assistance in English, Polish, Portuguese, and Spanish, with upcoming rollouts in German, French, Italian, and Romanian. The company will also open regional offices in several European countries. Bybit.eu will also offer VIP accounts for high-volume traders, crypto custody, and reward and incentive programs, all of which are compliant with EU requirements. The products will be available to all EEA markets except for Malta. Bybit to tap local blockchain talent Bybit aims to build on Europe’s wider acceptance of crypto. The platform will invest in local communities and tap EU-based talent. Bybit.eu aims to serve as a trusted partner for blockchain developers, institutions, and end users. The exchange aims to help Europe shape the future of digital finance. Bybit has stated it aims to become a catalyst for wider crypto adoption in Europe. The European platform will exist as a separate entity, as Bybit currently runs a signup campaign. For now, European users can still access their global program accounts, but some are calling to create special new accounts on Bybit.eu . Existing users can use their current global Bybit identity to register and prepare to fulfill the KYC requirements. Current Bybit traders from the EU are advised to close all positions and prepare to transfer to the new platform, which will separate EU-based traders from the global platform.

2025-07-01T15:34:44,"DDC secures $528m for its corporate Bitcoin accumulation strategy","DDC Enterprise, best known for its Asian food brands, has entered the big leagues. With a half-billion-dollar war chest and heavyweight backers, the company is making an audacious play to dominate corporate Bitcoin holdings. In a press release on July 1, NYSE-listed DDC Enterprise announced the initial closing of its $528 million capital raise, backed by institutional heavyweights including Anson Funds, Animoca Brands, and Kenetic Capital. The financing marks one of the largest Bitcoin ( BTC )-dedicated raises by a publicly traded company and includes a mix of convertible notes, private placements, and an equity line of credit, all earmarked for aggressive BTC accumulation. The move puts DDC on a radically different path from most consumer-facing companies. It also cements its position as one of the few public firms outside of tech or crypto sectors to aggressively restructure around Bitcoin. You might also like: Bitcoin set for ranged trading as Q3 begins: Bitfinex DDC’s radical Bitcoin transformation According to the press release, the initial closings of DDC’s $528 million financing package includes a $26 million PIPE investment from crypto-native institutions like Animoca Brands and Kenetic Capital, a $25 million convertible note from Anson Funds (with $275 million more available), and a $2 million private placement. Perhaps most strategically significant is the $200 million equity line of credit, giving DDC dry powder to accumulate Bitcoin opportunistically during market dips. This isn’t just treasury diversification; it’s a full-scale financial pivot. While DDC maintains its Asian food brands like DayDayCook and Yai’s Thai, its balance sheet is being radically reshaped. The company’s previous announcement in June made its ambitions clear: “Substantially all of the capital raise will be dedicated to expanding the Company’s Bitcoin treasury.” CEO Norma Chu’s vision leaves little room for ambiguity: “This maximum aggregate $528 million capital commitment marks a watershed moment for DDC. With premier institutions such as Anson Funds, Animoca Brands, and Kenetic Capital backing our vision, we believe we have unprecedented capacity to execute our mission of building one of the world’s most valuable corporate Bitcoin treasuries and becoming a top global Bitcoin holder.” DDC’s bet hinges on Bitcoin’s long-term appreciation outpacing traditional investments. With spot ETFs funneling institutional money into BTC and the 2024 halving historically preceding bull cycles, DDC’s timing aligns with a macro narrative gaining Wall Street credence. Yet risks loom: regulatory uncertainty, Bitcoin’s volatility, and the specter of illiquidity if markets swing erratically.

2025-07-01T15:30:24,"Here’s What Will Happen If The Bitcoin Price Can Manage A Clean Break Above $108,500","A crypto analyst has forecasted a powerful Wave 3 Bitcoin price rally that could take it toward new all-time highs between $160,000 and $200,000. Notably, this surge is expected to come with rising Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) and a delayed altcoin season, particularly if BTC can make a clean break above the $108,500 resistance level. Bitcoin Price Breakout To Spark Next Bull Run The Bitcoin price is currently hovering below a critical resistance level at $108,500, and according to a crypto analyst known as ‘BigMike7335’ on the X social media platform, a clean breakout and flip of this level into support could ignite an explosive Wave 3 bull run. Based on Elliott Wave Theory and Fibonacci Extension analysis, a successful move above this threshold could open the door to a bullish price surge with potential targets set in the $160,000 to $200,000 range. Related Reading: Bitcoin Flashes Double Top Above $106,000: FVG Says A Large Crash Is Coming The analyst’s chart shows that Bitcoin has already completed its Wave 1 of a five-wave impulse move, followed by an ABC corrective Wave 2. The market is also currently consolidating, and Bitcoin’s bullish momentum appears to be rebuilding. These positive developments are supported by a rising Stochastic Relative Strength Index (RSI) from the oversold region and a neutral-to-bullish RSI, both of which point toward upward price action. Notably, the 0.618 and 1.0 Fibonacci Extensions around $117,795 and $137,421, respectively, are highlighted as interim resistance zones where price momentum could temporarily slow before continuing upward. A clean breakout above $108,500 could also place Bitcoin above a heavy volume node visible in the volume profile within the chart, suggesting less overhead resistance and a stronger potential for a price rally. Furthermore, the analysis implies that during this powerful Wave 3 phase, Bitcoin Dominance will likely climb toward 70%. This increase in BTC.D would mean capital is concentrating in the leading cryptocurrency, which historically results in altcoins underperforming. As a result, the expected altcoin season for this cycle may be postponed, following the completion or cooling of Wave 3. Analyst Predicts $375,000 Bitcoin Bull Run Peak Crypto analyst TechDave has just sounded the alarm on what he calls the Bitcoin “launch signal”, a rare trigger that has only appeared four times in history and each time marked the start of major bull market rallies. This signal previously appeared in October 2012, July 2016, and July 2020—all preceding major upward moves that ended in new cycle peaks. Related Reading: Fading Spot Volumes And Muted Futures Sentiment Threaten To Send Bitcoin Below $99,000 Again Currently, the same signal is emerging this July, aligning with the previous cycle structures and reinforcing the expectation of a breakout phase. Notably, the formation has led to exponential gains, with each bull market run typically peaking months later. Following this historical pattern, TechDave now predicts a fresh cycle top for Bitcoin at $375,000.

It was emphasized that in the three years of decline, losses remained only in single digits. In particular, strong double-digit rallies were observed in five of these seven years of increase. $116,000 Target on the Agenda As July approaches, optimism and bullish expectations increase in the market, and according to Matrixport’s analysis, this historical trend may show itself again. The company shared its view that the Bitcoin price could test the $116,000 level in the coming weeks. This expectation is based on both past performance and the increase in investor sentiment in July.
