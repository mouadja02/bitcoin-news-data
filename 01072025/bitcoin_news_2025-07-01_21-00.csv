2025-07-01T18:50:43,"Strategic Bitcoin ETF Acquisition: Sixty Six Capital Boosts Crypto Holdings to 126.8 BTC","BitcoinWorld Strategic Bitcoin ETF Acquisition: Sixty Six Capital Boosts Crypto Holdings to 126.8 BTC In a significant move that underscores the growing institutional appetite for digital assets, Sixty Six Capital , a prominent investment firm listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE), has announced a substantial increase in its Bitcoin holdings. This strategic acquisition highlights the firm’s commitment to expanding its exposure to the burgeoning cryptocurrency market, particularly through regulated investment vehicles like a Bitcoin ETF . If you’ve been watching the crypto space, you know that institutional participation is a key indicator of market maturity, and this latest development from Sixty Six Capital certainly adds another layer to that narrative. What’s Driving Sixty Six Capital’s Bold Bitcoin ETF Strategy? On June 30, Sixty Six Capital revealed in a press release that it had acquired an additional 96,000 units of BTCC.B, a well-known Bitcoin (BTC) Exchange Traded Fund. This latest purchase translates to approximately 13.5 BTC, a notable addition to their portfolio. For those unfamiliar, BTCC.B is an ETF that provides investors with exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This makes it an attractive option for institutional players like Sixty Six Capital, who seek regulated and accessible pathways into the digital asset space. The firm’s decision to deepen its investment in a Bitcoin ETF like BTCC.B isn’t just a random act; it aligns perfectly with their stated focus on crypto and AI assets. This move demonstrates a clear long-term vision, positioning them to capitalize on the potential growth of both sectors. It’s a calculated step that reflects confidence in Bitcoin’s future trajectory and its role within a diversified investment portfolio. How Does This BTC Investment Impact Their Crypto Holdings? This recent acquisition significantly bolsters Sixty Six Capital ‘s overall digital asset exposure. With the addition of 13.5 BTC, the firm’s total BTC investment -equivalent holdings have now surged to an impressive 126.8 BTC. To put this into perspective, this isn’t just a small speculative play; it represents a substantial commitment to Bitcoin as a core asset. The consistent accumulation of Bitcoin, especially through a regulated product, signals a strategic approach to managing their crypto holdings . It suggests that the firm views Bitcoin not merely as a volatile speculative asset, but as a legitimate store of value and a potential hedge against traditional market uncertainties. This growing treasury of Bitcoin could also serve as a foundational asset for future ventures or strategic partnerships within the crypto ecosystem. Why Are Institutional Bitcoin Holdings on the Rise? Sixty Six Capital ‘s move is part of a broader trend of increasing institutional Bitcoin adoption. Investment firms, corporations, and even some sovereign wealth funds are beginning to allocate portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin. Why? Several factors are at play: Accessibility: Bitcoin ETFs like BTCC.B offer a regulated and familiar investment vehicle, removing the complexities of direct crypto custody and management. Inflation Hedge: Many institutions view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation, given its finite supply and decentralized nature. Diversification: Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional assets can offer portfolio diversification benefits. Maturing Market: The cryptocurrency market is becoming more regulated and liquid, making it more palatable for institutional capital. This growing confidence from major players is a crucial indicator for the wider market, often preceding broader retail adoption and infrastructure development. The more institutions enter, the more legitimacy and stability the crypto market gains. The Strategic Play of a Crypto Investment Firm Sixty Six Capital is not just any firm; it’s a crypto investment firm that explicitly targets both crypto and AI assets. This dual focus positions them at the forefront of two of the most transformative technologies of our time. Their latest Bitcoin acquisition is a testament to their belief in the long-term value proposition of digital assets, especially Bitcoin, which is often seen as the foundational layer of the crypto economy. Their strategy appears to be one of consistent accumulation during market opportunities, leveraging regulated products to minimize operational risks. This methodical approach is a stark contrast to the more speculative retail trading often seen in the crypto space, highlighting a sophisticated understanding of market dynamics and long-term value creation. What Challenges and Opportunities Lie Ahead? While the acquisition is positive, the crypto landscape is not without its challenges. Market volatility remains a key concern, and regulatory uncertainty in various jurisdictions can impact sentiment. However, for a firm like Sixty Six Capital , these challenges also present opportunities. Dips can be seen as accumulation opportunities, and clearer regulations could pave the way for even greater institutional inflows. The opportunity lies in being an early mover in a rapidly evolving asset class. By building substantial crypto holdings now, Sixty Six Capital is positioning itself to benefit significantly from future market appreciation and the continued mainstreaming of digital assets. Actionable Insights for Investors What can individual investors learn from Sixty Six Capital ‘s strategic move? Consider Diversification: Explore how digital assets, even a small allocation, might fit into your long-term portfolio strategy. Research Regulated Products: For those uncomfortable with direct crypto ownership, explore Bitcoin ETF s or other regulated investment vehicles available in your region. Long-Term Vision: Institutional moves often reflect a long-term perspective, emphasizing holding over short-term trading. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on institutional adoption trends as they often signal market maturity and future growth areas. A Compelling Future for Institutional Crypto Sixty Six Capital ‘s recent acquisition of 13.5 BTC via the BTCC.B ETF is more than just a transaction; it’s a powerful signal. It underscores the growing confidence among sophisticated investors in Bitcoin as a legitimate and valuable asset class. As a dedicated crypto investment firm , their strategic accumulation of institutional Bitcoin holdings reflects a proactive approach to capturing future growth in the digital economy. This move, increasing their total crypto holdings to 126.8 BTC, reinforces the narrative that digital assets are steadily becoming a staple in modern investment portfolios, moving from the fringes to the mainstream.

In a new interview with CNBC, Ark CEO Cathie Wood shares her outlook on the US economy. “Well, I think we have been climbing a wall of worry. I mean, a lot of people expected tariffs and wars and the controversy between the Fed and the President to really shake markets up. And of course, there has been some volatility. But these are the kinds of bull markets that I think are the most durable, when the market climbs through all of that controversy. It’s really signaling something. And I think the things that it’s signaling are: interest rates probably are coming down. And I think what many people are not focused on in the inflation statistics are the housing numbers. And they get in there with a long lag. We think that the shift, or the concentration toward just a very few stocks– which was a very unhealthy bull market – that is changing, and the market is broadening out. And I think deregulation is probably one of the most important things that this administration is doing to unleash animal spirits.” When asked what she thinks about opposing views – that the economy is doing fine – Wood points to housing and manufacturing numbers before making her prediction that this will all transition smoothly into a recovery. “Well, I think we’ve been pretty consistent on this idea that we’ve been through a rolling recession. If you look at housing, which is actually having a little bit of a relapse today, housing plummeted in 2022 when interest rates shot up, and it has not recovered. Manufacturing has not recovered. And so we do believe that they will recover as interest rates come down, deregulation takes hold, and some certainty about tax cuts and so forth occurs – including immediate expensing, perhaps, of capital goods, which would be very positive. So we think we’ll move from a rolling recession into a recovery.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-01T18:40:45,"Ethereum ETF Staking: SEC’s Crucial Delay Fuels Market Uncertainty","BitcoinWorld Ethereum ETF Staking: SEC’s Crucial Delay Fuels Market Uncertainty The cryptocurrency world holds its breath as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) once again hits the pause button on a pivotal decision. This time, it’s the highly anticipated Bitwise proposal to include staking in its spot Ethereum ETF , a move that could reshape how investors access the second-largest digital asset. The news, initially reported by @PhoenixNewsIO on X, highlights the regulatory body’s cautious approach, which also saw a postponement for the 21Shares spot Dogecoin ETF. What does this mean for the future of crypto investments, and why is the SEC taking its time? What’s the Latest on the Ethereum ETF Staking Proposal? For months, the crypto community has been buzzing with anticipation surrounding the approval of spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds. Following the landmark approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, many believed Ethereum would be next in line. However, the path for Ethereum appears to be fraught with additional complexities, primarily due to its transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and the integrated concept of staking. Bitwise, a prominent asset manager, submitted a unique proposal that sought to incorporate a staking component into its spot Ethereum ETF. This means that, if approved, the ETF would not only hold physical Ethereum but also stake a portion of it to earn yield, potentially passing those returns on to investors. This innovative approach aims to offer a more comprehensive exposure to Ethereum’s ecosystem. The SEC’s latest move, a delay in its decision, indicates a need for more time to thoroughly review the implications of such a structure. Why is the SEC Decision Taking So Long? The SEC’s prolonged deliberation on the Bitwise Ethereum ETF with staking is not entirely unexpected. The agency operates under a mandate to protect investors and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets. When it comes to novel financial products like crypto ETFs, especially those involving staking, the SEC faces several unique challenges and concerns: Investor Protection: The SEC scrutinizes whether investors fully understand the risks associated with staking, including smart contract vulnerabilities, slashing penalties, and the illiquidity of staked assets. Market Manipulation: Concerns persist about the potential for manipulation in the underlying spot markets for cryptocurrencies, even with Ethereum’s significant market capitalization. Custody and Security: Staking introduces additional layers of complexity regarding the custody of assets and the security protocols required to protect staked ETH. Classification of Staking: A fundamental question for the SEC is whether staking rewards or the act of staking itself constitutes a security offering under U.S. law, which would bring it under a different regulatory framework. The approval process for a spot Bitcoin ETF was relatively straightforward in comparison, as Bitcoin operates on a Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism without staking. The transition of Ethereum to PoS adds a new dimension that the SEC must carefully evaluate. Key Differences: Bitcoin vs. Ethereum ETF Approval Process Feature Bitcoin Spot ETF Ethereum Spot ETF (with Staking) Consensus Mechanism Proof-of-Work (PoW) Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Yield Generation No inherent yield generation Staking offers yield Regulatory Complexity Primarily market manipulation concerns Market manipulation, staking classification, custody of staked assets Precedent Grayscale court ruling was pivotal New territory for staking within ETFs Broader Implications for the Crypto ETF Landscape The SEC’s cautious stance extends beyond Ethereum. The simultaneous delay of the 21Shares spot Dogecoin ETF application underscores a broader regulatory hesitancy towards a wider range of digital assets. While Bitcoin’s approval created a precedent, it did not open the floodgates for all cryptocurrencies. Each asset and its unique characteristics, particularly its consensus mechanism and associated activities like staking, are subject to individual scrutiny. This ongoing delay for the Crypto ETF applications could mean a slower, more deliberate rollout of diversified crypto investment products in the U.S. It signals that the SEC is not simply rubber-stamping applications but is taking a measured approach to ensure regulatory clarity and investor protection in a rapidly evolving market. Diving Deeper into the Bitwise Ethereum Proposal Bitwise Asset Management has been a proactive player in the crypto ETF space, being one of the first to file for a spot Bitcoin ETF and now pushing the boundaries with its Ethereum staking proposal. Their strategy is to offer investors not just exposure to the price movements of ETH but also the potential to earn passive income through staking rewards, mirroring the benefits of directly holding and staking Ethereum. The inclusion of staking in an ETF product presents significant operational and regulatory hurdles. How would the staking rewards be managed? What are the tax implications for investors? How would the ETF ensure liquidity for redemptions if a significant portion of its ETH is locked up in staking? These are complex questions that Bitwise and the SEC are likely grappling with during this review period. The success of the Bitwise Ethereum ETF with staking could set a crucial precedent for future yield-bearing crypto products in the traditional finance world. The Complexities of ETH Staking and Regulatory Scrutiny ETH staking is a fundamental aspect of Ethereum’s post-Merge network. It involves locking up ETH to support the network’s security and operations, for which participants earn rewards. While attractive for its passive income potential, integrating staking into a regulated ETF product introduces several layers of complexity: Benefits of Staking for Investors (if integrated into an ETF): Passive Income: Potential to earn yield on ETH holdings, enhancing overall returns. Network Security: Contributing to the stability and security of the Ethereum network. Accessibility: An ETF could make staking accessible to traditional investors without the technical complexities of self-staking. Challenges for ETFs Incorporating Staking: Liquidity: Staked ETH is typically locked for periods, impacting the ETF’s ability to meet redemptions. Slashing Risk: Penalties for validators’ misbehavior could lead to loss of staked ETH. Centralization Concerns: Large institutional stakers could raise concerns about network decentralization. Regulatory Classification: The ongoing debate whether staking rewards constitute unregistered securities. The SEC’s decision will likely hinge on how these challenges are addressed and whether the proposed structure adequately protects investors from the unique risks associated with ETH staking within a regulated product. Market Reaction and Future Outlook The market’s reaction to the latest delay has been relatively muted, as such postponements have become a common occurrence in the crypto ETF approval saga. However, the underlying sentiment remains one of cautious optimism. Analysts generally anticipate that spot Ethereum ETFs will eventually gain approval, though the timeline for those including staking remains highly uncertain. Many experts point to May 2024 as a critical window for a final SEC decision on several spot Ethereum ETF applications, including those from VanEck and Ark Invest/21Shares, though these do not currently include staking. The Bitwise proposal with staking adds another layer of complexity that might require more time. Investors should brace for continued volatility and further delays as the SEC navigates this uncharted regulatory territory. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts While the wait for a spot Ethereum ETF with staking continues, here are some actionable insights for those interested in the crypto market: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on SEC filings and announcements from asset managers. Regulatory developments are key drivers of market sentiment. Understand the Nuances: Differentiate between pure spot ETFs and those with staking components. Each carries different risk profiles and potential benefits. Consider Direct Staking (with caution): For those comfortable with the technical aspects and risks, direct ETH staking remains an option, but understand the implications of locking up your assets. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t place all your investment hopes on a single regulatory approval. The crypto market offers a vast array of opportunities. A Glimpse into Tomorrow: The Evolving Crypto Landscape The SEC’s decision to delay the Bitwise Ethereum ETF staking proposal is a reminder that the integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional finance is a gradual, complex process. While frustrating for some, these delays underscore the regulatory body’s commitment to due diligence in a nascent yet rapidly maturing asset class. The eventual approval of such products, especially those incorporating yield-generating mechanisms like staking, would mark a significant milestone, opening doors for broader institutional and retail adoption. The journey towards fully regulated and innovative crypto investment vehicles continues, characterized by a delicate dance between technological advancement and regulatory prudence. The crypto market remains dynamic, promising both challenges and immense opportunities for those who stay informed and adaptable.

Its mainnet launch signals a new phase in the evolution of Bitcoin’s utility beyond store of value. According to a press release , Botanix Labs has officially launched its Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible Bitcoin ( BTC ) Layer 2 mainnet, backed by a decentralized federation of 16 node operators, including Galaxy, Fireblocks, and Antpool. The network, which processed over 26 million testnet transactions since December 2024, now supports live applications like GMX and Dolomite, with average fees hovering at $0.02. Unlike other Bitcoin L2 solutions that launched under centralized control, Botanix’s “Spiderchain” architecture ensures no single entity, including its own developers, can manipulate user funds. “Too many Bitcoiners have been burned by centralized platforms, which is why Botanix is fully decentralized at launch. No single party, including us, can touch a user’s Bitcoin, and that’s why I’m incredibly excited to see mainnet go live and finally put real tools into the hands of Bitcoiners. If we want a world that runs on Bitcoin, we have to build systems that honor its core principles of self-custody, open participation, and global fault tolerance,” Willem Schroé, CEO and Co-Founder of Botanix Labs, stated. You might also like: DDC secures $528m for its corporate Bitcoin accumulation strategy The Spiderchain experiment: can Botanix finally make Bitcoin programmable? While other Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions have launched with trade-offs like centralized sequencers, federated bridges, or wrapped assets, Botanix took a different path. The network’s “Spiderchain” architecture, a novel cryptographic primitive, creates a web of multisig wallets that secure the network without relying on a single custodian. Every Bitcoin block triggers a new multisig setup, distributing control across its federation of node operators without resorting to centralized bridges. This structure underpins Botanix’s five-second finality and sub-cent fees while preserving native Bitcoin custody, putting it on par with Ethereum L2s like Arbitrum and Optimism. Already, major DeFi protocols like GMX and Dolomite have deployed on the network, offering Bitcoin-native trading and lending, something previously only possible through risky BTC-pegged tokens on Ethereum. If the network is successful, it could finally unlock Bitcoin’s dormant potential beyond being digital gold. But in a market where even Ethereum struggles with L2 fragmentation, Botanix’s real hurdle won’t be technology. It’ll be proving that Bitcoiners actually want smart contracts. The next few months will reveal whether this is the breakthrough Bitcoin needs or another ambitious solution in search of a problem.

This brings its total Bitcoin holdings to 773.58 BTC. With this amount, the UK-based company is now among the top 40 public firms holding the most Bitcoin. The company aims to grow long-term value and become a major force in digital finance. Smarter Web’s Major Bitcoin Purchase Adds to Its Growing Treasury The company’s newest Bitcoin purchase was completed for £17.97 million, equivalent to $24.6 million. It was revealed that each top coin was purchased for an average price of £78,103, equivalent to approximately $107,126. The Smarter Web Company has spent a total of £60.4 million, equivalent to $82.7 million, on all its crypto purchases to date. On average, each Bitcoin was bought for £78,022, equivalent to $107,015. Although the current market price for the flagship crypto is slightly lower at $106,963, the company remains committed to its Bitcoin treasury policy. Due to its rapid accumulation of Bitcoin, the company now ranks 36th among 135 publicly traded companies that hold the top cryptocurrency worldwide. The firm is nearing the 1,000 BTC mark, a milestone that only a few companies, such as Strategy, have achieved. The Virginia-based firm now holds 597,325 BTC after adding 4,980 more to its stash. Smarter Web Charts a Bold New Path The Smarter Web Company started out offering web design, development, and digital marketing services. It earns revenue through service setup fees, annual hosting plans, and optional monthly support. In 2023, the company began accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment. In April 2025, the Smarter Web Company became a listed firm on the Aquis Stock Exchange through a reverse takeover. It also took a major turn by adopting a Bitcoin treasury policy. This decision aligns with the company’s belief that the top coin will play a major role in the future of global finance. Following the news of its Bitcoin treasury strategy, the firm’s share price jumped by nearly 20,000%, reaching a high of £605. This sharp increase pushed its market value from just £3.7 million, equivalent to approximately $5 million, to over £1 billion, or around $1.4 billion. However, the stock later dropped by almost 70%, then stabilized around £249.75. Leading the UK’s Corporate Bitcoin Movement Though most of the largest corporate Bitcoin holders are U.S.-based, UK firms are starting to follow the same path. The Smarter Web Company currently leads among UK businesses with 773 BTC in its treasury. It stands ahead of Phoenix Digital Assets, Coinsilium, and Jersey-based CoinShares, which have 247 BTC, 74 BTC, and 236 BTC, respectively. This indicates a growing interest in digital assets among British firms, with more businesses expected to follow a similar path.

After a challenging period, the king of cryptocurrencies surged an impressive 41% from its April low, pushing its Bitcoin price well above the $107,000 mark. This incredible ascent fueled optimism, leading many to anticipate a continued parabolic rise. However, as with any dynamic market, the tides can turn, and recent signals suggest a potential shift in momentum. Is this merely a pause, or are we witnessing a more significant change in Bitcoin’s trajectory? Understanding the Current Bitcoin Price Action: A Shift in Dynamics? For weeks, the narrative surrounding Bitcoin was one of relentless ascent. Every dip was met with strong buying interest, propelling the Bitcoin price higher and higher. This robust performance cemented its position as a leading indicator for the broader crypto market. Yet, recent observations from prominent analysts, including those at Bitfinex, indicate a subtle but crucial change in market dynamics. The once-unwavering buying pressure appears to be weakening, giving way to an increase in selling activity, particularly from a specific segment of holders. This isn’t necessarily a cause for panic, but rather an invitation for careful consideration. Markets rarely move in a straight line forever. Periods of rapid appreciation are often followed by phases of consolidation or even correction. The current sentiment suggests we might be entering one such phase, where the market digests its recent gains and re-evaluates its direction. Why is the BTC Rally Losing Steam? The Role of Profit-Taking One of the primary drivers behind the perceived loss of momentum in the BTC rally is the noticeable increase in profit-taking . While a healthy part of any market cycle, its intensity and source can offer valuable insights. Analysts point to short-term holders, those who entered the market when Bitcoin was trading below the $80,000 level, as key contributors to this selling pressure. Having witnessed substantial gains, these investors are now cashing out, securing their profits. Consider the following dynamics contributing to this trend: Short-Term Holder Behavior: These investors are typically more reactive to price movements, aiming to capitalize on quick gains. Once their target profit margins are met, they are more likely to sell. Market Psychology: After a significant run-up, there’s a natural inclination for some participants to lock in gains, especially if they anticipate a potential pullback or simply wish to de-risk. Lack of New Catalysts: While the rally was strong, a lack of immediate, powerful new catalysts might lead existing holders to believe the immediate upside is limited, prompting them to sell. This behavior, while understandable from an individual investment perspective, collectively creates selling pressure that can slow or even reverse a rally. The Critical Role of Crypto Market Analysis in Spotting Trends How do experts like those at Bitfinex identify these shifts? It boils down to meticulous crypto market analysis , which involves scrutinizing various on-chain and off-chain metrics. It’s not just about looking at the price chart; it’s about understanding the underlying forces of supply and demand, investor sentiment, and liquidity. Key indicators that signal a potential shift include: Spot Trading Volume: A decline in spot trading volume often suggests reduced conviction among buyers and sellers. When volume drops during an uptrend, it can indicate that fewer new participants are entering the market to sustain the rally. Conversely, a high volume during a price drop can signal strong selling pressure. Taker Buy Pressure: This metric reflects the aggressive buying activity in the market. Taker buys are market orders that immediately execute against existing limit orders. A diminishing taker buy pressure indicates that buyers are becoming less aggressive in their purchases, or there simply aren’t enough new buyers willing to ‘take’ the available sell orders at current prices. Funding Rates and Open Interest: While not explicitly mentioned in the original snippet, these derivatives market metrics are also crucial. Negative or declining funding rates in perpetual futures, coupled with decreasing open interest, can signal a bearish sentiment or reduced speculative interest. By observing these and other metrics, analysts can paint a clearer picture of the market’s health and anticipate potential turning points, helping investors make more informed decisions. Navigating Increased Profit-Taking: What Does it Mean for Investors? The rise in profit-taking , particularly from short-term holders, is a natural part of the market cycle. It suggests that a significant portion of the recent gains has been realized. For investors, this means the market might be entering a phase of consolidation. What does consolidation entail? Consolidation is a period where the asset’s price trades within a relatively narrow range, often after a significant upward or downward move. It’s a time for the market to ‘catch its breath,’ absorb new information, and for supply and demand to find a new equilibrium. This can be a healthy development for long-term sustainability, as it helps to shake out weaker hands and build a stronger foundation for future growth. During consolidation, investors might observe: Reduced volatility compared to the preceding rally. Price bouncing between clear support and resistance levels. A period of uncertainty, as the market awaits new catalysts or a clear breakout direction. For those looking to enter the market or add to their positions, a consolidation phase can present opportunities to buy at more stable price points, rather than chasing a rapidly rising asset. What Declining Trading Volume Tells Us About Market Health The decline in trading volume is a significant indicator that should not be overlooked. Volume is often considered the ‘fuel’ of price movements. A strong rally typically sees increasing volume, indicating broad participation and conviction. When volume starts to wane during an uptrend, it suggests that fewer participants are willing to buy at higher prices, and the existing rally is being sustained by a smaller pool of committed buyers. Here’s a simple analogy: Imagine a car climbing a hill. If the engine starts to sputter and consume less fuel, it’s a sign that the ascent might be slowing down or even reversing. Similarly, declining volume in an uptrend can signal that the underlying buying power is diminishing. This makes the price action less reliable and more susceptible to sudden reversals or corrections. Conversely, if a price drop occurs on high volume, it signals strong selling conviction. If a price drop occurs on low volume, it might indicate a temporary pullback rather than a strong bearish reversal. In the current scenario, the declining volume accompanying the weakening rally suggests a decrease in overall market participation and enthusiasm at these higher price levels. Actionable Insights for Investors in a Shifting Market So, what should investors do when the BTC rally shows signs of fatigue and profit-taking becomes prevalent? Here are some actionable insights: Re-evaluate Your Strategy: If you’re a short-term trader, this might be a time to consider securing some profits or adjusting stop-loss orders. For long-term holders (HODLers), consolidation can be a test of conviction, but also an opportunity to accumulate more Bitcoin if you believe in its long-term potential. Focus on Key Support Levels: Identify crucial price levels where strong buying interest has historically emerged. These can act as potential floors if the price continues to decline. For example, the $80,000 level, where many short-term holders bought in, could become a significant psychological and technical support level if the market pulls back further. Diversify (Carefully): While Bitcoin remains dominant, consider if your portfolio is overly concentrated. However, avoid panic-selling into other assets without thorough research. Stay Informed: Continue to follow reliable crypto market analysis from reputable sources. Understanding macro-economic trends, regulatory news, and on-chain data will be crucial. Practice Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Use stop-loss orders, manage your position sizes, and have a clear exit strategy. Patience is Key: Markets move in cycles. A consolidation phase can be frustrating, but it’s a natural part of healthy growth. Impulsive decisions often lead to losses. The Road Ahead: Consolidation or Correction? The current signals suggest that Bitcoin is likely entering a consolidation phase rather than immediately resuming its sharp upward trajectory. This period of sideways movement can be beneficial, allowing the market to build a stronger base before its next significant move. However, there’s always the possibility that increased profit-taking and sustained low trading volume could lead to a deeper correction. The key will be to watch how demand responds at critical support levels. If buying interest returns strongly at these levels, it could confirm a healthy consolidation. If these levels break, it might signal a more pronounced pullback. Ultimately, the market is a complex interplay of human psychology, economic factors, and technological developments. Conclusion: Navigating Bitcoin’s Evolving Landscape Bitcoin’s recent rally has been nothing short of spectacular, but the emerging signs of weakening momentum and rising profit-taking warrant attention. As trading volume declines and buyer enthusiasm wanes, the market appears to be transitioning into a consolidation phase. This shift, highlighted by astute crypto market analysis , is a natural part of market cycles, offering a chance for the Bitcoin price to stabilize and gather strength for its next move. For investors, understanding these dynamics and adopting a patient, informed approach will be crucial to navigating the evolving landscape of the BTC rally . While the immediate future might involve less dramatic upward movements, the long-term narrative for Bitcoin remains compelling for many, predicated on its fundamental strengths and growing adoption.

In a new report, Bitwise executives Matt Hougan and Ryan Rasmussen double down on their prediction that Bitcoin will hit $200,000 within six months, a more than 88% increase from its current value. “It’s been a mixed year for crypto asset prices… We’re optimistic, however, that things are setting up for a very strong H2 (second half of the year). Progress in D.C. around crypto legislation, rising demand from institutional investors for crypto exposure and extreme bullishness around stablecoins are combining to create a strong environment for gains. The bottom line: we’re holding firm to our BTC $200,000 prediction, as there is simply too much institutional demand for BTC to keep prices flat for long.” The investors also say that there are bullish catalysts that may spark explosive rallies for Ethereum ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ) in the second half of 2025. However, they are unsure if ETH and SOL can hit fresh all-time highs. “We’re less confident on ETH and SOL, but hope that rising interest in stablecoins, ETF (exchange-traded fund) approvals and the emergence of ETH and SOL treasury companies can drive prices substantially higher.” Bitcoin is trading for $105,996 at time of writing, down 1.5% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, ETH is trading for $2,423 at time of writing, down 2% on the day, and SOL is trading $147 at time of writing, down 6.8% in the last 24 hours. The analysts also believe that top US crypto exchange Coinbase will eventually trade for $700 per share and surpass Charles Schwab’s total value, but that it’s unlikely to occur this year. “COIN’s stock has done well, doubling Schwab’s market return (44% against 22% for the old-school brokerage)… Schwab’s stock has done a bit better than we expected. As a result, the gap between Coinbase’s value ($90 billion) and Schwab’s value ($164 billion) is probably too wide to cross by year-end.” COIN is trading for $337 at time of writing. Lastly, the executives are also staying committed to their prediction that the market cap of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) will surpass $50 billion this year. “Tokenized RWAs were a $13 billion market at the start of 2025. Today, they’re at roughly $25 billion.

2025-07-01T18:00:12,"Bitcoin Network Volume Echoes Mid-2021 ‘Stable Equilibrium’ – Is A Big Move Brewing?","After rebounding from a local bottom of around $75,000 in April, Bitcoin (BTC) appears to be stuck in the $100,000 to $110,000 range, showing little indication of a clear directional trend. One key data point reflecting this indecision is Bitcoin’s network volume. Bitcoin Network Volume Stuck In Balance Zone According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor AxelAdlerJr, Bitcoin’s network volume has stabilized in a state of ‘stable equilibrium,’ reminiscent of the mid-2021 consolidation phase that preceded a major move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Binary CDD Hints At Healthy Consolidation, Not A Top For the uninitiated, Bitcoin network volume refers to the total value of BTC transferred across the blockchain over a specific period, typically used to gauge market activity and capital flow. Higher network volume suggests increased investor engagement and liquidity, while lower volume may indicate reduced interest or market stagnation. Notably, when BTC reached the upper end of its current range – around $110,000 – its average network volume surged to as high as $67 billion. Since then, the metric has slightly declined and now hovers around $58.7 billion. Since January 2024, Bitcoin’s average network volume has ranged between $40 billion and $80 billion. According to the CryptoQuant analyst, this corridor has become a key indicator of network activity balance and broader market sentiment. Historically, when the Bitcoin average volume approached the upper-end of the range at $80 billion, it coincided with local price peaks of $70,000 and $100,000. On the contrary, moves toward the lower-end – around $40 billion – were associated with short-term pullbacks, though these dips were often quickly bought up by market participants. Currently, the $58.7 billion reading sits near the midpoint of this range, mirroring the consolidation phase observed in mid-2021. The analyst explained: As long as the indicator remains above the $40 billion level, we can speak of a stable fundamental market condition. Rising volumes above the $80 billion mark will confirm strengthening activity and fresh capital inflow. On the other hand, a sustained drop below $40 billion will indicate weakening network demand and may be a harbinger of a deeper correction. Is BTC Preparing For A Big Move? While Bitcoin network volume suggests the market is in a state of equilibrium, some on-chain metrics hint at a potential breakout building in the background – possibly paving the way for renewed bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Poised For Rally As Geopolitical Tensions Ease And Inflation Expectations Fall For example, the BTC short-term holder floor has been rising steadily in recent months, currently hovering around $98,000.

2025-07-01T17:58:40,"Bitcoin Pulls Back to $106K After Record Monthly Close","Bitcoin slid on Tuesday as weakness in U.S. tech stocks appeared to spill over into crypto markets. The crypto asset fell about 1% over the past 24 hours, trading at $106,175 at press time as traders took profits after ending June above the $107,000 for its highest-ever monthly close. Sentiment equally soured in equities with shares of Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA) both taking heavy losses, dragging the Nasdaq lower by about 0.6% — a pattern that often weighs on digital assets. Tesla was lower by 5.4% in afternoon trade after the Donald Trump/Elon Musk spat re-erupted alongside the momentum for passage of the GOP's spending bill. Major altcoins including Solana SOL, Cardano ADA and Avalanche AVAX posted steep declines, adding to a broader downturn across the crypto space.

Powell's comments Tuesday were of particular import given what's now a clear split between him and at least two other Fed members, both of whom would like to see a July rate cut on the table. Powell did allow that a rate cut this month isn't off the table, but gave little indication he's considering easing policy in July.

Since July 1, it is offering a five-year, dollar-denominated structured note referenced to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), specifically tailored for sophisticated investors. The product, available for sale until July 28, is fully capital-protected at maturity—providing risk-conscious investors with access to the upside potential of Bitcoin without the volatility generally linked to crypto markets. A Gateway to Bitcoin with Low Volatility In contrast to conventional crypto holdings, UniCredit’s certificate is crafted for institutional investors apprehensive of price volatility and regulatory uncertainty. Supported by IBIT, which manages more than $73 billion in assets, the product offers a liquid, regulated access to Bitcoin markets—without wallet or token ownership. According to Bloomberg in a report based on an internal memo, the offering is a “low-friction” gateway for digital assets—ideal for Italian wealth managers needing compliant, traditional-type products. Why This Matters for Europe’s Financial Sector UniCredit’s move represents an evolving institutional shift. As BlackRock’s IBIT listed on Euronext Paris and Xetra in March, interest in Bitcoin has surged among European institutions. But many are still holding back due to regulatory and custody concerns. By wrapping Bitcoin exposure in a familiar TradFi product that shields capital, UniCredit may set the standard for how Europe’s banks come to digital assets.

2025-07-01T17:54:29,"Bitcoin falls below $106K weighing under resistance, HFT, SOLX, MAV leads altcoins","Bitcoin continued its weakness on Tuesday as the leading cryptocurrency in the world by market capitalisation weighed under the resistance zone of $108k. The broader cryptomarket was down 1.59% to $3.27 trillion on Tuesday. The Coin Market Cap crypto fear and greed index is still in neutral territory at 50 from 52 yesterday, showing signs of fatigue in the crypto market. What’s with Bitcoin Bitcoin was down 1.33% to $106,177.46 on Tuesday. The US financial markets were also down on Tuesday as US President Donald Trump’s new spending bill, The Big Beautiful bill which was narrowly passed by the US Senate. The markets were cautious on the $3.3 trillion tax cut bill, which is poised to add to the US’s mounting fiscal deficit. Bitcoin has recently consolidated below a significant resistance level near $108,350. This price point aligns with the upper boundary of its current trading range. Despite attempts to move higher, the price has remained capped at this level. Technical indicators suggest a potential bearish divergence, which may indicate a reduction in the upward momentum of the recent rally. Should selling pressure increase at this level, the price could revert towards the lower boundary of the trading range, approximately $100,960. Price action and resistance Bitcoin’s inability to sustain a move above $108,350 has resulted in the formation of a potential lower high. This development aligns with a bearish price structure that has been observed over the past several weeks. The $108,350 level has demonstrated itself to be a notable barrier, with multiple price rejections confirming it as an area where supply has been dominant. Without a decisive breakthrough above this level, the price is more likely to continue trading within its established range. Technical indicators and volume trends A bearish divergence has been noted, characterized by a slight increase in price while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows weakening momentum. This pattern is often considered an early indication of potential exhaustion in a rally, particularly when it occurs at a key resistance level. Such a divergence suggests that the recent upward movement may have been driven more by short-term factors than by sustained buying interest. Furthermore, trading volume has shown a consistent decline during this period of consolidation. In the context of established technical resistance and the developing divergence, this diminishing volume could reinforce a bearish outlook. For a significant upward breakout to occur, a corresponding increase in volume would typically be required to confirm a shift in demand. Without such confirmation, the price may be more likely to decline and test subsequent support levels, including the point of control and potentially the value area low at $100,960. Current data points indicate Bitcoin is encountering resistance at approximately $107,565, aligning with a pivot point, and also at the 23.6% Fibonacci level around $107,664. The emergence of a bearish divergence is further supported by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 54.4, which, while neutral, shows a downtrend from 56.1 yesterday. Concurrently, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram, at +269, suggests that bullish momentum may be decelerating despite remaining positive. Strategy’s faith in Bitcoin being tested? Another event that shook some confidence for Bitcoin holders is that Microstrategy, one of the strongest corporate backers of Bitcoin, transferred $796 million worth of BTC to three new wallets. Blockchain analysis platform Lookonchain said 7382 BTC was transferred on Sunday, but no official explanation has been given. The question that arises in the mind of BTC investors is whether Michael Saylor, who has been a strong advocate of BTC, has now started selling his positions. Microstrategy remains the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin with holdings of 592,345 BTC, equivalent to about $64.28 billion. Altcoins The altcoin market capitalization fell to $1.29 trillion from $1.32 trillion in the previous day. CoinMarketCap’s altcoin season index fell from 21 yesterday to 20 today, deeply affirming the strength of the Bitcoin season. Ethereum fell by 2.20% to $2,430.75 at the time of writing. Solaxy (SOLX), Hashflow (HFT), and Maverick Protocol (MAV) were the top gainers. SOLX rallied by 77%, HFT popped 40% while MAV gained 14%. Solaxy, which was listed on Uniswap on June 24, had a strong start, but faltered after that. The layer 2 network on the Solana chain exhibited strong movement on Tuesday. Hashflow gained due to its Solana integration and Binance listing, which boosted its accessibility and credibility.

U.S. stocks were mixed after President Trump’s budget bill passed the U.S. Senate. On Tuesday, June 1, Dow Jones was up 340 points or 0.77%. At the same time, the S&P 500 retreated from its record highs, losing 0.11%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.61% Traders were mostly focused on the progress with trade talks and Donald Trump’s massive budget bill, which passed the Senate . Senate members voted 51-50 on the bill, with Vice President JD Vance breaking the tie, setting the stage for the House vote. The bill will provide trillions in tax cuts while lowering spending on Medicaid, food stamps, and clean energy. What is more, the bill would add an estimated $3.3 trillion to the nation’s deficit, which caused Republican Senators to vote against it. Fiscal conservatives Rand Paul, Susan Collins, and Thom Tillis were the three dissenters.

Musk, a former Trump ally, reignited his feud with the President, calling the bill “utterly insane and destructive.” Notably, Musk was a major beneficiary of the U.S. subsidies to clean energy, especially to electric vehicles like those produced by his company, Tesla. In response to the criticism, Trump threatened to look into Musk’s lucrative contracts with the U.S. government, including those related to SpaceX, another of his firms.

2025-07-01T17:50:09,"Public companies ramp up Bitcoin holdings as Strategy sets the pace","Corporate treasuries have overtaken exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Bitcoin accumulation for the third consecutive quarter, marking a continued shift in institutional strategy as more public companies adopt BTC as a core treasury asset. Publicly held companies added some 131,000 coins in the second quarter of 2025 alone, according to the data provider Bitcoin Treasuries , expanding their total stash of the digital currency by 18%. ETFs also added 8%, or about 111,000 BTC, during the same period. Those institutional buyers who are beginning to get exposure to BTC through ETFs have different motivations than public companies, suggested Nick Marie, head of research at Ecoinometrics. So while the institutions focus on market exposure, the public companies buy Bitcoin to maximize shareholder value. Marie emphasized that market fluctuations or macro trends have less influence on corporate buyers. He noted that the buyers don’t care if the price is high or low—they care about growing their Bitcoin treasury, so they look more attractive to the proxy buyers. In April, a turbulent market month following President Donald Trump’s tariff announcement, the public company BTC holdings grew by 4% compared to 2% growth among ETFs. Public companies ramp up Bitcoin holdings as Strategy sets the pace Public companies currently hold around 855,000 BTC, or 4% of Bitcoin’s fixed supply, while ETFs collectively hold more than 1.4 million BTC, accounting for 6.8% of the total supply. The ETF market saw its major boom after its US approval in January 2024, one of history’s most successful ETF rollouts. Still, Strategy—the company formerly known as MicroStrategy—remains the torchbearer of the BTC treasury movement , now holding 597,000 BTC. It continues to influence a growing group of over 140 public companies globally that have followed its playbook. “Strategy is going to be the preferred landing spot for institutional capital because of the deep liquidity around their equity,” said Ben Werkman, CIO at Swan Bitcoin. “But smaller companies still offer strong upside potential for early investors.” The surge in corporate BTC buying has been accelerated by regulatory clarity under the Trump administration. In March, Trump signed an executive order establishing a US Bitcoin reserve, signaling federal support for the cryptocurrency and helping alleviate lingering reputational concerns. The second quarter saw new corporate entrants into the Bitcoin market. GameStop began acquiring BTC following board approval in March. On the other hand, KindlyMD merged with Bitcoin investment firm Nakamoto. ProCap, led by Anthony Pompliano, also launched a BTC acquisition program via SPAC ahead of its public listing. Long-term viability of Bitcoin treasury Strategy faces growing scrutiny Despite the current momentum, some experts are skeptical of the long-term sustainability of corporate BTC treasuries. Marie warned the trend might be transitory. The more companies adopt the model, the more diluted the impact becomes. Over time, BTC may become so normalized that proxy investors won’t need to rely on these firms for exposure. Werkman noted that many investors are betting on leveraged Bitcoin equities as a way to outperform the digital asset itself, due to corporate access to capital markets and their ability to issue shares to finance further BTC accumulation. Werkman added that companies like Strategy will also convert treasury assets to BTC without using leverage. He says that gives them the ability to back shares with Bitcoin and company performance—a rare combination. As more companies weigh the risks and benefits of holding BTC on their balance sheets, the race to replicate Strategy’s success story appears far from over, especially in a regulatory climate warmer to crypto than ever before.

2025-07-01T17:35:00,"Solana rejected at $178 resistance — can $105 support hold the Double Bottom?","Solana is testing a major resistance zone near $178, which has triggered multiple rejections. If price fails to break through, the path opens toward $105.89 — a level that may form a bullish double bottom if defended. Market structure and volume behavior suggest further downside is likely unless bulls reclaim control quickly. Solana ( SOL ) is currently trading below the $178 resistance, a level that aligns with both the value area high and a key high time frame supply zone. Since establishing the local swing high, price action has formed lower highs and lower lows — a bearish pattern signaling weakness. If this rejection holds, the next major area of interest sits around $105.89, where a structural double bottom could develop and signal a potential trend reversal. Key technical points, $178 Resistance Rejection: Price faces high time frame resistance in confluence with the value area high Double Bottom Setup: Key support at $105.89 may provide reversal if tested and held Auction Rotation in Play: Backtest of value area high increases probability of rotation to value area low SOL/USDT (1D) Chart, Source: TradingView The rejection from $178 continues to weigh on Solana’s price structure. Despite several pushes higher, buyers have failed to gain control above this resistance zone. The confluence of the value area high and high time frame resistance makes this region particularly significant, and failure to break above it has confirmed short-term bearish structure. You might also like: Base protocol Limitless raises $4M, backed by Coinbase Ventures and Arthur Hayes Price has now started to rotate lower, and from an auction theory perspective, the loss and backtest of the value area high suggests that the market may seek balance by moving toward the value area low. This would bring price into the $105.89 zone — a high time frame support level that also represents a key structural low. A sweep of this area, followed by strong buyer response, could establish a double bottom pattern, often a reliable reversal signal. Another concern for bulls is the local trend, which continues to form lower highs and lower lows beneath resistance. If price fails to reclaim lost levels soon, it increases the probability of continuation to the downside. Still, a test of $105.89 isn’t inherently bearish — it may instead offer a key pivot point for Solana to reset and build strength for another move higher. What to expect in the coming price action As long as Solana trades below $178, the probability of further downside remains elevated. A move toward $105.89 is likely, and if this level holds, it could form a double bottom and launch a rotation back toward resistance. Failure to defend this support, however, would confirm a breakdown and risk shifting the larger trend bearish. Watch for volume signals near the lows to confirm buyer interest.

2025-07-01T17:30:58,"Bitcoin naysayers say Strategy is taking part in ‘financial gibberish’","Michael Saylor’s crypto-centric company, Strategy, is projected to report an unrealized gain of approximately $14 billion for the second quarter of 2025, credit given almost entirely to a 30% surge in Bitcoin prices. Much different from corporations like Amazon and JPMorgan Chase, which generate billions through traditional operations, Strategy’s anticipated earnings result primarily from digital asset exposure. According to a Tuesday report from Bloomberg, the company could bring in just $112.8 million in revenue from its legacy software business during Q2 2025. Bitcoin price rally fuels earnings surge The projected profit for the quarter ending June 30 is largely attributed to Bitcoin’s rise, which saw prices increase from about $82,444 at the end of March to more than $106,000 by late June. At the beginning of the quarter, Strategy held 528,185 BTC, translating to over $43.5 billion in value. When Bitcoin appreciated, the market value of those holdings rose by more than $13 billion. A series of smaller weekly Bitcoin purchases during the quarter added an additional $600 million to unrealized gains, Bloomberg calculations show. On June 30, the company disclosed a major purchase of 4,980 BTC for approximately $531.9 million, at an average price of $106,801 per Bitcoin. These purchases were funded through proceeds from the sale of MSTR Class A shares and preferred equity vehicles STRK and STRF. The latest purchase brings Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 597,325 BTC, acquired for $4.40 billion at an average price of $70,982. At current market rates, the company’s unrealized gains total nearly $21.8 billion, with the portfolio now valued at $64.3 billion. Strategy software and crypto business flourish Over the last five years, Michael Saylor has moved Strategy from a business intelligence software firm towards a highly leveraged proxy for Bitcoin investments. His BTC accumulation methodology includes stock and debt issuance, convertible notes, and, most recently, preferred share sales. According to Bloomberg analysts, the first quarter of 2025 was a turning point for the company when it implemented a new accounting rule requiring Bitcoin to be valued at market prices. Under the previous system, Bitcoin was treated as an intangible asset, forcing companies to record impairment losses when prices fell, while unrealized gains were not recognized unless the asset was sold. The change allowed Strategy to record Bitcoin’s quarterly volatility in its earnings. It had counted a $4.2 billion loss in Q1 when Bitcoin declined by 12%, but the current quarter is expected to reverse that with an exponential profit. Bitcoin naysayers say Strategy is taking part in ‘financial gibberish’ According to short-seller Jim Chanos, investors should short Strategy stock for buying Bitcoin directly, arguing that the premium on the company’s shares compared to its crypto holdings is unjustified. Speaking in an interview late June, he said Saylor’s valuation model is “nothing more than financial gibberish.” Since Saylor initiated the Bitcoin strategy in mid-2020, when the firm was still called MicroStrategy, its share price has surged more than 3,300%. Over the same period, Bitcoin has gained roughly 1,000%, and the S&P 500 has seen an uptick of around 115%. In the second quarter alone, Strategy’s shares rose 40%, compared to an 11% gain in the broader S&P index. Following the Q1 loss, multiple class-action lawsuits have been filed against Strategy, alleging that executives misled shareholders. In a recent SEC filing, the company said it plans to “vigorously defend against these claims.” Saylor’s playbook has inspired several companies, including Sharplink Gaming Inc. and BitMine Immersion Technologies, which have both begun accumulating other cryptos like Ether and Solana, seeking to replicate Strategy’s crypto-treasury model.

2025-07-01T17:30:03,"Ripple CTO Drops Bombshell On Pre-IPO Shares As Linqto Meltdown Explodes","Linqto’s once-celebrated promise to “democratize” (Ripple) pre-IPO investing is collapsing under the weight of federal probes, a looming bankruptcy filing and a furious customer base that now numbers roughly 13,000. According to an internal review first detailed by The Wall Street Journal, investigators for the Securities and Exchange Commission and the US Department of Justice are examining allegations that former chief executive William Sarris secretly marked up Ripple shares by more than 60 percent, sold customer stock without permission and promoted deals to thousands of investors who failed to meet accredited-investor standards. New management concedes that client accounts have been frozen since February and warns that a Chapter 11 filing could leave many investors as unsecured creditors. A March 14 press release from the company’s new leadership confirmed “pervasive securities-law violations,” the pausing of all trading and the dismissal of nearly half the staff while Linqto “explores all options to preserve value,” including court-supervised restructuring. The same statement insists that the special-purpose vehicles (SPVs) holding customers’ assets remain on issuer cap tables, but concedes that an independent forensic review is under way to verify that claim. Into that vacuum stepped attorney John E. Deaton , who told his X followers that the situation is a “total clusterfuck” and that roughly 11,500 Linqto users bought units in SPVs that, in turn, were supposed to own Ripple shares. Deaton says as many as 5,000 of those investors are non-accredited, creating “a regulatory compliance nightmare” now squarely on the SEC’s radar. He plans to host a live session at 3 p.m. EST today to detail what he calls a “heavily involved” enforcement action and to explain why simply refunding principal would strip investors of six- and seven-figure gains booked on private-share price appreciation. “You Never Owned Ripple Shares”— CTO Ripple’s chief technology officer David Schwartz—better known online as “JoelKatz”— added fuel to the blaze by reminding holders that they never owned Ripple equity outright. “You don’t own the shares directly,” Schwartz wrote, “but you own a portion of a legal entity that owns the shares.” He elaborated, saying: “So if you ‘bought’ Z shares, you own X fraction of a legal entity with Y shares where X×Y=100. This generally lets you buy ‘shares’ more easily and in smaller quantities, but the equivalent per-share price is usually higher.” This clarification dismantled a key misconception among many Linqto clients who believed they were holding Ripple stock directly. The implications are now being examined not only by the SEC but also by customers who fear their indirect ownership could be rendered illiquid or encumbered in bankruptcy court. When pressed about whether those SPVs could be affected by Linqto’s financial collapse, Schwartz responded: “The legal entity that owns the shares that you own part of should not have exposure to Linqto going bankrupt. So a direct encumbrance on the shares to cover Linqto’s debts shouldn’t happen. But the entity may face operational challenges depending on exactly how it’s structured.” That operational risk is precisely what has many investors on edge. If trustees, custodians, or record-keepers tied to those SPVs are forced to restructure, change providers, or liquidate assets, investors may find themselves in prolonged legal limbo with no access to their holdings—even if the shares remain technically intact on the cap table. The Alleged George Soros Link Complicating perceptions further, Schwartz addressed a separate thread linking billionaire George Soros to Ripple. He clarified that Soros Fund Management backed PolySign—another private company in which many Linqto users invested—during its 2022 acquisition of fund administrator MG Stover, but said he was “not aware of any Soros connection to Ripple.” Initially, Schwartz wrote: “It wouldn’t surprise me very much since his funds own bits of almost everything (Salesforce, Amazon, Google, JP Morgan, Goldman, Uber, FedEx, and many more), but I couldn’t find any actual connection.” However, after further reflection, he corrected himself: “Oh, wait, I remember now. Yes, Soros’ fund did invest in PolySign to help finance the acquisition of MG Stover! No connection to Ripple AFAICT though.” The deeper regulatory concern is structural. Linqto created more than 500 SPVs, each designed to pool hundreds of retail investors while keeping the underlying issuer’s shareholder count below the 2,000-owner threshold that triggers public-reporting obligations. Internal emails obtained by investigators show former executives exhorting staff to “take no prisoners” in sales campaigns—at times buying back Ripple shares from customers at $55 each, only to flip them to Ripple for $61, banking an $8 million spread. If those shares never made it into the SPVs—as suggested in confidential memos cited by investigators—questions of beneficial ownership, tax liability and voting rights could embroil Ripple itself in discovery. What happens next will hinge on three converging clocks: Linqto’s restructuring timetable, the SEC’s enforcement calendar and the pace at which SPV trustees can—or cannot—demonstrate clean title to almost half a billion dollars’ worth of private-company shares. Until then, thousands of would-be Ripple shareholders remain locked out of their accounts, watching from the sidelines as a legal and regulatory cyclone decides whether their “pre-IPO dream” survives or is wiped out in a courtroom ledger.

2025-07-01T17:10:04,"Man charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud of $1.2 million worth of BTC","Tushal Rathod, a 44-year-old man from Van Buren, NY, has been charged by the FBI with laundering counterfeit checks amounting to $1.7 million. His former partner, a mother of his six-year-old child, reported to the FBI that she saw suspicious screenshots on his device, which included evidence of crypto transactions and conversations in other languages. According to a court filing by FBI special agent Samuel Morgan, Rathod allegedly received $1.2 million worth of BTC through a network of seven bank accounts at six different financial institutions. His former partner noticed the scheme after Rathod repeatedly complained about his bank accounts being closed. Man charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud Tushal Rahod has been charged with multiple counts, including conspiracy to commit wire fraud, money laundering, and conspiracy to commit money laundering, by the FBI. The alleged crimes took place between November 2021 and June 2024. In his court filing, Samuel Morgan revealed that as part of the investigations, the FBI had obtained records from Google for tushal27@gmail.com, Apple iCloud accounts belonging to the same email, and kluvbb110011@gmail.com, all via court order. FBI special agent Morgan alleged that Rathod incorporated two companies he used in the scheme. In 2016, Rathod registered T3 Telecom, LLC, a telecommunications company that tested and deployed network devices. He also incorporated TSV Telecom Constructions LLC in 2021. Morgan added that between April 2022 and June 2024, the accused received over $1.7 million in suspected fraudulent proceeds from business email compromise (BEC) fraud and counterfeit checks. The accused received the funds through six different financial institutions, with five accounts belonging to T3 Telecommunications and one for TSV Telecommunications. BEC fraud originates from compromised employee login credentials through spear phishing. Scammers intercept information about the company’s upcoming payments and deceive vendors into completing payments through fake domains. Rathod used at least $1.2 million of the proceeds to purchase Bitcoin and sent them to different external addresses. Three financial institutions contacted him in 2022, including Wells Fargo, notifying him that the money received into his account was unauthorized and would proceed to close the account. Later that year, M&T Bank also contacted Rathod and informed him of the fraudulent funds, but he replied with a fake invoice to justify the funds as legitimate income. The accused stopped contacting M&T Bank after learning police records had been filed. Rathod faces a 20-year jail term if convicted Tushal Rathod, the accused, allegedly recruited other people to aid his plan, including his former girlfriend, the owner of the iCloud account associated with kluvbb110011@gmail.com, to create businesses and open business bank accounts. According to the court filing by Samuel Morgan, Rathod recruited his family members too between May and July 2024 to assist in the scheme, which resulted in an additional $1 million deposited into accounts controlled by his girlfriend and family members. Citibank has been able to recover $800,000 worth of fraudulent funds. Morgan explained that in his training and experience, he could identify fraudsters who conduct BEC scams, often working with an extensive network of launderers to help them. He added that the scammers work with others to use multiple bank accounts to move money in a series of convoluted transactions that make it hard to identify the source or who controls the funds, referring to the plot as layering or funneling. Rhode Island real estate law firm was the first victim of the BEC scam reported in 2022, having lost approximately $163,298. The victim received an email that impersonated an employee at Northpointe Bank, directing the victim to send funds to an account supposedly belonging to a Mortgage Company, Carrington Mortgage, associated with a valid real estate transaction. California Credit Union was also involved in the scheme as the second victim, losing approximately $8 million to bank accounts controlled by other scammers.

The investment vehicle, linked to IBIT, adds credibility to a market still wrestling with regulatory caution. According to a Bloomberg report on July 1, UniCredit SpA will issue a five-year, dollar-denominated investment certificate tied to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), exclusively for professional clients in Italy. The offering, available from July 1 to 28, includes full capital protection at maturity, providing a critical feature for risk-averse institutions. Unlike speculative crypto products, this structured note is designed to give investors Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) upside without direct exposure to its notorious volatility. Citing an internal memo, Bloomberg noted that the structured product will serve as a low-friction access point to digital asset markets, without requiring direct crypto custody or wallet infrastructure. You might also like: Upbit and Naver Pay team up to launch Korean won stablecoin Why UniCredit’s Bitcoin bet could reshape European finance UniCredit’s move can be interpreted as a calculated response to shifting institutional demand. BlackRock’s IBIT, now holding over $73 billion in assets according to SoSoValue data, has proven that Bitcoin is no longer a fringe gamble but a mainstream allocation. By linking its certificate to IBIT, UniCredit is anchoring its offering to what is arguably the most established and liquid vehicle for bitcoin exposure in traditional finance today. The choice of a five-year term, full capital protection, and dollar denomination reflects the kind of design meant to reassure cautious allocators who’ve long viewed crypto as an off-limits asset class. For Italy’s wealth managers, that’s an elegant solution: all the upside, none of the regulatory or security risks. The bank’s decision also reflects a broader trend in European finance. Since BlackRock listed its Bitcoin ETP on Euronext Paris and Xetra in March, institutional interest has quietly surged. But many asset managers remain hesitant because they lack compliant pathways to invest. UniCredit’s product may solve that problem by wrapping Bitcoin exposure in a familiar, capital-protected format. If successful, it could become the blueprint for other risk-averse European banks still sitting on the sidelines.

Despite the uncertainty, he remains optimistic, noting that both Bitcoin and BTC dominance are showing strength that could benefit ETH in the near term, with $2,800 marked as the next major resistance. Mixed Signals Across Ethereum Key Timeframes In the post, CRYPTOWZRD pointed out a mixed close for Ethereum across key timeframes. While the monthly candle ended indecisively, signaling some short-term hesitation, the quarterly candle closed with strong bullish conviction. This, he suggests, sets the stage for more upward movement in the coming months as higher timeframes begin to assert dominance. Related Reading: Ethereum Gears Up For Breakout Above $2,800 – Bullish Momentum Builds He emphasized that today’s daily candles for both ETH and ETHBTC closed similarly indecisive, reflecting the current uncertainty in the market. However, with Bitcoin dominance starting to decline, he sees potential for ETHBTC to pick up strength, which could, in turn, fuel Ethereum’s next leg up. According to CRYPTOWZRD, ETHBTC is already showing signs of life, moving upward from a monthly double-bottom formation. He believes that clean, bullish candles forming from the 0.02270 BTC region would inject fresh momentum into Ethereum, helping to drive it toward the $2,800 resistance, a key level on the radar. He added that unless any negative fundamental developments occur, $2,400 remains Ethereum’s main daily support zone. As long as this holds, the broader structure remains intact, and the bullish thesis stays valid. Looking ahead, CRYPTOWZRD plans to keep his attention on the lower timeframes tomorrow. With volatility in play and setups brewing, he’ll be watching closely for quick scalp opportunities as Ethereum navigates through this critical range. Waiting On Chart Confirmation For The Next Intraday Move In his closing remarks, the analyst noted that Ethereum’s intraday chart experienced heightened volatility throughout the day. Despite the choppy price action, he sees clear setups forming that could present solid trading opportunities in the near term. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Eyes High Timeframe Close – Range Break Above $2,800 Could Be Violent A decisive breakout and close above the $2,550 resistance level would be a strong bullish signal, potentially opening the door for a long entry. On the flip side, if the price pulls back toward the $2,380 support and forms a bullish reversal pattern, that too could serve as a valid trigger for a long position. With these scenarios in mind, the analyst plans to closely monitor the intraday chart. His focus will be on spotting a clean and high-quality setup, one that aligns with price structure and momentum to time the next scalp trade effectively.

Second prize is $850,000 and $150,000 in cash. And additionally, I was going to [get] a Mercedes SUV.” However, the victim says he was told he had to meet someone at his bank and hand over money to receive it. He says he followed the instructions and was met by a thief who walked with him into a Chase Bank branch in Northwest Portland. “I said, how much money do you need? He said $10,000. I said, what’s that for? He said, well, we need people to insure the car, give it license plates, install the plates. It sounded reasonable at the time.” The scam didn’t stop there. He says the thief got him to come back later that day and withdraw another $1,500, as well as go to CVS to buy three $500 gift cards. However, he says that when his wife, Iris, came home and he told her about the situation, she realized he had been scammed. She says the bank teller should have figured out her husband may have been a victim of fraud before letting him withdraw the funds. Says Iris, “When I got home he said, ‘I have good news for you. We won Publishers Clearing House. We’re going to get a big check.’ After that, I had a meltdown. None of this would have happened if the teller had called a manager. None of this would have happened, and it’s not like he looks like a young man. There was a man, like, shadowing him.” A Chase Bank spokesperson says the firm is looking into the matter. The Portland Police are also investigating. Says the victim, “I used to be a very bright guy, and I feel very stupid now having bought this.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-01T16:50:11,"Major European provider of crypto ATM services pauses operations in Germany","Leading Bitcoin ATM installer in Europe, Kurant, is pausing operations in Germany as it’s waiting for a new license under the EU’s latest regulations. While the company made it clear this is not a permanent measure, the move is taking most of the Federal Republic’s crypto teller machines out of service. Bitcoin is unavailable at ATMs across Germany Kurant, the Austrian firm that currently runs the highest number of cryptocurrency ATMs in Europe, is temporarily halting operations in Germany. Starting from July 1, Bitcoin will no longer be available for purchase at ATM locations across the country, the German crypto news outlet BTC Echo reported, quoting a press release on Monday. The company has a pending application for a license under the European Union’s new Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) law, and that has been cited as the main reason for its decision. Kurant’s ATMs will be out of service until the licensing process is completed, the announcement revealed. No information was provided as to how long this is going to take. While informing users it’s taking “a short break,” the operator noted it needs it to prepare for the new MiCA requirements, which “involve major technical and legal changes.” In a statement, its Managing Director, Stefan Grill, described the introduction of the set of EU rules as “an important step towards regulating the crypto market,” which he welcomed. He also assured: “We have already initiated the necessary measures to fully comply with the new standards.” Grill added that the temporary pause of services was a “responsible and necessary” move to ensure a smooth and safe transition. “We are taking this step early to be best prepared for the new regulatory framework – ensuring an even better user experience in the future,” Kurant explained on its website. Transactions initiated before July 1 will be completed as usual, and no new transactions will be possible until operations resume, the company highlighted, without providing a specific date for that, although it promised customers to post timely updates. Kurant to relaunch with new features Once it secures a MiCA license, Kurant intends to restart its machines with new features and offerings. “This includes a broader product range and improved services,” it stated. With over 300 devices, the company is Europe’s top operator of teller machines supporting cryptocurrencies. More than half of those are in Germany, which has a little over 150 Bitcoin ATMs in total, according to the tracking website Coin ATM Radar. Kurant made it clear that the pause is not affecting other EU nations where it maintains a presence: “As the European market leader, we will continue offering our services without interruption in Austria and Spain. Naturally, customers in those countries will also benefit from the upcoming new features.” The Austrian firm is a major player on the Old Continent, but the region as a whole is yet to catch up with North America in terms of crypto ATM numbers. With more than 30,000 locations, the United States is still the unchallenged global leader, accounting for over three-quarters of the world’s total, which now exceeds 38,000. Nevertheless, Bitcoin ATM installations in Europe have seen a steady growth over the past decade and are currently at their all-time high, with nearly 1,800 machines as of July 1, 2025. On average, a new cryptocurrency ATM is launched somewhere in the European Union almost every day, as Cryptopolitan recently reported . Unlike regular bank ATMs, the Bitcoin teller machines (also abbreviated as BTMs) offer users the opportunity to buy, and in some cases also sell, major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). They have been offering a simple way to get into crypto. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

2025-07-01T16:44:09,"In the Last Three Months, Companies Bought Way More Bitcoin Than ETFs – What Does This Mean? Experts Explain","Institutional interest in Bitcoin is shifting. Public companies are buying more Bitcoin than exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the third quarter in a row, continuing to embrace the strategy pioneered by MicroStrategy. According to Bitcoin Treasuries data, public companies purchased approximately 131,000 BTC in the second quarter of 2025, increasing their total assets by 18%, while ETFs purchased 111,000 BTC in the same period, with an 8% growth. According to Nick Marie, research director at Ecoinometrics, the motivation for companies to buy Bitcoin is quite different from ETF investors: “These companies accumulate BTC with the goal of increasing shareholder value. They are more focused on the amount of BTC in their vaults than the price level.” Marie noted that public companies increased their Bitcoin holdings by 4% in April, while this increase in ETFs remained at 2% during the same period. During this period, the market was volatile due to President Donald Trump’s first tariff announcements. Although ETFs are still the largest institutional Bitcoin investors with a total of 1.4 million BTC (6.8% of the maximum supply), the amount held by public companies has reached 855,000 BTC (4%). This trend also coincides with the regulatory easing seen in the cryptocurrency sector during the Trump administration. An executive order signed in March announced the creation of the official US Bitcoin reserve. The last time ETFs bought more BTC from public companies was in the third quarter of 2024, before Trump’s re-election. Some notable company moves in the second quarter also drew attention: GameStop adopted Bitcoin as a reserve asset with the approval of its board of directors and began purchasing it. Health technology company KindlyMD merged with Bitcoin investment company Nakamoto. Famous investor Anthony Pompliano’s company ProCap launched its own BTC purchasing program while entering the process of going public via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). Related News: BREAKING: Historic Change Claimed to Completely Clear the Way for Altcoin Spot ETFs on the SEC The pioneer of this trend and still the largest representative, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) is in the lead with 597,000 BTC. It is followed by Bitcoin mining company Mara Holdings with around 50,000 BTC. Ben Werkman, investment director at Swan Bitcoin, notes that Strategy’s scale will not be easy to catch up with: “They will continue to be an attractive destination for institutional capital due to their high liquidity.” By contrast, Werkman said smaller companies offer high-yield potential for individual investors and small-cap funds. These companies have the capacity to accumulate Bitcoin on a scale that individual investors cannot, thanks to their access to public capital markets. Nick Marie, on the other hand, thinks that this trend may not be long-lasting: “After 10 years, the number of companies that adhere to this strategy may have decreased. Because as the category expands, the impact of individual companies will be diluted. Also, BTC may have completely normalized by then.” Investor interest remains strong. These companies offer attractive leveraged investment vehicles for investors who already believe in Bitcoin, according to Werkman. “These companies offer not just Bitcoin, but Bitcoin-backed appreciation backed by operating income. That’s what makes them unique,” he says. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: In the Last Three Months, Companies Bought Way More Bitcoin Than ETFs – What Does This Mean?
