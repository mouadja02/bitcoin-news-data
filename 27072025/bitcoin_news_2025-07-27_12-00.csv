2025-07-27T09:35:44,"Bitcoin Takes a Backseat as Investors Rotate Capital to ETH and Altcoins: CryptoQuant","The crypto market is witnessing early signs of a brewing altcoin season. Ether (ETH) has been outperforming bitcoin (BTC), a sign that investors are beginning to rotate capital from the latter to the former. According to a weekly CryptoQuant report , a continuation of the current market trend could lead to a full-blown altseason, where bitcoin stalls and altcoins take off, raking in massive gains for investors. Investors Rotate capital to Altcoins For most of this bull cycle, ETH has underperformed against BTC. However, the situation has reversed. The relative price of ETH to BTC has surged from 0.018 to 0.031, reaching its highest level since January 24. The shift in ETH performance started after the ETH/BTC Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio fell into the extremely undervalued territory in April. This ratio has acted as resistance since early 2023. ETH has now recovered and outperformed BTC by 72%. CryptoQuant analysts suggest that the ratio could rise further if it surpasses its 365-day moving average, with ETH potentially outperforming BTC even more. With ETH receiving more capital now, the asset‚Äôs spot trading volume is exceeding that of bitcoin‚Äôs. For the first time in more than a year, the weekly spot trading volume for ETH surpassed that of bitcoin. ETH recorded $25.7 billion last week, while BTC saw $24.4 billion within the same period. Analysts revealed that this is the first time since June 2024 that ether‚Äôs weekly spot trading volume has exceeded bitcoin‚Äôs. This means the ETH/BTC trading ratio is above 1. Overall altcoin trading volume has increased to the highest level since March. This metric totaled $67 billion on July 17, a figure the market has not seen since March 2. The growth indicates a renewed interest in altcoins among investors. ETH Sees Less Selling Pressure Than BTC Furthermore, crypto investors are injecting more capital into U.S. spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) compared to their Bitcoin counterparts. Ethereum ETF allocations are growing faster than Bitcoin‚Äôs, as seen in the ETH/BTC ETF Holding Ratio climbing from 0.05 to 0.12. Meanwhile, the ETH/BTC exchange inflow ratio, which measures selling pressure for the two assets, declined in May to its lowest level since 2020. The drop signaled that ETH was facing much lower selling pressure than BTC. Although the ratio has increased since then, it is still far from extremely high levels, which is a bullish signal ‚Äì ETH could continue to outperform BTC.

2025-07-27T09:32:19,"Here‚Äôs the key level Bitcoin must hold to claim $130,000 as ‚Äòpeak euphoria‚Äô looms","Bitcoin ( BTC ) could still reach the $130,000 mark, with the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands highlighting a crucial range to watch for this milestone. According to on-chain analytics platform Glassnode , the metric suggests that as long as Bitcoin holds above the $110,000 support level, there is room for a renewed push toward an all-time high. Currently trading around $118,000, Bitcoin remains in a zone of growing optimism, but it has not yet reached the euphoric levels typically seen near market tops. Bitcoin MVRV pricing bands. Source: Glassnode The MVRV model, which compares Bitcoin‚Äôs current price to the average price at which coins were last moved, helps gauge whether the asset is overvalued or undervalued. Since early 2023, Bitcoin has steadily climbed, typically gaining momentum after clearing major technical levels. The asset is now approaching a historical zone that has often preceded previous peaks. To break above $130,000, Bitcoin must maintain its position above $110,000, now considered a key support level. Holding this level could pave the way for further upside, while a drop below it may delay a breakout. Bitcoin yet to hit euphoric levels At the same time, on-chain analyst Ali Martinez noted on July 26 that Bitcoin‚Äôs current rally still has room to run. He pointed out that while the asset has climbed to around $120,000, capital inflows into the broader crypto market remain relatively modest, suggesting investor sentiment hasn‚Äôt yet overheated.

Source: Glassnode Martinez, citing Glassnode data, highlighted that aggregate inflows stand at roughly $82 billion, well below the $135 billion seen in December 2024, when Bitcoin was trading near $96,000. This divergence implies that, despite rising prices, ‚Äòthere‚Äôs still room to grow before we reach peak euphoria‚Äô. Bitcoin price analysis As of press time, Bitcoin was consolidating at $118,318, up 0.8% on the day but down 0.13% over the past week. Bitcoin seven-day price chart.

For instance, Bitcoin is trading well above its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $110,580 and 200-day SMA of $90,392, both signs of a sustained uptrend. On the other hand, the 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) stands at 60.43, indicating bullish momentum without signaling overbought conditions. Featured image via Shutterstock.

2025-07-27T09:15:07,"Rich Dad Poor Dad Author Issues ‚ÄòPaper Bitcoin‚Äô Warning As BTC ETFs Shatter $152,000,000,000","Personal finance author Robert Kiyosaki is cautioning against having Bitcoin ( BTC ) exposure through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) rather than holding real coins. In a new post on the social media platform X, the Rich Dad Poor Dad author refers to Bitcoin ETF shares as ‚Äúpaper,‚Äù emphasizing that it‚Äôs still better to own the real asset directly rather than depend on institutions for exposure. ‚ÄúBEWARE of PAPER. I realize ETFs make investing easier for the average investor‚Ä¶.so I do recommend ETFs for the average investor. Yet I extend these words of caution. For the average investor, I recommend: Gold ETFs Silver ETFs Bitcoin ETFs Yet an ETF is like having a picture of a gun for personal defense. Sometimes it‚Äôs best to have real gold, silver, Bitcoin, and a gun. Know the differences when it is best to have real and when it‚Äôs best to have paper. If you know the differences and how to use them‚Ä¶. you‚Äôre better than average. Take care.‚Äù Kiyosaki‚Äôs warning comes amid an explosion in the market cap of all Bitcoin ETFs. The latest numbers from the crypto data aggregator Coinglass show that Bitcoin ETFs collectively hold a market cap of $152.73 billion. At the top of the list is BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) with a market cap of $86.11 billion, followed by Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) with market caps of $23.14 billion and $21.33 billion, respectively.
