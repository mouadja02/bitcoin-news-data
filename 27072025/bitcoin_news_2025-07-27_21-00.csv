2025-07-27T18:51:05,"Legendary Trader Says XRP Shakeout Was Unsuccessful. Here‚Äôs What This Means for Holders","In a recent post on X, renowned trader Crypto Lord declared, ‚ÄúXRP shakeout was unsuccessful. Holders remain unfazed. This is the plan.‚Äù His statement comes amid heightened market volatility and renewed speculation surrounding XRP‚Äôs trajectory and potential for the token‚Äôs ascent to $24. According to Crypto Lord, recent price dips aimed at triggering panic selling failed to shake the resolve of long-term holders. Instead, investor confidence remains intact, and that may set the stage for the next leg up. XRP Price Holds Firm Amid Market Volatility After a sharp rally to $3.64, XRP briefly pulled back to the $3.16‚Äì$3.20 range, where it currently trades. Despite the correction, the price remains above key support at $3.00, a level that has proven resilient amid broader market sell-offs. $XRP shakeout was unsuccessful. Holders remain unfazed. This is the plan: pic.twitter.com/9TzSpGJoAt ‚Äî Crypto Bitlord (@crypto_bitlord7) July 27, 2025 The token recently broke out of a six-year consolidation pattern, fueling hopes for a sustained bull run. Technical analysts point to the breakout as a signal of long-term strength, provided XRP can maintain momentum above $3.50 resistance. XRP‚Äôs recent pullback followed profit-taking after the breakout. However, analysts still see a clear path toward $5.25 to $6.19, especially if the next rally is backed by increased volume and institutional flows. Institutional Catalysts and Regulatory Winds Speculation around a potential XRP spot ETF continues to build, with rumors linking firms like BlackRock and Grayscale to ongoing discussions. Meanwhile, U.S. legislative developments, such as the passage of the GENIUS Act and regulatory reforms under President Trump, are fueling optimism. These moves could allow cryptocurrencies, including XRP, into 401(k) retirement plans, driving a new wave of institutional adoption. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Standard Chartered and other financial institutions have reiterated medium-term targets in the $5.50‚Äì$6.00 range, citing Ripple‚Äôs real-world use case in cross-border settlements and growing clarity around U.S. crypto policy. Failed Shakeout Validates Holder Conviction Crypto Lord‚Äôs assertion that the recent shakeout attempt failed highlights an important trend: XRP holders are no longer easily rattled by short-term volatility. Instead of panic selling, many chose to hold or accumulate during the dip, reinforcing XRP‚Äôs position above crucial support levels. This behavior stands in contrast to earlier market phases, where similar pressure resulted in steep declines. Long-term investors appear to be betting on regulatory clarity and broader adoption as drivers of sustainable price growth. The ability to withstand engineered price drops suggests that XRP‚Äôs investor base is maturing, further strengthening its foundation. What‚Äôs Next for XRP? If XRP can break decisively above $3.60 , analysts believe the token could test highs near $5.00 and potentially climb toward $6.00. However, if the price falls below $3.00, a deeper correction toward $2.60‚Äì$2.20 remains possible. The outcome will likely depend on Bitcoin‚Äôs performance, overall market sentiment, and the pace of institutional inflows. For now, Crypto Lord‚Äôs post affirms that the latest shakeout attempt has only strengthened XRP‚Äôs bullish narrative. The holders didn‚Äôt flinch, and that conviction may prove pivotal in the weeks ahead. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

2025-07-27T18:30:49,"XRP Bullish Cross Playing Out Again: $9 Or $24 Next?","XRP‚Äôs technical setup is playing out another major move, and this time the bullish momentum is being backed by the reappearance of one of its most powerful historical indicators. According to a new analysis posted by Egrag Crypto on the social media platform X, XRP‚Äôs 21 EMA and 55 SMA weekly crossover has been playing out quite nicely, with XRP recently hitting $3.65 on July 18 before cooling off. Now, this analysis projects that the pattern may still be in its early stages. Based on historical outcomes, XRP might be on track to reach as high as $9 or even $24. Related Reading: Wall Street‚Äôs Bold Bet: Bitcoin Could Hit $200K By December, Banking Giant Says Bull Crosses Cause Massive Rallies For XRP EGRAG‚Äôs chart, which displays XRP‚Äôs weekly price action with the 21 EMA and 55 SMA trendlines, shows that each time a bullish crossover occurred between the two trendlines, it marked the beginning of a strong price rally. The first instance of such a cross was in March 2017, and by the end of that cycle, XRP‚Äôs price had reached a peak that represented a 40,000% surge from its low. Then in August 2020, a similar crossover produced a 750% pump before topping out. The most recent bullish crossover occurred in October 2024 and has so far resulted in a 560% rise from XRP‚Äôs bottom in September 2024. However, there was a similar temporary pump in April 2023 that Egrag excluded from his model. Based on different assumptions about the previous price playout between the two cycles, the analyst outlined two possible targets for the current cycle. The first projection is a 1,500% rally, double that of 2020‚Äôs run, which would place the price peak for this cycle at $9. The second projection is a 4,000% rally, which represents just 10% of the massive 2017 spike. This second, more bullish projection places XRP‚Äôs price peak anywhere at $24. Chart Image From X: Egrag Crypto XRP Drops To Retest $3 After New ATH At $3.65 After reaching a new cycle high of $3.65 on July 18, XRP failed to hold above the $3.21 resistance zone and corrected down to test the $3.00 support level on July 24. The price volatility, although strong, wasn‚Äôt enough to break this support level. Crypto analyst CasiTrades also weighed in on the current technical setup by pointing to an Elliott Wave count that suggests a major third wave is about to begin. In her analysis posted on X, she confirmed that XRP has completed a subwave 2 correction, reaching the deep 0.854 Fibonacci retracement level before bouncing. What‚Äôs important here is that the price held above $3, never forming a new low, which is probably now a new price floor. Chart Image From X: CasiTrades Related Reading: Crypto‚Äôs Golden Rule Just Got Broken, According To Analyst If buying volume increases and XRP regains its hold above $3.21, the next move is to target $3.82, which coincides with the 2.618 Fibonacci extension. Interestingly, the analyst noted that $3.82 also aligns with what many platforms historically recorded as XRP‚Äôs new all-time high. Should XRP close a weekly candle above $3.82, it could lead to prices that align with Egrag‚Äôs projections. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $3.17.

2025-07-27T18:30:17,"Crypto Whales Are Dumping Ethereum For Cardano ‚Äî What‚Äôs Behind The Shift?","Besides storing digital assets, crypto wallets tell stories about the occurrences or trends in the cryptocurrency market. Even more interesting are the stories told by wallets of the bigger participants ‚Äî the whales. Tracking the transactions of these addresses can offer insight into market sentiment, as they often act as silent signals of future trends. For instance, whales of two of the largest cryptocurrencies ‚Äî Ethereum and Cardano ‚Äî seem to be telling some stories at the moment ‚Äî two different yet related tales. Diverging Paths ‚Äî ETH Whales Slowly Exit, While ADA Giants Enter In a recent post on X, the social media platform, Alphractal CEO & founder Joao Wedson shared on-chain insights into a growing divergence in the activities of Ethereum and Cardano‚Äôs whales. The relevant indicators here are the ETH and ADA Large Holder Share Top100 metrics, which track the percentage of Ethereum‚Äôs and Cardano‚Äôs total supplies held by the top largest wallets. This metric is particularly useful in figuring out if the major holders are accumulating or distributing their coins. In the post on X, Wedson pointed out that the top 100 holders of Ether tokens have been consistently reducing their holdings. The analyst explained that, since May, their share of the Ethereum supply has dropped from 22% to about 19.6%. This means that the holdings of the large investors have decreased by 2.9 million ETH in that period. On the other hand, Wedson highlighted that the top 100 holders of ADA have been ‚Äústeadily accumulating day by day.‚Äù He explained that this signals confidence in the token and could be a sign that strategic positionings are occurring in anticipation of future bullish rallies. What Could This Mean? The crypto pundit went on to point out that these large addresses are associated with exchanges, but it does not take away the fact that Cardano seems more attractive at the moment. ‚ÄúFrom this perspective, Cardano currently looks more attractive based on large player behavior,‚Äù Wedson said. In what seemed like salient advice, Wedson rehashed the importance of closely following the smart moves these crypto whales make, as they may reveal where the market is headed. At press time, Ethereum, the ‚Äúking of altcoins‚Äù, is valued at about $3,766, reflecting a 0.6% price increase in the past 24 hours. According to CoinGecko data, the price of ETH has had a slightly impressive performance of over 3% in the past week. Cardano, on the other hand, is worth $0.8297, reflecting a mere 0.6% price jump in the past 24 hours. ADA‚Äôs 7-day action was also barely impressive, ending the week with about a 1.5% loss of its value.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-whales-ethereum-for-cardano-do-they-know/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX|COMMODITY|ONDO|ENA|GALA","Ethereum|ADA|ADAUSDT|Cardano|ETH|ETHUSDT",cryptocompare
2025-07-27T18:22:07,"Trump‚Äôs EU Trade Deal Sparks Crypto Surge: BTC Nears $120K, BNB Breaks ATH","Just a few weeks after announcing new 30% tariffs against the European Union and Mexico, US President Donald Trump sat down with the former‚Äôs leader to discuss deal terms. The meeting between Ursula von der Leyen and Trump in Turnberry, Scotland, appeared to be productive, as both parties said they reached a framework for a trade deal. According to details shared by CNN, the EU has agreed to purchase $750 billion worth of energy from the US, as well as invest an additional $600 billion. The initial 30% tariffs on almost all goods, aside from steel and aluminum, which will be set at 50%, were announced two weeks ago and were supposed to be enforced starting on August 1. Although the EU will invest the aforementioned billions in different US-related initiatives, Trump said he could not lower the tariffs any further than a 15% across-the-board taxation. Tariff news typically impacts the cryptocurrency market, although the effects have diminished in recent months. Back in April, the entire market tumbled as Trump announced tariffs against essentially all other countries. Now, though, any new threats or announcements lead to less volatility. Still, a few digital assets began to chart gains after the news of the new deal was released. BNB is among the top performers in the past few hours, which resulted in a price pump to a new all-time high of over $825 minutes ago. BNB has reclaimed its spot as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency from SOL. BTC has also risen slightly and now trades above $119,000. ETH is up by over 3% on a daily scale and sits close to $3,850.
