2025-07-26T22:30:07,"Bitcoin Price Holds Above $115,000 — Here’s Why This Level Is Significant","After surging to a record high around $123,000 in the second week of July, the Bitcoin price action for the rest of the month has been largely choppy. However, the flagship cryptocurrency dropped to a level just above $115,000 on Friday, July 25. This abrupt decline came with the expected question in the market: Is the rally over? Here’s How $115,000 Could Be Critical To BTC’s Price In a recent post on the social media platform X, crypto pundit Burak Tamaç highlighted the relevance of the region below the $115,000 level for the price of BTC. This on-chain observation, which is based on the BTC Supply Distribution URPD, showed how the Bitcoin price could play out in the near future. Related Reading: Bitcoin Eyes Bounce off This Support Level In Reversal Campaign For $121,000 The Supply Distribution URPD metric tracks the amount of Bitcoin supply last moved or transferred at particular price levels. This metric is specifically useful in identifying potential support (demand) and resistance (supply) zones. Tamaç pointed out on X that there is a significant void in Bitcoin’s Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) distribution just around the $110,000 and $115,000 bracket. What this means is that there have been relatively fewer significant transactions around this price region in the recent past. However, this UTXO gap sits above a price region ($90,000 to $110,000) thick with significant investor activity. Considering the level of activity within this zone, there is an increased likelihood of the premier cryptocurrency finding a support cushion just within the UTXO gap. In this context, the support is to be above the $110,000 price level. As mentioned earlier, after Bitcoin reached a new all-time-high price, the premier cryptocurrency entered a consolidatory phase, where it has moved mostly sideways in the second half of July. During this period of indecisive price action, it can be observed that the Bitcoin price has not gone below the $115,000 price. What this means is that the $110,000 and $115,000 zone is likely where a new UTXO support has been established. If Bitcoin prevails above this price level, we can expect to see continued bullish momentum. On the flip side, if the $110,000 — 115,000 support zone fails, the flagship cryptocurrency might experience a severe sell-off. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at about $118,050, reflecting an almost 2% jump in the past 24 hours.

2025-07-26T22:00:30,"Galaxy Digital Breaks Record With $9 Billion Bitcoin Sale For Estate Planning","Bitcoin has experienced massive volatility following confirmation that Galaxy Digital executed the sale of 80,000 BTC on behalf of a long-term client. The firm’s July 25 press release revealed that the transaction, one of the largest notional Bitcoin sales in history, was successfully completed and immediately shook the market. The news quickly spread across the crypto space, triggering speculation and sharp price fluctuations. At its peak, Bitcoin recently touched the $123,000 mark, but the announcement spurred heavy selling and raised concerns that this might mark a local top. Short-term holders began realizing losses as the price pulled back, while analysts debated whether this historic exit signals distribution at the top or merely a healthy pause in a longer bull trend. As Galaxy’s role in the transfer becomes clearer, attention turns to the broader implications. Many market participants now wonder if more legacy holders are preparing to exit and what impact this may have on Bitcoin’s path forward. With volatility growing and investor sentiment shaken, all eyes are on how the market absorbs this $9 billion sell-off and whether support levels will hold in the coming days. A Historic Exit: Bitcoin Sale Triggers Market Speculation, Local Top Fear Galaxy Digital has confirmed the successful execution of one of the largest notional Bitcoin transactions in crypto history. The firm completed the sale of more than 80,000 BTC—valued at over $9 billion at current market prices—on behalf of a Satoshi-era investor. According to the company, this historic sale was part of the investor’s broader estate planning strategy, marking one of the earliest and most significant exits from the digital asset market to date. The announcement has sent ripples through the market, not only due to the sheer volume of Bitcoin involved but also due to speculation surrounding the identity of the investor. As details remain confidential, many analysts are debating whether the move signals a shift in market sentiment or simply reflects natural profit-taking after a prolonged bull trend. Some analysts argue that this sale is part of a healthy cycle, where early holders begin to realize gains after years of holding through multiple market cycles. They believe the market has the liquidity and institutional interest to absorb such a sale without long-term damage. However, others interpret the timing and size of the sale as a potential warning sign—a signal that Bitcoin may have reached a local top around the $123K mark. BTC Faces Critical Retest After Breakdown Below Support Bitcoin is trading at $117,407 after briefly dipping below the $115,724 support zone marked on the chart. This level has served as the lower boundary of the range that began forming in early July, with resistance at $122,077.61. The price reacted quickly after the breakdown, reclaiming the 50-day SMA on the 8-hour chart, suggesting the pullback may have been a liquidity sweep rather than a confirmed trend reversal. Volume spiked during the dip, indicating aggressive buying interest near support. However, Bitcoin remains below the 50-SMA ($117,593), which now acts as immediate resistance. The 100-SMA and 200-SMA remain comfortably below, confirming the longer-term bullish structure is intact, though momentum is weakening in the short term. If bulls can push BTC back above the $118,000 area and reclaim range highs, a retest of $122,000 is likely. On the flip side, failure to hold above $115,724 could trigger a drop toward the 100-SMA at $112,548, or even the 200-SMA at $109,436 if selling accelerates.

2025-07-26T22:00:00,"Crypto Still Seen as 'Risky' Among U.S. Investors Despite Ownership Surging 8x Since 2018: Survey","Cryptocurrency may be easier to buy than ever, but most Americans still want no part of it. A new Gallup survey found that just 14% of U.S. adults own crypto, a figure that has been growing but still represents a small slice of the investing public. The study, conducted in mid-June, revealed deep skepticism about cryptocurrencies. 60% of respondents said they have no interest in ever buying cryptocurrency, and just 17% admitted they’re intrigued. Only 4% of respondents said they plan on buying crypto in the near future. Gallup also found that among U.S. investors owning more than $10,000 in stocks, bonds or mutual funds, 55% considered the asset class “very risky.” Still, ownership rates skyrocketed from 2% in 2018 to 17%. This skepticism isn't surprising, despite the U.S. having a pro-crypto president and clearer regulations that have recently been rolling in. While the 2021 bull run ushered in extreme volatility and made crypto a mainstream topic, the subsequent brutal crypto winter, which saw many high-profile bankruptcies, such as FTX, as well as scams and exploits, soured retail investors' sentiment. Although crypto has since then seen institutional investors jumping into the market, helping it become more legitimate, many retail investors, burned by the past losses, are likely still staying vigilant. Four years ago, Gallup found that 6% of U.S. investors owned cryptocurrency. That figure has since risen but may be conservative, as a Fed survey revealed 12% ownership among U.S. investors. Diving deeper into the ownership, the demographic divide is stark. While one in four men aged 18 to 49 owns crypto, the survey found that ownership drops sharply among women and older adults. College graduates and high-income earners report above-average participation, but seniors and low-income households remain largely absent from the space, the survey shows. Knowledge gaps also persist. Nearly everyone surveyed had heard of crypto, but only 35% said they actually understood how it works. Familiarity was highest among younger men and the wealthier. Even among those who claim to understand crypto, most still call it a risky bet. Among U.S. investors, 64% see the asset class as “very risky,” up from 60% in 2021. The survey found that about one in seven Americans owns crypto, while nearly six in 10 own stocks or real estate. Only 4% of adults said crypto is the best long-term investment.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/07/26/crypto-still-seen-as-risky-among-u-s-investors-despite-ownership-surging-8x-since-2018-survey,"BUSINESS|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Finance|Gallup|Bitcoin|Survey|News",cryptocompare
