2025-07-27T13:54:08,"Crypto Weekly Roundup: BoFA Touts Stablecoins, Hulk Hogan and Ozzy Memecoins Hit The Market, & More","This week in crypto, there has been significant interest in stablecoins from institutional giants like the Bank of America and Western Union, while JP Morgan Chase started preparations to introduce crypto-backed loans. Let’s find out more. Business Bank of America (BofA) expects a significant rise in stablecoin supply and adoption as U.S. banks move toward issuance, driven by new regulatory clarity and growing demand for tokenized finance. Global remittance powerhouse Western Union is exploring the rollout of stablecoin services within its digital wallet infrastructure, signaling growing legacy interest in crypto following the passage of the GENIUS Act. JPMorgan Chase is preparing to introduce crypto-backed loans in 2025, allowing clients to use Bitcoin and Ethereum as collateral, a move that signals the bank’s cautious but strategic expansion into digital assets. Square, a unit of Block Inc., has launched direct Bitcoin payment support for its merchant network, marking a major milestone in real-world crypto adoption. Tesla’s Q2 profit surged to $1.2 billion, driven by a $284 million Bitcoin gain and growing AI ventures, offsetting weaker vehicle sales amid evolving digital asset accounting standards. FTX will begin its next round of creditor repayments on September 30, following a court-approved reduction in its claims reserve, potentially unlocking $1.9 billion for distribution. Web3 Memecoins linked to metal legend Ozzy Osbourne and wrestling icon Hulk Hogan soared following their deaths in a rally driven by nostalgia and speculative trading. This guide covers six easy ways to mine Bitcoin and altcoins, focusing on platforms that offer automated cloud mining, low entry costs, and no hardware requirements. Bitcoin.com Casino has now rolled out a 1 BTC weekly challenge , with the top performer so far hitting an all-time high of 10860 points. Security As Bitcoin rises in popularity and value, cybercriminals are finding new ways of stealing it, and one of the most common threats, phishing , tricks users into giving sensitive information such as wallet passwords, seed phrases, or private keys. Regulation Ghana will begin licensing crypto platforms by September 2025 as it shifts from caution to regulation to better manage economic data, financial stability, and surging digital asset use. The SEC has halted its own decision to approve the conversion of Bitwise’s 10 Crypto Index Fund into a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF), injecting fresh uncertainty into the regulatory landscape for digital asset products.

2025-07-27T13:30:40,"Three US Banks Sued Over Alleged Links to Massive Ponzi Scheme, Accused of Backing Criminal Mastermind Despite Red Flags: Report","Three US banks are facing a class action lawsuit over their alleged involvement in a Ponzi scheme. Community Financial Services Bank, Mechanics Bank and RABO AgriFinance are accused of knowingly or negligently enabling a Ponzi scheme orchestrated by Kentucky farmer and businessman Brian McClain, reports WPSD Local 6. McClain is accused of stealing millions of dollars from investors in Graves County by masterminding a fictitious cattle investment scheme. A lawyer for the plaintiffs, Mark Bryant, says McClain promised high guaranteed returns on a cattle business, with investors losing an enormous amount of money. “In reality, the complaint states, the promised cattle never existed, and the returns that were paid were paid using new investor funds in classic Ponzi fashion.” The lawsuit alleges that lax oversight and fraudulent transfers by the three banks helped sustain McClain’s Ponzi scheme for years. The three banks “allegedly turned a blind eye to hundreds of millions of dollars in irregular and suspicious transactions” initiated by McClain and his supposed cattle business. RABO AgriFinance reportedly gave McClain over $70 million in credit even though the lender had concerns over the businessman’s actual cattle ownership and poor keeping of records. Community Financial Services Bank reportedly allowed McClain to obtain more than 100 days of overdraft period and failed to act despite evidence of suspicious fund transfers. The bank was also aware of McClain’s financial position prior to the alleged Ponzi scheme but took no action even after the state of his finances changed drastically, according to the report. Mechanics Bank also allegedly allowed McClain overdrafts. McClain committed suicide in April of 2023 and the alleged Ponzi scheme was uncovered soon after his death. The class action lawsuit against the three banks is seeking compensatory and punitive damages.

2025-07-27T13:21:59,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Reclaims $118,000 Despite Recent Volatility","Bitcoin (BTC) has nudged past $118,000 during the ongoing session despite recent volatility that saw the price drop to an intraday low of $114,770 on Friday. However, it recovered over the weekend, steadily climbing as price action remained muted. The flagship cryptocurrency is marginally up during the ongoing session, trading around $118,115. OG Bitcoin Holders “Faith Shaken” A crypto analyst has sparked a debate in the Bitcoin and crypto communities, claiming Bitcoin OGs are losing faith in the asset as it sees increasing institutional adoption. Scott Melker, also known as the Wolf of All Street, stated in a post on X, “Many of the most ardent early whales have seen their faith shaken and have been selling at these prices. Bitcoin is amazing, but it’s obviously been co-opted to some degree by the very people that it was created as a hedge against.” Melker pointed out that he is only highlighting what he has been hearing. However, the comments triggered a wave of reactions from the Bitcoin community regarding the asset’s institutional adoption and its implications for its original ethos. Alpine Fox founder and managing partner Mike Alfred disagreed with Melker, stating, “People make a personal decision to sell some or all of their coins for a myriad of reasons that have nothing to do with the asset or protocol. Everyone dies. At some point, investment returns become irrelevant.” One early adopter revealed that he sold his Bitcoin because he believes investing in Bitcoin infrastructure would give better returns. Bitcoiner Dave Weisberger stated that widespread Bitcoin adoption is impossible without institutional interest. “The irony is that there is NO path to a Bitcoin standard without adoption by the public through the legacy institutions controlling the fiat system AND the distribution of OG held Bitcoin to those entities.” Bitcoin Could See Significant Upside In 2026 Bitcoin (BTC) could see substantial upside in 2026, potentially marking the end of its four-year market cycle, according to Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan. The prediction comes amid sharp disagreements among analysts about whether Bitcoin will change its historical pattern or follow the traditional halving cycle. Hougan stated, “I bet 2026 is an up year. I broadly think we’re in for a good few years.” Hougan added that Bitcoin’s four-year halving cycle is “dead” due to several reasons, including the Bitcoin halving becoming “half as important” every four years. President Donald Trump has also been pressuring the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, a bullish catalyst for the cryptocurrency. He also noted that the chances of a significant pullback have decreased due to increased regulatory clarity. “Blow-up risk is attenuated, due to improving regulation and the institutionalization of the space. The long-term pro-crypto forces will overwhelm the classic ""four-year cycle"" forces, to the extent those exist, and that 2026 will be a good year.” Hougan stated that the most significant “cyclical-style risk” for Bitcoin is the rise of Bitcoin treasury companies. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has traded in positive territory over the weekend, posting marginal gains as it briefly crossed $118,000. The flagship cryptocurrency has faced substantial selling pressure in recent sessions. BTC has struggled to reclaim $120,000 but has held above $115,000, indicating that buyers have not ceded ground. Analysts believe BTC’s bullish structure remains intact, but price action will likely be steady rather than aggressive jumps. “I think it’s more sustained, steady boom than super-cycle. I could be wrong, and I'm certain there will be significant volatility.” The forecast comes days after CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju said that he believes the Bitcoin four-year cycle is dead. Ju stated, “My predictions were based on it — buy when whales accumulate, sell when retail joins. But that pattern no longer holds. Last cycle, whales were sold to retail. This time, old whales sell to new long-term whales. Institutional adoption is bigger than we thought.” BTC registered a sharp drop on Friday after facing substantial volatility and selling pressure. As a result, it fell to a low of $116,805 before settling at $117,877, ultimately registering a 1.03% decrease. Sellers retained control over the weekend as BTC registered a marginal drop on Saturday before falling 0.48% on Sunday to settle at $117,240, but not before dropping to a low of $116,240. BTC started the week in positive territory, reaching an intraday high of $119,603. However, it could not stay at this level and settled at $117,402, registering a marginal increase. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as BTC rallied, rising over 2% to cross $119,000 and settle at $119,982. Source: TradingView Despite the positive sentiment, BTC lost momentum on Wednesday, dropping 0.99% to a low of $117,321, before settling at $118,794. Buyers retained control on Thursday as the price fell 0.35% to $118,381. Selling pressure intensified on Friday as BTC plunged to an intraday low of $114,779. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $117,000 and settle at $117,565, ultimately registering a decline of 0.69%. The price recovered on Saturday, rising 0.24%. The current session sees BTC marginally down as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-07-27T13:11:25,"Cyprus police launch investigation into €381,653 stolen from crypto wallet","Police in Cyprus are investigating the theft of digital assets from a crypto wallet after a report by a 48-year-old man. The official complaint, which was filed by the man on July 26, claimed that digital assets worth €381,653 were stolen from his wallet. The complaint filed at the cybercrime division of the Cyprus police noted that the incident happened on June 11. The man claimed that unknown criminals gained unauthorized entry into his wallet, stealing his digital assets in the process. The hackers exploited a key weakness, gaining the password to the breached wallet from his email account, which had also been hacked in the past. Once they gained access to the digital assets , they moved all of them to a different digital asset. Cyprus police kickstart investigations into crypto theft Cyprus police have mentioned that the investigation will be very hard, and recovering the digital assets might be extremely difficult. The police say this case highlights a growing concern that has rocked Cyprus and the global crypto community. There has been a rise in cyberattacks targeting personal digital assets. These criminals target victims under the guise of either offering help or selling a service. Analysts have also noted that while digital assets offer privacy and decentralization, they also carry risks without proper security. For instance, users are being advised to write down their passwords and seed phrases offline. This way, they are safe, even when their devices are hacked. In response to the incident, the Cyprus police have issued a public advisory to individuals dealing in digital assets, urging them to take steps to secure their digital properties. Authorities have also recommended the use of secure digital wallets with advanced safety measures to help combat this menace. In addition, traders and enthusiasts are urged to only carry out transactions on trusted platforms, drumming up the need for two-factor authentication as a requirement to carry out transactions on platforms. The public has also been warned not to open suspicious links or download untrustworthy applications. Some of these scammers create applications and websites to mirror the original platforms. The cybercrime division of the Cyprus police says it will continue to investigate the case and has urged anyone with information that can help them to come forward. Fraudsters increase activities as total scam losses hit $2.1 billion Meanwhile, scammers and fraudsters are now taking advantage of the recent crypto activities to increase their attacks. Losses to crypto scams hit a new record of $2.1 billion in the first half of 2025, eclipsing the previous record of $2 billion set in 2022, and almost equaling the entire losses witnessed in 2024. In a statement by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, scammers have now resorted to impersonating the official YouTube account of Ripple in an attempt to con users. This is not the first time that the issue has happened to Ripple, as the crypto firm sued YouTube over impersonators in April 2021. The company sought damages from the video-sharing platform, accusing it of profiting from the activities of these scammers. However, Ripple dropped the lawsuit in March 2021, claiming that it had come to a peaceful resolution with YouTube and that the pair had agreed to combat scams together. Ripple isn’t the only firm being targeted by impersonators, as the criminals have continued to work overtime to steal from unsuspecting users. A recent post by security firm Scam Sniffer mentioned that it had found direct Google searches related to crypto firms showed scam ads at the top of the results. “Pro tip for DeFi users: Stop using Google search for crypto sites unless you enjoy playing Russian roulette with your wallet!” Scam Sniffer said.

2025-07-27T13:05:32,"Ethereum Price Prediction: ETFs Log 17-Day Inflow Streak – Is a Supply Shock Coming?","Ethereum spot ETFs have achieved a historic 17-day consecutive inflow streak, recording $453 million on Friday alone and pushing total assets to $20.66 billion. BlackRock’s ETHA led with $440 million in daily inflows, making it the second-highest flowing US ETF this week. Source: SosoValue The sustained institutional demand has generated $9.33 billion in cumulative inflows, with weekly net inflows reaching $1.8 billion compared to just $71 million for Bitcoin ETFs. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan projects that ETH ETF demand could reach $20 billion within the next year, equivalent to approximately 5.33 million ETH at current prices. With Ethereum expected to issue only 0.8 million ETH during that timeframe, demand could outpace supply nearly sevenfold. Technical analysis indicates that Ethereum is approaching a diamond pattern resolution around $2,832. Seasonal data show that August historically delivers 64.2% returns during post-halving years, positioning ETH for potential acceleration toward $4,000-$6,000 targets. Diamond Pattern Resolution Targets $4,000 Breakout Ethereum’s 3-day chart reveals a massive diamond formation approaching resolution around $2,832, with the pattern reaching its apex where decisive breakouts typically occur. Source: LordOfAlts on X The diamond represents one of the most powerful reversal patterns, characterized by expanding volatility followed by contracting volatility. ETH has reached successive highs around $4,000 and lows around $1,400, creating the classic diamond shape. The ascending trendline provides crucial support through multiple tests, with the recent breakout above this support suggesting renewed bullish momentum. Diamond patterns developing over extended periods typically lead to proportionally larger moves when finally resolved toward the upper boundary. Analyst projections of over $ 4,000 resulted from measured moves following successful upward resolution, targeting previous cycle resistance levels where significant institutional positioning awaits confirmation. Ethereum Price Prediction: Seasonal Strength Points to $6,000 August Target The monthly returns heatmap provides crucial seasonal context, supporting bullish prospects for August. Source: Crypto Rover on X Historical data shows August typically delivers exceptional returns for Ethereum, averaging 64.2% during post-halving years. The pattern consistently reveals strong performance, with gains of 35.62% in 2021, 25.32% in 2020, and 92.86% in 2017. Current July performance shows 50.79% for 2025, suggesting momentum is building for the traditional August rally. If historical patterns hold true from current levels around $2,800, the 64.2% average August return would project the Ethereum price toward the $6,000 target range during its strongest seasonal month. Additionally, CME futures open interest, which has reached record levels of $7.85 billion, provides further institutional validation. Whales are loading $ETH like never before.

Best Wallet: Final Months to Join $14.2M Presale Before December Deadline Ethereum’s potential supply shock from sustained ETF inflows and a breakout toward $4,000-$6,000 targets creates a compelling opportunity for alternative tokens within the Ethereum ecosystem. Best Wallet’s $BEST token presale has raised over $14.2 million, with the December 31, 2025, deadline rapidly approaching. This closing deadline offers investors the final months to secure positions before the window closes permanently. Source: Best Wallet The $BEST token unlocks exclusive presale launchpad access, discounted trading fees, and staking rewards, which are essential for capitalizing on Ethereum’s potential acceleration phase. Best Wallet’s comprehensive platform provides secure multi-chain functionality with institutional-grade Fireblocks MPC integration alongside built-in DEX capabilities for optimal ETH positioning. The upcoming Best Card integration enables spending gains with up to 8% cashback during potential rally phases toward seasonal targets. With Ethereum potentially facing upside moves of 43-114% during August and sustained ETF demand creating supply constraints, the approaching December deadline creates a final opportunity window for investors seeking to capitalize on the next ETH rally. $BEST will capitalize greatly on this momentum, and interested investors are advised to check the presale website and secure their position now.
