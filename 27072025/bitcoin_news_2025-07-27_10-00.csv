2025-07-27T07:38:08,"Nasdaq-Listed Company Announces XRP Reserve ‚Äì But Doubts Remain","US-based healthcare company Welgistics Health has announced plans to use XRP not only as an investment vehicle but also as a payment instrument and profit-generating mechanism. Documents filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by the company indicate that XRP has been integrated into its business model. Ripple advocate and attorney Bill Morgan commented on the SEC document, saying, ‚ÄúThis S-1 filing lays out a strategy to integrate XRP not just as an asset but into the company's financial and operational structure.‚Äù According to Morgan, Welgistics Health aims to utilize the XRP Ledger infrastructure to process transactions with pharmacy customers and manufacturing and distribution partners in a cost-effective and real-time manner. This initiative is cited as an example of the real-world use of XRP in business-to-business payments.

The same document also outlines the company's plans to raise funds through the issuance of stock or bonds in the future and use these funds to purchase additional XRP. The company intends to use the acquired XRP as collateral to raise funds and profit from XRP-based transactions. Bill Morgan commented on this as ‚Äúan example of how XRP can go beyond being a mere investment vehicle and function as a means of payment and collateral.‚Äù However, these statements have sparked mixed reactions within the cryptocurrency community. While XRP supporters see the initiative as a positive use case, some experts have expressed skepticism about the company's financial structure. Former securities attorney Mark Fagel pointed out that Welgistics Health's actual assets are limited and that its recent financial reports include a ‚Äúcontinue operating‚Äù warning. There has also been criticism that XRP could be used as a marketing tool. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-27T07:32:06,"CRO Explodes to 6-Month High, BTC Price Reclaims $118K: Weekend Watch","Bitcoin‚Äôs gradual ascent after its Friday plunge to a two-week low continues as the asset has risen to just over $118,000 over the past 12 hours or so. Although most altcoins are somewhat sluggish on a slow Sunday, a few have tapped multi-month peaks, such as Cronos (CRO). BTC Taps $118K Bitcoin‚Äôs latest all-time high, which took place on July 14, was followed by an expected correction and consolidation period. Within days, the asset slumped to under $120,000 and spent most of the next week trading sideways between that upper boundary and $117,000. After a few rejections at $120,000, the bears took control and initiated a considerable leg down that pushed the cryptocurrency to a low of $114,500. This came as Galaxy Digital offloaded 80,000 BTC (valued at over $9 billion) for a third party. Once the sell-off was completed , bitcoin‚Äôs price started to recover and jumped past $117,000 yesterday and up to $118,400 today. This meant that the asset has recovered four grand since the Friday low. Its market capitalization has climbed to $2.350 trillion, while its dominance over the altcoins has stalled at 59.2%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView These Alts Are Pumping Most altcoins are with minor gains today as well. Ethereum jumped to $3,800 earlier today after a 1-2% increase. Ripple‚Äôs native token is at $3.2 after a similar daily jump. BNB, SOL, DOGE, TRX, and ADA have charted similar gains as well. SUI continues with its impressive run, having surged by another 6% and is well above $4.2. BCH and CRO have added over 5-6% in a day, which has helped the latter surge to a new six-month high of over $0.14. The top performer among the largest 100 altcoins is HBAR. It has risen by more than 10% and now trades over $0.29. The total crypto market cap has recovered another $30 billion and is up to $3.970 trillion on CG. The metric reached a multi-week low on Friday at under $3.870 trillion. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

2025-07-27T07:30:26,"Avalanche (AVAX) DeFi TVL Rises Nearly 40% Following Octane Upgrade","In a turbulent second quarter (Q2) for the cryptocurrency market, Avalanche (AVAX), a layer-1 blockchain platform frequently considered a competitor to Ethereum (ETH), reported a mixed bag of financial metrics. Avalanche Price Declines But User Engagement Soars A recent analysis from data firm Messari revealed that AVAX‚Äôs price fell 4.2% quarter-over-quarter, dropping from $18.77 to $17.99. This decline came alongside a 2.6% decrease in its circulating market cap, which fell from $7.8 billion to $7.6 billion. The impact of this price drop was also reflected in AVAX‚Äôs market ranking, which fell from 15th to 16th among all cryptocurrencies. However, not all metrics were negative. Transaction fees for AVAX surged by nearly 29% during the quarter, increasing from 58,300 to 75,170. In terms of revenue, transaction fees in USD also rose slightly, going from $1.50 million to $1.54 million, indicating a growing user base and increased activity on the platform. Related Reading: Is $1 Dogecoin ‚ÄöInevitable‚Äò? Analyst Cites Perfect Storm Of Factors A particularly bright spot for Avalanche in Q2 2025 was the significant growth in daily transactions across its C-Chain and other layer-1s. Average daily transactions skyrocketed by 169.91%, reaching 10.1 million compared to 3.7 million in the previous quarter. This was complemented by a dramatic increase in daily active addresses, which surged by 210.45% to 519,954, suggesting a robust uptick in user engagement. In line with this growth, Avalanche also reduced its average transaction fees by 42.7%, from $0.05 to $0.03. This reduction is largely attributed to the Octane upgrade, which introduced a dynamic fee mechanism on Avalanche‚Äôs C-Chain, allowing for real-time fee adjustments to enhance user experience and reduce costs. C-Chain Transactions And DeFi TVL Soar The C-Chain in particular saw impressive usage growth, with average daily transactions jumping 493.4% from 244,995 at the end of Q1 to 1.4 million by the end of Q2. Daily active addresses also experienced a healthy increase of 57% quarter-over-quarter, rising from 29,554 to 46,397. Notably, there was a spike to 419,619 daily active addresses on May 11. As seen in the chart above, Avalanche‚Äôs total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance (DeFi) rose 37.1%, climbing from $1.1 billion to $1.5 billion. However, the stablecoin market cap on Avalanche saw a significant decline of 23.8%, dropping from $1.9 billion to $1.5 billion. Related Reading: Crypto Founder Reveals What Will Drive Ethereum Price To $10,000 The rise in daily active addresses across Avalanche‚Äôs layer-1 platforms was particularly noteworthy. The average daily active addresses surged by 444.8% quarter-over-quarter, from 68,723 to 374,402. As of this writing, AVAX‚Äôs price has recovered from Q2 lows toward the $23 zone, rising 35% in the past thirty days due to the recent bullish sentiment that led Bitcoin (BTC), the market‚Äôs leading crypto, to reach a new all-time high above $123,000.

2025-07-27T07:04:37,"Researcher Proves American Express, Bank of America, and Santander Use XRP","Crypto researcher SMQKE issued a direct rebuttal to a claim made by investor Fred Krueger regarding the real-world adoption of XRP. Krueger, in a brief post, asserted that ‚ÄúNot one actual human being is using XRP. Not one.‚Äù In response, SMQKE dismissed this statement as factually incorrect, posting, ‚Äú‚ÄôNo one‚Äô uses XRP‚Ä¶ except for hundreds of financial institutions like American Express, Bank of America, and Santander. But don‚Äôt let facts get in the way of a good narrative.‚Äù SMQKE‚Äôs reply was accompanied by a screenshot of a cryptocurrency adoption chart showing documented institutional use of XRP, distinguishing his position with publicly available data. Reference to Documented Institutional Use The image shared by SMQKE originated from a comparative overview of top cryptocurrencies and their recent use cases. It highlights XRP‚Äôs role as a bridge currency for cross-border payments and settlement within Ripple‚Äôs infrastructure. The document states that hundreds of financial institutions, including American Express, Bank of America, and Santander, maintain partnerships with Ripple, leveraging XRP within their operations. It further notes that Ripple has collaborated with global sustainability leaders such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and has committed to achieving carbon net zero by 2030. This counters Krueger‚Äôs claim by presenting a factual account of large-scale adoption by corporate and financial institutions. While the use of XRP by individual retail investors or consumers may vary, SMQKE‚Äôs emphasis was on institutional adoption, which is clearly outlined in the source material he provided. ‚ÄúNo one‚Äù uses XRP‚Ä¶ except for hundreds of financial institutions like American Express, Bank of America, and Santander. But don‚Äôt let facts get in the way of a good narrative. https://t.co/R0Wz4m0UR4 pic.twitter.com/FFg6AYFV2B ‚Äî SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) July 26, 2025 Clarification of XRP‚Äôs Function in the Financial Ecosystem The referenced document explains that XRP functions as a bridge currency to facilitate real-time gross settlement, currency exchange, and remittance flows. It is not described as a retail-oriented digital currency like Bitcoin or Ethereum, but is positioned as infrastructure supporting global financial activity behind the scenes. This utility has made XRP attractive to banks and payment providers who require fast, low-cost, and scalable solutions for international transactions. The institutions named in the chart suggest that XRP‚Äôs relevance lies more in financial infrastructure than in individual consumer payment use. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Implications of the Response SMQKE‚Äôs reply to Krueger serves to reaffirm XRP‚Äôs credibility within enterprise blockchain adoption. By presenting verifiable data, he rejects the notion that XRP is unused or irrelevant. His response focuses on the mismatch between the narrative pushed by some investors and the factual evidence of adoption by major financial institutions. It also reflects a broader dynamic in the crypto sector where public perception often diverges from enterprise applications, particularly with utility-driven tokens like XRP that may not be as visible in consumer-facing environments but remain active in backend financial systems. Krueger‚Äôs generalization that ‚Äúnot one actual human being is using XRP‚Äù appears to ignore this distinction. SMQKE‚Äôs counterposition centers the institutional framework in which XRP operates, distinguishing it from cryptocurrencies that are primarily retail-focused. He states that XRP‚Äôs strength lies in serving cross-border liquidity needs across banking infrastructure, not necessarily in direct consumer transactions. By responding to Fred Krueger with documented examples of XRP adoption by major financial institutions, SMQKE reasserted the token‚Äôs practical application in enterprise settings. His remarks highlight the importance of distinguishing between consumer-facing crypto projects and those designed for financial infrastructure.

2025-07-27T07:04:18,"$7,800,000,000 Asset Manager Piles Into Three Assets, Outlines Several ‚ÄòMassive‚Äô Industry Disruptors","The CEO of a $7.8 billion asset manager says his firm is investing in three companies poised to drive transformative advancements in healthcare, financial data and AI. Aureus Asset Management chief executive Thad Davis tells Barron‚Äôs that his firm has piled into Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO), believing that the firm is in a position to become the ‚ÄúAmazon-type‚Äù supplier for healthcare firms. ‚ÄúIt provides all the materials, equipment and supplies a lab environment would need. If you ever watch the dollies that come in and out of a hospital or biotech building, they are loaded with Thermo Fisher equipment.‚Äù The next pick is Applied Materials (AMAT), which plays a critical role in the development of powerful chips amid the explosion of artificial intelligence (AI). While Nvidia currently leads in chip manufacturing, Davis says Applied Materials is essential across four critical stages of chip production, ensuring its equipment remains indispensable for leading-edge chip development, driving significant long-term demand regardless of which company ultimately dominates the market. Lastly, Davis says the firm is a believer in S&P Global (SPGI), noting that it holds a dominant position in the credit ratings market alongside Moody‚Äôs, forming a near duopoly. Overall, Davis also says that Aureus is keeping a close watch on three investment areas that have the potential to become ‚Äúmassive disruptors,‚Äù including AI, blockchain along with crypto and GLP-1 drugs ‚Äì medicines designed to treat diabetes and obesity. ‚ÄúEach taken separately has the capacity to profoundly disrupt various industries. But some taken together could have the same impact. GLP-1s and AI might be amazingly helpful in revolutionizing therapeutic developments, for example.‚Äù Aureus is a Boston-based wealth management firm serving high-net-worth individuals, families and institutions.

2025-07-27T07:00:34,"Satoshi-Era Whale Completes $9,300,000,000 Bitcoin Dump Through Galaxy Digital in One of the Biggest Whale Transactions Ever","A Bitcoin whale wallet with a 14-year history has just sold off its coins in one of the biggest BTC transactions in history. In a press release , the crypto financial services giant Galaxy Digital says that it facilitated the successful execution of ‚Äúone of the largest notional bitcoin transactions in the history of crypto‚Äù on behalf of one of the firm‚Äôs clients. Galaxy says the transaction involved Bitcoin worth about $9.3 billion at current prices. Says Galaxy, ‚ÄúGalaxy completed the sale of more than 80,000 bitcoin ‚Äì valued at over $9 billion based on current market prices ‚Äì for a Satoshi-era investor, representing one of the earliest and most significant exits from the digital asset market. The transaction was part of the investor‚Äôs broader estate planning strategy.‚Äù In a post on the social media platform X, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju says that the entity that sold its coins had a wallet that originated from MyBitcoin, one of the earliest Bitcoin exchange and wallet services. In 2011, MyBitcoin suddenly shut down and explained that it had been hacked. The exchange only reimbursed its customers for 49% of their losses, suggesting that the rest was lost to the hack. Says Ju, ‚ÄúThe recent transfer of 80,000 BTC, dormant for 14 years, came from wallets originally hosted by MyBitcoin. The wallets had been inactive since April 2011, before MyBitcoin collapsed in a hack that July. It likely belongs to the hacker or the anonymous founder known as Tom Williams. It seems Galaxy Digital bought the Bitcoin from them, but I‚Äôm not sure if they did any forensics.‚Äù At the time of the hack, BTC was trading for around $13 a coin, meaning that the whale saw roughly a 922,976% return on its investment if sold around the $120,000 mark.
