2025-07-27T10:24:07,"The First 32,000 Blocks of the Ripple (XRP) Network Are Missing: Ripple Manager Makes a Statement","Ripple's chief technology officer (CTO) David Schwartz made important statements regarding the block loss issue in the XRP Ledger, which has resurfaced in the XRP community. Schwartz stated that there was a software error during the initial development phase and approximately 32,000 blocks were lost because of it. The XRP Ledger, the blockchain network that underpins the XRP coin, does not contain data from the first 32,000 blocks. This has led to some claims that the block records may have been intentionally deleted. Regarding this loss, which sparked debate within the community, Schwartz maintained in a social media post that the block loss in question was not intentional.

Schwartz said, ‚ÄúExisting data wasn't deleted to prevent further loss. There was no way to recover the lost data.‚Äù He also responded to the question of why the blockchain wasn't reset at the time: ‚ÄúResetting the blockchain would have erased all data beyond block 32,000, rather than ensuring the integrity of the data.‚Äù Records on the XRP Ledger currently begin at block number 32,570, meaning that approximately 32,000 blocks from the first 10 days of the blockchain‚Äîa significant transaction history‚Äîhave been irretrievably lost. Schwartz stated that this technical issue was first raised in May, and that the data loss occurred due to a software error while testing several ledger streams during early development. Although a plan to reset the system was made after the error was identified, this step was never implemented. As a result, the Ripple team decided to continue the system in its current form to ensure the security of subsequent blocks, even at the cost of losing the first ones. *This is not investment advice.

In a post on the social media platform X, the billionaire says that JPMorgan retaliated to a tweet he made last week, saying that the financial services titan was seeking to bankrupt fintech and crypto firms by charging them fees to access their customers‚Äô account information. According to Winklevoss, JPMorgan reached out to say that the bank would be pausing its re-onboarding of Gemini, which was dropped as a JPMorgan customer during the Biden Administration‚Äôs crackdown on crypto. ‚ÄúMy tweet from last week struck a nerve. This week, JPMorgan told us that because of it, they were pausing their re-onboarding of Gemini as a customer after they off-boarded us during Operation ChokePoint 2.0. They want us to stay silent while they quietly try to take away your right to access YOUR banking data for free through third-party fintechs like Plaid. Sorry Jamie Dimon, we‚Äôre not going to stay silent. We will continue to call out this anti-competitive, rent-seeking behavior and immoral attempt to bankrupt fintech and crypto companies. We will never stop fighting for what is right!‚Äù Previously, Winklevoss accused JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon of sabotaging President Donald Trump‚Äôs attempts to push crypto by enacting these fees. ‚ÄúJPMorgan and the banksters are trying to kill fintech and crypto companies. They want to take away your right to access your banking data for FREE via-third party apps like Plaid and instead charge you and fintechs exorbitant fees to access YOUR DATA. This will bankrupt fintechs that help you link your bank accounts to crypto companies like Gemini, Coinbase, and Kraken so you can easily fund your account with fiat to buy Bitcoin and crypto‚Ä¶ Jamie Dimon and his cronies are trying to undercut President Trump‚Äôs mandate to make America the pro-innovation and the crypto capital of the world.

2025-07-27T10:00:46,"Crypto microloans make a comeback as Trump backs crypto","Crypto microloans are experiencing a dramatic resurgence, fueled by a broader revival in digital asset markets closely tied to US President Donald Trump‚Äôs pro-crypto stance. Three years after a devastating market crash triggered a wave of bankruptcies across the crypto lending sector , a new crop of startups is aggressively re-entering the space. They possess unsecured, tech-driven lending models ‚Äî and no collateral required. These ventures are riding a wave of investor optimism reignited by Trump‚Äôs pro-crypto agenda and the sharp rebound in the broader crypto market. At the forefront is Divine Research, a San Francisco-based firm that has issued more than 30,000 uncollateralized microloans since December. Working alongside OpenAI CEO Sam Altman‚Äôs eye-scanning crypto identity project , Worldcoin, Divine says it‚Äôs helping individuals excluded from traditional finance access short-term loans under $1,000, denominated in Circle‚Äôs USDC stablecoin. According to Diego Estevez, Divine‚Äôs founder, this is microfinance on steroids. He continued to say that they were lending to everyone from high-school teachers to fruit vendors ‚Äî anyone with internet access. Divine‚Äôs model hinges on Worldcoin‚Äôs biometric verification. Once a borrower scans their iris, the system ensures they can‚Äôt re-enter the platform under a new identity if they default. Despite default rates of 40% on first-time loans, Estevez claims high interest rates of 20‚Äì30% and partially reclaimable tokens balance the risk. He also said individual depositors fund the loans, incentivized by promises of consistent yields. Crypto credit startups embrace programmable trust and AI Divine isn‚Äôt alone. 3Jane, a crypto credit startup backed by Paradigm (an early FTX investor), recently raised $5.2 million in seed funding. It offers unsecured USDC credit lines via Ethereum smart contracts, though it requires ‚Äúverifiable proofs‚Äù of financial standing ‚Äî such as bank statements or crypto holdings ‚Äî rather than collateral. The firm sells defaulted loans to US debt collectors and is working on AI-powered agents that obey debt covenants automatically, potentially allowing lower interest rates. Meanwhile, Wildcat, another rising protocol, caters to market makers and crypto trading firms by offering customized, undercollateralized credit facilities. Over $170 million has already been lent through its Ethereum-based platform. Like competitors Clearpool and TrueFi, Wildcat allows borrowers to define terms like maturity and loan caps, while lenders self-organize in case of default. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing a shift toward programmable trust,‚Äù said Evgeny Gaevoy, Wildcat adviser and Wintermute CEO. ‚ÄúIn the absence of collateral, reputation and transparency become everything.‚Äù Wall Street, AI, and biometrics fuel high-stakes reboot of crypto lending The crypto lending revival comes as Bitcoin prices hit new highs and traditional finance warms to digital assets. Cantor Fitzgerald recently launched a $2 billion ‚ÄúBitcoin Financing Business‚Äù, and JPMorgan is reportedly exploring crypto-backed loans. Even Coinbase is experimenting with AI agents embedded with crypto wallets, developed in collaboration with Altman‚Äôs OpenAI, that could one day autonomously manage loans and repayments. Still, memories of the 2022 crypto lending crash ‚Äî marked by the collapses of Celsius and Genesis ‚Äî loom large. Celsius‚Äôs CEO, Alex Mashinsky, is serving 12 years for fraud, while Genesis agreed to a $2 billion settlement in a lawsuit over defrauding 230,000 investors. Despite those risks, startups like Divine are betting that biometrics, blockchain, and AI can reboot crypto credit models for a new era where loans aren‚Äôt backed by assets, but by identity, algorithmic enforcement, and yield-seeking investors.
