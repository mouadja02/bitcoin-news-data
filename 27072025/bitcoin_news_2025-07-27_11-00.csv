2025-07-27T08:52:07,"Market Prophet Tom Lee Explains Why He Chose Ethereum Over Bitcoin","Tom Lee, managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, shared his views on the differences between the new generation of individual investors and institutional investors on Amit Kukreja's podcast. The experienced strategist clearly stated that the real reason behind his preference for Ethereum was the growth in the stablecoin sector. Tom Lee, a long-time chief strategist at JPMorgan Chase, is known among US investors for his accurate predictions of market trends and frequent appearances on major media platforms like CNBC. However, he has also been the target of criticism for his consistently optimistic approach to the market. In the podcast, Lee also touched on the characteristics of the era in which today's individual investors find themselves, attributing the change in this period to two main factors: the visibility provided to startups by independent media channels that came with the rise of social media, especially Twitter, and the resurgence of investor optimism about stocks that occurs every 20 years in the US.

Lee, known for his strong support for cryptocurrencies, was recently appointed chairman of Bitmine and played an active role in the company's $250 million Ethereum treasury strategy. This move resonated heavily in the crypto market. While he praised Ethereum for its technical aspects, Lee explained the main reason: “I love Ethereum because it's a programmable smart contract blockchain. But honestly, the real reason I chose Ethereum is the explosion of stablecoins. Circle, for example, had one of the best IPOs of the last five years. It's driven some funds to perform incredibly well, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 100x EBITDA. And this is a stablecoin company. Stablecoins are like the ChatGPT of the crypto world. They've entered the mainstream. This is evidence of Wall Street's efforts to 'stake' tokens. The crypto community, conversely, is tokenizing stocks, like the tokenization of the US dollar.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-27T08:40:33,"Solo Bitcoin miner successfully mines a block, earns 3.125 BTC","A solo Bitcoin miner has successfully mined a block on Saturday, earning the coveted 3.125 BTC block reward worth $372,773. The miner was operating through the Solo CK pool, a solo mining service. According to details, he successfully mined block 907,283, which contained 4,038 transactions, paying block fees of about $3,436. Over the last few years, it has been hard for solo Bitcoin miners to compete with large-scale, corporate mining firms. This is largely due to the increase in network hashrate and difficulty, making the scene very competitive. However, despite this competition, some solo miners have been recorded some degree of success this year, mining solo blocks at intervals since the beginning of the year. Solo Bitcoin miners record success The victories recorded by solo miners are a reminder that even though improbable and nearly impossible, they can still be successful in the industry. There have been several cases this year where some of them have come out on top when it comes to mining, taking the full reward. For instance, the first successfully mined solo block this year happened in February, with the miner solving block number 883,181 and winning 3.125 BTC worth $300,000. According to Bitcoin block explorer Mempool.space, the block contained 3,071 transactions and a total reward of 3.15 BTC. In a post announcing the development, Bitcoin miner Marshall Long speculated that the miner might have used a Bitaxe, a mining device that can be used for solo mining or mining pools where miners combine computational power to increase their chances of solving a block. In March, another solo Bitcoin miner solved block number 887,212, winning about 3.15 BTC, which was worth around $263,000 at the time. What made this incident spectacular is that the miner used a 480 GH/s Bitaxe device to solve the block. This month, there have been two solo miners who have gone all the way. The first, which happened on July 4, saw the miner earn 3.173 BTC worth $330,000 after mining block number 899,826. The second, which happened on July 12, saw the miner win 3.154 BTC after solving number 904,989. Rise in network difficulty poses challenges to professional mining firms Over the last few months, there has been a rise in network difficulty and hashrate, coupled with a drop in block subsidy. These developments have posed challenges to established mining firms. Most of them have now diversified their large mining operations into AI data centers and high-performance computing to make up for the losses racked up in the mining business amid a rise in competition. Bitcoin network difficulty is currently about 126 trillion, which is close to its all-time high levels. Its network difficulty has also been trending up over the last few days, forcing miners to use greater computing and power resources to mine blocks. Presently, miners earn a 3.125 BTC reward worth around $373,000 from a single block at current prices. The competition in the industry puts them on edge, pushing them to find the cheapest energy resources. In June, several Bitcoin miners located in Texas were forced to reduce their energy consumption to avoid paying peak demand charges to the grid operator. This caused a drop in block production in the short term. Last month, MARA was one of the firms affected by the weather conditions, reporting lower power output numbers due to its slowed mining operations.

2025-07-27T08:30:37,"Bitcoin Endures One Of The Most Intense Bear Weeks Of This Bull Cycle – Details","Bitcoin experienced heightened volatility on Friday, briefly dipping to a local low of around $114,700 before stabilizing within a tight consolidation range. The price remains capped below the psychological $120,000 mark, with bulls and bears locked in a tug-of-war that has intensified speculation across the market. Despite the pullback, Bitcoin is holding key support, suggesting resilience in the current bullish structure. Related Reading: TRON Drops Q2 Report: Revenue, USDT Dominance Lead Multi-Quarter Highs According to CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler, this week stands out as one of the most aggressive selling periods of the current bull cycle. Adler notes that only 12 weeks—about 7.3% of the entire cycle—have shown equal or greater selling pressure. This context highlights just how intense the recent market activity has been, with significant profit-taking from investors but no full breakdown in price. The combination of strong selling and price stability has introduced a high level of uncertainty. Market participants are watching closely for confirmation of either a deeper correction or a renewed push to break the $120K barrier. As the week closes, Bitcoin’s ability to maintain its consolidation range could determine the pace and direction of the next major move in this cycle. Bitcoin Holds Strong Amid Heavy Selling Adler highlighted that this week ranks among the top 7% of the most extreme in terms of selling volume during the current Bitcoin bull cycle. Despite the intense selling pressure, Bitcoin has shown notable resilience, recovering to $117,000 by week’s end. This rebound is seen as a positive signal, reflecting bullish strength in the face of aggressive distribution. While Bitcoin remains in a tight consolidation range, its dominance is starting to weaken relative to Ethereum and other major altcoins. This shift has caught the attention of analysts who now view this week as a pivotal moment. A continued decrease in Bitcoin dominance paired with growing strength in altcoins could mark the beginning of the long-anticipated altseason—a period where capital rotates from Bitcoin into alternative cryptocurrencies, driving strong gains across the sector. Still, Bitcoin’s recent recovery and consolidation above key support suggest that its bullish momentum may not be over. If buyers continue to defend the current range, BTC could be gearing up for another leg higher, putting pressure on shorts and reigniting market confidence.

This area has proven to be a critical short-term demand zone, with bulls stepping in aggressively to defend it following a recent dip. The price is now pressing against the 100-period SMA ($117,822), attempting to reclaim this level as support. The structure of the chart shows BTC remains locked in a well-defined consolidation range between $115,724 and $122,077. This week’s retest of the lower boundary and subsequent bounce signals continued interest from buyers, despite strong selling pressure earlier in the week. Volume remains elevated, suggesting active market participation during the recent recovery.

2025-07-27T08:24:45,"$9 Billion Exit by Satoshi-Era BTC Whale Sparks Debate: Are Bitcoin OGs Losing Faith?","Bitcoin’s identity crisis came roaring back into focus this weekend after Galaxy Digital (GLXY) announced that it had facilitated a $9 billion sale of more than 80,000 bitcoin for a Satoshi-era investor. The firm said the sale — one of the largest notional BTC transactions ever—was part of the seller’s estate planning strategy. The transaction was immediately seen as symbolic. For some, it marked a practical rebalancing. For others, it was a worrying sign that even Bitcoin’s earliest believers are cashing out. Crypto analyst and commentator Scott Melker fanned the flames with a sharply worded post on X. “Bitcoin is amazing,” he wrote on July 26. “But it’s obviously been co-opted to some degree by the very people that it was created as a hedge against. Many of the most ardent early whales have seen their faith shaken and have been selling at these prices.” The comment kicked off a fierce debate that spanned crypto influencers, traders, and ideologues — many of whom disagreed sharply over what the whale’s exit meant, and whether Melker’s framing was accurate. Some Dismiss the Concern Critics of Melker’s interpretation argued that one transaction — egardless of size — doesn’t signify ideological abandonment. They noted the sale was explicitly tied to estate planning, not a loss of conviction. Others pointed out that wallet movements can be misleading, and selling doesn’t automatically mean an investor has given up on the asset long term. Some community members even called the remark speculative, pointing to OGs like Adam Back and others who continue to accumulate. Melker later clarified that he was “just pointing out what I’ve been hearing,” not declaring his own view. Others See a Pattern Supporters of Melker’s take saw the whale’s exit as emblematic of a broader shift. With Bitcoin increasingly absorbed into traditional finance — via ETFs, corporate treasuries, and custody solutions — some worry that the asset has drifted from its cypherpunk roots. To this group, Bitcoin’s transformation into a tradable, regulated, and largely off-chain instrument is a distortion of its founding vision. If early believers are losing interest, they argue, it may be a symptom of Bitcoin becoming less about individual sovereignty and more about financial engineering. Bitcoin’s Open-Access Design Defended Another group pushed back against the premise that institutional involvement amounts to ideological failure. In their view, Bitcoin’s value lies in its neutrality — its rules apply to everyone, whether it’s retail users or Wall Street funds. Censorship resistance, not exclusion, is the foundation. These commentators argued that the rise of ETFs and custodial adoption was inevitable, and even necessary, if Bitcoin is to achieve broad monetary relevance. From this perspective, whale exits are simply a part of maturing capital flows — not a sign of philosophical surrender. Questions About Security and Use The debate also triggered deeper concerns about Bitcoin’s function. If most BTC is held as a passive store of value and rarely transacted, how will the network continue to be secured post-halving? With mining rewards falling and on-chain usage declining, some worry that transaction fees alone may not sustain network integrity in the long run. A Telling Moment While Melker’s post didn’t move markets, it did spotlight a critical question: What does it mean when early believers sell? Is it a warning signal, or a natural redistribution? A loss of faith — or a sign of progress? Galaxy’s $9 billion transaction offered no definitive answers. But the reactions that followed revealed just how unsettled Bitcoin’s evolving role remains. Between the vision it was born from and the institutions now shaping it, the ideological rift is no longer theoretical — it’s playing out in real time.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/27/usd9-billion-exit-by-satoshi-era-btc-whale-sparks-debate-are-bitcoin-ogs-losing-faith,"BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|MINING","Markets|Bitcoin|btc|News",cryptocompare
