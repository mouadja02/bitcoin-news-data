2025-07-27T06:30:50,"Vietnam Unveils Blockchain Backbone For National Data Security","Vietnam has taken a big step toward locking down its government data with the launch of NDAChain, a new blockchain network that only approved participants can join. Built by the National Data Association and overseen by the Ministry of Public Security‚Äôs Data Innovation and Exploitation Center, the system will serve as the main verification layer for everything from hospital records to school transcripts and supply‚Äëchain logs. Centralized-Decentralized System Based on reports , NDAChain uses a hybrid model. It relies on a Proof‚Äëof‚ÄëAuthority consensus, which means only approved nodes can validate transactions. At the same time, it adds Zero‚ÄëKnowledge Proofs to keep sensitive data private while still confirming its authenticity. Officials say the network can process between 1,200 to 3,600 transactions per second, a figure aimed at supporting fast checks in e‚Äëgovernment, logistics and other areas. JUST IN: Vietnam launches national blockchain NDAChain to power digital IDs, smart contracts & government records with hybrid decentralization. pic.twitter.com/FiTZpkluqE ‚Äî Whale Insider (@WhaleInsider) July 25, 2025 Built-In Identity And Tracking Tools The new system includes two key features. NDA‚ÄØDID provides digital IDs that tie into Vietnam‚Äôs existing VNeID setup. Citizens will be able to verify identities online when they sign documents or access services. NDATrace offers end‚Äëto‚Äëend product tracking using GS1 and EBSI Trace standards. Items get unique identifiers, which can be scanned by QR codes or RFID chips. This should help businesses prove authenticity to overseas buyers and simplify recalls if problems arise. Protection And Privacy Layer According to Nguyen Huy, Head of Technology at the National Data Association, NDAChain acts as a ‚Äúprotective layer‚Äù for Vietnam‚Äôs digital infrastructure. It‚Äôs designed to scale as data volume grows. Digital records‚Äîlike medical files or student transcripts‚Äîcan be checked without exposing personal details, thanks to the added privacy tools. At the same time, the permissioned setup gives authorities more control over who joins the network. Phased Rollout And Future Plans Based on reports, full integration with the National Data Center is set for completion by December‚ÄØ31,‚ÄØ2025. After that, the focus will shift to local agencies and universities, with industry‚Äëspecific Layer‚ÄØ2 apps planned in 2026. Potential applications include identity wallets, counterfeit prevention systems and digital notaries. These add‚Äëon apps will run on top of NDAChain without changing the core network. Alignment With National Strategy Vietnam‚Äôs move ties directly into its National Blockchain Strategy and the new law on the Digital Technology Industry, which recognizes digital assets as of June‚ÄØ2025.

2025-07-27T06:27:15,"Crypto News Today: Bitcoin Eyes $132K After Holding Above $118K","The post Crypto News Today: Bitcoin Eyes $132K After Holding Above $118K appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin is holding steady above $118,000 despite the recent ups and downs in the market. As of now, Bitcoin is trading at $118,274 and showing signs of strength after brushing off selling pressure and minor pullbacks earlier this week. This comes at a time when investors have been watching closely to see whether the crypto king will break out or buckle under volatility. $132K Could Be Next, But Watch for Confirmation The next target could fall between $127,000 and $132,000. However, they warn that confirmation is key before getting too excited. The crypto market has a history of sudden reversals, so it‚Äôs important to wait for a strong breakout before calling the next leg up. Altcoins Warming Up for Their Turn Altcoins are already starting to show early signs of life. XRP is bouncing, Ethereum is holding steady in the overbought zone, and smaller altcoins are beginning to stir. The total market cap for altcoins, excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum, has shown a slight uptick, hinting that money could soon rotate into the broader crypto space. Bitcoin Dominance Slips, Altcoins Could Shine Bitcoin‚Äôs market dominance is sliding again, which usually benefits altcoins. USDT dominance is also dropping, a signal that traders are moving funds into more volatile assets in search of returns. This environment could set the stage for a broader crypto rally. 80,000 Bitcoin Sold, Market Absorbs the Shock In a big move, a whale wallet from the early Bitcoin days sold 80,000 BTC through Galaxy Digital, amounting to nearly $9 billion. Despite this, the market held up surprisingly well. This sale is a reminder that even the biggest players are taking profits. With global liquidity still rising and whale accumulation continuing, the road to the next rally may be closer than many expect.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-news-today-bitcoin-eyes-132k-after-holding-above-118k/,"BTC|ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|ETH","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis",cryptocompare
