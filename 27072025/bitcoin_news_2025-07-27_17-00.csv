2025-07-27T14:30:12,"Wells Fargo Warns Fed Rate Cut and Additional Catalysts Could Trigger Pullback for Group of Assets ‚Äì Here‚Äôs the Bank‚Äôs Outlook","Banking titan Wells Fargo is unveiling a scenario that could trigger a correction for artificial intelligence (AI)-focused stocks. In a new CNBC interview, Chris Harvey, the head of equity strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, says investors are skeptical about the sustainability of stock market rallies after equities rebounded in a massive way from the April lows. Rather than a pullback, Harvey expects the stock market to consolidate as he sees the Fed cutting rates in the coming months. ‚ÄúA lot of people are looking for a pullback. They are talking about things being overextended. They‚Äôre talking about uncertainty with the Fed, and earnings and lions, tigers and bears, oh no. I don‚Äôt know what the short term holds. I think we could see a consolidation. It‚Äôs really unclear for me, but the underlying fundamentals: still strong. We do think the Fed will certainly have to be dovish in the next couple of months, and what we also think is that rates are going to rally because the deficit, in all likelihood, while not going to be good, will probably be better than expected based on some of the tariff news that we‚Äôre getting.‚Äù Looking at the tech sector, Harvey warns that a string of good news could hurt the AI trade. He notes that a more favorable macroeconomic landscape could stimulate risk-taking behavior and encourage investors in AI stocks to seek higher gains in other sectors. ‚ÄúOne thing I think that could potentially hurt the AI trade is if you do get the Fed cutting, if growth is better than expected, if rates do come down, suddenly the contrarian trade starts to look better, and you could see rotation. And I think that‚Äôs the biggest fear for AI right now.‚Äù Popular AI names include Nvidia, AMD, Palantir, Microsoft, Meta and Google.

According to an analyst, two tokens are quietly preparing for a surge, and they might just be early gems in the next DeFi wave. Aerodrome (Base Chain): Undervalued and Generating Serious Fees The first project turning heads is Aerodrome, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol on Base, Ethereum‚Äôs layer-2 network. While it‚Äôs not the biggest in terms of total value locked (TVL), Aerodrome is leading the Base ecosystem in fees and revenue. TVL on Base has been rising rapidly, and stablecoin usage is trending upward. Among all Base protocols, Aerodrome dominates in revenue, far outpacing its peers like Morpho and Spark. The Aerodrome token has been trading in a sideways channel since March, and this could be a prime accumulation zone. If prices dip toward the bottom of the range, it may offer a strong buying opportunity, especially if Bitcoin holds firm BlackHole (Avalanche): The Breakout Newcomer Next up is BlackHole, a brand-new DeFi token on Avalanche that‚Äôs catching fire. With $200 million+ in TVL and skyrocketing fees, it‚Äôs already out-earning top Avalanche protocols. What makes BlackHole unique is its bridge infrastructure, enabling users to move tokens like PEPE between chains seamlessly. With growing rumors of Avalanche partnering with institutions, this infrastructure could become a critical piece of future adoption. In just weeks, BlackHole crossed $1 billion in cumulative trading volume, and its active user base is growing.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/top-two-low-cap-altcoins-to-buy-in-2025/,"ALTCOIN|TRADING|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC","News|Altcoins|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-07-27T14:05:41,"Analyst predicts Bitcoin price for Q4","A historical price comparison between Bitcoin ( BTC ) and gold suggests that the cryptocurrency could rally by 35% in the fourth quarter. Notably, analysis by Ted Pillows projects a major upward move for Bitcoin, suggesting the digital asset could mirror gold‚Äôs historical breakout pattern. If the analogy holds, BTC may trade above $160,000 by Q4, he said in an X post on July 26. The comparison draws on analysis of gold and Bitcoin‚Äôs market behavior, identifying phases of accumulation, distribution, and re-accumulation before each asset entered a strong rally. Gold and Bitcoin price analysis. Source: Ted Pillows Notably, gold‚Äôs rally, from under $2,000 to over $3,300, followed a prolonged re-accumulation phase. According to Pillows, Bitcoin appears to be nearing the end of a similar structure. The analyst suggested Bitcoin‚Äôs market cycle is currently transitioning from re-accumulation to a rally phase. This final leg could significantly push the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price higher, potentially exceeding $160,000 before year-end. It‚Äôs worth noting that in 2025, gold has delivered a standout performance as investors turned to the precious metal for its safe-haven appeal amid growing concerns over a potential economic downturn. There is indeed potential for Bitcoin to reach these levels, especially as some analysts argue that holding key technical indicators will be crucial to its success. For instance, as reported by Finbold, crypto trading expert Ali Martinez noted that as long as Bitcoin holds above the $110,000 spot level, there is room to reach a new all-time high at $130,000. Bitcoin price analysis As of press time, Bitcoin was valued at $118,216, posting modest gains of less than 0.1% in the past 24 hours. Over the last seven days, however, BTC is down 0.45%.

Source: Finbold Meanwhile, Bitcoin‚Äôs technical structure remains bullish, with the 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) at $110,580 and the 200-day SMA at $90,392, both pointing upward as the current price exceeds them. The 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) stands at 60.43, indicating that the market is approaching overbought conditions but has not yet reached them.

2025-07-27T14:00:25,"Sharon, He Did What?! Ripple CTO Admits Faking Ozzy AMA","According to reports, Ripple‚Äôs chief technology officer, David Schwartz , has come clean about staging what was billed as a live fan Q&A with Ozzy Osbourne and the members of Black Sabbath. He admitted on X that during his stint at a firm called WebMaster, technical glitches and a lack of interest in the full band forced him to improvise. Fans only wanted Ozzy. So Schwartz ‚Äúcheated,‚Äù feeding prewritten questions and edited answers through the company‚Äôs old ConferenceRoom software. Early Online Q&A Shows Schwartz said that moderators were supposed to relay fan queries by phone and then transcribe the band‚Äôs replies. But when no one asked about Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler or Bill Ward, he slipped in ‚Äúcanned‚Äù questions to each member in turn. I typed up Ozzy‚Äôs answer as closely as I could, probably getting it way off due to the poor connection quality. I censored the C-words. And then I cheated. I passed a canned question to each of the other band members in rotation. And I mixed what I could make out of what they‚Ä¶ ‚Äî David ‚ÄòJoelKatz‚Äô Schwartz (@JoelKatz) July 24, 2025 Only ‚Äútwo or three‚Äù genuine fan questions ever made it through. At one point, Schwartz mixed what he could hear with answers provided by the band‚Äôs manager. He later confessed feeling bad that the session wasn‚Äôt the real, unfiltered chat he had hoped to run. Censoring Ozzy‚Äôs Replies Poor audio meant much of Ozzy‚Äôs legendary profanity was barely audible. Schwartz typed out the ‚ÄúC‚Äëword‚Äù many times over, but then scrubbed it at the request of his bosses. He said the bad C‚Äëword was pretty close to the only word he could hear clearly, so he censored it to make the conversation fit a family‚Äëfriendly format. The episode left him disillusioned about how hard it was to pull off an authentic live event online. Fan Tribute And Crypto Surge Based on reports, the confession arrived just days after Osbourne died on July 22, 2025, at age 76. As fans shared memories, developers launched meme coins in his honor. One token, The Mad Man (OZZY), rocketed more than 16,000% to trade at $0.0039, briefly topping a $3.80 million market cap before investors began to worry about scams and sudden dumps. Ripple And SEC Settlement Meanwhile, Ripple has been making headlines of its own. Last month, CEO Brad Garlinghouse said the company would pull its cross‚Äëappeal against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC is also expected to drop its appeal. That move cements Ripple‚Äôs original $125 million civil penalty but brings both sides closer to ending a nearly five‚Äëyear fight over whether XRP sales counted as securities transactions.

2025-07-27T14:00:20,"Bitcoin‚Äôs Parabolic Glory Days May Be Over, Analyst Claims","Bitcoin has climbed 250% since BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT launch. But those massive green candles‚Äîspikes traders chase‚Äîcould become a thing of the past. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs New Clock: How Wall Street Killed The Old Cycle, According To Expert According to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, the era of sudden jolts up or down may be ending. He says that spot ETFs and big companies piling in will smooth out those drawdowns. Spot ETF Approval Era Balchunas pointed out that IBIT just passed $100 billion in assets under management. Based on his view, that landmark tells you everything. Bitcoin traded between $116,000 and $120,000 after Galaxy Digital sold 80,000 coins. No panic sell‚Äëoff followed. Before ETFs, a sale like that could send prices tumbling by double‚Äëdigit percentages. Now, deep corrections look less likely. This guy gets it. We‚Äôve been saying same thing. Since BlackRock filing Bitcoin is up like 250% with much less volatility and no vomit-inducing drawdowns. This has helped it attract even bigger fish and gives it fighting chance to be adopted as currency. Downside is prob no more‚Ä¶ https://t.co/0ECd5XevcO ‚Äî Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 26, 2025 In‚Äëand‚Äëout profit‚Äëhunters once drove Bitcoin up or down by 20% or more in a day. But steady inflows from regulated products lure in large investors. Balchunas argues that fewer wild swings will make crypto more useful for buying coffee or paying bills. He believes this shift will help Bitcoin behave more like a real currency and not just a roller‚Äëcoaster asset. Institutional Steady Hands Based on reports from Citigroup, every $1 billion of ETF inflows can lift Bitcoin by about 3.6%. Using that math, Citi sees Bitcoin hitting $199,000 before December 31. That forecast depends on steady money flowing in. Big funds make big bets. And those bets tend to stick around longer than retail traders chasing quick gains. Citigroup notes that BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT became the fastest ETF to reach $100 billion. That matters because it shows how hungry big players are for crypto. If those trends keep up, Bitcoin could push past its current trading band. It may even test new highs without the classic ‚ÄúGod candle‚Äù leaps that gave quick fortunes‚Äîand quick losses. Volatility Trade‚ÄëOffs Meanwhile, some analysts warn that early Bitcoin whales are taking profits and stepping aside. As institutions arrive, some old‚Äëschool traders will leave. That could shift volume to less regulated spots or exotic derivatives markets. In a calmer main market, risks may hide in side channels. Related Reading: Wall Street‚Äôs Bold Bet: Bitcoin Could Hit $200K By December, Banking Giant Says Lower volatility brings fewer heart‚Äëstopping moments. It also means less of the adrenaline rush that attracts day‚Äëtraders. For some, that trade‚Äëoff is worth it. For others, the loss of big swings could drive them away. Calmer Waters Ahead? Overall, Bitcoin seems to be entering a new phase. Based on Balchunas‚Äôs take, those ‚ÄúGod candles‚Äù won‚Äôt vanish overnight‚Äîbut they‚Äôll be rare. The push from spot ETFs and corporate treasuries aims to make price moves smoother.

2025-07-27T14:00:13,"Could BlockDAG Be the Next Big Crypto Coin? $353M Raised, $1 Outlook, and Millions Using the App","BlockDAG is moving up fast, supported by clear progress in technology and real use. Its structure mixes Proof-of-Work with parallel blocks that already process 10 blocks every second, built to scale with higher traffic. The ecosystem is also growing. More than 4,500 developers are working on hundreds of real-world applications, and over 2 million people are mining BDAG directly on their phones through the X1 mobile app. This progress has made BlockDAG ‚Äôs presale one of the largest seen in crypto recently. With over $353 million raised and the coin still available at a limited-time rate of $0.0016, many now see this as more than early access. With forecasts suggesting a possible $1 price, some are calling it the next big crypto coin. What Makes BlockDAG‚Äôs Tech Stand Out in the Market BlockDAG solves key problems that slow down older blockchains. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, which build one block at a time, BlockDAG forms multiple blocks together. This design gives the system speed and flexibility that older models lack. The tech uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) format with Proof-of-Work security, allowing more data to move through the network without losing stability. Right now, it processes 10 blocks per second, and updates could take that beyond 100. This supports faster transactions, better app performance, and helps the system manage higher demand. The numbers show clear support. A presale raising $353 million suggests the idea is gaining ground. Developers and early users are not just testing the system‚Äîthey‚Äôre building with it. Its low-energy mining model is another draw, especially for projects that care about efficiency and sustainability. With speed, traction, and support coming together, BlockDAG is in a strong position to be the next big crypto coin. How BlockDAG‚Äôs Ecosystem Is Already Gaining Real Use BlockDAG is not waiting around to build momentum. It already has more than 4,500 developers working on over 300 practical projects. These include tools for DeFi, AI platforms, and other apps people can use in daily life. This level of developer activity adds real purpose to BDAG. The coin isn‚Äôt just sitting unused. It‚Äôs being added to tools, tested, and applied, showing clear signs of actual demand. That kind of growth supports the idea that BDAG could be the next big crypto coin. User participation adds another layer. The X1 Miner App now has more than 2 million active users. Mining can be done by simply downloading the app and tapping a button. No extra equipment or extra costs. Anyone with a phone can take part. With the release of the X10 miner, users can now link it to the X1 app and raise their daily mining rate from 20 to 200 BDAG coins. This feature was shown during a live demo led by BlockDAG‚Äôs CEO and CMO. It allows users to mine from home with little setup. This easy access and growing activity have helped bring in more than 200,000 unique BDAG holders. Combined with the strong developer community, this adoption puts BlockDAG in a solid position for what comes next. Could BlockDAG Reach $1? Analysts Are Taking Notice BlockDAG‚Äôs presale has quickly become a major topic across the crypto space this year. Since the start of its first batch, BDAG has gone up by 2,660%, rising from $0.001 to $0.0276 in batch 29. Even with this sharp increase, a limited-time price of $0.0016 is still being offered. This rare pricing move is drawing major attention ahead of launch. So far, the project has raised over $353 million and sold more than 24.3 billion BDAG coins, moving closer to a $600 million goal. The momentum is now building toward BlockDAG‚Äôs GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. Its launch price has already been set at $0.05, meaning those who access it at $0.0016 could see a 3,025% return on day one. Some forecasts are even predicting higher targets, from $1 to as much as $10 in the future. With this kind of traction before going live, BDAG is showing traits that match what many call the next big crypto coin. Final Say BlockDAG is showing progress in all key areas: scale-ready tech, working utility, active builder support, and a presale setting new records. While many platforms try to grow after launch, BlockDAG is building momentum before it reaches public markets. This early activity, paired with its solid structure, suggests it is more than a short-lived trend. It could become a lasting part of the crypto landscape. With the August 11 GLOBAL LAUNCH release approaching and the $0.0016 pricing window closing soon, this phase may not last much longer. If current signals continue, BlockDAG could turn out to be the next big crypto coin that people talk about for years to come.

2025-07-27T13:59:44,"Canadian elementary school drags crypto miner to court over noise that 'never stops'","Canadian elementary school, Lake Superior Academy, has taken legal action against a cryptocurrency mining center, citing noise concerns. According to reports, the noise from the mining operation located at Mackinac Trail, seven miles south of Sault Ste. Marie is a high-pitched, metallic noise that sounds like a chorus of mechanical insects. According to the Canadian elementary school‚Äôs Superintendent Susie Schlehuber, the noise initially registered at 75 decibels, roughly the volume of a running vacuum cleaner, at the edge of the school‚Äôs property on the other side of the road earlier this year. She mentioned that at the school‚Äôs front door, it was about 65 decibels, the same as a washing machine. However, the annoying high-pitched metallic whine began in March. Canadian elementary school initiates legal action against crypto miner According to the lawsuit filed by the school, the noise was somewhat dampened by the addition of hay bales to the site, and aside from a court order to pause the operations for two weeks, the noise hasn‚Äôt stopped. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It never stops,‚Äù said Schlehuber . She added that she founded the school because of an environmental focus, meaning that students always spend time outside their classrooms. Schlehuber added that the noise was noticeable because of that practice. ‚ÄúBecause of that, we noticed the noise even more so than if we were just a school that stayed inside the classroom with the doors closed,‚Äù she said. The superintendent claims they had to stop conducting lessons on the front lawn, stop opening the windows, and halt plans to build two new classrooms. The crypto mining operation in question is a six self-contained bank of machines owned by a Boca Raton, Florida, company called Odessa Partners LLC. According to filings from the company‚Äôs attorneys, the company is made up of two other business entities, Wyoming Partners Irrevocably Statutory Trust, which is registered at an address in Cheyenne, and Valletta Corp, LLC, which is registered in Delaware. Both of these firms are linked to a Florida native named Michael Carbonara. Carbonara is the CEO of Ibanera, a company that provides a fintech enablement and cross-border payments network, according to its website. Carbonara also applied for the building permit for the mining operation. Carbonara and Odessa Partners are yet to respond to the lawsuit. The last time both entities made any form of communication was after Chippewa Country Circuit Judge James Lambros ordered the operation to stop temporarily last month. Odessa Partners submitted a legal finding claiming its losses per day were about $15,000, and it was already taking steps to reduce the noise, noting the placement of hay bales in front of the machines. The motion also noted that the school property is located alongside Interstate 75, arguing that ‚Äúthe noise Plaintiff claims to be emanating from Defendant‚Äôs property is purportedly less than that typically generated by the use and activity occurring on the other side of Plaintiff‚Äôs property.‚Äù However, Schlehuber countered the claim, saying, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a huge difference between a loud truck going by a few times a day and constant noise.‚Äù She also claimed she had been trying to work with Odessa Partners regarding the issue since March and hadn‚Äôt seen any progress towards a solution. ‚ÄúWe knew we had to do something else besides just talk to them,‚Äù she said. According to the CEO of OOM Technologies, which operates a computer hosting facility not too far from where Odessa Partners‚Äô operation is located, that location is suitable for miners due to the abundance of resources. Shaw also added that the cold is part of the reasons, noting that ‚Äúthe most efficient way to cool the stuff is through the natural airflow.‚Äù Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?
