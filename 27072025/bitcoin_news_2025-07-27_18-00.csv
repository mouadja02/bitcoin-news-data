2025-07-27T15:48:10,"BREAKING: Critical Moments in the US-China Trade War, According to Chinese Sources, Tariffs to Be Extended for Another 90 Days ‚Äì Here Are the Details","The United States and China are expected to decide to extend the current tariff rates they have imposed on each other for another 90 days during trade talks that will begin on Monday in Stockholm, Sweden. According to sources close to the talks on both sides, the extension would be a continuation of the existing agreement reached in May and set to expire on August 12. The two countries mutually suspended most of their heavy tariffs in May, buying time for talks. In the third round of talks, the parties are expected to clarify their positions on key points of contention, particularly US concerns about China's excess industrial capacity. However, sources say no concrete breakthroughs are expected from these talks. According to three sources close to the Chinese side, while the previous Geneva and London meetings were generally focused on ‚Äúreducing tensions,‚Äù Beijing will also want to bring up the 20% additional tariffs imposed on Chinese goods by US President Donald Trump in March due to the fentanyl crisis in the Stockholm talks. The Trump administration has argued that China has not done enough to stop the flow of fentanyl into the US. However, Washington has not offered clear criteria for what constitutes ‚Äúsufficient progress.‚Äù The Chinese delegation may seek further clarification on this matter. A source familiar with the matter said Beijing ‚Äúdoes not find the 20% tariff fair‚Äù but might accept a basic 10% tariff if the additional tariff were removed. Related News: Michael Saylor Gives the Signal Again, May Announce Bitcoin Purchase Tomorrow - Here's the Current Profit Amount and Average Purchase Price According to the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics, the average U.S. tariff on Chinese goods currently stands at 51.1%. While the Chinese side considers this excessive, they say they have already absorbed the 25% increase implemented during Trump's first term. The People's Daily, the Communist Party of China's media outlet, wrote in an editorial on Sunday that Beijing was ready to cooperate with Washington to achieve ‚Äúmeaningful progress‚Äù in the Stockholm talks. The article stated that ‚ÄúChina has always adopted a constructive stance and advocated resolving issues through equal dialogue,‚Äù and called for strengthening mutual trust and reducing misunderstandings. However, experts say no major outcomes should be expected from these talks. Niklas Swanstrom, director of the Stockholm-based Institute for Security and Development Policy, approached the talks cautiously, saying, ‚ÄúI don't expect a rupture, but I'd be happy if I'm wrong.‚Äù Frederic Cho, vice president of the Sweden-China Business Council, also indicated that a 90-day extension would be the likely outcome of the talks. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business last week that he would work on this extension with his Chinese counterparts in Stockholm. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC that issues such as ownership of the popular short-video app TikTok could also be indirectly discussed. If ByteDance doesn't transfer control of TikTok to an American company, the app risks being banned in the US. According to Philippe Le Corre, head of the Asia Program at French business school ESSEC, the Stockholm talks could be a preparatory phase before a final agreement is reached. He suggested that a potential final agreement could be reached during a meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea in October. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-27T15:33:00,"Bitwise CIO Bets on Bitcoin Rally in 2026, Defying 4-Year Cycle","Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan believes Bitcoin could break from its historical four-year cycle and post significant gains in 2026 ‚Äî a call that diverges from mainstream expectations of a cycle peak later this year. Key Takeaways: Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan predicts Bitcoin could see major gains in 2026, breaking from its historic four-year cycle. He cites reduced halving impact, improving regulation, and institutional adoption as drivers of long-term momentum. Hougan warns that Bitcoin treasury firms could pose risks if overleveraged during market downturns. ‚ÄúI bet 2026 is an up year,‚Äù Hougan said in a video shared on X , adding, ‚ÄúI broadly think we‚Äôre in for a good few years.‚Äù His remarks come as debate intensifies over whether the classic Bitcoin halving-driven model still holds. Hougan Says Bitcoin Halving Cycle Losing Its Influence According to Hougan, several factors are now overriding the influence of the halving cycle. He argued the impact of halvings weakens over time, as each one cuts rewards by a smaller absolute amount. He also pointed to the broader macro environment, where U.S. presidential frontrunner Donald Trump is pressuring the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, a move that could drive capital away from bonds and toward risk assets like Bitcoin. ‚ÄúBlow-up risk is attenuated, due to improving regulation and the institutionalization of the space,‚Äù Hougan said, noting that clearer rules and expanding institutional involvement have reduced the likelihood of market shocks. He added that ongoing adoption by traditional firms could extend Bitcoin‚Äôs bullish momentum well beyond historical timelines. However, Hougan also flagged risks. He pointed to the rise of Bitcoin treasury companies ‚Äî firms that buy BTC using debt or equity issuance ‚Äî as a potential vulnerability. DID I HEAR SUPER CYCLE??? The four-year cycle is dead and adoption killed it. @Matt_Hougan says we're going higher in 2026. Early profit takers will be left behind!!! Full break down with @JSeyff and @Matt_Hougan in comments pic.twitter.com/Ffn9penapN ‚Äî Kyle Chass√© / DD (@kyle_chasse) July 25, 2025 Asset manager VanEck has echoed similar concerns, warning that such companies could be overleveraged if the market turns. Despite those caveats, Hougan expects a more measured advance ahead. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs more ‚Äòsustained steady boom‚Äô than super-cycle,‚Äù he said, though he acknowledged the path forward will still include volatility. Bitcoin is currently trading around $118,169, having climbed over 10% in the past month, according to Nansen. Hougan‚Äôs view aligns with recent commentary from CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, who declared the four-year cycle ‚Äúdead,‚Äù citing a shift in whale behavior. ‚ÄúOld whales sell to new long-term whales. Institutional adoption is bigger than we thought,‚Äù Ju noted. Bitcoin Could Peak in October If 2020 Cycle Repeats, Says Analyst However, not everyone agrees. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital recently warned that if Bitcoin mirrors its 2020 cycle, the market could peak in October, 550 days after the April 2024 halving. That would keep Bitcoin firmly within its historic rhythm, suggesting the debate over its future trajectory is far from settled. Bitcoin‚Äôs strong performance and growing reputation as a store of value have led analyst Tom Lee to call it ‚ÄúDigital Gold,‚Äù with a bold long-term price forecast of $1 million. Speaking on CNBC, Lee emphasized Bitcoin‚Äôs role as an emerging asset class that could challenge gold‚Äôs dominance. He also pointed to recent regulatory progress, such as the approval of the GENIUS Act, as a positive sign for the crypto sector. Lee believes a $200K‚Äì$250K Bitcoin price is achievable, representing just a fraction of gold‚Äôs market value.

2025-07-27T15:30:41,"Fraudster Drains $3,700,000 From Investors After Posing As U.S. Department of Homeland Security Agent and Attorney","A Utah man will spend nine years behind bars and pay millions of dollars in restitution after defrauding investors to the tune of $3.7 million. In a press release, the Department of Justice says Santiago Garcia Gutierrez is guilty of wire fraud, impersonating a federal officer, aggravated identity theft and making a false statement after orchestrating two separate fraudulent investment schemes. Authorities say that between 2018 and 2020, Gutierrez siphoned more than $2.8 million from a victim by pretending that he was working as a confidential informant for the Department of Homeland Security. Gutierrez fraudulently claimed that he could use his position to get discounts on exotic cars, planes and vessels that were seized by the US government. He duped the victim into using him as a middleman for purchasing what turned out to be nonexistent luxury assets. To make the scheme look legitimate, he sent the victim text messages from different phone numbers and made it appear that messages were from a confidential government informant, federal agent and even his own attorney. Gutierrez also defrauded eight other victims between 2019 and 2024. He persuaded them to invest in federal oil wells he had an ownership interest in, with promises of large returns. The victims did not receive any profit as Gutierrez used the money for his personal benefit, causing investor losses of more than $900,000. Gutierrez did not pay the federal government royalties on the sale of the oil extracted from the wells, despite knowing that he had to do so. On top of prison time, Gutierrez was ordered to pay $3.7 million in restitution to the victims and to forfeit $2.85 million.

2025-07-27T15:30:13,"Bitcoin Bulls Gain Traction From Ideal Long Zone: 2 Scenarios For The Week Ahead","The Bitcoin market recorded a minor 0.67% price gain in the last 24 hours, amid a brief return to the $118,000 price territory. This modest price increase forms part of a rebound observed over the previous 48 hours, following a significant 4% price correction earlier last week. Looking ahead to the new week, renowned market analyst with X username KillaXBT has identified two potential price development scenarios for the premier cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Holds Above $115,000 ‚Äî Here‚Äôs Why This Level Is Significant Bitcoin Sees Bounce From Key Demand Zone, But What‚Äôs Next? In an X post on July 26, KillaXBT provides an in-depth technical analysis of the Bitcoin market to map out the asset‚Äôs potential price trajectory in this new week. The popular market expert duly notes that Bitcoin experienced a price bounce after dipping into a key demand zone around $115,000, which they also described as an ideal long entry region. As earlier stated, the crypto market leader has since climbed to $118,000 following this price rebound. However, KillaXBT notes there is an established CME Gap around $117,071, which is likely to serve as a price magnet in the short term. For context, CME gaps are price gaps on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Bitcoin futures chart that occur when Bitcoin‚Äôs price moves significantly on the spot market when CME markets are closed, typically over the weekend. In view of next week, KillaXBT explains scenario 1 in which the Bitcoin market opens on a bullish note. In this case, the analyst states investors should expect Bitcoin to eventually form a higher low, ideally through a sweep of liquidity around the $116,000 area. However, if Bitcoin bulls can effectively hold this price pocket, it would trigger fresh long setups with stop losses tucked below the prior week‚Äôs low. In scenario 2, KillaXBT paints a more aggressive situation in which Bitcoin performs a double sweep of last week‚Äôs wick low around $114,800, thereby effecting a ruthless liquidity grab before an upward reversal. However, the market expert favours the reality of scenario 1, following the earlier liquidity grab with the price dip to $115,000. Related Reading: XRP Produces Successful $3 Support Retest ‚Äì But What Next? The Invalidation Risk Regardless of which scenario, KillaXBT has highlighted certain developments that could neutralize the prospects of a bullish reversal. In particular, the analyst explains that failure for the price to hold above the recent wick lows following a retest would force Bitcoin prices to deeper imbalance zones between $112,000 ‚Äì $113,800. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $117,900, reflecting a 0.21% gain in the last seven days.
