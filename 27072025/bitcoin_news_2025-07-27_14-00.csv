2025-07-27T11:45:04,"High-Net-Worth Investors Are Still Cautious on These Stocks ‚Äì According to Fundstrat‚Äôs Tom Lee","Fundstrat co-founder and managing partner Tom Lee says that deep-pocketed investors are still skeptical of a certain stock group,¬†despite a rally in the markets. In a new interview on CNBC Television, Lee says that high-net-worth investors are still on the fence about speculative stocks, shares of firms that carry a high level of risk but also offer the potential for very high returns The performance of these stocks is often attributed to hope and hype rather than a proven business model. Says Lee, ‚ÄúThese are not the stocks that we recommend for our clients. You know, we stick with large-cap quality and portfolios. 35 of the best S&P [500] names‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs $7 trillion of cash on the sidelines, and retail investor sentiment, I think you have to really fracture it. I think the Robinhood community is bullish, but what I‚Äôd call the high-net-worth and the traditional equity investor is still pretty cautious. That‚Äôs the heart of our universe of clients.‚Äù Lee also says that the US stock market is still in good shape to witness more rallies, as investor sentiment appears to be muted despite surges to all-time high prices. ‚ÄúSo I would say speculative activity, those are such small examples that I would say it‚Äôs way too early for me to say there‚Äôs speculation‚Ä¶ High beta as an ETF (exchange-traded fund), if you look at that, it usually should lead in a bull market. So it‚Äôs not unusual‚Ä¶ But the thing to keep in mind is that in 2021‚Ä¶ people were speculative excess in these Mag 7 and these large-cap names.

Cathie Wood Weighs In","There has been a surge in unstaking of staked assets on the Ethereum network, reaching record levels in recent days. According to ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood, the 2% cryptocurrency transfer reward offered by Robinhood may be behind this sudden unstaking demand. Responding to questions within the community about the sudden surge in Ethereum unstaking demand, Wood stated, ‚ÄúRobinhood offers a 2% matching reward on cryptocurrency transfers. Therefore, venture capitalists and other investors are transferring their staked ETH, which has expired, to companies known as digital asset treasuries (DATs) to raise funds.‚Äù Wood added that these companies operate similarly to MicroStrategy (MSTR) and Bitmine (BMNR), with brokerage advisors offering their clients BTC and ETH investments through these types of shares. This massive unstaking drive by validators and long-term investors on the Ethereum network has surpassed the outflow wave caused by Celsius in January 2024. According to onchain data, approximately 693,000 ETH, or $2.6 billion worth of assets, are currently waiting to be withdrawn. This is the largest unstaking wave since the introduction of Ethereum's staking mechanism. Related News: Critical Levels in Bitcoin Have Been Set - What Levels Must Be Exceeded for an Explosive Uptrend? What Level Is Important to Prevent a Decline? Due to the high volume of withdrawal requests, the withdrawal queue has extended to 12 days. However, the amount of ETH waiting to be staked remains at only 296,000 ETH, indicating very low demand for re-staking. According to staking service provider Everstake, validators are unstaking not only for sales but also for strategies like restaking and yield optimization. ARK Invest CEO Wood said some of these unstaking transactions are linked to institutional investors reallocating their staked ETH to digital asset treasury firms like SharpLink Gaming and Bitmine Technologies. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-27T11:34:39,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Satoshi-Era Whale Exit Fuels Volatility ‚Äî What‚Äôs Next?","Bitcoin price faces intense volatility following a historic $9.7 billion exit by a Satoshi-era whale who held coins since 2011, with Galaxy Digital facilitating the massive liquidation across multiple exchanges. The whale transferred over 80,000 BTC in batches, triggering a sharp 4.21% weekly decline to $115,444 as Galaxy distributed over 17,123 BTC worth $1.98 billion to major exchanges , including Binance, Coinbase, and OKX. Notably, analysis suggests that the sales may be connected to a hacker who took control of a whale wallet and facilitated sales through Galaxy Digital. Despite fears of market disruption, analysts suggest the selling pressure may be absorbed without significant long-term impact. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju notes that ‚Äúold whales sell to new long-term whales,‚Äù indicating institutional adoption is reshaping traditional market dynamics. Technical analysis reveals that Bitcoin is recovering from classic bull trap psychology while forming a falling wedge pattern, targeting breakout levels of $125,000, with institutional buyers, including BlackRock and MicroStrategy, actively absorbing the distribution. $BTC just followed the emotional cycle to the letter. First the bull trap. Then the fear flush. Everyone bullish ‚Üí then panic ‚Üí then silence. This is how major moves start: max pain, max confusion. Most won‚Äôt be ready for what‚Äôs next. pic.twitter.com/oixsz2k7gz ‚Äî Merlijn The Trader (@MerlijnTrader) July 27, 2025 Falling Wedge Breakout Targets $125,000 New Highs Bitcoin‚Äôs 4-hour chart reveals a classic falling wedge formation, with the price currently testing the upper boundary at around $118,347. Source: Captain Faibik on X The falling wedge represents one of the most reliable bullish reversal patterns, with declining highs and lows converging toward resolution. The blue projection line extending toward $125,000 indicates measured move potential from a successful wedge breakout. Volume characteristics reveal a decline in participation as the pattern matures, followed by an increase in activity during breakout attempts. Current positioning near the upper wedge boundary suggests that Bitcoin is in the final stages of its pattern, with a breakout likely triggering significant momentum-based buying that will propel it toward new all-time highs above the previous $123,000 peak. The convergence creates natural coiling effects where volatility compresses before expanding dramatically upon resolution. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Whale Accumulation Divergence Signals Institutional Absorption Whale holdings analysis reveals fascinating divergence where large holder accumulation accelerates despite high-profile Satoshi-era distributions. Source: Coinvo on X The 1-year change in whale holdings shows sharp increases reaching levels not seen since previous major accumulation phases. While ancient whales distribute holdings, new institutional investors aggressively accumulate Bitcoin at current levels. This accumulation pattern suggests sophisticated investors view current prices as attractive entry points rather than distribution levels. Recent institutional activity includes BlackRock acquiring 1,204 additional BTC and MicroStrategy adding 4,225 coins, reinforcing absorption capacity for continued whale distributions. The divergent behavior where retail sentiment remains uncertain while whale accumulation continues typically indicates smart money positioning for the next major advance. Notably, the continuous decline in Bitcoin dominance, from 65.95% to 61.25%, indicates healthy capital rotation, suggesting that Bitcoin can continue to advance while the total cryptocurrency market expands, driving broader sector strength. $BTC Dominance pic.twitter.com/lBNC6asPSv ‚Äî Christiaan (@ChristiaanDefi) July 26, 2025 BTC Hyper: Final Opportunity for $HYPER Presale Before Q3 Launch The exit of the Satoshi-era whales and institutional absorption highlight Bitcoin‚Äôs evolution toward mainstream adoption.

Source: Bitcoin Hyper Early investors are securing final positions in the Layer-2 solution built on the Solana Virtual Machine that addresses Bitcoin‚Äôs scaling limitations. $HYPER token holders unlock high APY staking rewards while gaining access to DeFi, NFT, and gaming applications previously unavailable to Bitcoin holders.

Despite a 29.61% drop in 24-hour volume, overall sentiment leans bullish with the Fear & Greed Index at a greed-driven score of 64. The Altcoin Season Index sits at 42/100, showing a tilt toward Bitcoin dominance. The gain in market has been supported by institutional inflows, ongoing FTX creditor repayments, and bullish DeFi developments. Investors are eyeing two major events next week that could reshape sentiment: the FOMC meeting (July 29‚Äì30), expected to address rate policies and macroeconomics, and the SEC decision on the Bitwise BITW ETF on July 31. Join me as I dive into the charts for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP price prediction for next week. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction Bitcoin is trading sideways just above its 20-day SMA at $117,176, reflecting a period of consolidation. The Bollinger Bands are narrowing, suggesting a potential breakout soon. RSI sits at 60.62, showing neither extreme overbought nor oversold conditions. On the upside, BTC faces a tough resistance at $123,680 , a level it failed to breach earlier this month. If bulls can push above this, the next leg could test $127,000. Conversely, a break below the support at $111,964 could expose BTC to $108,000. Next Week Target Range: $115,000 ‚Äì $123,680 Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction Ethereum remains one of the strongest performers. It continues to trade in an uptrend channel with solid support at $3,550. The RSI is elevated at 79.69, hinting at slight overbought conditions but still backed by strong momentum. Price is hovering just below the $4,096 resistance zone. If ETH breaks above $4,100, we could see a run to $4,250 . However, if rejection occurs again, a pullback to $3,600‚Äì$3,550 seems likely. Next Week Target Range: $3,600 ‚Äì $4,250 XRP Price Prediction XRP recently saw a bounce from the $2.8497 support zone after a correction from its $3.49 resistance. The RSI is cooling down from an overbought 76.12 to 62.02, suggesting room for a fresh move upward. Bollinger Bands show XRP attempting to consolidate above the 20-SMA at $3.0589. If bulls manage to reclaim $3.49, XRP could retest $3.60 next week. However, failure to maintain above $3.05 may drive it back toward $2.85. Next Week Target Range: $2.85 ‚Äì $3.49 FAQs Can Bitcoin hit a new ATH next week? Bitcoin is consolidating near resistance. A decisive breakout above $123,680 could open the door to $127k, but momentum must pick up. Will the ETH price hit $4,000 soon? Yes, ETH is approaching the $4,100 resistance. If buying pressure sustains, $4,250 is achievable next week. Is XRP still bullish despite the recent drop? Yes, XRP is showing signs of recovery from $2.85, and a move above $3.49 could confirm bullish continuation.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-ethereum-xrp-price-prediction-for-next-week-28th-july-2nd-aug-2025/,"TRADING|BTC|ETH|XRP|MARKET","Price Analysis",cryptocompare

Key Takeaways: Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen moved 50M XRP to exchanges, sparking fears of a broader sell-off. Larsen still holds 2.58B XRP, leading analysts to warn that more sell pressure could follow. XRP dropped 13% amid market volatility, adding to investor concerns about insider activity. The transaction came just days after XRP surged to near all-time highs above $3.60 on July 17. However, the rally was quickly overshadowed by Larsen‚Äôs wallet activity, prompting mixed reactions online. Some interpreted the move as a logical profit-taking step, while others saw it as a warning sign. CryptoQuant Analyst Warns XRP Holders: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Get Dumped On‚Äù J.A. Maartunn, an analyst at on-chain data platform CryptoQuant, cautioned followers on X, warning XRP holders not to ‚Äúget dumped on.‚Äù He pointed to Larsen‚Äôs massive remaining XRP balance as a looming risk. According to Maartunn, the Ripple co-founder still holds approximately 2.58 billion XRP ‚Äî currently valued at $8.83 billion ‚Äî making the 50 million token outflow a mere fraction of his total holdings. ‚ÄúIf $200 million was just the warm-up‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs next?‚Äù Maartunn asked, urging traders to ‚Äúprotect yourself‚Äù and avoid becoming exit liquidity. XRP has since corrected 13%, now trading at $3.18, according to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView. The drop came amid wider market jitters as Bitcoin briefly plunged to $114,500 after a dormant Satoshi-era wallet moved 80,000 BTC for the first time in 14 years. The transaction, processed by Galaxy Digital, triggered over $500 million in crypto liquidations within 24 hours, per CoinGlass. Chris Larsen (Ripple co-founder) still holds 2.58B $XRP ‚Äî that‚Äôs $8.83B. If $200M was just the warm-up‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs next? Don‚Äôt get dumped on. Don‚Äôt be the exit liquidity.

With billions of tokens still under Larsen‚Äôs control, market participants are watching closely for signs of further distribution, and the potential impact on XRP price momentum. XRP Perpetual Futures Open Interest Hits Record $8.8B XRP saw a spike in notional open interest for its perpetual futures contracts last week. Notional open interest, the total value of leveraged positions held by traders, climbed to an all-time high of $8.8 billion , according to CoinGlass. The figure corresponds to nearly 2.9 billion XRP in open contracts. The previous record for XRP notional open interest stood at $8.3 billion, which was hit in late January before the start of former U.S. President Donald Trump‚Äôs second term. Across most venues, XRP‚Äôs funding rate was positive and climbing, signaling a market where longs are willing to pay shorts to maintain positions, a classic indicator of bullish sentiment. As reported, the number of wallets holding at least 1 million XRP tokens has also surged to an all-time high . Data shows that wallets holding 1 million or more XRP collectively control over 47.32 billion tokens. Last month, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse revealed the company plans to withdraw its cross-appeal against the SEC, adding that the regulator is also expected to drop its own appeal.

2025-07-27T11:00:49,"Bitcoin‚Äôs New Clock: How Wall Street Killed The Old Cycle, According To Expert","According to Matt‚ÄØHougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise, what used to be a near‚Äëperfect four‚Äëyear Bitcoin pattern now looks less reliable. Supply cuts, rate moves and crash risks once drove big swings. Now, fresh forces are taking over. Related Reading: Wall Street‚Äôs Bold Bet: Bitcoin Could Hit $200K By December, Banking Giant Says Halving‚Äôs Impact Shrinks Every Cycle Hougan points out that each Bitcoin halving still cuts new coins by 50% but matters less over time. In early cycles, that shock fueled parabolic runs. Today, with a market cap in the hundreds of billions, the same supply cut is half as important every four years. Back in 2016 and 2020, prices jumped more than 150% around halving events. Now, moves hover under 50% in similar windows. Based on analysis from the Bitwise CIO, interest rates have been friendlier this time around. In 2018 and 2022, tightening by the US Federal Reserve coincided with brutal crypto drops that sent Bitcoin down 72% and 69% from peak to trough. Now, rates are easing or on pause, so crypto often trades up rather than down. Why is the four-year cycle dead? 1) The forces that have created prior four-year cycles are weaker: i) The halving is half as important every four years; ii) The interest rate cycle is positive for crypto, not negative (as it was in 2018 and 2022); iii) Blow-up risk is‚Ä¶ https://t.co/F9ybjHEeB5 ‚Äî Matt Hougan (@Matt_Hougan) July 25, 2025 Institutional Trends Outrun Old Rhythms Hougan highlights that ETFs are the new growth engine‚Äîand they run on a 5‚Äì10 year timeline. Spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in January‚ÄØ2024 and have since taken in over $10 billion in net inflows. That steady stream can‚Äôt be pinned to a single four‚Äëyear blip. Pensions and endowments are getting ready too. Many big investors only started talking crypto last year, and it takes quarters or years for them to clear internal hurdles. When they finally jump in, their billions could reshape markets far beyond retail waves. üö®DID I HEAR SUPER CYCLE???

Those steps cut systemic risk and pave the way for banks and asset managers to roll out crypto services on their platforms. Based on his analysis, the recent Genius Act‚Äîpassed this month‚Äîopened doors on prime‚Äëbroker platforms.
