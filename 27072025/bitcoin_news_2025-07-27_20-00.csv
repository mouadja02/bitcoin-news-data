2025-07-27T17:34:24,"Silicon Valley Startup Says It Can Turn Mercury Into Gold on ‚ÄòMassive Scale‚Äô","A Silicon Valley startup says it has discovered the pinnacle of alchemy ‚Äì converting a relatively common metal into gold. Marathon Fusion is proposing a process that uses nuclear fusion to turn mercury into gold, reports the Economic Times. In a scientific paper, the firms says it‚Äôs possible to use high-energy neutrons from a fusion reactor to bombard mercury-198, turning it into mercury-197, which then decays into stable gold-197 over a matter of days. The company says the process is extremely promising, but remains theoretical and is not yet implemented at scale. ‚ÄúOur approach is economically irresistible, practically feasible, and massively scalable, in contrast to prior attempts. An entirely new golden age begins now.‚Äù The paper, which has not yet been peer reviewed, claims the gold can be created as a byproduct at nuclear power stations ‚Äúwithout any compromise to fuel self-sufficiency or power output.‚Äù The method promises to create 5,000 kilograms of gold annually using a one-gigawatt fusion power plant. Marathon Fusion was co-founded by a former SpaceX engineer and a Breakthrough Energy Fellow. It has¬†raised over $10.9 million in funding, including a $5.9 million seed round in July 2024 led by 1517 Fund and Anglo American, with additional support from the U.S. Department of Energy‚Äôs ARPA-E, Breakthrough Energy Fellows, √úbermorgen Ventures and the Shared Future Fund.

2025-07-27T17:30:01,"Market Expert Says 33,233% XRP Price Rally Is Possible, Predicts Timeline","Crypto strategist Armando Pantoja has sparked renewed excitement among XRP holders with a bold long-term forecast: a potential 33,233% price increase for XRP. In a recent post on X, Pantoja suggested that while XRP may not hit $1,000 anytime soon , not this year or next, it could eventually reach that level, provided investors are patient enough to wait a decade or more. XRP in a Bear Trap: A Time to Accumulate? Pantoja describes the current market phase as a ‚Äúhuge bear trap,‚Äù where panic selling has shaken out weak hands. He believes XRP is severely undervalued due to lingering uncertainty from the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit, which he argues has reset the token‚Äôs growth trajectory. The legal setback, he says, brought XRP ‚Äúback to square one,‚Äù echoing how Bitcoin took eight years to stabilize above the $1,000 mark. Pantoja remains undeterred: ‚ÄúA 33,233% return? I‚Äôll wait 10+ years for that.‚Äù $XRP to $1,000? Not tomorrow. Not this year, not next year‚Ä¶..But eventually. Yes. Right now, we‚Äôre inside a huge XRP bear trap. Many panicked and sold. ‚Å∞ #XRP ‚Äôs lawsuit pushed us back to square one. Remember, $BTC took 8 years just to stay above $1,000. A 33,233% return?‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/6qE7fYf8jV ‚Äî Armando Pantoja (@_TallGuyTycoon) July 26, 2025 Legal Hurdles and Regulatory Reset The SEC‚Äôs ongoing legal battle with Ripple has been a major headwind. Although Ripple scored a partial win in 2023, securing clarity that XRP isn‚Äôt a security when sold on exchanges, it still faces penalties related to institutional sales. A recent attempt by both Ripple and the SEC to reduce a $125 million penalty and remove a permanent injunction was rejected by Judge Analisa Torres in June 2025. Ripple has shown willingness to withdraw its counter-appeal, and while the SEC has not yet formally dropped its appeal, both parties appear poised to move forward without additional litigation. The court has ordered a joint status report by August 15, 2025, which could mark a turning point in the case and in XRP‚Äôs regulatory clarity. Institutional Moves and a Banking License in Play Backing his long-term thesis, Pantoja recently disclosed a significant XRP accumulation during a sharp 19% price drop in mid-July. His conviction stems from Ripple‚Äôs fundamental utility in cross-border payments and its pursuit of a U.S. national banking license, a move he believes will legitimize XRP‚Äôs role in institutional finance. He argues that if XRP‚Äôs market cap were to eventually rival Bitcoin‚Äôs, the token could climb as high as $36.42. While that‚Äôs a far cry from the $1,000 mark, it lays the foundation for future exponential growth as adoption increases over time. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Realistic Expectations vs. Lofty Ambitions At the time of writing, XRP trades at $3.22, with modest short-term forecasts pointing toward resistance at $3.60‚Äì$3.90 and more optimistic projections topping out around $6.90. Long-term models suggest XRP could hit $10 to $15 by the end of the decade if key regulatory and adoption milestones are met. However, projections of $100 or more remain speculative and depend heavily on global financial integration. Final Thoughts: Patience Required Armando Pantoja‚Äôs vision is not about short-term price action but a patient, utility-driven rally fueled by adoption and clarity. His call for a 33,233% return reflects confidence in XRP‚Äôs long-term fundamentals. But even he acknowledges: it won‚Äôt happen overnight. For now, XRP remains a project in transition, still shaking off legal shadows and awaiting its next major breakout.

It was determined that Feng and his accomplices converted this money into Bitcoin and laundered it using ‚Äúcoin mixing‚Äù methods. Eight people were sentenced to prison and fines. More than 90 Bitcoins were seized and turned over to authorities. According to the People's Daily, Feng was responsible for approving applications for service providers and developing and implementing incentive policies for the short-form video platform he worked for. In the rewards and incentive policies the company regularly offered to stimulate growth, Feng exploited his position to create loopholes in the system. He shared these loopholes with his external partners, Tang and Yang, and transferred millions of yuan worth of incentives using forged application documents. Related News: How Much of Ethereum's Supply Is Lost Forever? Here's the Amount That Must Be Excluded When Calculating Supply Multiple front companies were established by individuals affiliated with Tang and Yang to conceal the corrupt proceeds. These companies were used to collect the stimulus payments, which were then quickly funneled into secret accounts ultimately controlled by Yang. Feng and his associates used eight different overseas cryptocurrency exchanges to launder the money by converting 140 million yuan of funds into cryptocurrencies. A significant portion of the funds, made difficult to track through coin mixing, were converted into Bitcoin. Feng and his seven co-defendants were sentenced by the Beijing Haidian District People's Court to prison terms ranging from three to 14 years and six months, as well as fines, for ‚Äúembezzlement through abuse of office.‚Äù The verdict is final.

2025-07-27T17:07:15,"Ripple Co-Founder‚Äôs Big XRP Transfer Sparks New Warnings","XRP investors are worried again after Ripple Labs co-founder, Chris Larsen, moved 50 million XRP tokens to crypto exchanges. The move has triggered warnings from market analysts. Experts are advising holders to protect themselves from becoming ‚Äúexit liquidity.‚Äù This term refers to a situation where large players sell at high prices, leaving smaller investors to bear the losses. Analysts Say Larger XRP Sell-Off May Be Underway A. Maartunn, a contributor to CryptoQuant, was among the first to raise concerns. In a recent X post , he noted that despite losing over $100 million worth of XRP, Larsen still holds a large amount of the token. The industry leader currently owns about 2.58 billion XRP, valued at around $8.83 billion. Maartunn warned that the recent 50 million XRP sale could be just a small part of what might come next. The alert came shortly after XRP reached a price of $3.60 on July 17, marking a near all-time high. XRP recently became one of the best-performing coins during the market‚Äôs rebound. However, the excitement did not last long after analysts spotted large withdrawals from a wallet linked to Larsen. As of now, XRP is trading at $3.18, down 1.06% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. This represents a 13% drop from its recent high , causing small investors to become more worried, especially those who bought in with the expectation that the price would continue to rise. Ripple Sale Comes Amid Broader Market Turmoil The timing of Larsen‚Äôs transaction coincided with market uncertainty, exacerbating investor fear. At the same time, XRP prices were reacting to the sale, and Bitcoin (BTC) was also experiencing sharp downside pressure. An early Bitcoin investor, known as a ‚ÄúSatoshi-era whale,‚Äù has sold 80,000 BTC after holding it for 14 years. The sale, managed by Galaxy Digital, temporarily pushed Bitcoin‚Äôs price down to around $114,500 before it bounced back to $118,356. This sudden price swing affected the whole crypto market. In just 24 hours, over $500 million was lost in forced trades, according to CoinGlass. These losses primarily affected traders who had leveraged funds to trade and were forced to close their positions when prices moved too quickly. Mixed Reaction from the Community The cryptocurrency community has held differing opinions about Larsen‚Äôs move. Some people argue that it is normal for long-term holders to take profits, especially when prices rise. Others believe the sale was planned to capitalize on the recent price surge, potentially harming smaller investors who purchased during the excitement. Some traders also warned about the risks of copying large wallets without careful consideration. They said these moves can shake the market and leave small investors at risk.

2025-07-27T17:00:22,"Is It Time To Exchange Bitcoin For TRON? This Metric Says TRX Is About To Outperform BTC","The price of Bitcoin has continued to impress investors in 2025 despite doubts after the top crypto hit a six-figure valuation at the tail end of 2024. As a result, the expectations of an altcoin season have seemed like a pipe dream so far this year. Nevertheless, that is not to say the altcoin market has not seen outstanding performers in 2025 ‚Äî one of them being TRON (TRX). According to data from CoinGecko, the price of TRX is up by about 25% year-to-date. TRX In Underperformance Zone Relative To BTC On Saturday, July 26, Alphractal CEO & founder Joao Wedson took to the social media platform X to analyze the dynamics between Bitcoin and TRON, two of the largest assets in the crypto market. According to the on-chain expert, the TRX token might outpace the premier cryptocurrency in the coming months. Related Reading: Ripple CEO Sounds Alarm: If You‚Äôre An XRP Investor, You Should See This This interesting prediction is based on the TRX Opportunity Score metric, which tracks when the TRON token is outperforming or underperforming Bitcoin. Typically, this metric combines various indicators, including the TRX/BTC ratio, daily returns, volatility, Beta, and correlation. According to Wedson, the current TRX Opportunity Score suggests a potential turning point for the TRON price relative to the price of Bitcoin. The on-chain analyst revealed that the altcoin has once again entered a zone of underperformance relative to BTC ‚Äî a phenomenon that has preceded strong reversals in the past. Wedson explained that every time TRON dropped into the red or orange zones on the chart (indicating weakness), it often began strong relative upward trends and went on to outperform Bitcoin. ‚ÄúThis pattern has repeated across several past cycles ‚Äî and it seems to be forming once again,‚Äù the on-chain expert added. With TRON seemingly bound to outpace Bitcoin in the coming weeks, Wedson suggested that investors might want to consider rotating some capital from BTC into TRX. ‚ÄúIt may be strategically interesting to consider rotating a small portion of BTC into TRX, aiming to front-run a possible TRX outperformance in the coming months,‚Äù the Alphractal CEO said. Bitcoin And TRON Price As of this writing, the price of BTC sits just beneath $118,100, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past month. In comparison, TRON is valued at around $0.3197, with an almost 18% price growth in the past 30 days.

2025-07-27T17:00:00,"Michael Saylor Is Bringing Bitcoin-Backed Money-Market-Style Vehicle to Wall Street: NYDIG","Strategy (MSTR) is pulling off some form of financial alchemy: using bitcoin, historically a volatile asset, to create something that looks a lot like stability. That‚Äôs the firm‚Äôs $2 billion ‚ÄúStretch‚Äù Preferred Stock (STRC) offering offers a variable 9% dividend and is designed to keep the share price hovering near $100. The offering doesn‚Äôt give investors direct bitcoin exposure, yet it's backed by the asset in spirit and structure, according to a recent NYDIG report. Strategy holds $71.7 billion in bitcoin and just $11 billion in liabilities, giving it room to deliver income even if crypto prices dip, the report notes. Historically, bitcoin has returned at least 3%‚Äì4% annually over any five-year stretch, while average returns have been significantly higher. Strategy is betting it can use this return profile to sustain high payouts without touching its crypto stash, essentially turning long-term bitcoin appreciation into monthly cash flow. ‚ÄúSTRC looks to us like a high-yield, bitcoin-backed, money-market-style vehicle, designed to trade near $100 par while offering a far higher yield than traditional short-term instruments, albeit with a different liquidity profile,‚Äù NYDIG wrote. That premise has proven popular. Investor interest drove Strategy to quadruple the offering size from $500 million to $2 billion. STRC may not just be a yield vehicle, but rather bitcoin, reworked for traditional finance income investors. A kind of money-market fund, remixed with crypto under the hood.
