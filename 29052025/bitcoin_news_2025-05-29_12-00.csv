Despite that, Pakistan has announced plans to establish a government-led Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, signaling a major shift from its previous anti-crypto stance. Bilal bin Saqib, head of the Pakistan Crypto Council, revealed the initiative at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, praising the United States for inspiring the move. He emphasized that the Bitcoins will be held indefinitely and not sold, marking a long-term commitment rather than a speculative play. This will be the ultimate chance for Pakistan to become the first South Asian country to take such a bold step into the future of decentralized finance. As of April 2025, the US governments collectively hold 463,741 BTC, representing around 2.3% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Today, rewrites history.

However, the global wave of crypto adoption, especially moves by the US, has influenced Pakistan to soften its stance in 2025. The country is now actively building its crypto infrastructure, led by the Pakistan Crypto Council, which aims to boost blockchain innovation, stablecoins, and decentralized finance in the country. Strategic Partnerships and Supportive Policies Earlier this year, Pakistan signed a Letter of Intent with US-based World Liberty Financial, a firm connected to President Donald Trump’s family. This agreement focuses on collaboration in asset tokenization, stablecoin projects, and decentralized finance regulations. The government is also backing crypto mining by allocating 2,000 megawatts of power for mining and AI infrastructure. A legal framework for digital assets is expected in the upcoming federal budget. With about 25 million active crypto users and an annual transaction volume of $300 billion, Pakistan’s recent efforts show a clear national strategy to become a significant player in the global crypto market. The Bitcoin reserve is part of this broader vision, reflecting the country’s desire to embrace blockchain technology and digital finance on a serious scale.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/pakistan-to-launch-bitcoin-strategic-reserve-inspired-by-u-s-crypto-moves/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MINING|REGULATION","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-05-29T09:55:39.000Z,"$750K in One Day—Bitcoin Pepe 72 Hours from Tier 1 Launch Frenzy","The post $750K in One Day—Bitcoin Pepe 72 Hours from Tier 1 Launch Frenzy appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Meme season is back—and it’s not on Ethereum or Solana. It’s about to happen for the first time ever on Bitcoin thanks to Bitcoin Pepe , and investors need to strap in. Trillions of dollars are about to flow into meme coins, and nobody, not even the most hardcore degen traders, are ready for what could happen if BPEP hits terminal velocity. BPEP is the world’s first meme-centric layer 2 built on BTC, and it has just raised a staggering $750,000 in a single day as the countdown to its May 31st launch begins. Rumors of a Tier 1 CEX listing are swirling, and the end of this month may mark the start of a historical capital rotation. Smart money knows, and it is not buying BTC, which has already pumped, but BPEP—knowing that it is the perfect leveraged asset to front-run the massive capital rotation into Bitcoin-based meme coins. With $12m raised already, the fireworks are about to go off. How Bitcoin Pepe caught the perfect narrative Bitcoin Pepe is a visionary Layer 2 built on top of Bitcoin, combining the meme coin energy with the best-in-class security and liquidity from BTC. Bitcoin looks ready to shoot to $155K, and BPEP will be following it closely, making it the perfect trade for anyone bullish on BTC’s next evolution. Bitcoin has never had speculative trading and has become crypto’s boomer asset. That was until Bitcoin Pepe decided to build ‘Solana on Bitcoin.’ The driving force behind BPEP is its brand-new PEP-20 token standard, and now this crypto presale is about to unleash Ethereum’s ERC-20 moment on Bitcoin, but with 10 times more liquidity. BPEP is actively redefining Bitcoin’s role in crypto from digital gold to ground zero for meme coin trading and DeFi activity. This layer 2 provides lightning-fast transactions, negligible fees, and the seamless trading experience that retail loves. It has an enormous first-mover advantage, perfectly timed with BTC’s explosive price action—the perfect conditions for a massive 100X rally. Bitcoin Pepe: What happens when a layer 2 unlocks $2 trillion in dormant capital? Bitcoin Pepe’s native bridge could attract trillions of dormant BTC capital to fuel a meme coin rally far larger than anything seen last year on Solana. And all of this economic activity is feeding back to BPEP, the native token. The PEP-20 token standard could go down as one of crypto’s most important unlocks, doing for Bitcoin what ERC-20 did for Ethereum. But BPEP hasn’t gone mainstream yet, and that’s why it provides such a fantastic and intriguing trade opportunity. BPEP is a perfect pick-and-shovel play for the future of BTC, and almost all investors are still debating where to dig. The current price of $0.0377 won’t last long, and in crypto, the spoils go to those who move fastest. Raising $750K in 24 hours as Tier 1 CEX listing rapidly approaches Bitcoin Pepe is about to eat the entire meme coin economy and smashed a massive $750K in just 24 hours. This is the signal for anyone paying attention that a high-velocity capital rotation into the Bitcoin meme ecosystem is about to take place. Having a Tier 1 listing already inked before launch shows that the industry’s big players are similarly bullish on BPEP, and on listing day alone, BPEP could pump as much as 87% . Most presales struggle to gain traction, yet BPEP has already raised an impressive $12m and secured a listing. Investors have 72 hours left until BPEP lists, and once live on a Tier 1 CEX, retail will start panic buying. The pre-launch price of $0.0377 will disappear forever. Bitcoin Pepe is about to run the SOL 2021 playbook again, but this time with way more liquidity, and the window to front-run this opportunity is disappearing fast.

2025-05-29T09:50:34.000Z,"Bitcoin: Bold Trump Sons Predict $170K+ Price by 2026","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: Bold Trump Sons Predict $170K+ Price by 2026 Get ready, crypto enthusiasts! A significant forecast has emerged from a rather unexpected corner of the political landscape. Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, sons of former U.S. President Donald Trump, have stepped into the Bitcoin prediction arena, offering a remarkably bullish outlook for the coming years. Their comments, made at a major industry event, are certainly turning heads and adding another layer to the ongoing conversation about Bitcoin’s future. What is the Trump Bitcoin Prediction? During the Bitcoin 2025 conference held in Las Vegas, both Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump shared their thoughts on the potential trajectory of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. According to reports from The Block, Eric Trump stated his belief that Bitcoin has the potential to exceed the $170,000 mark by the end of 2026. Donald Trump Jr. reportedly echoed this optimistic sentiment, aligning with the ambitious target set by his brother. This Trump Bitcoin prediction is noteworthy not just for the price target itself, but for the source. Coming from individuals associated with a prominent political family, it signals a growing awareness and perhaps even acceptance of Bitcoin within mainstream circles, albeit from a personal investment perspective rather than official policy. The Michael Saylor Connection and Trump Family Crypto An interesting detail shared by Eric Trump sheds light on the family’s foray into the digital asset space. Eric credited Michael Saylor, the co-founder of MicroStrategy (now known as Strategy), as a key figure who helped guide the Trump family’s move into crypto. Saylor, a well-known Bitcoin maximalist and proponent of corporate Bitcoin treasury strategies, appears to have played an influential role in introducing the Trumps to the world of digital assets. Eric mentioned that Saylor inspired their recent “treasury experiments.” While the exact nature and scale of these experiments in Trump family crypto holdings weren’t detailed, this suggests that the family has not only been learning about crypto but actively engaging with it, potentially exploring ways to incorporate it into their financial holdings or business operations. This connection highlights the impact that influential figures like Saylor can have on bringing new participants, even those from traditional finance or political backgrounds, into the crypto ecosystem. Why $170,000 by 2026? Factors Influencing the Bitcoin Price 2026 Outlook Predicting the future price of any asset, especially one as volatile as Bitcoin, is inherently challenging. While the Trump sons didn’t provide a detailed breakdown of their methodology for arriving at the $170,000+ target for Bitcoin price 2026 , we can look at general factors often cited by analysts and proponents that could drive such growth: Increasing Institutional Adoption: More corporations, asset managers, and traditional financial institutions are allocating capital to Bitcoin, viewing it as a store of value or a hedge against inflation. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. is a prime example of infrastructure being built for easier institutional access. Growing Retail Interest: As Bitcoin becomes more mainstream and accessible, more individual investors are likely to enter the market, increasing demand. Halving Cycles: Bitcoin undergoes a ‘halving’ event approximately every four years, which cuts the rate at which new Bitcoin is created by half. This supply shock has historically preceded significant price rallies. The most recent halving occurred in April 2024. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic uncertainty, inflation fears, and changes in monetary policy by central banks can drive investors towards alternative assets like Bitcoin. Technological Development: Ongoing improvements to the Bitcoin network and surrounding infrastructure (like the Lightning Network) can enhance its utility and scalability. It’s important to remember that price predictions, including this one from Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, are speculative and subject to many variables. Market sentiment, regulatory changes, and unforeseen global events can all significantly impact Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Putting the Prediction in Perspective: Is $170K Realistic? A $170,000+ price tag by late 2026 would represent a substantial increase from current levels (assuming the article is written sometime after early 2024). While ambitious, it’s not the highest prediction circulating in the crypto space, but it is certainly on the more bullish side. Many analysts and models suggest six-figure targets are possible in the coming years, particularly post-halving. Consider these points when evaluating the forecast: Prediction Source Target Price (Example) Target Year (Example) Trump Sons (Eric & Donald Jr.) $170,000+ 2026 Various Analysts/Models (Range) $100,000 – $500,000+ 2024 – 2030 Michael Saylor (Strategy) Long-term bullish (Specific near-term targets vary) Ongoing accumulation This particular prediction gains traction due to the individuals making it and the context of the Bitcoin 2025 conference. It serves as a talking point and reflects a certain level of conviction among some prominent figures entering the space. Challenges and Considerations for Bitcoin’s Growth While the optimism around a $170,000+ Bitcoin price 2026 is compelling, several challenges could impact its path: Regulatory Uncertainty: Governments worldwide are still grappling with how to regulate cryptocurrencies. Unfavorable regulations could stifle adoption and innovation. Market Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its dramatic price swings. Sharp downturns can test investor confidence. Security Risks: Hacking, scams, and loss of private keys remain risks for individual holders. Competition: While Bitcoin is dominant, other cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies are evolving. Public Perception: Despite increasing adoption, skepticism and negative narratives persist. These factors highlight the speculative nature of investing in Bitcoin and the importance of a long-term perspective. Actionable Insights for Readers What should you take away from this Trump Bitcoin prediction ? It’s a Prediction, Not a Guarantee: Treat this forecast, like all price predictions, as an opinion based on current information and future assumptions. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before making any investment decisions based on predictions, thoroughly research Bitcoin, its underlying technology, market trends, and potential risks. Understand the Context: The prediction comes from individuals who are relatively new to the space compared to seasoned crypto veterans, though they have been influenced by a major figure like Michael Saylor. Consider the Source: The Trump family’s increasing openness to crypto is a notable development, reflecting a broader trend of mainstream interest. Stay Informed: Follow reputable news sources and analysts to get a balanced view of market sentiment and fundamental developments. The mention of Trump family crypto involvement, guided by Michael Saylor, adds a layer of intrigue and suggests that high-profile individuals and families are actively exploring digital assets beyond just casual interest. Conclusion: A Bullish Sign from a Surprising Source The prediction from Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump that Bitcoin could surpass $170,000 by the end of 2026 is a significant and bullish statement. While ambitious, it reflects a growing optimism within certain circles regarding Bitcoin’s future value. The acknowledgment of Michael Saylor’s influence underscores the role key figures play in educating and onboarding new participants, even those from prominent political backgrounds, into the world of Trump family crypto and beyond. As the crypto market continues to evolve, such predictions serve as interesting markers of sentiment and potential targets. However, prudent investors will always combine such forecasts with their own thorough research and a clear understanding of the inherent risks involved in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. The journey towards the predicted Bitcoin price 2026 will undoubtedly be dynamic and influenced by a multitude of global factors.

2025-05-29T09:50:22.000Z,"Trader Charts XRP Path towards 109,000% Rocket Rally. Here’s the Timeline","Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto), a prominent analyst on X, recently shared a chart outlining an ambitious trajectory for XRP, suggesting a potential path to $2,500 per token by 2030. While the chart itself does not specify catalysts, several major developments have fueled renewed optimism among XRP supporters and may provide the foundation for such bold projections. #XRP ROAD TO $2,500 pic.twitter.com/0K4M3o6N10 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) May 27, 2025 CME Group’s XRP Futures Launch One of the most significant recent milestones for XRP is the recent launch of XRP futures by CME Group, a leading derivatives marketplace. This long-anticipated move introduced both micro (2,500 XRP) and standard (50,000 XRP) cash-settled contracts, benchmarked against the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate. CME’s inclusion of XRP in its crypto derivatives suite, which already features Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, reflects the growing institutional and retail interest in the asset and its underlying technology, the XRP Ledger (XRPL). The introduction of regulated futures is widely seen as a precursor to spot ETF approval , which could further legitimize XRP in the eyes of institutional investors and drive additional liquidity to the market. Ripple Lawsuit Nears Resolution Progress in the long-running legal battle between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also contributed to positive sentiment. In April 2025, both parties filed a joint motion to pause their appeals , a move granted by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The community is anticipating the end of the lawsuit. Despite some recent procedural challenges , both parties work together to gain approval of their settlement agreement and put an end to the legal dispute. Dubai’s Tokenized Real Estate Initiative on XRPL Another major development is Dubai’s selection of the XRPL to power a new real estate tokenization initiative. The Dubai Land Department, in partnership with Prypco and Ctrl Alt, aims to take over the $16 billion market through tokenization. This project will enable fractional property ownership, making real estate investment accessible to a broader audience and increasing the utility and adoption of XRPL-backed solutions. This integration of blockchain-based records is expected to set a new standard for transparency and efficiency in property transactions, introducing XRP to an untapped market. Is XRP Going to $2,500? XRP is currently trading at $2.26 with a market cap of $136.64 billion. Reaching $2,500 with its current circulating supply of 58.68 billion would place its market cap at over $146 trillion. While this market cap seems unrealistic to many, experts have debunked the market cap myth, suggesting that XRP can reach thousands of dollars without any limitations.

2025-05-29T09:45:58.000Z,"Bitcoin (BTC) Gears Up for next Rally: Price Analysis","The institutions are still buying, and a new sovereign treasury is in the pipeline for Pakistan. With Bitcoin (BTC) continuing to hold above the $106,000 support level, the next rally could be brewing. Increasing buying interest for Bitcoin The US Spot Bitcoin ETFs have just recorded their 10th day of positive inflows as another 3.97K BTC entered the coffers. This was all swallowed up by the Blackrock IBIT ETF with just a couple of small negative outflows from ARKB (315 BTC) and FBTC (128 BTC). These last 10 days brought in a total of more than 36K BTC. As an ever-increasing number of companies announce that they are setting up their own Bitcoin treasuries, a new sovereign country has thrown its hat into the ring. It was announced at Bitcoin Vegas 2025 on Day 3 that Pakistan would establish a national bitcoin wallet as part of a “government-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve”. The Pakistani representative at the Bitcoin conference said that the country would devote 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity to Bitcoin mining, and that digital assets already owned by the government would be kept in the national Bitcoin wallet and held long-term. $BTC price action moves sideways within wedge Source: TradingView The short-term price action for $BTC shows that the $106,000 support is holding up well. More sideways price movement has revealed $BTC to be inside a wedge. The Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart has the indicators climbing, which could enable positive price momentum to lift the price up to the top of the wedge and the resistance formed by the January all-time high. The current rally would get very bullish if the price can get above $110,760 which would make a higher high. Moving averages are sorting themselves into order Source: TradingView The daily chart for $BTC indicates that the price may be about to fall underneath the ascending trendline that stretches back to early April. However, there is still the rest of the day for the bulls to regain this trendline. The three major simple moving averages are displayed, and this reveals that a golden cross has just taken place, as the 50 SMA (blue) crosses above both the 100 (green) and 200 (red) SMAs. In order to start being extremely bullish, the 100 (green) SMA must now also cross above the 200 (red) SMA. When the SMAs were in order last time, the first big run-up to over $100,000 was able to occur. Bull market cycle to end in Q4? Source: TradingView The above chart is the 3-monthly and it reveals that from the 2013 bull market top to the next top in 2017, a total of 16 3-month candles were needed. For the next bull market cycle until the top in 2021, exactly 16 candles were printed again. We enter the current bull market cycle and so far we are in candle 14, which will take us to the end of June. Could this mean that there are another two 3-month candles to be printed before we hit the top of this cycle in Q4 of this year? This could certainly be a possibility. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI for this timeframe is showing that there is still a little way to go before the indicator lines hit the peak (blue line).

2025-05-29T09:39:45.000Z,"Here’s why Moonchain’s MXC rallied over 240% today","MXC, the native token of the Layer 3 blockchain platform Moonchain, surged as much as 247% recently, thanks to the reactivation of its mining program and a wave of ecosystem updates. According to Coingecko data, Moonchain ( MXC ) reached an intraday high of $0.00525 on the morning of May 29, Asian time, pushing its market cap past $11.6 million. When writing, the token was up 675% from its lowest point this year, marking one of its strongest moves in 2025 so far. MXC crypto also recorded a sharp uptick in trading activity, with daily volume spiking over 500% compared to the previous day, reaching nearly $22.5 million, signalling a flood of new interest and momentum. What’s behind the rally? There are three main catalysts driving MXC’s breakout: First, the Moonchain team officially reactivated MXC mining on its network using MatchX’s M2 Pro and NEO miners, following a temporary outage on May 21. This reactivation also came after a community poll conducted by MatchX on X on May 19, where 97.9% of participants voted in favor of resuming MXC mining. For context, MatchX is a German tech company that builds low-energy mining hardware specifically for the Moonchain ecosystem. Their devices help power Moonchain’s data infrastructure and allow users to earn MXC by participating in its Proof of Participation (PoP) system. Second, Moonchain teased the upcoming launch of its Initial Hardware Offering (IHO). This campaign will send out free physical mining devices, possibly wearables like smartwatches or rings, to Moonchain token holders using an Ethereum smart contract. You might also like: SEC delays Grayscale’s Avalanche and Cardano ETF decisions to July According to the project’s Q2 2025 roadmap, the IHO will also include “health-based” mining devices and limited-edition high-hash-rate models to reward users who lock up their tokens early. Distribution hubs are also being set up in key regions to ensure faster deliveries. Third, Moonchain recently completed an integration with OKX Wallet , a leading multi-chain wallet in the Web3 space. The integration allows users to easily access Moonchain’s dApps, staking features, and token tools across mobile, browser, and Telegram. With OKX Wallet ’s support for over 1,000 protocols, the move better positions both existing and new users to engage with the ecosystem. What Is Moonchain? For those unfamiliar, Moonchain is a Layer 3 blockchain platform that combines AI, IoT, and DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks). Its native token, MXC, powers transactions within the network, supports an inter-chain NFT marketplace, and rewards participants via its energy-efficient Proof of Participation model. The project also features MXProtocol and is building on Ethereum’s Layer 2 tech, including its own zkEVM , to improve compatibility with existing Ethereum-based apps. This positions Moonchain as a solid pick for developers working on real-world use cases, especially in smart devices and data-sharing networks. MXC price outlook On the technical side, MXC has broken out of a multi-month descending channel, which often signals the start of a potential new uptrend. It also held above the key 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.0048 before cooling off to around $0.0041 at press time. MXC price, MACD and RSI chart — May 29 | Source: crypto.news Momentum indicators support the bullish case. The MACD lines are crossing upward, and the Relative Strength Index is in the overbought zone, often a sign of sustained buying pressure and strong buyer conviction in an emerging uptrend. However, overbought conditions can also bring short-term selling pressure if traders begin to lock in profits. If MXC continues upward, the next likely target is around $0.0061, a key level it failed to reach in its earlier push. But if it drops below the $0.0030 support, it could slide further down toward the $0.00060 range, which is currently acting as a psychological support zone.

Last April, another U.K.-listed company, Abraxas Capital, purchased nearly 3,000 BTC, which was worth $250 million at the time of purchase.

2025-05-29T09:34:47.000Z,"Larsen said Ripple did not fund the Bitcoin \""Change the Code\"" campaign","Chris Larsen, co-founder of Ripple, has clarified that the company was not behind the funding of the controversial “Change the Code” campaign. The initiative, in partnership with Greenpeace, set out to pressure the Bitcoin community into dumping its energy-intensive proof of work (PoW) consensus model. Larsen added that he supported the campaign personally rather than as a corporate action by Ripple. He also cited progress in Bitcoin’s energy profile. He referred to a University of Cambridge study that points out that mining today uses large increments of renewable energy, including nuclear, wind, and hydropower. In addition, more flared gas energy that would otherwise go to waste is being used to power mining operations. Despite that, the campaign continues to fuel criticism. The initiative is deemed anti-Bitcoin by many in the Bitcoin community, with some accusing Ripple of pushing it as a way to plant a seed of doubt within the Bitcoin network and promote XRP instead. In early 2023 when I funded the “Change the Code” campaign, my goal was to see if there was a way to turn Bitcoin into an accelerator for direct air capture. The campaign didn’t work, and that’s ok!

Bitcoin’s energy transition in the… https://t.co/qIcadDtzDu — Chris Larsen (@chrislarsensf) May 28, 2025 Ripple’s symbolic donation sparks controversy The latest donation made by Ripple of the ‘Skull of Satoshi’ to the Bitcoin community has stirred both praise and criticism as well. The artwork, once used as Bitcoin’s energy consumption ultimatum, was officially handed over at the 2025 Bitcoin Conference in Las Vegas. Currently, it’s on display in the Bitcoin Museum in Nashville. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse called the gesture an olive branch. According to him, Bitcoin serves as a resilient system and advises the crypto industry to adhere to common goals, including innovation, regulatory clarity, and financial inclusion. Garlinghouse said he hoped the donation would be a reminder that the industry’s different communities have more in common than not. Although there have been disagreements in the past, Garlinghouse said that Ripple’s current stand is to collaborate with the industry rather than compete. Top executives at Ripple have also publicly denied the charges that the company lobbied against having a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) in the United States. Ripple has also said that it supports a multi-asset approach to the national crypto reserve structure. Not everyone shared the sentiment. Head of Digital Assets at VanEck Matthew Sigel slammed the move. Sigel dismissed the sculpture and instead demanded a formal apology for Ripple funding Greenpeace’s anti-Bitcoin efforts, asking him on X, “Is that your apology?” Some criticized the popular XRP lawyer John Deaton for attending Bitcoin 2025, referring to him as an “XRP guy.” David Schwartz, Ripple CTO, also argued back at Bitcoin maximalists that XRP is not centralized as the ledger is without an issuer and remains decentralized even with Ripple’s influence. XRP price stagnates despite VivoPower boost Market response to Ripple’s outreach has been lukewarm. Despite the recent developments, XRP traded at $2.29, more than 5% down for the week. Yet, it has done little to move XRP. Over the past week, the token traded at $2.24 to $2.47, appearing to consolidate. The trading volume was up 28% to $2.63 billion. Also, the onchain volume of XRP has surged, up 21.7% over the last day. While CoinGlass’s data also shows derivatives volume surged 20.2% to $3.95 billion, open interest dropped 0.95% to $4.78 billion, indicating a mixed sentiment among leveraged traders. Technical indicators lack near-term momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 46 in neutral territory. The 100- and 200-day SMAs remain above current prices, but the 10 – and 30-day EMAs and SMAs all flash sell signals. A rally above $2.40 could send the exchange rate toward $2.60, but a decline under $2.24 could lead to $2.10.

2025-05-29T09:31:12.000Z,"Silent Payments: The upgrade Bitcoin can’t afford to ignore | Opinion","Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. While Bitcoin ( BTC ) may have started out with the perception of “anonymous internet money,” the reality of Bitcoin being transparent-by-design has finally started to take hold in the space. While Bitcoin offers powerful censorship-resistance and decentralization in theory, a lack of accessible privacy features drastically limits its effectiveness in harsher environments. Political dissidents seeking funding, journalists accepting donations, and whistleblowers raising support have all started to realize that Bitcoin is actually the world’s most efficient and largest financial surveillance system, mapping who paid whom, when, and how much. You might also like: How to build a 1B TPS blockchain without decentralization, security, or shame | Opinion Imagine for a moment that anytime you entered your credit card number online or shared your Venmo info with a friend, that person could simply Google your info and learn when you had received money, how much you get paid, and where you spend your hard-earned money. That nightmare scenario is a reality for most users of Bitcoin today, but thankfully, there are brilliant minds working to make privacy great again on Bitcoin. Silent payments ‘address’ the problem In 2022, a legendary Bitcoin developer and researcher named Ruben Somsen made a startling proposal out of nowhere: what if we could bring the same level of privacy when receiving Bitcoin as people expect, all without any changes to Bitcoin itself? This concept was quickly named ‘Silent Payments’ and is a new address type for Bitcoin that allows you to create a single, static address to share with friends, use for donations, or post for tips without sacrificing privacy. When someone wants to send you a payment, they use the unique public key that is a part of your Silent Payment address, combine it with the public keys of the outputs they want to send, and generate a unique, one-time address that looks on-chain just like any other regular Bitcoin payment. While the concept of a “stealth address” has existed in Bitcoin for many years, all previous attempts had deep flaws that greatly limited the user experience or privacy offered. Silent Payments are stealth addresses, perfected. Silent Payments beautifully addresses the most prevalent privacy issues when receiving Bitcoin, all while actually simplifying the experience and getting Bitcoin much closer to that Venmo-like dream. All any Bitcoin user needs now is one address that never changes, and they can easily receive Bitcoin while preserving their privacy and that of the sender, anytime, any day. Even better, we can now use these Silent Payment addresses to build out powerful username systems like CashApp’s CashTags, all without a trusted middleman or a loss of privacy! Better privacy meets better user experience. Silent Payments are here, but adoption is not Like any new technology, the most pressing issue for Silent Payments is now education and adoption. While wallets like Cake Wallet have led the way in empowering their users to leverage Silent Payments since 2024, wallet adoption has been slow on the uptake. Many wallets and companies have signaled their support for the concept of Silent Payments, but most are waiting on upstream libraries to add native support and simplify the integration process. In the meantime, however, many wallets have already started to support the simplest part of Silent Payments—allowing you to send to a Silent Payments address, but not allowing you to receive to one. This is far easier from an integration standpoint and is rapidly gaining adoption. Once a few other major wallets in the space take the time to enhance their users’ privacy through Silent Payments, a snowball effect of adoption will make this upgrade to Bitcoin’s privacy unstoppable. The sooner we can get away from the broken paradigm of constantly-rotating Bitcoin addresses and shattered privacy expectations, the faster we can grow the number of people experiencing freedom money like never before. The adoption of Silent Payments is inevitable, but you can help speed up the progress of Bitcoin like never before simply by asking your favorite wallet to implement Silent Payment support today! Privacy: Choose it or lose it Unlike many promising privacy improvements to Bitcoin, Silent Payments requires no code changes to the Bitcoin project, has no impact on fees, and doesn’t need any costly rough consensus. It’s time that we choose to reclaim our privacy each time we use Bitcoin, transaction by transaction, through the power of Silent Payments. We cannot normalize our finances being transparent to the world if we want to continue to preserve human freedom. This oversharing needs to end and can end…silently.

2025-05-29T09:30:13.000Z,"Dogecoin Is About To Enter It’s Worst Month In History – Why June Could Be Bloody","With the month of May drawing to a quick close, it looks like the Dogecoin price is about to end its second month in a row in the green. This has come as a welcome surprise in a month where expectations were that the market would continue to go down. However, this means that Dogecoin is about to enter what has historically been the worst month since its inception, with more red closes than green. Why The Dogecoin Price Could Go Down In June The month of June has been known to be very bad for the Dogecoin price, and this has been the case for most of the last 11 years. In more than a decade, the Dogecoin price has only closed out the month of June in the green twice, and this was back when it was still a rather new cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Forget Dogecoin At $1: Price Could Rally To $12 If History Repeats Itself As data from the CryptoRank website shows, the only years that the month of June has ended in the green for Dogecoin have been 2015 and 2016. Before that, June 2014 had closed in the red, with a loss of 21.4%, and after 2016, Dogecoin had racked up losses for the month of June every single year. From 2017 to 2024, Dogecoin has ended the month of June in the red every single time without fail. June 2017 ended in -2.38%, June 2018 ended in 27.2%, June 2019 ended in -4.36%, June 2020 ended in -9.94%, June 2021 ended in -23.9%, June 2022 ended in -23.3%, June 2023 ended in -7.18%, and June 2024 ended in -21.9%. Looking at the pattern here, it shows that even during bullish years, the month of June has not failed to end in losses for Dogecoin. Going by this established trend, it is not far off to expect the Dogecoin price to actually fall in the new month. With an average return of -7.34% over the years, making it the worst month in terms of returns for the meme coin, a decline could be in the works for the cryptocurrency. What To Expect From Here According to the machine learning algorithm at CoinCodex, the month of June may end up deviating from its established pattern. At the start, it does show a possible decline, expecting the price to fall below $0.22. However, as the month progresses, it is expected to turn around. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Bounces Off Re-Accumulation Zone: Why $120,000 Could Be Next The one-month prediction puts the Dogecoin price above $0.26, which is a 17.67% increase from the current price.

2025-05-29T09:24:17.000Z,"Best crypto to buy before May 31: Bitcoin Pepe nears $12.7M target","With just two days left before its exchange debut, Bitcoin Pepe has raised over $12.1 million of its $12.7 million target, making it one of the most closely watched meme coins in 2025. The current price of $0.0377 has drawn the attention of retail investors looking to enter before the token lists publicly on 31 May. Bitcoin Pepe is built on the Bitcoin network using the BRC-20 standard and introduces a novel upgrade called the PEP-20 protocol. The project aims to combine meme culture with faster, cheaper transaction functionality within the Bitcoin ecosystem. In contrast to Ethereum-based meme coins like Shiba Inu or Solana-native projects like Bonk, Bitcoin Pepe offers something different — a community-first token with zero taxes, a fixed supply of 420,690,000,000 BPEP, and a blockchain foundation based entirely on Bitcoin. The token’s contract ownership has been renounced, and liquidity pool tokens have been burned, ensuring no central control and full community governance. This approach has clearly resonated with crypto investors. With $12,139,893 raised at the time of writing, Bitcoin Pepe is just shy of reaching its presale goal. On platforms like Twitter and Telegram, excitement continues to grow as the countdown to listing enters its final stretch. Meme coin market strengthens as Bitcoin Pepe enters Bitcoin Pepe’s timing aligns with a broader meme coin resurgence in 2025. Established players like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have posted solid gains this year. Dogecoin, despite its uncapped supply and ageing infrastructure, continues to benefit from strong brand recognition and celebrity backing. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu has expanded its ecosystem with staking, decentralised exchanges, and NFT integration — a sign of meme tokens maturing beyond their initial novelty. Solana’s Bonk has also re-emerged as a serious contender. After a successful comeback earlier this year, it was integrated into validator operations and partnered with other Solana-native applications, reinforcing its long-term vision. But unlike Bonk, which is deeply tied to Solana’s architecture, Bitcoin Pepe offers an entirely new use case by building meme coin infrastructure on top of Bitcoin. Bitcoin Pepe’s PEP-20 standard is intended to offer Solana-like functionality — fast and inexpensive transactions — on Bitcoin. This could mark a significant shift in how Bitcoin is used beyond just a store of value, potentially unlocking more DeFi and meme-driven applications in its ecosystem. It also enables Bitcoin Pepe to serve not just as a meme token, but as a Layer-2 platform for future meme coin creation and trading on the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin Pepe vs Bonk, Dogecoin, and Sponge V2 With its upcoming listing, Bitcoin Pepe is drawing comparisons to other tokens that have capitalised on meme hype. Among them, Sponge V2 has generated attention for reviving a popular 2023 meme coin with new staking and play-to-earn features. Its pivot to gaming and utility has worked in its favour, attracting new users and rewarding long-term holders. However, Sponge V2 is still a rebrand and revival story. It does not offer the Layer-2 infrastructure or blockchain-native innovation that Bitcoin Pepe is introducing. Similarly, Bonk and Dogecoin — while more established — are increasingly viewed as legacy meme coins. They remain heavily dependent on existing sentiment and don’t introduce the same level of novelty in terms of blockchain functionality. Bitcoin Pepe , on the other hand, is actively building something new — a meme coin ecosystem that operates on Bitcoin itself. With zero tax, community-led governance, and innovative technology, the project has captured investor interest at a time when meme coins are dominating crypto headlines once again. As Bitcoin Pepe approaches its $12.7 million cap and exchange listing, its momentum suggests a potential breakout moment. Whether it can deliver on its long-term roadmap remains to be seen, but for now, it stands out as a high-upside crypto opportunity in the current market cycle.

2025-05-29T09:20:34.000Z,"Bitcoin Pepe presale hits $12.1M with 2 days to May 31 debut","Bitcoin Pepe is approaching its final presale milestone with just two days remaining until the long-awaited May 31 centralised exchange (CEX) listing. The project has already raised $12,139,762 of its $12,701,500 target, setting the stage for what could be one of the most significant meme coin launches of 2025. Built as a Layer 2 on Bitcoin, Bitcoin Pepe blends the performance of Solana with the security of BTC, bringing the viral nature of meme coins directly to the world’s most trusted blockchain. At a time when investors are chasing the next breakout opportunity, Bitcoin Pepe is positioning itself as a serious contender. Its presale has attracted global attention, not only because of its meme-driven brand, but also due to its technological foundation, which includes the PEP-20 token standard. This standard allows meme coins to be issued natively on Bitcoin’s infrastructure—something previously thought impossible. As this final countdown begins, the token price remains at $0.0377, but that won’t last long. The PEP-20 standard is Bitcoin’s DeFi unlock While Bitcoin has long been considered “digital gold,” its capabilities for decentralised finance and token creation have lagged behind Ethereum and Solana. Bitcoin Pepe aims to fix that. By introducing PEP-20, a new token standard for Bitcoin’s Layer 2, the project allows developers and communities to mint and trade meme coins directly on Bitcoin. That shift is not just about meme culture—it’s about functionality. With lower transaction fees, fast speeds, and the immutability of Bitcoin, the new Layer 2 infrastructure enables a seamless user experience similar to what investors enjoy on Solana. This opens the door to a flood of potential capital—nearly $2 trillion worth of BTC liquidity that has, until now, sat on the sidelines of DeFi and meme coin markets. Bitcoin Pepe isn’t just launching a coin; it’s laying the groundwork for an entire meme coin economy on Bitcoin. Strategic partnerships drive ecosystem use cases What separates Bitcoin Pepe from many other meme coins is its extensive ecosystem building. It’s not merely a speculative asset—it has been building partnerships that create real-world utility for its native token, BPEP. Among its partners is Plena Finance, a DeFi super app that plans to integrate BPEP into its platform for transactions and staking. GETE Network, a cross-chain gaming project, aims to embed BPEP into its gameplay mechanics. BETV, a short-form Web3 video platform, could use BPEP and PEP-20 tokens to reward content creators and manage fan engagement. From gaming to social content to decentralised finance, these integrations offer diverse entry points for BPEP beyond trading—positioning it as a functional token within emerging Web3 environments. Countdown to listing: Price set, window closing As the May 31 listing approaches, the final tokens are being sold at $0.0377. The presale structure is designed to reward early investors, with each completed stage increasing the token price by 5%. Those who joined in the early stages have already seen gains of more than 300% on paper. With only a small allocation of tokens left before the target is met, and the CEX listing just days away, this is the last chance to buy in before BPEP hits live trading markets. The launch is expected to attract significant volume, especially as the project is rumoured to be working with multiple major exchanges. This isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a full-stack Layer 2 solution bringing the virality of meme culture to Bitcoin’s solid foundation.

Now, the man crypto Twitter loves to hate is at it again, but not in the way you might think. After the Bitcoin 2025 conference, Schiff, who’s spent over a decade calling BTC a bubble made a statement on X no one saw coming: “I’m likely responsible for more people owning Bitcoin than any other individual.” Yes, really. In classic Schiff fashion, it was half insult, half self-awareness. “Every time I tell you not to buy Bitcoin, you buy more,” he quipped. But beneath the statement, there’s a deeper tension – because while Schiff might joke about driving adoption, he’s more convinced than ever that Bitcoin is doing real damage. Let’s unpack his perspective. Cult Status? Schiff Still Isn’t Buying It Schiff didn’t hold back on his usual takedown of Bitcoin’s fundamentals. He insists there’s been no real wealth creation, just redistribution. “What has happened is a massive transfer of wealth from those who bought Bitcoin and crypto early to those who bought later.” And in a line that sums up his long-running stance, he doubled down on his favorite comparison: The Bitcoin community, he said, is like “a giant cult.” It’s the kind of remark that’s guaranteed to spark outrage. The Fed, Bitcoin, and a Fight Over the Future Schiff’s recent outburst came just yesterday. He publicly slammed a new Bitcoin acquisition bill introduced by Senator Cynthia Lummis. The proposal suggests the U.S. government could use Federal Reserve funds to buy Bitcoin – potentially hundreds of billions worth. To Schiff, this is economic sabotage. “A Selfish Attempt to Enrich the Few” He argues that the bill is designed to pump the bags of early Bitcoin adopters while leaving average Americans to deal with the fallout. He argues this would only deepen the inflation crisis and destabilize the economy. And if it passes? Schiff had a harsh warning for Capitol Hill: “No member of Congress who initiated the Bitcoin buy plan is worthy of re-election.” Is Schiff Bitcoin’s Greatest Salesman? Here’s the kicker: the more Peter Schiff rails against Bitcoin, the more attention – and adoption – it seems to get. Like it or not, he’s part of the narrative now.

ETH record open interest, rising funding rates and consistent inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs fuel the rally. A classic bullish continuation pattern suggests a potential 46% climb toward $4,000 as ETH reclaims key support. Ether’s ( ETH ) price topped $2,780 on May 29 for the first time since Feb. 24. Ether was trading at $2,722 at the time of publication, up more than 4% in the last 24 hours and 50% over the last 30 days.

Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView Let’s look at the factors driving the ETH price up today. ETH open interest hits all-time highs Besides ETH’s price strength, Ether futures open interest (OI) hit a record high on May 29. This suggests that large investors are positioning for a potential rally toward $3,000 . Ether futures aggregate open interest, ETH. Source: CoinGlass The aggregate OI in Ether futures rose 17% over five days, hitting a record $37.3 billion on May 29. Binance, Gate.io, Bybit, and Bitget collectively dominate 51% of the market, while the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) holds 8% of ETH open interest, according to CoinGlass data. Also backing Ether’s upside are positive funding rates in ETH perpetual futures markets. Funding rates represent the periodic payments exchanged between long and short-position holders. This metric has increased to 0.0050% from $0.0090% over the same period. ETH funding rates across all exchanges. Source: CoinGlass This rise in OI shows more traders are entering the market and opening new positions. Higher funding rates indicate that more traders are going long (betting on higher prices) and are willing to pay to keep those positions open. Both metrics signal bullish bias among ETH futures traders. Ether price boosted by high ETF inflows Adding to Ether’s bullish momentum on May 29 is the significant inflows into US-based spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) over the last week. These investment products have recorded positive inflows for eight straight days, totaling $394.1 million, according to data from SoSoValue. Spot Ethereum ETF flows. Source: SoSoValue BlackRock’s ETHA fund, which witnessed net inflows since May 14, was the primary driver behind Ethereum ETF capital positive flows, with a total of $287.6 million in inflows over the last two weeks. Additional data from CoinShares shows increased inflows across global Ethereum investment products, with $326.2 million between May 19 and May 23. This points to an increased institutional appetite for spot Ethereum ETFs and other investment products, which is a positive catalyst for the ETH price. Related: Ethereum bulls aim for $2.7K ahead of ETH’s $2.4B options expiry Ether’s bull flags target $4,000 The ETH/USD pair is expected to resume its upward momentum after breaking out of a bull flag pattern on the daily chart, as shown in the figure below. The pattern was confirmed when the price closed above the flag’s upper boundary at $2,650 on May 27, signaling the start of a massive upward move.

The city of Richmond in Virginia says that starting May 27th, residents can apply for the fourth cohort of the Richmond Resilience Initiative (RRI) Guaranteed Basic Income (GBI) program. For this batch, the RRI will focus on supporting single parents, including guardians with custody, step parents, foster parents and other primary household caregivers. The city says eligible beneficiaries will receive $500 per month for 24 months with no strings attached. The RRI aims to improve financial stability among working families. The city says the program is part of a growing national movement that seeks to demonstrate the power of direct, unrestricted cash assistance in helping families attain greater financial independence and reduce stress. According to Richmond’s Office of Community Wealth Building (OCWB), those who participated in the RRI program used their monthly payments to meet essential needs, pay debts, invest in education and create stability for their families. Says Richmond Mayor Danny Avula, “The Richmond Resilience Initiative reflects our ongoing commitment to creating a city where families have the stability and support they need to build a better future. This is about trust, dignity, and ensuring our residents have the resources to move forward with confidence.” The application is open until June 30th.

Trump's sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, have predicted that Bitcoin could surpass $170,000 by the end of 2026, The Block reported. “Bitcoin is gaining more and more attention every day. Every day, people are allocating billions of dollars to BTC. This would allow Bitcoin to rise to between $175,000 and $150,000 by the end of 2026. And 0.1 Bitcoin will be worth a fortune.” Eric Trump says Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) founder Michael Saylor guided the Trump family’s move into Bitcoin and cryptocurrency and inspired the recent Bitcoin treasury decision. As is known, Donald Trump's company Trump Media announced a Bitcoin treasury deal worth approximately $2.5 billion.

2025-05-29T09:07:59.000Z,"New investors are turning to RUVI instead of BTC, the reason might surprise you","For years, Bitcoin has been the go-to investment for those looking to dip their toes into the cryptocurrency world. But now, a new contender is stealing its thunder. Ruvi AI, a revolutionary blockchain project that combines artificial intelligence and decentralization, is becoming the talk of the town for savvy investors. And the reasons for this shift might just surprise you. Bitcoin’s challenges in today’s market Bitcoin has long been hailed as the “gold standard” of cryptocurrencies. It’s widely recognized, highly valuable, and has withstood the test of time. However, its high entry price and slower growth potential present hurdles to new investors. For example, as of today, Bitcoin is trading at over $100,000 per coin. While its historical returns are impressive, its current valuation makes it inaccessible for many. To make matters worse, its growth has plateaued compared to its early years, leaving limited room for the life-changing returns it once delivered. This has left a gap in the market for projects that offer more affordable entry points and the potential for exponential growth. Enter Ruvi AI. What makes Ruvi AI different? Unlike Bitcoin, Ruvi AI is a new blockchain project geared towards solving real-world problems using a powerful combination of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. This decentralized AI platform is designed to revolutionize industries such as healthcare, logistics, and finance, setting it apart from legacy cryptocurrencies that lack such specialized applications. What truly sets Ruvi AI apart, though, is its affordable entry price and staggering growth potential. Affordable presale pricing Ruvi AI is currently in Phase 2 of its presale, with tokens priced at just $0.015. Compare that to Bitcoin’s six-figure price tag, and you can see why it’s turning heads among first-time investors. What’s more, Ruvi’s potential is immense, with analysts predicting it could hit a valuation of $1 per token by Q4 2025. For those who invest today, that’s a return of over 6,000%. Record-breaking presale performance Ruvi AI is already making waves. During its Phase 1 presale, the project sold over 125 million tokens, raising a whopping $1.4 million in record time. With more than 1,200 investors on board, it’s clear that the project is resonating with both retail and institutional buyers. Lucrative investment opportunities Ruvi AI is designed to reward its early backers through a tiered bonus structure that magnifies returns. Here’s a closer look at Ruvi AI’s VIP tiers: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment with 40% bonus): Total Tokens: 70,000 ( 50,000 base + 20,000 bonus ). Value at $0.07: $4,900. Value at $1: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment with 60% bonus): Total Tokens: 224,000 ( 140,000 base + 84,000 bonus ). Value at $0.07: $15,680. Value at $1: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment with 100% bonus): Total Tokens: 1,280,000 ( double the base allocation ). Value at $0.07: $89,600. Value at $1: $1,280,000. These tiers allow investors to capture life-changing returns with relatively modest initial contributions. A vision for the duture Ruvi AI isn’t just about financial gains. Its decentralized AI model has the potential to reshape how businesses operate worldwide. By using blockchain technology, Ruvi ensures transparency and security, while its AI capabilities provide unmatched analytics and automation. This combination makes it a practical and forward-thinking solution for both investors and industry players. Why investors are making the switch For many, the decision to invest in Ruvi AI over Bitcoin boils down to two words: opportunity cost. While Bitcoin remains a dependable asset, its high price and limited upside make it less appealing. Ruvi AI, on the other hand, offers a ground-floor opportunity for exponential returns. Its low price of $0.015 per token, coupled with a clear roadmap and cutting-edge technology, make it an attractive choice for both seasoned investors and newcomers. Final thoughts Bitcoin may still reign as the king of cryptocurrencies, but Ruvi AI is quickly proving itself as the new prince. Its AI-blockchain integration, record-breaking presale, and generous bonus structure make it a standout project in a crowded market. For those seeking high growth potential without the financial barrier of Bitcoin’s steep price, Ruvi AI is the clear choice. Invest in Ruvi AI today and take the first step toward a potentially game-changing financial future.

2025-05-29T09:03:23.000Z,"Why Gold and Bitcoin Are Gaining Power Again","Right now, something big is happening with the world’s money system—but it’s not being talked about loudly. Instead of central banks like the Federal Reserve creating money directly, banks themselves are stepping in by buying short-term government debt. When banks do this, their own balance sheets grow, which means more money is flowing into the economy. This creates liquidity , a fancy word for available cash—and that often boosts the prices of assets like Bitcoin and gold . This kind of money expansion also happened in the 1970s, and back then, it led to high inflation. The lesson from that time? When the value of money drops, it’s smart to own things that hold real value—like gold. Now, we’re seeing something similar today. In the U.S., the government has been spending heavily, but instead of selling long-term debt, it's mainly selling short-term bills, which are easier for banks to buy. This makes money flow faster into financial markets. At the same time, China is adding more money to its system too. But instead of trying to keep its currency strong, China is letting it weaken against gold —a sign that it’s focusing on real assets rather than paper money. All this means one thing: money is losing value , not in stores just yet, but in the financial system. That’s why gold and Bitcoin are climbing. They are not tied to any one country’s debt or currency and are often seen as safe havens when trust in government money falls. So, while bond markets are under pressure from rising debt and interest rates, people who want to protect their savings are turning to Bitcoin and gold . These are the assets that benefit when governments quietly print more money or rely on banks to do it for them.",coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/why-gold-and-bitcoin-are-gaining-power-again,"ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET","",cryptocompare

The company issued $21 million in zero-interest bonds to purchase additional Bitcoin. The company noted that the zero-interest bonds will have a face value of $525,000 per bond. Metaplanet acknowledged in its notice of issuance that it may redeem a corresponding multiple of Bonds at $1 per $1 of face value if it contributes enough money in future fundraisings. Metaplanet continues its Bitcoin purchases *Metaplanet Issues 21 Million USD in 0% Ordinary Bonds to Purchase Additional $BTC * pic.twitter.com/uQKEQSBN9S — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) May 29, 2025 Metaplanet is adding more Bitcoin with zero-interest bonds, continuing its string of debt-funded buys as it nears the 10,000 BTC goal by the end of 2025. The company issued its latest $21 million bonds on May 29, which it revealed will be repaid on November 28. The bonds are similar to obtaining a loan but with zero interest, meaning Metaplanet receives funds at no added cost until maturity. Metaplanet noted that the bond deal includes flexible repayment terms. One term is that EVO FUND can request its money back early, provided the investor receives at least five business days’ notice, providing an exit option if needed. The firm has raised capital through several bond issuances this year, including $25.9 million in February, $13.3 million in late March, and $25 million earlier this month. Its latest issuance follows another notice just a day earlier for a separate amount of $50 million. The company said in its May 28 announcement it’s raising $50M through bonds, which will be issued in $1.25 million denominations and will carry on interest. The investment firm noted that investors will not receive regular payments, with any potential profit expected to come from the bonds’ redemption value. The Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed company’s total debt raised this year has reached roughly $135.2 million. Metaplanet acquired another 696 BTC in late March through a combination of exercised cash-secured put options and premiums from selling those options. The firm said it acquired the coins as part of its Bitcoin Income Generation strategy, which involves selling put options and using the collateral to purchase Bitcoin at an effective discount. Metaplanet’s strategy generated $5.1 million in premiums in Q1 2025 alone, an 11.4% increase from the previous quarter. The strategy also helped the company to acquire Bitcoin at an effective price of just $88,800 per coin, below market rates at the time of execution. Metaplanet also appointed President Trump’s son, Eric Trump, to its Strategic Advisory Board in the same month. The firm expects Eric to bring his experience in real estate, finance, and brand development to assist its drive in Bitcoin adoption. At the time of publication, data showed that the company now ranks as the 11th biggest corporate holder of Bitcoin. The data also revealed that Metaplanet currently holds 7,800 Bitcoin, which accounts for 78% of its goal. The Japanese investment firm’s record holdings are currently worth approximately $841.85 million, purchased at an average price of $91,340 per BTC. At the time of publication, Bitcoin was exchanging hands at around $108,000, a 13.89% increase from the last month. Metaplanet plans to establish a U.S. subsidiary Metaplanet announced on May 1 plans to launch a wholly owned subsidiary in Florida. The company acknowledged that it aims to raise $250 million for its new subsidiary. “With planned capital of up to $250 million, this move will accelerate its Bitcoin treasury strategy and serve as a crucial step in expanding access to liquidity for institutional investors in one of the world’s leading capital markets.” – Simon Gerovich , CEO of Metaplanet. The Japanese investment firm said it will operate its new entity as Metaplanet Treasury Corp. to expand its access to U.S. institutional investors and bolster 24-hour operations across time zones. Gerovich noted that the company chose Florida because it is rapidly emerging as a global hub for Bitcoin innovation, corporate adoption, and financial liberation. The investment company believes the move will strengthen its continuous operational capabilities and solidify its position in the U.S. market.

2025-05-29T09:01:05.000Z,"Cardano News: Can These 2 Factors Fuel a $10 ADA?","TL;DR After sitting on the sidelines for a few weeks, Cardano whales have gone on an accumulation spree, purchasing over 180,000,000 ADA within the past seven-day period. The team behind the layer-1 blockchain announced a big integration yesterday of Bitcoin Ordinals, which, according to analysts, could also fuel a substantial price reversal. Whales Start Buying Again As the largest market participants, especially for cryptocurrencies that lack ETFs or other funds allowing institutional exposure through regulated financial vehicles, whales’ actions are particularly significant for altcoins’ price movements. ADA’s price is also highly susceptible to whether they buy or sell in massive quantities, as evident in late February when they were disposing of their assets, and the asset plunged. However, data shared by Ali Martinez showcases a more promising current picture as they have accumulated over 180,000,000 ADA in the past week alone. In terms of USD value, this stash is equivalent to $135 million at today’s prices. The picture below indicates that whales’ holdings have surpassed 13 billion ADA, which is more than a third of the entire available token supply (35.33 billion, according to CoinMarketCap).

IOG announced such a big move yesterday, as Bitcoin Ordinals can now be wrapped and bridged to the Cardano blockchain via Fairgate’s BitVMX framework. According to the statement, this marks a “significant advancement in decentralized finance, enabling seamless interaction between two of the most prominent blockchain systems.” “The future of DeFi is cross-chain, and BitVMX exemplifies how Bitcoin can be a foundational layer in this evolution,” said Charles Hoskinson, CEO of IO. “By combining Cardano’s flexibility with Bitcoin’s security, we open the door to entirely new financial instruments and services.” Dan Gambardello, a popular YouTuber and X content creator, praised the move and highlighted that it is a part of the ingredients for a potential ADA price surge to $10.

Speaking on Wednesday at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, he said that New York is the Empire State and “we build empires. Come back home,” he called crypto businesses, encouraging to come back to the city. “It’s time for the first time in the history of the city to have a financial instrument that is made for those who are holders of Bitcoin,” he addressed the gathering. “I believe we need to have a BitBond, and I am going to push and fight to get a BitBond in New York, so you can do safe bond investments in NYC.” BREAKING: NYC MAYOR ERIC ADAMS JUST ANNOUNCED HE'S GOING \""TO FIGHT TO GET A BITBOND IN NEW YORK\"" THIS IS MASSIVE pic.twitter.com/8Ix0spHEOf — The Bitcoin Conference (@TheBitcoinConf) May 28, 2025 “Let’s eliminate the BitLicense”: Mayor The New York BitLicense, a regulatory framework for crypto firms in the city, has faced significant criticism from the community. Critics have urged the state to get rid of BitLicense “right away,” to “create opportunities for growth and innovation.” Some argue that its strict requirements could stifle innovation or drive companies out of New York. The Office of the New York Comptroller, Thomas DiNapoli, has also previously raised his voice against the management of the BitLicense scheme. “Come back home, you have a mayor that is the crypto mayor, is the Bitcoin mayor, and I want you back in the city of New York,” Adam stated. “Where you won’t be attacked and criminalized. Let’s get rid of the Bitcoin license and allow us to free flow of Bitcoin in our city.” NYC to Use Bitcoin Blockchain for Birth Certificates On a concluding note, the mayor said that New York would use Bitcoin and blockchain for birth certificates. “We are going to use Bitcoin to pay off fines and taxes. We are going to allow our young people to understand what it is to be part of this industry, but we need you on the ground,” he added. “The message is clear: get out there and show your power.

2025-05-29T09:00:47.000Z,"Ethereum Holds 200-Day EMA – Is A Breakout To $3,300 Imminent?","As Ethereum (ETH) continues to trade in the mid-$2,000 range, signs are emerging that the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap may be getting ready for its next leg up. The digital asset appears poised to break out of a bull flag formation, with $3,300 as a potential target . Ethereum Looks Poised For A Breakout According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor ibrahimcosar, the daily ETH chart indicates a breakout from a bull flag formation. The analyst shared the following chart to illustrate ETH’s next possible move. For the uninitiated, A bull flag pattern is a bullish continuation pattern that forms after a strong upward price movement – the flagpole – followed by a period of consolidation within parallel lines – the flag. It typically signals that the asset may break out upward and continue its prior uptrend. Notably, ETH has been consolidating between $2,400 and $2,700 for the past 17 days. This consolidation – combined with the prior upward momentum – has formed a classic bull flag pattern on the daily chart. In addition, ETH has remained above the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) during this same period. The analyst emphasized the bullish implications of this technical signal, stating: Staying above the 200-day EMA is a bullish signal, and it’s highly likely that in the next strong move, we could see ETH in the $3000–$3500 range. This is the kind of clear bullish signal we’ve seen before major rallies in the past. Further, ibrahimcosar noted that Ethereum’s movement often serves as a bellwether for the altcoin market. Historically, when ETH rallies, other altcoins tend to follow suit. A breakout in ETH could thus trigger broader gains across the crypto market. Meanwhile, noted crypto analyst Titan of Crypto shared the following weekly chart illustrating potential ETH price targets if it sustains its current bullish trajectory. The chart shows ETH hitting as high as $8,500 by the beginning of 2026. What Are ETH Whales Anticipating? In a separate post on X, crypto analyst Ali Martinez observed that Ethereum whales – wallets holding 10,000 to 100,000 ETH – have accumulated over 1 million ETH in the past month. Similarly, Web3 growth manager Cas Abbe recently remarked that ETH is starting to show signs of life once again. The executive predicted that ETH may reach $4,000 by Q3 2025. That said, hurdles remain. Blockchain analytics firm Glassnode recently stated that once ETH reaches $2,800, it may witness strong selling pressure which can derail its bullish momentum. At press time, ETH trades at $2,620, down 1% in the past 24 hours.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-holds-200-day-ema-is-a-breakout-to-3300-imminent/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Ethereum|Altcoin|altseason|bullish flag|crypto|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|ETH|Ether|ETHUSDT|Technical Analysis",cryptocompare

With a highly leveraged Bitcoin (BTC) long position hanging in the balance, Wynn’s destiny could be decided with his next trade. From Meme Coins to Million-Dollar Trades Wynn is well-known for his bold trading style, frequently placing large bets on meme and relatively lesser-known tokens. According to data from EmberCN, in mid-May he placed a tight trade on Trump (TRUMP) and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) and gained $11.67 million from May 12–13. The hot streak didn’t last long, though. On May 23, Wynn’s long ETH and Sui (SUI) positions turned against him and lost him $5.29 million. Then, an epic comeback. On May 24, Wynn recorded a whopping $42.08 million profit on longs for Bitcoin and PEPE. The profits did not hold, though. Between May 25–27, his BTC short and PEPE long combination failed, burning $16.72 million. $200M Bitcoin Bet on the Brink Wynn is now long 1,840 BTC at a notional value of approximately $200.3 million, with 40x leverage. His entry was $109,228, and his liquidation price is $102,257—just 6% below the current BTC price of $108,874. The trade is already showing an unrealized loss of $718,098. A further drop in BTC would not just wipe out recent profits, but also principal capital Wynn has put into this trade. Defiant in the Face of Danger Despite looming losses, Wynn has not lost his swagger. In a biting tweet to naysayers, he tweeted: “For all my haters out there who so very much enjoyed watching my portfolio swing down by $60,000,000… just know, now you get to watch it swing BACK UP INTO THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS…” Wynn appears unfazed, even energized by the high-risk world he inhabits. Whale Wallet Suggests Strategic Change On-chain analytics software The Data Nerd has linked Wynn to a whale wallet which recently moved 44.337 billion PEPE tokens, valued at $6.17 million, to Binance. Acquired at a micro-entry point, the position was reported to have returned 11,117x. The move may indicate Wynn is preparing to rotate funds or hedge further losses, utilizing the massive profit from his PEPE position. Will the Gamble Pay Off? Wynn’s risky approach has earned him wealth as well as derision. With liquidation staring in the face now, the crypto world is watching with bated breath. Whether he manages another unlikely turnaround or faces a catastrophic blowup remains to be witnessed.",btcpulse,https://btc-pulse.com/james-wynns-high-stakes-crypto-gamble-nears/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|TRADING|ZRX|PEPE","Blockchain|Bitcoin|Regulation",cryptocompare

2025-05-29T08:40:22.000Z,"Trump family pushes crypto agenda from every angle","Donald Trump is pushing every chip forward, tying his entire family’s wealth to Bitcoin while sitting in the White House during his second term. The US president, according to Bloomberg, is worth $5.2 billion, and now a massive chunk of that is about to rise or crash with the price of crypto. The gamble is being executed through Trump Media and Technology Group, a company that’s been losing money for years and just revealed a new plan to raise $2.5 billion to buy Bitcoin. The company reported on Tuesday that it will sell $1.5 billion worth of stock and issue another $1 billion in convertible bonds to fund the purchase. Its latest filing showed the company held just $759 million in cash and investments as of Q1, making the raise necessary to cover the full cost. Cantor Fitzgerald is advising on the deal, which is expected to close by May 29. Devin Nunes, the CEO of Trump Media, described Bitcoin as “ the apex instrument of financial freedom ,” confirming that the purchase will be central to the company’s new direction. Trump family pushes crypto agenda from every angle Trump has appointed regulators favorable to the industry, built a national crypto reserve, ended federal prosecutions of crypto firms, and even issued presidential pardons for industry figures. But this week, that policy support became personal. Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. have been actively promoting crypto across the globe, appearing at conferences in Abu Dhabi, Washington, and Dubai over the last few months. This week, they’re scheduled to appear again, this time in Las Vegas, alongside Vice President JD Vance. Their attendance at these events is drawing criticism over conflicts of interest, especially as the financial health of their family’s businesses now depends heavily on Bitcoin’s price. At the same time, Trump Media’s core product, Truth Social, is bleeding cash. The company brought in only $820,000 in revenue last quarter and lost $38 million. In 2024, it reported a net loss of $401 million. Yet despite these figures, Trump continues to hold onto a major stake. Through a trust overseen by Donald Jr., Trump owns $2.6 billion worth of shares in the company. The pivot to Bitcoin mirrors a broader trend. According to CoinGecko, over 30 US companies now hold Bitcoin in their corporate treasuries, and analysts at Bernstein say the asset could attract $330 billion in institutional capital by 2030. Trump Media’s is just the loudest. Crypto deals multiply across Trump-linked businesses Just hours after Trump Media’s announcement, other companies tied to Trump-world joined the action. PSQ Holdings, where Donald Jr. is a board member, said it would begin to “ explore ” holding crypto as part of its assets. Strive Asset Management, co-founded by Vivek Ramaswamy, launched a $750 million Bitcoin fund that same day. All of it points to a coordinated push across Trump’s business network to buy into the crypto boom. In the government itself, allies are also moving. Cantor Equity Partners, a SPAC run by Brandon Lutnick, the son of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, is working with Tether and Softbank Group to launch a new venture called Twenty One Capital with the aim of building a Bitcoin stockpile. Trump’s connections don’t stop there. Major holders like Michael Saylor’s Strategy and Elon Musk’s Tesla are already heavily invested in Bitcoin. Metaplanet, a Tokyo-based firm where Eric is now listed as an adviser, has also been aggressively adding crypto to its portfolio. And Hut 8, now a majority stakeholder in a new mining company backed by Trump’s family, is the latest to step into the space. Bitcoin’s price has responded to all the attention. It surged past $112,000 last week, setting a new record. Since Trump won reelection in November, Bitcoin is up 55%. But while Bitcoin’s value surged, Trump Media shares dropped by 34%, proving just how unstable the company remains even as it gets into crypto.

The Plomin Hard Fork, which activated in Q1 2025, has significantly enhanced Cardano’s appeal to investors by establishing full decentralized governance. This is seen as a key milestone that aligns with the blockchain’s long-term vision of community-driven decision-making. Despite these advancements, bullish attraction post-Plomin Hard Fork was tempered by market dynamics and challenges, on its price chart.

Table of Contents Coinpedia’s Cardano Price Prediction 2025 Cardano Price Today Cardano Price Prediction for May 2025 ADA Price Prediction 2025 Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 ADA Price Prediction 2026 Cardano Price Targets 2027 ADA Price Forecast 2028 ADA Price Analysis 2029 Cardano Price Prediction 2030 Cardano Price Prediction 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Market Analysis FAQs Cardano Price Today Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $ 0.75219197 0.08% Market Cap $ 26,578,337,892.2125 Trading Volume $ 682,643,477.8832 Circulating Supply 35,334,514,487.4673 All-time High $3.10 on 02nd Sept 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on 02nd Oct 2017 Cardano Price Prediction for May 2025 The ADA price last parabolic shift was seen during Q4 2024, it leaped to $1.32 high, but increased bearish pressure pushed its price action into a declining wedge. In April of Q2 2025, the bear tried its best to break the support zone near $0.6, but the bullish forces gave the supporting shoulder to the falling ADA price. With bullish forces, it came right back above the high volume profile level, and made higher-highs and higher-lows till it reached $0.85 by mid-May. However, despite being above the 20-day EMA band and the 50-day EMA band, its price action is consolidating and RSI is at the median line, which shows that investors lack the bullish conviction. Also inside that channel ADA risks triangle breakdown amid a bearish pressure surge. For a conclusive breakdown, the price must close below the 50-day EMA at $0.7347, which could extend the decline to $0.60 and $0.40. In case of a bullish momentum revitalizes, then with a closing above the $0.85 resistance level, which is its previous swing high resistance that also aligns with the falling channel’s upper border resistance. Once it clears that hurdle, then it might retest the supply level at $1.10 by May or June 2025, which is a long-standing resistance level since mid-December 2024. Also, the Cardano liquidation map over 7 days shows the strength of bearish positions increasing. The cumulative short leverage positions (marked with green color) are indicative of bears’ tremendous interest in pushing the ADA price down in the short term. In addition, one of the clearest signs that there could be trouble ahead for ADA is the presence of declining funding rates. This could lead to continued price consolidation or a possible decline soon, it is clear that in short term the market lacks a clear catalyst for a breakout. ADA Price Prediction 2025 Source: coincarp Cardano has always prioritized decentralization, and the recent Plomin hard fork has taken it a step further. Unlike many other blockchains, Cardano gives more control to its users than to any central organization. This is reflected in CoinCarp’s rich list, where the top 100 addresses hold just 22% of the mainnet’s circulating supply, significantly lower than most other altcoins. To push ADA’s price beyond the $1.10 to $1.20 range, strong retail participation will be necessary. A potential catalyst for this could be the approval of an ADA ETF , which experts believe could launch by the end of this year and attract billions in inflows.If ADA manages to sustain levels above its Q1 2025 high , there’s a solid chance it could retest the $2.05 mark by year-end.

2025-05-29T08:36:09.000Z,"U.S. Trade Court Ruling Sends 30-Year Treasury Yield Above 5%","U.S. Treasury yields are climbing swiftly, with the 30-year yield rising back above 5% and the 10-year jumping to 4.50% after the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled President Donald Trump's key tariff measures illegal . The court said Congress had exclusive authority to regulate trade with other countries, and the president exceeded his authority by invoking emergency economic powers not intended for imposing broad trade levies, according to news service reports. While Wednesday's ruling nullifies the general 10% and reciprocal duties, it does not affect sector-specific tariffs like those on steel or autos. The administration said it plans to appeal the ruling. Over the past two sessions, the 10-year yield has rise from 4.40%, underscoring how sensitive the bond market remains to policy shifts and geopolitical developments. Despite the ruling, macro uncertainty continues to loom large. As the Kobeissi Letter points out, tensions between the U.S. and China are far from easing. The U.S. has ordered domestic chip designers to halt sales to China, paused exports of critical chip software and jet-engine technologies, and announced plans to begin revoking visas of Chinese students in a signal of a renewed push toward decoupling. The Dollar Index (DXY), a measure of the U.S. currency's value against a basket of trade partners, has responded in kind, climbing to 100 from 98 as investors flock to the dollar amid global uncertainty and rising yields. Meanwhile, both bitcoin BTC and gold remain in a holding pattern, suggesting markets are bracing for the next major policy move or geopolitical surprise.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/29/us-trade-court-ruling-sends-30-year-treasury-yield-above-5,"ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION","Markets|tariff|China|Treasury|News",cryptocompare
2025-05-29T08:26:22.000Z,"Older Bitcoin Holders Are Spending Their BTC Again: Profit-taking or Strategic Reallocation?","As bitcoin cools off from the latest rally, BTC sitting in wallets belonging to long-term holders has begun to move again. This raises the question of whether these moves are profit-taking by this investor cohort or merely strategic reallocation for further price appreciation. Data from the market research and intelligence firm Glassnode shows that the rise in spending has driven the aggregate volume from the one-year to 5-year cohorts to $4.02 billion. This is the highest level since February. Bitcoin OGs Are Spending Again According to Glassnode, this is the fifth-largest one-year to five-year spending spike of this bull cycle. This surge is driven by older Bitcoin holders – investors who have held their coins for three to five years. Since the beginning of this bull run, older Bitcoin holders have recorded massive volumes after each BTC rally. The investors have spent significant amounts of BTC in March, October, November 2024, and February 2025. The largest spending so far this cycle occurred in October 2024, with $9.25 billion led by the one- to two-year cohort. The second and third largest were in March 2024 and February 2025, $6.11 billion and $5.42 billion, respectively, led by the two-year to three-year cohort. The fourth-largest was recorded in November 2024, $4.39 billion, driven by the three-year to five-year cohort. The three-year to five-year Bitcoin holder cohort is once again leading the latest spending spike with $2.16 billion. Glassnode noted that this is their second-largest outflow of the cycle, following an approximately $6 billion outflow in March 2024. On the other hand, the two-year to three-year and one-year to two-year cohorts have spent about $1.41 billion and $450 million, respectively, this time. Consolidation or Deeper Correction? Although it remains unclear whether OG wallets are waking up to collect profits or reallocate their holdings, BTC has been in a correction mode over the last six days. The cryptocurrency has slipped more than 4% from its recent all-time high of $111,970, according to data from CoinMarketCap. At the time of writing, BTC was worth around $107,540, with a 3% weekly decline and a 1.2% 24-hour drop. If reallocation is the goal of older Bitcoin holders, then BTC may consolidate some more in the coming days. However, if they are taking profits, then the asset could record a deeper correction, possibly slipping below $106,000.

According to its recent press release , Antalpha aims to diversify its holdings in the face of macroeconomic volatility by investing in Tether ( USDT )’s digital gold token, XAUt ( XAUT ). The platform chose the token because of its gold-backed value that is believed to be suitable for institutional asset allocation, particularly its ability to withstand crypto market cycles and support different financial applications. Therefore, the company plans to allocate as much as $40 million from its portfolio into XAUt by June 30, 2026. The Tether-issued token is poised to be the Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining platform’s “cornerstone collateral asset” within its loan structure. As part of its ongoing investment strategy, Antalpha plans to acquire more digital assets like XAUt in the long run to obtain funding for its lending operations.

In 2022, Litecoin experienced significant losses, dropping below $45 mid-year. However, it managed to outperform the broader market despite a nearly 55% decline overall. 2023 saw high volatility for Litecoin, peaking at $114.50 in July but declining sharply due to market pressures, ending the year at $72.80 with a modest 7% rise despite underperforming the broader market. In 2024, Litecoin started the year around $68.20, climbed to $102.40 in April, and then fell below $80. After further declines in May and June, it dropped to $49 in August before rebounding to $70.

2025-05-29T08:14:57.000Z,"Russia now allows banks to offer crypto-linked products to qualified investors","The Bank of Russia is finally letting crypto through the door, but only for people who meet a very high bar. On Wednesday, the central bank said financial institutions in Russia can now offer their wealthiest and most experienced clients access to crypto-linked investments. This decision, according to a press release from the Bank of Russia, allows licensed firms to provide non-deliverable products—things like derivatives and securities—whose returns depend on crypto prices. But investors won’t actually receive any crypto. The whole system has been built to keep coins out of clients’ hands. This isn’t open season for crypto in Russia though. The central bank made it clear that only qualified investors will be allowed to touch these products. Every bank offering them has to apply strict risk controls, fully cover these investments with capital, and set individual limits on exposure. The Bank said it plans to formalize this conservative approach later in the year, building a regulatory framework around the price volatility of crypto. At the same time, it warned both institutions and their clients to stay away from direct crypto purchases, repeating its long-standing position against retail trading. Government considers crypto sandbox, Sberbank joins regulated exchanges The Russian government is currently reviewing a proposal from the Bank of Russia to create a testing zone for actual crypto transactions. The idea is to launch a special regime where only certain investors will be allowed to buy or sell crypto directly. That plan was introduced in March, and if approved, will run for three years under a system called the EPR, or experimental legal regime. Elvira Nabiullina, Governor of the Bank of Russia, told the Russian Stock Market 2025 conference on May 16 that the crypto market needs both new laws and stronger infrastructure before it can grow in Russia. She said the EPR would only be open to investors who pass strict qualifications. According to the plan, anyone who wants to join the sandbox must hold more than 100 million rubles in securities and deposits or make at least 50 million rubles per year. Nabiullina also said discussions are ongoing about how to finalize those rules, and the government is expected to help speed that process. While the Bank works on tightening the rules, Russia’s biggest lender is already preparing to step in. Alexander Zozulya, head of global markets at Sberbank, said the bank plans to act as a liquidity provider for the country’s regulated crypto platforms. These platforms are being designed exclusively for highly vetted investors, not for the public. “We will serve as a market maker on these regulated exchanges,” Zozulya said, adding that the goal is to bring structure and reliability to crypto trading within approved limits. Trump fuels Russian crypto surge, oil companies use bitcoin in trade The Bank of Russia also pointed to a massive surge in crypto activity coming from inside the country. Over the last quarter of 2024 and the first three months of 2025, crypto flows tied to Russian residents increased by over 51% compared to the previous six months. The Bank reported that Russians moved 7.3 trillion rubles, or around $91 billion, through major global crypto exchanges during that time. The Bank said that President Donald Trump’s administration is boosting international confidence in crypto, which is helping attract Russian interest. Trump’s support for Bitcoin has had an effect across global markets, with Russia being one of the countries responding fastest. Crypto is also now part of Russia’s foreign trade strategy. Many Russian oil companies have started using bitcoin, ether, and stablecoins like Tether to deal with China and India. These tokens help them convert yuan and rupees into rubles, especially in deals that bypass Western banking systems. Though still small, this crypto-based method is growing as part of Russia’s $192 billion oil trade, according to the International Energy Agency. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The move comes at a time when several countries, including the U.S., European Union, Japan, and the UK, have placed strict sanctions on Russia , many of them targeting digital assets and crypto usage. So, what exactly does this mean for the market and investors? Russia Allows Crypto-Linked Products In a statement released this week , the Bank of Russia confirmed that financial institutions are now allowed to offer products that are linked to cryptocurrency prices. These include derivatives, securities, and digital financial assets. But there’s a catch, these products cannot be settled in actual crypto. In short, investors won’t be receiving Bitcoin or Ethereum but only products tied to their price movements. And these products won’t be for everyone. Only “qualified investors,” a restricted group with the required experience and financial background, will be able to trade them. The Bank of Russia has announced it will allow financial institutions to offer crypto-linked derivatives, securities, and digital financial assets to qualified investors. These must be non-deliverable products, meaning investors won't directly receive crypto.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 29, 2025 Strict Controls and Risk Warnings Even with this new step, the Russian central bank isn’t diving into crypto without a safety net. It told banks and other credit institutions to be extremely careful with these products. They must fully back these instruments with capital and also set limits to avoid big risks. Over the coming year, the Bank of Russia also plans to formalize rules that would better manage risks tied to the volatile nature of cryptocurrency prices. Global Pressure Through Sanctions Many countries have already cracked down on Russia’s use of digital assets. After the Ukraine conflict, the U.S., EU, Japan, and the UK imposed sanctions that also covered crypto to prevent Russia from using it as a loophole to move money. Because of this, Russia has been trying to find new ways to explore the digital finance world without breaking global rules. Russia BTC Holding Even though crypto rules in Russia aren’t very clear, the country has a lot of Bitcoin. The Central Bank of Russia and some government offices have gotten bitcoin either by buying it directly or by seizing it from criminal activities.

2025-05-29T08:05:54.000Z,"Bitcoin Whales Seem to Be Calling a Top as BTC Price Consolidates","Bitcoin BTC is currently consolidating between $107,000 and $109,000, remaining just a few percentage points shy of its all-time high. While this tight range may appear stable on the surface, on-chain data suggests a shift in sentiment among some of the market's most influential participants, the large holders known as whales. Glassnode’s Accumulation Trend Score , a measure of accumulation behavior across various wallet-size cohorts, offers deeper insight into this evolving market dynamic. The metric evaluates the strength of purchasing by combining the size of wallet entities with the volume of bitcoin acquired over the past 15 days. For the largest holders, the value has dropped to 0.4. A reading closer to 1 indicates strong buying, whereas a level near 0 points to sales. Crucially, wallets associated with exchanges and miners are excluded from this analysis to provide a clearer picture of investor behavior. What stands out is that entities holding 10,000 BTC or more typically classified as whales were the first to begin accumulating at the market’s April lows at around $75,000. Now, they are starting to reduce their holdings while the other wallet cohorts remain in accumulation mode. This pivot suggests a strategic shift, potentially driven by a desire to lock in profits near historic highs or a more cautious outlook on short-term price direction. Supporting evidence for this shift in behavior comes from exchange-flow data that shows whale wallets had been steadily withdrawing bitcoin over the past month, a bullish signal that implies they were not looking to sell their holdings in the short term. This trend now appears to be reversing. In two of the past three days, whales have deposited BTC back onto exchanges, a pattern commonly associated with imminent selling activity. This nuanced behavior raises the critical question: Are whales anticipating a local top?",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/29/bitcoin-whales-seem-to-be-calling-a-top-as-btc-price-consolidates,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Whale|News",cryptocompare

The posted addresses follow a recent refusal by Michael Saylor to reveal an on-chain proof of the company’s holdings. Arkham Intelligence has posted multiple wallets reportedly belonging to Strategy (MSTR). Previously, Arkham shared smaller holdings, but recently increased its efforts to track down the real on-chain portfolio of Strategy. Arkham revealed 87.5% of Strategy’s BTC holdings, including some real-time purchase transactions. | Source: Arkham Intelligence The disclosures by Arkham of the public blockchain were seen as pressure for transparency. Even Michael Saylor stated he preferred the addresses to remain confidential. There is still no consensus on the need for on-chain transparency. Security threats include dust addresses, which rely on a human mistake to transfer funds to the attacker’s wallet. Public addresses also invite transfers from small-scale projects, including prank NFT transactions . However, other BTC holdings have been transparent for years with no problems, especially the widely watched WBTC treasury. The interactions and purchase style of Strategy may also be watched and affect the market, further swaying BTC prices. Dusting wallets may also link them to mixers or exploit addresses, making it more complex for the company to prove compliance. In general, crypto transactions are still unregulated, but there are attempts to declare the origin of coins and link them to identities where possible. Strategy also relies on the announcement effect, after buying BTC at market prices, but without disclosing each purchase. The ability of anyone to notice and track the purchases in real time may erase that effect for BTC and the MSTR stock price. Strategy has also mostly accumulated BTC with no signs of selling, which could be seen as a vote of no-confidence for the leading coin. Arkham’s research reveals no purchases for days Arkham Intelligence announced all addresses hold over 454.23 BTC. The latest purchase was from five days ago, originating from Coinbase Prime. The purchases may yet be completed through other wallets, as Arkham has not exhausted the search. New wallets can also be generated, or other forms of custody. Holding BTC in third-party custody is also seen as a potential risk, as the coins are exposed to the exchange or service levels of security. Reportedly, Strategy uses mostly Coinbase Prime and Fidelity for its holdings. The Coinbase Prime funds can be segregated, but Fidelity mixes all coins and the exact share of Strategy remains uncertain. Based on Arkham’s report, Strategy holds over 327K BTC with Coinbase Prime, with up to 107K held in Fidelity wallets. On the other hand, Metaplanet has been entirely transparent with its holdings of 7,800 BTC. The Japanese company uses a self-custodial wallet to withdraw from exchanges. Other treasury holders also have known on-chain presence, with inflows from mining also reflected in their balances. Most corporate and other large-scale treasuries remain transparent, currently holding 3.37M BTC. The holdings are seen as a signal for long-term confidence and the use case of BTC as a reserve asset, especially after the addresses remain dormant with no selling. Despite the data of slower purchases, Strategy marked the success of its STRK preferred shares. The asset climbed continuously to over $102, trading at a six-month peak. MSTR common shares fell toward $364.52, as BTC moved down from its peak to the $107,000 range. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

2025-05-29T08:00:05.000Z,"Bitcoin $106,800 Support Retest To Determine Next Move – Breakout Or Breakdown Ahead?","Amid the market’s momentary pause, Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a 2% price drop in the past 24 hours. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been hovering between key resistance and support levels, with some analysts suggesting that volatility could be in BTC’s short-term future. Related Reading: Ethereum Ready For $3,000 Breakout? Analysts Say Sideways Action Is About To End Bitcoin Price Consolidates Near ATH On Wednesday, Bitcoin, alongside the rest of the crypto market, saw a small retrace ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) release of the May 6 and 7 Meeting Minutes. The flagship cryptocurrency dropped 2.7% from the $110,000 Daily Opening to a multi-day low of $107,107, suggesting a cautious approach from investors. Notably, Bitcoin has seen a significant 15% rally over the past month, hitting a new all-time high (ATH) of $111,953 nearly a week ago, and recovering around 50% from April lows. Since reaching its new ATH, Bitcoin has moved sideways, trading between the $106,800-$109,700 levels. Despite the small retracement, analyst Crypto Jelle considers that Bitcoin’s trend into price discovery remains “intact,” pointing out that price has been consolidating above the previous highs. Per the chart, the cryptocurrency is currently forming a symmetrical triangle pattern in the lower timeframes, with the upper boundary sitting between the $109,00-$110,000 mark. To Jelle, the cryptocurrency is “building pressure for the next leg higher,” with a breakout propelling the cryptocurrency to another 30% rally. The analyst previously highlighted a Power of 3 (Po3) formation in BTC’s chart, suggesting that its price expansion targets the $140,000-$150,000 level after reclaiming the new ATH resistance. Ali Martinez stated that BTC remains “range-bound” despite today’s price drop, but added that the range’s low is the key level to watch. He warned that a breakdown below the $106,800 support could trigger increased volatility, which might send BTC’s price to lower levels. BTC Retest To Trigger Volatility? Titan of Crypto also affirmed that Bitcoin currently sits at a key level. According to the market watcher’s analysis, BTC is “still hovering around the daily Tenkan,” which is the level to watch during the potential volatility from the FOMC Minutes. A breakdown from this support zone could send the cryptocurrency’s price to the next key support at around the $102,700 mark. On the contrary, holding the current levels could set the stage for a new retest of the range’s upper boundary. Meanwhile, Daan Crypto Trades noted that as Bitcoin consolidates near ATHs, BTC-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen significant inflows over the past few weeks, recording their second-best performance last week. As he explained, one of the cycle’s better “indicators” to determine strength or weakness at local tops or bottoms has been the ETF flows, detailing that, generally, big inflows after a big run, while BTC’s price doesn’t continue its rally, have suggested a local top. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) To Continue Price Discovery Rally If It Holds These Levels – Analyst To the trader, “it is important for the bulls to get that move going quickly because getting billions of inflows without proper price progress isn’t generally the best,” adding that “for the effort that’s put in and an ATH break, you’d want to see more.” Daan considers that if the massive inflows stop and BTC’s price holds, then its short-term performance will likely continue. However, if price doesn’t hold its current range, “we might need to see a bit of a flush & panic first before the proper breakout move.” As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $107,700, a 1.6% decrease in the weekly chart.

2025-05-29T07:51:57.000Z,"Norway’s K33 Raises $6.2M to Join Wave of Public Bitcoin Buyers","Key Takeaways: K33 raised $6.2 million through zero-interest loans and equity to fund Bitcoin purchases. The firm plans to use the BTC reserve to launch new financial products in the Nordic market. K33 joins a global trend of public companies turning to Bitcoin as a strategic treasury asset. Norwegian crypto brokerage K33 is the latest firm to embrace Bitcoin as a treasury asset, raising 60 million Swedish krona ($6.2 million) to fund its entry into the growing circle of publicly-backed BTC holders. The Oslo-based company announced on May 28 that it secured the funding through a combination of convertible loans and a new share-and-warrant issuance. The entire amount will be used to purchase Bitcoin as part of K33’s newly launched Bitcoin Treasury Strategy. K33 Secures $6.2M in Zero-Interest Loans and Equity to Fund Bitcoin Push The financing includes 45 million SEK ($4.6 million) in zero-interest convertible loans maturing in June 2028, and an additional 15 million SEK ($1.5 million) raised through equity instruments. Investors who convert their warrants before March 2026 will receive bonus warrants, potentially increasing K33’s raise to 75 million SEK ($7.7 million). CEO Bull Jenssen, writing on X, described Bitcoin as the “best-performing asset in the coming decade,” and confirmed that the company intends to “accumulate as many as possible.” He positioned the move as a proactive step, saying: “Why wait for the government to build a Bitcoin reserve when you can build your own?” At Bitcoin’s current price of around $108,000, the firm could buy approximately 57 BTC. Beyond holding, K33 plans to leverage its Bitcoin reserve to launch BTC-backed financial products, including lending services, particularly within the Nordic market. In its Q1 interim report released the same day, Jenssen emphasized the strategic value of Bitcoin beyond its potential returns. “With a sizable BTC reserve, we will be able to strengthen our financial position while unlocking new revenue streams, product capabilities, and partnerships,” he wrote. PRESS RELEASE: K33 secures financing of SEK 60 million to buy bitcoin and launch its Bitcoin Treasury Strategy. Read the press release here: https://t.co/zRPFCWag5P pic.twitter.com/qAha0lpKnt — K33 (@K33HQ) May 28, 2025 K33 joins a growing list of firms turning to Bitcoin as a treasury asset. GameStop and France’s Blockchain Group are recent examples, the latter saw its stock skyrocket over 200% in a single day following its BTC pivot in November 2024. However, K33’s own stock showed a more muted response, closing down nearly 2% on the day of the announcement. Market watchers will now be observing whether the Bitcoin bet translates into longer-term gains, both for the firm’s balance sheet and its share price. Crypto Firms Tap Capital Markets to Fuel Bitcoin Buying Spree Digital asset companies are flooding capital markets to raise funds for large-scale Bitcoin acquisitions , spurred by the cryptocurrency’s rally to a record $111,965 last week. The surge, up more than 50% from early April, has ignited a wave of listings and mergers as firms race to secure funding while investor appetite remains strong. This week, Trump Media & Technology Group confirmed plans to raise $2.5 billion to buy crypto, joining a growing list of firms mimicking MicroStrategy’s blueprint. Just recently, French crypto holding company Blockchain Group announced plans to purchase an additional $72 million worth of Bitcoin following a successful €63.3 million bond sale, as it expands its aggressive treasury strategy.

2025-05-29T07:49:03.000Z,"Top Bitcoin Price Predictions from Bitcoin Conference 2025: Experts Forecast $170K to $13M","The post Top Bitcoin Price Predictions from Bitcoin Conference 2025: Experts Forecast $170K to $13M appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas has just concluded. The event witnessed numerous spectacular speeches, as several prominent figures, including JD Vance (the US Vice President), Michael Saylor (the Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy), Vlad Tenev (the Chairman and CEO of Robinhood), Adam Back (the CEO of Blockstream), and Paolo Ardoino (the CEO of Tether) participated in it. Historically, major Bitcoin conferences, especially those featuring high-profile speeches, can sometimes lead to increased volatility in the Bitcoin price. In the last seven days, the BTC price has experienced a drop of 3.4%. In the last 24 hours alone, the price has declined by approximately 1.2%. Experts say this price movement may reflect both post-event market corrections and ongoing macroeconomic concerns. For investors, it underscores the importance of approaching bullish predictions with caution, while still recognizing Bitcoin’s long-term potential . Interestingly, during the event, some speakers made exciting predictions about the future prospects of Bitcoin. These predictions not only demonstrate optimism but also reflect emerging shifts in how Bitcoin is being perceived at institutional and governmental levels. Here are some of those striking predictions, along with insights into their broader implications: Top Bitcoin Market Forecasters at Bitcoin Conference 2025 Donald Trump Jr. & Eric Trump Both predicted that Bitcoin could clear $170,000 by the end of 2026. Donald Jr. specifically stated that it could trade between $175,000 and $150,000 by that time. These predictions reflect a growing alignment between political figures and pro-Bitcoin narratives, possibly signaling stronger policy support ahead. Adam Back Adam Back, the CEO of Blockstream, reiterated his earlier forecast that Bitcoin could hit $1 million if the U.S. establishes a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . Such a move could reshape global monetary policy and offer Bitcoin a role comparable to sovereign reserves of gold. Michael Saylor The MicroStrategy co-founder is known for his long-term bullish stance. Earlier, in November, he even called on top tech companies to consider adopting his company’s aggressive Bitcoin purchase strategy . MicroStrategy is the largest public company by BTC holdings. Saylor previously forecasted that BTC could reach $13 million in the next 24 years — a prediction grounded in the idea that Bitcoin will become the primary global store of value. Arthur Hayes Arthur Hayes, the CIO of Maelstrom, repeated his prediction at the event that the Bitcoin price could hit $1 million by 2028 . His prediction is based on the expectation that the U.S. will need to significantly increase dollar liquidity, potentially devaluing fiat and boosting demand for alternative assets like Bitcoin. David Sacks David Sacks, the AI & Crypto Czar at The White House, hinted that the U.S. government may be exploring Bitcoin purchases , stating: “The Treasury and Commerce Departments are exploring budget-neutral ways to acquire Bitcoin without raising taxes or debt.” If realized, such initiatives could further legitimize Bitcoin’s role in national financial strategies. Bo Hines Bo Hines, Executive Director of the President’s Council of Advisors for Digital Asset at The White House, emphasized the administration’s commitment to Bitcoin. He stated that the U.S. government has no intention to sell its Bitcoin holdings and aims to accumulate more through strategic reserves — a move that could indicate Bitcoin’s integration into long-term national asset planning. Conclusion In conclusion, the Bitcoin Conference 2025 showcased bold predictions and growing institutional interest, highlighting Bitcoin’s rising role in global finance . With projections ranging from $170,000 to $13 million, influential voices suggest a bullish long-term outlook, especially amid signals of potential U.S. government involvement in strategic Bitcoin accumulation and policy support. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

You can have tax-exempt bonds and other bonds. It is time for the first time in the history of this city to have a financial instrument that is made for those who are holders of Bitcoin,” he said.“I believe we need to have a Bitbond, and I am going to push and fight to get a Bitbond in New York so you can do those same bond investments in New York City.”New York City Mayor Eric Adams wants a Bitcoin bond and to axe the State BitLicense program. BitSource: YouTubeAdams didn’t share details about how a Bitbond would work; however, a March 31 policy brief paper from advocacy group the Bitcoin Policy Institute proposed a model where holders receive an annual interest rate of 1% for 10 years.When the bond matures, holders also receive a percentage of any Bitcoin market gains. At the same time, 90% of the funds raised through the bonds are allocated to government spending, while 10% is used to purchase Bitcoin, according to the Bitcoin Policy Institute’s bond policy brief.Adams again pushes to axe BitLicenseAdams also called for repealing New York’s BitLicense program, which the state launched in 2015 ﻿and requires crypto businesses to apply for a license with the New York Department of Financial Services and meet strict compliance standards.The BitLicense program has received criticism from the industry, and Adams has also said the measure is too costly with high licensing fees, and is too stringent with its Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer measures. “You have a mayor who is the crypto mayor, is the Bitcoin mayor, and I want you back in the city of New York, where you won’t be attacked and criminalized,” he said.“Let’s get rid of the Bitcoin license and allow us to have the free flow of Bitcoin in our city.”Related: NYC Mayor doubles down on crypto push ahead of city summitUSDC stablecoin issuer Circle was one of the first crypto companies to receive a BitLicense; others have since followed, including crypto exchange Coinbase and trading firm Bakkt.Adams has been actively pushing to attract crypto firms to New York City.

Source: CoinMarketCapThe Trump administration has reportedly filed an appeal to the court’s decision and Hundal said that regardless of whether it presents a new justification for the tariffs, the market sentiment has already changed.“It blows a hole in trade talks either way, and that means we’re likely to witness a significant repositioning in the market.”On April 2, Trump signed an executive order and claimed emergency powers, levying so-called “reciprocal tariffs” on every country starting at 10%.Trump’s initial tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China, introduced in early February, were widely seen as the primary catalyst behind Bitcoin falling below $100,000 and staying under the psychological level until May 8, as broader macroeconomic uncertainty intensified.“The trade war likely delayed a meaningful greed, really — but it didn’t bury it. The trend is higher,” Hundal said. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said, “Buy everything round dos.”Traders ponder “green candles” tomorrowCrypto analyst Bitcoin Ranchy said, “So Trump tariffs are illegal? Does that mean we get green candles all around tomorrow?”Hundal said “a wall of money” is coming into Bitcoin through corporations, spot Bitcoin ETFs and retail.

However, he added that the time he spent on DOGE wasn’t as significant as many believed, and he blamed media coverage for overrepresenting his involvement.“It’s not like I left the companies. It was just relative time allocation that probably was a little too high on the government side, and I’ve reduced that significantly in recent weeks.”When Musk announced in Tesla’s first quarter report that his time spent on DOGE would drop significantly in May, Tesla (TSLA) shares rose over 5% in after-hours trading, despite the company reporting an 80% drop in net income.As of March 31, Tesla still held 11,509 Bitcoin (BTC), currently valued at about $1.24 billion.Related: Musk confirms X Money beta testing ahead of planned 2025 launchTesla shares are still down 5.9% year to date, in part due to Musk diverting his attention away from the company and Tesla’s sales falling considerably in the first quarter.However, the fall is in line with other Big Tech firms, including Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG), which are also in the red in 2025.Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/elon-musk-leaves-doge-admit-tougher-than-expected?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Initial financing is secured and we are ready to accelerate from here!” he added in another post. The convertible loans total 45 million Swedish krona ($4.6 million), are interest-free and mature on June 30, 2028. The remaining 15 million Swedish krona ($1.5 million) will come through a new share issuance and warrants, according to K33. If investors convert their warrants before March 2026, they are entitled to additional free warrants at the same conversion rate.

However, the altcoin has maintained a positive signal by closing above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) for three consecutive weeks. This critical level has historically acted as a catalyst for significant price rallies.Solana 1-week chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIn late 2023, SOL broke through the 50-week and 100-week EMAs, solidifying its position above these levels before surging 515% by March 2024. The relative strength index or RSI on the weekly chart is currently at 52.60, indicating growing buying pressure. This setup mirrors past patterns where SOL broke above the 50-week EMA and rallied significantly. With current technicals aligning, SOL appears poised to retest the $300 level by late 2025, a key psychological and historical resistance.Using trend-based Fibonacci (FIB) extensions, SOL’s potential upside could be more compelling. The FIB extension, taken to the January highs of $295 from the recent swing lows near $95, outlines an immediate target of around $300, or a 70% increase.Solana Fibonacci trend extension analysis.

According to CoinGlass, Solana futures open interest (OI) stands at $7.5 billion — just $1 billion short of its Jan. 19, 2025, peak of $8.5 billion. Elevated OI levels typically signal heightened speculative interest and suggest that traders are positioning for significant price volatility.Solana futures open interest. Source: CoinGlassFunding rates across exchanges have also turned negative, indicating a tilt toward short positions as SOL struggles to reclaim the key $180 resistance. While this often reflects bearish sentiment, it also opens the door for a potential short squeeze. Crypto futures analyst Byzantine General pointed out that current market conditions — characterized by elevated OI, rising aggregated volume, and relatively muted cross-exchange funding — suggest that SOL price may be stabilizing. He noted this setup could catalyze a sharp upside move, with the possibility of a breakout toward the $300 level if momentum builds.Solana price, aggregated open interest, volume, and funding rate.

Despite the recent gains, Ether is down 21% in 2025, while the broader cryptocurrency market has seen a 5% increase.Ether bulls are motivated to keep ETH above $2,600 ahead of the monthly expiry. However, weak network activity on Ethereum suggests that the upside potential may be limited.Ether/USD (blue) vs. Total crypto capitalization (green). Source: TradingView / CointelegraphAnalysts believe Ether’s underperformance stems from rising competition among blockchains focused on decentralized applications. Still, ETH holds a key advantage as the only altcoin with a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) offering in the United States. These ETFs attracted $287 million in net inflows between May 19 and May 27, reflecting increased interest from institutional investors.Even as demand for Ether-based investment products grows, deposits and onchain activity on the Ethereum network have declined. This trend is especially troubling as rivals like Solana, BNB Chain, and Tron continue to gain market share.

Source: Laevitas.chEven though the $1.3 billion in call (buy) options dominate the May 30 expiry, that doesn’t necessarily imply that those traders will reinvest the proceeds in new bullish positions. Many option strategies involve multiple maturities and are structured in ways that don’t benefit from ETH rising above specific thresholds. Additionally, traders may hedge their exposure through futures markets.The $1.1 billion in put (sell) options were clearly caught off guard, as 97% were set at $2,600 or lower. These contracts will expire worthless if ETH holds above that level at 8:00 am UTC on May 30. While this imbalance is unusual, a similar outcome could affect the overly optimistic call options with strike prices at $2,800 and above if ETH remains near current levels.Related: SharpLink launches Ethereum treasury, taps Joe Lubin as board chairBelow are four likely scenarios based on current price trends. These outcomes estimate theoretical profits based on open interest imbalances and do not account for complex strategies.Between $2,300 and $2,500: $420 million in calls (buy) vs. $220 million in puts (sell). The net result favors the call instruments by $200 million.Between $2,500 and $2,600: $500 million calls vs. $130 million puts, favoring calls by $370 million.Between $2,600 and $2,700: $590 million calls vs. $35 million puts, favoring calls by $555 million.Between $2,700 and $2,900: $780 million calls vs. $10 million puts, favoring calls by $770 million.Bulls are strongly incentivized to push ETH past $2,700, yet the broader context may override those efforts. Given the strong correlation between cryptocurrencies and the S&P 500, macroeconomic indicators and corporate earnings are likely to remain the primary forces shaping investor risk appetite—and ultimately, ETH’s price at the time of the monthly options expiry.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The move could give asset managers more flexibility to include digital assets in retirement investment options.The government agency removed the guidance asserting that it represented a departure from the department’s “historically neutral, principled-based approach to fiduciary investment decisions.”“We’re rolling back this overreach and making it clear that investment decisions should be made by fiduciaries, not D.C. bureaucrats,” said US Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer.

2025-05-28T21:22:22.000Z,"Bitcoin analyst says BTC price peak in $220K to $330K range still possible","Key takeaways:Bitcoin researcher Sminston With says BTC could gain 100% to 200%, with a cycle peak between $220,000 to $330,000.Bitcoin continues to exhibit strong cyclical volatility, contradicting the belief that its price swings are softening over time.Over $4 billion in BTC has been moved by long-term holders, warning of a price correction.Analysis from Bitcoin (BTC) researcher Sminston With implied that a BTC price peak is still 100% to 200% away from current prices. In a recent X post, With shared a Bitcoin price chart using a 365-day simple moving average (SMA) aligned with a power law model (R²=0.96). The model suggests Bitcoin’s price follows a predictable, non-random pattern over time, distinct from the exponential growth models often applied to stocks and equities.Bitcoin power law fit analysis by Sminston With. Source: XThe chart revealed that Bitcoin’s 365-day SMA typically peaks 2 to 3 times above the power law trendline in each market cycle. With Bitcoin priced at $110,000 on May 27, this model projects a potential cycle top between $220,000 and $330,000. This forecast aligns with historical patterns, where Bitcoin has consistently overshot this trendline during bullish phases, offering an optimistic outlook for investors.A second graph in the post highlights Bitcoin’s price deviation from the power law fit, showing steady cyclical volatility without exponential decay in sustained peaks. This challenges the common belief that Bitcoin’s price cycles are becoming less extreme over time, indicating that the cryptocurrency’s volatility remains a defining trait, potentially leading to significant price swings over the next few months. In Q3 2024, With accurately predicted that Bitcoin would reach a six-figure price by January 2025, when BTC was trading around $60,000. The analysis examined each decaying peak by assessing BTC’s price at cycle highs. A decaying period in an investment cycle occurs when a strategy’s returns decline as the opportunity becomes widely adopted, culminating in a peak where the asset’s value drops sharply, leading to mass profit-taking.With’s quarter-on-quarter price targets for 2025, as outlined in this analysis, are summarized below.Bitcoin returns in 2025 based on decaying peaks.

2025-05-28T16:35:00.000Z,"Coinbase data breach 2025: What was stolen and what you need to know","Background of Coinbase’s May 2025 breach              Coinbase, America’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, received an unsolicited email from an unknown threat actor on May 11, 2025. They claimed to possess sensitive information about its customers and demanded a ransom of $20 million. Before examining the breach, it is interesting to understand how it happened at a public company that spends millions monthly on cybersecurity. In February, blockchain investigator ZachXBT reported increased thefts involving Coinbase users. He blamed aggressive risk models and pointed out Coinbase’s failure to prevent $300 million in yearly losses from social engineering scams. A table ZachXBT shared on X showed $65 million stolen from users between December 2024 and January 2025. He also said the real losses could be higher, as his data only came from his direct messages about onchain thefts, and excluded Coinbase support tickets and police reports he couldn’t access. The fear of cybercriminals stealing valuable information came true on May 11 when Coinbase published a blog post confirming that account balances, ID images, phone numbers, home addresses and partially hidden bank details were stolen during the data breach.On May 21, the same threat actor swapped about $42.5 million from Bitcoin (BTC) to Ether (ETH) via THORChain. They used Ethereum transaction input data to write “L bozo,” following it with a meme video of NBA player James Worthy smoking a cigar, seemingly mocking ZachXBT, who later flagged the message on his Telegram channel.                  What happened: Timeline of the Coinbase breach              The 2025 Coinbase breach wasn’t a typical crypto hack involving smart contracts or blockchain vulnerabilities. Instead, it was like a traditional IT security failure, marked by insider manipulation, corporate espionage and an extortion attempt.Below is a breakdown of how the incident unfolded:Insider recruitment and information theft began: To steal information from Coinbase, unknown cyber attackers began recruiting some overseas customer service agents (based in India) working for Coinbase. These insiders were paid to leak sensitive customer data and internal documentation, particularly that around customer service and account management systems. The stolen information was intended for future impersonation scams targeting users.Security detection and employee termination: Coinbase’s internal security team eventually detected suspicious activity linked to these employees. The involved staff were swiftly terminated, and the company alerted affected users. Though just 69,461 accounts were impacted, a fraction of Coinbase’s user base, the depth of stolen personal data made the breach significant.Extortion attempt via email (May 11, 2025): Coinbase received an unsolicited email claiming to possess internal system details and personally identifiable information (PII). This was later confirmed as credible in an 8-K SEC filing. Coinbase refuses to pay $20M ransom (May 14, 2025): Rather than accepting extortion, Coinbase flipped the script. The company reported the breach to law enforcement, disclosed it publicly and offered a $20 million reward for information leading to the attackers’ arrest, turning defense into offense. Breach disclosure and public notification: Shortly after the SEC filing, Coinbase publicly confirmed the breach, clarifying the scope and nature of the attack. A data breach notification was filed with the Maine Attorney General’s office, officially stating 69,461 users were affected. This timeline reflects how a crypto company responded differently to an attempted cyber-extortion, with transparency, resistance and bold countermeasures. This may bring in a change in the way companies respond to threats from cyber criminals.Did you know? North Korea’s Lazarus Group has stolen over $6 billion in crypto since 2017, including a record-breaking $1.46 billion from Bybit in 2025.                   What data was compromised in the Coinbase data breach in 2025?              According to a notification letter issued by Coinbase, attackers sought this information because they planned to launch social engineering attacks. The information they stole could help them appear credible to victims and possibly convince them to move their funds.Coinbase detailed the information the threat actors had got access to and what they could not. What attackers gotName, address, phone, and emailGovernment‑ID images (e.g., driver’s license, passport)Masked Social Security (last four digits only)Account data (balance snapshots and transaction history)Masked bank account numbers and some bank account identifiersLimited corporate data (including documents, training material, and communications available to support agents)What attackers couldn’t getLogin credentials or 2FA codesPrivate keysAccess to Coinbase Prime accountsAny ability to move or access customer fundsAccess to any Coinbase or Coinbase customer hot or cold walletsDid you know? In 2022, Crypto.com lost $30 million from 483 accounts. Initially, they claimed no funds were stolen, but later admitted the breach and refunded victims, highlighting the importance of transparency in crypto hacks.                  How Coinbase responded to the 2025 criminal data breach              In response to the 2025 data breach, Coinbase implemented a comprehensive strategy to mitigate damage, support affected users and strengthen its security infrastructure.Key actions taken by Coinbase included:Refusal to pay ransom: Coinbase declined the $20 million ransom demanded by the attackers. Instead, the company established a $20 million reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible.Customer reimbursements: The company committed to reimbursing customers who were deceived into sending funds due to the breach. Estimated costs for remediation and reimbursements range between $180 million and $400 million.Theft protection services: The company is providing all affected individuals with one year of complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services. This includes credit monitoring, a $1 million insurance reimbursement policy, identity restoration services, and dark web monitoring to detect if any personal information appears on illicit online platforms.Enhanced customer safeguards: Affected accounts will require additional ID verification for large withdrawals, including mandatory scam-awareness prompts to prevent further social engineering attacks.Strengthened support operations: Coinbase is opening a new support hub in the US. It has implemented stronger security controls and monitoring across all locations to prevent insider threats.Collaboration with law enforcement: The company is cooperating closely with US and international law enforcement agencies. Insiders involved in the breach were terminated and referred for criminal prosecution.Transparency and communication: Coinbase immediately notified affected customers once the breach was recognized. It is providing ongoing updates about the breach and the steps being taken to address it.These measures reflected Coinbase's commitment to customer protection and its proactive approach to cybersecurity challenges.Did you know? Crosschain bridges, like Nomad Bridge, lost $190 million in 2022 due to complex smart contract vulnerabilities. These bridges are hacker favorites because they store massive crypto assets, making them lucrative targets.                  How to stay safe in the event of Coinbase-like data breaches              In the wake of large-scale data breaches of crypto platforms, you should take proactive steps to protect yourself from social engineering attacks. Here is how you could stay safe in such an event:Never share sensitive information with impersonators: Scammers often pose as support staff or security agents after a breach. They may push you toward moving funds to crypto wallets they share with you or revealing sensitive information under various texts. Never share your password, two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, or recovery phrases with such impersonators. No crypto exchange will ask you to transfer crypto to a “new” or “safe” wallet. Turn on allow-listing of wallet addresses: Some exchanges provide this feature, which restricts withdrawals to pre-approved wallet addresses you fully control. This prevents unauthorized transfers even if your account is compromised. Enable strong 2FA: For 2FA, use a hardware security key or a trusted authentication app. Avoid relying on SMS-based 2FA, which is vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks. Be cautious with unsolicited communication: Hang up immediately if someone calls claiming to be from a crypto platform and asks for security credentials or requests asset transfers. Do not respond to unknown texts or emails with your personal information. Lock first, investigate later: If anything feels suspicious, lock your account immediately through the app or platform and report the incident to customer support via official channels. Stay informed: Regularly review security tips and updates from your crypto services to recognize and avoid evolving scam tactics.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/coinbase-data-breach-2025-what-was-stolen-and-what-you-need-to-know?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-28T15:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin’s physical infrastructure is the industry’s most overlooked asset","Opinion by: Scott Buchanan, chief operating officer of Bitcoin DepotA new proposal to install Bitcoin ATMs in federal buildings highlights an important question: Can crypto truly go mainstream without a stronger physical presence? For years, the industry has focused on software and decentralization, but its reluctance to invest in real-world infrastructure is starting to show. Without physical access points, crypto risks becoming an exclusive, insiders-only system, rather than the open alternative it sets out to be.Everyone loves to talk about decentralization. There’s a good reason behind this. It defines the movement, shapes the technology, and supports the vision of a better financial system. While the industry focuses on code and algorithms, it lacks something basic. A decentralized system that exists only online is not genuinely decentralized.Physical infrastructure is the missing linkBitcoin’s physical infrastructure is the missing link. Without tools like ATMs, kiosks and access points at traditional retail locations, crypto remains out of reach for millions. Decentralization is not just about removing intermediaries. True decentralization requires expanding access. Without real-world touchpoints, even the most advanced network becomes limited to a closed circle of insiders.Recent: Arizona governor kills two crypto bills, cracks down on Bitcoin ATMsFor crypto to become mainstream, it must be easy to reach digitally and physically. That means showing up in places people already go and seamlessly integrating into people’s lives. Many groups in the American population still rely on cash or don’t have access to traditional banks. According to the latest Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation report, around 5.6 million American households don’t have a bank or savings account. Bitcoin ATMs give these users access without needing an app, a bank account or a crash course in blockchain. Most crypto tools today assume a level of financial fluency and infrastructure that millions simply do not have. The result is a digital-only ecosystem that locks out newcomers and widens the divide between early adopters and everyone else.User-friendly screen in the right placePhysical infrastructure helps address this issue. A Bitcoin ATM in a grocery store or gas station is not just a convenience but a bridge to financial inclusion. It is an invitation to someone who has never bought crypto, telling them they can participate. No bank, no broker, just a user-friendly screen in a familiar place.These machines also generate new economic activity. Local businesses benefit from increased foot traffic as the kiosks create passive revenue. For many communities, they provide access to a parallel financial system that was previously out of reach. This is a tangible example of crypto’s real-world utility. It is already happening, and it is measurable.The crypto industry’s blind spotThe industry often treats physical infrastructure like an afterthought. The obsession with building new digital solutions has created a blind spot. Innovation without usability builds systems that serve the few but exclude the many. If someone can buy Bitcoin (BTC) at the same place they buy their morning coffee, that is when crypto stops feeling like an obscure digital asset and starts becoming part of everyday life.As governments increase regulation, trusted and transparent interfaces will become more important. When operated within regulatory frameworks, Bitcoin ATMs offer a way to provide access between traditional finance and digital assets. They are familiar, easy to monitor and offer a more approachable entry point for the general public.Like any financial tool, Bitcoin ATMs have drawn scrutiny, particularly in cases where bad actors use them. Rather than dismissing the machines themselves, we should focus on investing in better oversight, stronger consumer education and smarter regulation. The overwhelming majority of people who use Bitcoin ATMs do so for legitimate reasons: to send remittances, to move money securely or to access digital assets without traditional banking barriers. Building trust does not mean avoiding or dismantling physical access, but improving it.The first time someone uses Bitcoin should not involve reading a white paper or navigating a tutorial. It should be as familiar as using an ATM or tapping a payment terminal. This is not an argument against innovation. Software and protocols will continue to evolve and play an important role. Physical infrastructure provides something those tools cannot: trust through presence. When people can see and use crypto in their neighborhood, at a store they already visit or in a format they already understand, it changes how they think about crypto and who it is for. According to Coin ATM Radar, there are over 30,000 Bitcoin ATMs in the US. It’s a meaningful start, but still only a small step toward widespread access. Crypto’s long-term success will depend not just on innovation but also on inclusion. That means building more than networks; it means building presence. When people can interact with crypto in the physical world, it stops being abstract and becomes usable. That is how digital finance becomes everyday finance.Opinion by: Scott Buchanan, chief operating officer of Bitcoin Depot.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-28T15:00:00.000Z,"Polygon-backed, high-yield blockchain launches for institutional adoption","The Katana Foundation, a nonprofit focused on decentralized finance (DeFi) development, is launching its private mainnet, aiming to unlock greater crypto asset productivity via deeper liquidity and higher yields for users.The Katana Foundation launched a DeFi-optimized, private blockchain, Katana, on May 28, incubated by GSR Markets and Polygon Labs, with the public mainnet launch set for June.The new blockchain will enable users to earn higher yields and explore DeFi in a “unique, optimized yield environment” that unlocks latent value through an ecosystem that makes every digital asset “work harder,” according to an announcement shared with Cointelegraph.“DeFi users deserve ecosystems that prioritize sustainable liquidity and consistent ‘real’ yields,” wrote Marc Boiron, the CEO of Polygon Labs and core contributor at Katana, adding: “Katana’s user-centric model turns inefficiencies into advantages, establishing a truly positive-sum environment for builders and participants alike.\""Source: KatanaKatana aims to solve the crypto industry’s liquidity fragmentation issue, which can cause significant price slippage, as one of the main barriers limiting institutional DeFi participationRelated: Here’s how abstraction minimizes fragmentation in DeFi, making it more fluidTo reduce the value slippage in DeFi, Katana’s blockchain concentrates the liquidity from numerous protocols and collects yields on all potential sources to create an ecosystem with deeper liquidity and more predictable lending and borrowing rates.2025 Institutional Investor Digital Assets Survey. Source: EY-ParthenonInstitutional participation in DeFi is set to triple over the next two years to 75% from 24% of 350 surveyed institutional investors, according to management consulting firm EY-Parthenon.To tackle the growing institutional liquidity needs, Katana’s liquidity pool is composed of multiple protocols, including lending protocol Morpho, decentralized exchange (DEX) Sushi and perpetual DEX Vertex, enabling users to trade “blue-chip assets” without needing crosschain transfers.Katana has also incorporated Conduit’s sequences and Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network.Related: Polygon CEO: DeFi must ditch hype for sustainable liquidityKatana to compound DeFi yield from “Ethereum-based opportunities”Katana aims to boost sustainable yield by building a cohesive DeFi ecosystem. For instance, VaultBridge deploys bridged assets into overcollateralized, curated lending strategies on Ethereum via Mopho to earn yield, which is routed back and compounded on Katana.The protocol will reinvest network fees and a portion of application revenue back into its ecosystem.“This reduces reliance on short-term incentives, generates consistent yield, and as it grows, acts as an increasingly stable backstop during periods of volatility and liquidity shocks,” Polygon Labs’ Boiron told Cointelegraph, adding:“Yield is distributed pro-rata to each chain using VaultBridge protocol based on their share of total deposits into VaultBridge.”“So if Katana supplies 20% of the total vault deposits, it receives 20% of the yield back,” he added.Katana will subsequently allocate its share of yield to users through boosted DeFi incentives across “core apps” such as Sushi, Morpho or Vertex. The yield is generated from “Ethereum-based opportunities and then enhanced through Katana’s core applications,” said Boiron.Polygon Labs’ CEO previously criticized DeFi protocols for fueling a cycle of “mercenary capital” by offering sky-high annual percentage yields (APYs) through token emissions. Beyond infrastructure-related limitations, regulatory uncertainty remains another significant barrier to institutional DeFi adoption.2025 Institutional Investor Digital Assets Survey.

2025-05-28T14:15:00.000Z,"Elderly crypto investors are getting scammed: Teach them these key safety tips","Why are seniors being targeted in crypto scams?              Scammers prey on seniors because they view them as financially secure, trusting and less familiar with rapidly evolving technology.Let’s understand why seniors are key targets.Perception of wealth: Many older adults have retirement savings or pensions, making them lucrative targets.Lower tech fluency: Navigating crypto wallets, private keys and blockchain concepts can be intimidating, something scammers exploit.Embarrassment prevents reporting: Victims often feel ashamed, making them less likely to report the crime.Crypto is irreversible: Once funds are sent via Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, there’s no reversing the transaction. That’s a dream scenario for scammers.According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), seniors report growing losses linked to cryptocurrency investment fraud, romance scams and government impersonation. In South Carolina’s Beaufort County alone, seniors reported over $3.1 million in crypto scam losses in 2024.And these scams are becoming more sophisticated. AI tools can now clone voices, spoof caller IDs and create fake websites that mimic legitimate exchanges or financial institutions to steal from unsuspecting seniors.                  Examples of crypto scams targeting older adults              From crypto romance fraud in Cambodia targeting British pensioners to ATM scams in Minnesota and impersonation schemes across the US, scammers have stolen millions by preying on older adults’ trust and unfamiliarity with digital assets.1. Cambodian scam compounds exploiting British pensionersIn Bavet, Cambodia, scam compounds operated by networks linked to the Chinese mafia have been uncovered. These operations enslave trafficked workers, forcing them to participate in romance and cryptocurrency fraud. British pensioners have been prime targets, suffering significant losses.. One victim from the West Midlands lost over 250,000 British pounds ($340,000). These scams often employ “pig-butchering” tactics, cultivating trust online before executing large-scale financial fraud.2. Crypto ATM scams in MinnesotaIn Minnesota, over 5,500 incidents involving cryptocurrency kiosks led to losses exceeding $189 million in 2023. Seniors were the most vulnerable victims, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the stolen funds. Scammers often direct victims to transfer funds using QR codes tied to fraudulent accounts. Cities like Stillwater have implemented bans on crypto ATMs to protect residents.3. Romance scam targeting a disabled woman in the UKLisa Nock, a 44-year-old woman from Staffordshire with autism and mobility issues, fell victim to a romance scam after being targeted on Instagram by someone impersonating Australian TV vet Dr. Chris Brown. Over 18 months, the scammer manipulated her into transferring £11,000 in cryptocurrency, claiming the funds were for flights, visas and hiring a substitute vet. Lisa eventually realized the deceit and reported the fraud to authorities.4. Government or bank impersonators demanding crypto paymentsScammers may impersonate the IRS, Social Security Administration, Medicare or local law enforcement. Their script is simple: You’re in legal trouble or owe back taxes, and the only way to avoid arrest or penalties is to pay in Bitcoin.This tactic has been used across the US. In South Carolina, a retired healthcare worker named Marianne was told she missed jury duty and owed $7,500. Following fake sheriff’s instructions, she fed the cash into a Coinstar crypto ATM, which instantly converted her money to Bitcoin and sent it straight to scammers.5. Ohio woman loses life savings in cryptocurrency investment scam An Ohio woman lost her life savings in a cryptocurrency investment scam that defrauded victims of about $4.9 million. The scheme involved 33 identified victims nationwide, with five more accounts under FBI investigation.Did you know? A $243 million Bitcoin heist involving a fake Google call spiraled into a real-world kidnapping plot straight out of a Netflix thriller.                  7 Key safety tips every elderly crypto investor should know              Elderly investors should follow key safety steps like never sending crypto to strangers, verifying suspicious contacts, enabling two-factor authentication, avoiding public WiFi and discussing large transactions with trusted family before acting.Here are the key safety tips every elderly crypto investor should be aware of:Never send crypto to strangers: If someone you’ve never met in person asks for Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies,  it’s almost certainly a scam. This includes social media, messages on Facebook, emails from supposed tech support or even someone you’ve been chatting with on a dating site. No legitimate person or organization will randomly ask for crypto. If you’re being told, “Send me $500 and I’ll send back $1,000,” you’re being conned. Always assume unsolicited crypto requests are fraudulent.Double-check all contacts: If you get a call, email, or text from a bank, the IRS or even a family member in crisis, don’t respond immediately. Call the official number on your bank card or government website to verify.Use trusted wallets and exchanges only: Stick to platforms with strong security and regulation like Coinbase, Kraken and Binance.US. Avoid apps from unknown websites or links in emails.Watch for pressure tactics: Scammers thrive on urgency; you only have two hours to pay; act now to claim your prize. Real financial institutions do not use this kind of pressure.Set up two-factor authentication (2FA): All crypto wallets and exchange accounts should have 2FA enabled. This adds a second layer of protection even if a password is stolen.Avoid public WiFi for crypto transactions: Never send crypto or log in to financial apps over public WiFi at coffee shops, airports or hotels. These networks are often unsecured and can be intercepted by hackers. Use your home WiFi or mobile data instead, and ensure your device has up-to-date antivirus protection.Talk to family before big transactions: Before sending large amounts of crypto or any money, have a quick conversation with someone you trust. Scammers often isolate victims and make them feel they must act alone. Encourage seniors to adopt a simple rule: If it’s more than $100, talk to someone first. A five-minute phone call could prevent a five-figure mistake.                  Think grandma got scammed? Here’s what to do immediately              If you’ve been scammed, act fast: Report it to the crypto exchange (they might freeze the funds), file a fraud report with the FTC or Chainabuse and contact elder support services for guidance and protection.1. Report the scam to the exchangeIf the funds were sent through Coinbase, Binance or another exchange, contact them right away. Some may be able to freeze accounts if action is taken quickly.2. File a report with law enforcement and the FTCCall your local police department.Report fraud to the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov.You can also report crypto fraud at Chainabuse.com, a trusted crypto crime reporting platform.3. Contact elder support resourcesElderCare Locator (USA): Connects older adults and families to local services, including Adult Protective Services for financial exploitation cases.Action Fraud (UK): The UK’s national fraud reporting center for scams, including those involving crypto.Scamwatch, ACCC (Australia): Provides scam alerts and allows reporting of cryptocurrency and financial scams affecting seniors.Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (Canada): A national agency for reporting and tracking fraud, including crypto scams targeting older adults.National Council on Aging – NCOA (US): Offers educational resources and scam prevention tools for seniors and caregivers.Age UK (UK): Provides advice and support for older people facing financial abuse, including online and crypto scams.Did you know? Hackers have been caught selling counterfeit smartphones infected with the Triada Trojan, malware that steals crypto and sensitive data by deeply embedding itself in the device’s system.                  Is crypto safe for seniors?              Yes, but only with proper education and safeguards. Cryptocurrency can be empowering, offering independence and investment opportunities. However, seniors can become easy targets without a strong awareness of the risks.Scammers increasingly target seniors through sophisticated tactics like fake investment platforms, romance scams and impersonation of government or tech support personnel. These schemes often involve urgent demands, emotional manipulation or unfamiliar technologies like crypto ATMs.To minimize risk, seniors should be educated on the basics of cryptocurrency, recognize common fraud tactics, use reputable platforms and involve trusted family or advisers before making transactions. Awareness and vigilance are essential to protect both assets and peace of mind in the digital age.As crypto continues to go mainstream, scammers are adapting fast. Don’t let your loved ones get rug-pulled or emotionally manipulated into losing everything. Share these tips. Stay involved. And when in doubt, always verify before sending funds.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/elderly-crypto-investors-are-getting-scammed-teach-them-these-key-safety-tips?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

He added that he is confident many of those investors will cycle back into the crypto market to fuel the next big rally.2. Smart money agrees on Bitcoin’s year-end targetSeveral analysts have set $200,000 as their target for Bitcoin in 2025. Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets at Standard Chartered, has been one of the leading voices.Kendrick said in an email note seen by Cointelegraph that Bitcoin is expected to hit $120,000 in the first half of 2025 en route to $200,000 by year-end, fueled by the rise of stablecoins.Related: A Bitcoiner’s guide to South Africa’s Garden Route“The US Senate… voted 66-32 to advance the GENIUS Act,” Kendrick wrote in the email note. “The point of the stablecoin Act is that stablecoins will further legitimise the whole asset class.

David Geale, executive director of payments and digital finance at the FCA, said the agency aims to support innovation while ensuring market trust:“At the FCA, we have long supported innovation that benefits consumers and markets.

It marks the first monthly sales increase since the start of the year, suggesting renewed interest in digital collectibles. This follows a five-month decline in sales since volume peaked at over $900 million in December 2024. May also had the highest number of transactions in 2025, reaching 5.5 million, according to CryptoSlam. The sales uptick could also be attributed to the divergence between unique NFT buyers and unique NFT sellers.

In May, NFT sellers fell to around 284,600, the lowest amount recorded on the CryptoSlam platform since April 2021. The divergence between the growing buyer interest and shrinking seller activity could set the stage for more competitive bidding, which may lead to higher valuations. Chart compiled by Cointelegraph to demonstrate CryptoSlam data on NFT buyers and sellers.

These include AnchorZero, a platform helping crypto founders use Roth IRAs for tax advantages, and Spark Capital, a new venture focused on stablecoin infrastructure.Other portfolio companies include Ethena, ClearToken, Crossover Markets, Station70 and Theo — an onchain trading infrastructure project that recently raised $20 million from 17 different VC firms.The company plans to eventually back up to 30 companies with early-stage rounds ranging from $500,000 to $1 million.Metalayer was co-founded by Chainlink Labs’ former head of growth, Mickey Graham, and former Two Sigma executives Andy Kangpan and David Winton.Winton developed a proprietary data platform called Moirai to help Metalayer analyze developer activity, protocol engagement and blockchain transaction patterns to uncover promising projects. “Moirai is our internal sourcing engine for identifying early-stage crypto startups,” Graham told Cointelegraph in a written statement. “The platform is designed to help us systematically surface high-quality startups, and it evaluates opportunities across several key dimensions,” he said.Related: VC Roundup: 8-figure funding deals suggest crypto bull market far from overCrypto VC deals on the rise, but there’s a catchCrypto venture capital activity saw a notable uptick in the first quarter, with increases in both total funding and deal volume, according to data from Galaxy Digital. VC funding reached $4.9 billion during the quarter, though nearly half came from a single deal — Binance, which raised $2 billion from MGX, an investment firm backed by a United Arab Emirates sovereign wealth fund.Despite the outsized impact of the Binance deal, overall market activity showed signs of improving. A total of 446 crypto funding deals were recorded in Q1, marking a 7% increase from the previous quarter.Crypto VC deals remain considerably lower than the peak of the previous bull market. Source: GalaxyNevertheless, venture capital investors remain cautious about making fresh commitments to the sector, according to Robert Lee, a senior analyst at PitchBook. The first quarter was a challenging market environment as a sharp correction in crypto prices compounded investor reluctance.In an interview with Bloomberg last month, Lee noted that many venture capital firms are still on the sidelines. “[M]any of the funds from the last cycle have yet to deliver meaningful DPI,” he said, referring to the private equity metric Distributed to Paid-In Capital, which measures how much capital has been returned to investors relative to what they invested.Metalayer’s Mickey Graham believes that at least some of this drop-off is due to a much-needed transition happening beneath the surface:“We believe the crypto industry has crossed the chasm from an early market defined by infrastructure-building to a mainstream technology sector characterized by the deployment of blockchain technology throughout the global economy.”Although VC activity remains subdued compared to past bull cycles, Kadan Stadelmann, the chief technology officer of the Komodo Platform, told Cointelegraph that the industry has seen an “uptick in mergers and acquisitions, suggesting market maturation.”Stadelmann indicated that pro-crypto regulations in the United States and European Union, “have given large institutions confidence to continue making investments into crypto firms.”At a geographic level, the US accounted for more than a third of total crypto VC deals in 2024 — a trend expected to continue this year.

In his widely cited 2022 paper, “The Ineluctable Modality of Securities Law: Why Fungible Crypto Assets Are Not Securities,” he wrote:“[T]here is no current basis in the law relating to ‘investment contracts’ to classify most fungible crypto assets as ‘securities’ when transferred in secondary transactions.”In his paper, Cohen explained that in secondary transactions, an investment contract transaction is generally not present. He further claimed that fungible cryptocurrencies “neither create nor represent the necessary cognizable legal relationship between” a legal entity and the holder that is the “hallmark of a security.”Related: Banking groups ask SEC to drop cybersecurity incident disclosure ruleSEC’s “new paradigm”Ripple also referenced SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce's May 19 “new paradigm” speech. She said she’d been voicing her dissent with the regulator’s approach to crypto, adding:“Having emerged from the crypto dissent years, I am glad to be able speak to you today as the head of the Commission’s Crypto Task Force about a rational and coherent path forward and a new paradigm at the SEC.”Peirce said that the SEC’s “approach to crypto in recent years has evaded sound regulatory practice and must be corrected.” She also said that most cryptocurrencies are not securities, adding:“Most currently existing crypto assets in the market are not [securities]. My supplemental answer is that economic realities matter and non-security crypto assets may be distributed as part of an investment contract, which is a type of security.”Ripple’s long fight with the SECThe SEC had viewed a large portion of digital assets as securities, with the regulator’s former chair, Gary Gensler, stating in 2023 that most of the crypto market falls under the securities bracket. This stance led to a protracted legal battle between the SEC and Ripple.The lawsuit first began at the end of 2020, when the SEC took action against Ripple and its executives, claiming that XRP sales constituted unregistered security offerings. Still, after the government’s stance on crypto changed with the election of current US President Donald Trump, Ripple has mostly won the battle, with the SEC recently dropping its appeal against a ruling favorable to the company.In its recent letter to the SEC, Ripple also cited a ruling in the case noting that “the court held that certain of Ripple’s historical institutional sales of XRP were investment contracts,” while the secondary sales were not. Furthermore, the judge “determined that XRP itself is not a security.”Magazine: XRP win leaves Ripple and industry with no crypto legal precedent set",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-sec-letter-crypto-not-securities?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Five commissioners are supposed to make up the CFTC, and no more than three can be from the same political party.Goldsmith Romero said that during her tenure, all the commissioners had different perspectives and experiences that, when brought together, were “really helpful.”“So what happens if the CFTC gets down to one and gets new authority for crypto? It’s going to be really, really hard; you’re not going to have the same push and pull,” she said.The Trump administration has floated the idea of handing the reins of crypto regulation to the CFTC in the past. Congressional Republicans have also been drafting bills to give the CFTC greater oversight over the industry, Retail customer Definition should be CFTC priority In the future, Goldsmith Romero thinks the CFTC should work on defining a retail customer to ensure the influx of fresh investments in “crypto and some other products” has a similar retail customer protection regime to the Securities and Exchange Commission.Related: Crypto perp futures coming ‘very soon,’ says CFTC’s Mersinger“I came from the SEC with an investor protection regime, you want people to know their rights and risk if they take a risk and they lose that’s on them,” she said.“But you want to have some basic things like exchanges that are registered that have some basic requirements and have to follow the law and this is, I think, the main thing that needs to happen.”Goldsmith Romero said other “extremely basic” rules could include a ban against co-mingling a company’s assets with customer funds, and brokers, exchanges and clearing houses being required to register with the SEC, the CFTC or in some cases, both.Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/goldsmith-romero-cf-exodus-not-a-great-situation?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Kalashi settled a major legal battle with the CFTC over election betting earlier this month. Quintenz outlined the steps he will take to avoid conflicts of interest if confirmed as CFTC chairman in an agreement letter to John Einstman, the CFTC’s Designated Agency Ethics Official, dated May 21. “I will not participate personally and substantially in any particular matter in which I know that I have a financial interest directly and predictably affected by the matter,” he stated. Edit the caption here or remove the textAn excerpt of Brian Quintenz's letter.

The legislative text is focused on putting forward a regulatory framework in which we can enforce actions to strengthen this broader market, in particular to the benefit of American consumers and innovation and development here.”Democratic Senator Marker Warner voiced a similar sentiment before the GENIUS Act passed on May 19, stating that the US couldn’t “afford to keep standing on the sidelines” while the crypto industry evolves.“We cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay,” Warner said. “If American lawmakers don’t shape it, others will — and not in ways that serve our interests or democratic values.”Steil credits DemocratsSteil acknowledged that Democratic lawmakers have made an effort to better understand the crypto industry’s gripes with how the Biden administration handled regulation and enforcement of the sector.He said the political landscape and nature of crypto-related negotiations “looked a little different,” but over 70 Democrats in the last Congress signaled the need for clear crypto rules when the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) passed the House in May 2024.Related: Trump supports bill to buy 1 million BTC — Senator Lummis“I think that was a great practice run,” said Steil.The FIT21 Act wasn’t enacted before the end of the last Congress However, House Agricultural and Financial Services Committee chairs Glenn Thompson and French Hill introduced a new crypto market structure bill on May 5 that aims to build on FIT21.If lawmakers pass those bills, they will have the opportunity to explore a lot of other “interesting, creative ideas” in the space, Steil said.Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside storyAdditional reporting by Turner Wright",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/steil-wants-lawmakers-restrain-adding-non-relevant-items-crypto-bills?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-28T02:11:48.000Z,"Real-world assets could revitalize dying NFT lending market: DappRadar","Real-world assets linking up with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is one of a few key catalysts that could reignite the waning NFT lending sector, which is suffering from a collapse in volumes and user activity, says blockchain analytics platform DappRadar.Volumes in the NFT lending market, which allows NFT holders to take out a loan against their token, have dropped 97% from a peak of around $1 billion in January 2024 to $50 million in May, DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in a May 27 report.Gherghelas said for NFT lending to “move beyond survival mode,” it needs “new catalysts” to reignite the sector, such as real-world asset NFTs, like tokenized real estate or yield-bearing assets that could unlock more stable, trusted collateral sources.“So far, 2025 has not delivered a compelling reason for NFT lending to bounce back,” she said. “While the infrastructure is still here and the platforms remain active, activity has slowed across the board.” Borrower and leading activity have taken a big hit in the NFT lending sector. Source: DappRadar“For now, the sector seems to be in a holding pattern, waiting either for market recovery or a new use case to reignite interest.”Gherghelas added that other catalysts that could rekindle NFT lending were tools that make it easier for NFT holders to borrow against their tokens, and that protocols should create “smart infrastructure” such as undercollateralized loans, credit scores and artificial intelligence risk matching.The report adds that since January last year, borrower activity has declined by 90% and those willing to lend have shrunk by 78%.The average NFT loan size has also taken a hit from a peak of $22,000 in 2022 to $4,000 in May, a 71% year-over-year drop.Gherghelas said this shift “shows that either users are borrowing against lower-value assets or simply becoming more conservative with leverage.”NFT lending overall trading volume and market activity have dropped off from the all-time highs of past years. Source: DappRadarThe average loan duration is also lower; after hitting an average of roughly 40 days in 2023, it’s been down to 31 days and has held steady throughout 2024 and into 2025.Gherghelas said this could indicate that “loans are being taken more frequently but for shorter periods, perhaps a sign of more tactical liquidity plays.”NFT ﻿market downturn also hurts lendingPart of the slowdown in NFT lending is connected to the overall NFT market decline, which has seen volumes drop 61% in the first quarter to $1.5 billion compared to $4.1 billion a year ago.“With collateral value collapsing, the lending activity naturally followed,” Gherghelas said. “There are a few exceptions that managed to hold or regain traction, but they’ve been outliers, not enough to lift the sector.”Related: AI decentralized apps are coming for the Web3 throne: DappRadarThe protocol landscape has also narrowed, and the number of active NFT lending apps is limited, with only eight protocols holding any meaningful share.“The flip-for-liquidity model that worked during bull markets isn’t built for a quieter, more risk-averse environment. But that doesn’t mean NFT lending is finished; it’s simply shifting focus,” Gherghelas said.“Platforms are diversifying, use cases are shifting, and collateral preferences are changing. If the next wave builds on utility, culture, and better design, NFT lending might just find its second wind — one built to last.”Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/real-world-assets-revitalize-dying-nft-lending-dappradar?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
